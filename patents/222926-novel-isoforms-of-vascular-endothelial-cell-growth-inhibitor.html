CROSS -REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application serial<br>
number 60/331,190, filed November 9,2001. The priority application is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT<br>
This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Department of Defense<br>
grant DAMD17-98-1-8093; National Institutes of Health grant NHLBIRO1 HL60660; and<br>
National Cancer Institute grant CA58185-08. The Government has certain rights in the<br>
invention.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions that are useful in the treatment of<br>
conditions in which it is advantageous that angiogenesis is inhibited, for example, in the<br>
treatment of solid tumors, diabetic retinopathy, Kaposi's sarcoma, psoriasis, and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. In particular, the invention relates to novel isoforms of vascular endothelial growth<br>
inhibitors (VEGIs), their DNA and associated protein sequences, compositions and variants<br>
thereof, and their use in the treatment of angiogenesis-driven diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under normal physiological conditions, humans and animals undergo angiogenesis, the<br>
generation of new blood vessels into a tissue or organ, in very specific restricted situations.<br>
For example, angiogenesis is normally observed in wound healing, embryonal development, and<br>
formation of the corpus luteum, endometrium and placenta. The term "endothelium" means a<br>
thin layer of flat epithelial cells that lines serous cavities, lymph vessels and blood vessels. The<br>
term "anti-angiogenic" or "angiogenic inhibiting activity" means the capability of a molecule to<br>
inhibit angiogenesis in general.<br>
Both controlled and uncontrolled angiogenesis are thought to proceed in a similar<br>
manner. Endothelial cells are actively involved in inflammation, cell adhesion, coagulation,<br>
thrombosis, fibrinolysis, and angiogenesis. Endothelial cells and pericytes, surrounded by a<br>
basement membrane, form capillary blood vessels. Angiogenesis begins with the erosion of the<br>
basement membrane by enzymes released by endothelial cells and leukocytes. The endothelial<br>
cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, then protrude through the basement membrane.<br>
Angiogenic stimulants induce the endothelial cells to migrate through the eroded basement<br>
membrane. The migrating cells form a "sprout" off the parent blood vessel, where the endothelial<br>
cells undergo mitosis and proliferate. The endothelial sprouts merge with each other to form<br>
capillary loops, creating the new blood vessel.<br>
Persistent unregulated angiogenesis occurs in a multiplicity of disease states, tumor<br>
metastasis and abnormal growth by endothelial cells and supports the pathological damage seen<br>
in these conditions. The diverse pathological disease states in which unregulated angiogenesis is<br>
present have been grouped together as angiogenic dependent or angiogenic associated diseases.<br>
During tumor growth, endothelial cells proliferate, invade the stroma, migrate toward the<br>
source of angiogenic stimuli such as cancer cells, interact with perivascular cells and stromal<br>
cells, and eventually form capillary vessels linking the tumor tissue to the circulation (J.<br>
Folkman (1995) Nat. Med 1:27-31). Although the undoubtedly highly complex mechanism that<br>
regulates angiogenesis is yet to be understood, it is becoming clear that the initiation or<br>
termination of the process is a result of a balance between positive and negative regulators of<br>
angiogenesis. A number of angiogenic factors, often markedly upregulated in tumor tissues,<br>
have been described, including several members of the fibroblast growth factor family, such as<br>
FGF-I(G. Gimenez-Gallego et al. (1985) Science 230. .1385), FGF-2 (L. Schweigerer et al.<br>
(1987) Nature 325: 257), and those of the vascular endothelial cell growth factor family (VEGF)<br>
(D. W. Leung et al. (1989) Science 246: 1306), as well as the receptors of these growth factors<br>
(L. W. Burrus and B. B. Olwin (1989) JBiol. Chem. 264:18647; S. Wemistrom et al. (1991)<br>
Growth Factors 4:197; B. Tennan et al (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 187: 1579. C.<br>
de Vries et al., (1992) Science 255: 989). Recently, two new protein factors, proliferin and a<br>
proliferin-related protein, were found to participate in the regulation of the initiation and<br>
cessation of neovascularization in mouse placenta (Jackson D, et al. Science 266,1581-4,1994).<br>
All documents cited herein supra and infra are hereby expressly incorporated in their entirety by<br>
reference thereto.<br>
Several inhibitors of angiogenesis have also been reported, including thrombospondin<br>
(D. J Good et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:6624), angiostatin (M. S. O'Reilly et<br>
al. (1994) Cell 79:315), endostatin (M.S. O'Reilly et al. (1997) Cell 88: 277) and platelet factor-4<br>
(E. Maione et al. (1997) Science 247:77). It is apparent that normal angiogenesis is promptly<br>
activated when required, and swiftly terminated when no longer needed, whereas pathological<br>
angiogenesis, once initiated is often prolonged and difficult to stop. This indicates that the<br>
negative regulation mechanism functioning in a normal angiogenesis process is missing or<br>
suppressed in a pathological angiogenesis process. It has been suggested that proteolytic<br>
activities that release angiogenesis inhibitors from a number of precursors may account partly for<br>
down-regulation of angiogenesis, as indicated by the proteolytic activation of angiostatin from<br>
plasminogen and that of endostatin from collagen XVIII (M. S. O'Reilly, (1997) Cell 88:277).<br>
Many of the known angiogenesis regulators are pleiotrophic and can act on other cell types as<br>
well as the one that produces the regulators, although it is conceivable that endothelial cells may<br>
produce autocrine factors to suppress an angiogenic process or maintain the quiescence of a<br>
mature vasculature. It is therefore an object of the present application to describe novel autocrine<br>
negative regulators of angiogenesis of a class called Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Inhibitors<br>
(VEGI) that are specifically expressed by endothelial cells.<br>
Published PCT Application WO 99/23105 discloses a VEGI protein (VEGI-m) and a<br>
splice variant VEGI-251 and their corresponding nucleotide sequences, the disclosure of which is<br>
hereby expressly incorporated into the present application by reference in its entirety. Anti-<br>
angiogenic activity of N-terminal truncated forms of VEGI-174 was described. The protein<br>
VEGI-174 exhibited 20-30% sequence homology to human TNFa, TNFÃ, and the Fas ligand. A<br>
protein with a molecular weight of 22 kD was produced in an in vitro transcription and<br>
translation experiment using a cDNA clone as a template, consistent with the predicted open<br>
reading frame of 174 amino acids. This protein is herein referred to as VEGI-174.<br>
Hydrophobicity analysis of the protein predicted a 12-amino acid hydrophobic region<br>
immediately following the N-terminal segment of 14 non-hydrophobic amino acids. This was<br>
consistent with the structure of a type II transmembrane protein, similar to TNFs (B. B.<br>
Aggarwal and K. Natarajan (1996) Eur.Cytolane News. 7:93). An isoform of VEGI was also<br>
described. This protein is herein referred to as VEGI-251 which was predicted to be a membrane<br>
protein.<br>
Recent Northern analysis of total RNA preparations from 22 different types of cultured<br>
cells of various lineages indicated that transcripts for this protein can only be detected in two<br>
lines of endothelial cells: HUVE cells and human venous endothelial cells of an early passage. A<br>
mRNA was not detected in human venous endothelial cells of a later passage, nor was it seen in<br>
human artery cells. In sharp contrast, the TNF family members are mostly expressed in immune<br>
cells (B. B. Aggarwal and K. Natarajan (1996), supra). For instance, TNFa is produced by<br>
macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells, while TNFÃ is predominantly produced by<br>
mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes and leukocytes. Similarly, the ligands for Fas and other TNF<br>
family members, CD27, CD30, CD40, OX40, and 4-1 BB, are all expressed in cell types in the<br>
immune system. Using multiple tissue Northern blots, an EGI transcript was found to be<br>
expressed in placenta, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, liver, thymus, testis, ovary and<br>
peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
Inhibition of angiogenesis in a tumor is an important approach for the treatment of cancer<br>
such as breast and other solid tumors. First of all, tumor growth and metastasis are dependent on<br>
angiogenesis. It has been shown in a model system that blocking the capillaries of the tumor<br>
neovasculature by specifically induced coagulation gives rise to the eradication of the tumor<br>
vasculature and leads to abrogation of the tumors. In addition, it has been suggested that<br>
endothelial cells are highly proliferative in tumor tissues but are mostly quiescent in normal<br>
tissues. This makes the tumor neovasculature a specific and attractive target. Furthermore,<br>
while the characteristics of cancer cells may vary greatly in different tumors, the endothelial cell<br>
population in most solid tumors is likely to be untransformed, and thus remains homogeneous.<br>
This would apply for both human and animal subjects. It may therefore be possible to develop an<br>
antiangiogenic therapeutic agent that could be applied universally for the treatment of many<br>
different cancers.<br>
In addition to solid tumors, other important angiogenesis-driven diseases include diabetic<br>
retinopathy, Kaposi's sarcoma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who suffer from these<br>
diseases may benefit from an anti-angiogenic therapeutic approach.<br>
The present invention identifies and describes sequences, functions, compositions, and<br>
therapeutic uses of novel isoforms of members of the VEGI family of proteins. Two new<br>
isoforms that are termed VEGI-192a, and VEGI-192b respectively, comprise a novel N-terminal<br>
sequence that substantially alters the properties of the protein with respect to its expression,<br>
secretion, and anti-angiogenic properties.<br>
There are disclosed two new VEGI isoforms named VEGI192aand VEG192b, both<br>
consisting of 192 amino acid residues. Both isoforms show endothelial cell-specific expression<br>
and share a C-terminal 151-residues segment with the previously described VEGI-174 and VEGI-<br>
251. The isoforms are generated from a 17 kb human gene by alternative splicing. VEGI251, the<br>
most abundant isoform, contains a putative secretion signal. VEGI protein is detected in<br>
conditioned media of endothelial cells, human sera and VEGI251-transfected mammalian cells.<br>
Subcellular localization pattern of VEGI251 is suggestive of a secretory protein. Overexpression<br>
of VEGI251 in endothelial cells causes dose-dependent cell death. VEGI251-transfected cancer<br>
cells gave rise to xenograft tumors of reduced growth rate and microvessel density compared<br>
with tumors of VEGI174 transfectants. The invention provides a view that endothelial cell-<br>
secreted VEGI can function as an autocrine inhibitor of angiogenesis and a naturally existing<br>
modulator of vascular homeostasis.<br>

method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) contacting a sample from a subject suspected of having pathological angiogenesis with<br>
antibodies that are specific for the VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptides of the invention; and<br>
(ii) detecting the presence or absence of a complex formed between VEGI-192a, and/or<br>
VEGI-192b, and the antibodies.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the diagnosis of?<br>
pathological angiogenesis comprising detecting the presence or absence of VEGI-192a or VEGI-<br>
192b, polynucleotides (preferably RNA) in a sample, the method comprising the steps of.<br>
(i) contacting a sample from a subject suspected of having pathological angiogenesis with<br>
polynucleotides (such as oligonucleotides) that specifically bind VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b<br>

designing primers using the nucleotide sequence of VEGI isoform (i.e. VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b) as<br>
shown in SEQ ID NO:1, and SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the polymerase chain reaction specifically<br>
amplifies a region of VEGI as the basis for detection. The primers can be used to amplify VEGI<br>
DNA or VEGI RNA, the latter amplification occurring after RNA is converted into<br>
complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription of the RNA. The PCR assay can be made<br>
quantitative by comparing the amplified product to a standard, which can be generated using<br>
methods known in the art.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the detection of<br>
VEGI isoform (i.e. VEGI-192a, or VEGI-192b) polynucleotides in a sample, the method comprising<br>

detecting the presence of VEGI isoform in a sample. Since VEGI may function as a membrane<br>
protein, a naturally existing soluble form of membrane-bound VEGI may function as its<br>
antagonist, and methods for detecting the soluble form are included in another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a diagnostic assay comprising<br>
detecting the presence or absence of a mutation in VEGI isoform (i.e. VEGI-192a, or VEGI-192b)<br>

agents or drugs for angiogenic inhibitory activity by testing whether or not the drug or agent is<br>
capable of upregulating VEGI isoform (i.e., VEGI-192a, or VEGI-1921,) expression and/or activity.<br>
Since VEGI isoforms, like other angiogenic inhibitors, are activated by proteases which release<br>
the protein from the cell membrane, proteases, as well as other agents that facilitate such<br>
activation such as metal ions would be useful as agents for increasing the expression of VEGI<br>
isoforms.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for testing possible<br>
antitumor agents or drugs by testing whether or not the drug or agent is capable of inhibiting<br>
angiogenesis by upregulating VEGI isoform expression and/or activity.<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for testing possible<br>
drugs or agent which promote angiogenesis by testing whether or not the agent or drug can block<br>
and/or inhibit VEGI function (for example, inhibition of angiogenesis). In this case, inhibition of<br>
proteases which activate VEGI isoforms as discussed above or agents required for, or agents<br>
which facilitate such activation such as metal ions, can be used to down-regulate VEGI, thereby<br>
enhancing angiogenesis.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES:<br>
Figure 1. Serum VEGI level in normal adults. Serum from 40 normal volunteers (20 male, 20<br>

stably transfected MDA-MB231 cells expressing the indicated construct were injected<br>
subcutaneously into mammary fat pads of female athymic mice, and tumor sizes monitored in a<br>
blind manner. Control mice received MDA-MB231 cells transfected with empty pcDNA3<br>
vector. Attenuation of tumor growth was observed for both VEGI-251 and sVEGI, but not for full<br>
length VEGI-174. C. VEGI-251 and sVEGI transfection result in reduced microvessel densities in<br>
MB231 xenograft tumors. Paraffin sections (5um) from tumors were taken from mice described<br>

231 cells transfected with an empty vector (lane 1) or VEGI-251 cDNA (lane 2). The conditioned<br>
media is subjected to a gel-filtration chromatography and fractions with a molecular weight<br>
range of 10 - 50 kD were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Panel A: Coomassie blue<br>
staining of the gel. Panel B: Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody (13-2D) to VEGI.<br>
Figure 15. Graph showing inhibition of the growth of xenograft tumors formed by MDA-MB-<br>
231 cells transfected with VEGI-174, VEGI-251, IL6/VEGI, or an empty pCDNA-3 vector. One<br>
million stably transfected cells are injected into the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude<br>
mice. There are 2 injection sites per animal and 5 animal per group. The groups are coded and<br>
the sizes of the xenograft tumors are monitored in a blinded manner. Statistically significant<br>
inhibition of the growth of the tumors are observed for the VEGI-251 or the IL6-VEGI<br>
overexpressing cells. VEGI-174 overexpression has no effect on the tumor growth.<br>
Figure 16. Immunohistochernical analysis of the tumor samples obtained from the experiments<br>
described in Figure 7, using mAb 13-2D against human VEGI. VEGI-overexpressing cells are<br>
stained brown. Panels on the left are photographs of sections of tumor formed by the VEGI-251<br>
transfected cells. Levels of VEGI-251 production were apparently highly variable, as evident from<br>
the intensive staining of some of the tumor sections (G9-1R), which suggests high levels of<br>
VEGI production, versus markedly less staining of some tumors of the same group (G9-2R).<br>
Panels on the right are photographs of sections of tumors formed by vector-control cells. Brown-<br>
staining in the control tumor sections are likely to be the results of antibody cross-reaction to the<br>
intrinsic VEGI molecules on the mouse endothelium.<br>
Figure 17. Graph showing the growth rate of the tumors formed by the VEGI-251 transfected<br>
MDA-MB-231 cancer cells vary in accordance to the amount of VEGI produced by the cancer<br>
cells. Tumors in which VEGI level is higher (G9-1R) grow much more slowly than those with<br>
low VEGI levels (G9-2R).<br>

cancer cells. The number of cells is plotted against VEGI concentration as indicated. Inhibition<br>
of the growth of ABAE cells (closed circles) but not that of MDA-MB-231 (open circles) or<br>
MDA-MB-435 (triangles) cells, is shown. Cancer cells and ABAE cells are seeded at 2000 and<br>
8000 cells/well, respectively, in triplicate in 24-well plates. The culture media contained IMEM<br>
(Gibco) and 10% FCS. FGF-2 (1 ng/ml) is added to the media for ABAE cells. The cultures<br>
were maintained at 37Â°C, 5% CO2, for 6 days. The cells are then trypsinized, and the number of<br>
cells determined by using a Coulter counter. One fifth of the total number of recovered ABAE<br>
cells is shown in order to normalize the comparison with the cancer cells.<br>
Figure 20. Expression of VEGI in proliferating or quiescent endothelial cells. The VEGI<br>
mRNA levels in cultured HUVE cells are determined by Northern blotting analysis. Identical<br>
amount of total RNA (15 Âµg) is loaded on each lane, as indicated by the intensity of Ã-actin.<br>
Total RNA is prepared at the indicated time point (days post-seeding). The number of cells in<br>
each culture flask is determined simultaneously. The experiment is carried out in duplicate.<br>
Cells were seeded at 125,000 cells per flask (T-25) in IMEM, 10% FCS, 6 ng/ml FGF-2, and<br>
cultured at 37Â°C, 5% CO2.<br>
Figure 21. Graph showing the effect of VEGI on the ability of ABAE cells to form<br>
capillary-like tubes on collagen gels. The ability of the recombinant VEGI to inhibit the<br>
formation of capillary-like tubes by ABAE cells is shown. The p-values (t-test) given above the<br>
columns is obtained by comparing the extent of the capillary-like tube formation by ABAE cells<br>
in the presence of various concentrations of VEGI, as indicated, to that when VEGI is absent<br>
from the culture media.<br>
Figure 22. Graph showing the inhibition of angiogenesis in collagen gels placed on chick<br>
embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) by VEGI. Growth of new capillary vessels into<br>
collagen gel pellets (0.05 ml) placed on the CAM is induced by either FGF-2 (100 ng) or VEGF<br>
(250 ng), embedded in the gels. The extent of angiogenesis in the gels is determined by<br>
evaluation of the fluorescence intensity of FTIC-dextran injected into the CAM circulation and<br>
retained in the gel. Inhibition of the capillary vessel growth by VEGI, indicated by a value lower<br>
than 100, is shown. The inhibitor is also embedded in the gels. Error bars represent the standard<br>
deviation of triplicate experimental values.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel isoforms of VEGI polynucleotides and<br>
polypeptides, which inhibit vascular endothelial cell growth and methods for the treatment of<br>
diseases and processes that are mediated by or associated with angiogenesis via administering<br>
these polynucleotides, polypeptides, and other agents. The VEGI polynucleotides or<br>
polypeptides of the invention can be isolated from body fluids including, but not limited to,<br>
serum, urine, and ascites, or synthesized by chemical or biological methods (for example, cell<br>
culture, recombinant gene expression).<br>
Recombinant techniques include gene amplification from DNA sources using the<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and gene amplification from RNA sources using reverse<br>
transcriptase/PCR. These methods are well known in the art. VEGI inhibits the growth of blood<br>
vessels into tissues such as unvascularized or vascularized tumors. The present invention<br>
includes a protein that has a molecular weight of approximately 22 kD and any modified form of<br>
the protein, including, but not limited to, a truncation or a post-translational modification such as<br>
a glycosylated form of the protein that is capable of overcoming the angiogenic activity of<br>
endogenous growth factors.<br>
Definitions<br>
As described herein, a "mutant" or "variant" VEGI polynucleotide or polypeptide is a<br>
polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence that comprises one or more deletions, addition,<br>
transversion, or alteration in nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. As described further herein, a<br>
mutant VEGI sequence may result in a truncated or altered VEGI polynucleotide or polypeptide,<br>
increased or decreased expression of a VEGI polynucleotide or polypeptide, or any combination<br>
thereof. The mutation may be in coding, non-coding, 5' or 3' flanking, genomic or coding<br>
nucleotides.<br>
A "functionally preserved" variant of a VEGI isoform (i.e. VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, or<br>
VEGI-251) polynucleotide or VEGI isoform polypeptide is a VEGI sequence which retains at<br>
least one aspect of VEGI isoform function. Functionally preserved variants can be due to<br>
differences in linear sequence, arising from, for example, single base mutation(s), addition(s),<br>
deletion(s), and/or modifications) of the bases. The difference can also arise from changes in<br>
the sugar(s) and/or linkage(s) between the bases. Regarding polypeptides, functionally preserved<br>
variants may arise, for example, by conservative and/or non-conservative amino acid<br>
substitutions, amino acid analogs, and deletions. The function that is preserved depends upon<br>
the relevant function being considered. For example, if a VEGI isoform polynucleotide is<br>
considered for a probe, then the ability of a variant polynucleotide sequence to hybridize to the<br>
target is the relevant function. If a polynucleotide is considered for its ability to encode a VEGI<br>
isoform polypeptide (or fragment thereof), then the ability of a variant sequence to encode the<br>
same polypeptide is the relevant function. If a VEGI isoform polypeptide is considered for its<br>
ability to bind to a particular entity (such as an antibody or another protein), then the ability of a<br>
variant sequence to encode a polypeptide with equivalent binding characteristics that is relevant.<br>
A VEGI isoform polypeptide may be considered for its biological activity of the encoded gene<br>
product (e.g., a biological activity ascribed to a gene product corresponded to the VEGI isoform<br>
polynucleotides as a result of the assignment of the gene product to a protein family(ies) and/or<br>
identification of a functional domain present in the gene product). By a polypeptide<br>
demonstrating "functional activity" is meant, a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more<br>
known functional activities associated with a complete or mature VEGI isoform polypeptide.<br>
Such functional activities include, but are not limited to, biological activity (for example,<br>
inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation, induction of cell<br>
adhesion, antigenicity (ability, to bind or compete with one or more VEGI isoform polypeptide<br>
for binding to an anti-VEGI isoform antibody), immunogenicity (ability to generate antibody<br>
which binds to one or more VEGI isoform polypeptides), the ability to form polymers with other<br>
VEGI polypeptides. and ability to bind to a receptor or ligand for a VEGI polypeptide (for<br>
example, DIG).<br>
As used herein, "expression" includes transcription and/or translation.<br>
"Heterologous" means derived from (i.e., obtained from) a genotypically distinct entity<br>
from the rest of the entity to which it is being compared. For example, a polynucleotide may be<br>
placed by genetic engineering techniques into a plasmid or vector derived from a different<br>
source, thus becoming a heterologous polynucleotide. A promoter which is linked to a coding<br>
sequence with which it is not naturally linked is a heterologous promoter.<br>
A "reagent" polynucleotide, polypeptide, or antibody, is a substance provided for a<br>
reaction, the substance having some known and desirable parameters for the reaction. A reaction<br>
mixture may also contain a "target", such as a polynucleotide, antibody, polypeptide, or<br>
assembly of polypeptides that the reagent is capable of reacting with. For example, in some<br>
types of diagnostic tests, the presence and/or amount of the target in a sample is determined by<br>
adding a reagent, allowing the reagent and target to react, and measuring the amount of reaction<br>
product (if any). In the context of clinical management, a "target" may also be a cell, collection<br>
of cells, tissue, or organ that is the object of an administered substance, such as a pharmaceutical<br>
compound.<br>
A "stable duplex" of polynucleotides, or a "stable complex" formed between any two or<br>
more components in a biochemical reaction, refers to a duplex or complex that is sufficiently<br>
long-lasting to persist between formation of the duplex or complex and subsequent detection,<br>
including any optional washing steps or other manipulation that may take place in the interim.<br>
A gene or polynucleotide is "differentially expressed" in a test sample when the<br>
polynucleotide is detected at a higher or lower level compared with a control sample of the same<br>
type. Typically, a differentially expressed polynucleotide includes polynucleotides that are<br>
expressed such that, for example, mRNA is found at levels at least about 25%, at least about 50%<br>
to 75%, at least about 90%, at least about 2-fold, at least about 4-fold, at least about 5-fold, and<br>
at least about 10-fold or more, higher (e.g. overexpressed) or lower (e.g., underexpressed). The<br>
comparison can be made between two tissue, for example, if one is using in situ hybridization or<br>
another assay method that allows some degree of discrimination among cell types in the tissue.<br>
The comparison may also be made between cells removed from their tissue source.<br>
An "effective amount" of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount<br>
sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results including clinical results such as inhibiting<br>
vascular endothelial cell growth, inhibiting angiogenesis, promoting angiogenesis, shrinking the<br>
size of the tumor, retardation of cancerous cell growth, decreasing one or more symptoms<br>
resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease,<br>
decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of<br>
another medication, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of<br>
patients, either directly or indirectly. An effective amount can be administered in one or more<br>
administrations. As is understood in the angiogenesis-associated disease clinical context, an<br>
effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be<br>
achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an<br>
"effective amount" may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic<br>
agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in<br>
conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.<br>
As used herein, "treatment" or "treating" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or<br>
desired results including and preferably clinical results. For purposes of this invention,<br>
beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:<br>
reducing the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, inhibiting angiogenesis, promoting<br>
angiogenesis, reducing the size of the tumor, decreasing symptoms resulting from the disease,<br>
increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other<br>
medications required to treat the disease, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or<br>
prolonging survival of patients.<br>
"Development" or "progression" of angiogenesis-associated disease herein means initial<br>
manifestations and/or ensuing progression of the disorder. Development of angiogenesis-<br>
associated disease can be detectable and assessed using standard clinical techniques. However,<br>
development also refers to disease progression that may be undetectable. For purposes of this<br>
invention, development or progression refers to the biological course of the disease state.<br>
"Development" includes occurrence, recurrence, and onset. As used herein "onset" or<br>
"occurrence" of angiogenesis-associated disease includes initial onset and/or recurrence.<br>
As used herein, "delaying development" of angiogenesis-associated disease means to<br>
defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease. This delay can<br>
be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disorder and/or the medical profile<br>
of the individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant<br>
delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop detectable<br>
disease. A method that "delays" development of disease is a method that reduces the extent of<br>
the disease in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons<br>
are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects,<br>
although this knowledge can be based upon anecdotal evidence. "Delaying development" can<br>
mean that the extent and/or undesirable clinical manifestations are lessened and/or time course of<br>
the progression is slowed or lengthened, as compared to not administering the agent. Thus the<br>
term also includes, but is not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of<br>
disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression,<br>
and remission (whether partial or total) whether detectable or undetectable.<br>
As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "and", and "the"<br>
include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,<br>
reference to "a polynucleotide" includes a plurality of such polynucleotides and reference to "the<br>
agent" includes reference to one or more agents and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in<br>
the art, and so forth.<br>

Referring to the sequence alignment comparing the deduced amino acid sequences for<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 4, 5, and 6 (Table 7), the C-terminal region of the polypeptides encoded by these<br>
SEQ ID's is identical from Val-24 of VEGI-174 to the C-terminus of the protein. However, the<br>
N-termini of the four isoforms are different. It is shown in the Examples that VEGI-174 does not<br>
inhibit angiogenesis because it is not efficiently exported from the cell upon expression. In<br>
contrast, VEGI-251 is efficiently trafficked to the extracellular medium upon expression, and is<br>
thereby effective, at inhibiting angiogenesis. Export of VEGI-251 results in cleavage of the<br>
presequence; the location for proteolysis is believed to be at position 61 or 96 of VEGI-2si;but<br>
may also be located at another site located approximately between Glu-20 and Ser-57 of VEGI-<br>
251. Possible sites include, but are not limited to, E64, K73, E77, S81, R90, and K95. Purified<br>
VEGI-192a polypeptides is also effective at inhibiting vascular endothelial cell growth.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising<br>
sequences corresponding to novel isoforms of VEGI shown in Table 1,2, and 3 (SEQ ID NO:1,<br>
SEQ ID NO:2, and SEQ ID NO:3). The polynucleotides of this invention, including fragments<br>
of polynucleotides of this invention, are useful as probes, primers, in expression systems<br>
(including in vivo and in vitro expression systems, as described herein, which may also be a<br>
basis of gene therapy), and in screening systems. Especially useful applications of the<br>
polynucleotides will be discussed below.<br>
By "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or RNA,<br>
that has been removed from its native environment. In some embodiments, at least 50%,<br>
preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, and even more preferably at least 90% free<br>
of the materials with which it is associated in nature have been removed. For example,<br>
recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the<br>
present invention. Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA<br>
molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) DNA<br>
molecules in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the<br>
DNA molecules of the present invention. Isolated nucleic acid molecules further includes such<br>
molecules produced synthetically. Accordingly, an "isolated" polynucleotide or polypeptide also<br>
refers to recombinant or other non-naturally occurring forms polynucleotides or polypeptides,<br>
which, by virtue of origin or manipulation: (1) are not associated with all or a portion of a<br>
polynucleotide or polypeptide with which it is associated in nature, (2) are linked to a<br>
polynucleotide or polypeptide other than that to which it is linked in nature, or (3) does not occur<br>
in nature, or (4) in the case of polypeptides arise from expression of recombinant<br>
polynucleotides.<br>
The present invention also provides nucleic acid molecules (including, as is well<br>
understood by one in the art and described herein, isolated and/or recombinant forms) encoding a<br>
mature form of the polypeptide proteins described herein. The amino acid sequence of the<br>
complete VEGI isoform polypeptide includes a leader sequence and a mature protein. According<br>
to the signal hypothesis, once export of the growing protein chain across the rough endoplasmic<br>
reticulum has been initiated, proteins secreted by mammalian cells have a signal or secretory<br>
leader sequence which is cleaved from the complete polypeptide to produce a secreted "mature"<br>
form of the protein. Most mammalian cells and even insect cells cleave secreted proteins with the<br>
same specificity. However, in some cases, cleavage of a secreted protein is not entirely uniform,<br>
which results in two or more mature species of the protein. Further, it has long been known that<br>
the cleavage specificity of a secreted protein is ultimately determined by the primary structure of<br>
the complete protein, that is, it is inherent in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide.<br>
The present invention also provides polynucleotides encoding a fusion protein. As is<br>
well known in the art, a fusion protein or polypeptide is a polypeptide comprising regions in a<br>
different position than occurs in nature. The regions may normally exist in separate proteins and<br>
are brought together in the fusion polypeptide, or they may normally exist in the same protein<br>
but are placed in a new arrangement in the fusion polypeptide. Accordingly, the invention<br>
provides polynucleotides, wherein the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide may be fused<br>
in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide sequence which aids in expression and secretion of<br>
a polypeptide from a host cell, for example, a leader sequence which functions as a secretory<br>
sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell. The polypeptide having a<br>
leader sequence is a preprotein and may have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to<br>
form the mature form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides may also encode for a proprotein<br>
which is the mature protein plus additional 5' amino acid residues. A mature protein having a<br>
prosequence is a proprotein and is an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is<br>
cleaved an active mature protein remains. Thus, for example, the polynucleotide of the present<br>
invention may encode for a mature protein, or for a protein having a prosequence and a<br>
presequence (leader sequence).<br>
The polynucleotides of the present invention provides coding sequence fused in frame to<br>
a marker sequence allows for purification or detection of the polypeptide of the present<br>
invention. The marker sequence may be a hexa-histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to<br>
provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial<br>
host, or, for example, the marker sequence may be a hemagglutinin (HA) tag when a mammalian<br>
host, e.g., COS-7 cells, is used. The HA tag, corresponds to an epitope derived from the<br>
influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson. I., et al., Cell, 37:767 (1984)).<br>
. Thus, the term "polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide" encompasses a polynucleotide<br>
which includes only coding sequence for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide which<br>
includes additional coding and/or non-coding sequence. For purposes of this invention, and to<br>
avoid cumbersome referrals to complementary strands, the anti-sense (or complementary) strand<br>
of such a polynucleotide is also said to encode the sequence; that is, a polynucleotide sequence<br>
that "encodes" a polypeptide includes both the conventional coding strand and the<br>
complementary sequence (or strand).<br>
A mutant or a variant of the polynucleotide may be a naturally occurring allelic variant of<br>
the polynucleotide or a non-naturally occurring variant of the polynucleotide. Such nucleotide<br>
mutants or variants include deletion variants, substitution variants and addition or insertion<br>
variants. A variant sequence may result in a truncated or altered polynucleotide or polypeptide,<br>
increased or decreased expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide, or any combination<br>
thereof. The variant may be in coding, non-coding, 5' or 3' flanking, genomic or coding<br>
nucleotides.<br>
In some embodiments, the polynucleotide sequence comprises a sequence different from<br>
those shown Tables 1,2, or 3 (SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, and SEQ ID NO:3) due to the<br>
degeneracy of the genetic code. Genetic code is well known in the art. It would be routine for<br>
one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate variants. Accordingly, in some embodiments,<br>
the present invention provides a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ<br>
ID NO:5,or SEQ ID NO:6.<br>
The present invention is further provides fragments or truncated form of the isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated nucleic acid molecule<br>
having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide sequences herein, or the complementary strand<br>
thereto, is intended fragments at least 5 nt, at least 10 nt, at least 15 nt, at least 20 nt, at least 30<br>
nt, at least 40,50,100,150,200,250,300,400, or 500 nt in length (contiguous nucleotides).<br>
These fragments have numerous uses which include, but are not limited to, diagnostic probes and<br>
primers as discussed herein. As is well understood in the art, generally a probe is used for<br>
detection on a target by hybridization. In some embodiments, a probe may comprise a label or a<br>
means by which a label can be attached, either before or subsequent to the hybridization reaction.<br>
Suitable labels include, but are not limited to radioisotopes, fluorochromes, chemiluminescent<br>
compounds, dyes, and enzymes. Further, those skilled in the art understand that a primer is<br>
generally extended by polymerization after hybridizing to a target sequence. Of course, larger<br>
fragments 50-1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention. By a fragment<br>
at least 20 nt in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous<br>
bases from the nucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, these fragments comprises<br>
nucleotides 93 and 94 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or nucleotides 386 and<br>
387 of the sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2). Alternatively, fragments may be less<br>
than 1500, 1250, 1000, 750, 500,250,200,150,100, 50, 40 nt in length and comprise<br>
nucleotides 93 and 94 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or nucleotides 386 and<br>
387 of the sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2).<br>
The present invention also provides polynucleotides comprising the sequence of VEGI-<br>
192a (nucleotides 1 to 93 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1)), or VEGI-192b<br>

SEQ ID NO:2, said contiguous nucleotides comprise nucleotides 386 and 387 of SEQ ID NO:2.<br>

acid residues 5-192,10-192,15-192,25-192 of the sequence shown in Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5).<br>
It is understood that, a region of contiguous amino acids or nucleotides that are within a<br>
given pair of amino acids or nucleotides can, but not necessarily, include either member of the<br>
specified pair. For example, contiguous nucleotides within nucleotides 1-93 of SEQ ID NO:1<br>
can include nucleotide 1 and/or nucleotide 93 of SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention excludes polynucleotides encoding a<br>
polypeptide consisting of amino acids 27-192 of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5 or any truncated<br>
form of such polynucleotides.<br>
The invention also provides polynucleotides comprising the sequence encoding any of<br>
VEGI polypeptides described herein.<br>
In specific embodiments, the polynucleotide fragments of the invention encode a<br>
polypeptide which demonstrates a functional activity. By a polypeptide demonstrating<br>
"functional activity" is meant, a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional<br>
activities associated with a complete or mature VEGI polypeptide. Such functional activities<br>
include, but are not limited to, biological activity (for example, inhibition of angiogenesis,<br>
inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation, induction of cell adhesion, antigenicity<br>
(ability, to bind or compete with a VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide for binding to an<br>
anti-VEGI-192a and/or ami-VEGI-192b antibody), immunogenicity (ability to generate antibody<br>
which binds to a VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide), the ability to form polymers with<br>
other VEGI polypeptides. and ability to bind to a receptor or ligand for a VEGI polypeptide (for<br>
example, DR3).<br>
Similarly, the VEGI polypeptides encoded by any of the polynucleotides described herein<br>
may have one or more functional activities of VEGI as described above and herein.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides an isolated polynucleotide having at least<br>
85%, at least 88%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94%, at least 96 %, at least 98%, or at least<br>
99% sequence identity with the polynucleotides of the invention as described herein. One<br>
embodiment provides an isolated polynucleotide having at least 85%, at least 88%, at least 90%,<br>
at least 92%, at least 94%, at least 96 %, at least 98%, or at least 99% sequence identity with the<br>
VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b sequence shown in Table 1 or Table 2 (SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:2).<br>
In other embodiments, isolated polynucleotides additionally have less than 85%, 83%, 80%,<br>
75%, 70 % sequence identity with the above VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b sequence. The invention<br>
also includes isolated polynucleotides having at least 85%, at least 88%, at least 90%, at least<br>
92%, at least 94%, at least 96 %, at least 98%, or at least 99% sequence identity to fragments of<br>
at least 10 contiguous nucleotides (or more, such as 15,18,20,25,35,40,45, 50,60,75, or 100<br>
contiguous nucleotides) of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or 2 (SEQ ID NO:2),<br>
wherein the contiguous nucleotides comprise nucleotides 93 and 94 of SEQ ID NO:1, or<br>
nucleotides 386 and 387 of SEQ ID NO:2. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides having at<br>
least 85%, at least 88%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94%, at least 96 %, at least 98%, or at<br>
least 99% sequence identity to fragments of at least 10 contiguous nucleotides (or more, such as<br>
15,18,20,25, 35,40,45, 50, 60,75, or 100 contiguous nucleotides) of the sequence shown in<br>
Table 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) or of the sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2), wherein the<br>
contiguous nucleotides are within nucleotides 1-93 of SEQ ID NO:1 or nucleotides 1-386 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
A polynucleotide or polynucleotide region has a certain percentage (for example, 80%,<br>
85%, 90%, or 95%) of "sequence identity" to another sequence means that, when aligned, that<br>
percentage of bases are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the<br>
percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the<br>
art, for example those described in Current Protocols in Molecule Biology (F.M. Ausubel et al,<br>
eds., 1987) Supplement 30, section 7.718, Table 4.7.1. Percent identity can be determined<br>
electronically, e.g., by using the MegAlign.TM. program (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison Wiss.). Th
MegAlign.TM. program can create alignments between two or more sequences according to<br>
different methods, e.g., the clustal method. (See, e.g., Higgins, D. G. and P. M. Sharp (1988)<br>
Gene 73:237-244.) The clustal algorithm groups sequences into clusters by examining the<br>
distances between all pairs. The clusters are aligned pairwise and then in groups. The<br>
percentage similarity between two amino acid sequences, e.g., sequence A and sequence B, is<br>
calculated by dividing the length of sequence A, minus the number of gap residues in sequence<br>
A, minus the number of gap residues in sequence B, into the sum of the residue matches between<br>
sequence A and sequence B, times one hundred. Gaps of low or of no similarity between the tw
amino acid sequences are not included in determining percentage similarity. Percent identity<br>
between nucleic acid sequences can also be counted or calculated by other methods known in the<br>
art, e.g., the Jotun Hein method. (See, e.g., Hein, J. (1990) Methods Enzymol. 183:626-645.)<br>
The invention also provides an isolated nucleic acid that hybridizes under high stringenc)<br>
conditions to a nucleic acid having a sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence<br>
selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:1, and SEQ ID NO:2, or to the nucleic acid<br>
having a sequence complementary to a nucleotide encoding polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 or<br>
SEQ ID NO:5, or their complement thereof.<br>
hi terms of hybridization conditions, the higher the sequence identity required, the more<br>
stringent are the hybridization conditions if such sequences are determined by their ability to<br>
hybridize to a polynucleotide sequence of the invention. Accordingly, the invention also<br>
includes polynucleotides that are able to hybridize to a sequence comprising a polynucleotide of<br>
the invention as discussed herein. An example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight<br>
incubation at 42Â°C in a solution: 50% formamide, 1xSSC (150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM<br>
sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5 X denhardt's solution, 10% dextran<br>
sulfate, and 20 Âµg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in<br>
0.1 x SSC at about 65Â°C. For discussion regarding hybridization reactions, see below.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated polynucleotide comprising a<br>
sequence of at least 10 contiguous nucleotides (or more, such as 15,18,20,25,35,40,45, 50,<br>
60, 75, or 100 (or more) contiguous nucleotides) that hybridizes with a polynucleotide (such as<br>
DNA or RNA) comprising the sequence depicted in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or Table 2 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:2), or fragments thereof, as described above, under conditions where it does not hybridize<br>
with other polynucleotides from a mammalian cell, preferably a human cell, or under conditions<br>
in which hybridization to the polynucleotide having the sequence depicted in Table 1 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:1) or Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2) is enriched relative to hybridization with other polynucleotides<br>
from a mammalian cell. In some embodiments, the fragments comprise nucleotides 93 and 94 of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 or nucleotides 386 and 387 of SEQ ID NO:2. In some embodiments, the<br>
fragments are within nucleotides 1-93 of SEQ ID NO:1 or nucleotides 1-386 of SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
These embodiments are particularly useful in the diagnostic (detection) context.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention includes a polynucleotide sequence comprising at<br>
least 10, preferably 15, preferably 18, preferably 20, more preferably 25, more preferably 35,<br>
more preferably 50, still more preferably 75,100,125,150,200,250 contiguous nucleotides of<br>
the non-coding (i.e., flanking) shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2).<br>
These embodiments may be particularly useful as diagnostic probes, or as primers for<br>
amplification of noncoding portions of the VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b gene.<br>
It is understood that (unless otherwise specified or required), any embodiment of the<br>
invention described herein that is a polynucleotide encompasses both the double-stranded form<br>
and each of two complementary single-stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double<br>
stranded form.<br>
Hybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different "stringency".<br>
Conditions that increase stringency of a hybridization reaction of widely known and published in<br>
the art. See, for example, Sambrook et al. (1989). Examples of relevant conditions include (in<br>
order of increasing stringency): incubation temperatures of 25Â°C, 37Â°C, 50Â°C and 68Â°C; buffer<br>
concentrations of 10 X SSC, 6 X SSC, 1 X SSC, 0.1 X SSC (where SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 15<br>
mM citrate buffer) and their equivalents using other buffer systems; formamide concentrations of<br>
0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%; incubation times from 5 minutes to 24 hours; 1,2, or more washing<br>
steps; wash incubation times of 1,2, or 15 minutes; and wash solutions of 6 X SSC, 1 X SSC,<br>
0.1 X SSC, or deionized water. An example of stringent hybridization conditions is<br>
hybridization at 50Â°C or higher and O.lxSSC (15 mM sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate).<br>
Another example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight incubation at 42Â°C in a<br>
solution: 50% formamide, lxSSC (150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate), 50 mM<br>
sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5 X denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 ug/ml<br>
denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1 x SSC at about<br>
65Â°C. Stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization conditions that are at least as<br>
stringent as the above representative conditions. Other stringent hybridization conditions are<br>
known in the art and may also be employed to identify nucleic acids of this particular<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The invention also provides primers and probes comprising a region of SEQ ID NO:1 or<br>
SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the region is within nucleotides 1-93 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or nucleotides 1-<br>
386 of SEQ ID NO:2. The invention also provides primers and probes comprising a region of<br>
SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the region comprises nucleotides 93 and 94 of SEQ ID<br>
NO:1 or nucleotides 386 and 387 of SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
Probes from more than one polynucleotide sequence provided herein can hybridize with<br>
the same nucleic acid if the cDNA from which they were derived corresponds to one mRNA. By<br>
using probes, particularly labeled probes of DNA sequences, one can isolate homologous or<br>
related genes. The source of homologous genes can be any species, e.g. primate species,<br>
canines, felines, bovines, ovines, equines, yeast, nematodes. Probes of more than 10 nucleotides<br>
("nt") can be used, e.g. probes of a size within a range of about 15 nt, 18 nt, 20, nt, 25nt, 75 nt, or<br>
100 nt, but in general about 15 nt represents sufficient sequence for unique identification.<br>
"Tm" is the temperature in degrees Centigrade at which 50% of a polynucleotide duplex<br>
made of complementary strands hydrogen bonded in anti-parallel direction by Watson-Crick<br>
base pairing dissociates into single strands under conditions of the experiment. Tm may be<br>
predicted according to a standard formula, such as:<br>
Tm = 81.5 + 16.6 log[X+] + 0.41 (%G/C) - 0.61 (%F) - 600/L<br>
where [X+] is the cation concentration (usually sodium ion, Na+) in mol/L; (%G/C) is the<br>
number of G and C residues as a percentage of total residues in the duplex; (%F) is the percent<br>
formamide in solution (wt/vol); and L is the number of nucleotides in each strand of the duplex.<br>
As described above, the invention includes variants or modifications to the VEGl-192a and<br>
VEGI-192b polynucleotides such as deletions, substitutions, additions, or changes in the nature of<br>
any nucleic acid moieties. A variant or modification is any difference in nucleotide sequence as<br>
compared to a polynucleotide shown herein to encode a VEGI-192a or a VEGI-192b polypeptide,<br>
and/or any difference in terms of the nucleic acid moieties of the polynucleotide(s). Such<br>
changes can be useful to facilitate cloning and modifying expression of VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b<br>
polynucleotides. Such changes also can be useful for conferring desirable properties to the<br>
polynucleotide(s), such as stability. The definition of polynucleotide provided herein gives<br>
examples of these modifications. Hence, the invention also includes functionally-preserved<br>
variants of the nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein, which include nucleic acid substitutions,<br>
additions, and/or deletions. Variants include naturally occurring variants of the polynucleotide<br>
sequence (e.g. degenerate variants, allelic variants, etc. In general, allelic variants contain 15-<br>
25% base pair (bp) mismatches and can contain as little as 5-15%, or 2-5%, or 1-2% bp<br>
mismatch, as well as a single bp mismatch.<br>
As described above, the invention encompasses VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b polynucleotides<br>
including full-length (unprocessed), processed, coding, non-coding or portions thereof. A partial<br>
map of the VEGI-192a genomic region is shown in Figure 6, including predicted intron-exon<br>
boundaries. The invention can further include the 3' and 5' untranslated regions found in the<br>
mature mRNA, specific transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences, such as<br>
promoters, enhancers, etc., including about 1 kb, and possibly more of flanking genomic DNA at<br>
either the 5' or 3' end of the transcribed region. The genomic DNA can be isolated as a fragment<br>
of 100 kbp or smaller, and substantially free of flanking chromosomal sequence. The genomic<br>
DNA flanking the coding region, either 3' or 5', or internal regulatory sequences as sometime<br>
found in introns, contains sequences required for proper tissue, stage-specific or disease-state<br>
specific expression. Also embodied are the mRNA and cDNA sequences and fragments thereof,<br>
including fragments that include a portion of a VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b encoding segment.<br>
Normally, mRNA species have contiguous exons, with the intervening introns, when present,<br>
being removed by nuclear RNA splicing, to create a continuous open reading frame encoding a<br>
polypeptide. mRNA species can also exist with both exons and introns, where the introns may<br>
be removed by alternative splicing. Furthermore, different species of mRNAs encoded by the<br>
same genomic species can exist at varying levels in a cell, and detection of these various levels<br>
of mRNA species can be indicative of differential expression of the encoded gene product in the<br>
cell.<br>
The invention also encompasses polynucleotides encoding for functionally equivalent<br>
variants and derivatives of full-length VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b and functionally equivalent<br>
fragments (such as deletion of amino acids from N-terminal and/or from C-terminal of VEGI-<br>
192a, or VEGI-192b) thereof which may enhance, decrease or not significantly affect properties of<br>
the polypeptides encoded thereby. For instance, changes in a DNA sequence that do not change<br>
the encoded amino acid sequence, as well as those that result in conservative substitutions of<br>
amino acid residues, non-deleterious non-conservative substitutions, one or a few amino acid<br>
deletions or additions, and substitution of amino acid residues by amino acid analogs are those<br>
which will not significantly affect properties of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide<br>
substitutions that do not alter the amino acid residues encoded can be useful for optimizing gene<br>
expression in different systems. Suitable substitutions are known to those of skill in the art and<br>
are made, for instance, to reflect preferred codon usage in the particular expression systems. In<br>
another example, alternatively spliced polynucleotides can give rise to a functionally equivalent<br>
fragment or variant of VEGI. Alternatively processed polynucleotide sequence variants are<br>
defined as polynucleotide sequences corresponding to mRNAs that differ in sequence for one<br>
another but are derived from the same genomic region, for example, mRNAs that result from: 1)<br>
the use of alternative promoters; 2) the use of alternative polyadenylation sites; or 3) the use of<br>
alternative splice sites.<br>
This invention also provides a DNA insert comprising a nucleic acid having a nucleotide<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a complement thereof. In other embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a DNA insert comprising a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2<br>
or a complement thereof.<br>
As well understood in the art, a "polynucleotide" refers to a polymeric form of<br>
nucleotides of any length, which contain deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or their<br>
analogs. The terms "polynucleotide" and "nucleic acid" as used herein are used interchangeably,<br>
and as is well known in the art. Polynucleotides may have any three-dimensional structure. The<br>
term "polynucleotide" includes double-, single-stranded, and triple-helical molecules. Unless<br>
otherwise specified or required, any embodiment of the invention described herein that is a<br>
polynucleotide encompasses both the double-stranded form and each of two complementary<br>
single-stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double stranded form. Not all linkages<br>
in a polynucleotide need be identical.<br>
In some embodiments, a polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as<br>
methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. The use of uracil as a substitute for thymine in a<br>
deoxyribonucleic acid is also considered an analogous form of pyrimidine.<br>
As is widely known in the art, if present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be<br>
imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. In some embodiments, the sequence of<br>
nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. As described herein, a<br>
polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a<br>
labeling component. Other types of modifications are, for example, "caps", substitution of one<br>
or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such<br>
as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters,<br>
phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates,<br>
phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins<br>
(e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ploy-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators<br>
(e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron,<br>
oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha<br>
anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). All of these<br>
modifications are well known in the art.<br>
Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced by<br>
phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to<br>
prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports.<br>
The 5' and 3' terminal OH groups can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic<br>
capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized<br>
to standard protecting groups.<br>
Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are<br>
generally known in the art, including, but not limited to, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fiuoro- or<br>
2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, a-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as<br>
arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs<br>
and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside.<br>
Although conventional sugars and bases are generally used, substitution of analogous<br>
forms of sugars, purines and pyrimidines can be advantageous in designing a final product, as<br>
can alternative backbone structures like a polyamide backbone or phosphorothioate backbone.<br>
This invention encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions,<br>
comprising polynucleotides described herein. These compositions may further comprise suitable<br>
excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well<br>
known in the art.<br>
This invention also provides kits comprising any of the polynucleotides described herein.<br>
In some embodiments, the kits comprise polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
In some embodiments, the kits comprise polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide of SEQ ID<br>
NO:4 and/or SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the kits comprise probes and primers<br>
comprising at least 15 contiguous, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, or at least 50 nucleotides of<br>
SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2, said contiguous nucleotides are within nucleotides 1-93 of SEQ<br>
ID NO:1 or nucleotides 1-386 SEQ ID NO:2. These kits may further include reagents and<br>
instructions for detecting the presence or absence or the level of expression of VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b- The kits of this invention are in suitable packaging, and may optionally provide<br>
additional components such as, buffers and instructions.<br>
This invention also provides polynucleotides described herein attached to a solid support.<br>
Methods of attaching polynucleotides to a solid support, for example surface of arrays, are well<br>
known in the art. The solid support is of any suitable material, including polystyrene based<br>
beads and glass chips, such as a GeneChip.RTM. product (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.).<br>
See International Publication Nos. WO 97/10365, WO 97/29212, WO 97/27317, WO 95/11995,<br>
WO 90/15070, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,744,305 and 5,445,934.<br>
This invention also provides arrays comprising VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b<br>
polynucleotides. Polynucleotide arrays provide a high throughput technique that can assay a<br>
large number of polynucleotides or polypeptides in a sample. This technology can be used as a<br>
tool to test for differential expression. A variety of methods of producing arrays, as well as<br>
variations of these methods, are known in the art and contemplated for use in the invention. For<br>
example, arrays can be created by spotting polynucleotide probes onto a substrate (e.g., glass,<br>
nitrocellulose, etc.) in a two-dimensional matrix or array having bound probes. The probes can<br>
be bound to the substrate by either covalent bonds or by non-specific interactions, such as<br>
hydrophobic interactions. Samples of polynucleotides can be detectably labeled (e.g., using<br>
radioactive or fluorescent labels) and then hybridized to the probes. Double stranded<br>
polynucleotides, comprising the labeled sample polynucleotides bound to probe polynucleotides,<br>
can be detected once the unbound portion of the sample is washed away. Alternatively, the<br>
polynucleotides of the test sample can be immobilized on the array, and the probes detectably<br>
labeled. Techniques for constructing arrays and methods of using these arrays are described in,<br>
for example, Schena et al. (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 93 (20): 10614-9; Schena et al.<br>
(1995) Science 270(5235):467-70; Shalon et al. (1996) Genome Res. 6(7):639-45, USPN<br>
5,807,522, EP 799 897; WO 97/29212; WO 97/27317; EP 785 280; WO 97/02357; USPN<br>
5,593,839; USPN 5,578,832; EP 728 520; USPN 5,599,695; EP 721 016; USPN 5,556,752; WO<br>
95/22058; and USPN 5,631,734.<br>
Arrays can be used to examine differential expression of genes and can be used to<br>
determine gene function. For example, arrays can be used to detect differential expression of a<br>
VEGI isoform corresponding to a polynucleotide described herein, where expression is<br>
compared between a test cell and control cell. For example, high expression of a particular<br>
VEGI isoform message in an cell from a subject who has a disease, which is not observed in a<br>
corresponding normal cell, can indicate an association of this VEGI isoform with such disease.<br>
Exemplary uses of arrays are further described in, for example, Pappalarado et al., Sem.<br>
Radiation Oncol. (1998) 8:217; and Ramsay Nature Biotechnol. (1998) 16:40. Furthermore,<br>
many variations on methods of detection using arrays are well within the skill in the art and<br>
within the scope of the present invention. For example, rather than immobilizing the probe to a<br>
solid support, the test sample can be immobilized on a solid support which is then contacted with<br>
the probe.<br>
A VEGI isoform polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cell from an<br>
individual having a disease would be of clinical significance with respect to this disease. A<br>
VEGI isoform polynucleotide is differentially expressed in a cell when the polynucleotide is<br>
detected at higher or lower levels in a cell of an individual having a disease compared to a cell of<br>
the same cell type that is from an individual who does not having the disease. Typically,<br>
screening for polynucleotides differentially expressed focuses on a polynucleotide that is<br>
expressed such that, for example, mRNA is found at levels at least about 25%, at least about 50%<br>
to about 75%, at least about 90%, at least about 2-fold, at least about 4-fold; at least about 5-fold,<br>
at least about 10-fold, or at least about 50-fold or more, higher (e.g. overexpressed) or lower<br>
(e.g., underexpressed) in a cell from an individual who has the disease when compared with a<br>
cell of the same cell type that is not from such an individual. The comparison can be made<br>
between two tissues, for example, if one is using in situ hybridization or another assay method<br>
that allows some degree of discrimination among cell types in the tissue. The comparison may<br>
also be made between cells removed from their tissue source.<br>
Thus, the invention provides an array comprising a VEGI isoform polynucleotides as<br>
described herein. In some embodiments, the invention provides an array comprising a<br>
polynucleotide sequence shown is Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), or a region of polynucleotide of the<br>
sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein said region is at least 10 contiguous<br>
nucleotides (or more, such as at least 15,18,20, 25,35,40,45, 50,60,75 or 100 contiguous<br>
nucleotides). In other embodiments, the region further comprises nucleotides 93 and 94 of the<br>
sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1). In other embodiments, the region is within<br>
nucleotides 1-93 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides an array comprising a polynucleotide<br>
sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2), or a region of polynucleotide of the sequence shown<br>
in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2), wherein said region is at least 10 contiguous nucleotides (or more,<br>
such as at least 15,18,20,25,35,40,45, 50,60,75 or 100 contiguous nucleotides). In other<br>
embodiments, the region further comprises nucleotides 386 and 387 of the sequence shown in<br>
Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2). In other embodiments, the region is within nucleotides 1-386 of the<br>
sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
Arrays are also useful for detecting mutant VEGI isoform polynucleotides. Mutant VEGI<br>
isoform polynucleotides can be detected in genomic DNA, e.g., genomic DNA isolated from the<br>
blood of an individual or from another tissue sample. Mutant VEGI isoform polynucleotides can<br>
also be detected using cDNA or mRNA from an individual possessing an altered VEGI isoform<br>
polynucleotide, if the mutant VEGI isoform polynucleotide results in an mRNA that is altered in<br>
size (for example). A mutant VEGI isoform gene may also result in the differential expression<br>
(increased or decreased) of a VEGI isoform mRNA, which can be detected as described herein.<br>
The present invention also provides an array comprising one or more isolated<br>
polynucleotides that specifically hybridize to the polynucleotide described herein. In some<br>
embodiments, the invention provides an array comprising one or more isolated polynucleotides<br>
that specifically hybridize to the polynucleotide shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), or a region of<br>
polynucleotide of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein said region is at least<br>
10 contiguous nucleotides (or more, such as at least 15,18,20,25,35,40,45, 50,60,75 or 100<br>
contiguous nucleotides). In other embodiments, the region further comprises nucleotides 93 and<br>
94 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1). In other embodiments, the region is within<br>
nucleotides 1-93 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
In other embodiments, the invention provides an array comprising one or more isolated<br>
polynucleotides that specifically hybridize to a polynucleotide sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ<br>
ID NO:2), or a region of polynucleotide of the sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO:2),<br>
wherein said region is at least 10 contiguous nucleotides (or more, such as at least 15,18,20,25,<br>
35,40,45, 50,60,75 or 100 contiguous nucleotides). In other embodiments, the region further<br>
comprises nucleotides 386 and 387 of the sequence shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NO.2). In other<br>
embodiments, the region is within nucleotides 1-386 of the sequence shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:1).<br>
Polypeptides of the invention<br>
The present invention encompasses human VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, and VEGI-251<br>
polypeptide sequences shown in Tables 4 (SEQ ID NO: 4), 5 (SEQ ID NO:5), and 6 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:6). The VEGI polypeptides can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by<br>
methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation., acid extraction, anion or cation<br>
exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction<br>
chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin<br>
chromatography. Protein refolding steps can be used as necessary in completing configuration of<br>
the mature protein. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed<br>
for final purification steps. Examples of protein refolding and purification methods are described<br>
in U.S. Pat. Appl. 20010044521 and WO 01/55174.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention may be a naturally purified product or a<br>
product of chemical synthetic procedures, or produced by recombinant techniques from a<br>
prokaryotic (such as E.coli) or eukaryotic host (such as CHO cells). Depending upon the host<br>
employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may<br>
be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. Polypeptides of the invention may also include an<br>
initial methionine amino acid residue.<br>
The VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, and VEGI-251 polypeptides of the invention (which, as described<br>
herein, include various embodiments, such as full-length, nurture, fusion, fragments, etc.) have a<br>
variety of uses, as described herein. The polypeptides are of particular interest as genetic or<br>
biochemical markers (e.g., in blood or tissues) that indicate angiogenesis related disease, and/or<br>
to monitor the efficacy of various therapies and preventative interventions. Diagnostic (i.e.,<br>
detection) and screening methods are described in more detail below. The polypeptides of the<br>
invention also are of use in making antibodies that bind to these polypeptides, their use as an<br>
agent to screen pharmaceutical candidates (both in vitro and in vivo), their use in rational (i.e.,<br>
structure-based) drug design, as well as other uses include therapeutic uses which are described<br>
herein (for example, if full-length VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b exerts its action by binding to another<br>
protein, a polypeptide that binds competitively to VEGI-192a or \HEGI-192b could compromise<br>
VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b function as a competitive inhibitor and thus exert therapeutic activity).<br>
The VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b polypeptides may also be used to identifying proteins especially<br>
those from humans that bind (or interact physically) with VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b which could<br>
thus themselves be drug targets.<br>
The invention provides polypeptide, truncated forms, or fragments, of VEGI-192a and<br>
VEGI-192b. The VEGI polypeptides of the invention have one or more functions, as described in<br>
the previous section. In some embodiments, the VEGI polypeptide serves to bind a specific<br>
antibody. In other embodiments a VEGI polypeptide is an immunogen. In yet other<br>
embodiments a VEGI polypeptide inhibits vascular endothelial cell growth and/or angiogenesis.<br>
Methods for testing the activity of a VEGI polypeptide (including a truncated form of VEGI) is<br>
well known in the art and are described in the Examples in detail, such as assay for testing effect<br>
on vascular endothelial cell growth, capillary-like tube formation, capillary growth in collagen<br>
gels placed on chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, xenograft tumor growth.<br>
The size of the polypeptide fragments may vary widely. Thus, the invention includes<br>
polypeptide fragments of full-length VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b comprising a portion of the amino acid<br>
sequence depicted in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO.4) or Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5) in which the VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b polypeptide is at least about 5, about 10, about 15,25,50,75,100,150, or more<br>
contiguous amino acids of a sequence shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4) or Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5).<br>
It is understood that the fragments comprising at least one amino acids within amino acids 1-26<br>
of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, preferably a region, within amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID<br>
NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the portion of the amino acid sequence comprises<br>
amino acids 26 and 27 shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4) or Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5). In some<br>
embodiments, the portion of the amino acid sequence are within amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4<br>
or SEQ ID NO:5. As is evident to one skilled in the art, these polypeptides, regardless of their size,<br>
may also be associated with, or conjugated with, other substances or agents to facilitate, enhance, or<br>
modulate function and/or specificity of a VEGI-192a or a VEGI-192b polypeptide. These fragments<br>
may be used for a variety of purposes, including as an immunogen (either alone or in conjunction<br>
with a suitable agent), or as an agent to inhibit angiogenesis. The fragments (as with polypeptides)<br>
should have one or more of the biological functions described above for a VEGI polypeptide. In<br>
some embodiments, the fragments inhibit angiogenesis. The truncated forms may be less than<br>
about any of the following: 185,170,160,150,125,100,80,50,40,25,20,15, or 10 amino acids.<br>
It is understood that, a region of contiguous amino acids or nucleotides that are within a<br>
given pair of amino acids or nucleotides can, but not necessarily, include either member of the<br>
specified pair. For example, the contiguous amino acids within amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ED NO:4<br>
can include amino acid 1 and/or amino acid 26 of SEQ ID NO:4.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the polypeptides of the invention comprise at least<br>
5, at least 8, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, or more contiguous amino acids within<br>
amino acid residues 1-26 shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4) or Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5) (which<br>
generally may also be referred to as regions). The invention also provides polypeptides<br>
comprising amino acid residues about 5-192,10-192,15-192,20-192, 25-192 of the sequence<br>
shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4) or Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5).<br>
The embodiments of the present invention excludes any polypeptides consisting of amino<br>
acids 27-192 of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5 or a truncated form of such polypeptides.<br>
The present invention further include polypeptides which have at least 90% similarity,<br>
more preferably at least 95% similarity, and still more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%<br>
similarity to those described above. The polypeptides of the invention also comprise those,<br>
which are at least 80% identical, more preferably at least 90%, or 95% identical, still more<br>
preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the polypeptides described herein and<br>
also include portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at<br>
least 50 amino acids. In some embodiments, the invention provides polypeptides which have at<br>
least 90% similarity, more preferably at least 95% similarity, and still more preferably at least<br>
96%, 97%, 98% or 99% similarity to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 or the polypeptide of SEQ<br>
ID NO:5. The polypeptides of the invention also comprise those, which are at least 80%<br>
identical, more preferably at least 90%; or 95% identical, still more preferably at least 96%,<br>
97%, 98% or 99% identical to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 or the polypeptide of SEQ ID<br>
NO:5.<br>
This invention also provides fusion proteins comprising polypeptides described herein.<br>
The polypeptides described herein can be fused with sequences, such as sequences that enhance<br>
immunological reactivity, facilitate the coupling of the polypeptide to a support or a carrier, or<br>
facilitate purification (e.g., sequences encoding epitopes such as Myc, HA derived from<br>
influenza virus hemagglutinin, His-6, or FLAG). In addition, the protein or polynucleotide can<br>
be fused to other or polypeptides which increase its function, or specify its localization in the<br>
cell, such as a secretion sequence is discloses herein. For Methods for producing the<br>
recombinant fusion protein described above are common in the art. The recombinant or fusion<br>
protein can be isolated by methods well known in the art. Tile transformed host cells can be<br>
used to analyze the effectiveness of drugs and agents which inhibit or activate VEGI function,<br>
such as host proteins or chemically derived agents or other proteins which interact with VEGI<br>
polynucleotides to down-regulate or alter the expression of VEGI polypeptides or affect its<br>
ability to inhibit angiogenesis. A method for testing the effectiveness of an anti-VEGI or anti-<br>
angiogenesis drug or agent can for example, be the blockage of the endothelial cell growth<br>
inhibitor.<br>
This invention encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions,<br>
comprising polypeptides described herein. In some embodiments, the composition comprises<br>
polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4. This composition is useful for inhibiting angiogenesis. These<br>
compositions may further comprise suitable excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients including buffers, which are well known in the art.<br>

may optionally provide additional components such as, buffers and instructions.<br>
This invention also provides polypeptides described herein attached to a solid support.<br>
Methods of making such attachment, for example attaching to an array surface, are well known<br>
in the art. The polypeptides of the invention attached to a solid support, such as, particles of<br>
agarose, SEPHADEX, or the like, are useful for screening molecules that selectively binding the<br>
polypeptides describe herein.<br>
The invention also encompasses an array comprising VEGI isoform polypeptides of the<br>
invention, as described herein. Therefore, in one aspect, the invention provides an array<br>

contiguous amino acids in length (or more, e.g. at least 10,15,25, 50,75,100,150, or more amino<br>
acids in length). In some embodiments, the region comprises amino acids 26 and 27 of the<br>
sequence shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4). In other embodiments, the region is within amino<br>
acids 1-26 of the sequence shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4).<br>

sequence shown in Table 5 (SEQ ID NO.5). In other embodiments, the region is within amino<br>

The terms "polypeptide", and "protein" are used interchangeably herein, and, as is well-<br>
known in the art to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. In various embodiments, the<br>
polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, it may be interrupted<br>
by non-amino acids, and/or it may be assembled into a complex of more than one polypeptide<br>
chain. As is well understood in the art, a polypeptide may be modified naturally or by<br>
intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation,<br>
phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling<br>
component. In some embodiments, polypeptides contain one or more analogs of an amino acid<br>
(including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the<br>
art.<br>
This invention also includes functionally preserved variants of the VEGI polypeptides<br>
described herein. Such variants may be made using methods standard in the art, for example, by<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions. In various embodiments, a functionally preserved variant<br>
comprises preserved variant comprises (or, in some embodiments, consist of) any of one, two, three,<br>
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten conservative amino acid substitutions.<br>
Vectors and host cells<br><br>
The present invention also relates to vectors which include the isolated polynucleotides of<br>
the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors,<br>
or which are otherwise engineered to produce the polypeptides of the invention, and the<br>
production of polypeptides of the invention by recombinant techniques.<br>
The term "vector" refers to a plasmid, virus or other vehicle known in the art that has<br>
been manipulated by insertion or incorporation of the VEGI-251, VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b genetic<br>
sequences or fragments thereof. This polynucleotide (generally, DNA) element which renders<br>
the vector suitable for multiplication can be an origin of replication which works in prokaryotic<br>
or eukaryotic cells. An example for an origin of replication which works in prokaryotic cells is<br>
the colEl ori. A recombinant vector needs further a selection marker for control of growth of<br>
these organisms which harbor the vector. Suitable selection markers include genes which protect<br>
organisms from antibiotics (antibioticum resistance), for example, ampicillin, streptomycin,<br>
chloramphenicol or provide growth under compound deprived environmental conditions<br>
(auxotrophic growth conditions) when expressed as proteins in cells. In a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention for multiplication of the recombinant vector the prokaryotic cells are bacteria. In<br>
special preferred versions of the inventions the bacteria are in particular bacteria of Escherichia<br>
coli or of Bacillus sp. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention for the multiplication<br>
of the recombinant vector the eukaryotic cells are cells of a cell line or yeast cells. In special<br>
preferred versions of the invention the cells of the cell line are cells of a CHO, COS, Hela-, or<br>
3T3 -cell-line and the yeast cells are cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
The present invention includes a variety of vectors (i.e., cloning and/or expression<br>
vectors, as well as vectors for cloning and/or replication) having cloned therein VEGI-192a,<br>
VEGI-192b, or VEGI-251 polynucleotide(s). These vectors can be used for expression of<br>
recombinant polypeptides as well as a source of VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, or VEGI-251<br>
polynucleotides. Cloning vectors can be used to obtain replicate copies of the VEGI-192a, VEGI-<br>
192b, or VEGI-251 polynucleotides they contain, or as a means of storing the polynucleotides in a<br>
depository for future recovery. Expression vectors (and host cells containing these expression<br>
vectors) can be used to obtain polypeptides produced from the polynucleotides they contain.<br>
They may also be used where it is desirable to express VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, or VEGI-251<br>
polypeptides in an individual, such as for eliciting an immune response via the polypeptide(s)<br>
encoded in the expression vector(s). Suitable cloning and expression vectors include any known<br>
in the art e.g., those for use in bacterial, mammalian, yeast and insect expression systems.<br>
Specific vectors and suitable host cells are known in the art and need not be described in detail<br>
herein. For example, see Gacesa and Ramji, Vectors, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1994).<br>
Cloning and expression vectors typically contain a selectable marker (for example, a gene<br>
encoding a protein necessary for the survival or growth of a host cell transformed with the<br>
vector), although such a marker gene can be carried on another polynucleotide sequence co-<br>
introduced into the host cell. Only those host cells into which a selectable gene has been<br>
introduced will survive and/or grow under selective conditions. Typical selection genes encode<br>
protein(s) that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins substances, e.g., ampicillin,<br>
neomycyin, methotrexate, etc.; (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies; or (c) supply critical<br>
nutrients not available from complex media. The choice of the proper marker gene will depend<br>
on the host cell, and appropriate genes for different hosts are known in the art. Cloning and<br>
expression vectors also typically contain a replication system recognized by the host.<br>
Suitable cloning vectors may be constructed according to standard techniques, or may be<br>
selected from a large number of cloning vectors available in the art. While the cloning vector<br>
selected may vary according to the host cell intended to be used, useful cloning vectors will<br>
generally have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single target for a particular restriction<br>
endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker that can be used in selecting clones<br>
containing the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial viruses, e.g., pUCl 8,<br>
pUC19, Bluescript (e.g., pBS SK+) and its derivatives, mpl8, mpl9, pBR322, pMB9, ColE1,<br>
pCR1, RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and pAT28. These and many other<br>
cloning vectors are available from commercial vendors such as BioRad, Strategene, and<br>
Invitrogen.<br>
Expression vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide constructs that contain a<br>
polynucleotide encoding a VEGI polypeptide of interest. The polynucleotide encoding the VEGI<br>
polypeptide is operatively linked to suitable transcriptional controlling elements, such as<br>
promoters, enhancers and terminators. For expression (i.e., translation), one or more<br>
translational controlling elements are also usually required, such as ribosome binding sites,<br>
translation initiation sites, and stop codons. These controlling elements (transcriptional and<br>
translational) may be derived from VEGI polynucleotides (i.e., one of the VEGI isoform gene),<br>
or they may be heterologous (i.e., derived from other genes and/or other organisms). A<br>
polynucleotide sequence encoding a signal peptide can also be included to allow a VEGI<br>
polypeptide to cross and/or lodge in cell membranes or be secreted from the cell. A number of<br>
expression vectors suitable for expression in eukaryotic cells including yeast, avian, and<br>
mammalian cells are known in the art.<br>
The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can be introduced into the host cell<br>
by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing<br>
calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances;<br>
microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (where the vector is an infectious agent,<br>
such as vaccinia virus). The choice of means of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often<br>
depend on the host cell.<br>
The invention includes further a host cell and a cell culture comprised of the host cells.<br>
This host cell comprising at least one recombinant polynucleotide (generally, DNA) vector was<br>
mentioned before. "Host cells" are cells in which a vector can be propagated and its DNA<br>
expressed. The cell may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The term also includes any progeny of the<br>
subject host cell. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical to the parental cell since<br>
there may be mutations that occur during replication. However, such progeny are included when<br>
the term "host cell" is used. Methods of stable transfer, meaning that the foreign DNA is<br>
continuously maintained in the host, are known in the art. When the host cell is taken from<br>
prokaryotic cells it preferably consists of a cell of a bacterium in particular of Escherichia coli or<br>
Bacillus sp. When this host cell consists of a eukaryotic cell it is preferred a cell of a cell line in<br>
particular a cell of a COS-, a Hela-, or 3T3-cell-line or a cell of a yeast in particular a cell of<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
The host cells of this invention can be used, inter alia, as repositories of VEGI<br>
polynucleotides and/or vehicles for production of VEGI polynucleotides and/or polypeptides as<br>
described herein. Host cells can also serve as repositories of mutant VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, or<br>
VEGI-251 polynucleotides, as further described herein. Such hosts cells can be useful for<br>
screening, production of therapeutic protein or polypeptide as further described herein.<br>
Antibodies and their preparation<br>
The invention also provides antibodies that selectively bind to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-<br>
192b (including fragments) proteins as described herein. The term "antibody" includes, but not<br>
limited to intact molecules, fragments thereof, such as Fab, (Fab'), Fv, which are capable of<br>
binding the epitopic determinant. These antibody fragments retain some ability to selectively<br>
bind with its antigen or receptor and are defined as follows:<br>
(1) Fab, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody molecule can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to<br>
yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain;<br>
(2) Fab1, the fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating whole<br>
antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the<br>
heavy chain; two Fab' fragments are obtained per antibody molecule;<br>
(3) (Fab')2, the fragment of the antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody<br>
with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; (Fab')2, is a dimer of two Fab' fragments<br>
held together by two disulfide bonds;<br>
(4) Fv, defined as a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the<br>
light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains; and<br>
(5) Single chain antibody ("SCA"), defined as a genetically engineered molecule<br>
containing the variable region of the light chain, the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by<br>
a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may be any one or more of<br>
the following: polyclonal, monoclonal, single chain (ScFv), mutants of these embodiments,<br>
fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion (such as one or more CDR regions), humanized<br>
antibodies, chimeric antibodies, human antibodies, or any modified configuration of the<br>
immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity.<br>
As is understood in the art, a "monoclonal antibody" refers to a homogeneous antibody<br>
population wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally occurring<br>
and non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding of an antigen.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The<br>
term "monoclonal antibody" encompasses not only intact monoclonal antibodies and full-length<br>
monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain<br>
(ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, humanized monoclonal<br>
antibodies, chimeric monoclonal antibodies, and any other modified configuration of the<br>
immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity<br>
and the ability to bind to an antigen. It is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of<br>
the antibody or the manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant<br>
expression, transgenic animals, etc.).<br>
"Humanized" antibodies refer to a molecule having an antigen binding site that is<br>
substantially derived from an immunoglobulin from a non-human species and the remaining<br>
immunoglobulin structure of the molecule based upon the structure and/or sequence of a human<br>
immunoglobulin. The antigen binding site may comprise either complete variable domains fused<br>
onto constant domains or only the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) grafted onto<br>
appropriate framework regions in the variable domains. Antigen binding sites may be wild type<br>
or modified by one or more amino acid substitutions, e.g., modified to resemble human<br>
immunoglobulin more closely. Some forms of humanized antibodies preserve all CDR<br>
sequences (for example, a humanized mouse antibody which contains all six CDRs from the<br>
mouse antibodies). Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (one, two,<br>
three, four, five, six) which are altered with respect to the original antibody, which are also<br>
termed one or more CDRs "derived from" one or more CDRs from the antibody.<br>
Methods of making antibodies and antibody fragments are known in the art. (See for<br>
example, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,<br>
New York, 1988, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The invention also provides an antibody that selectively binds a polypeptide comprising<br>
SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5 or a fragment thereof, wherein the fragment is within amino acids<br>
1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, or the fragment comprises amino acids 26 and 27 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5. The invention also provides antibodies that selectively binds<br>
VEGI-192a and VEGI-192b but not other isoforms of VEGI (does not selectively bind to other<br>
VEGI isoforms, such as VEGI-251). This invention also provides antibodies that selectively<br>
binds VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b.<br>
The present invention further provides an antibody that selectively binds a polypeptide<br>
encoded by SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3 or a fragment thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides an antibody that selectively binds to a<br>
polypeptide comprising a region of at least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, or<br>
more contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, wherein the region is within<br>
amino acid residues 1-26 shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:4) or Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:5). In other<br>
embodiments, the invention provides an antibody that selectively binds to a polypeptide<br>
comprising a region of at least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, or more<br>
contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, wherein the region comprises amino<br>
acids 26 and 27 of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5.<br>
In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention inhibits VEGI activity; for example,<br>
such an antibody could promote angiogenesis. Methods of screening such antibody are<br>
described below.<br>
In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention can be an agonist antibody in that it<br>
promotes VEGI activity. Methods of screening such antibody are described below.<br>
It is understood that, in this context, in which there are various isoforms of VEGI,<br>
selective binding indicates binding preferentially (or even exclusively) to a given isoform as<br>
compared to another isoform (unless already indicated otherwise). In some embodiments, the<br>
antibody selectively binds a VEGI polypeptide of the invention as compared to a non-human<br>
VEGI isoform. As an example, an antibody of the invention could selectively bind human<br>
VEGI-192a but not mouse (non-human) VEGI-192a.<br>
The antibodies of this invention can be linked (i.e., conjugated) to a detectable agent or a<br>
hapten. The complex is useful to detect the polypeptide(s) (or polypeptide fragments) to which<br>
the antibody specifically binds in a sample, using standard immunochemical techniques such as<br>
immunohistochemistry as described by Harlow and Lane (1988), supra. Examples of types of<br>
immunoassays which can utilize monoclonal antibodies of the invention are competitive and<br>
non-competitive immunoassays in either a direct or indirect format. Examples of such<br>
hnmunoassays are the enzyme linked immunoassay (ELIS A) radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the<br>
sandwich (immunometric) assay. Detection of using the monoclonal antibodies of the invention<br>
can be done by utilizing immunoassays which are run in either the forward, reverse, or<br>
simultaneous modes, including immunohistochemical assays on physiological samples. Those of<br>
skill in the art will know, or can readily discern, other immunoassay formats without undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
Another technique which may also result in greater sensitivity consists of coupling the<br>
antibodies to low molecular weight haptens. These haptens can then be specifically detected by<br>
means of a second reaction. For example, it is common to use such haptens as biotin, which<br>
reacts avidin, or dinitropherryl, pyridoxal, and fluorescein, which can react with specific anti-<br>
hapten antibodies. See Harlow and Lane (1988) supra.<br>
The antibodies of the invention can be bound to many different carriers. Thus, this<br>
invention also provides compositions containing antibodies and a carrier. Carriers can be active<br>
and/or inert. Examples of well-known carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides,<br>
agaroses and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for purposes<br>
of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable carriers for binding<br>
monoclonal antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation.<br>
There are many different labels and methods of labeling known to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art. Examples of the types of labels which can be used in the present invention include<br>
enzymes, radioisotopes, fluorescent compounds, colloidal metals, chemiluminescent compounds,<br>
and bioluminescent compounds. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of other suitable<br>
labels for binding to the monoclonal antibody, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine<br>
experimentation. Furthermore, the binding of these labels to the monoclonal antibody of the<br>
invention can be done using standard techniques common to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
For purposes of the invention, polypeptides of this invention may be detected by the<br>
antibodies of the invention when present in samples, such as fluids and tissues. This use of<br>
antibodies is discussed in more detail below.<br>
Compositions containing the antibodies, fragments thereof or cell lines which produce the<br>
antibodies, are encompassed by this invention. When these compositions are to be used<br>
pharmaceutically, they are combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Arrays<br>
comprising the antibodies or fragments thereof are encompassed by this invention. Antibodies<br>
may be immobilized on a surface, e.g., an array for use in detection and diagnostic assays as<br>
described in more detail below. Antibodies may also be immobilized on a support for<br>
purification of the polypeptides or fragments described herein.<br>
Compositions<br>
The present invention further provides compositions, including pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, comprising the polypeptides, polynucleotides, antibodies, recombinant vectors,<br>
and host cells of the invention. These compositions may include a buffer, which is selected<br>
according to the desired use of the polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, recombinant vector, or<br>
host cell, and may also include other substances appropriate to the intended use. Those skilled in<br>
the art can readily select an appropriate buffer, a wide variety of which are known in the art,<br>
suitable for an intended use. In some instances, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition<br>
and can comprise a pharmaceutical acceptable excipient, a variety of which are known in the art<br>
and need not be discussed in detail herein. Pharmaceutical acceptable excipients have been<br>
amply described in a variety of publications, including, for example, A. Gennaro (2000)<br>
"Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy", 20th edition, Lippincott, Williams, &amp;<br>
Wilkins.<br>
Kits comprising polynucleotides, polypeptides, and/or antibodies of the invention<br>
As described herein, the present invention also encompasses kits containing<br>
polynucleotide(s), polypeptide(s), and/or antibodies of this invention, such as kits for diagnosis,<br>
for therapy. Kits embodied by this invention include those that allow someone to conduct an<br>
assay for the presence of VEGI polynucleotides, polypeptides, and/or anti-VEGI antibodies, such<br>
as any of those describe herein, thus detecting and/or quantitating those molecules. Accordingly,<br>
the invention includes (a) a kit for detection or quantification of a VEGI polynucleotide in a<br>
sample comprising any of the VEGI polynucleotide described herein; (b) a kit comprising any of<br>
the antibodies described herein for detection or quantification of a VEGI polypeptide in a<br>
sample; (c) a kit comprising any of the polypeptides described herein for detection or<br>
quantification of anti-VEGI antibody in a sample. The invention also provides kits comprising<br>
polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention for use in therapy.<br>
The kits of this invention are in suitable packaging, and may optionally provide<br>
additional components that are useful in the procedure. These optional components include, but<br>
are not limited to, buffers, capture reagents, developing reagents, labels, reacting surfaces, means<br>
for detection, control samples, instructions, and interpretive information.<br>
Methods of using polynucleotides, polypeptides and antibodies: Detection systems<br>
The invention also provides methods using the VEGI-192a and VEGI-192b polynucleotides,<br>
polypeptides, and/or antibodies of the invention to detect suitable targets in a sample. As this<br>
disclosure makes clear, detection methods refer to any of detecting presence, absence, as well as<br>
quantitation. Procedures for conducting diagnostic (i.e., detection) tests using polynucleotides,<br>
polypeptides or antibodies are extensively known in the art and are routine for a practitioner or<br>
ordinary skill. Generally, to perform a diagnostic method of this invention, one of the<br>
compositions of this invention is provided as a reagent to detect a target with which it reacts in a<br>
sample. The target is supplied by obtaining a suitable sample from an individual for whom the<br>
diagnostic parameter is to be measured. Many types of samples are suitable for this purpose. If<br>
desired, the target may be partially purified from the sample or amplified before the assay is<br>
conducted.<br>
The present invention relates to a method of detecting the presence or absence or level of<br>
VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b polypeptides in a sample comprising contacting a sample from a human<br>
or animal with antibodies which selectively binds to the polypeptide described herein, and<br>
detecting the presence or absence or the amount of a complex formed between the polypeptide<br>
and the antibodies. Such detecting is useful for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis, and/or<br>
monitoring of an angiogenic-associated disease. In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>
method for the diagnosis of pathological angiogenesis comprising the steps of contacting a<br>
sample from a human or animal suspected of having pathological angiogenesis with antibodies<br>
which recognize the polypeptide described herein, and detecting the presence or absence of a<br>
complex formed between the polypeptide and the antibodies.<br>
A competition assay can be employed wherein antibodies that selectively bind to VEGI-<br>
192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptides are attached to a solid support and labeled VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b and a sample derived from the host are passed over the solid support and the amount<br>
of label detected, for example, by liquid scintillation chromatography, can be correlated to a<br>
quantity of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b in the sample.<br>
A "sandwich" assay is similar to an ELISA assay. In a "sandwich" assay VEGI-192a<br>
and/or VEGI-192b is passed over a solid support and binds to antibody attached to a solid support.<br>
A second antibody is then bound to the VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b. A third antibody which is<br>
labeled and specific to the second antibody is then passed over the solid support and binds to the<br>
second antibody and an amount can then be quantitated.<br>
Using standard methodology well known in the art, a diagnostic assay can be constructed<br>
by coating on a surface (i.e., a solid support), for example, a microtitration plate or a membrane<br>
(e.g. nitrocellulose membrane), antibodies specific for or which selectively bind to, VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b polypeptides or both, and contacting the coated surface with serum, tissue or other<br>
biological or chemical sample obtained from a person suspected of having an angiogenic-<br>
associated disease. The presence or absence of a resulting complex formed between VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b polypeptide in the sample and antibodies specific therefor can be detected by any of<br>
the known methods common in the art, such as fluorescent antibody spectroscopy or colorimetry.<br>
This method of detection can be used, for example, for the diagnosis or prognosis of cancer.<br>
Assaying VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide levels in a sample can use any<br>
antibody-based techniques that are well known in the art. For example, VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-<br>
192b polypeptide expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods<br>
(Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol.<br>
105:3087-3096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b polypeptide gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked<br>
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels<br>
are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such<br>
as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (112In), and technetium<br>
(99mTc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.<br>
In addition to assaying VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide levels in a sample<br>
obtained from an individual, VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide can also be detected in<br>
vivo by imaging. Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b<br>
polypeptide include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR or ESR. For X-radiography,<br>
suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation<br>
but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with<br>
a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody<br>
by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma.<br>
An antibody or antibody fragment that selectively binds to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b<br>
polypeptide which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a<br>
radioisotope (for example, 1311,112In, 99mTc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable<br>
by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously or<br>
intraperitoneally) into the mammal to be examined for immune system disorder. It will be<br>
understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the<br>
quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope<br>
moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from<br>
about 5 to 20 millicuries of "mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then<br>
preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b<br>
polypeptide. In vivo tumor imaging is described by Burchiel and coworkers (Chapter 13 in<br>
Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, Burchiel, S. W. and Rhodes, B. A.,<br>
eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)).<br>
As is understood in the art, VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptides may be detected<br>
using any agent which selectively binds to the polypeptides.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a diagnostic kit comprising<br>
antibodies that selectively binds to the polypeptides of the present invention, for example,<br>
antibodies that selectively binds VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b or both polypeptides, and ancillary<br>
reagents suitable for use in detecting the presence of the polypeptide in a sample. These reagents<br>
are well known in the art and that are suitable for use in detecting the presence or absence of<br>
VEGI polypeptides in a serum, tissue or other sample. Tissue samples contemplated can be<br>
obtained from monkey or human, or other mammals. The kit may further include instructions<br>
for use, controls, and interpretative information.<br>
This invention also provides a method for detecting the presence or absence or the level<br>
of the polynucleotides described herein comprising contacting a sample from an individual such<br>
as a human or an animal with a polynucleotide (in some embodiments, an oligonucleotide) which<br>
selectively binds to the polynucleotide described herein, and detecting the presence or absence or<br>
the amount of a duplex formed between the polynucleotide used and a polynucleotide in the<br>
sample. In some embodiments, the method of the invention, which is useful for the diagnosis of<br>
pathological angiogenesis comprising the steps of contacting a sample from a human or animal<br>
suspected of having pathological angiogenesis with a polynucleotide (such as an oligonucleotide)<br>
which binds to the polynucleotide described herein, and detecting the presence or absence of a<br>
duplex formed between the polynucleotide used and a polynucleotide in the sample, hi another<br>
embodiment, the present invention relates to RNA, DNA or other nucleotide sequences for use in<br>
detecting the presence or absence of VEGI polynucleotides using the polymerase chain reaction<br>
(PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Other primer-based amplification methods may<br>
be used. The DNA sequence of the present invention shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:1 or Table<br>
2 (SEQ ID NO:2) can be used to design primers which specifically bind to the VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b polynucleotide sequence in the case of PCR, or to a VEGI-192a or a VEGI-192b cDNA<br>
produced from reverse transcription of an RNA encoding a VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b polypeptide,<br>
for the purpose of detecting the presence, absence, or quantitating the amount of VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b polynucleotide by comparison to a standard. The primers can be any length ranging,<br>
for example, from 7-40 nucleotides, preferably 10-15 nucleotides, most preferably 18-25<br>
nucleotides. Reagents and controls necessary for PCR or RT-PCR reactions are well known in<br>
the art. The amplified products can then be analyzed for the presence or absence of VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b polynucleotide sequences, for example by gel fractionation, with or without<br>
hybridization, by radiochemistry, and immunochemical techniques. This method is advantageous<br>
since only a small sample size is required to generate a sufficient amount of template DNA with<br>
which to perform PCR or RT-PCR.<br>
In some embodiments, the detection methods entail using one or more primers to amplify<br>
the VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b sequence of interest. In other embodiments, detection is<br>
accomplished using specific probes (such as labeled probes) which detect presence or absence of<br>
(or can quantitate) a VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b sequence of interest. In some embodiments, the<br>
probe comprises a label.<br>
In some embodiments, the method is used for detecting level of VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b<br>
by detecting the presence or absence or the amount of cellular RNA encoding VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b or a fragment described herein. Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a sample<br>
using any suitable technique such as the single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate-ph- enol-<br>
chloroform method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (Anal. Biochem. 162:156-159<br>
(1987)). Levels of mRNA encoding the VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide are then assayed<br>
using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis, SI nuclease mapping, the<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase<br>
chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction<br>
(RT-LCR).<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a diagnostic kit which contains<br>
PCR or RT-PCR primers, one or more primers, such as specific for VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b<br>
polynucleotides, and/or primers specific for other isoforms of VEGI, such VEGI-251, VEGI-174,<br>
and ancillary reagents that are well known in the art and that are suitable for use in detecting the<br>
presence or absence of VEGI isoform polynucleotides, or quantitating the amount of an RNA<br>
which encodes a VEGI isoform polypeptide in a sample using PCR or RT-PCR, or one or more<br>
other amplification methods. Samples contemplated can be obtained from humans or animals.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a diagnostic kit which contains<br>
probes, one or more probes, such as specific for VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b polynucleotides, and/or<br>
probes specific for other isoforms of VEGI, such VEGI-251, VEGI-174, and ancillary reagents that<br>
are well known in the art and that are suitable for use in detecting the presence or absence of<br>
VEGI isoform polynucleotides, or quantitating the amount of an RNA which encodes a VEGI<br>
isoform polypeptide in a sample using methods, such as Northern blotting, or one or more other<br>
methods. Samples contemplated can be obtained from humans or animals.<br>
As is understood in the art a "sample" can be any sample obtained from an individual<br>
(often referred to as a "biological sample"), body fluid, cell line, tissue culture, or other source<br>
which contains or may contain VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide or mRNA. As indicated,<br>
biological samples include body fluids (such as sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal<br>
fluid) which contain free VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide, immune and circulatory<br>
systems tissue, and other tissue sources found to express complete or mature VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b polypeptides or a VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b receptor. Methods for obtaining tissue<br>
biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample<br>
is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.<br>
By "assaying the expression level of the gene encoding the VEGI-192a aad/or VEGI-192b<br>
protein" is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the<br>
VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide or the level of the mRNA encoding the VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b polypeptide in a first sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating<br>
absolute polypeptide level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the VEGI-192a<br>
and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second sample). Preferably, the VEGI-<br>
192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first sample is measured or<br>
estimated and compared to a standard VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide level or mRNA<br>
level, the standard being taken from a second sample obtained from an individual not having the<br>
disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having a<br>
disorder of the immune and circulatory systems. As will be appreciated in the art, once a<br>
standard VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide level or mRNA level is known, it can be used<br>
repeatedly as a standard for comparison.<br>
As noted above, VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polynucleotides and polypeptides are useful<br>
for diagnosis of conditions involving abnormally high or low expression of VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b activities. Given the cells and tissues where VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b is expressed<br>
as well as the activities modulated by VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b, it is readily apparent that a<br>
substantially altered (increased or decreased) level of expression of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b<br>
in an individual compared to the standard or "normal" level produces pathological conditions<br>
related to the bodily system(s) in which VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b is expressed and/or is active.<br>
The invention also provides methods of aiding diagnosis of a VEGI associated disorder<br>
or condition. These methods assist in making a clinical determination regarding the<br>
classification, or nature, of pathological angiogenesis or prognosis of cancer, and may or may not<br>
be conclusive with respect to the definitive diagnosis. Accordingly, a method of aiding diagnosis<br>
of pathological angiogenesis or prognosis of cancer, or a related disease, can comprise the step of<br>
detecting the level of VEGI isoforms (i.e. VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b) expression in a sample from the<br>
individual. A method of aiding diagnosis of angiogenesis-associated disease can also comprise<br>
the step of detecting altered levels of a VEGI isoform polynucleotide and/or polypeptide in a<br>
sample from the individual and/or detecting increased or decreased levels of a VEGI isoform<br>
polynucleotide and/or polypeptide in a sample from the individual.<br>
The invention also provides method of detecting an individual at risk who may or may<br>
not have detectable angiogenesis associated disease, and/or a condition associated with an<br>
abnormal level of VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease<br>
prior to the treatment methods described therein. "At risk" denotes that an individual who is<br>
determined to be more likely to develop a symptom based on conventional risk assessment<br>
methods or has one or more risk factors that correlate with development of angiogenesis-<br>
associated disease. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher<br>
probability of developing angiogenesis-associated disease than an individual without these risk<br>
factors. Examples (i.e., categories) of risk groups are well known in the art and discussed herein.<br>
The VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polynucleotide can also be used as probes for the<br>
detection of the presence or absence of mutantions or polymorphisms in VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-<br>
192b gene, as well as any VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b sequence of interest, whether or not a mutation.<br>
A mutant VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b may be associated with angiogenesis or various immune<br>
and circulatory system-related disorders. Methods for detecting mutant polynucleotide<br>
sequences are well known in the art, and include, e.g., single strand conformational<br>
polymorphism (SSCP), and various sequence amplification based methods for detecting<br>
sequence mutations including point mutations, e.g., LCR, NASBA, PCR, limited primer<br>
extension, etc. Methods for detecting altered protein sequences include Western blot analysis,<br>
capillary electrophoresis, mass spectroscopy, and WAVE. Generally, a detection experiment<br>
will be performed in parallel with a control VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polynucleotide or,<br>
polypeptide, or, in the case when altered expression levels are being assessed, with a control<br>
sample possessing normal levels of a VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polynucleotide or polypeptide.<br>
The sequences of the present invention are valuable for chromosome identification. The<br>
sequence is specifically targeted to and can hybridize with a particular location on an individual<br>
human chromosome. Moreover, there is a current need for identifying particular sites on the<br>
chromosome. The mapping of DNAs to chromosomes according to the present invention is an<br>
important first step in correlating those sequences.<br>
Briefly, sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably<br>
15-25 bp) from the cDNA. Computer analysis of the 3' untranslated region of the sequence is<br>
used to rapidly select primers that do not span more than one exon in the genomic DNA, thus<br>
complicating the amplification process. These primers are then used for PCR screening of<br>
somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing<br>
the human gene corresponding to the primer will yield an amplified fragment.<br>
PCR mapping of somatic cell hybrids is a rapid procedure for assigning a particular DNA<br>
to a particular chromosome. Using the present invention with the same oligonucleotide primers,<br>
sublocalization can be achieved with panels of fragments from specific chromosomes or pools of<br>
large genomic clones in an analogous manner. Other mapping strategies that can similarly be<br>
used to map to its chromosome include in situ hybridization, prescreening with labeled flow-<br>
sorted chromosomes and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific-cDNA<br>
libraries.<br>
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a cDNA clone to a metaphase chromosomal<br>
spread can be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. This technique can be<br>
used with cDNA as short as 50 or 60 bases. For a review of this technique, see Verma et ah,<br>
Human Chromosomes: a Manual of Basic Techniques, Pergamon Press, New York (1988).<br>
Once a sequence is mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of<br>
the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found,<br>
for example, in V. McKusick, Mendelian Inheritance in Man. The relationship between genes<br>
and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through<br>
linkage analysis (coinheritance of physically adjacent genes).<br>
Next, it is necessary to determine the differences in the cDNA or genomic sequence<br>
between affected and unaffected subject. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected<br>
individuals but not in any normal subjects, then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of<br>
the disease; a gene localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of<br>
between 50 and 500 potential causative genes. This assumes I megabase mapping resolution and<br>
one gene per 20 kb. Utilizing the techniques described above, the chromosomal location of<br>
VEGI was detemined with very high confidence to be 9q32. Previous chromosomal mapping<br>
studies have linked several developmental defects to loci in this area of chromosome 9.<br>
The present invention is also useful for diagnosis or treatment of various immune and<br>
circulatory system-related disorders in mammals, preferably humans. Such disorders include<br>
infections by bacteria, viruses, and other parasites, immunodeficiencies, inflammatory diseases,<br>
lymphadenopathy, autoimmune diseases, graft versus host disease, and any disregulation of<br>
immune and circulatory systems cell function including, but not limited to, autoimmunity,<br>
leukemias, lymphomas, immunosuppression, immunity, humoral immunity, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, myelo suppression, and the like.<br>
For a number of disorders, substantially altered (increased or decreased) levels of VEGI-<br>
192a and/or VEGI-192b gene expression can be detected in various tissue (such as circulatory<br>
tissue) or other cells or bodily fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid)<br>
taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to a "standard" VEQI-192a and/or VEGI-<br>
192b gene expression level, that is, the VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b expression level from an<br>
individual not having the disorder. Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful<br>
during diagnosis of a VEGI associated disorder, which involves measuring the expression level<br>
of the gene encoding the VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b protein in a sample from an individual and<br>
comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b gene<br>
expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the<br>
standard is indicative of the disorder.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a VEGI-<br>
associated disorder which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the<br>
VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b protein in a sample from an individual and comparing the measured<br>
gene expression level with a standard VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b gene expression level,<br>
whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is<br>
indicative of the disorder.<br>
Where a diagnosis of a disorder has already been made according to conventional<br>
methods, the present invention is useful as a prognostic and/or monitoring indicator, whereby<br>
patients exhibiting depressed VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b gene expression will experience a<br>
worse clinical outcome relative to patients expressing the gene at a level nearer the standard<br>
level.<br>
Methods of using polynucleotides, polypeptides and antibodies: Screening assays<br>
The polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may be employed as<br>
research reagents and materials for discovery of treatments and diagnostics to human disease.<br>
This invention provides a method for identifying agents which modulate an activity of<br>
VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b; methods for identifying agents which modulate the expression of<br>
VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b in a cell. In some embodiments, the assay is a cell-free assay. In<br>
other embodiments, the assay is a cell-based assay,<br>
As used herein, the term "modulate" encompasses "increase" and "decrease". In some<br>
embodiments, of particular interest are agents, which inhibit an activity VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-<br>
i92b- Such agents are useful for promoting angiogenesis. In other embodiments, agents of<br>
interest are those that increase an activity of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b- Such agents are of<br>
interest for inhibiting angiogenesis and treating angiogenesis associated disease.<br>
Generally, the screening or testing methods employ agents or drugs from any variety of<br>
sources. An agent or drug may be, for example, a biological or chemical compound such as a<br>
simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, oligonucleotide,<br>
polynucleotide, carbohydrate, or lipoprotein. A vast array of compounds can be synthesized, for<br>
example oligomers, such as oligopeptides and oligonucleotides, and synthetic organic<br>
compounds based on various core structures, and these are also included in the term "agent". In<br>
addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal<br>
extracts, and the like. Compounds can be tested singly or in combination with one another.<br>
The invention provides methods for identifying agents that modulates an activity of<br>
VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b after binding to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b. The method generally<br>
comprises contacting a testing agent that selectively binds to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b with a<br>
sample containing a VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b; and assaying an activity of VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI-192b in the presence or absence of the agents. An increase or a decrease in an activity of<br>
VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b in the presence of the agent compared to in the absence of the agent<br>
indicates that the agent increase (agonist) or decrease (antagonist) the activity of VEGI-192a<br>
and/or VEGI-192b- Potential agonists or antagonist include small organic molecules, peptides,<br>
polypeptides and antibodies that bind to a polypeptide of the invention and thereby increase or<br>
decrease its activity.<br>
Assays for testing the ability of an agent for selectively binding to a polypeptide of the<br>
invention is known in the art. For example, the polypeptides of the invention can be attached to<br>
a solid support and the agent that selectively binds to the polypeptide can be identified using<br>
methods known in the art. Alternatively, VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b agonist and/or antagonists<br>
may be detected by combining VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b and a potential agonist and/or antagonist<br>
with membrane-bound VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b receptors (if such receptors are identified) or<br>
recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. VEGI-<br>
192a or VEGI-192b can be labeled, such as by radioactivity, such that the number of VEGI-192a or<br>
VEGI-192b molecules bound to the receptor can determine the effectiveness of the potential<br>
agonist and/or antagonist.<br>
Assays for testing activity of VEGI are known in the art. Examples of such cell-based<br>
assays are described in the Examples in further detail, such as testing effect on vascular<br>
endothelial cell growth, formation and organization of endothelial cells into capillary-like tubular<br>
structures, or organization of endothelial cells into capillary vessels in chicken embryo<br>
chorioallantoic membrane.<br>
Antibodies that selectively bind to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptides may be used<br>
as antagonists by binding to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b and preventing it from performing its<br>
activity.<br>
This invention also provides methods for identifying agents that modulates the activity of<br>
VEGI isoform described herein without binding to the VEGI isoform. Such agents include, but<br>
not limited to, agents that regulate upstream or downstream of activity VEGI. These methods<br>
comprise assaying the activity of VEGI in the presence or absence of an agent to be tested.<br>
This invention also provides methods for identifying agents that modulates a level of<br>
VEGI mRNA and/or polypeptide described herein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for identifying an agent that<br>
modulates a level of VEGI expression in a cell, the method comprising: contacting a candidate<br>
agent to be tested with a cell comprising a nucleic acid which encodes a VEGI polypeptide<br>
described herein, and determining the effect of said agent on VEGI polypeptide expression. In<br>
some embodiments, the effect is measured by detecting the level of mRNA encoding the VEGI<br>
polypeptide using the VEGI polynucleotides described herein. In other embodiments, the effect<br>
is measured by detecting the level of the VEGI polypeptide using antibodies described herein.<br>
Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules. Antisense technology can be<br>
used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple-helix<br>
formation. Antisense techniques are discussed in a number of studies (for example, Okano, J.<br>
Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); "Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene<br>
Expression." CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988)). Triple helix formation is discussed in a<br>
number of studies, as well (for instance, Lee, et al., Nucleic Acids Research 6:3073 (1979);<br>
Cooney, et al., Science 241:456 (1988); Dervan, et al., Science 251:1360 (1991)). The methods<br>
are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For example, the 5'<br>
coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention<br>
may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in<br>
length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved<br>
in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-<br>
192b. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation<br>
of the mRNA molecule into VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide. The oligonucleotides<br>
described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be<br>
expressed in vivo to inhibit production of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b polypeptide.<br>
This invention also provides methods for identifying agents such as mutants or variants<br>
of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b which may compete for binding with the targets which VEGI-192a<br>
and/or VEGI-192b bind to and prevents VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b from interacting with their<br>
targets. Such mutants or variants may be agonist or antagonist of VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b.<br>
This invention provides a method for identifying agents that bind to VEGI-192a and/or<br>
VEGI- 192b comprising contacting the agents with VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b and then detecting<br>
agents' binding to VEGI-192a and/or VEGI-192b.<br>
Methods of using polynucleotides, polypeptides and antibodies: treating disease<br>
The invention provides methods for inhibiting vascular endothelial cell growth, inhibiting<br>
angiogenesis, for the treatment or amelioration of diseases and processes that are mediated by<br>
uncontrolled angiogenesis, treating cancer, such as suppressing tumor growth. Contrary to the<br>
teachings that VEGI-251 is a membrane bound protein, the Examples show that VEGHsi is a<br>
secreted protein, inhibits vascular endothelial cell growth, and has anti-angiogenesis effect upon<br>
expression. In addition, the Example also shows that VEGI-192a inhibits vascular endothelial cell<br>
growth.<br>
Accordingly, the compositions that can be used for the method of the invention include,<br>
but not limited to, polynucleotides described herein, such as polynucleotides encoding<br>
polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6; polypeptides described herein,<br>
such as polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6, or a truncated form<br>
which comprises at least one or more amino acids from the region of amino acids 1-26 of SEQ<br>
ID NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of SEQ ID NO:6; and agonist<br>
or antagonist of VEGI polypeptides described herein, such as an antibody that blocks the activity<br>
of VEGI polypeptide.<br>
The invention also includes methods of delaying development of an angiogenesis-<br>
associated disease in an individual.<br>
VEGI isoform polypeptides of the present invention (and polynucleotides encoding VEGI<br>
isoform polypeptides) can be used to reduce the formation of capillary-like tubular structures<br>
formed by endothelial cells in vitro. VEGI isoform polypeptides of the present invention can be<br>
used to inhibit the formation of endothelial cells organized into capillary-like tubular structures<br>
in response to angiogenic factors such as FGF-2. Furthermore, isolated VEGI isoform<br>
polypeptides described herein of the present invention can also be used to inhibit the growth and<br>
organization of endothelial cells into capillary vessels in a modified chicken embryo<br>
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). As a result, VEGI isoform polypeptides of the present<br>
invention can be used to inhibit the formation of capillaries or capillary-like structures from<br>
endothelial cells in vitro.<br>
It will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal level<br>
of VEGI isoform polypeptides activities in an individual, particularly disorders of the immune<br>
and circulatory systems, can be treated by administration of VEGI isoform polypeptides<br>
described herein (or polynucleotides encoding the VEGI isoform polypeptides). Thus, the<br>
invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of a<br>
VEGI isoform activity comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an amount of an isolated VEGI isoform polypeptide of the invention (or<br>
a polynucleotide), such as a mature form of the VEGI isoform polypeptide of the invention,<br>
effective to increase the VEGI isoform polypeptide activity level in such an individual. The<br>
invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of a decreased level of a<br>
VEGI isoform activity comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an amount of antagonist of the VEGI isoform, such as an antibody<br>
specific for the VEGI isoform that blocks the activity of the VEGI isoform, effective to decrease<br>
the VEGI isoform polypeptide activity level in such an individual.<br>
Polynucleotide-based delivery<br>
In some embodiments, the invention includes a method of inhibiting angiogenesis in a<br>
tissue or cell comprising causing an effective amount of a polypeptide having an amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6, or a truncated form which<br>
comprises at least one or more amino acids from the region of amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID<br>
NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of SEQ ID NO:6 to come into<br>
contact with, or be expressed in the proximity of, the tissue or the cell, such that angiogenesis is<br>
inhibited. In some embodiments, the invention includes a method of inhibiting angiogenesis<br>
comprising administering to an individual, such as a human or animal, a composition comprising<br>
the nucleic acid molecule encoding polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID<br>
NO:6, or a truncated form which comprises at least one or more amino acids from the region of<br>
amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:6, in a dosage sufficient to inhibit angiogenesis. In some embodiments, the nucleic<br>
acid molecule is operably associated with a regulatory sequence that controls gene expression.<br>
Such regulatory sequences are known in the art.<br>
As an individual is an animal, in some embodiments, an individual may be a mammal.<br>
The invention also provides a method for the treatment or amelioration of disease and<br>
processes that are mediated by uncontrolled angiogenesis, comprising the step of administering<br>
to an individual, such as a human or animal, a composition comprising a nucleic acid molecule<br>
encoding SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6, or a truncated form which comprises<br>
at least one or more amino acids from the region of amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino<br>
acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of SEQ ID NO:6, in a dosage sufficient to<br>
control angiogenesis. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule is operably associated<br>
with a regulatory sequence that controls gene expression.<br>
This invention also provides a method for treating cancer or suppressing tumor growth<br>
comprising the step of administering to an individual, such as a human or animal, a composition<br>
comprising the nucleic acid molecule encoding SEQ ID NO:4, or a SEQ ID NO:5, or a SEQ ID<br>
NO:6, or a truncated form which comprises at least one or more amino acids from the region of<br>
amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:6, in a dosage sufficient to suppress tumor growth. In some embodiments, the<br>
nucleic acid molecule is operably associated with a regulatory sequence that controls gene<br>
expression.<br>
It is understood, if a truncated form of VEGI is used and the truncation occurs at the<br>
secretory signal sequence, the truncated form includes a secretory signal sequence, either<br>
homologous or heterologous, for directing secretion of the protein. Heterologous secretory<br>
signal sequences are known in the art.<br>
Methods of delivering polynucleotides for expression in an individual (both ex vivo and<br>
in vivo) are known in the art. Generally, an appropriate polynucleotide vector construct is<br>
prepared and administered.<br>
Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions containing polynucleotides, expression<br>
vector, or subgenomic polynucleotides can be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery<br>
techniques are described in, for example, Findeis et al., Trends Biotechnol (1993) 11:202; Chiou<br>
et ah, Gene Therapeutics: Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer (J.A. Wolff, ed.)<br>
(1994); Wu et al.,J. Biol Chem. (1988) 263:621; Wu et ah, J. Biol. Chem. (1994) 269:542;<br>
Zenke et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87:3655; Wu et ah, J- Biol. Chem. (1991)<br>
266:338. Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucleotide may be administered in a range<br>
of about 100 ng to about 200 mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol.<br>
Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1 |xg to about 2 mg, about 5 Âµg to<br>
about 500 Âµg, and about 20 Âµg to about 100 Âµg of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy<br>
protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides of the present invention can be delivered using gene<br>
delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin {see generally,<br>
Jolly, Cancer Gene Therapy (1994) 1:51; Kimura, Human Gene Therapy (1994) 5:845;<br>
Connelly, Human Gene Therapy (1995) 1:185; and Kaplitt, Nature Genetics (1994) 6:148).<br>
Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using endogenous mammalian or<br>
heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either constitutive or<br>
regulated.<br>
Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression in a desired<br>
cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to,<br>
recombinant retroviruses {see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 90/07936; WO 94/03622; WO<br>
93/25698; WO 93/25234; WO 93/11230; WO 93/10218; WO 91/02805; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,<br>
219,740 and 4,777,127; GB Patent No. 2,200,651; and EP 0 345 242), alphavirus-based vectors<br>
(e.g., Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River<br>
virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-<br>
923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532)), and adeno-associated virus (AAV)<br>
vectors {see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 94/12649, WO 93/03769; WO 93/19191; WO<br>
94/28938; WO 95/11984 and WO 95/00655). Administration of DNA linked to killed<br>
adenovirus as described in Curiel, Hum. Gene Ther. (1992) 3:147 can also be employed.<br>
Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including, but not limited<br>
to, polycationic condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone {see, e.g., Curiel,<br>
Hum. Gene Ther. (1992) 3:147); ligand-linked DNA(see, e.g., Wu, J. Biol. Chem. (1989)<br>
264:16985); eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,814,482; PCT<br>
Publication Nos. WO 95/07994; WO 96/17072; WO 95/30763; and WO 97/42338) and nucleic<br>
charge neutralization or fusion with cell membranes. Naked DNA can also be employed.<br>
Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are described in PCT Publication No. WO<br>
90/11092 and U.S. Patent No. 5,580,859. Liposomes that can act as gene delivery vehicles are<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,422,120; PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/13796; WO 94/23697;<br>
WO 91/14445; and EP 0524968. Additional approaches are described in Philip, Mol. Cell Biol.<br>
(1994) 14:2411, and in Woffendin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1994) 91:1581.<br>
Thus, for example, cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA<br>
or RNA) encoding a polypeptide, such as VEGI-251, ex vivo, with the engineered cells then being<br>
provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well-known in the art<br>
and are apparent from the teachings herein. For example, cells may be engineered by the use of a<br>
viral or a retroviral particle containing DNA or RNA encoding a polypeptide of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Similarly, cells may be engineered in vivo for expression of a polypeptide in vivo by, for<br>
example, procedures known in the art. For example, a producer cell for producing a retroviral<br>
particle containing RNA encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be administered to<br>
a patient for engineering cells in vivo and expression of the polypeptide in vivo. These and other<br>
methods for administering a polypeptide of the present invention by such method should be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present invention. For example, the<br>
expression vehicle for engineering cells may be other than a retrovirus, for example, an<br>
adenovirus which may be used to engineer cells in vivo after combination with a suitable<br>
delivery vehicle.<br>
Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors mentioned above may be derived<br>
include, but are not limited to, Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, spleen necrosis virus,<br>
retroviruses such as Rous Sarcoma Virus, Harvey Sarcoma Virus, avian leukosis virus, gibbon<br>
ape leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, adenovirus, Myeloproliferative Sarcoma<br>
Virus, and mammary tumor virus. In one embodiment, the retroviral plasmid vector is derived<br>
from Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus.<br>
The vector generally includes one or more promoters. Suitable promoters which may be<br>
employed include, but are not limited to, the retroviral LTR; the SV40 promoter; and the human<br>
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter described by Miller and colleagues (Biotechniques 7:980-990<br>
(1989)), or any other promoter (e.g., cellular promoters such as eukaryotic cellular promoters<br>
including, but not limited to, the histone, pol III, and b-actin promoters). Other viral promoters<br>
which may be employed include, but are not limited to, adenovirus promoters, thymidine kinase<br>
(TK) promoters, and B 19 parvovirus promoters. The selection of a suitable promoter will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings contained herein.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide of the present invention is under the<br>
control of a suitable promoter. Suitable promoters which may be employed include, but are not<br>
limited to, adenoviral promoters, such as the adenoviral major late promoter; or hetorologous<br>
promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter; the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)<br>
promoter; inducible promoters, such as the MMT promoter, the metallothionein promoter; heat<br>
shock promoters; the albumin promoter; the ApoAI promoter; human globin promoters; viral<br>
thymidine kinase promoters, such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter; retroviral<br>
LTRs (including the modified retroviral LTRs hereinabove described); the b-actin promoter; and<br>
human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter which<br>
controls the gene encoding the polypeptide.<br>
If a retroviral vector system is chosen, the retroviral plasmid vector is employed to<br>
transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which<br>
may be transfected include, but are not limited to, the PE501, PA317, b-2, b-AM, PA12, T19-<br>
14X, VT-19-17-H2, CRE, .beta.-CRIP, GP+E-86, GP+envAml2, and DAN cell lines as<br>
described by Miller (Human Gene Therapy 1:5-14 (1990)), which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The vector may transduce the packaging cells through any means known<br>
in the art. Such means include, but are not limited to, electroporation, the use of Hposomes, and<br>
CaPO4 precipitation. In one alternative, the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a<br>
liposome, or coupled to a lipid, and then administered to a host.<br>
The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include the<br>
nucleic acid sequence(s) encoding the polypeptides. Such retroviral vector particles then may be<br>
employed, to transduce eukaryotic cells, either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic<br>
cells will express the nucleic acid sequence(s) encoding the polypeptide. Eukaryotic cells which<br>
may be transduced include, but are not limited to, embryonic stem cells, embryonic carcinoma<br>
cells, as well as hematopoietic stem cells, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, myoblasts, keratinocytes,<br>
endothelial cells, and bronchial epithelial cells.<br>
These general principles apply to other viral based delivery systems, such as AAV.<br>
Polypeptide delivery<br>
The invention also provides a method of inhibiting angiogenesis comprising<br>
administering to an individual, such a human or animal a polypeptide described herein, such as<br>
the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6, or a truncated form which<br>
comprises at least one or more amino acids from the region of amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID<br>
NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of SEQ ID NO:6, in a dosage<br>
sufficient to inhibit angiogenesis.<br>
The invention also provides a method for the treatment or amelioration of disease and<br>
processes that are mediated by uncontrolled angiogenesis, comprising the step of administering<br>
to an individual, such as a human or animal, a composition comprising the polypeptide of SEQ<br>
ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6, or a truncated form which comprises at least one or<br>
more amino acids from the region of amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of<br>

This invention also provides a method for treating cancer or suppressing tumor growth<br>
comprising the step of administering to an individual, such as a human or animal, a composition<br>
comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6, or a truncated<br>
form which comprises at least one or more amino acids from the region of amino acids 1-26 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:4, amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:5, or amino acids 1-85 of SEQ ID NO:6, in a<br>
dosage sufficient to suppress tumor growth.<br>
Methods for testing the activity of a VEGI polypeptide (including a truncated form of<br>
VEGI) is well known in the art and are described in the Examples in detail, such as assay for<br>
testing effect on vascular endothelial cell growth, capillary-like tube formation, capillary growth<br>
in collagen gels placed on chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, xenograft tumor growth.<br>
As used herein, "angiogenesis associated disease" a disease or condition that is associated<br>
with undesired and/or unregulated angiogenesis, or a disease or condition for which it is<br>
advantageous to inhibit angiogenesis. It includes disease or processes mediated by undesired<br>
and/or uncontrolled angiogenesis. Examples of such angiogenesis associated diseases, such as<br>
tumor growth, are described herein.<br>
VEGI isoform polypeptides described herein may be used to inhibit the proliferation of<br>
endothelial cells, for example, aortic endothelial cells. As a result, VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b and/or<br>
VEGI-152 polypeptide can be used to treat diseases and disorders in which inhibition of<br>
endothelial cell growth is advantageous.<br>
The VEGI isoform polypeptide composition will be formulated and dosed in a fashion<br>
consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual<br>
patient (especially the side effects of treatment with VEGI isoform polypeptides alone), the site<br>
of delivery of the VEGI isoform polypeptide composition, the method of administration, the<br>
scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The "effective amount" of<br>
VEGI isoform polypeptide for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.<br>
The VEGI isoform polypeptides and agonists and antagonists of the present invention<br>
may be employed in combination with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Such compositions<br>
comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier or excipient. Such a carrier includes but is not limited to saline, buffered saline, dextrose,<br>
water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The formulation should suit the mode of<br>
administration.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more<br>
containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a<br>
governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological<br>
products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human<br>
administration. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be<br>
employed in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a convenient manner such as<br>
by the topical, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal or<br>
intradermal routes. The pharmaceutical compositions are administered in an amount which is<br>
effective for treating and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication. In general, they are<br>
administered in an amount of at least about 10 g/kg body weight and in most cases they will be<br>
administered in an amount not in excess of about 8 mg/Kg body weight per day. In most cases,<br>
the dosage is from about 10 g/kg to about 1 mg/kg body weight daily, taking into account the<br>
routes of administration, symptoms, etc.<br>
Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer VEGI isoform<br>
polypeptides of the present invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles,<br>
microcapsules, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu 1987, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, topical, intradermal,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, ophthahnic, and<br>
oral routes. The compounds may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by<br>
infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral<br>
mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other<br>
biologically active agents.<br>
In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved by,<br>
for example, and not in limitation of, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in<br>
conduction with a wound dressing, by Injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a<br>
suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or<br>
gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes or fibers.<br>
Assessment of disease is performed using standard methods in the art, such as imaging<br>
methods and monitoring appropriate markers.<br>
It will also be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that, since the VEGI isoform<br>
polypeptides of the invention are members of the TNF family the mature secreted form of the<br>
protein may be released in soluble form from the cells which express VEGI isoform polypeptides<br>
described herein by proteolytic cleavage. Therefore, when the mature form or soluble<br>
extracellular domain of VEGI isoform polypeptides is added from an exogenous source to cells,<br>
tissues or the body of an individual, the polypeptide will exert its physiological activities on its<br>
target cells of that individual. Also, cells expressing this type II transmembrane polypeptide may<br>
be added to cells, tissues or the body of an individual and these added cells will bind to cells<br>
expressing receptor for VEGI isoform polypeptides described herein, whereby the cells<br>
expressing VEGI isoform polypeptides can cause actions (e.g. regulation of endothelial cell<br>
growth and regulation) on the receptor-bearing target cells.<br>
As stated above, VEGI is shown to have strong anti-proliferation effects on endothelial<br>
cell growth. Accordingly, VEGI may also be employed to regulate the development of<br>
endothelial cells from hematopietic and circulating endothelial precursor cells.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides methods of enhancing angiogenesis comprising<br>
administering an inhibitor of VEGI-192a or VEGI-192b, such that angiogenesis is enhanced. Such<br>
enhancement may be desirable, for example, in the context of conditions associate with an<br>
obstruction of a blood vessel, such as ischemic conditions or heart attack. The formulations may<br>
be administered locally or systemically using methods known in the art.<br>
The antibody of the present invention that blocks or suppress the activity the VEGI<br>
polypeptide may be used for promoting or enhancing angiogenesis.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Described below are examples of the present invention which are provided only for<br>
illustrative purposes, and not to limit the scope of the present invention. In light of the present<br>
disclosure, numerous embodiments within the scope of the claims will be apparent to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples,<br>
however, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to such examples.<br>
The discovery of an endothelial cell-specific gene product, vascular endothelial cell<br>
growth inhibitor (VEGI) has recently been reported (Zhai Y, et al, FASEB J., 13:181-189,<br>
1999; Zhai, Y, et al, Int. J. Cancer, 82:131-136,1999). The protein consists of 174-amino<br>
acids, i.e., VEGI-m, with a 20-30% sequence homology to members of the TNF superfamily.<br>
Northern blotting analysis of a wide variety of cell lines and primary cell cultures indicates that<br>
the VEGI-174 gene is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells. Additionally, the VEGI-174<br>
mRNA is detectable in many adult human organs, suggesting a physiological role of the gene in<br>
a normal vasculature. The function of VEGI-174 was examined in a number of cellular and<br>
animal models. Recombinant truncated form of VEGI-174 inhibited endothelial cell proliferation<br>
with a remarkable potency, but had no effect on the growth of any other types of cells examined.<br>
The truncated form of the protein also inhibited the formation of capillary-like structures by<br>
endothelial cells in collagen gels, and the growth of capillaries into collagen gels placed on the<br>
chick chorioallantoic membrane. Overexpression of a secreted form of VEGI-174 in murine colon<br>
cancer cells (MC-38) nearly completely prevented these cells from growing tumors in syngenic<br>
C57/BL mice. Moreover, co-inoculation of human breast cancer cells with Chinese hamster<br>
ovary cells overexpressing secreted form of VEGI-174 led to marked inhibition of the growth of<br>
the breast cancer xenograft tumors in nude mice.<br>
Example 1. ELISA analysis of human sera:<br>
Normal human sera of normal male and female adult individuals are obtained from the<br>
Lombardi Cancer Center serum bank. Sandwich ELISA was used to measure serum VEGI<br>
content. Serum samples (100 Âµl) or varying amounts of recombinant VEGI protein in 3% BSA<br>
were added to 96-well plates coated with a polyclonal anti-VEGI antibody and blocked with 3%<br>
BSA. A monoclonal antibody (100Âµl, 2 Âµg/ml) against VEGI (3-12D) was added. Biotinylated<br>
anti-mouse IgG antibody (2Âµg/ml, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added, followed by<br>
avidin-horseradish peroxidase, with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (Vector laboratories) as<br>
substrate. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction terminated<br>
with 50 Âµl 1M H2SO4, then analyzed at 450 nm with a spectrophotometric plate reader, using the<br>
standard curve y= -0.72 + 0.409*log(x). Standard protein range used was 0.32 - 1000 ng/ml.<br>
Example 2. Northern blotting:<br>
Multi-tissue Northern blots and multi-tissue dot-blot panels (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA)<br>
were hybridised in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) with double-stranded cDNA probes. The full<br>
length VEGI-174 probe used was a Hind III- BamHI cDNA fragment (GenBank Accession<br>
#AF03990) in pCDNA3.1 (Invtrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For isoform-specific probes, a 297-bp<br>
VEGI-251 template encoding its N-terminal 99 amino acids was made by PCR amplification, and<br>
labeled wth 32P-dCTP by random priming (Life Technologies.Invitrogen, CA). The VEGI-174<br>
specific probe corresponding to its N-terminal 22 amino acids was made by end-labeling a 66-bp<br>
PCR product. The blots were hybridized at 42 Â°C overnight and washed in wash buffer 1 (2 X<br>
SSC, 0.1% Sodium lauryl sulfate) and wash buffer 2 (1 X SSC, 1% SDS) at 42Â° C followed by<br>
autoradiography at -70 Â°C with an intensifying screen.<br>
Example 3. 5'RACE and VEGI isoform cloning:<br>
5' VEGI sequences were amplified from a multi-tissue RACE panel (ORIgene,<br>
Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This panel contains cDNA samples<br>
prepared from 24 individual human tissues, with an adapter ligated to the 5' ends of the cDNAs.<br>
Two rounds of nested PCR were performed using two pairs of oligonucleotide primers. In the<br>
first round of PCR, an adapter primer ADP1, 5' CGGAATTCGT CACTCAGCG 3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO:8) and a VEGI gene-specific primer GSP1, 5'CCCGGATCCT ATAGTAAGAA GGCTCC<br>
3' (SEQ ID NO:9) were used. The reaction products were then diluted 1:10 with water. The<br>
diluted PCR samples were then used for the second round of PCR with another adapter primer,<br>
ADP2,5' AGCGCGTGAA TCAGATCG3' (SEQ ID NO:10), and a VEGI gene-specific primer,<br>
GSP2,5' CGGTGGATCC CGAGTTTGTC TCACAACTG3' (SEQ ID NO:11). The PCR<br>
products were resolved on an agarose gel, purified, and sequenced on an ABI automatic<br>
sequencer.<br>
Example 4. Isolation of VEGI 251 and VEGI-192a:<br>
Gene-specific primers designed according to sequencing results of the RACE products<br>
were used to repeat the second round PCR to confirm their sequence identities. The gel-purified<br>
RACE products were then cloned into plasmid pCR3.1 (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD) and<br>
sequenced. Based on these sequences, isoform-specific primers were designed. The shared<br>
reverse primer, Vgl61 (161), 5'GTGTAATCCA CCAAAGAG3' (SEQ ID NO:12) was used<br>
with forward primers listed in Table 8.<br>
Example 5. Cell Culture and TNFa Treatment:<br>
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE), and fetal bovine heart endothelial<br>
(FBHE) cells were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and grown in EGM-2<br>
(Clonetics). Human dermal microvascular endothelial (HMVE), human coronary artery<br>
endothelial (HCAE) cells and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture<br>
Collection and grown in EGM2-MV (Clonetics). Adult bovine aortic endothelial (ABAE) cells,<br>
and mouse brain endothelioma bEND.3 were gifts from Dr Peter Bohlen of ImClone Inc, New<br>
York, NY. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASM) (Clonetics) and ABAE cells<br>
were cultured in IMEM (Bioftuids, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA), 10% FBS, 1 ng/ml<br>
fibroblast growth factor-2 (Promega, Madison,WI). EA.Hy926, a human endothelial-derived cell<br>
line, was a gift from Dr Cora-Jean Edgell, University of North Carolina. These cells, together<br>
with mouse brain bEND.3 and heart H5V endothelioma cell lines, were maintained in IMEM<br>
with 10% FBS. Subconfiuent cells grown in 100-mm dishes were treated with various doses of<br>
tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) prior to RNA analysis.<br>
Example 6. Ribonuclease protection assays:<br>
For isoform-specific probes, cDNA fragments from human VEGI-174 (862-1062bp),<br>
VEGI-251 (1-160 bp), VEGI-192a (277-656 bp), were generated by PCR and inserted between the<br>
EcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in the antisense direction. A mouse Ã-actin probe<br>
(824-942) was cloned into pSP72 (Promega) between the HindIII and BamIII sites. The VEGI<br>
and Ã-actin templates were linearized with Hindlll and EcoRI, respectively. Antisense run-off<br>
probes were synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase using the Maxiscript transcription kit<br>
(Ambion, Woodward TX). For nuclease protection with the RPAIII kit (Ambion, TX), 15-20 Âµg<br>
of total RNA was hybridised overnight with 1-3 x 105 cpm of each probe at 52 Â°C. RNase<br>
digestion was performed with 1:100 dilution of RNase A/T1 mix (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 Â°C.<br>
The products of digestion were precipitated, resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and subjected<br>
to autoradiography at -70 Â°C.<br>
Example 7. Gene structure analysis:<br>
The organization of the human VEGI gene was analyzed by PCR using a bacterial<br>
artificial chromosome (BAC) clone (Genome Systems, Inc, St Louis, MO). PCR primers from<br>
exonic sequences were designed which generated overlapping PCR products. These PCR<br>
products were sequenced to determine their relative positions. Primers for the intronic region<br>
were designed based the GenBank entry for Chromsome 9 Contig NT_017568, which<br>
correspond to sequences between bases 2,643,881 and 2,694,724. These are listed in Table 9.<br>
With human placenta DNA as a template, extra long PCR was performed using an rTth XL PCR<br>
kit from Perkin Elmer (Foster City, CA) and the following extra long PCR conditions: 95Â°C, 1<br>
min, 97Â°C, 15 sec, 60.5Â°C, 10 min, 17 cycles; 97Â°C, 15 sec, 60.5Â°C, 10 min plus 15 sec<br>
extension, 13 cycles, followed by final extension at 72Â°C for 11 min. The PCR fragments were<br>
generated with the primer pairs shown in Table 9. The PCR products were sequenced.<br>
Example 8. Expression plasmids and transient transfections:<br>
The open reading frames of VEGI-174 and VEGI-251 were inserted into pcDNA3.1-myc<br>
(Invitrogen, MD) to generate peptides bearing a C-terminal myc tag. The resultant plasmids were<br>
transfected into ABAE and HUVE cells for cellular localization studies. For cell transfections, 3<br>
x 104 cells were seeded on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (Nalge, Naperville, IL) overnight.<br>
Plasmid DNA (400 ng) in 25 Âµl serum-free IMEM was mixed with PLUS reagent (4 ul)<br>
(GIBCO-BRL). LipofectAMINE (GIBCO) reagent (1 ul) was 200-fold and mixed with the DNA<br>
solution for 15 mins. The DNA-lipofectAMINE complex was then added to cells with 200 Âµl<br>
IMEM and incubated at 37 Â°C for 3 h. The cells were allowed to recover in serum-containing<br>
growth medium for 36 h prior to immuno-staining and subsequent fluorescence microscopy. The<br>
full length coding region of VEGI-174 or VEGI-251 was also inserted between the EcoR1 and<br>
BamH1 sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) to make GFP-VEGI fusion proteins. The GFP-VEGI<br>
fusion constructs were transfected into ABAE cells as described above. At 48 h post-<br>
transfection, the cellular localization of the fusion protein were examined by fluorescence<br>
microscopy.<br>
Example 9. Immunostaining for subcellular localization:<br>
Transfected adult bovine aortic (ABAE) and HUVE cells were washed with PBS and<br>
fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde/0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with<br>
0.5% Triton X-l 00 in PBS for 5 mins, then incubated with a 1:300 dilution of an anti-myc<br>
monoclonal antibody 9-10E (Sigma) for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated<br>
with anti-mouse IgG, Texas Red-conjugated monoclonal antibody at a 1:60 dilution (Jackson<br>
ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc West Grove, PA), then washed thrice with PBS. The cells were<br>
visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70-SIF).<br>
Example 10. Production of monoclonal antibodies:<br>
Six-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA )<br>
were injected subcutaneously with purified recombinant VEGI protein (residues 29-174) at 50 Âµg<br>
per mouse in 0.1 ml of a complete Freud's adjuvant ( Life Technologies). Following<br>
intraperitoneal boosters, mice with higher titers received a final intraperitoneal antigen injection<br>
of 30 Âµg/mouse. Spleen cells were isolated and fused with mouse myeloma SP2/O cells, using<br>
polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridomas were selected by HAT medium<br>
and screened by ELISA. Positive hybridomas were cloned and the subclass of monoclonal<br>
antibodies was determined using the mouse isotype kit (SIGMA, MO). Hybridomas were<br>
cultured on an INTEGRA CL 350 (INTEGRA Biosciences, Inc., Iiamsville, MD), the<br>
supematants collected, and monoclonal antibodies were purified by AffiGel protein A agarose<br>
(Bio-Rad).<br>
Example 11. Production of polyclonal antibodies:<br>
Four to six-month-old SPF New Zealand White rabbits (Charles River) were inoculated<br>
subcutaneously with 100 Âµg of E. coli expressed recombinant VEGI (as above) mixed with<br>
complete Freud's adjuvant (Life Technologies). Following intramuscular boosters, serum was<br>
collected from rabbits showing substantial immune response. Sera was purified by absorption<br>
with E. coli (transformed with an empty expression vector) cell lysate, then with human coronary<br>
artery smooth muscle cell lysate.<br>
Example 12. Analysis of VEGI in mammalian cells and conditioned media:<br>
The full-length VEGI-251 coding region was inserted between the Hind III and BamHI<br>
sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). These pcDNA3 plasmids, including vector, were transfected into<br>
MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells by electroporation. Stable transfectants were selected in 2<br>
mg/ml G418 sulfate (GIBCO). Conditioned media were concentrated with Centricon columns<br>
(MW cutoff 10,000). Both cell lysates and conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with<br>
protein A/G agarose (Oncogene, Boston, MA) and the polyclonal antibody against VEGI. The<br>
samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Detection was effected with a 1:1000 dilution of<br>
mouse monoclonal antibodies 1-8F, and visualized with anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated<br>
with horseradish peroxidase (ECL kit, Amersham).<br>
Example 13. Lentiviral gene transfer:<br>
The lentiviral vectors containing VEGI-174, sVEGI and VEGI-251 were prepared using<br>
previously described methods (Dull, et al. J Virol 72, 8463-8471,1998; Naldini, et al Proc Natl<br>
AcadSci (USA) 93,11382-11388,1996; Naldini, et al. Science 272,263-267,1996; Stewart, et<br>
al. Proc Natl AcadSci (USA) 96,12039-12043. 1999). Briefly, the lentiviral vector was<br>
generated in 293T cells with 3 plasmids : the transducing plasmid pHR'CMV-VEGI, the<br>
packaging plasmid pCMV AR8.2 Avpr and the envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G. Viral<br>
supernatants were collected every 24 h from two days post-transfection, purified by 0.45 urn<br>
filtration and titrated by p24 assay (Dull, et al. J Virol 72, 8463-8471,1998; Naldini, et al. Proc<br>
Natl Acad Sci (USA) 93,11382-11388,1996; Naldini, et al. Science 272,263-267,1996;<br>
Stewart, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 96,12039-12043.1999). One pg of p24 count was<br>
defined as one tissue culture infective dose (TCID). For cell toxicity assays, HUVE cells were<br>
plated at a density of 2 x 104 per well in a 24-well plate 20 h before infection with viral<br>
supernatant. The cell number was expected to double 20 h after plating. Increasing doses of viral<br>
vector were added to HUVE cells. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was estimated as TCID<br>
per cell at the time of infection. The number of adherent cells remaining in culture 24 h after<br>
viral infection were determined by Coulter Counter.<br>
Example 14. In vivo tumorigenicity assay:<br>
Stably transfected MDA-MB-231 cells containing empty pcDNA3 vector, VEGI-174,<br>
VEGI-251 or sVEGI were injected into mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (1x106<br>
cells/injection). There were 2 injection sites per animal and 15 animals in each group which<br>
received the VEGI-174, VEGI-251 and sVEGI transfectants. A group of 5 animals injected with<br>
pcDNA3 vector transfectants was used as control. The sizes of the resultant xenograft tumors<br>
monitored in a blinded manner. Determination of microvessel density was carried out as<br>
described (Weidner, et al N Engl J Med 324,1-8,1991). Briefly, intratumor microvessels were<br>
immunostained with rat anti-mouse CD31 (PECAM-1) monoclonal antibody (clone MEC13.3,<br>
Pharmingen International, San Diego, CA). The antibody was diluted 1:100 in PBS, incubated<br>
overnight with 5 Âµm paraffin-fixed tumor sections, and visualized with a biotinylated anti-rat<br>
IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories) by the Vectastain ABC method (Vector Laboratories). Each<br>
sample was examined under low power (x10 objective lens and xlO ocular lens) to identify the<br>
most vascular areas of the tumor ("hot spots", see reference (Weidner, et al. N Engl J Med 324,<br>
1-8, 1991)). Within these areas, a maximum of 10 fields at x 400 magnification (x40 objective<br>
and xlO ocular lens; 0.16 mm2 per field) were examined, and the mean values calculated. Large<br>
vessels with muscular walls were excluded. The lumen was not required to identify a vessel. Any<br>
positively stained endothelial cells or cell clusters, clearly separate from adjacent microvessel,<br>
tumor cells and connective tissue elements, were regarded as distinct countable microvessels. All<br>
measurements were performed in a blinded manner. The results were analyzed by one-way<br>
analysis of variance (ANOVA). The apriori level of significance was set at P-value of less than<br>
0.05.<br>
Example 15. Detection of VEGI protein in human sera<br>
As an initial screen to determine whether VEGI exists in a soluble form, we analyzed a<br>
human serum bank of healthy adults with monoclonal antibodies. We were able to detect, by<br>
ELISA with an antibody against the C-terminus, VEGI concentrations ranging between 1 and 10<br>
ng/ml (Figure 1). This indicated that, in addition to the previously characterized VEGI which<br>
was believed to be membrane-bound, a soluble form of VEGI would also be of significant<br>
physiological relevance. Since previous studies had shown apoptotic activity of a recombinant C-<br>
terminal peptide, and overexpression of the full length VEGI-174 was ineffective on xenograft<br>
tumors formed by transfected cancer cells, we thus reasoned that the C-terminus-containing<br>
soluble peptide found in human sera was not likely to have been derived from VEGI-174. This<br>
observation then prompted us to propose that the VEGI gene might express alternate forms in<br>
human tissue.<br>
Example 16. Detection of multiple VEGI transcripts and cloning of novel VEGI isoforms<br>
With a full length cDNA of the originally discovered human VEGI as a probe, Northern<br>
blots of normal human tissues consistently revealed multiple bands of the following sizes: 7.5kb,<br>
2.0 kb and 1.5 kb (Figure 2). These multiple transcripts for VEGI showed somewhat overlapping<br>
tissue distribution and demonstrated the existence of a VEGI family. In order to elucidate the<br>
structure of the VEGI-related transcripts, we undertook the isolation of VEGI isoforms by PCR.<br>
With VEGI-specific 3' primers, 5' RACE was employed to amplify 5' ends of VEGI messages<br>
from a number of human tissues. The RACE products were then cloned into pCR3.1 and<br>
sequenced (Figure 3). Sequence analysis revealed two novel VEGI sequences, VEGI-251 and<br>
VEGI-192a (Table 8 and Figure 3). Based on these 5' sequences, isofoim-specific primers were<br>
designed, and full-length cDNA clones isolated from arrayed cDNA panels. Three VEGI<br>
isoforms were thus isolated from fetal brain, adult uterus and lung (Figures 3A and B). The novel<br>
cDNAs contain open reading frames of 251 and 192 amino acids (Figure 3B), with calculated<br>
molecular weights of 28 086 and 21 952 Daltons respectively. The two novel VEGI peptides,<br>
VEGI-2S1 and VEGI-192a, share the carboxyl 151 amino acid residues with the original VEGI<br>
(Zhai, etal. IntJ Cancer 82,131-136,1999), now referred to as VEGI-174. The hydropathic<br>
profile of the proteins indicated a hydrophobic region of 20 amino acid residues in VEGI-251 near<br>
its N-terminus (Figure 3B) which is absent from VEGI-174 and VEGI-192a- This sequence was<br>
predicted to comprise a signal peptide. Another highly hydrophobic, possibly transmembrane<br>
region, was previously identified at the N-terminus of VEGI-174 (Figure 3B).<br>
Example 17. Expression of VEGI isoforms<br>
The individual expression patterns of the isoforms was further examined by Northern<br>
analysis with multi-tissue blots. A 7.5 kb VEGI-251 transcript was detected in placenta, kidney,<br>
lung and liver while the 2 kb VEGI-174 transcript was observed in liver, kidney, skeletal muscle<br>
and heart (Figure 4). When these same probes were used on a multi-tissue RNA dot blot, it was<br>
observed that, in addition to overlapping expression between VEGI 251 and 174 in prostate,<br>
salivary gland and placenta, VEGI-251 was more abundant than VEGI-174 in fetal kidney and fetal<br>
lung, while VEGI-174 is more abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, adrenal gland, and<br>
liver (Table 10). The significance of such expression patterns is at present not readily apparent to<br>
us. VEGI-192a mRNA could not be readily detected by Northern blotting because of its low<br>
abundance.<br>
VEGI expression in vitro was also examined by RNase protection assay. In agreement<br>
with previous observations for VEGI-174, VEGI-251 and VEGI-192a were detected in the same cell<br>
types as VEGI-174, being present in human endothelial cells, including coronary artery<br>
endothelial (HCAE), human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) and human microvascular<br>
endothelial (HMVE) cells and undetectable in human coronary artery smooth muscle (HCASM),<br>
ABAE and mouse endotheliomas bEND.3 (Figure 5). It should also be noted that more than one<br>
isoform was expressed in the same cell type, with VEGI-251 being the most abundant. This<br>
suggests that the expression of these isoforms plays a regulatory role in VEGI function.<br>
Example 18. Human VEGI gene organization<br>
In order to determine the structural relationship of the three VEGI transcripts, the<br>
organization of the human VEGI gene was analyzed. This was done with a BAC clone as well as<br>
with genomic DNA isolated from human placenta samples. It was found that the human VEGI<br>
gene spans over 17 kb, with 4 exons and 3 introns (Figure 6). The intron-exon junctions conform<br>
to the GT-AG rule. Based on the size of fragment 2, intron 1 was estimated at 13-15 kb, although<br>
sequence information could not be obtained from this PCR product. All three isoforms share a<br>
common 438 bp region encoding residues 29-174 of VEGI-174 (Table 12) encoded by exon IVb<br>
(Figure 6), but their 5' regions are generated from alternative exon usage. Interestingly, VEGI-251<br>
and VEGI-192a utilize exonic splice acceptor sites to generate their respective products (Table<br>
11). Ribonuclease protection and 5' RACE studies using genomic probes and HUVE RNA<br>
indicated that the putative transcription initiation site for VEGI-251 is located about 100 bp<br>
upstream of its ATG (unpublished, Chew LJ) but those for VEGI-174 and VEGI-192a have yet to<br>
be mapped. Due to the very low abundance of VEGI-192a RNA, subsequent studies were focused<br>
on VEGI-251. While it is presently unclear whether all the isoforms initiate at the same promoter,<br>
we nonetheless reasoned that the significance of generating multiple transcripts could lie in<br>
differential regulation of synthesis, which in turn may point toward the relative importance of<br>
one particular VEGI isoform.<br>
Organization of the human VEGI gene, with the size of each exon and approximate sizes of<br>
introns. Exon numbers are given in Figure 6. Uppercase letters indicate exon sequence, and<br>
lower case indicate intron sequence. Consensus splice junctions are underlined. * The extreme 5'<br>
ends of VEGI-192a and VEGI-174 mRNA have not yet been identified, therefore intron-exon<br>
junctions in these regions are unknown.<br>

Example 19. VEGI isoform transcripts are induced in parallel by TNFa<br>
To test for the possibility of differential regulation in VEGI isoform transcription, VEGI<br>
gene regulation using an anti-angiogenic paradigm of TNFa treatment was analyzed. Although<br>
many studies describe anti-proliferative effects of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFa on<br>
endothelial cells, these cytokines can also be angiogenic depending on dose and system used (see<br>
Discussion). Such modulatory effects on endothelial cells may serve to regulate the levels of an<br>
endothelial cell-specific cytokine such as VEGI. We found that concentrations of 15 ng/ml of<br>
TNFa or higher could induce an increase in VEGI RNA levels in both large vessel (umbilical<br>
vein) and small vessel (dermal microvascular) endothelial cells (Figure 7), and that all isoforms<br>
were induced in both these endothelial cell types. It is also clear that VEGI-251 remains the most<br>
abundant of the isoforms. The parallel upregulation of VEGI transcripts by TNFa not only<br>
indicates that VEGI-mediated activity is potentially a target of TNFa action, but also that the<br>
control of VEGI function through the synthesis of multiple peptides most likely lies at the post-<br>
transcriptional level.<br>
Example 20. Subcellular localization<br>
Since TNF-like peptides are often present as both membrane-bound and soluble forms,<br>
the possibility by using recombinant VEGI-transfected ABAE cells was investigated.<br>
Localization experiments were performed with constructs bearing a myc tag at the C-termini of<br>
VEGI coding regions (Figure 8). Expression constructs of VEGI isoforms in pcDNA3.1-myc<br>
were transfected into ABAE cells and the distribution of the VEGI-myc product analyzed by<br>
immunocytochemistry with an anti-myc antibody. VEGI-174 was detected in the cell with<br>
endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-like distribution (Figure 8A). However, VEGI-251 showed a more<br>
restricted peri-nuclear granular staining (Figure 8B). In both cases, cell surface localization was<br>
not apparent by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In HUVE cells, the VEGI-251-myc-containing<br>
vesicles were found not to be Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells, because the myc signal<br>
did not colocalize with von Willebrand factor (vWF) staining (Figure 8C). It is therefore possible<br>
that, in contrast with vWF, processing of VEGI-251 does not involve a regulated secretory<br>
pathway in endothelial cells.<br>
To determine whether the isoforms might exhibit N-terminus directed differences in<br>
subcellular localization, chimeric GFP-VEGI expression constructs were made with both full-<br>
length VEGI and their corresponding unique N-terminal sequences. These constructs, with GFP<br>
tags at their N-termini (Figure 8), were transiently transfected into ABAE cells. As shown in<br>
Figures 8E through 8 J, with the exception of 8G, the distribution of GFP-VEGI was distinct from<br>
that of untargeted GFP. Full length VEGI-174 showed localization in ER/Golgi, as previously<br>
seen with myc-tagged VEGI-174 while the first 22 residues of VEGI-174 appeared inadequate for<br>
targeting GFP distribution to a specific intracellular organelle (Figure 8G). In contrast, the first<br>
99 amino acids of VEGI-251 was sufficient to result in GFP localization in vesicles which abutted<br>
the plasma membrane. This distribution was seen as a fluorescent band that outlined the cellular<br>
boundary (Figures 8H through J). Our observations suggested that VEGI-251 might be located in<br>
secretory vesicles which underwent constitutive exocytosis.<br>
Unlike GFP-VEGI-251, the lack of plasma membrane localization of VEGI-251-myc<br>
(Figure 8B) strongly suggested that the C-terminal myc tag was lost from the cell, possibly<br>
because of cleavage of the secretory signal and secretion of the soluble C-terminal fragment. It<br>
was known that true signal sequences that were placed downstream of the N-termini, such as in<br>
GFP-VEGI-251 and GFP-VEGI-1-99, were not cleaved during synthesis in the ER. This<br>
difference in distribution patterns of VEGI-251 with C-terminal and N-terminal tags was in<br>
agreement with a secretory mechanism that involved cleavage of VEGI-251 at or within its N-<br>
terminal sequence prior to release into the extracellular milieu.<br>
Example 21. Demonstration of VEGI in cell-conditioned media<br>
Given the hydrophobic residues in the N-terminus of VEGI-251 and its observed<br>
subcellular distribution, it appears likely that VEGI-251 is a secreted protein. To test this<br>
hypothesis, stable transfectants of VEGI-251 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were generated.<br>
As a negative control, transfectants of pcDNA3 vector were also made. Expression of the<br>
constructs in MDA-MB-231 was confirmed by RNase protection assay. It should be noted that<br>
the survival and proliferation of these cells in vitro was not affected by either vector or VEGI<br>
transfection. The conditioned media of the MB-231 transfectants was collected, concentrated and<br>
immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal VEGI antibody and subjected to Western analysis with an<br>
anti-VEGI monoclonal antibody 3-12D. Our results revealed a protein of molecular weight of<br>
about 25 kD (Figure 9A). The appearance of the doublet cannot be readily explained, but may be<br>
the result of alternate glycosylation or other post-translational modification of the recombinant<br>
peptide in transfected MB231 cells. No VEGI protein was detected in media from untransfected<br>
cells or cells bearing the empty pcDNA3 vector (Figure 9A). VEGI-174 could not be detected in<br>
conditioned medium under similar experimental conditions (not shown). In a separate<br>
experiment, Western analysis of concentrated HUVE cell-conditioned medium also revealed a<br>
band of similar molecular weight as that obtained with VEGI-251 transfectants, as did HUVE<br>
cell-conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody (Figure 9B). These<br>
observations indicate that VEGI-251 is not membrane-bound but is instead a secreted protein.<br>
Example 22. Overexpression of VEGI-251 in endothelial cells causes cell death<br>
In order to test the biological activity of VEGI-251 on endothelial cells, a lentivirus gene<br>
delivery system was selected to transfect HUVE cells with VEGI expression constructs. The<br>
lentiviral gene delivery was first tested with a GFP construct and confirmed that over 90%<br>
HUVE cells could be transduced (not shown). Our observations with VEGI-174, VEGI-251 and the<br>
secreted form of VEGI with the IL6 signal peptide, sVEGI, showed that only the secreted forms<br>
of VEGI, including VEGI-251 and sVEGI, were cytotoxic to HUVEC (Figure 10 A), while VEGI-<br>
174 was without effect. These results indicate that HUVE cells bear membrane receptors for<br>
VEGI that can become activated via an autocrine mechanism.<br>
Example 23. Anti-tumor activity of VEGI-251<br>
It has been previously shown that a recombinant form of VEGI-174 carrying the IL-6<br>
secretory signal peptide, sVEGI, was effective in inhibiting the growth of MC38 colon<br>
carcinoma tumors in vivo (Zhai, et al. Int J Cancer 82,131-136,1999). Since native VEGI-251 is<br>
a secreted protein, we determined whether it could also inhibit the growth of human xenograft<br>
tumors in vivo. Fifteen lines of stably transfected MDA-MB-231 clones for each construct were<br>
selected, with five lines from vector-transfected controls. Cells from each group were pooled and<br>
injected into mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice. Tumor volumes were determined<br>
as a function of time after injection. Similarly pooled cell cultures of VEGI-174 and sVEGI-<br>
transfected clones were compared. Pooled vector-transfected clones were used as controls.<br>
Untransfected parental cells were also assayed and were found to be identical with the vector-<br>
transfected clones.<br>
Our results show that overexpression of full length VEGI-174 by cancer cells had little<br>
effect on the growth of the xenograft tumors (Figure 10B). However, overexpression of the intact<br>
VEGI-251 as well as the sVEGI fusion protein retarded tumor growth significantly. These<br>
observations are in complete agreement with the effect of lentiviral transfection in vitro (Figure<br>
10 A), confirming the biological activity of native VEGI-251.<br>
We then determined the effect of full-length VEGI-251 overexpression by cancer cells on<br>
tumor neovascularization. Tumor-associated microvessel density was found to be significantly<br>
reduced with the expression of VEGI-251. The extent of reduction was comparable to that in<br>
sVEGI overexpressing tumors. Since the sVEGI fusion protein consists of the secretion signal<br>
peptide of IL6 and residues 23-174 of VEGI-174, the results indicate that residues 23-174 contained<br>
the biological equivalent of native VEGI-251. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that<br>
secretion of VEGI-251 into the extracellular matrix is necessary for its anti-tumor activity. In<br>
addition, similar to sVEGI, this anti-tumor activity of VEGI-251 is not due to a direct effect on<br>
tumor cells, but rather to interference with the development of tumor-associated vasculature.<br>
Example 24. Identification of potential isoforms of VEGI<br>
It is observed that, when a Northern blot membrane of human tissues was analyzed with a<br>
VEGI cDNA probe, a multiple number of mRNA bands appear in different tissues (Fig. 11).<br>
Since the experimental conditions used in these experiments did not favor non-specific binding<br>
of the probes, and judging from the approximate sizes of the mRNA molecules, there were at<br>
least three isoforms corresponding to 7.5 kb, 2.0 kb, and 1.5 kb, respectively. The different<br>
distribution of these isoforms in various tissues suggested that they play different physiological<br>
roles.<br>
Example 25. Confirmation of the novel VEGI isoforms<br>
Using Rapid Amplification of cDNA End (RACE) (commercially available from<br>
OriGene Technology, Rockville, MD), a panel of cDNA libraries representing various human<br>
tissues was used to search for the VEGI isoforms. This panel contains cDNA samples prepared<br>
from 24 individual human tissues, with an adapter ligated to the 5' end of each cDNA molecule.<br>
A gene-specific oligonucleotide primer (GSP) corresponding to part of VEGI cDNA and an<br>
adapter primer (ADP) were used to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fig 12). Two<br>
rounds of nested PCR were performed using two pairs of oligonucleotide primers. After first<br>
round PCR (94Â°C 3 min, 4 cycles of 94Â°C for 30sec, 65Â°C for 30 sec, 72Â°C for 2 min; 16 cycles<br>
of 94Â°C for 30 sec, 60Â°C for 30 sec, 72Â°C for 2 min; then 72Â°C for 6 min) with an adapter primer<br>
(ADP1, 5'-CGGAATTCGT CACTCAGCG-3') (SEQ ID NO:8) and a VEGI gene specific<br>
primer (GSP1,5'-CCCGGATCCT ATAGTAAGAA GGCTCC-3') (SEQ ID NO:9), the<br>
reaction products were diluted 1:10 with water. The diluted PCR samples were used in the<br>
second round PCR (94Â°C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 sec; 54Â°C for 30 sec, 72Â°C for 2<br>
min; then 72Â°C for 6 min) with another adapter primer (ADP2, 5'-AGCGCGTGAA<br>
TCAGATCG3') (SEQ ID NO:10) and a VEGI gene specific primer (GSP2, 5'-CGGTGGATCC<br>
CGAGTTTGTC TCACAACTG 3') (SEQ ID NO:11). The PCR products were fractionated on<br>
an agarose gel. Positive DNA fragments were excised from the gel, purified for sequencing<br>
analysis. Four PCR products with different lengths were obtained from different tissues (Fig.<br>
13). These PCR products were subjected to DNA sequencing, confirming that the nucleotide<br>
sequences of these PCR products were different from each other. These isoforms are now named<br>
as VEGI-174, VEGI-192a, VEGI-192b, and VEGI-251, according to the number of amino acid<br>
residues in the proteins encoded by these cDNA molecules.<br>
Example 26. Cloning of full-length cDNA of the isoforms<br>
Gene specific primers designed according to sequencing results of the PCR products<br>
obtained from the RACE experiments described above were used to repeat the second round<br>
PCR to confirm the specificity of their sequences. The purified RACE products were then<br>
cloned into plasmid pCR 3.1 of Invitrogene (San Diego, CA) to prepare high quality DNA<br>
samples for sequencing. Based on the presence of an in-frame stop codon and an initiation codon<br>
in the 5'-sequence of VEGI192a and VEGI192b, the full-length cDNA molecule of VEGI192a was<br>
constructed with two pairs of nested PCR primers: Vg3A: 5 '-AATCTCACCT GTCTCTGCCT<br>
G-3' (SEQ ID NO:43) and Vg-3'-1: 5'-CTAAACCGTT GTCCCTGTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO:44);<br>
Vg3B: 5'-CCTGTAAAAA TGGTTATAGT AG-3' (SEQ ID NO:45) and Vg-3'-2: 5'-<br>
GGTGGCAGAG GACTTTC-3' (SEQ ID NO:46). The full-length cDNA.molecule of VEGI192b<br>
was constructed with primer vg4b 5'-CTCTACTTAC GCCAAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO:47) and<br>
primer JY2 5'-CCCGGATCCT ATAGTAAGAA GGCTCC-3' (SEQ ID NO:48). The cDNA<br>
libraries from which the isoforms were identified was used for the PCR. Both VEGI192a and<br>
VEGI192b were cloned into pCR3.1 of Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Since no in frame translation<br>
initiation codon could be found in the 5' sequence of VEGI251, a pair of gene specific primers<br>
vg5B: 5'-CACCACATAC CTGCTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO:49) and vgl61: 5'-GTGTAATCCA<br>
CCAAAGAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 12), were used to isolate a full-length VEGI251 cDNA clone from<br>
Arrayed cDNA Library Panels of OriGene (Rockville, MD). The cDNA sequence of VEGI-192a<br>
is shown in Table 13.<br>

Example 27. Anti-angiogenic and anticancer activity of VEGI251<br>
A recombinant protein made of a truncated form of VEGI174, consisting of residues 29-<br>
174, is a potent inhibitor of tumorigenesis (Zhai Y, ef al, FASEB J., 13: 181-189,1999; Zhai, Y,<br>
et al., Int. J. Cancer, 82:131-136,1999). It is shown that VEGI has no direct effect on the<br>
growth of the cancer cells, and that the mechanism of action of VEGI in the inhibition of tumor<br>
growth is to inhibit the formation of blood vessels in the tumors. Therefore the full-length<br>
cDNA of VEGI251 was transfected into a human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, then<br>
implanted in the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice to show that the gene product<br>
was able to inhibit the growth of tumors by these cells. In order to inhibit the growth of the<br>
endothelial cells in the immediate surroundings of the cancer cells, it is necessary for the VEGI<br>
gene product to be released into the outside of the transfected cells. It was demonstrated that a)<br>
that the gene product could be found in the conditioned media of the transfected cells in culture,<br>
and b) the transfected cells could grow tumors in the nude mice.<br>
The MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were transfected with either the empty vector, the<br>
full-length VEGI-174 cDNA, the full-length VEGI-251 cDNA, or with a fusion gene in which the<br>
VEGI protein was linked to a secretion signal peptide derived from interleukin-6 (IL6/VEGI).<br>
When analyzed by Western blotting, using a monoclonal antibody (13-2D) to VEGI, the gene<br>
product of VEGI-251 was found in the conditioned media of the transfected cells (Fig. 14). In<br>
contrast, the gene product of the VEGI-174 was not detectable in the conditioned media.<br>
The stably transfected MDA-MB-231 clones were injected into the mammary fat pads of<br>
athymic female nude mice (1 x 106 cells per injection). The tumor sizes were determined as a<br>
function of time. Microvessel density in the tumor was also analyzed. The overexpression of full<br>
length VEGI-174 by the cancer cells had little effect on the growth of the xenograft tumors, and<br>
over-expression of the secreted form of the putative VEGI extracellular domain and the full<br>
length VEGI-251 markedly inhibited tumor growth (Fig. 15). Furthermore, it was demonstrated<br>
that the VEGI protein was available in the tumors by carrying out immunohistochemical analysis<br>
of the tumor sections using a monoclonal antibody to VEGI. Some of the tumors (G9-1R) had<br>
cancer cells that produced a remarkable amount of VEGI-251, while others had cancer cells that<br>
produced little VEGI-251 (G9-2R), as compared with tumors formed by vector-transfected cells<br>
(G10-2R) (Fig. 16). The more VEGI-251 produced by the tumors, the slower was the growth rate<br>
of the tumors (Fig. 17). These findings show that that VEGI-251 is secreted by the transfected<br>
cancer cells, and that the secreted VEGI-251 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth by inhibiting<br>
the growth of the endothelial cells in the surroundings. In contrast, VEGI-174 is not secreted by<br>
the cells, and consequently, cannot inhibit the growth of the endothelial cells.<br>
Example 28. Tissue Distribution of VEGI expression<br>
Unlike other members of the TNF family, VEGI-174 is specifically expressed in<br>
endothelial cells. Northern blotting analysis of total RNA preparations from 23 cell lines and<br>
primary cell cultures showed that VEGI was only detected in HUVE and human venous<br>
endothelial cells (Fig. 18). VEGI-174 was also not seen in human artery endothelial cells. Using<br>
multiple tissue Northern blots, the VEGI-174 transcript was found in many adult human tissues,<br>
including placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, prostate, small intestine, and<br>
colon (Fig. 18), suggesting that the gene product may play a role in the function of a normal<br>
vasculature.<br>
Example 29. Specific inhibition of endothelial cell growth by VEGI<br>
A truncated version of VEGI-174 was generated corresponding to the putative<br>
extracellular domain consisting of residues 39-174. The protein was expressed in E. coli, purified<br>
to apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and examined in<br>
a variety of cellular assays. The truncated protein was able to specifically inhibit the<br>
proliferation of adult bovine aortic endothelial (ABAE) cells (Fig. 19). Nearly complete<br>
inhibition of the growth of the endothelial cells was achieved at 10 Âµg/ml, with a half-maximum<br>
inhibitory concentration value (IC50) of about 1 Âµg/ml (about 70 nM). In contrast, the protein<br>
had no effect on the growth of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435)<br>
under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 19). VEGI also did not inhibit the proliferation of<br>
human T-cell leukemia cells (Jurkat), human Burkitts lymphoma cells (Raji), human monocytic<br>
leukemia cells (THP-1), or human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60), cells that are often<br>
responsive to the cytotoxic activity of the TNFs. The potency of VEGI appeared to be lower<br>
than what might be expected from a cytokine; however, it is comparable to that of known protein<br>
inhibitors of angiogenesis such as angiostatin and endostatin, as well as the CD40 ligand,<br>
(another TNF-family member). The relatively low potency of the truncated VEGI observed may<br>
also be partly due to an un-optimized truncation site, or the lack of post-translational<br>
modification, such as glycosylation, since the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli.<br>
Example 30. Up-regulation of VEGI gene in confluent endothelial cells<br>
The endothelial cell-specific inhibitory activity of VEGI indicates that the protein acts as<br>
a negative regulator of angiogenesis. To show that the VEGI gene is down-regulated in<br>
proliferating endothelial cells but up-regulated when the cells are quiescent, the expression of<br>
VEGI in cultured HUVE cells was examined by Northern blotting (Fig. 20). Low levels of<br>
VEGI mRNA were seen in newly seeded HUVE cells; however, as the cell number increases in<br>
the cultures, the VEGI mRNA level increases accordingly, and reaches a plateau when the cell<br>
cultures become confluent.<br>
Example 31. Inhibition of capillary-like tube formation by endothelial cells cultured on<br>
collagen gels<br>
The anti-angiogenic activity of the truncated VEGI was examined with an in vitro<br>
angiogenesis model (Montesano, R. &amp; Oorci, L., Cell 42:469,1985)). Endothelial cells cultured<br>
on the surface of a three-dimensional collagen gel form a quiescent monolayer when the culture<br>
reached confluence. Upon stimulation of the monolayer cells with an angiogenic factor such as<br>
FGF-2, however, the cells invaded into the gel and form capillary-like tubular structures in the<br>
gel. The tube-formation can be inhibited by anti-angiogenic factors. The extent of the tube<br>
formation can be quantitatively assessed by using computer-assisted image analysis (Li, L. Y.,<br>
Biochemistry 33:10999,1994). The truncated VEGI-m was able to inhibit the formation of<br>
capillary-like tubes by ABAE cells (Fig. 21). The IC50 value for the inhibition was<br>
approximately 1 Âµg/ml, similar to that observed for the inhibition of endothelial cell growth.<br>
Example 32. Inhibition of capillary growth in collagen gels placed on chick embryo<br>
chorioallantoic membrane<br>
The antiangiogenic activity of VEGI-174 was further demonstrated by using a modified<br>
chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (Nguyen, M. et al, Microvasc. Res.<br>
47:31,1994). The method is based on the growth of new capillary vessels into a collagen gel<br>
pellet placed on the CAM. Blood vessels were stimulated to grow vertically into a polymerized<br>
collagen gel in the presence of an angiogenic factor, such as FGF-2 or VEGF, embedded in the<br>
gel. The inhibitor was incorporated into the gels in order to determine its effect on the capillary<br>
growth. The extent of angiogenesis in the gel was assessed by the use of FITC-dextran injected<br>
into the circulation of the CAM. The recombinant VEGI-174 (5.0 Âµg/ml) inhibited about 50% of<br>
the new capillary growth into the collagen gels induced by FGF-2 (2.0 Âµg/ml) (Fig. 22).<br>
Example 33. Inhibition of breast cancer xenograft tumor growth by co-injected CHO cells<br>
overexpressing VEGI<br>
The anticancer activity of VEGI is demonstrated with a xenograft tumor model, using<br>
breast cancer cells that are highly tumorigenic when implanted into the mammary fat pads of<br>
female athymic nude mice. A secreted form of VEGI-174 is constructed by replacing the<br>
N-terminal and the putative transmembrane segments of VEGI-174 (residues 1-25) with the<br>
secretion signal peptide derived from human interleukin-6. The secreted VEGI-174 construct was<br>
cloned into an eucaryotic expression vector, which was then transfected into Chinese hamster<br>
ovary (CHO) cells. Expression of the corresponding construct was confirmed by Northern blot<br>
analysis. Secretion of the modified VEGI by the transfected cells was confirmed by the ability<br>
of the conditioned medium to inhibit ABAE cell growth. The transfected CHO cells were then<br>
mixed with human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435), and the cell mixtures<br>
were injected into the mammary fat pads of nude mice. The growth of the xenograft tumors<br>
were monitored following injection. Despite the high tumorigenicity of the breast cancer cell<br>
lines used, a marked inhibition of the growth of the xenograft tumors formed by either the MDA-<br>
MB-231 (Fig. 23A) or the MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 23B) was observed. In a repeat of the<br>
experiment using the MDA-MB-435 cells, the co-injection also led to complete inhibition of<br>
tumor formation. The vector-transfected CHO cells had no effect on tumor growth in either<br>
case. Since VEGI did not inhibit the growth of these breast cancer cells in culture, the anticancer<br>
activity of the protein arised from its antiangiogenic activity.<br>
Example 34. Inhibition of ABAE cell proliferation by VEGI-ma<br>
Full length VEGI-192a was expressed in E. coli and refolded and purified using method<br>
described in U.S. Pat. Appl. 20010044521 and PCT WO 01/55174. Specifically, an expression<br>
vector (PET11, Novagen) containing a polynucleotide insert which encodes full length VEGI-192a<br>
polypeptide was constructed. The expression vector was transformed into E. coli and the<br>
transformed E. coli were grown to express the VEGI-192a polypeptide. The cells were harvested<br>
and inclusion bodies were purified from the disrupted cells. The OD280 of the solution<br>
containing the inclusion bodies was adjusted to pH 5.0 with the 8 M urea solution. The final<br>
solution contained the following reducing reagents: 10 mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, 10 mM DTT<br>
(Dithiothreitol), 1 mM reduced glutathion (GSH), 0.1 mM oxidized glutathion (GSSG). The<br>
final pH of the solution was 10.0. The above solution was rapidly diluted into 20 volumes of 20<br>
mM TRISâ¢ base, the pH was adjusted to 9.0, and then slowly adjusted to 8.0 with 1 M HC1, by<br>
adjusting pH to 8.8 for twenty four hours, then 8.6 for twenty four hours, etc., until the pH was<br>
8.0. Alternatively, the proteins could be refolded using dialysis. The OD280 of the 8 M urea<br>
solution was adjusted to 0.5, and dialyzed against 20 volumes of TRISâ¢ base. The pH of the<br>
solution was again slowly adjusted to 8.0. The refolded material was then concentrated by<br>
ultrafiltration, and separated by gel filtration, for example, on a SEPHACRYLâ¢ S-300 column<br>
equilibrated with 20 mM TRISâ¢, HC1,0.4 M urea, pH 8.0. The S-300 fractions could be<br>
checked by running a non-reduced SDS-PAGE. The wrongly refolded protein ran at a very high<br>
molecular weight, while properly refolded proteins ran at a normal molecular weight.<br>
The VEGI-192a proteins from S-300 fractions were tested for its ability to inhibit<br>
endothelia cell growth. Adult bovine aortic endothelial (ABAE) cells were seeded in triplicate at<br>
8,000 cells/well in 24-well plates, in IMEM (GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD), 10% fetal calf serum.<br>
FGF-2 (1 ng/ml) was added to the media. The cultures were maintained at 37Â°C, 5%CO2, for 6<br>
days. The cells were then trypsinized, and the number of cells determined by using a Coulter<br>
(Hialeah, FL) counter.<br>
As shown in Figure 24, properly folded VEGI-192a, but not misfolded VEGI-192a, from S-<br>
300 fractions was able to inhibit the growth of ABAE cells. Nearly half-complete inhibition of<br>
the growth of the endothelia cells was achieved at 1000 ng/ml, with a half-maximum inhibitory<br>
concentration value (IC50) at about 10 ng/ml.<br>
