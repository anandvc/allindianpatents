Patent Application No.IN/PCT/2001/00373.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates 10 certain substituted 3-cyano quinoline.-compounds as<br>
well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the present<br>
invention inhibit the action of certain growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases<br>
(PTK) and other protein kinases thereby inhibiting the abnormal growth of certain<br>
cell types. The compounds of this invention are therefore useful for the treatment of<br>
certain diseases that are the result of deregulation of these PTKs. The compounds of<br>
this invention are anti-cancer agents and are useful for the treatment of cancer in<br>
mammals. In addition, the compounds of this invention are useful for the treatment<br>
of polycystic kidney disease in mammals. This invention also relates to the<br>
manufacture of said 3-cyano quinolines, their use for the treatment of cancer and<br>
polycystic kidney disease, and the pharmaceutical preparations containing them.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a<br>
phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue located on a protein substrate.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases clearly play a role in normal cell growth. Many of the growth<br>
factor receptor proteins function as tyrosine kinases and it is by this process that they<br>
effect signaling. The interaction of growth factors with these receptors is a necessary<br>
event in normal regulation of cell growth. However, under certain conditions, as a<br>
result of either mutation or overexpression, these receptors can become deregulated;<br>
the result of which is uncontrolled cell proliferation which can lead to tumor growth<br>
and ultimately to the disease known as cancer [Wilks A.F., Adv. Cancer Res., 60, 43<br>
(1993) and Parsons, J.T.; Parsons, S.J., Important Advances in Oncology, DeVita<br>
V.T. Ed., J.B. Lippincott Co., Phila., 3 (1993) ]. Among the growth factor receptor<br>
kinases and their proto-oncogenes that have been identified and which are targets of<br>
the compounds of this invention are the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase<br>
(EGF-R kinase, the protein product of the erbB oncogene). and the product produced<br>
by the erbB-2 (also referred to as the neu or HER2) oncogene. Since the<br>
phosphorylation event is a necessary signal for cell division to occur and since<br>
overexpressed or mutated kinases have been associated with cancer, an inhibitor of<br><br>
this event, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, will have therapeutic value for the<br>
treatment of cancer and other diseases characterized by uncontrolled or abnormal cell<br>
growth. For example, overexpression of the receptor kinase product of the erbB-2<br>
oncogene has been associated with human breast and ovarian cancers [Slamon, D. J.,<br>
et. al., Science, 244, 707 (1989) and Science, 235 , 1146 (1987)]. Deregulation of<br>
EGF-R kinase has been associated with epidermoid tumors [Reiss, M, et. al., Cancer<br>
Res., 51, 6254 (1991)], breast tumors [Macias, A., et. al., Anticancer Res., 7, 459<br>
(1987)], and tumors involving other major organs [Gullick, W.J., Brit. Med. Bull., 47,<br>
87 (1991)]. Because of the importance of the role played by deregulated receptor<br>
kinases in the pathogenesis of cancer, many recent studies have dealt with the<br>
development of specific PTK inhibitors as potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents<br>
[some recent reviews: Burke. T.R., Drugs Future, 17, 119 (1992) and Chang, C.J.;<br>
Geahlen, R.L., J. Nat. Prod., 55, 1529 (1992)]. The compounds of this invention<br>
inhibit the kinase activity of EGF-R and are therefore useful for treating certain<br>
disease states, such as cancer, that result, at least in part, from deregulation of this<br>
receptor. The compounds of this invention are also useful for the treatment and<br>
prevention of certain pre-cancerous conditions, such as the growth of colon polyps,<br>
that result, at least in part, from deregulation of this receptor.<br>
It is also known that deregulation of EGF receptors is a factor in the growth of<br>
epithelial cysts in the disease described as polycystic kidney disease [Du J., Wilson P.<br>
D., Amer. J. Physiol, 269(2 Pt 1), 487 (1995); Nauta J., et al., Pediatric Research .<br>
37(6), 755 (1995); Gattone V.H., et al., Developmental. Biology, 169(2), 504 (1995);<br>
Wilson P.D., et al., Eur. J. Cell Biol., 61(1), 131, (1993)]. The compounds of this<br>
invention, which inhibit the catalytic function of the EGF receptors, are consequently<br>
useful for the treatment of this disease.<br>
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a major pathway in<br>
the cellular signal transduction cascade from growth factors to the cell nucleus. The<br>
pathway involves kinases at two levels: MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), and their<br>
substrates MAP kinases (MAPK). There are different isoforms in the MAP kinase<br>
family. (For review, see Rony Seger and Edwin G. Krebs, FASEB, Vol. 9, 726, June<br>
1995). The compounds of this invention can inhibit the action of two of these<br><br>
kinases: MEK, a MAP kinase kinase, and its substrate ERK, a MAP kinase. MEK is<br>
activated by phosphorylation on two serine residues by upstream kinases such as<br>
members of the raf family. When activated, MEK catalyzes phosphorylation on a<br>
threonine and a tyrosine residue of ERK. The activated ERK then phosphorylates<br>
and activates transcription factors in the nucleus, such as fos and jun, or other cellular<br>
targets with PXT/SP sequences. ERK, a p42 MAPK is found to be essential for cell<br>
proliferation and differentiation. Over-expression and/or over-activation of Mek or<br>
ERK has been found to be associated with various human cancers (For example,<br>
Vimala S. Sivaraman, Hsien-yu Wang, Gerard J. Nuovo, and Craig C. Malbon, J.<br>
Clin. Invest. Vol. 99, No. 7 April 1997). It has been demonstrated that inhibition of<br>
MEK prevents activation of ERK and subsequent activation of ERK substrates in<br>
cells, resulting in inhibition of cell growth stimulation and reversal of the phenotype<br>
of ray-transformed cells (David T. Dudley, Long Pang, Stuart J. Decker, Alexander J.<br>
Bridges, and Alan R. Saltiel, PNAS, Vol. 92, 7686, August 1995). Since, as<br>
demonstrated below, the compounds of this invention can inhibit the coupled action<br>
of MEK and ERK, they are useful for the treatment of diseases such as cancer which<br>
are characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and which, at least in part, depend<br>
on the MAPK pathway.<br>
Epithelial Cell Kinase (ECK) is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK)<br>
belonging to the EPH (Erythropoietin Producing Hepatoma) family. Although<br>
originally identified as an epithelial lineage-specific tyrosine kinase, ECK has<br>
subsequently been shown to be expressed on vascular endothelial cells, smooth<br>
muscle cells, and fibroblasts. ECK is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with the<br>
extracellular ligand-binding domain consisting of a cysteine-rich region followed by<br>
three fibronectin type III repeats. The intracellular domain of ECK possesses a<br>
tyrosine kinase catalytic domain that initiates a signal transduction cascade reflecting<br>
the ECK function. ECK binds and is subsequently activated by its counter-receptor,<br>
Ligand for Eph-Related Kinase (LERK)-1, which is an immediate early response<br>
gene product readily inducible in a lineage-unrestricted manner with proinflammatory<br>
cytokines such as EL-1 or TNF. Soluble LERK-1 has been shown to stimulate<br>
angiogenesis in part by stimulating ECK in a murine model of corneal angiogenesis.<br><br>
Unlike their normal counterparts, tumor cells of various lineages constitutively<br>
express LERK-1 and this expression can further be upregulated by hypoxia and<br>
proinflammatory cytokines. Many of these tumor cells also express ECK at higher<br>
levels than their normal counterparts, thereby creating an opportunity for autocrine<br>
stimulation via ECK : LERK-1 interaction. The increased expression of both ECK<br>
and LERK-1 has been correlated with the transformation of melanomas from the<br>
noninvasive horizontal phase of growth into very invasive vertically growing<br>
metastatic melanomas. Together, the ECK : LERK-1 interaction is believed to<br>
promote tumor growth via its tumor growth promoting and angiogenic effects. Thus,<br>
the inhibition of the ECK tyrosine kinase activity mediating signaling cascade<br>
induced by its binding and cross-linking to LERK-1 may be therapeutically beneficial<br>
in cancer, inflammatory diseases, and hyperproliferative disorders. As is shown<br>
below, the compounds of this invention inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of ECK<br>
and are therefore useful for the treatment of the aforementioned disorders.<br>
Growth of most solid tumors is dependent on the angiogenesis involving<br>
activation, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells and their<br>
subsequent differentiation into capillary tubes. Angiogenization of tumors allows<br>
them access to blood-derived oxygen and nutrients, and also provides them adequate<br>
perfusion. Hence inhibiting angiogenesis is an important therapeutic strategy in not<br>
only cancer but also in a number of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and so on. Tumor<br>
cells produce a number of angiogenic molecules. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor<br>
(VEGF) is one such angiogenic factor. VEGF, a homodimeric disulfide-linked<br>
member of the PDGF family, is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen and is known to<br>
cause profound increase in the vascular endothelial permeability in the affected<br>
tissues. VEGF is also a senescence-preventing survival factor for endothelial cells.<br>
Almost all nucleated tissues in the body possess the capability to express VEGF in<br>
response to various stimuli including hypoxia, glucose deprivation, advanced<br>
glycation products, inflammatory cytokines, etc. Growth-promoting angiogenic<br>
effects of VEGF are mediated predominantly via its signaling receptor Kinase insert<br>
Domain containing Receptor (KDR). The expression of KDR is low on most<br><br>
endothelial cells; however, activation with angiogenic agents results in a significant<br>
upregulation of KDR on endothelial cells. Most angiogenized blood vessels express<br>
high levels of KDR. KDR is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase with an extracellular<br>
VEGF-binding domain consisting of 7 immunoglobulin-like domains and a<br>
cytoplasmic domain containing the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain split by a kinase -<br>
insert region. Binding to VEGF causes dimerization of KDR resulting in its<br>
autophosphorylation and initiation of signaling cascade. Tyrosine kinase activity of<br>
KDR is essential for mediation of its functional effects as a receptor for VEGF.<br>
Inhibition of KDR-mediated functional effects by inhibiting KDR's catalytic activity<br>
is considered to be an important therapeutic strategy in the treatment of angiogenized<br>
disease states including cancer. As is shown below, the compounds of this invention<br>
inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of KDR and are therefore useful for the treatment<br>
of the aforementioned disease states.<br>
In addition to the above utilities some of the compounds of this invention are<br>
useful for the preparation of other compounds of this invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention are certain substituted 3-cyano quinolines.<br>
Throughout this patent application, the quinoline ring system will be numbered as<br>
indicated in the formula below; the numbering for the quinazoline ring system is also<br>
shown:<br><br>
No 3-cyano quinolines have been reported that have biological activity as<br>
inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases. A 3-cyano quinoline with a 4-(2-methyI<br>
anilino) substituent having gastric (H+/K+)-ATPase inhibitory activity at high<br>
concentrations has been described [Ife R.J., et al., J. Med. Chem., 35(18), 3413<br>
(1992)].<br>
There are quinolines that do not have the 3-cyano substituent and, unlike the<br>
compounds of this invention, are unsubstituted at the 4-position but are reported to be<br>
inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases [Gazit A., et al.,, J. Med. Chem., 39(11), 2170<br><br>
(1996)]. A series of quinolines that have a 3-pyridyl substituent and no substituent at<br>
the 4-position have been described as inhibitors of platelet derived growth factor<br>
receptor kinase [Dolle R.E., et al., J. Med. Chem., 372, 2627 (1994) and Maguire<br>
M.P., et al., J. Med. Chem., 372,129 (1994)]. The patent applications WO 96/09294<br>
and WO-9813350 describe inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases that include 4-<br>
anilino quinolines with a large variety of substituents on positions 5-8 but which must<br>
also have a hydrogen or fluorine atom at position 3. The US patent 5,480,883<br>
describes quinoline derivatives that are inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases but these<br>
derivatives do not have the unique combination of substituents, including the 3-cyano<br>
group, contained in the compounds of the present invention. The applications WO-<br>
9802434 and WO-9802438 describe quinoline derivatives that are tyrosine kinase<br>
inhibitors but these quinolines do not have the important 3-cyano substituent.<br>
In addition to quinolines, certain quinazoline derivatives that are similar, in<br>
some respects, to the compounds of this invention are known to be inhibitors of<br>
protein tyrosine kinases. The application EP-520722 describes 4-anilinoquinazolines<br>
that contain simple substituents such as chloro, trifluoromethyl, or nitro groups at<br>
positions 5 to 8. The application EP-566226 is similar but with a much larger variety<br>
of substituents now allowed at positions 5 to 8. The application WO-9609294<br>
describes compounds with similar substituents at positions 5 to 8 and with the<br>
substituent at to 4-position consisting of some polycyclic ring systems. Some simple<br>
substituted quinazolines are also described in the applications WO-9524190, WO-<br>
9521613, and WO-9515758. The applications EP-602851 and WO-9523141 cover<br>
similar quinazoline derivatives where the aryl group attached at position 4 can be a<br>
variety of heterocyclic ring structures. The application EP-635498 describes certain<br>
quinazoline derivatives that have alkenoylamino and alkynoylamino groups among<br>
the substituents at position 6 and a halogen atom at position 7. The application<br>
WO-9519774 describes compounds where one or more of the carbon atoms at<br>
positions 5-8 can be replaced with heteroatoms resulting in a large variety of bicyclic<br>
systems where the left-hand ring is a 5 and 6-membered heterocyclic ring; in<br>
addition, a variety of substituents are allowed on the left-hand ring. The application<br>
EP-682027-A1 describes certain pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitors of PTKs. The<br><br>
application WO-9519970 describes compounds in which the left-hand aromatic ring<br>
of the basic quinazoline structure has been replaced with a wide variety of different<br>
heterocyclic rings so that the resulting inhibitors are tricyclic. The application<br>
EP-635507 describes quinazolines where an additional 5 or 6-membered heterocyclic<br>
ring with optional substitution is fused at positions 5 and 6.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned patent applications, a number of<br>
publications describe 4-anilinoquinazolines: Fry, D.W., et. al., Science, 265, 1093<br>
(1994), Rewcastle G.W., et. al., J. Med. Chem., 38, 3482 {1995), and Bridges, A.J.,<br>
et al., J. Med. Chem., 39 , 267, (1996). There are no publications that describe 3-<br>
cyano quinolines as PTK inhibitors.<br>

FLOWSHEET 1<br><br>
The preparation of the compounds of this invention encompassed by Formula 12 is<br>
described below in Flowsheet 2 where X, Z, n, R1, G2, G3, and R4 are as described<br><br>
above. The substituted aniline of Formula 6 is heated with or without a solvent with<br>
the reagent 7 to give intermediate 8 as a mixture of isomers. Thermolysis of 8 in a<br>
high boiling solvent such as diphenyl ether at 200-350°C gives the 3-cyano<br>
quinolones of Formula 9; these intermediates may also exist in the. 4-hydroxy<br>
quinoline tautomeric form. In those cases where R, is a hydrogen atom, the<br>
intermediates 9 may be formed as a mixture of two regipisomers. These isomers can<br>
be separated by methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, fractional<br>
crystallization and chromatographic methods. The separated isomers can then be<br>
converted separately to the compounds of the invention. Alternatively, the isomers<br>
can be separated at a later stage of the synthesis. Heating compounds 9 with or<br>
without solvent with a chlorinating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride or<br>
phosphorous pentachloride gives the 4-chloro-3-cyano quinolines of Formula 10.<br>
Condensation of 10 with a nucleophilic amine, aniline, mercaptan, thiophenol,<br>
phenol, or alcohol reagent of Formula 11 gives the 3-cyano quinolines intermediates<br>
of Formula 12; this condensation can be accelerated by heating the reaction mixture<br>
or by using basic catalysts such as trialkylamines, sodium hydride in an inert solvent,<br>
sodium or potassium alkoxides in an alcohol solvents, and the like. In those cases<br>
where the substituents may contribute an asymmetric carbon atom, the intermediates<br>
can be used as the racemate or as the individual R or S entantiomers in which case the<br>
compounds of this invention will be in the racemic or R and S optically active forms,<br>
respectively. In cases where the substituents may contribute more than one<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms, diasteriomers may be present; these can be separated by<br>
methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, fractional crystallization<br>
and chromatographic methods. In those cases where R1, G2, G,, and R4 moieties<br>
contain primary or secondary amino groups, the amino groups may first have to be<br>
used in protected form prior to reaction with reagent 7. Suitable protecting groups<br>
include, but are not limited to, tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) and benzyloxycarbonyl<br>
(CBZ) protecting groups. The former protecting group can be removed from the final<br>
products of Formula 12 by treatment with an acid such as trifluoroactic acid while the<br>
latter protecting group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation. In those cases<br>
where the R1, G2, G3, and R4 moieties contain hydroxyl groups, the hydroxyl groups<br><br>
may first have to be used in protected form prior to reaction with reagent 7. Suitable<br>
protecting groups include, but are not limited to, t-butyldimethylsilyl, tetrahydro-<br>
pyranyl, or benzyl protecting groups. The first two protecting groups can be removed<br>
from the final products of formula 12 by treatment with an acid such as acetic acid or<br>
hydrochloric acid while the latter protecting group can be removed by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
FLOWSHEET 2<br><br><br>
The preparation of intermediate 15 (identical to intermediate 9 of Flowsheet<br>
2) can also be prepared as describe below in Flowsheet 3. Heating the substituted<br>
aniline of Formula 13 with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal with or without a<br>
solvent gives intermediates for Formula 14. The reaction of 14 with the lithium anion<br>
of acetonitrile prepared using a base such as n-butyl lithium or the like in an inert<br>
solvent gives the 3-cyano quinolones, 15, or the 3-cyano-4-hydroxy quinoline<br>
tautomers thereof which can be converted to the compounds of this invention. In<br>
those cases where R1, G2, G1, and R4 moieties contain primary or secondary amino<br>
groups, the amino groups may first have to be used in protected form. Suitable<br>
protecting groups include, but are not limited to, tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) and<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) protecting groups. The former protecting group can be<br>
removed from the final products of Formula 15 by treatment with an acid such as<br>
trifluoroactic acid while the latter protecting group can be removed by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation. In those cases where the R1, G2, G1, and R4 moieties contain hydroxyl<br>
groups, the hydroxyl groups may first have to be used in protected form. Suitable<br>
protecting groups include, but are not limited to, t-butyldimethylsilyl, tetrahydro-<br>
pyranyl, or benzyl protecting groups. The first two protecting groups can be removed<br>
from the final products of formula 15 by treatment with an acid such as acetic acid or<br>
hydrochloric acid while the latter protecting group can be removed by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation.<br><br><br>
The preparation of the compounds of this invention encompassed by Formula 24 is<br>
described below in Flowsheet 4 wherein R1, G2, R4, Z, n, and X are defined. R10 is<br>
alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms (preferably isobutyl). R2' is a radical selected from the<br>
group consisting of:<br><br><br>
wherein R6, R3, R5, J, s, r, u, and v are defined. According to the reactions outlined<br>
in Flowsheet 4, a 4-chloro-3-cyano-6-nitroquinoline, 16, can be reacted with an<br>
amine or aniline 17 by heating in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, butanol, or<br>
methoxyethanol to give compounds of Formula 20 where Z is -NH-. The reaction of<br>
16 with a mercaptan or thiophenol 18 in an inert solvent can be accomplished using a<br>
base such as sodium hydride to give compounds of Formula 20 where Z is -S-. The<br>
reaction of 16 with a alcohol or phenol 19 in an inert solvent can be accomplished<br>
using a base such as sodium hydride to give compounds of Formula 20 where Z is<br>
-O-. Compounds of Formula 20 can be reduced to a 6-amino-3-cyano-quinoline, 21,<br>
using a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite in a two phase system consisting<br><br>
of tetrahydrofuran and water in the presence of a small amount of phase transfer<br>
catalyst or by using iron in refluxing protic solvents containing acetic acid or<br>
ammonium chloride. Acylation of 21 with either an acid chloride of Formula 22 or a<br>
mixed anhydride of Formula 23 (which is prepared from the corresponding<br>
carboxylic acid) in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the presence of<br>
an organic base such as pyridine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, or N-methyl<br>
morpholine gives the compounds of this invention of Formula 24. In those cases<br>
where 22 or 23 have an asymmetric carbon atom, they can be used as the racemate or<br>
as the individual R or S entantiomers in which case the compounds of this invention<br>
will be in the racemic or R and S optically active forms, respectively. In those cases,<br>
where the R2' contains primary or secondary amino groups, the amino groups will<br>
first have to be protected prior to anhydride or acid chloride formation. Suitable<br>
protecting groups include, but are not limited to, tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) and<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) protecting groups. The former protecting group can be<br>
removed from the final products of Formula 24 by treatment with an acid such as<br>
trifluoroactic acid while the latter protecting group can be removed by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation. In those cases where the R2' contains hydroxyl groups, the hydroxyl<br>
groups may first have to be protected prior to anhydride or acid chloride formation.<br>
Suitable protecting groups include, but are not limited to, t-butyldimethylsilyl,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, or benzyl protecting groups. The first two protecting groups can be<br>
removed from the final products of Formula 24 by treatment with an acid such as<br>
acetic acid or hydrochloric acid while the latter protecting group can be removed by<br>
catalytic hydrogenation. In those cases, in intermediates 17, 18, or 19 where X<br>
contains primary or secondary amino groups or hydroxyl groups, it may be necessary<br>
to protect these groups prior to the reaction with 16. The same amine or alcohol<br>
protecting groups describe above can be used and they can be removed from the<br>
products 24 as previously described.<br><br><br>
By using methods similar to that describe above in Flowsheet 4, the intermediates 25<br>
can be converted to the compounds of this invention, 26.<br><br><br>
In order to prepare the compounds of this invention, certain amines are required.<br>
Some representative amines are shown below in List A wherein R6, p, and r are as<br>

be used as the racemate or they can be resolved and used as the individual R or S<br>
entantiomers in which case the compounds of this invention will be in the racemic or<br>
optically active forms, respectively. Throughout this application in the Flowsheets<br>
shown below, these alcohols, and other similar alcohols, will be represented by the<br>
generic structure of the formula:<br>
R'OH<br><br><br>
In order to prepare some of the compounds of this invention certain mixed<br>
anhydrides of Formulas 31, 34, and 38 are required; these are prepared as outlined<br>
below in Flowsheet 5-6 wherein R6. R10, X, Z, n, and s are as defined above. J' is a<br>
halogen atom chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or is a toslyate (p-toluenesulfonate) or<br>
mesylate (methanesulfonate) group. The reaction of 27 with an araine of List A is<br>
accomplished by heating in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, or using potassium or cesium carbonate in acetone. The<br>
temperature and duration of the heating will depend on the reactivity of 27; longer<br>
reaction times and higher temperatures may be required when s is greater than 1.<br>
Treatment of 28 with an alkyl lithium reagent followed by quenching with an<br>
atmosphere of dry carbon dioxide furnishes the carboxylic acids of formula 29. These<br>
can be converted to mixed anhydrides of Formula 31 using a reagent such as<br>
isobutylchloroformate in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a<br>
base such as N-methylmorpholine. These anhydrides can then be used to prepare the<br>
compounds of this invention as described above in Flowsheet 4. The reaction of 27<br>
with an alcohol of List B is accomplished using sodium hydride or other non-<br>
nucleophic base such as potassium or cesium carbonate in an inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetone, or N,N-dimethylformamide. In some cases, the alcohol of<br>
List B can also be the solvent of the reaction. Treatment of 32 with an alkyl lithium<br>
reagenl followed by quenching with an atmosphere of dry carbon dioxide furnishes<br>
the carboxylic acids of formula 33. These can be converted to mixed anhydrides<br>

tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base such as N-methylmorpholine. These<br>
anhydrides can then be used to prepare the compounds of this invention as described<br>
above in Flowsheet 4.<br><br><br>
As outline in Flowsheet 6 below wherein R1, G2, R4, R6, R10. X, Z, n, and s<br>
are as defined above, alcohols 35 can be protected with a t-butyl dimethysilyl<br>
protecting group by the reaction with the respective silyl chloride in methylene<br>
chloride in the presence of triethylamine and 4-N,N-dimethylamino pyridine<br>
(DMAP). The resulting protected alcohols, 36, are converted to the acetylenic<br><br>
Grignard reagents which, in turn, are maintained under an atmosphere of dry carbon<br>
dioxide to give the carboxylic acids 37. As described above these are converted to the<br>
mixed anhydrides 38 which on reaction with the 6-amino3-cyanoquinoline 39 gives<br>
40. In the final step of the sequence, the silyl protecting group is removed by treating<br>
with acid in a protic solvent mixture to give the compounds represented by Formula<br>
41.<br><br><br>
Compounds of this invention are also prepared as shown below in Flowsheet 7<br>
wherein R1, G2, R4, R6, R10. X, Z, n, and s are as defined above. J' is a halogen<br>
atom chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or is a toslyate or mesylate group. Treatment of 42<br>
with an alkyl lithium reagent at low temperature followed by quenching with an<br>
atmosphere of dry carbon dioxide furnishes the carboxylic acids of formula 43. These<br>
can be converted to mixed anhydrides of Formula 44 using a reagent such as<br>
isobutylchloroformate in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a<br>
base such as N-methylmorpholine. These anhydrides can then be used to prepare the<br>
compounds of this invention as by the reaction with the 6-amino-3-cyanoquinolines<br>
45 described above in the Flowsheets. The reaction of 46 with an alcohol of List B is<br>
accomplished using sodium hydride or other non-nucleophic base in an inert solvent<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide to give the compounds of this<br>
invention represented by 47. In some cases, the alcohol of List B can also be the<br>
solvent of the reaction. The reaction of 46 with an amine of List A gives the<br>
compounds of this invention represented by 48 is accomplished by heating in an inert<br>
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide, or using potassium or<br>
cesium carbonate in acetone. The temperature and duration of the heating will depend<br>

hydroxide to give the respective carboxylic acid 50, 54, or 58. These acid can be<br>
converted to the respective carboxylic acid chlorides 51 or 56 by using oxalyl<br>
chloride and catalytic N,N-dimethylformamide in an inert solvent or respective mixed<br>
anhydrides 55 or 59 by using isobutyl chloroformate and an organic base such as N-<br>

In addition to the methods described herein above, there a number of patent<br>
applications that describe methods that are useful for the preparation of the<br>

Representative compounds of this invention were evaluated in several<br>
standard pharmacological test procedures that showed that the compounds of this<br>
invention possess significant activity as inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, and are<br>
antiproliferative agents. Based on the activity shown in the standard pharmacological<br>
test procedures, the compounds of this invention are therefore useful as antineoplastic<br>
agents. The test procedures used and results obtained are shown below.<br>
Inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase (EGF-R)<br>
using recombinant enzvme<br>
Representative test compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the<br>
phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of a peptide substrate catalyzed by the<br>
enzyme epidermal growth factor receptor kinase. The peptide substrate (RR-SRC)<br>
has the sequence arg-arg-leu-ile-glu-asp-ala-glu-tyr-ala-ala-arg-gly. The enzyme used<br>
in this assay is the His-tagged cytoplasmic domain of EGFR. A recombinant<br>
baculovirus (vHcEGFR52) was constructed containing the EGFR cDNA encoding<br>
amino acids 645 -1186 preceded by Met-Ala-(His)6. Sf9 cells in 100 mm plates were<br>
infected at an moi of 10 pfu/cell and cells were harvested 48 h post infection. A<br>
cytoplasmic extract was prepared using 1% Triton X-100 and applied to Ni-NTA<br>
column. After washing the column with 20 mM imidazole, HcEGFR was eluted<br>
with 250 mM imidazole (in 50 mM Na2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). Fractions<br>
collected were dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol,<br>
1ug/mL antipain and leupeptin and 0.1 mM Pefabloc SC. The protein was frozen in<br>
dry ice/methanol and stored -70°C.<br><br>
Test compounds were made into 10 mg/mL stock solutions in 100%<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Prior to experiment, stock solutions were diluted to 500<br>
uM with 100% DMSO and then serially diluted to the desired concentration with<br>
HEPES buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.4).<br>
For the enzyme reaction, 10 uL of each inhibitor (at various concentrations)<br>
were added to each well of a 96-well plate. To this was added 3 uL of enzyme (1:10<br>
dilution in 10mM HEPES, pH 7.4 for final cone, of 1:120). This was. allowed to sit<br>
for 10 min on ice and was followed by the addition of 5 l peptide (80 M final<br>
cone), 10 l of 4X Buffer (Table A), 0.25 L "P-ATP and 12 L H2O. The reaction<br>
was allowed to run for 90 min at room temperature and was followed by spotting the<br>
entire volume on to precut P81 filter papers. The filter discs were washed 2X with<br>
0.5% phosphoric acid and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation<br>
counter.<br><br><br>
The inhibition data for representative compounds of the invention are shown<br>
below in TABLE 1. The IC50 is the concentration of test compound needed to reduce<br>
the total amount of phosphorylated substrate by 50%. The % inhibition of the test<br>
compound was determined for at least three different concentrations and the IC50<br>
value was evaluated from the dose response curve. The % inhibition was evaluated<br>
with the following formula:<br>
% inhibition = 100 - [CPM(drug)/CPM(control)] x 100<br>
where CPM(drug) is in units of counts per minute and is a number expressing the<br>
amount of radiolabled ATP (g-33P) incorporated onto the RR-SRC peptide substrate<br>
by the enzyme after 90 minutes at room temperature in the presence of test compound<br>
as measured by liquid scintillation counting. CPM(control) is in units of counts per<br>
minute and was a number expressing the amount of radiolabled ATP (g-33P)<br>
incorporated into the RR-SRC peptide substrate by the enzyme after 90 minutes at<br>
room temperature in the absence of test compound as measured by liquid scintillation<br>
counting. The CPM values were corrected for the background counts produced by<br>
ATP in the absence of the enzymatic reaction. The IC50 values in TABLE 1 are<br>
averages of the individual determinations.<br><br>

Inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase<br><br>
Inhibition of Epithelial Cell Kinase (ECK)<br>
In this standard pharmacological test procedure, a biotinylated peptide<br>
substrate is first immobilized on neutravidin-coated microtiter plates. The test drug,<br>
the Epithelial Cell Kinase (ECK), Mg++, sodium vanadate (a protein tyrosine<br>
phosphatase inhibitor), and an appropriate buffer to maintain pH (7.2) are then added<br><br>
to the immobilized substrate-containing microtiter wells. ATP is then added to initiate<br>
phosphorylation. After incubation, the assay plates are washed with a suitable buffer<br>
leaving behind phosphorylated peptide which is exposed to horse radish peroxidase<br>
(HRP)-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. The antibody-treated<br>
plates are washed again and the HRP activity in individual wells is quantified as a<br>
reflection of degree of substrate phosphorylation. This nonradioactive format was<br>
used to identify inhibitors of ECK tyrosine kinase activity where the IC30 is the<br>
concentration of drug that inhibits substrate phosphorylation by 50%. The results<br>
obtained for representative compounds of this invention are listed in TABLE 2.<br>
Multiple entries for a given compound indication it was tested multiple times.<br>
Inhibition of Kinase insert Domain containing Receptor (KDR: the catalytic domain<br>
of the VEOF receptor)<br>
In this standard pharmacological test procedure, KDR protein is mixed, in the<br>
presence or absence of a inhibitor compound, with a substrate peptide to be<br>
phosphorylated (a copolymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine, E:Y :: 4:1) and other<br>
cofactors such as Mg++ and sodium vanadate (a protein tyrosine phosphatase<br>
inhibitor) in an appropriate buffer to maintain pH (7.2). ATP and a radioactive tracer<br>
(either P3:- or P33- labeled ATP) is then add to initiate phosphorylation. After<br>
incubation, the radioactive phosphate associated with the acid-insoluble fraction of<br>
the assay mixture is then quantified as reflection of substrate phosphorylation. This<br>
radioactive format was used to identify inhibitors of KDR tyrosine kinase activity<br>
where the IC30 is the concentration of drug that inhibits substrate phosphorylation by<br>
50%. The results obtained for representative compounds of this invention are listed in<br>
TABLE 2. Multiple entries for a given compound indication it was tested multiple<br>
times.<br>
Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Assay<br>
To evaluate inhibitors of the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase a two<br>
component coupled standard pharmacological test procedure, which measures<br>
phosphorylation of a serine/threonine residue in an appropriate sequence in the<br><br>
substrate in the presence and absence of a putative inhibitor, was used. Recombinant<br>
human MEK 1 (MAPKK) was first used to activate recombinant human ERK2<br>
(MAPK) and the activated MAPK (ERK) was incubated with substrate (MBP peptide<br>
or MYC peptide) in the presence of ATP, Mg*2 and radiolabeled nP ATP. The<br>
phosphorylated peptide was captured on a P 81 phosphocellulose filter (paper filter or<br>
embedded in microtiter plate) washed and counted by scintillation methods.<br>
The peptide substrates used in the assay are MBP, peptide substrate<br>
(APRTPGGRR), or synthetic Myc substrate, (KKFELLPTPPLSPSRR.5 TFA. The<br>
recombinant enzymes used were prepared as GST fusion proteins of human ERK 2<br>
and human MEK 1. Inhibitor samples were prepared as 10X stocks in 10% DMSO<br>
and an appropriate aliquot was used to deliver either 10 ug/ml for a single point<br>
screening dose or 100,10, 1, and 0.1 uM final concentration for a dose response curve.<br>
Final DMSO concentrations were less than or equal to 1%.<br>
The reaction was run as follows in 50 mM Tris kinase buffer, pH 7.4 in a<br>
reaction volume of 50 ul. The appropriate volume of kinase buffer and inhibitor<br>
sample was added to the tube. Appropriate dilution of enzyme was delivered to give 2-<br>
5 ug recombinant MAPK (Erk ) per tube. The inhibitor was incubated with MAPK<br>
(Erk) for 30 min at 0 deg. C. Recombinant Mek (MAPKK) ( 0.5-2.5 ug) or fully<br>
activated Mek (0.05-0.1 units) was added to activate the Erk and incubated for 30 min<br>
at 30° C. Then substrate and gamma 33P ATP was were added to give a final<br>
concentration of 0.5- 1 mM MBPP or 250-500 uM Myc; 0.2-0.5 uCi gamma P 33<br>
ATP/tube; 50 M ATP final concentration. Samples were incubated at 30°C for 30<br>
minutes and the reaction was stopped by adding 25 l of ice cold 10 %TCA. After<br>
samples were chilled on ice for 30 min, 20 l of sample was transferred onto P 81<br>
phosphocellulose filter paper or appropriate MTP with embedded P 81 filter. Filter<br>
papers or MTP were washed 2 times with a large volume of 1% acetic acid, then 2<br>
times with water. The filters or MTP were briefly air dried before addition of<br>
scintillant and samples were counted in the appropriate scintillation counter set up for<br>
reading 33P isotope. Samples included a positive control (activated enzyme plus<br>
substrate); a no enzyme control; a no substrate control: samples with different<br><br>
concentrations of putative inhibitor; and samples with reference inhibitors (other active<br>
compounds or non-specific inhibitors such as staurosporine or K252 B).<br>
The raw data was captured as cpm. Sample replicates were averaged and<br>
corrected for background count. Mean cpm data was tabulated by group and %<br>
inhibition by a test compound was calculated as (corrected cpm control- corrected,<br>
cpm sample/control) X 100 = % inhibition. If several concentrations of inhibitor were<br>
tested, IC30 values (the concentration which gives 50% inhibition) were determined<br>
graphically from the dose response curve for % inhibition or by an appropriate<br>
computer program. The results obtained for representative compounds of this<br>
invention are listed in TABLE 2 where there may be separate entries for the same<br>
compound; this is an indication that the compound was evaluated more than one time.<br>

Inhibition of Cancer Cell Growth as Measured by Cell Number<br>
Human tumor cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (250 l/well, 1-6 x 104<br>
cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium, containing 5% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum). Twenty<br>
four hours after plating, test compounds were added at five log concentrations (0.01-<br>
100 mg/ml) or at lower concentrations for the more potent compounds. After 48<br>
hours exposure to test compounds, cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid, and<br><br>
stained with Sulforhodamine B. After washing with trichloroacetic acid, bound dye<br>
was solubilized in 10 mM Tris base and optical density was determined using plate<br>
reader. Under conditions of the assay the optical density is proportional to the number<br>
of cells in the well. IC^s (concentrations causing 50% inhibition of cell growth) were<br>
determined from the growth inhibition plots. The test procedure is described in details<br>
by Philip Skehan et. al, J.Natl Cane. Inst., 82, 1107-1112 (1990). These data are<br>
shown below in TABLE 3 . Information about some of the cell lines used in these<br>
test procedures is available from the American Type Tissue Collection: Cell Lines<br>
and Hybridomas, 1994 Reference Guide, 8th Edition.<br>

Inhibition of Cancer Cell Growth as Measured by Cell Number (ICM ug/mL)<br><br>
BALB/c nu/nu female mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used in<br>
the in vivo standard pharmacological test procedures. Human epidermoid carcinoma<br>
cells A-431 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland # CRL-155)<br>
were grown in vitro as described above. A unit of 5 X 106 cells were injected SC<br><br>
into mice. When tumors attained a mass of between 100 and 150 mg, the mice were<br>
randomized into treatment groups (day zero). Mice were treated IP or PO once a day<br>
either on days 1, 5, and 9 or on days 1 through 10 post staging with doses of either<br>
80, 40 or 20, or 10 mg/kg/dose of the compound to be evaluated in 0.2% Klucel.<br>
Control animals received no drug. Tumor mass was determined every 7 days [(length<br>
X width2)/2] for 28 days post staging. Relative tumor growth (Mean tumor mass on<br>
day 7, 14, 21, and 28 divided by the mean tumor mass on day zero) is determined<br>
for each treatment group. The %T/C (Tumor/Control) is determined by dividing the<br>
relative tumor growth of the treated group by the relative tumor growth of the placebo<br>
group and multiplying by 100. A compound is considered to be active if the %T/C is<br>
found to be significantly less than 100%.<br>

Based on the results obtained for representative compounds of this invention,<br>
the compounds of this invention are antineoplastic agents which are useful in treating,<br>
inhibiting the growth of, or eradicating neoplasms. In particular, the compounds of<br>
this invention are useful in treating, inhibiting the growth of, or eradicating<br>
neoplasms that express EGFR such as those of the breast, kidney, bladder, mouth,<br>
larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, ovary, or lung. In addition, the compounds of this<br>
invention are useful in treating, inhibiting the growth of, or eradicating neoplasms of<br><br>
the breast that express the receptor protein produced by the erbB2 (Her2) oncogene.<br>
Based on the results obtained, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the<br>
treatment of polycystic kidney disease.<br>
The compounds of this invention may formulated near or may be combined<br>
with one or more pharraaceutically acceptable carriers for administration. For<br>
example, solvents, diluents and the like, and may be administered orally in such<br>
forms as tablets, capsules, dispersible powders, granules, or suspensions containing,<br>
for example, from about 0.05 to 5% of suspending agent, syrups containing, for<br>
example, from about 10 to 50% of sugar, and elixirs containing, for example, from<br>
about 20 to 50% ethanol, and the like, or parenterally in the form of sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension containing from about 0.05 to 5% suspending agent in an<br>
isotonic medium. Such pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from<br>
about 0.05 up to about 90% of the active ingredient in combination with the carrier,<br>
more usually between about 5% and 60% by weight.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on<br>
the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the severity of the<br>
condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when<br>
the compounds of the invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.5<br>
to about 1000 rng/kg of body weight, optionally given in divided doses two to four<br>
times a day, or in sustained release form. The total daily dosage is projected to be<br>
from about 1 to 1000 mg, preferably from about 2 to 500 mg. Dosage forms suitable<br>
for internal use comprise from about 0.5 to 1000 mg of the active compound in<br>
intimate admixture with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This<br>
dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For<br>
example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be<br>
proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered orally as well as by<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. Solid carriers include starch,<br>
lactose, dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose and kaolin, while<br>
liquid carriers include sterile water, polyethylene glycols, non-ionic surfactants and<br><br>
edible oils such as corn, peanut and sesame oils, as are appropriate to the nature of the<br>
active ingredient and the particular form of administration desired. Adjuvants<br>
customarily employed in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions may be<br>
advantageously included, such as flavoring agents, coloring agents, preserving agents,<br>
and antioxidants, for example, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, BHT and BHA.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical compositions from the standpoint of ease of<br>
preparation and administration are solid compositions, particularly tablets and hard-<br>
filled or liquid-filled capsules. Oral administration of the compounds is preferred.<br>
In some cases it may be desirable to administer the compounds directly to the<br>
airways in the form of an aerosol.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be administered parenterally or<br>
intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds as a free base<br>
or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a<br>
surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in<br>
glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparation contain a preservative to prevent the<br>
growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of<br>
sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and<br>
must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the<br>
contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can<br>
be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol<br>
(e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures<br>
thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
For the treatment of cancer, the compounds of this invention can be<br>
administered in combination with other antitumor substances or with radiation<br>
therapy. These other substances or radiation treatments can be given at the same or at<br>
different times as the compounds of this invention. These combined therapies may<br>
effect synergy and result in improved efficacy. For example, the compounds of this<br><br>
invention can be used in combination with mitotic inhibitors such as taxol or<br>
vinblastine, alkylating agents such as cisplatin or cyclophosamide, antimetabolites<br>
such as 5-fluorouracil or hydroxyurea, DNA intercalators such as adriamycin or<br>
bleomycin, topoisomerase inhibitors such as etoposide or camptothecin,<br>
antiangiogenic agents such as angiostatin, and antiestrogens such as tamoxifen.<br>
