				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates generally to apparatus for producing hydrogen. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to apparatus utilizing fossil fuels, biomass,<br>
petroleum coke, or any other carbon bearing fuel to produce hydrogen for power<br>
generation which minimizes or eliminates the release of carbon dioxide (C02).<br>
Fossil fuel power stations conventionally use steam turbines to convert heat into<br>
electricity. Conversion efficiencies of new steam power stations can exceed 40% on a<br>
lower heating value (LHV) basis. New supercritical steam boiler designs, relying on new<br>
materials, allow higher steam temperatures and pressures, providing efficiencies of close<br>
to 50% LHV and further improvements might be expected. Significant advancements<br>
have also been made in combined cycle gas turbines (CCFTs). A gas turbine can<br>
withstand much higher inlet temperatures than a steam turbine. This factor produces<br>
considerable increases in overall efficiency. The latest designs currently under<br>
construction can achieve efficiencies of over 60% LHV. All of these improvements in<br>
efficiency translate into a reduction of the specific emissions on a per megawatt basis.<br>
Although substantial reductions in emissions of C02 could be achieved by<br>
increase in efficiency of energy conversion and utilization, such reductions may not be<br>
sufficient to achieve atmospheric C02 stabilization. Therefore, efforts have also been<br>
directed towards the capture and sequestration of the C02 emitted by fossil fuel-fired<br>
power plants. Sequestration of C02 entails the storage or utilization of C02 in such a<br>
way that it is kept out of the atmosphere. Capture of the C02 may be performed prior<br>
to or after combustion of the fuel. Production of C02 may be minimized during<br>
combustion of the fuel.<br><br>
The fuel may be de-carbonized prior to combustion by extracting<br>
H2 from the hydrocarbon fuel, the C02 being captured and the H2 being<br>
subsequently combusted. Steam reforming, gasification and partial<br>
oxidation are examples of such processes. The most promising de-<br>
carbonization approach is via Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle<br>
(IGCC). With IGCC, coal is gasified to produce a synthesis gas, which is<br>
then catalytically water gas shifted in order to increase the C02<br>
concentration. This shifted synthesis gas is quenched, and C02 is<br>
removed with a solvent, such as selexoi, in a process analogous to the<br>
amine flue gas scrubbing. Separated C02, is dried and compressed to<br>
supercritical conditions for pipeline transport. The cleaned synthesis gas,<br>
now rich in H2, is fired in a combustion turbine and waste heat from the<br>
gasification quench and from the GT fuel gas is recovered to raise steam<br>
and feed a steam turbine. Because the C02 is removed from the<br>
concentrated and pressurized synthesis gas stream, the incremental<br>
capital cost and energy penalty is lower than for the capture of C02 from<br>
flue gas. A study by Parsons Energy and Chemical Group, Inc. has<br>
shown an incremental energy penalty of about 14% and the cost of C02<br>
mitigation of about $18/tonne (Owens, et al., 2000).<br>
Combustion of the fossil fuel in O2/ recycled flue gas eliminates the<br>
need for capture of C02 by using pure or enriched oxygen instead of air<br>
for combustion. A substantial energy penalty is incurred using this<br>
process due to the large power requirements of producing pure oxygen.<br>
Alternatively, separation of C02 after combustion with air can be<br>
accomplished by a variety of techniques. The most well established<br>
method today is removal from the flue gas stream by amine solvent<br>
scrubbing in an absorption-stripping process. Such processes are already<br>
applied commercially to coal-fired boilers for the purpose of producing<br>
C02 for industrial or food industry use. Unfortunately, substantial capital<br>
equipment is required. The efficiency of the power plant is significantly<br><br>
reduced by the energy required to regenerate the solvent. Studies of<br>
amine scrubbing technology applied to a U.S. utility boiler case indicate<br>
that capital investment is on the order of the original power plant and<br>
energy efficiency is reduced by 41%.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly stated, the invention in a preferred form is a gasifier for<br>
producing a gas product from a carbonaceous fuel which comprises a first<br>
chemical process loop including an exothermic oxidizer reactor and an<br>
endothermic reducer reactor. The oxidizer reactor has a CaS inlet, a hot<br>
air inlet and a CaSO4/ waste gas outlet. The reducer reactor has a CaS04<br>
inlet in fluid communication with the oxidizer reactor CaSO4/ Vwaste gas<br>
outlet, a CaS/gas product outlet in fluid communication with the oxidizer<br>
reactor CaS inlet, and a materials inlet for receiving the carbonaceous<br>
fuel. CaS is oxidized in air in the oxidizer reactor to form hot CaS04 which<br>
is discharged to the reducer reactor. Hot CaS04 and carbonaceous fuel<br>
received in the reducer reactor undergo an endothermic reaction utilizing<br>
the heat content of the CaS04, the carbonaceous fuel stripping the<br>
oxygen from the CaS04 to form CaS and the gas product. The CaS is<br>
discharged to the oxidizer reactor, and the gas product being discharged<br>
from the first chemical process foop.<br>
When the gas product is a CO rich syngas, the gasifier further<br>
comprises a second chemical process loop including a water-gas shift<br>
reactor having a syngas inlet in fluid communication with the reducer<br>
reactor CaS/gas product outlet. The shift reactor also has a CaO inlet, a<br>
steam inlet for receiving gaseous H20, and a particulate outlet. A calciner<br>
has a CaC03 inlet in fluid communication with the shift reactor particulate<br>
outlet and a CaO outlet in fluid communication with the shift reactor CaO<br>
inlet. The CO of the syngas reacts with the gaseous H20 to produce H2<br>
and C02l the C02 being captured by the CaO to form hot CaC03 in an<br><br>
exothermic reaction, the hot CaC03 being discharged to the calciner, the<br>
heat content of the CaC03 being used to strip the C02 from the CaO in an<br>
endothermic reaction in the calciner, and the CaO being discharged from<br>
the calciner to the shift reactor.<br>
The shift reactor may also have a fuel inlet for receiving the<br>
carbonaceous fuel. In this case, the CO of the syngas and the<br>
carbonaceous fuel reacts with the gaseous H20 to produce H2, CO2, and<br>
partially decarbonated, hot carbonaceous particulates, with the hot<br>
carbonaceous particulates being discharged to the reducer reactor.<br>
The oxidizer reactor may also have a particulate heat transfer<br>
material inlet and a particulate heat transfer material outlet and the<br>
calciner may also has a particulate heat transfer material inlet in fluid<br>
communication with the oxidizer reactor particulate heat transfer material<br>
outlet, and a particulate heat transfer material outlet in fluid<br>
communication with the oxidizer reactor particulate heat transfer material<br>
inlet. Hot CaS04 discharged by the oxidizer reactor is used in the<br>
endothermic reaction of the calciner and cooled CaS04 is discharged from<br>
the calciner to the oxidizer reactor.<br>
The shift reactor also includes an H2 outlet for discharging H2 from<br>
the gasifier. The shift reactor particulate outlet includes a heavies outlet<br>
discharging heavy particulates from the shift reactor and a lights outlet<br>
discharging a mixture of H2 and light particulates from the shift reactor. A<br>
separator in fluid communications with the shift reactor lights outlet<br>
separates the light particulates from the H2, discharges the H2 from the<br>
gasifier, discharges a portion of the light particulates to the reducer reactor<br>
lights inlet and another portion to the calciner CaC03 inlet.<br>
The reducer reactor may also include a char gasifier in fluid<br>
communication with the shift reactor particulate outlet, a char combustor in<br>
fluid communication with the char gasifier, and a carbon burn-out cell in<br>
fluid communication with the char combustor and the oxidizer reactor CaS<br><br>
inlet. The char gasifier includes a heavies inlet in fluid communication<br>
with the shift reactor heavies outlet, a lights inlet in fluid communication<br>
with the separator, and a hot gas outlet of the char gasifier is in fluid<br>
communication with a hot gas inlet of the shift reactor. A char outlet and a<br>
hot gas inlet of the char gasifier are in fluid communication with a char<br>
inlet and a hot gas outlet of the char combustor. A char outlet and a hot<br>
gas inlet of the char combustor are in fluid communication with a char inlet<br>
and a hot gas outlet of the carbon burm-out cell. The carbon burn-out cell<br>
includes a CaS outlet in fluid communication with the oxidizer reactor CaS<br>
inlet. Hot CaS04 from the oxidizer reactor CaSO4/ waste gas outlet is<br>
supplied to the carbon burn-out cell and the char combustor and may be<br>
supplied to the char gasifier and/or the shift reactor, <br>
The calciner may include a calciner vessel having the CaC03 inlet<br>
and CaO outlet and a combustor in fluid communication with the calciner<br>
vessel, the combustor having an air inlet and a CaS inlet. Air and CaS<br>
combusted in the combustor produces hot sorbent particles which are<br>
discharged to the calciner vessel, the heat content of the sorbent particles<br>
calcining the CaC03 to produce CaO and C02. A settling chamber is<br>
disposed intermediate the combustor and the calciner vessel such that hot<br>
sorbent particles entrained in flue gas discharged from the combustor<br>
enter the settling chamber, where hot heavy sorbent particles fall out the<br>
flue gas and enter the calciner. The flue gas and entrained light sorbent<br>
particles are discharged to a first separator, where the fine sorbent<br>
particles are separated from the flue gas. The CaO and the CO2<br>
produced by calcining the CaC03 are discharged from the calciner vessel<br>
to a second separator. C02 produced by calcining the CaC03 is also<br>
discharged through a bypass line. A bypass valve controls the C02 flow<br>
distribution between the separator and the bypass line, thereby limiting the<br>
exit velocity of the C02 to the separator to prevent entrainment of heavy<br><br>
sorbent particles in the exiting C02. The second separator discharges the<br>
CaO to the shift reactor.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a gasifier which produces<br>
a medium Btu syngas without requiring and oxygen plant.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a gasifier which<br>
captures carbon dioxide, generated during production a medium Btu<br>
syngas, more efficiently than conventional methods.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the drawings and specification.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference to the drawings wherein like numerals represent<br>
like parts throughout the several figures, a gasifier in accordance with the<br>
present invention is generally designated by the numeral 10. The gasifier<br>
10 includes chemical process loops, where calcium based compounds are<br>
"looped" to extract oxygen from air and where COz is extracted from<br><br>
reformed synthetic gas ("syngas") to produce hydrogen (H2), and thermal<br>
process loops, where solid particulates transfer heat from exothermic<br>
oxidation reactions to endothermic reduction reactions.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the first chemical process loop is a calcium<br>
sulfide/calcium sulfate (CaS/CaS04) loop 12. The process equipment in<br>
the CaS/CaS04 loop 12 includes an exothermic oxidizer reactor 14, an<br>
endothermic reducer reactor 16, and a heat exchanger 18. Conventional<br>
piping, ductwork, and material transport apparatus interconnect these<br>
major components 14,16,18 of the CaS/CaS04 loop 12 as described in<br>
greater detail below. Calcium sulfide and hot air are fed along paths 20,<br>
22 through inlets 24, 26 into the oxidizer reactor 14 where the CaS is<br>
oxidized at a temperature of 1600 to 2300°F to form CaS04 which is<br>
discharged at a location 28 from the oxidizer reactor through an outlet 30.<br>
The CaS04 is separated from the waste gas components (principally N2)<br>
of the air fed along the path 22 into the loop 12 in a separator 31. The<br>
CaS04l heated by the exothermic reaction in the oxidizer reactor 14, and<br>
carbon bearing fuel, preferably in the form of coal, are fed along paths 28,<br>
90 into the reducer reactor through inlets 32, 34. In an endothermic<br>
reaction occurring at a temperature of 1200 to 2000°F, the coal strips the<br>
oxygen from the calcium sulfate to form calcium sulfide, a syngas rich in<br>
carbon monoxide (CO) and H2. The CaS is discharged along a path 36<br>
from the reducer reactor 16 through an outlet 38 which is connected to a<br>
separator 37, where the CaS is separated from the syngas, the CaS being<br>
discharged to the inlet 24 of the oxidizer reactor 14, to complete the loop<br>
12. A heat exchange unit 39 may be disposed within the reducer reactor<br>
16 to produce steam.<br>
A portion of the calcium carbonate (CaC03) added along a path<br>
40 to the calciner 42 (described in greater detail below) is carried over<br>
along a path 44 (as CaO) to the first chemical process loop 12 to capture<br>
fuel bound sulfur, forming CaSC4. CaSQ4 which is excess to the loop<br><br>
requirements is discharged along the path 46 from either the oxidizer<br>
reactor 14 or the reducer reactor 16 to maintain the mass balance of the<br>
chemical reactions. The continuous requirement to capture fuel-bound<br>
sulfur to form CaSO4 regenerates the calcium compounds used in the first<br>
chemical process loop 12, keeping the chemical reactivity high.<br>
Depending on the mass flow rate, the heat content of the CaS04 may be<br>
sufficient to maintain the heat balance between the exothermic oxidizer<br>
reactor 14 and the endothermic reducer reactor 16. If the mass flow rate<br>
of the CaS04 is insufficient to maintain the heat balance, inert bauxite<br>
(AI2O3) particles may be circulated along paths 28, 36, 20 between the<br>
oxidizer reactor 14 and the reducer reactor 16 to increase the total mass<br>
of the heat transfer medium.<br>
The heat exchanger 18 includes a hot end 48 having syngas and<br>
waste gas inlets and an air outlet, a cold end 50 having syngas and waste<br>
gas outlets and an air inlet, and heat transfer material disposed between<br>
the hot and cold ends defining flow passages between the syngas inlet<br>
and outlet, the waste gas inlet and outlet, and the air outlet and inlet. The<br>
syngas (CO) inlet is connected to the syngas outlet of the reducer reactor<br>
16, the waste gas inlet is connected to the waste gas outlet of the oxidizer<br>
reactor 14, and the air outlet is connected to the air inlet of the oxidizer<br>
reactor 14. The heat content of the syngas and waste gas is transferred to<br>
the air delivered to the oxidizer reactor by the heat transfer material of the<br>
heat exchanger 18, improving the efficiency of the exothermic reaction in<br>
the oxidizer reactor 14.<br>
In the first chemical process loop 12, the amount of oxygen in the<br>
air delivered to the coal is only sufficient for partial oxidation.In this case,<br>
the end product is a sulfur free syngas rich in carbon monoxide (&gt;300<br>
Btu/ft3) suitable for a gas turbine combined cycle. Alternatively, when the<br>
amount of oxygen supplied is sufficient to burn all of the coal, the loop<br>
acts as a combustion system having end products of pure C02 and steam.<br><br>
The second chemical process loop is a lime/calcium carbonate<br>
(CaO/CaC03) loop 52. The process equipment in the CaO/CaC03 loop<br>
includes a calciner 42 and a water-gas shift reactor 54. Conventional<br>
piping, ductwork, and material transport apparatus interconnect these<br>
components as described in greater detail below. Steam, lime (CaO), and<br>
the CO rich syngas produced in the CaS/CaS04 loop 12 are fed along<br>
paths 56,58, 60 through inlets 62, 64, 66 into the shift reactor 54 where,<br>
the CO of the syngas reacts with the gaseous H20 to produce H2 and<br>
CO2. The lime captures the C02, forming CaC03 in an exothermic<br>
reaction, producing a temperature level of 1200-1700°F. This heat can<br>
drive a gasification reaction of the entering fuel and gas and may<br>
generate, as schematically shown at location 68, high temperature steam<br>
for a steam turbine.<br>
The CaC03 and H2 are each discharged along paths 70, 72 from<br>
the shift reactor 54 through an outlet 74, 76. The H2 is received in a<br>
separator 77, where any fines entrained in the flow of H2 are removed and<br>
discharged along a path 79 to the shift reactor 54. A compressor 78 in the<br>
syngas discharge line 80 pressurizes the H2 to a sufficient level to inject<br>
the H2 into a gas turbine, fuel cell or other hydrogen using process. The<br>
CaC03 is transported to the calciner 42 to drive off C02 gas and to<br>
regenerate CaO which is then returned along a path 58 to the shift reactor<br>
54 to capture more C02, completing the loop 52. Capture of the C02 by<br>
the production of CaC03 drives the endothermic gasification reaction<br>
between the carbon dioxide, water and fuel to produce a greater quantity<br>
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and to limit the amount of heat which<br>
must be removed (by producing steam 68). The hydrogen is produced by<br>
the water gas shift reaction<br>
CO + H20 5↔ C02 + H2<br>
and the carbon dioxide is captured by the reaction<br>
CaO + Co2→Ca C03<br><br>
When the two chemical process loops 12, 52 and thermal process<br>
loops 82, 83; 84, 85 are combined, a coal to hydrogen chemical process<br>
88 is formed where the CaO required by the reducer reactor 16 is<br>
produced by the calciner 42, the CO rich syngas required by the shift<br>
reactor 54 is produced by the reducer reactor 16, and the heat required by<br>
the calciner 42 is produced by the oxidizer reactor 14 (described in greater<br>
detail below). The gasifier 10 and process for producing hydrogen 88<br>
disclosed herein is more efficient than the oxygen blown IGCC process,<br>
the parasitic power loss of the oxygen plant, the heat losses associated<br>
with water-gas shift cooling, and the low temperature sulfur recovery<br>
associated with the IGCC process outweighing the need for a syngas<br>
compressor 78 in the subject gasifier 10.<br>
The calciner 42 in the CaO/CaC03 loop 52 is a high temperature<br>
endothermic reactor that receives its heat from the oxidizer reactor 14 in<br>
the CaS/CaSC-4 loop 12. In a first embodiment of a thermal process loop<br>
82, 83 transferring heat from the oxidizer reactor 14 to the calciner 42<br>
(Figure 1), a heat exchange mass in the form of inert particles, such as<br>
bauxite (Al203) particles or sorbent (CaO, CaC03, CaS, CaS04) particles<br>
is circulated 82, 83 between the oxidizer reactor 14 and the calciner 42 via<br>
interconnecting piping. The bauxite, CaO, CaS, and CaS04 is chemically<br>
inert in the calciner and can be separated from the reactants of either<br>
chemical process loop 12, 52 allowing the heat to be balanced<br>
independent of the mass balance of the chemically active material. Any<br>
bauxite which is lost during the operating cycle of the gasifier 10 may be<br>
made-up by adding, along the path 90, new bauxite particles through an<br>
inlet 34 to the reducer reactor 16.<br>
With reference to Figures 3 and 4, sorbent (CaO, CaC03, CaS,<br>
CaS04) particles and coal (carbon) particles are the primary heat transfer<br>
mass in a second embodiment of the gasifier 10'. Bauxite particles may<br>
be utilized to provide for any heat transfer mass that is required for<br><br>
operation but which is not provided by the sorbent and coal particles. The<br>
raw coal utilized by the gasifier 10' is fed along a path 92 into the shift<br>
reactor 54 through an inlet (along with the lime and steam 94, 96). The<br>
high temperature generated by the exothermic reaction producing the<br>
CaC03 devolatize and partially decarbonate the coal, with the resulting<br>
char, in the form of "heavies" and "lights", being discharged along paths<br>
98,100 from the shift reactor 54 through a pair of outlets 102, 104 which<br>
are connected to a pair of inlets 106,108 on the reducer reactor 16.<br>
CaC03 particles, in the form of lights, are also discharged 100 from the<br>
shift reactor 54. The flow of lights is received in a separator 110, where<br>
the small particles of char and calcium carbonate are separated from the<br>
hydrogen in which they are entrained. The lights and the hydrogen are<br>
discharged along paths 112,114 from the separator 110, with the<br>
hydrogen being piped to the hydrogen discharge 72 of the shift reactor 54<br>
and the lights joining the large char particles (the heavies) in the reducer<br>
. reactor 16. A portion of the small char particles and CaC03 may be fed<br>
along a path 113 to the calciner 42 to regenerate CaO and separate C02.<br>
A heat exchange unit 115 may be disposed between the shift reactor 54<br>
and the compressor 78 to produce steam.<br>
\n the thermal process loop 84, 85 of this embodiment 10', the<br>
reducer reactor 16 comprises three sections, a char gasifier 116, a char<br>
combustor 118 and a carbon burn-out cell 120. As shown in Figure 3, the<br>
char gasifier heavies and lights inlets 106,108 are connected to the shift<br>
reactor heavies outlet 102 and the separator lights outlet 122 as described<br>
above. In addition, a gas outlet 124 of the char gasifier 116 is connected<br>
to a gas inlet 126 of the shift reactor 54 and a gas inlet 128 and a char<br>
outlet 130 of the char gasifier 116 are connected to a gas outlet 132 and a<br>
char inlet 134 of the char combustor 118. The char combustor 118 also<br>
has a char outlet 136 connected to a char inlet 138 of the carbon burn-out<br>
cell 120, a gas inlet 139 connected to a gas outlet 141 of the carbon burn-<br><br>
out cell 120, and a CaS04 inlet 140 connected to an outlet of the oxidizer<br>
reactor 14. The carbon burn-out cell 120 also has a CaS/fuel outlet 142<br>
connected to an inlet of the oxidizer reactor 14, preferably has a CaS04<br>
inlet 144 connected to an outlet of the oxidizer reactor 14, and may have<br>
an air inlet 146.<br>
As described above, the oxidizer reactor 14 produces CaS04 in<br>
an exothermic reaction. The heat produced in this reaction is absorbed by<br>
the CaS04 and is transported 28 with the CaS04 to the reducer reactor<br>
16. A portion of the flow of hot CaS04 is preferably split into three<br>
streams, with a small portion of the hot CaS04 being fed along a path 148<br>
to the carbon burn-out cell 120 and larger portions of the hot CaS04 being<br>
fed along paths 150,153 to the char cfmbustor 118 and, when necessary,<br>
to the char gasifier 116. The heat and ioxygen content of the hot CaS04<br>
decarbonizes the char received in the carbon burn-out cell 120,<br>
completing the decarbonization of the coal and producing a C02 rich gas<br>
which is discharged along a path 151 to the char combustor and cool CaS<br>
which is discharged along a path 152 to the oxidizer reactor 14. The heat<br>
and oxygen content of the hot CaS04 partially decarbonizes the char<br>
received in the char combustor 118, producing hot C02, CO and H2O.<br>
The remaining char is discharged along a path 154 to the carbon burn-out<br>
cell 120 and the hot gases are discharged along a path 156 to the char<br>
gasifier 116. The heat and oxygen content of the hot gases (and CaS04<br>
when fed along a path 153 to the char gasifier 116) partially decarbonizes<br>
the char received in the char gasifier 116, producing hot H2 and hot CO<br>
rich syngas. The remaining char is discharged along a path 158 to the<br>
char combustor 118 and the hot gases (including any remaining hot C02<br>
and hot H20) are discharged along a path 160 to the shift reactor 54.<br>
It should be appreciated that staged gasification of the coal with<br>
the coal solids and coal gases moving in counterflow provides an efficient<br>
means to maximize carbon conversion/minimize unbumed carbon and<br><br>
maximize the production of H2 and CO gas while also providing an<br>
efficient means for transferring the heat energy produced by the oxidizer<br>
reactor to both the reducer reactor 16 and the shift reactor 54. It should<br>
be further appreciated that the hot gases fed along a path 160 from the<br>
char gasifier 116 to the shift reactor 54 will further heat the CaC03 which<br>
is fed along a path 70 from the shift reactor 54 to the calciner 42, thereby<br>
reducing the heat energy required to perform the calcination process. If<br>
additional heat input is required for the calciner 42, hot CaS04 may be fed<br>
along a path 162 from the oxidizer reactor 14 to the shift reactor 54.<br>
Alternatively, bauxite or other inert particles may be circulated between<br>
the oxidizer reactor 14 and the calciner 42 via the shift reactor 54.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the calciner 42' may include a<br>
combustor 166 in which air and CaS are combusted to produce additional<br>
heat for the calciner 42' (Figure 2). Particles of hot sorbent entrained in<br>
the flue gas are discharged along a path 168 from the combustor 166 and<br>
enter a settling chamber 170, where the heavy hot solids fall out along a<br>
path 172 of the flue gas and exit the settling chamber via a sloped duct<br>
174. The flue gas and entrained lights are discharged along a path 176 to<br>
a separator 178, where the fines are separated from the flue gas. The hot<br>
heavy solids are fed by the duct 174 into the calciner vessel 180, along<br>
with the cool CaC03 and hot bauxite particles (if being used). The heat<br>
from the heavy solids and bauxite particles calcines the CaC03, producing<br>
CaO and C02 (for subsequent use or sequestration).<br>
The hot heavy solids, CaC03 and hot bauxite particles are<br>
introduced near the bottom of the calciner vessel 180, CO2 is released<br>
thereby forcing the cooling heavy solids, cooling bauxite and the<br>
CaCO3/CaO upwards along a path 182. The cold heavy solids and cold<br>
bauxite spill over a location 184 the side of the calciner vessel 180 and<br>
are fed along a path 186 to the combustor 166 by a spillway 188. The<br>
cold bauxite is returned along a path 190 to the oxidizer reactor 14 for<br><br>
heating and the heavy solids are further combusted in the combustor 166.<br>
The relatively light CaO is entrained in the C02, the combined CaO and<br>
C02 being discharged along a path 192 from the calciner vessel 180 to a<br>
separator 194 which removes the CaO from the CO2. A portion of the<br>
CO2 is removed along a path 196 from the calciner vessel 180 by a filter<br>
198 which prevents the CaO entrained therein from also being removed.<br>
A valve 200 in the bypass line 202 controls the volumetric flow of C02<br>
through the bypass line 202, thereby controlling the C02 flow distribution<br>
between the separator 194 and the bypass line 202 and controlling the<br>
exit velocity of the CO2 to the separator 194 to prevent entrainment of<br>
heavy solids in the exiting C02.<br>
To maintain the efficiency of the chemical process loops<br>
described above, it is important to maintain the sorbent activity of the<br>
chemicals utilized in the chemical process loops 12, 52. As discussed<br>
above, fuel bound sulfur is continuously captured in the CaS/CaS04 loop<br>
12, requiring continuous removal at a location 46 of CaS04 and<br>
continuous addition at a location 40 of CaCOz. The CaCO3 is removed<br>
from the CaO/CaC03 loop 52, requiring the continuous addition at a<br>
location 94 of CaO. The continuous replenishment at the location 94 of<br>
CaO substantially regenerates the calcium compounds used in the gasifier<br>
10, keeping the chemical reactivity high. In addition, the sorbent activity of<br>
the chemicals is enhanced by the reduction reactions and hydration<br>
reactions employed in the chemical process loops 12, 52, which weaken<br>
the CaS04 and CaC03 shells. The CaO produced by the calciner 42<br>
passes through an activator 204 which mechanically breaks the particle,<br>
exposing additional surface. The activator 204 includes an eductor where<br>
a portion of the flow of CaO is entrained in a flow of gas and accelerated<br>
thereby. The entrained CaO is impacted against a surface of the activator<br>
204, the impact mechanically fracturing the particles, assisted as<br>
necessary by steam or water hydration 206.<br><br>
