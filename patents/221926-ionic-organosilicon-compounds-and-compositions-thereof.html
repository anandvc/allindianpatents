BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to ionic organosilicon compounds comprising aqueous compositions comprising such ionic organosilicon compounds; wherein the compositions are suitable for applying to inorganic surfaces to impart water repellency.<br>
Water resistance is an important issue in many types of construction including masonry and concrete. Resistance to water is of great importance since moisture absorption and its movement in these types of materials cause or contributes to problems such as expansion, shrinkage, cracking, staining, mildew, lowered resistance to freezing and thawing, chemical attack, corrosion of reinforcing steel, and damage to structures from settling. Due to these problems, various techniques have been used to render these types of surfaces water resistant including surface treatment of structures with water repellents. Water repellents that have been used in the past include oils, waxes, soaps, and resins. These repellants have been applied to surfaces by brush, roller, air spray, or airless spray techniques. One type of water repellent that has been used is organosilicon compounds. These compounds in organic solvents have been found to be useful for providing water resistance to brick, concrete, stucco, or terrazo surfaces.<br>
As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,195, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, application of organosilicon compounds to surfaces for water proofing is well known in the art. The use of organosilicon compounds such as alkyltrialkoxy compounds for imparting water resistance has been known for at least 30 years. Traditionally, application of these compounds was carried out in flammable solvents such as ethanol, methanol and various liquid hydrocarbons. During application, volatile organic compounds (VOC) were heavily emitted. Due to these problems, significant efforts were employed to formulate a nonflammable composition for imparting water resistance to masonry and concrete surfaces. The first approach attempted included various water emulsions containing organosilicon compounds. However, these formulations failed to provide water resistance comparable to the solvent based compositions. In recognition of the shortcomings associated with the water emulsion formulation, formulations were developed to make alkyltrialkoxy silanes water soluble. Formulations of this type utilize water soluble amino and quaternary ammonium organosilanes along with alkyltrialkoxysilanes of the traditional formulations. The intent of these formulations<br><br>
was to exploit the soluble organosilanes to solubilize the alkyltrialkoxysilanes, which provided the water repellant characteristic.<br>
In addition to water resistance, numerous types of construction materials benefit from treatment with an antimicrobial agent. Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that prevent microbial contamination and deterioration of materials. Possibly the most prevalent group of antimicrobials is quaternary ammonium compounds. The use of low level (1% or lower) quaternary ammonium silanes as antimicrobial agents is well known and taught in a wide variety of United States patents including U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,560,385; 3,794,736; and 3,814,739. Due to their antimicrobial qualities, their application is beneficial for a variety of surfaces, substrates, instruments and applications. Examples of such uses are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,730,701; 3,794,736; 3,860,709; 4,282,366; 4,504,541; 4,615,937; 4,692,374; 4,408,996; and 4,414,268; the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Application of an aqueous solution containing a quaternary ammonium silane is discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,921,701 and 5,169,625.<br>
Relevant to the present invention are U.S. Pat. 5,209,775, 5,421,866, 5,695,551, CA 2,115,622 and JP 3,159,975. These patents are directed to water dispersible or water emulsion water repellent compositions of silicon compounds. The compositions disclosed in these patents contain (1) alkylalkoxy silane or siloxanes; (2) a water soluble silane; and (3) either aminosilane or quaternary ammonium silane. The role of soluble silane, aminosilane or ionic quaternary ammonium silane, in these compositions is to stabilize the alkylalkoxysilane, siloxane, or other water insoluble polymers in water.<br>
The use of hydrophobic water insoluble silane based water repellents in various organic solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons has been traditionally preferred due to their superior performance. However, the principal limitations of these solvent type compositions include their inherent toxicity and flammability. While providing an ecological improvement over solvent based treatments, the existing organosiloxane emulsions and water dispersible silanes or siloxanes do not compare well with existing solvent-base silanes, silane/siloxanes combinations or siloxanes in terms of stability, penetration depth, and the beading effect of the treated substrate. Additionally, the use of surfactants may cause rewetting of the surface.<br>
Therefore, there remains a need for a nonflammable aqueous composition useful for waterproofing inorganic substrates capable of providing at least equally efficient water resistance<br>
-3-<br><br>
as solvent based compositions while also complying with VOC emission regulations. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a nonflammable aqueous composition effectively suitable for imparting hydrophobicity to inorganic surfaces. More specifically, it is an object of this invention to provide the following three highly sought after characteristics for water repellants used on inorganic substrates: (1) a safer and environmentally acceptable aqueous solution, (2) imparting molecular level hydrophobicity and (3) reactivity with a substrate to provide long term performance.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to ionic organosilicon compounds comprising aqueous compositions comprising such ionic organosilicon compounds; wherein the compositions are suitable for applying to inorganic surfaces to impart water repellency to a wide variety of surfaces. The compositions of the present invention are prepared by dissolving ionic organosilicon compounds in water. Surprisingly, it has been found that the water soluble ionic organosilicon compounds, which have an ionic group, a hydrophobic group and at least one alkoxy group on silicon, of the present invention provide treated surfaces with excellent hydrophobicity. Until the present invention, these compounds have only been used in small quantities to solubilize silanes. The present invention satisfies the aforementioned needs by providing aqueous solutions comprising ionic organosilicon compounds dissolved in water.<br>
Despite the water soluble nature of the ionic organosilicon compounds of the present invention, aqueous compositions of such compounds provide exceptional water resistance when applied to inorganic surfaces. All aqueous compostitions of the present invention consist essentially of at least one ionic organosilicon compound. Although desiring not to be held to the following explanation, it is believed that upon drying of the aqueous ionic organosilicon solution the molecular packing on the surface is such that the ionic group which enables solubility in water is buried deep within the structure after the silane forms chemical bonds with the inorganic surface. Accordingly, after application a treated surface may be characterized as having a long term water repellant layer. Thus, there are differences between what is taught in accordance with the concept of the present invention and what is disclosed in the prior art as evidenced by the several patents noted and discussed above.<br>

The compositions in accordance with the present invention are made by dissolving an ionic organosilicon in water. Additionally, more than one ionic organosilicon compound can be<br>

dissolved in water to formulate an aqueous solution comprising more than one ionic organosilicon compound. Furthermore, some compositions in accordance with the present invention may also include known excipients such as for example wetting agents, surfactants, and antimicrobial agents. These solutions comply with the local state and federal regulations regarding volatile organic content (VOC) with desired application dosage and can be applied to a wide variety of surfaces by any known means including for example by brush, roller, air spray, and airless spray techniques. After an aqueous solution comprising an ionic organosilicon is applied and allowed to dry, a treated surface is obtained comprising a protective water resistant layer bonded to the substrate. Although wishing not to be held to the following explanation, it is believed that upon drying the molecular packing on the surface is such that the ionic group which enables solubility in water is buried deep within the structure after the silane forms chemical bonds with the surface. Furthermore, it is believed that the long chain on the central ionic group prohibits water from reaching the soluble ionic part of the molecule. Accordingly, the present invention also provides treated surfaces comprising a unique layer in which the soluble components are shielded from water by long chains attached to the soluble component.<br>
Any surface with functional groups that will bond with the silanols created by hydrolysis of the silane alkoxy groups may be rendered water repel lant upon treatment with aqueous solutions of the present invention. Some suitable surfaces for example include heavy and light weight concrete, masonry products, gypsum, concrete blocks, cinder blocks, soft mud bricks, sand lime bricks, drain tiles, ceramic tiles, sandstone, plaster, clay bricks, natural stones and rocks, roofing tiles, calcium silicate bricks, cement articles, slag stones and bricks, stucco, limestone, macadam, marble, grouts, mortar, terrazzo, clinker, pumice, terra, cotta, porcelain, adobe, coral, dolomite and asphalt. Non-cement surfaces may be treated with compositions of the present invention including but not limited to perlite, cellular glass, vermiculite, mica, silica and diatomaceous earth.<br>
In one embodiment, the ionic organosilicon composition may include at least about 0.1 weight percent of an ionic organosilicon compound. Additionally, some embodiments may include between about 0.1 and about 10 weight percent of an ionic orgaosilicaon compound while others may comprise between about 10 and 99 weight percent or preferably about 20 and 60 weight percent of an organosilicon compound.<br>

Example 10 Capillary Absorption Test<br>
After conditioning, samples of treated and untreated concrete cubes were taken for further experimentation. Initial weights of all the cubes were recorded. The weighed samples were placed in a container on a porous support made from a pack of filter papers. The thickness of the pack was approximately 1cm. The pack of filter papers ensures immediate and continuous contact between water and only the surface on which the samples were resting. Tap water was slowly poured into the container until the paper was completely saturated. The water level was not allowed to rise beyond the top border of the pack. For reducing evaporation of water, the container was covered with a glass sheet.<br>
For assessing the capillary water absorption, the samples were removed from the container after one hour. After wiping the surface in contact with water with a damp cloth, each sample was weighed. The results obtained are provided in Table-V.<br>
