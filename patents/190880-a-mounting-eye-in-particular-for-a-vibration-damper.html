in particular for a vibration damper<br>
The invention relates to a mounting eye/according to the introductory part<br>
of claim 1.<br>
Such an eye is known from US- 3, 343, 833. Unfortunately a plastics mounting eye such as disclosed in the state of the art cannot be used. The necessary force transfer is not achieved. In this there is also to be seen the reason why, in particular in the field of use on a vibration damper, plastics mounting eyes do not find any increasing use.<br>
It is the aim of the present invention to achieve a plastics mounting eye in which the necessary minimum retaining forces are achieved.<br>
The problem is solved according to the invention by claim 1.<br>
By the introduction of the reinforcing sleeve the necessary forces can be handled with certainty. Only minimal additional costs arise, bearing no relation to the result achieved.<br>
To avoid relative movements between the reinforcing sleeve and the mounting eye the reinforcing sleeve forms a mechanical inter-engagement with the plastics body at least over a portion of its external peripheral surface which departs from a uniform round shape. Thus it is provided that the departing region is in the form of a polygon.<br>
For locating the mounting eye axially, the departing region is formed by at least one circumferentially extending collar. It has been found particularly   advantageous   if   the   circumferentially   extending   collar   is<br><br><br>
mounted respectively at each end of the reinforcing sleeve. The guiding quality of the reinforcing sleeve is particularly good in this embodiment.<br>
Moreover in an advantageous manner the reinforcing sleeve has a base or floor at that end which faces towards the transverse opening. The base simplifies the outlay on sealing within the injection mould so that no material can penetrate into the connecting opening.<br>
By arranging that the plastics body has a cover surface with an annular wall for attachment of a shielding tube, the mounting eye is particularly suitable for vibration dampers and gas springs, of which the piston rods have to be protected from contamination and dust. It offers the possibility that the cover surface is additionally connected to the remainder of the plastics body through stiffening ribs.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a mounting eye, in particular for a vibration damper, comprising a plastics body with a transverse opening for an attachment device, a connecting opening for joining it on to the body which is to be mounted, characterised in that the connecting opening has a metallic reinforcing sleeve for strengthening the connection.<br>
The invention is further explained in conjunction with the following description of the drawings.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1	shows the mounting eye on a vibration damper<br>
Figs. 2 and 3	show embodiments of the mounting eye.<br>
Figure 1 shows a vibration damper 1, the internal components of it not being illustrated. It will be understood that the invention is not limited exclusively to vibration dampers. Arranged within the damper is a piston rod 3, of which the end lies outside a cylinder 5 and has a mounting eye 7. The piston rod 3 has a screw thread for attachment of the mounting  eye.     A   tiltably  deformable  rubber  ring 11   is   inserted   in  a<br><br>
transverse opening 9 in the mounting eye and a bush 13 is pressed into / this ring.    A shielding tube 15 encloses the piston rod and prevents the access of dirt.<br>
Figure 2 shows the mounting eye 7 as an individual component. The mounting eye comprises substantially a plastic body 17 with a transverse opening 9 for attachment means. In the axial direction there is formed a connecting opening 19 in which there is arranged a reinforcing sleeve 21. In this connection the reinforcing sleeve has a mechanical inter-engagement with the plastics body over a region of its outer peripheral surface 23 which departs from a uniform round shape. For example there is offered the possibility that the reinforcing sleeve is made from a polygonal section which is commercially available. Relative rotational movement between the plastics body and the reinforcing sleeve is prevented. A circumferentially extending collar 25 opposes any translatory relative movement. A screw thread 27 matching the thread on the piston rod is machined within the reinforcing sleeve. In the assembled condition the reinforcing sleeve bears against a shoulder 29 (Fig. 1) on the piston rod.<br>
The plastics body has a cover portion 31 with an annular wall 33 for the shielding tube. The shielding tube engages the cover portion and an end face 35 of the annular wall.<br>
In the manufacture of the mounting eye the reinforcing sleeve is inserted in an injection mould with the screw thread sealed off. The plastics which is injected flows around the circumferential collar and the external peripheral surface of the sleeve, resulting in a firm non-rotatable relative connection which can handle with certainty the retaining forces which are required.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a modification of Fig. 2 and so only the differences are discussed. A significant departure lies in the fact that the reinforcing sleeve 21 has the circumferentially extending collar 25 at each of its ends, the collar which is nearest to the transverse opening 9 being formed by a base or floor 37 of the sleeve. The sleeve has an undercut 39 for the thread 27 to simplify the machining of the thread.<br>
Furthermore stiffening ribs 41 are provided between the cover portion 31 and the remainder of the plastics body 7. Also in the plan view can be seen the polygonal profile of the external surface 23 of the reinforcing sleeve 21 as already described with reference to Fig. 2.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A mounting eye, in particular for a vibration damper, comprising a plastics body (17) with a transverse opening for an attachment device, a connecting opening for joining it on to the body which is to be mounted, characterised in that the connecting opening (19) has a metallic reinforcing sleeve (21) for strengthening the connection.<br>
2.	The mounting eye according to claim 1, wherein the reinforcing sleeve forms, at least over a region of its outer peripheral surface (23) that departs from the uniform round shape, a mechanical inter-engagement with the plastics body (17).<br>
3.	The mounting eye according to claim 2, wherein the departing region is in the form of a polygon.<br>
4.	The mounting eye according to claim 2, wherein the departing-region is formed by at least one circumferential collar (25).<br>
5.	The mounting eye according to claim 4, wherein a circumferential collar is mounted on each end respectively of the reinforcing sleeve.<br>
6.	The mounting eye according to claim 1, wherein the reinforcing sleeve has a base (37) at that end which faces towards the transverse opening (9).<br>
7.	The mounting eye according to claim 1, wherein the plastics body has a cover surface (31) with an annular wall (33) for attaching a shielding tube (15).<br><br>
8.	The mounting eye according to claim 7, wherein the cover surface is connected<br>
to the remainder of the plastics body additionally through stiffening ribs (41).<br>
9.	A mounting eye. in particular for a vibration damper substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
