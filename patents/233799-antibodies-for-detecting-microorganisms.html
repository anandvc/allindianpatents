DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND ART<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention pertains to antibodies<br>
useful in the detection of various microorganisms,<br>
particularly bacteria, and a method of detecting<br>
microorganisms, reagent kits for detection of<br>
microorganisms that use said antibodies, and a method<br>
for preparing specific antibodies for detecting<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Moreover, the present invention is valuable to<br>
the drug industry, particularly for diagnostic<br>
medicine of microbial infections with an emphasis on<br>
bacteria.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Diagnosis of microbial infection is confirmed by<br>
detection of the causative pathogen form the infected<br>
area or by detection of antibodies to the causative<br>
pathogen in serum and body fluids. Detection of the<br>
causative pathogen is particularly important in the<br>
sense that it makes quick treatment to the patient<br>
possible.<br>
Detection of the causative pathogen of infections<br>
can be generally classified as cultivation and<br>
identification methods, whereby the causative<br>
pathogen is separated and cultivated and then<br>
identified based on its biochemical properties;<br>
genetic diagnosis, whereby amplification by PCR,<br>
etc., is performed based on specific genes of the<br>
causative pathogen and thus the causative pathogen is<br>
detected; or immunological methods, whereby the<br>
causative pathogen is detected using a specific<br>
reaction of antibody with surface antigen marker of<br>
the causative pathogen. However, it takes time to<br>
obtain results by cultivation and identification<br>
methods or genetic diagnosis methods. Therefore,<br>
diagnosis by immunological methods is commonly used<br>
because the causative pathogen can be detected within<br>
a short time with high sensitivity and the patient<br>
can be quickly and appropriately treated.<br>
Depending on the bacterial species, a variety of<br>
marker antigens and antibodies can be used alone or,<br>
in combination to detect the causative patho-gen of<br>
infections by conventional immunological methods.<br>
For instance, it is known that lipopolysaccharide<br>
(LPS), which is a genus-specific antigen of<br>
Chlamydia,  is present as an antigen determinant<br>
(Stephens, R., et al.: J. Immunol., 128:1033-89,<br>
1982, Caldwell, M.D.: Inf. Immun. , 44:306-14, 1984),<br>
and antibodies to LPS are used as the reagent<br>
antibody in a variety of diagnostic kits,<br>
particularly for the detection of Chlamydia<br>
trachomatis.<br>
Moreover, Ellena M. Peterson et al., (Infection<br>
and Immunity, 59(11), 4147-4153, 1991) and Byron E.<br>
Batteiger et al. , (Infection and Immunity, 53(3) ,<br>
530-533, 1986) have reported monoclonal antibodies to<br>
major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of the genus<br>
Chlamydia  respectively.<br>
Publication of unexamined Japanese patent<br>
application No. 298/1988 discusses an immunodetection<br>
method based on the western blot method that uses a<br>
monoclonal antibody to an approximately 43 kilo<br>
Dalton membrane protein antigen of Mycoplasma<br>
pneumoniae.<br>
Moreover, a method of preparing monoclonal<br>
antibody to Haemophilus  influenzae  and a diagnostic<br>
method that uses said antibody are presented in<br>
Publication of unexamined Japanese patent application<br>
No. 148859/1987 (Japanese Patent No. 64065/1994) .<br>
Proteins of approximately 20 kilo Dalton isolated<br>
from the sodium cholate extract of the outer membrane<br>
vesicle of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  strain BS4 (NCTC<br>
11922)are documented and preparation of hybridomas<br>
using said substance is disclosed in British Patent<br>
Application No. 2,172,704. Moreover, European Patent<br>
Document no., EP 419238 Al describes preparation of a<br>
monoclonal antibody, which can bind to a protein of<br>
approximately 14 kilo Dalton prepared by using<br>
Neisseria gonorrhoeae  as an immunogen and a method<br>
for the preparation of such a monoclonal antibody.<br>
Additionally, a method of detecting the same<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  using monoclonal antibody to<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mentioned in Canadian<br>
Patent Application No. 1,220,147.<br>
However, there are problems with said antibodies<br>
and detection methods based on those antibodies in<br>
that species specificity to microorganisms is<br>
insufficient for proper diagnosis. The antibodies do<br>
not d-etect all serum types as plural surface antigens<br>
present within one species.<br>
Marker antigens used in these prior arts are not<br>
standardized so that microorganisms can be detected<br>
using a same functional molecule (for instance,<br>
protein, LPS or surface polysaccharide component with<br>
the same function) which is generally present in<br>
cells of various microorganisms and which changes<br>
during the course of evolution of the microorganisms<br>
as a marker, and an immunodiagnostic method based on<br>
the concept of detecting the difference in<br>
antigenicity between bacterial species using one<br>
molecule as a standard is not known.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention strives to present<br>
antibodies to the same molecule for different<br>
microorganisms as a standard marker antigen to make<br>
ideal microorganism detection and immunodiagnosis<br>
possible, particularly antibodies -to the molecular<br>
segment in the same intracellular functional<br>
component molecule for all microorganisms to be<br>
detected that changes during the course of evolution<br>
of microorganisms, a method of detecting<br>
microorganisms, which is species specific and can<br>
cover almost all serum types, a reagent kit for<br>
detection of microorganisms that use said antibody,<br>
and a method for preparing a specific antibody used<br>
for detection of microorganisms.<br>
The present inventors discovered a protein with<br>
the same function, preserved in all microorganisms as<br>
a useful antigen protein. Usually, it is expected<br>
that a structural change of such a protein is<br>
extremely small. However, surprisingly it was found<br>
that the antigen epitope(s) of this protein has<br>
specificity to certain species or genus of<br>
microorganisms, and that the antibody for this<br>
protein not only has potentialities of being used for<br>
specifically identifying species or genus of<br>
microorganisms, but also is capable of detecting all<br>
serotypes of the target microorganisms.<br>
»<br>
The inventors focused on intracellular molecule<br>
that are present in all microbial cells and differ<br>
between microorganisms in terms of its amino acid<br>
sequence, particularly ribosomal protein L7/L12,<br>
which is a member of ribosomal proteins . Ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 is a protein with a molecular weight<br>
of approximately 13 kilo Daltons and is known to<br>
exist as a ribosomal protein essential in protein<br>
synthesis. Progress has been made in understanding<br>
the complete amino acid sequence of the protein from<br>
several microorganisms including particularly<br>
Escherichia  coli  and Baccillus  subtilus, etc., and 50<br>
% to 65 % homology of the amino acid sequence between<br>
the microorganisms has been confirmed.<br>
The inventors focused on the fact that even<br>
though there are similarities in said molecule<br>
between different microorganisms., this molecule also<br>
has a structural segment that is unique to each<br>
microorganism and discovered that it is possible to<br>
detect various microorganisms with species<br>
specificity and to detect all serotypes within the<br>
same species by using antibody to the protein. As a<br>
result of attempting to develop a technology for<br>
immuno-diagnosis of microorganism species using<br>
antibody specific to, for instance, Haemophilus<br>
influenzae,  Streptococcus pneumoniae,  and Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae,  the inventors completed the present<br>
invention upon discovering that antibody specific to<br>
said protein of each species of microorganisms can be<br>
obtained and species-specific detection of different<br>
bacteria is possible using said antibody. <br>
The present invention relates to an antibody used<br>

Moreover, the series of biomolecular experiments<br>
of gene preparation mentioned in this text can be<br>
performed by methods entered in standard experimental<br>
manuals. "Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual,"<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Sambrook, J. et<br>
al. (1989), is an example of the aforementioned<br>
standard experimental manual.<br>
The term microorganism in "the present invention<br>
refers to all species of microorganisms , including<br>
bacteria, yeast, mold, Actinomyces, rickettsia, etc.,<br>
but bacteria in particular, pose a problem in terms<br>
of diagnosis of microbial infections.<br>
The term "antibody which reacts specifically with<br>
microorganisms" as used in the present invention<br>
means an antibody, which reacts specifically with a<br>
species or group of microorganisms. An antibody,<br>
which reacts specifically with a species of<br>
microorganisms, is particularly useful for the<br>
diagnosis of microbial infection diseases.<br>
In the present invention, causative<br>
microorganisms of STD (sexually transmitted disease)<br>
include, but are not limited to, Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae,  Chlamydia  trachomatis,  Candida  albicans,<br>
Treponema pallidum,  and Ureaplasma  urealyticum.<br>
In the present invention, causative<br>
microorganisms of respiratory tract infection<br>
include, but are not limited to, Haemophilus<br>
influenzae,  Streptococcus pneumoniae,  Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae,  Mycoplasma pneumoniae,  Klebsiella<br>
pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa,  Streptococcus, sp,  Group—A,  Mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis,  Legionella pneumophila,  and Aspergillus<br>
spp.<br>
The term antibody in the present invention means<br>
a polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody that can<br>
be made using the entire length or only a partial<br>
peptide of said ribosomal protein. Although there are<br>
no special restrictions to the peptide length for<br>
making the antibody, the segment should be of the<br>
length characterizing the ribosomal protein L7/L12,<br>
and a peptide of 5 amino acids or longer,<br>
particularly 8 amino acids or longer, is preferred.<br>
Antiserum containing antibody (polyclonal antibody)<br>
that identifies ribosomal protein L7/L12 can be<br>
obtained by inoculating laboratory animals with<br>
adjuvant and a peptide or the full length protein as<br>
it is or when necessary, after being cross linked<br>
with a carrier protein such as KLH (keyhole-limpet<br>
hemocyanin) and BSA (bovine serum albumin) and<br>
recovering the serum. Moreover, the antibody can be<br>
used after it has been purified from the antiserum.<br>
The laboratory animals that are inoculated include<br>
sheep, horses, goats, rabbits, mice, rats, etc. , and<br>
sheep, rabbits, etc., are particularly preferred for<br>
preparation of polyclonal antibody. Moreover,<br>
monoclonal antibody can also be obtained by<br>
conventional methods of making hybridoma cells, but<br>
mice are preferred in this case. The entire length<br>
of the said protein, or its partial peptide<br>
consisting amino acid residues of 5 or more.<br>
preferably 8 or more, residues that has been fused<br>
with GST (glutathione S-transferase), etc., can be<br>
purified and used as antigen, or it can be used as<br>
antigen without being purified. The antibody can<br>
also be the genetic recombination antibody expressed<br>
cellularly using immunoglobulin genes that have been<br>
separated by a variety of methods in manuals<br>
("Antibodies: A Laboratory manual," E. Harlow et<br>
al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), cloning methods,<br>
etc.<br>
Antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12 that can be<br>
employed as the marker antigen of the present<br>
invention can be obtained by the following 3 methods,<br>
and other similar methods as well. The methods,<br>
however, are not limited to these.<br>
a) The desired antibody can be acquired by<br>
synthesizing a peptide fragment consisting of 5-30<br>
amino acids for microorganisms with a known ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 genetic sequence and amino acid<br>
sequence using the region least similar to the amino<br>
acid sequence of said protein of another<br>
microorganisms and making polyclonal antibody, or<br>
monoclonal antibody, using this peptide fragment as<br>
the immunogen.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to acquire the entire<br>
sequence of said gene by using a conventional genetic<br>
procedure, such as gene amplification by PCR with the<br>
DNA sequence at both terminals of said known genetic<br>
sequence as the probe, or hybridization using the<br>
sequence of a homologous segment as the template<br>
probe.<br>
Then, a fused gene with another protein gene is<br>
constructed and said fused gene is inserted into the<br>
host by conventional gene insertion methods using<br>
Escherichia  coli,  etc., as the host and expressed in<br>
large quantities. The desired protein antigen can<br>
then be acquired by purifying the expressed protein<br>
by affinity column methods with antibody to the<br>
protein that was used as the fusion protein. In such<br>
a case, even if antibody to the amino acid segment<br>
conserved within microorganisms is acquired, it does<br>
not coincide with the purpose of the present<br>
invention because the full length of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 becomes the antigen. Consequently,<br>
hybridoma that produces monoclonal antibody to the<br>
antigen that has been obtained by this method is<br>
acquired by conventional methods and the desired<br>
antibody can be obtained by selecting a clone that<br>
produces antibody that will react only with the<br>
desired microorganisms.<br>
b) First, since there is 50 to 60% homology<br>
between bacterial species in terms of their ribosomal.<br>
protein L7/L12 amino acid sequence, it is possible to<br>
easily acquire said protein genes for microorganisms<br>
with unknown L7/L12 amino acid sequence by-<br>
conventional genetic procedures, such as gene<br>
amplification of a specific sequence segment by FCR<br>
methods based on the sequence of the homologous<br>
segments of the amino acid sequence, or hybridization<br>
with the homologous segments as the template probe,<br>
using bacteria having a known ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 amino acid sequence.<br>
Then, a fused gene with another protein gene is<br>
constructed and said fused gene is inserted into the<br>
host by conventional gene , insertion methods using<br>
Escherichia  coli,  etc., as the host and expressed in<br>
large quantities. The desired protein antigen can<br>
then be acquired by purifying the expressed protein<br>
by affinity column methods with antibody to the<br>
protein that was used as the fusion protein. In such<br>
a case, even if antibody to the amino acid segment<br>
conserved within microorganisms is acquired, it does<br>
not coincide with the purpose of the present<br>
inv-ention because th-e full length of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 becomes the antigen. Consequently,<br>
hybridoma that produces monoclonal antibody to the<br>
antigen that has been obtained by this method is<br>
acquired by conventional methods and the desired<br>
antibody can be obtained by selecting a clone that<br>
produces antibody that will react only with the<br>
desired microorganisms.<br>
c) Ribosomal protein L7/L12 that has been<br>
purified to a high purity can also be obtained by<br>
another method, in the case where the amino acid<br>
sequence of the ribosomal protein L7/L12 is unknown<br>
whereby a peptide of 5 to 30 amino acids<br>
corresponding to the common sequence segment retained<br>
in the microorganisms is synthesized from the known<br>
amino acid sequence of the ribosomal protein L7/L12,<br>
and polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody to<br>
this peptide sequence is made by conventional<br>
methods. Then the highly purified Ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 from disrupted microorganisms is obtained by<br>
affinity column chromatography using said antibody.<br>
If purity of the protein is insuf f icieTit, it can<br>
be purified by conventional methods, such as ion<br>
exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography,<br>
gel filtration, etc., after which the eluted fraction<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 is identified by western<br>
blotting, etc., using antibody that was made to<br>
obtain the pure fraction. The desired antibody can be<br>
obtained by acquiring hybridoma or polyclanal<br>
antibody by conventional methods using the pure<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 antigen that has been<br>
obtained and selecting hybridoma or polyclonal<br>
antibody that will react specifically with the<br>
desired bacteria, as in b).<br>
The antibody of the present invention specific to<br>
a variety of microorganisms that has been obtained by<br>
the methods in a) through c), etc., can be used in a<br>
variety of immunoassay methods to obtain diagnostic<br>
reagent kits specific to a- variety of microorganisms.<br>
For example, this antibody can be used in aggregation<br>
reactions where antibody is adsorbed on polystyrene<br>
latex particles, ELISA, which is a conventional<br>
technology performed in a microtiter plate,<br>
conventional immunochromatography methods, sandwich<br>
assay, whereby said antibody labeled with colored<br>
particles or particles that have coloring capability,<br>
or with enzyme or phosphor, and magnetic<br>
microparticles coated with capture antibody, etc.,<br>
are used, etc.<br>
The term detection methods for microorganism<br>
using antibody means detection methods that use<br>
conventional immunoassay such as aggregation<br>
reactions where antibody is adsorbed on polystyrene<br>
latex particles, ELISA, which is a conventional<br>
technology performed in a microtiter plate,<br>
conventional immunochromatography methods, sandwich<br>
assay, whereby said antibody labeled with colored<br>
particles or particles that have coloring capability,<br>
or with enzyme or phosphor, and magnetic<br>
microparticles coated with capture antibody, etc.,<br>
are used, etc.<br>
Moreover, the optical immunoassay (OIA)<br>
technology described in International Patent<br>
Application Japanese Laid-open (Toku-Hyou) No.<br>
509565/1995, in which microorganisms are detected by<br>
an optical interference induced by an antibody<br>
reaction on the optical thin film which is formed by<br>
silicone or silicon nitride, is a useful detection<br>
method using an antibody.<br>
Moreover, treatment with an extraction reagent<br>
that uses a variety of surfactants, beginning with<br>
Triton X-100 and Tween-20, enzyme treatment with an<br>
appropriate enzyme, such as protease, etc., known<br>
methods whereby the cell structure is disrupted,<br>
beginning with disruption of the microorganism by<br>
physical methods, can be used to extract the<br>
intracellular marker antigen from the necessary<br>
microorganism in said detection method. However, it<br>
is preferred that the extraction conditions be<br>
designed using a combination of surfactants, etc., so<br>
that the conditions are optimized for extraction of<br>
each microorganism with reagents.<br>
Moreover, the term a reagent kit for detection of<br>
microorganisms using antibody means a reagent kit<br>
that uses said detection method.<br>
For instance, in the case of obtaining the<br>
specific antibody to Haemophilus  influenzae,  which is<br>
of extreme diagnostic significance as a causative<br>
pathogen of pneumonia, bronchitis, meningitis, etc.,<br>
the amino acid sequence and DNA sequence of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 is entered in data bases, etc.<br>
The amino acid and DNA sequence of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus influenzae  are shown in<br>
"Sequences No. 1 and No. 2."<br>
Consequently, in the case of this bacteria, it is<br>
possible to similarly compare the amino acid sequence<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 with the same protein of,<br>
for instance, Helicobacter pylori,  which is shown in<br>
"Sequence No. 3 and No. 4," and synthesize a peptide<br>
of 5 to 30 amino acids for the segment of low<br>
homology and make polyclonal antibody or monoclonal<br>
antibody specific to Haemophilus  influenzae  using<br>
this peptide.<br>
In the case of a specific polyclonal antibody, it<br>
is preferred that IgG fraction be obtained by<br>
purification of the antiserum of immunized laboratory<br>
animals with a protein A column, etc., and affinity<br>
purification be performed with the synthetic peptide<br>
uses in immunization of the laboratory animals.<br>
Moreover, PCR primers based on the sequences o-f<br>
N-terminal and C-terminal, for example, the PCR<br>
primers shown in Sequences No. 11 and No. 12 in the<br>
Sequence Table, were designed from the DNA sequence<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus<br>
influenzae.  Utilizing homology of the PCR primers,<br>
DNA fragments amplified by the PCR method or the like<br>
using genomic DNA which is extracted from cultivated<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae  can be acquired by a<br>
conventional method. The entire length of the gene<br>
for ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus<br>
influenzae  can be acquired by the analysis of the DNA<br>
sequence information of these fragments.<br>
The ribosomal protein L7/L12 gene of Haemophilus<br>
influenzae  thus acquired forms a fusion protein gene<br>
with, for instance, GST etc., and expression vector<br>
 is constructed using the appropriate expression<br>
plasmid, Escherichia  coli  is transformed and large<br>
quantities of said protein can be expressed. A<br>
suitable amount of the transformed Escherichia  coli<br>
is cultivated and the crushed bacterial fluid that is<br>
 recovered is purified by an affinity column using GST<br>
to obtain the ribosomal protein L7/L12 and GST fusion<br>
protein of Haemophilus  influenzae.  It is also<br>
possible to acquire the target specific monoclonal<br>
antibody by establishing piural hybridojnas using said<br>
protein as it .Ls or GST moiety fragments cut from the<br>
protein by pxcrteas-e- or the like, as an antigen<br>
protein and selecting the antibody which exhibits a<br>
specific response to Haemophilus  influenzae bacteria,<br>
or a disrupt fluid of the bacteria, or ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus  influenzae.<br>
Moreover, the amino acid sequence and the DNA<br>
sequence of ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae  which is also highly significant as a<br>
diagnostic agent for respiratory infection diseases<br>
as well as Haemophilus  influenzae, are known from<br>
de-scriptions in data bases and the like. The amino<br>
acid and DNA sequences of ribosomal protein L7/L12 of<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae  are  shown in Sequences No. 5<br>
and No. 6 of sequence table.<br>
It is therefore possible to acquire a polyclonal<br>
antibody or monoclonal antibody which is specific to<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae  by designing a PCR primer,<br>
the PCR primer shown by Sequence ID No. 13 or 14 in<br>
the Sequence Table, for example, based on the<br>
sequences of N-terminai and C-terminal of DNA<br>
sequence of ^Ribosomal Proteins L7/L12 of<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae  in the same manner as in the<br>
case Of Haemophilus  influenzae, and processing<br>
thereafter in the same manner as in the case of<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae.<br>

pneumoniae  rras tee-n deposited with the Rational<br>
Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, the<br>
Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, the<br>

6807.<br>
Moreover, although the DNA and amino acid<br>
sequences of the ribosomal protein L7/L12 of, for<br>
instance, Neisseria  gonorrhoeae, which is the<br>
causative pathogen of gonorrhea and has be-en shown to<br>
have diagnostic significance as a typical causative<br>
pathogen of STD, were unknown, a major part of the<br>
DNA sequence and amino acid sequence, which was<br>
determined by the Neisseria Gonorrhea Genome Project<br>
at Oklahoma University, USA, is disclosed on the<br>
Internet.<br>
When part of the known DNA sequence of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 was used to probe the existence of DNA<br>
fragments with a similar sequence, it was found that<br>
DNA sequence corresponding to the ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 gene is present and it was possible to obtain<br>
data on its entire DNA sequence. The entire base<br>
sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 gene of this Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae  are shown in Sequences No. 7 and No. 8 of<br>
the sequence table.<br>
It is therefore possible to acquire the target<br>
antibody which is specific to Neisseria  gonorrhoeae<br>
having the entire or partial Ribosomal Protein L7/L12<br>
of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  as an antigen by designing a<br>
PCR primer, the PCR primer shown by Sequence ID No.<br>
15 or 16 in the Sequence Table, for example, based on<br>
the sequences of N-terminal and C-terminal of DNA<br>
sequence of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae  in the same manner as in the case of<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae,<br>
and processing thereafter in exactly the s-ame manner<br>
as in the case of Haemophilus  influenzae  or<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae.<br>
Particularly, the gene sequence of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of Neisseria  meningitides,  which<br>
belongs to the same Neisseria  genus as Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae  is disclosed and readily available on the<br>
Internet. The entire base sequence and the<br>
corresponding amino acid sequence of the ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 gene of Neisseria  meningitidis  are<br>
shown in "Sequences No. 9 and No. 10." Here,<br>
comparing the entire base sequence for ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 genes of Neisseria  meningitidis  and<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,  only difference in the amino<br>
acid sequence is that Neisseria gonorrhoeae has<br>
alanine for the 115th amino acid from the N-terminal,<br>
whereas Neisseria  meningitidis  has glutamic acid.<br>
Therefore, It can be concluded that the antibody for<br>
the ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae<br>
which can specifically detects Neisseria  gonorrhoeae<br>
is the antibody which identifies alanine at 115 from<br>
the N-terminal and the amino acid region including<br>
the alanine of ribosomal protein L7/L12 as an<br>
epitope.<br>
Antibody made based on the present invention can<br>
be used in all known types of immunoassay, such as<br>
aggregation whereby said antibody is adsorbed on<br>
polystyrene latex, ELISA, which is a conventional<br>
technology performed in a microtiter plate,<br>
conventional immunochromatography, sandwich assay,<br>
whereby said antibody labeled with colored particles<br>
or particles that have coloring capability, or<br>
enzymes ox phosphor, and magnetic particles coated<br>
with capture antibody are used, etc.<br>
Moreover, antibody that is made based on the<br>
present invention can simultaneously function in any<br>
of these immunoassay methods as a so-called capture<br>
antibody that captures said antigen protein in solid<br>
or liquid phase and a so-called enzyme-labeled<br>
antibody by modification using an enzyme, such as<br>
peroxidase and alkali phosphatase, etc., by<br>
conventional methods.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples are given to explain the<br>
present invention in actual term-s, the present<br>
invention not  being restricted to these examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Cloning of ribosomal protein L7/L12 genes from<br>
Haemophilus influenzae<br>
After inoculating an appropriate amount of<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae  strain ATCC9334 (IID984)<br>
(obtained from Tokyo University School of Medicine<br>
Laboratories) in a chocolate agar culture medium, the<br>
strain was cultivated for 24 hours in a CO2 incubator<br><br>
under conditions of 37oc and 5.0% CO2. The<br>
colonies that grew were suspended in a TE buffer<br>
(manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.) to a<br>
final concentration of approximately 5 x 109 CFU/ml.<br>
Approximately 1.5 ml of this suspension was<br>
transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged<br>
for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was<br>
discarded. The sediment was resuspended in 567 \xl  TE<br>
buffer. Then 30 ml 10 % sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)<br>
and 3 ml 20 mg/ml Proteinase K solution were added<br>
and thoroughly mixed. The suspension was incubated<br>
for another hour at 37°C. Next, after adding 80 ul<br>
10 % cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide/0.7 M NaCl<br>
solution and thoroughly mixing the product, it was<br>
incubated for 10 minutes at 65 °C. Next, 700 Ml<br>
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution at a volume ratio<br>
of 24:1 was added and stirred well. The solution was<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes (while being kept at 4°C)<br>
at 12,000 rpm using a microcentrifugation device and<br>
the aqueous fraction was transferred to a new<br>
microtube. Isopropanol was added to the fraction at<br>
0.6-times its volume and the tube was vigorously<br>
shaken to form sediment of the DNA. The white DNA<br>
sediment was scooped with a glass rod and transferred<br>
to a different microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml<br>
70 % ethanol (cooled to -20 °C) .<br>
Next, the product was centrifuged for 5 minutes<br>
at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was gently removed.<br>
Then another 1 ml 70 % ethanol was added and the<br>
product was centrifuged for 5 more minutes.<br>
Once the supernatant had been removed, the<br>
sediment was dissolved in 100 ml TE buffer to obtain<br>
the DNA solution. The concentration of the genomic<br>
DNA solution was determined quantitatively according<br>
to E5, Spectrophotometric determination of the amount<br>
of DNA or RNA "Molecular cloning: A laboratory<br>
manual," 1989, Eds. Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F., and<br>
Maniatis, T., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.<br>
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was performed<br>
using 10 ng of this genomic DNA. Taq polymerase<br>
(Takara Co., ltd., code R001A) was employed for PCR.<br>
Then 5 ul of buffer, 4 ul dNTP mixture, and 200 pmol<br>
each of synthetic oligonucleotide-A, shown in<br>
Sequence No. 11 of the Sequence Table and synthetic<br>
oligonucleotide-B, shown in Sequence No. 12 of the<br>
Sequence table, were added to the enzyme to bring the<br>
final volume to 50 ml.<br>
This mixture was cycled 5 times with a TaKaRa PCR<br>
Thermal Cycler 480 for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes<br>
at 50 °C, and 3 minutes at 72 °C and was then cycled<br>
25 times for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes at 60 °C,<br>
and 3 minutes at 72 °C. Electrophoresis was performed<br>
in 1.5 % agarose gel using some of this PCR product.<br>
This product was then stained with ethidium bromide<br>
(Ninon Gene Co., ltd.) and observed under ultraviolet.<br>
rays to confirm amplification of approximately 400 bp<br>
cDNA. After digestion treatment with restriction<br>
endonucleases BamHI and Xhol, electrophoresis was<br>
performed in 1.5 % agarose gel and staining with<br>
ethidium bromide was carried out. An approximately<br>
370 bp band was cut out from the gel. This band was<br>
purified with SuprecOl (Takara Co., Ltd.) and then<br>
inserted into pGEX-4T-l (Pharmacia), which is a<br>
commercial vector. This same vector can function as<br>
an expression vector for the desired molecule, which<br>
can express fused protein with GST protein, by<br>
insertion of the desired gene fragment into the<br>
appropriate restriction endonuclease site.<br>
Actually, vector pGEX-4T-l and the previous DNA<br>
were mixed together at a molar ratio of 1:3 and DNA<br>
was inserted into the vector with T4 DNA ligase<br>
(Invitrogen Co.). Vector pGEX-4T-l into which DNA<br>
had been inserted was genetically introduced to<br>
Escherichia  coli  one-shot competent cells (Invitrogen<br>
Co., Ltd.) and then inoculated in a plate of L-Broth<br>
(Takara Co., Ltd.) semi-sold culture plate containing<br>
50 ug/ml ampicillin (Sigma). The plate was then set-<br>
aside at 37 °C for 12 hours and the colonies that<br>
grew were selected at random and inoculated into 2 ml<br>
L-Broth liquid culture medium containing the same<br>
concentration of ampicillin. Shake cultivation was<br>
performed at 37 °C for 8 hours and the bacteria were<br>
recovered and the plasmid was separated using Wizard<br>
Miniprep (Promega) in accordance with the attached<br>
literature. The plasmid was cleaved with restriction<br>
endonuclease BamHI/XhoI. Insertion of said PCR<br>
product was confirmed by cutting out approximately<br>
370 bp DNA. The base sequence of the DNA that had<br>
been inserted was determined using said clone.<br>
Determination of the base sequence of the<br>
inserted DNA fragment was performed using the<br>
Fluorescence Sequencer of Applied Biosystems. The<br>
sequence sample was prepared using PRISM, Ready<br>
Reaction Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied<br>
Biosystems). First, 9.5 ml reaction stock solution,<br>
4.0 ml T7 promoter primer at 0.8 pmol/ml (Gibco BRL)<br>
and 6.5 ml of template DNA for sequencing at 0.16<br>
mg/ml were added to a microtube with a capacity of<br>
0.5 ml, mixed ana superposed with 100 ml mineral oil.<br>
PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles, where<br>
one cycle consisted, of 30 seconds at 96 °C, 15<br>
seconds at 55 °C, and 4 minutes at 60 °C. The product<br>
was then kept at 4 °C for 5 minutes . After the<br>
reaction was completed, 80 ml sterilized pure water<br>
was added and stirred. The product was centrifuged<br>
and the aqueous layer was extracted 3 times with<br><br>
phenol-chloroform. 10ml 3 M sodium<br>
acetate (pH 5.2) and 300 ml ethanol were added to 100<br>
ml aqueous Layer- and starred. The product was then<br>
centrifuged for 15 minutes at room temperature and<br>
14,000 rpm and the sediment was recovered. Once the<br>
sediment was washed with 75 % ethanol, it was dried<br>
under a vacuum for 2 minutes to obtain the sequencing<br>
sample. The sequencing sample was dissolved in<br>
formamide containing 4 ml 10 mM EDTA and denatured<br>
for 2 minutes at 90 °C. This was then cooled in ice<br>
and applied to sequencing.<br>
One of the 5 clones obtained had homology of the<br>
sequence with the probe used for PCR. In addition,<br>
DNA sequences extremely similar to the gene sequence<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 gene of the other<br>
microorganisms, for example, Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,<br>
were discovered. The entire base sequence and the<br>
corresponding amino acid sequence of the structural<br>
gene moiety are as shown in Sequence ID No. 17 and<br>
No. 18 of the Sequence Table. This gene "fragment<br>
clearly codes for Haemophilus  influenzae ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12.<br>
Example 2<br>
Mass expression in Escherichia  coli  and purification<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 from Haemophilus<br>
influenzae<br>
Fifty milliliters Escherichia  coli  into which<br>
expression vector had been inserted were cultivated<br>
overnight in LB at 37°C. Then 500 ml YT medium at<br>
cancentration that was twice that of the<br>
aforementioned culture was heated at 37 °C "for 1<br>
hour. Fifty milliliters of the Escherichia coli<br>
solution that had been cultivated overnight were<br>
introduced to 500 ml of the aforementioned medium.<br>
One hour later, 550 |ul 100 mM isopropyl ($-(D)-<br>
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were introduced and<br>
cultivated for 4 hours. The product was then<br>
recovered and introduced to centrifugatiorr tube at<br>
each 250 ml and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 7,000<br>
rpm.<br>
The supernatant was discarded and dissolved in 25<br>
ml each 50 mM Tris-HCl at a pH of 7.4 and Lysis<br>
buffer containing 25 % sucrose.<br>
Furthermore, 1.25 ml 10 % Nonidet P-40 (NP-40)<br>
and 125 |il 1 M MgCl2 were added and transferred to a<br>
plastic tube. Sonication was performed 1 minute x 5<br>
times while ice cold. The product was centrifuged<br>
for 15 minutes at 12,000 rpm and the supernatant vrars<br>
recovered.<br>
Next, the aforementioned supernatant was adsorbed<br>
on a glutathione agarose column conditioned with<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).<br>
Then the column was washed with twice the bed<br>
volume using a washing solution containing 20 mM Tris<br>
buffer at a pH of 7.4, 4.2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM<br>
dithiothreithol (DTT). Elution was performed with 50<br>
mM Tris buffer at a pH of 9.6 containing 5 mM<br>
glutathione. The protein content in the fraction was<br>
determined by the pigment bonding method (Bradford<br>
method; BioRad Co.) and the main fraction was<br>
acquired.<br>
Purity of the purified ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12/GST fused protein that was obtained was<br>
confirmed by electrophoresis to be approximately 75<br>
%, showing that a purity satisfactory for an<br>
immunogen could be guaranteed.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of monoclonal antibody to ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus  influenzae<br>
First, 100 ng fused protein antigen of ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12/GST of Haemophilus  influenzae  were<br>
dissolved in 200 Hi PBS and then 200 \il  Freund's<br>
complete adjuvant were added and mixed and<br>
emulsif .Lcation was performed. Two-hundred<br>
microliters were injected intraperitoneally to<br>
immunize mice.<br>
Then the same emulsion antigen was<br>
intraperitoneally injected after 2 weeks, after 4<br>
weeks, and after 6 weeks. Two-fold the concentration<br>
of antigen emulsion was injected intraperitoneally<br>
after 10 weeks and after 14 weeks. The spleen was<br>
excised 3 days after the final immunization and<br>
submitted to cell fusion.<br>
After thoroughly mixing 2 x 107 myeloma cells per<br>
108 spleen cells from mice, which had been recovered<br>
aseptically, in a glass tube, the mixture was<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1,500 rpm and the<br>
supernatant was discarded. The cells were thoroughly<br>
mixed.<br>
The myeloma cells used for cell fusion were<br>
obtained by cultivation of cell strain NS-1 with an<br>
RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10 % FCS,<br>
cultivating this product beginning 2 weeks before<br>
cell fusion using an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.13<br>
mM azaguanine, 0.5 ng/ml MC-210, and 10 % FCS for 1<br>
weeks, and then further cultivating the cell strain<br>
for 1 week with an RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 %<br>
FCS .<br>
Thirty milliliters of RPMI 1640 culture medium 50<br>
ml that had been kept at 37 °C were added to the<br>
mixed cell sample and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm.<br>
After removal of the supernatant, 1 ml 50 %<br>
polyethylene glycol that had been kept at 37 °C was<br>
added and stirred for 2 minute. 10 ml RPMI 1640<br>
medium kept at 37 °C were added and the solution was<br>
vigorously mixed for approximately 5 minutes as it<br>
was suctioned and evacuated from a sterile pipette.<br>
After centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1,000 rpm<br>
and removal of the supernatant, 30 ml HAT medium were<br>
added to bring the cell concentration to 5 x 106<br>
cells/ml. This mixture was stirred till uniform and<br>
then poured, 0.1 ml at a time, into a 96-well culture<br>
plate and cultivated at 37 °C under 7 % CO2. HAT<br>
medium was added, 0.1 ml at a time, on Day 1 and at<br>
Week 1 and Week 2.<br>
Then the cells that had produced the desired<br>
antibody were screened by ELISA.<br>
Solutions of GST fusion ribosomal protein L7/L12<br>
and GST protein of Haemophilus  influenzae  dissolved<br>
in PBS containing 0.05 % sodium azide diluted to 10<br>
mg/ml were poured, each 100 ml at a time, into<br>
separate 96-well plates and adsorbed overnight at 4<br>
°C.<br>
After removal of the supernatant, 200 ml of 1 %<br>
bovine serum albumin solution (in PBS) were added and<br>
reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
After removal of the supernatant, the product was<br>
washed with washing, solution (0.02 % Tween 20, PBS).<br>
One-hundred microliters culture solution of fused<br>
cells were added to this and reacted for 2 hours at<br>
room temperature. The supernatant was removed and<br>
washed with washing solution. Next, 100 ml<br>
pero-xidase-labeied goat anti-mouse IgG antibody<br>
solution at a concentration of 50 ng/ml were added<br>
and the solution was reacted for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant was removed and the<br>
product was again washed with washing solution. Then<br>
TMB solution (KPL Co., ltd) was added, 100 ml at a<br>
time, and the mixture was reacted for 20 minutes at<br>
room temperature. After coloration, 100 \xl  1 N<br>
sulfuric acid were added to stop the reaction and<br>
absorbance at 450 nm was determined.<br>
As a result, positive wells that only reacted<br>
with GST fusion ribosomal protein L7/L12 and did not<br>
react with GST protein were detected, and it was<br>
concluded that antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12<br>
is present.<br>
Therefore, the cells in the positive wells were<br>
recovered and cultivated with HAT medium in a 24-well<br>
plastic plate. The fused medium that had been<br>
cultivated was diluted with HT medium to a cell count<br>
of approximately 20 cells/ml and then mixed with 106<br>
six-week-old mouse thyroid cells suspended in HT<br>
Cultivation medium in a 96-well culture plate.<br>
Culture was performed for 2 weeks at 37 °C under<br>
conditions of 7 % CO2.<br>
Antibody activity in the culture supernatant was<br>
similarly determined by the aforementioned ELISA<br>
method and the cells that showed positive reaction<br>
with ribosomal protein L7/L12 were recovered.<br>
Furthermore, the same dilution test and cloning<br>
procedure was repeated to obtain a total of 5 clones<br>
of hybridoma HIRB-1 ~ 5.<br>
Example 4<br>
Reaction of monoclonal antibody that reacts with<br>
rifoosomal protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus  influenzae,<br>
with Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  and other microorganisms<br>
Monoclonal antibody was produced and recovered in<br>
accordance with standard methods using the positive<br>
hybridoma cells obtained as previously described.<br>
Basically, 5 x 106 cells that had been<br>
subcultured using RPMI 1640 culture medium<br>
«<br>
(containing 10 % FCS) were intraperitoneally injected<br>
into Balb/C mice that had been intraperitoneally<br>
injected with 0.5 ml Pxistane 2 weeks earlier.<br>
Ascites was recovered 3 weeks later and the<br>
centrifugation supernatant was obtained.<br>
The solution containing antibody that was<br>
obtained was adsorbed in a Protein A column (5 ml<br>
bed, Pharmacia) and washed with 3-bed volume of PBS.<br>
Then eluted with citrate buffer at pH 3, the antibody<br>
fraction was recovered and the monoclonal antibody<br>
produced by each hybridoma was obtained.<br>
The monoclonal antibody derived from these 5<br>
strains of hybridoma was used in ELISA.<br>
The sandwich assay method was used to assess the<br>
monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody that<br>
was prepared was used as an enzyme-labeled antibody<br>
by being chemically bound to peroxidase.<br>
That is, enzyme labeling was performed in<br>
accordance with the method in "Analytical<br>
Biochemistry" 132 (1983) , 68-73 with the reagent S-<br>
acetylthioacetic acid N-hydroxysucciaimide for<br>
binding using horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Grade<br>
VI). By means of the ELISA reaction, a solution of<br>
commercial anti-Haemophilus influenzae  polyclonal<br>
antibody which dissolved in FBS containing 0.05 %<br>
sodium azide, (Biodesign, rabbit) was diluted to a<br>
concentration of 10 mg/ml and poured,100 ml at a<br>
time, into a separate 96-well plate and adsorbed<br>
overnight at 4°C.<br>
After removal of the supernatant, 200 ml 1 % FCS<br>
solution (in PBS) were added and reacted and blocked<br>
for 1 hour at room temperature. The supernatant was<br>
removed and the product was washed with washing<br>
solution (0.02 % Tween 20, PBS). One-hundred<br>
microliters of antigen solution, which had been<br>
obtained by adding Triton X-10C to culture solutions<br>
of each species of microorganism  to a concentration<br>
of 0.3 % and then extracting the solution for 5<br>
minutes at room temperature, were added to this and<br>
reacted for 2 hours at room temperature. The<br>
supernatant was removed and the product was further<br>
washed with washing solution. Then 100 ml<br>
peroxidase-labeled anti-ribosomal protein L7/L12<br>
antibody solution at 5 mg/ml were added and reacted<br>
for 1 hour at room temperature. The supernatant was<br>
removed and the product was washed with washing<br>
solution. 1MB (KPL Co.) solution was added, 100 |il at<br>
a time, and reacted for 2 0 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After coloration, 100 |il 1 N sulfuric<br>
acid were added to stop the reaction. Absorbance at<br>
450 nm was determined.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 1 it is clear that<br>
when monoclonal antibody derived from hybridoma HIRB-<br>
2 was used as the enzyme-labeled antibody, all<br>
strains of Haemophilus  influenzae  tested were<br>
detected at a sensitivity of 106 bacteria/ml, while<br>
reactivity of other bacteria belonging ~to "the genus<br>
Neisseria  and other microorganisms could not be<br>
detected, even at high concentrations of 108<br>
bacteria/ml and therefore, antibody with specific<br>
reactivity to Haemophilus  influenzae  can be obtained<br>
by using monoclonal antibody to ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12.<br>

Cloning of ribosomal protein L7/L12 genes from<br>
Streptococcus pneumponiae, mass expression in<br>
Escherichia  coli  and purification of the same protein<br>
and preparation of monoclonal antibody to the same<br>
protein<br>
After inoculating an appropriate amount of<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae  strain IID555 (obtained from<br>
Tokyo University School of Medicine Laboratories) in<br>
a blood agar culture medium, the strain was<br>
cultivated for 48 hours in an incubator at 37 °C. The<br>
colonies that grew were suspended in a TE buffer to a<br>
final concentration of approximately 5 x 109 CFU/ml.<br>
Approximately 1.5 ml of this suspension was<br>
transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged<br>
for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was<br>
discarded. The sediment was resuspended in 567 ul TE<br>
buffer. Then 30 ul 10 % SDS and 3 ul 20 mg/ml<br>
Proteinase K solution were added and thoroughly<br>
mixed. The suspension was incubated for another hour<br>
at 37 °C. Next, after adding 80 ml 10 % cetyl<br>
trimethyl ammonium bromide/0.7 M NaCl solution and<br>
thoroughly mixing the product, it was incubated for<br>
10 minutes at 65 °C. Next, 700 ul chloroform-isoamyl<br>
alcohol solution at a volume ratio of 24:1 was added<br>
and stirred well. The solution was centrifuged for 5<br>
minutes (while being kept at 4 °C) at 12,000 rpm<br>
using a microcentrifugation device and the aqueous<br>
fraction was transferred to a new microtube.<br>
Isopropanol was added to the fraction at 0.6-times<br>
its volume and the tube was vigorously shaken to form<br>
sediment of the DNA. The white DNA sediment was<br>
scooped with a glass rod and transferred to a<br>
different microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml 70 %<br>
ethanol (cooled to -20 °C)<br>
Next, the product was centrifuged for 5 minutes<br>
at 1.0,000 rpm and the supernatant was gently removed.<br>
Then another 1 ml 7 0 % ethanol was added and the<br>
product was centrifuged for 5 more minutes. Once the<br>
supernatant had been removed, the sediment was<br>
dissolved in 100 ml TE buffer to obtain the DNA<br>
solution. The concentration of the genomic DNA<br>
solution was determined quantitatively in accordance<br>
with E5, Spectrophotometric determination of the<br>
amount of DNA or RNA, "Molecular cloning: A<br>
laboratory manual," 1989, Eds. Sambrook, J., Fritsch,<br>
E.F., and Maniatis, T., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press.<br>
PCR was performed using 10 ng of this genomic<br>
DNA. Taq polymerase (Takara Co., ltd., code R001A)<br>
was employed for PCR.  Then 5 ul of buffer attached<br>
to enzyme, 4 ml dNTP mixture attached to enzyme, and<br>
200 pmol each of synthetic oligonucleotide C shown in<br>
Sequence No. 13 of the Sequence Table and synthetic<br>
oligonucleotide D shown in Sequence No. 14 of the<br>
Sequence table were added to the enzyme to bring the<br>
final volume to 50 ml.<br>
This mixture was cycled 5 times with a TaKaRa PCR<br>
Thermal Cycler 480 for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes<br>
at 50 °C, and 3 minutes at 72 °C and was then cycled.<br>
25 times for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes at 60 °C,<br>
and 3 minutes at 72 °C. Electrophoresis was performed<br>
in 1.5 % agarose gel using some of this PCR product.<br>
This product was then stained with ethidium bromide<br>
(Ninon Gene Co., ltd.) and observed under ultraviolet<br>
rays to confirm amplification of approximately 400 bp<br>
cDNA. After digestion treatment with restriction<br>
endonucleases BamHI and XhoI, electrophoresis was<br>
performed in 1.5 % agarose gel and staining with<br>
ethidium bromide was carried out. An approximately<br>
370 bp band was cut out from the gel. This band was<br>
purified with SuprecOl (Takara Co., Ltd.) and then<br>
inserted into pGEX-6P-l (Pharmacia), which is a<br>
commercial vector.<br>
This same vector can function as an expression<br>
vector for the desired molecule, which can express<br>
fused protein with GST protein, by insertion of the<br>
desired gene fragment into the appropriate<br>
restriction endonuclease site. Actually, vector<br>
pGEX-6P-l and the previous DNA were mixed together at<br>
a molar ratio of 1:5 and DNA was inserted into the<br>
vector with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen Co.). Vector<br>
pGEX-4T~-l into which ETNA had been inserted was<br>
genetically introduced to Escherichia  coli  One-Shot<br>
Competent Cells (Invitrogen Co., Ltd.) and then<br>
inoculated in a plate of L-Broth (Takara Co., Ltd.)<br>
semi-sold culture plate containing 50 mg/ml<br>
ampicillin (Sigma). The plate was then set aside at<br>
37°C for 12 hours and the colonies that grew were<br>
selected at random and inoculated into 2 ml L-Broth<br>
liquid culture medium containing the same<br>
concentration of ampicillin. Shake cultivation was<br>
performed at 37°C for 8 hours and the bacteria was<br>
recovered and the plasmid was separated using Wizard<br>
Miniprep (Promega Co.,) in accordance with the<br>
attached literature. The plasmid was cleaved with<br>
restriction endonuclease BamHI/XhoI. Insertion of<br>
said PCR product was confirmed by cutting out<br>
approximately 370 bp DNA. The base sequence of the<br>
DNA that had been inserted was determined using said<br>
clone.<br>
Determination of the base sequence of the<br>
inserted DNA fragment was performed using the<br>
Fluorescence Sequencer of Applied Biosystems. The<br>
sequence sample was prepared using PRISM, Ready<br>
Reaction Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied<br>
Biosystems). First, 9.5 ml reaction stock solution,<br>
4.0 ml T7 promoter primer at 0.8 pmol/ml (Gibco BRL)<br>
and 6.5 ml of template DNA for sequencing at 0.16<br>
mg/ml were added to a microtube with a capacity of<br>
0.5 ml, mixed and superposed with 100 ml mineral oil.<br>
PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles, where<br>
one cycle consisted of 30 seconds at 96 °C, 15<br>
seconds at 55 °C, and 4 minutes at 60 °C. The product<br>
was then kept at 4 °C for 5 minutes . After the<br>
reaction was completed, 80 ul sterilized pure water<br>
was added and stirred. The product was centrifuged<br>
and the aqueous layer was extracted 3 times with<br>
phenol-chloroform. Ten microliters 3 M sodium<br>
acetate (pH 5.2) and 300 ml ethanol were added to 100<br>
ml aqueous layer and stirred. The product was then<br>
centrifuged for 15 minutes at room temperature and<br>
14,000 rpm and the sediment was recovered. Once the<br>
sediment was washed with 75 % ethanol, it was dried<br>
under a vacuum for 2 minutes to obtain the sequencing<br>
sample. The sequencing sample was dissolved in<br>
formamide containing 4 ml 10 mM EDTA and denatured<br>
for 2 minutes at 90 °C. This was then cooled in ice<br>
and submitted to sequencing.<br>
One of the 7 clones obtained had homology of the<br>
sequence with the probe used for PCR. In addition,<br>
DNA sequences extremely similar to the gene sequence<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 gene of the other<br>
microorganisms, for example. Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,<br>
were discovered. The entire base sequence and the<br>
corre-sponding amino acid sequence of the structural<br>
gene moiety are as sJaown Ln Sequence ID No. 19 and<br>
No. 20 of the Sequence Table. This gene fragment<br>
clearly codes for Streptococcus pneumoniae  ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12.<br>
50 ml Escherichia  coli  into which expression<br>
vector had been inserted was cultivated overnight in<br>
a two-fold concentration YT medium at 37 °C. Then,<br>
450 ml of the two-fold concentration YT medium was<br>
heated at 37 °C for 1 hour. 50 ml of the Escherichia<br>
coli  solution that had been cultivated overnight was<br>
introduced to 450 ml of the aforementioned medium.<br>
After cultivation for one hour at 37 °C, 100 ml 500<br>
mM IPTG was introduced and cultivated for 4 hours at<br>
25 °C. The product was then recovered and introduced<br>
to centrifugation tube at each 250 ml and centrifuged<br>
for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was<br>
discarded and dissolved in 25 ml each 50 mM Tris-HCl<br>
at a pH of 7.4 and Lysis buffer containing 25 %<br>
sucrose.<br>
Furthermore, 1.25 ml 10 % NP-40 and 125 ml 1 M.<br>
MgCl2 were added and transferred to a plastic tube.<br>
Sonication was performed 1 minute x 5 times while ice<br>
cold. The product was centrifuged for 15 minutes at<br>
12,000 rpm and the supernatant was recovered.<br>
Next, the aforementioned supernatant was adsorbed<br>
on a glutathione sepharose column (manufactured by<br>
Pharmacia) condLLtioned with. PBS. Then, the column<br>
was washed with PBS three timers the tred volume.<br>
Elution was performed with ,50 mM Tris-HCl at a pH of<br>
8.0 containing 10 mM glutathione. The protein<br>
content in the fraction was determined by the pigment<br>
bonding method (Bradford method; BioRad Co.) and the<br>
main fraction was acquired. The main fraction was<br>
dialyzed three times against 3 L PBS.<br>
1 ml of a cleavage buffer containing 500 mM Tris-<br>
HC1 (pH 7.0), 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 10 mM DTT<br>
was added to 10 ml of 1 mg/ml solution of the<br>
resulting GST fusion ribosomal protein L7/L12. 100 |ll<br>
of 2 m/ml PreScission Protease (manufactured by<br>
Pharmacia company) was further added and reacted at 4<br>
°C to separate the GST moiety from ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12.<br>
The reaction solution was passed through a<br>
glutathione sepharose column which had been<br>
conditioned with PBS. The solution coming out from<br>
the column was recovered. One-bed volume of PBS was<br>
passed through and also recovered. Purity of the<br>
purified ribosomal protein L7/L12 that was obtained<br>
was confirmed by electrophoresis to be approximately<br>
90 %, showing that a purity satisfactory for an<br>
immunogen could be guaranteed.<br>
First, 100 ug protein antigen erf ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of Streptococcus pneumoniae was<br>
dissolved in 2 00 ul PBS and tfcen 200 jol Fxsmrd * s<br>
complete adjuvant was added and mixed axtd<br>
emulsification was performed. 200 ul was<br>
intraperitoneally injected to immunize mice. Then,<br>
the same emulsion antigen was intraperitoneally<br>
injected after 2 weeks, after 4 weeks, and after 6<br>
weeks. A two-fold concentration antigen emulsion was<br>
further injected intraperitoneally after 10 weeks and<br>
after 14 weeks. The spleen was excised 3 days after<br>
the final immunization and submitted to cell fusion.<br>
After thoroughly mixing 2 x 107 myeloma cells per<br>
108 spleen cells from mice,, which had been recovered<br>
aseptically, in a glass tube, the mixture was<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm and the<br>
supernatant was discarded. The cells were thoroughly<br>
mixed.<br>
The myeloma cells used for cell fusion were<br>
obtained by cultivation of cell strain NS-1 with an<br>
RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10 % FCS,<br>
cultivating this product beginning 2 weeks before<br>
cell fusion using an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.13<br>
mM azaguanine, 0.5 ug/ml MC-210, and 10 % FCS for 1<br>
weeks, and then further cultivating the cell strain<br>
for 1 week with an RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 %<br>
FCS. 30 ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium 50 ml that had<br>
been kept at 37 °C was added to the mixed cell sample<br>
and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm. After removal of the<br>
supernatant, 1 ml 50 % polyethylene glycol that haad<br>
been kept at 3 7 °C was added and stirred far 2<br>
minute. 10 ml RPMI 1640 medium kept at 37 °C was<br>
added and the solution was vigorously mixed for<br>
approximately 5 minutes as it was suctioned and<br>
evacuated using a sterile pipette.<br>
After centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1,000 rpm<br>
and removal of the supernatant, 30 ml HAT medium were<br>
added to bring the cell concentration to 5 x 106<br>
cells/ml. This mixture was stirred till uniform and<br>
then poured, 0,1ml at a time, into a 96-well culture<br>
plate and cultivated- at 37 °C under 7 % CO2. HAT<br>
medium was added, 0.1 ml at a time, on Day 1 and at<br>
Week 1 and Week 2.<br>
Then, the cells that had produced the desired<br>
antibody were screened by ELISA. Solutions of<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Streptococcus pneumoniae<br>
dissolved in PBS containing 0.05 % sodium azide<br>
diluted to 10 ug/ml were poured, 100 ml at a time,<br>
into separate 96-well plates and adsorbed overnight<br>
at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant, 200 ul 1 %<br>
bovine serum albumin solution (in PBS) were added and<br>
reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the product was<br>
washed with a washing solution (0.02 % Tween 20,<br>
PBS). 100 pi of a culture solution of fusion cells<br>
was added and reacted for two hours at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant was removed and tire<br>
product was further washed with a washing solution-.<br>
Then,' 100 ul of a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse<br>
antibody solution at 50 ng/ml was added and reacted<br>
for one hour at room temperature. The supernatant<br>
was removed and the product was washed with a washing<br>
solution. TMB (KPL) solution was added, 100 ml at a<br>
time, and reacted for 20 minutes at room temperature.<br>
After coloration, 100 ml 1 N sulfuric acid were added<br>
to stop the reaction. Absorbance at 450 nm was<br>
determined.<br>
As a result, positive wells that reacted with<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 were detected, confirming<br>
presence of the antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12.<br>
Therefore, the cells in the positive wells were<br>
recovered and cultivated with HAT medium in a 24-well<br>
plastic plate. The fused medium that had been<br>
cultivated was diluted with an HT medium to a cell<br>
count of approximately 20 cells/ml and then mixed<br>
with 106 six-week-old mouse thyroid cells suspended<br>
in the HT medium in a 96-well culture plate. The<br>
cells were cultivated for 2 weeks at 37 °C under the<br>
conditions of 7 % C02. The antibody activity in the<br>
culture supernatant was determined by the<br>
aforementioned ELISA method and the cells that showed<br>
a positive reaction with ribosomal protein L7/L12<br>
were recovered.<br>
Furthermore, the same dilution and cloning<br>
procedure was repeated to obtain a total of 4 clones<br>
of hybridoma AMSP-1 to 4.<br>
Example 6<br>
Reaction of monoclonal antibody that reacts wich<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Streptococcus pneumoniae,<br>
with Streptococcus pneumoniae  and other<br>
microorganisms<br>
A monoclonal antibody was produced and recovered<br>
in accordance with standard methods using the<br>
positive hybridoma cells obtained as previously<br>
described.<br>
Specifically, cells subcultured in RPMI 1640<br>
medium (containing 10 % FCS) was diluted with a<br>
serum-free medium to about 2 x 105 cells/ml, 3.3 x 105<br>
cells/ml, and 5 x 105 cells/ml in 25 cm2 culture<br>
flasks, and the total volume was made 5 ml. After<br>
cells were grown for 3 to 5 days in 7 % CO2 at 37 °C ,<br>
a flask which contains the least number of original<br>
cells was selected among flasks in which cells were<br>
grown. The same procedure was repeated until the<br>
cells diluted to 2 x 105 cells/ml grow to 2 x 106<br>
cells/ml in 3 to 4 days, thereby adapting the cells<br>
with the serum-free medium. Next, cloning was<br>
performed in a 96-well plate for bacteria cultivation<br>
to select cells exhibiting fastest growth and a<br>
highest antibody titer. The selected cells were<br>
grown in a 24-well plate and diluted with a serum-<br>
free medium in a 2 5 cm2 culture flask to a<br>
concentration of about 2 x 105 cells/ml and the total<br>
volume was made 10 ml. After incubation for 3 to 4<br>
days in 7 % C02 at 37 °C to a concentration of 1 x 106<br>
cells/ml, the culture broth 100 ml, 1 x 106 cells/ml<br>
was transferred to a bottle for mass cultivation<br>
which were grown in the same manner in a 75 cm<br>
flask. 100 ml of a serum-free medium was added to<br>
the mixture, which was incubated at 37 °C for two<br>
days while stirring. 200 ml of the serum-free medium<br>
was added again and the mixture was incubated for a<br>
further two days. The culture broth was divided into<br>
four aliquot, the serum-free medium was added to each<br>
portion, followed by incubation for two days. After<br>
further addition of 400 ml of the serum-free medium,<br>
the culture broth was incubated for 6 days. The<br>
culture broth was collected and centrifuged at 10,000<br>
rpm for 15 minutes to obtain a- culture supernatant<br>
that contain the target antibody. After the addition<br>
of sodium azide to final concentration 0.1 %, the<br>
culture supernatant was stored at 4 °C. 100 ml of the<br>
solution containing the antibody that was obtained<br>
was 5-fold diluted with PBS and adsorbed in a Protein<br>
G column (5 ml bed, Pharmacia) and washed with 3-bed<br>
volume of PBS. Then eluted with citrate buffer at a<br>
pH 3, the antibody fraction was recovered, and<br>
monocloaal antibody pxodxiced by each hybridoma was<br>
obtained. The monoclonal antibodies originating from<br>
the four hybridoma clones were evaluated according to<br>
the OIA method described in Publication of<br>
International Patent Application Japanese Laid-open<br>
(Toku-Hyou) No. 509565/1995.<br>
Specifically, the OIA method comprises preparing<br>
a reactive substrate by reacting an antibody for<br>
capture on a silicon wafer having a thin film layer<br>
of silicon nitride, causing this substrate to react<br>
with an antigen which is an extract of microorganisms<br>
for a prescribed period of time, causing the captured<br>
antigen to react with an antibody (an amplification<br>
reagent) which is an enzyme-labeled antibody, and<br>
finally adding a substrate solution to produce a<br>
thin-film precipitate. The antigen-antibody reaction<br>
can be judged visually by a degree of light<br>
interference color produced in the precipitate.<br>
The monoclonal antibody preparation was used and<br>
evaluated as a capture antibody to be immobilized on<br>
a silicon wafer having a silicon nitride thin film<br>
layer in the OIA method. Moreover, peroxidase-<br>
labeled AMGC-1 monoclonal antibody which can non-<br>
specifically react with ribosomal proteins L7/L12<br>
protein of a variety of microorganisms described in<br>
Reference Example was used as the detect antibody.<br>
That is, enzyme labeling was performed in accordance<br>
with the- method in "Artalyticsl Biochemistry" 132<br>
(19-83), 68-73 with the re-agent S—acetyIthioacetic<br>
acid N-hydroxysuccinimide for binding using<br>
horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Grade VI).<br>
In the OIA reaction, monoclonal antibody in a PBS<br>
containing 0.05 % sodium azide was diluted with 0.1 M<br>
HEPES (pH 8.0) to a concentration of 10 mg/ml and<br>
added onto a silicone wafer which has a thin film<br>
layer of silicon nitride, 50 ul at a time, to react<br>
for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by<br>
washing with distilled water and use.<br>
15 ml of antigen solution, which, had been<br>
obtained by adding 0.5% Triton X-100 to culture<br>
solutions of various species of microorganisms and<br>
then extracting the solution for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature, was added to the specimen obtained in<br>
the above-described procedure and reacted for 10<br>
minutes at room temperature. Then, 15 ml of 20 mg/ml<br>
peroxidase-labeled AMGC1 anti-body was added and<br>
reacted for 10 minuter. After washing with distilled<br>
wairer, a substrate solution (KPL) was added, 15 ul at<br>
a time, and reacted for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature. The product was washed with distilled<br>
water to judge the concentration of detection signals<br>
as an intensity of light interference by naked eyes.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 2 it is clear that<br>
when monoclonal antibody derived from hybridoma AMSP-<br>
2 was used as the capture antibody, all strains of<br>
Str^pxocaccus pneunion.Lae tested were detected at a<br>
sensitivity of 106 bacteria/ml, while reactivity of<br>
other bacteria could not be detected at a higher<br>
concentration of 108 bacteria/ml. Thus, the antibody<br>
with specific reactivity to Streptococcus pneumoniae<br>
was confirmed to have been obtained by using the<br>
monoclonal antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12.<br>
The hybridoma AMSP-2 which produces the<br>
monoclonal antibody specific to Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae  has been deposited with National Institute<br>
of Bioscience and Human-Technology, the Agency of<br>
Industrial Science and Technology, the Ministry of<br>
International Trade and Industry, Japan, on July 28,<br>
1999, with the disposition number FERM BP-6807.<br>

Cloning of ribosomal protein L7/L12 genes from<br>
Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  mass expression in Escherichia<br>
coli and purification of the same protein and<br>
preparation of monoclonal antibody to the same<br>
protein<br>
After inoculating an appropriate amount of<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  strain IID821 (obtained from<br>
Tokyo University School of Medicine Laboratories) in<br>
a chocolate agar culture medium, the strain was<br>
cultivated for 24 hours in a CO2 incubator under<br><br>
conditions of 37 °C and 5.0% CO2. The colonies<br>
that grew were suspended in a TE buffer to a final<br>
concentration of approximately 5 x 109 CFU/ml.<br>
Approximately 1.5 ml of this suspension was<br>
transferred to a microcentrifugation tube and<br>
centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The<br>
supernatant was discarded. The sediment was<br>
resuspended in 567 ul TE buffer. Then 30 Hi 10 % SDS<br>
and 3 ml 20 mg/ml Proteinase K solution were added<br>
and thoroughly mixed. The suspension was incubated<br>
for another hour at 37oC.<br>
Next, after adding 80 ml 10 % cetyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium bromide/0.7 M NaCl solution and thoroughly<br>
mixing the product, it was incubated for 10 minutes<br>
at 65 °C. Next, 700 ml chloroform-isoamyl alcohol<br>
solution at a volume ratio of 24:1 was added and<br>
stirred well. The solution was centrifuged for 5<br>
minutes (while being kept at 4 °C) at 12,000 rpm<br>
using a microcentrifugation device and the aqueous<br>
fraction was transferred to a new microtube.<br>
Isopropanol was added to the fraction at 0.6-times<br>
its volume and the tube was vigorously shaken to form<br>
sediment of the DNA. The white DNA sediment was<br>
scooped with a glass rod and transferred to a<br>
different microcentrifugation tube containing 1 ml 70<br>
% ethanol (cooled to -20 °C) .<br>
Next, the product was centrifuged for 5 minutes<br>
at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was gently removed.<br>
Then another 1 ml 70 % ethanol was added and the<br>
product was centrifuged- for 5 more minutes.<br>
Once the supernatant had been removed, the<br>
sediment was dissolved in 100 ml TE buffer to obtain<br>
the DNA solution. The concentration of the genomic<br>
DNA solution was determined quantitatively in<br>
accordance with E5, Spectrophotometry determination<br>

sequence of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  acquired from<br>
Internet Information (Oklahoma University, N.<br>
Gonorrhoeae  Genome Project, disclosed genomic DNA<br>
data) because of the similarity with ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 DNA sequence of other bacteria, were<br>
added to the enzyme to bring the final volume to 50<br>
ml.<br>
This mixture was cycled 5 times with a TaKaRa PCR<br>
Thermal Cycler 480 for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes<br>
at 50 °C, and 3 minutes at 72 °C and was then cycled<br>
25 times for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes at 60 °C,<br>
and 3 minutes at 72 °C. Electrophoresis was performed<br>
in 1.5 % agarose gel using some of this PCR product.<br>
This product was then stained with ethidium bromide<br>
(Nihon Gene Co., ltd.) and observed under ultraviolet<br>
rays Ud confirm amplification of approximately 400 bp<br>
cDNA. After digestion treatment with restriction<br>
endonucleases BamHI and Xhol, electrophoresis was<br>
performed in 1.5 % agarose gel and staining with<br>
ethidium bromide was carried out. An approximately<br>
370 bp band was cut out from the gel. This band was<br>
purified with SuprecOl (Takara Co., Ltd.) and then<br>
inserted into pGEX-4T-l (Pharmacia), which is a<br>
commercial vector. Actually, vector pGEX-4T-l and the<br>
previous DNA were mixed together at a molar ratio of<br>
1:3 and DNA was inserted into the vector with T4 DNA<br>
ligase (Invitrogen Co.). Vector pGEX-4T-l into which<br>
DNA had been inserted was genetically introduced to<br>
Escherichia  coli  One-Shot Competent Cells (Invitrogen<br>
Co., Ltd.) and then inoculated in a plate of L-Broth<br>
(Takara Co., Ltd.) semi-sold culture plate containing<br>
50 mg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). The plate was then set<br>
aside at 37 °C for 12 hours and the colonies that<br>
grew were selected at random and inoculated into 2ml<br>
L-Broth liquid culture medium containing the same<br>
concentration of ampicillin. Shake cultivation was<br>
performed at 37°C for 8 hours and the bacteria was<br>
recovered and the plasmid was separated using Wizard<br>
Miniprep in accordance with the attached literature.<br>
The plasmid was cleaved with restriction endonuclease<br>
BamHI/XhoI. Insertion of said PCR product was<br>
confirmed by cutting out approximately 370 bp DNA.<br>
The base sequence of the DNA that had been inserted<br>
was determined using said clone.<br>
Determination of the base sequence of the<br>
inserted DNA fragment was performed using the<br>
Fluorescence Sequencer of Applied Biosystems. The<br>
sequence sample was prepared using PRISM, Ready<br>
Reaction Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied<br>
Biosystems). First, 9.5 ml reaction stock solution,<br>
4.0 ml T7 promoter primer at 0.8 pmol/ml (Gibco BRL)<br>
and 6.5 ml template DNA for sequencing at 0.16 mg/ml<br>
were added to a microtube with a capacity of 0.5 ml<br>
and mixed. After layering with 100 ml mineral oil,<br>
PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles, where<br>
one cycle consisted of 30 seconds at 96 °C, 15<br>
seconds at 55 °C, and 4 minutes at 60 °C. The product<br>
was then kept at 4 °C for 5 minutes. After the<br>
reaction was completed, 80 ml sterilized pure water<br>
was added and stirred. The product was centrifuged<br>
and the aqueous layer was extracted 3 times with<br>
phenol-chloroform. Ten microliters 3 M sodium<br>
acetate (pH 5.2) and 300 ml ethanol were added to 100<br>
ml aqueous layer and stirred. The product was then<br>
centrifuged for 15 minutes at room temperature and<br>
14000 rpm and the sediment was recovered. Once the<br>
sediment was washed with 75 % ethanol, it was dried<br>
under a vacuum for 2 minutes to obtain the sequencing<br>
sajnple. The sequencing sample was dissolved in<br>
formamide containing 4 pi 10 mM EDTA and denatured<br>
for 2 minutes at 90 °C. This was then cooled in ice<br>
and submitted to sequencing. One of the 5 clones<br>
obtained had homology of the sequence with the probe<br>
used for PCR. In addition, DNA sequences extremely<br>
similar to the gene sequence of ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 gene of the other microorganisms, for example,<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae, were discovered. The entire<br>
base sequence and the corresponding amino acid<br>
sequence of the structural gene moiety are as shown<br>
in Sequence No. 21 and No. 22 of the Sequence Table.<br>
This gene fragment clearly codes for ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 gene of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae.<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  fusion GST ribosome protein<br>
L7/L12 prepared by the same method as in Example 2<br>
was obtained using the Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  fusion<br>
GST ribosomal protein L7/L12 expression vector<br>
constructed in this way.<br>
Furthermore, hybridoma strain GCRB-3, which<br>
produces monoclonal antibody to ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae, was obtained in<br>
accordance with the method in Example 3.<br>
Example 8<br>
Reaction of monoclonal antibody that reacts with<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 of. Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,<br>
with Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  and other microorganisms<br>
Monoclonal antibody was produced and recovered in<br>
accordance with standard me^ttrods using the positive<br>
hybridoma cells GCRB-3 obtained as previously<br>
described.<br>
Basically, 5 x 106 cells (in PBS) that had been<br>
subcultured using RPMI 1640 culture medium<br>
(containing 10 % FCS) were intraperitoneally injected<br>
into Balb/C mice that had been intraperitoneally<br>
injected with 0.5 ml Pristane 2 weeks earlier.<br>
Ascites was recovered 3 weeks later and the<br>
centrifugation supernatant was obtained.<br>
The solution containing antibody that was<br>
obtained was adsorbed in a Protein A column (5 ml<br>
bed, Pharmacia) and washed with 3-bed volume of PBS.<br>
Then eluted with citrate buffer at pH 3, the antibody<br>
fraction was recovered and the monoclonal antibody<br>
that was produced by each hybridoma was obtained.<br>
The monoclonal antibody derived from the GCRB-3<br>
hybridoma was used in ELISA.<br>
The sandwich assay method was used to assess the<br>
monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody that<br>
was prepared was used as an enzyme-labeled antibody<br>
by being chemically bound to peroxidase. That is,<br>
enzyme labeling was performed in accordance with the<br>
method in "Analytical Biochemistry" 132 (1983), 68-73<br>
with the reagent S-acetylthioacetic acid N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide for binding using horseradish<br>
peroxidase (Sigma Grade VI). By means of the ELISA<br>
reaction, a solution of commercial antri Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae  polyclonal antibody in PBS containing<br>
0.05% sodium azide(Virostat, rabbit) was diluted to a<br>
concentration of 10 mg/ml and poured, 100 ml  at a<br>
time, into a separate 96-well plate and adsorbed<br>
overnight at 4 °C.<br>
After removal of the supernatant, 200 ml 1 %<br>
bovine serum albumin solution (in PBS) were added and<br>
reacted for 1 hour and blocked at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the product was<br>
washed with washing solution (0.02 % Tween 20, PBS).<br>
One-hundred microliters of antigen solution, which<br>
had been obtained by adding Triton X-100 to culture<br>
solutions of each species of microorganisms to a<br>
concentration of 0.3 % and then extracting the<br>
solution for 5 minutes at room temperature, were<br>
added to this and reacted for 2 hours at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant was removed and the<br>
product was further washed with washing solution.<br>
Then 100 ul peroxidase-labeled anti-ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 antibody solution at 5 ug/ml were added and<br>
reacted for 1 hour at room temperature. The<br>
supernatant was removed and the product was washed<br>
with washing solution. TMB (KPL) solution was added,<br>
100 ul at a time, and reacted for 20 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After coloration, 100 ul 1 N sulfuric<br>
acid were added to stop the reaction. Absorbance at<br>
450 nm was determined.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 3 it is clear that<br>
when monoclonal antibody derived from hybridoma GCRB-<br>
3 was used as the enzyme-labeled antibody, all<br>
strains of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  tested were detected<br>
at a sensitivity of 106 cells/ml, while reactivity of<br>
other species belonging to the genus Neisseria  and<br>
other microorganisms could not be detected, even at<br>
high concentrations of 108 cells/ml and therefore,<br>
antibody with specific reactivity tc Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae can be obtained by using monoclonal<br>
5 antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12.<br>

After inoculating an appropriate amount of<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  strain IID821 (obtained from<br>
Tokyo University School of Medicine Laboratories) in<br>
a chocolate agar culture medium, the strain was<br>
cultivated for 24 hours in a CO2  incubator under<br>
conditions of 37 °C and 50% CO2. The colonies<br>
that grew were suspended in a TE buffer to a final<br>
concentration of approximately 5 x 109 CFU/ml.<br>
Approximately 1.5 ml of this suspension was<br>
transferred to a microcentrifugation tube and<br>
centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The<br>
supernatant was discarded. The sediment was<br>
resuspended in 567 pi TE buffer. Then 30 pi 10 % SDS<br>
and 3 pi 20 mg/ml Proteinase K solution were added<br>
and thoroughly mixed. The suspension was incubated<br>
for another hour at 37 °C. Next, after adding 80 pi<br>
10 % cetyl trimexhyl ammonium bromide/0.7 M NaCl<br>
solution and thoroughly mixing the product, it was<br>
incubated for 10 minutes at 65 °C. Next, 700 pi<br>
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution at a volume ratio<br>
of 24:1 was raddled and stirred well.<br>
The solution was centrifuged for 5 minutes (while<br>
being kept at 4 °C) at 12,000 rpm using a<br>
microcentrifugation device and the aqueous fraction<br>
was transferred to a new microtube. Isopropanol was<br>
added to the fraction at 0.6-times its volume and the<br>
tube was vigorously shaken to form sediment of  the<br>
DNA. The white DNA sediment was scooped with a glass<br>
rod and transferred to a different<br>
microcentrifugation tube containing 1 ml 70 % ethanol<br>
(cooled to -20 °C) .<br>
Next, the product was centrifuged for 5 minutes<br>
at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was gently removed.<br>
Then another 1 ml 70 % ethanol was added and the<br>
product was centrifuged for 5 more minutes. Once the<br>
supernatant had been removed, the sediment was<br>
dissolved in 100 ml TE buffer to obtain the DNA<br>
solution. The concentration of the genomic DNA<br>
solution was determined quantitatively in accordance<br>
with E5, Spectrophotometry determination of the<br>
amount of DNA or RNA, "Molecular cloning: A<br>
laboratory manual," 1989, Eds. Sambrook, J., Fritsch,<br>

endonucleases BamHT and Xhcl, electrophoresis was<br>
performed in 1.5 % agarose ^e-L and staining with<br>
ethidium bromide was carried out. An approximately<br>
370 bp band was cut out from the gel. This band was<br>
purified with SuprecOl (Takara Co., Ltd.) and then<br>
inserted into pGEX-6P-l (Pharmacia) , which is a<br>
commercial vector. This same vector can function as<br>
an expression vector for the desired molecule, which<br>
can express fused protein with GST protein, by<br>
insertion of the desired gene fragment into the<br>
appropriate restriction endonuclease site. Actually,<br>
vector pGEX-€P-l and the previous DNA were mixed<br>
together at a molar ratio of 1:5 and DNA was inserted<br>
into the vector with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen Co.).<br>

cooled in ice and submitted to sequencing<br>
One of the 4 clones obtained had homology of the<br>
sequence with the probe used for PCR. In addition,<br>
DNA sequences extremely similar to the gene sequence<br>
of ribosomal protein L7/L12 gene of the other<br>
microorganisms, for example, Haemophilus influenzae ,<br>
were discovered. The entire base sequence and the<br>

50 ml Escherichia  coli  into which expression<br>
vector had been inserted was cultivated overnight in<br>
a two-fold concentration YT medium at 37 °C. Then,<br>
450ml of the two-fold concentration YT medium was<br>
heated at 37 °C for 1 hour. 50 ml of the Escherichia<br>
coli  solution that had been cultivated overnight was<br>
introduced to 450ml of the aforementioned medium.<br>
After cultivation for one hour at 37 °C, 100 ul 500<br>
mM IPTG was introduced and cultivated for 4 hours at<br>
25 °C. The product was then recovered and introduced<br>
2 50 ml each to a centrifugation tube and centrifuged<br>
tor 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was<br>
discarded and dissolved in 25 ml each 50 mM Tris-HCl<br>
at a pH of 7.4 and- Lysis buffer containing 25 %<br>
sucrose.<br>
Furthermore, 1.25 ml 10% NP-40 and 123 ml 1 M<br>
MgCla were added and transferred to a plastic tube.<br>
Sonication was performed 1 minute x 5 times while ice<br>
cold. The product was centrifuged for 1.5 minutes at<br>
12,000 rpm and the supernatant was recovered.<br>
Next, the aforementioned supernatant was adsorbed<br>
on a glutathione sepharose column {manufactured by<br>
Pharmacia) conditioned with PBS. Then, the column was<br>
washed with PBS three times the bed volume. Elution<br>
was performed with 50 mM Tris-HCl at a pH of 8.0<br>
containing 10 mM glutathione. The protein content in<br>
the fraction was determined by the pigment bonding<br>
method (Bradford method; BioRad Co.) and the main<br>
fraction was acquired. The main fraction was<br>
dialyzed three times against 3L PBS.<br>
1 ml of a cleavage buffer containing 500 mM Tris-<br>
HCl (pH 7.0), 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 10 mM DTT<br>
was added to 10 ml of 1 mg/ml solution of the.<br>
resulting GST fusion ribosomal protein L7/L12. 100<br>
ml of 2 u/ml PreScission Protease (manufactured by<br>
Pharmacia company) was further added and reacted at 4<br>
°C to separate the GST moiety from ribosomal protein<br>
L7/LI2.<br>
The reaction solution was passed through a<br>
glutathione sepharose column which had been<br>
conditioned with PBS. The solution coming out from<br>
the column was recovered. One bed volume of PBS was<br>
passed through and also recovered. Purity of the<br>
purified ribosomal protein L7/L12 that was obtained<br>
was confirmed by electrophoresis to be approximately<br>
90 %, showing that a purity satisfactory for an<br>
immunogen could be guaranteed.<br>
First, 100 mg  protein antigen of ribasomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  was dissolved<br>
in 200 ml PBS and then 200 ul Freund's complete<br>
adjuvant was added and mixed and emulsification was<br>
performed. 200 ml was intraperitoneally injected to<br>
immunize mice. Then, the same emulsion antigen was<br>
intraperitoneally injected after 2 weeks, after 4<br>
weeks, and after 6 weeks. A two-fold concentration <br>
antigen emulsion was further injected<br>
intraperitoneally after 10 weeks and after 14 weeks.<br>
The spleen was excised 3 days after the final<br>
immunization and submitted to cell fusion.<br>
After thoroughly mixing 2 x 107 myeloma cells per<br>
108 spleen cells from mice, which had been recovered<br>
aseptically, in a glass tube, the mixture was<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm and the<br>
supernatant was discarded. The cells were thoroughly<br>
mixed.<br>
The myeloma cells used for cell fus-ion were<br>
obtained by cultivation of cell strain NS-1 with an<br>
RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10 %"FCS,<br>

weeks, and then further cultivating the cell strain<br>
for 1 week with an RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 %<br>
FCS. 30 ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium 50 ml that had<br>
been kept at 37°C was added to the mixed cell sample<br>
and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm. After removal of the<br>
supernatant, 1 ml 50 % polyethylene glycol that had<br>
been kept at 37 °C was added and stirred for 2 minute.<br>
10 ml RPMI 1640 medium kept at 37 °C was added and<br>
the -solution was vigorously mixed for approximately 5<br>
minutes as it was suctioned and evacuated from a<br>
sterile pipette.<br>
After centrifugation for. 5 minutes at 1,000 rpm<br>
and removal of the supernatant, 30 ml HAT culture<br>
medium were added to bring the cell concentration to<br>
5 x 106 cells/ml. This mixture was stirred till<br>
uniform and then poured, 0.1 ml at a time, into a 96-<br>
well culture plate and cultivated at 37 °C under 7 %<br>
C02. HAT medium was added,. 0.1 ml at a time, on Day 1<br>
and at Week 1 and Week 2.<br>
Then the cells that had produced the desired<br>

reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the product was<br>
washed with a washing solution (0.02 % Tween 20, PBS).<br>
100 ul cf a culture solution of fus^ron cells was<br>
added and reacted for two hours ^at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the product was<br>
further washed with a washing solution. Then, 100 ul<br>
of a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody<br>
solution at 50 ng/ml was added and reacted for one<br>
hour at room temperature. The supernatant was<br>
removed and the product was washed with a washing<br>
solution. TMB (KPL) solution was added, 100 ul at a<br>
time, and reacted for 20 minutes at room temperature.<br>
After coloration, 100 pi 1 N sulfuric acid were added<br>
to stop the reaction. Absorbance at 450 nm was<br>
determined.<br>
As a result, positive wells that reacted with<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 were detected, confirming<br>
presence of the antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12.<br>
Therefore, the cells in the positive wells were<br>
recovered and cultivated with HAT medium in a 24-well<br>
pla-&amp;td;c plate. The fused -medium that had been<br>
cultivated was diluted with an HT medium to a cell<br>
count of approximately 20 cells/ml. Then 50 ul the<br>
medium was mixed with 106 six-week-old mouse thyroid<br>
©ells suspended in the HT medium in a 9 6-well culture<br>
plate. The cells were cultivated for 2 weeks at 37 °C<br>
under the conditions of 7 % C02. The antibody titer in<br>
the culture supernatant was determined by the<br>
aforementioned ELISA method and, the cells those<br>
showed a positive reactian with ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 were recovered. Furthermore, the same dilution<br>
and cloning procedure was repeated to obtain a total<br>
of 4 clones of hybridoma AMGC-5 to AMGC-8.<br>
Monoclonal antibody was produced and recovered<br>
according to standard methods, using the positive<br>
hybridoma cells obtained as previously described.<br>
Specifically, cells subcultured in RPMI 1640<br>
medium (containing 10 % FCS) was diluted in serum-<br>

and the total was made 5 ml. After cells were grown<br>
for 3 to 5 days in 7 % C02 at 37 °C, flask that<br>
contains the least number of original cells was<br>
selected among flasks in which cells were grown. The<br>
same procedure was repeated until the cells diluted<br>

medium was added to the mixture and was incubated at<br>
37 °C for two days while stirring. 200 ml of the<br>
serum-free medium was added again and the mixture was<br>
incubated for a further two days. The culture broth<br>
was divided into four aliquots, one volume serum-free<br>
medium was added to each portion, followed by<br>
incubation for two days. After further addition of<br>
400 ml of the serum-free medium, the culture broth<br>
was incubated for 6 days. The culture broth was<br>
collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15<br>
minutes to obtain culture supernatant containing the<br>
target antibody. After adding sodium azide to final<br>
concentration 0.1 %, the culture supernatant was<br>
stored at 4 °C. 100 ml of the supernatant containing<br>
the antibody was dri luted 5--xjaict with PBS and adsorbed<br>
in a protein G colasm- {5 ml toed, Pharmacia) and<br>
washed with 3-bed volume of PBS. Then eluted with<br>
citrate buffer at pH 3, the antibody fraction was<br>
recovered and monoclonal antibody produced by each<br>
hybridoma was obtained.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies originating from the<br>
four hybridoma clones were evaluated according to the<br>
OIA method described in International Patent<br>
Application Japanese Laid-open No. 509565/1995.<br>
Specifically, the CIA method comprises preparing<br>
a reactive substrate by reacting an antibody for<br>
capture on a silicon wafer having a thin film layer<br>
of silicon nitride, causing this substrate to react<br>
with an antigen which is an extract of microorganisms<br>
for a prescribed period of time, causing the captured<br>
antigen to react with an antibody (an amplification<br>
reagent) which is an enzyme-labeled antibody, and<br>
finally adding a substrate solution to produce a<br>
thin-film precipitate. The antigen-antibody reaction<br>
can be judged visually by a degree of light,<br>
interference color produced in the precipitate.<br>
The monoclonal antibody preparation was used as a<br>
capture antibody to be immobilized on a silicon wafer<br>
having a silicon nitride thin film layer in the OIA<br>
method. Moreover, peroxidase-labeled AMGC-i<br>
monoclonal antibody which can ntm-specifically react<br>
with ribosomal proteins L7/L.12 protein of a variety<br>
of" microorganisms described in 8efer«ace Eac-ample was<br>
used as the detect antibody. That is, enzyme<br>
labeling was performed in accordance with the method<br>
in "Analytical Biochemistry" 132 (1983), 68-73 with<br>
trhe reagent S-acetylthioacetic acid N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide for binding using horseradish<br>
peroxidase (Sigma Grade VI).<br>
In the OIA reaction, monoclonal antibody in a PBS<br>
containing 0.05 % sodium azide was diluted with 0.1 M<br>
HEPES (pH.8.0) to a concentration of 10 jig/ml and<br>
added onto a silicone wafer which has a thin film<br>
layer of silicon nitride, 50 ml at a time, to react<br>
for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by<br>
washing with distilled water and use. 15 ml of<br>
antigen solution, which had been obtained by adding<br>
0.5 % Triton X-100 to culture suspension of various<br>
species of microorganisms and then extracting the<br>
suspension for 5 minutes at room temperature, was<br>
added to the specimen obtained in the above-described<br>
procedure and reacted for 10 minutes at room<br>
temperature. Then, 15 ml  of 20 mg/ml peroxidase-<br>
labeled AMGC1 was added and reacted for 10 minutes.<br>
After washing with distilled water, a substrate<br>
solution (KPL Co.) was added, 15 ml at a time, and<br>
reacted for 5 minutes at room temperature. The<br>
product was washed with distilled water to judge the<br>
concentration of detection signals as an intensity of<br>
light interference by naked eyes.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 4 it is clear that<br>
when monoclonal antibody derived from hybridoma AMGC-<br>
8 was used as the capture antibody, all strains of<br>
Neisseria genus tested were detected at  a sensitivity<br>
of 108 cells/ml, while reactivity of other<br>
microorganisms could not be detected. Thus, the<br>
antibody with specific reactivity to Neisseria  genus<br>
was confirmed to have been obtained by using the<br>
monoclonal antibody to ribosomal protein L7/L12 .<br>

Acquisition of a polyclonal antibody which<br>
specifically reacts with ribosomal protein L7/L12 of<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae using a ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 protein-immobilized affinity column<br>
  A centrifuqal supernatant of Haemophilus<br>
influenzae cell extract, which had been treated with<br>
0.5% Triton X-100 was used as an antigen. About 1.2<br>
ml of a physiological saline solution containing 100<br>
mg of antigen was emulsified with the addition of 1.5<br>
ml of Freund's adjuvant. The emulsion was<br>
subcutameously injected into four SPF Japanese White<br>
Rabbits to immunize the animals. The rabbits were<br>
immunized 5 to 6 times, once every two weeks, and the<br>
antibody titer was confirmed.<br>
The antibody titer was confirmed by the ELISA<br>
method. Solutions of ribosomal protein L7/L12 of<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae  dissolved in PBS containing<br>
0.05 % sodium azide diluted to 10 ug/ml were poured,<br>
100 ul at a time, into 96-well plates and adsorbed<br>
overnight at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant,<br>
200 pi 1 % bovine serum albumin solution (in PBS)<br>
were added and reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant was removed and the<br>
product was washed with a washing solution (0.02 %<br>
Tween 20, PBS). 100 ul of a solution obtained by<br>
diluting normal rabbit serum and immunized rabbit<br>
antiserum was added and reacted for two hours at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant was removed and the<br>
product was further washed with a washing solution.<br>
Then, 100 ul of a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit<br>
IgG antibody solution at 50 ng/ml was added and<br>
reacted for one hour at room temperature. The<br>
supernatant was removed and the product was washed<br>
with a washing solution. OPD solution (Sigma Co.)<br>
was added, 100 ul at a time, and reacted for 20<br>
minutes at room temperature. After coloration, 100<br>
ml of 1 N sulfuric acid was added to stop the<br>
reaction. Absoriance at 492 nm was determined.<br>
After confirming that the antibody titer had<br>
increased, a large quantity of blood was collected.<br>
Blood was collected in a centrifugal tube made of<br>
glass from the ear artery, allowed to stand for one<br>
hour at 37 °C, then overnight at 4 °C. The mixture<br>
was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes and the<br>
supernatant was recovered. The resulting 4 lots of<br>
anti-serum were stored at 4 °C.<br>
Next, an affinity column with immobilized<br>
ribcLSoraal protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus  influenzae<br>
and Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  was prepared. HiTrap NHS-<br>
activated column (1 ml, manufactured by Pharmacia)<br>
was used. Immediately after replacing the column<br>
with 6 ml of 1 mM HC1, 1 ml of a PBS solution of<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 adjusted to 1 mg/ml was<br>
charged. The column was allowed to stand for 15<br>
minutes -at 25 °C. This procedure was repeated 5<br>
times, thereby feeding the total 5 ml of the PBS<br>
solution of ribosomal protein L7/L12. Then, 6 ml of<br>
Buffer A (0.5 M ethanolamine, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3), 6<br>
ml of Buffer B (0.1 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 4),<br>
and 6 xrl of Buffer A were charged as blocking<br>
reagents. After allowing to stand for 15 minutes at<br>
25 °C, 6 ml of Buffer B, 6 ml of Buffer A, and 6 ml<br>
of Buffer B were further added. The mixture was then<br>
equilibrated with 6 ml of PBS.<br>
Using tiis. affinity column with immobilized<br>
riirosomal protein L7/L12 of Baaemophilus  influenzae,<br>
the polyclonal antibody in the resulting anti-serum<br>
was purified using the supernatant of Triton X-100<br>
treated bacteria of Haemophilus  influenzae  as an<br>
antigen. This antiserum was first diluted with PBS to<br>
a volume of 5 times, passed through a 0.45 urn filter,<br>
then caused to be adsorbed in the column immobilized<br>
with ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Haemophilus<br>
Influenzae at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After<br>
elntion from the column- with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.1)<br>
and immediately neutralizing with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH<br>
9.0), eluted fractions of the target antibody were<br>
recovered by the ELISA method, the same as anti-titer<br>
measuring method. These fractions were passed<br>
through the affinity column immobilized with the<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,<br>
which was equilibrated with PBS whereby the antibody<br>
that reacts with the ribosomal protein L7/L12 of<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae was adsorbed and fraction which<br>
passed through without adsorption was recovered.<br>
The polyclonal antibody purified in this manner<br>
«as evaluated -by the same OIA method as in Example 6.<br>
The purified antibody was used as a capture<br>
antibody for the OIA method. Moreover, peroxidase-<br>
labeled AMGC-1 monoclonal antibody described in<br>
Reference Example was used as the detect antibody.<br>
That is, enzyme labeling was performed in accordance<br>
with the method in "Analytical Biochemistry" 132<br>
(1983), 68-73 with the reagent S-acetylthioacetic<br>
acid N-hydroxysuccinimide for binding using<br>
horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Grade VI) .<br>
In the OIA reaction, the purified polyclonal<br>
antibody in a PBS containing 0.05 % sodium azide was<br>
diluted with 0.1 M HEPES (pH 8.0) to a concentration<br>
of 10 ml/ml and added onto a silicone wafer, 50 ml at<br>
a time, to react for 30 minutes at room temperature,<br>
followed by washing with distilled water and use.<br>
15 ml  of antigen solution, which had been<br>
obtained by adding 0.5 % Triton X-100 to culture<br>
suspension of various species of microorganisms and<br>
then extracting the suspension for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature, was added to the specimen obtained in<br>
•the above-described- procedure and reacted for 10<br>
minutes at room temperature. Then, 15 ml of 20 mg/ml<br>
peroxidase—laiyeled AMGC1 was added and reacted for 10<br>
minutes. After washing with distilled water, a<br>
substrate solution (KPL) was added, 15 ml at a time,<br>
and reacted for 5 minutes at room temperature. The<br>
product was washed with distilled water to observe<br>
the blue color concentration by the naked eyes.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 5 it is clear that<br>
when the purified polyclonal antibody of APHI2-2 was<br>
used as the capture antibody, Haemophilus  influenzae<br>
tested at a sensitivity of 10% bacteria/ml was<br>
detected, while reactivity ctf other microorganisms<br>
could not be detected. Thus, the antibody with<br>
specific reactivity to Haemophilus  influenzae  was<br>
confirmed to have been obtained by using the<br>
polyclonal antibody purified by an affinity column<br>
immobilized with the ribosomal protein L7/L12 of<br>
Haemophilus  influenzae.<br>

So called sandwich assay in which an antigen is<br>
sandwiched between a capture antibody and a labeled<br>
antibody for detection is useful to detect<br>
microorganisms by optical immunoassay and the ELISA<br>
method because of its high detection sensitivity. In<br>
this instance, not only an antibody which<br>
specifically reacts with antigens originating from<br>
the subject microorganism, but also another antibody<br>
which recognizes an antigen epitope different from<br>
that of the specific antibody are required.<br>
Antibodies which react non-specifically with<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 originating various<br>
microorganisms are very useful as an antibody which<br>
can constitute a sandwich assay with an antibody<br>
which reacts specifically with ribosomal protein<br>

Cloning of ribosomal protein L7/L12 genes from<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,  mass expression in Escherichia<br>

incubated for 10 minutes at 65 °C. Next, 700 ml<br>
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution at a volume ratio<br>
of 24:1 was added and stirred well. The solution was<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes (while being kept at 4 °C)<br>
at 12,000 rpm using a microcentrifugation device and<br>
the aqueous fraction was transferred to a new<br>
microtube. Isopropanol was added to the fraction at<br>
0 .6-times its volume and the tube was vioporously<br>
shaken to form sediment of the DNA. The white DNA<br>
sediment was scooped with a glass rod and transferred<br>
to a different microcentrifugation tube containing 1<br>

Next, the product was centrifuged fox 5 ttrinutes<br>
at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was gently removed.<br>
Then another 1 ml 70 % ethanol was added and the<br>
product was centrifuged for 5 more minutes. Once the<br>
supernatant had been removed, the sediment was<br>
dissolved in 100 ul TE buffer to obtain the DNA<br>

PCR was performed using 10 ng of this genomic<br>
DNA. Taq polymerase (Takara Co., Ltd., code R001A)<br>
was employed for PCR. Then, 5 ml of a buffer<br>
attached to enzyme, 4 ml of dNTP mixture attached to<br>
enzyme, and 2 00 pmol of each of synthetic<br>
oligonucleotide E shown in Sequence No. 15 of the<br>

in Sequence No. 16 of the Sequence Table, which were<br>
designed based on the ribosomal protein L7/L12 DNA<br>
sequence of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  acquired from<br>

protein L7/L12 DNA sequence of other bacteria, were<br>
added to the enzyme to bring the final volume to 50<br>

This mixture was cycled 5 times with a TaKaRa PCR<br>
Thermal Cycler 480 for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes<br>
at 50 °C, and 3 minutes at 72 °C and was then cycled<br>
25 times for 1 minute at 95 °C, 2 minutes at 60 °C,<br>
and 3 minutes at 72 °C. Electrophoresis was performed<br>
in 1.5 % agarose gel using some of this PCR product.<br>
This product was then stained with ethidium bromide<br>
(Nihon Gene Co., ltd.) and observed under ultraviolet<br>
rays to confirm amplification of approximately 400 bp<br>
cDNA. After digestion treatment with restriction<br>
endonucleases BamHI and Xhol, electrophoresis was<br>
performed in 1.5 % agarose gel and staining with<br>
ethidium bromide was carried out. An approximately<br>
370 bp band was cut out from the gel. This band was<br>
purified with SuprecOl (Takara Co., Ltd.) and then<br>
inserted into pGEX-4T-l (Eharmacia) , which is a<br>
commercial vector. Actually, vector pGEX-4T-l and<br>
the previous DNA were mixed together at a molar ratio<br>
of 1:3 and DNA was inserted into the vector with T4<br>
DNA ligase (Invitrogen Co.). Vector pGEX-4T-l into<br>
which DNA had been inserted was genetically<br>
introduced to Escherichia  coli  One-Shot Competent<br>
Cells (Invitrogen Co., Ltd.) and then inoculated in a<br>
plate of L-Broth (Takara Co., Ltd.) semi-sold culture<br>
plate containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). The<br>
plate was then set aside at 37 °C for 12 hours and<br>
the colonies that grew were selected at random and<br>
inoculated into 2 ml L-Broth liquid culture medium<br>
containing the same concentration of ampicillin.<br>
Shake cultivation was performed at 37 °C for 8 hours<br>
and the bacteria was recovered and the plasmid was<br>
separated using Wizard Miniprep in accordance with<br>
that attached literature. The plasmid was cleaved with<br>
restriction endonuclease BamHI/XhoI. Insertion of<br>
said PCR product was confirmed by cutting out<br>
approximately 370 bp DNA. The base sequence of the<br>
DNA that had been inserted was determined using said<br>
clone.<br>
Determination of the base sequence of the<br>
inserted DNA fragment was performed using the<br>
Fluorescence Sequencer of Applied Biosystems. The<br>
sequence sample was prepared using PRISM, Ready<br>
Reaction Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied<br>
Biosystems). First-, 9.5 ptl reaction stock solution,<br>
4.0 ul T7 promoter primer at 0.8 pmol/ul (Gibco BRL)<br>
and 6.5 ul template DNA for sequencing at 0.16 ug/ul<br>
were added to a microtube with a capacity of 0.5 ml<br>
-and mixed. After superposition with 100 ul mineral<br>
oil, PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles,<br>
where one cycle consisted of 30 seconds at 96 °C, 15<br>
seconds at 55 °C, and 5 minutes at 60 °C. The product<br>
was then kept at 4 °C for 4 minutes. After the<br>
reaction was completed, 80 pi sterilized pure water<br>
was added and stirred. The product was centrifuged<br>
and the aqueous layer was extracted 3 times with<br>
phenol-chloroform. Ten microliters 3 M sodium<br>
acetate (pH 5.2) and 300 ul ethanol were added to 100<br>
ul aqueous layer and stirred. The product was then<br>
centrifuged for 15 minutes at room temperature and<br>
t4:,0frG -rpm and the sediment was recovered. Once the<br>
sse^imeai was washed warth 75 % ethanol, it was dried<br>
under a vacuum for 2 minutes to obtain the sequencing<br>
sample. The sequencing sample was dissolved in<br>
formamide containing 4 ml 10 mM EDTA and denatured<br>
for 2  minutes at 90 °C. This was then cooled in ice<br>
and submitted to sequencing. One of the 5 clones<br>
obtained had homology of the sequence with the probe<br>
used for PCR. In addition, DNA sequences extremely<br>
similar to the gene sequence of ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 gene of the other microorganisms, for example,<br>
Haemoophilus influenzae, were discovered. The entire<br>
base sequence and the corresponding amino acid<br>
sequence of the structural gene moiety are as shown<br>
in Sequence No. 21 and No. 22 of the Sequence Table.<br>
This gene fragment clearly codes for Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae  ribosomal protein L7/L12.<br>
Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  GST fused ribosome protein<br>
L7/L12 prepared by the same method as in Example 2<br>
was obtained using the Neisseria gonorrhoeae GST<br>
fusion ribosomal protein L7/L12 expression vector<br>
constructed in this way. Furthermore, hybridoma<br>
strain AMGC1, which produces monoclonal antibody to<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,<br>
was obtained in accordance with the method similar to<br>
the method of Example 3. Monoclonal antibody was<br>
produced and recovered in accordance with standard<br>
methods using the positive hybridoma ceils of AMGC1<br>
strain obtained as previously described.<br>
Specifically, cells subcultured in RPMI 1640<br>
medium (containing 10 % FCS) was diluted with a<br>
serum-free medium to about 2 x 105 cells/ml, 3.3 x 105<br>
cells/ml, and 5 X 105 cells/ml in 25 cm2 culture<br>
flasks, and the total was made 5 ml. After cell were<br>
grown for 3 to 5 days in 7 % CO2 at 37 °C, a flask<br>
which contains the least number of original cells was<br>
selected among flasks in which cells were grown. The<br>
same procedure was repeated until the cells diluted<br>
to 2 x 105 cells/ml grow to 2 x 106 cells/ml in 3 to 4<br>
days, thereby adapting the cells with the serum-free<br>
medium. Next, cloning was performed in a 96-well<br>
plate for bacteria cultivation to select cells<br>
exhibiting fastest growth and a highest antibody<br>
titer. The selected cells were grown in a 24-well<br>
plate and diluted with a serum-free medium in a 25<br>
cm2 culture flask to a concentration of about 2 x 10<br>
cells/ml and the total volume was made 10 ml. After<br>
incubation for 3 to A days in 7 % CO2 at 37 °C to a<br>
concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml, the culture broth<br>
100 ml, 1 x 106 cells/ml was transferred to a bottle<br>
for mass cultivation which were grown in the same<br>
manner in a 75 cm2 flask. 100 ml of a serum-free<br>
medium was added to the mixture, which was incubated<br>
at 37 °C for two days while stirring. 2.00 ml of the<br>
serum-free medium J*as- added ajgain and the mixture was<br>
incubated for a. furtfrer two days. -Hie culture broth<br>
was divided into four aliquots, the serum-free medium<br>
was added to each portion, followed by incubation for<br>
two days. After further addition of 400 ml of the<br>
serum-free medium the culture broth was incubated<br>
for 6 days. The culture broth was collected and<br>
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes to obtain a<br>
culture supernatant including the target antibody.<br>
After the addition of sodium azide to final<br>
concentration 0 .1 %, the culture supernatant was<br>
stored at 4 °C. 100 ml of the solution containing the<br>
antibody that was obtained was diluted 5-fold with<br>
PBS and adsorbed in a Protein A column (5 ml bed<br>
volume, Pharmacia) and washed with 3-bed volume of'<br>
PBS. Then eluted with citrate buffer at pH 3, the<br>
antibody fraction was recovered and monoclonal<br>
antibody produced by each hybridoma was obtained.<br>
The monoclonal antibody derived from the hybridoma<br>
was used in ELISA.<br>
To evaluate the antibo-dy, 9-6-well plates<br>
sensitized with ribosornal proteins L7/L12 of various<br>
microorganisms were used as an antigen. The<br>
monoclonal antibody prepared was reacted, followed by<br>
the reaction of horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-<br>
mouse IgG (manufactured by MBL, Code 330) as a<br>
secondary antigen, and finally the antibody was<br>
detected using an eivz^sm x«actioT* cvl<nr reagent.></nr>
In the ELISA reaction, soU&amp;tioms *&gt;t r^csmtbiuan-t<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,<br>
Haemophilus influenzae,  and Streptococcus pneumoniae<br>
dissolved in PBS containing 0.05 % sodium azide<br>
diluted to 1 mg/ml were poured, 100 ml at a time,<br>
into separate 96-well plates and adsorbed overnight<br>
at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant, 200 ml 1%<br>
bovine serum albumin solution (in PBS) were added and<br>
reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the product was<br>
washed worth a washiirg solution (0.02 % Tween 20,<br>
PBS). Solutions of AMGC1 antibody, at concentrations<br>
of 0.1-1 mg/ml, in an amount of 100 ul each, were<br>
added and reacted for two hours at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the product was<br>
further washed with a washing solution. Then, 100 ul<br>
of a solution of 5 mg/ml horse radish peroxidase-<br>
labeled anti-mouse IgG (manufactured by MBL, Code<br>
330) was added and reacted for one hour at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant waa removed and the<br>
product was washed with a washing solution. TMB (KPL)<br>
solution was added, 100 pi at a time, and reacted for<br>
20 minutes at room temperature. After coloration,<br>
100 ul 1 N sulfuric acid were added to stop the<br>
reaction. Absorbance at 450 nm was determined.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 6 it was confirmed<br>
that when the monoclonal antibody orig±natiiig_fxom;<br>
hybridoma AMGC1 was used, this antibody -eaa r^sct<br>
with ribosomal proteins L7/L12 of all bacteria such<br>
as Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  Haemophilus  influenzae,  and<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae.<br>
(+: Positive)<br>
The AMGC1 antibody obtained here is very useful<br>
as an antibody used for the detection of<br>
microorganisms in the so-called sandwich assay by<br>
optical immunoassay and ELISA method, in combination<br>
with an anti-ribosomal protein L7/L12 antibody which<br>
is specific to each microorganism.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, not only<br>
microorganisms can be detected specifically according<br>
to species, but also microorganisms of all serotypes<br>
in the same species can be"detected at a high<br>

WE CLAIM;<br>
1.        Antibodies for detecting bacteria, directed to ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 of bacteria which react specifically with ribosomal<br>
protein L7/L12 of bacteria from which the ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 is isolated and which can distinguish said bacteria<br>
genus or species from other bacteria genus or species,<br>
respectively.<br>
2.        The antibodies as claimed in claim 1, where said bacteria are<br>
bacteria which cause a sexually transmitted disease (STD).<br>
3.        The antibodies as claimed in claim 1, where said bacteria which<br>
cause respiratory tract infection.<br>
4.        The antibody as claimed in claim 3, where the causative<br>
bacteria of respiratory tract infection are bacteria of Hae-<br>
mophilus influenzae.<br>
5.        The antibody as claimed in claim 3, where the causative<br>
bacteria of respiratory tract infection are bacteria of Strep-<br>
tococcus pneumoniae.<br>
6.        The antibody as claimed in claim 2, where the causative<br>
bacteria of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are bacteria of<br>
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.<br>
7.        The antibody as claimed in claim 6, which is the antibody to<br>
ribosomal protein L7/L12 Neisseria gonorrthoeae and which<br>
recognized a continuous amino acid sequence moiety from 5 to<br>
30 amino acids including the 115th alanine in the amino acid<br>
sequence of Sequence ID No. 22 of the Sequence Table.<br>
8.        A reagent kit for detecting bacteria which is characterized by<br>
comprising an antibody as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7.<br>
9.        A method of preparing any antibody described in any one of<br>
claims 1 to 7, characterized by the fact that ribosomal protein<br>
L7/L12 of bacteria obtained by a gene manipulation procedure<br>
or by isolation from bacteria, or a peptide moiety thereof, or a<br>
synthesized peptide corresponding to the peptide moiety is used<br>
as an immunogen.<br><br>
An antibody for detection of microorganisms, a<br>
method of detection of microorganisms, and a reagent kit for detection of microorganisms, which is species specific for every species of microorganisms and with which all serotypes within the same species can be detected, are provided. Antibody to intracellular molecules with the same function in each type of microorganism, particularly antibody to ribosomal protein, that is, ribosomal protein L7/L12, is made and antibody that reacts specifically with the microorganism in question is selected.<br></td>
