				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an encapsulation for a high voltage interrupter.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
High voltage interrupters are typically mounted at<br>
the upper end of an  epoxy or porcelain structure or<br>
encapsulation that includes an internal chamber for<br>
supporting the interrupter and operating rod.	<br>
The structure must be designed to prevent "tracking," i.e., charges from creeping along the surface of the wall of the structure from high potential to a frame which is at ground potential as a result of surface contamination condensing and building up on the surface.  In addition, the structure must be designed to prevent a direct strike of charges between the interrupter and the base.  As a general rule, the length of the surface necessary to prevent creep is longer than that needed to prevent a strike.  Accordingly, the support structures are typically taller than necessary.<br>
In addition, the base of an epoxy encapsulation is bolted to a frame or structure at the bottom end of the support.  Typically threaded nuts are inserted into a mold prior to casting the epoxy encapsulation.  The finished cast product then includes a plurality of nuts that can be used to bolt the encapsulation to a frame. However, on occasion, one or more nuts are omitted or put in at an incorrect angle, thus jeopardizing the final product strength.  In addition, on occasion, uneven loading may cause the insert nuts to pull out, thus also weakening the strength of the structure.<br><br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above-described disadvantages of the prior art by utilizing a design wherein tracking can be avoided without having to create a structure that is taller than necessary to overcome strikes.<br>
It is a further object to provide a design that is simpler to construct than those of the prior art and provides increased strength.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an encapsulation for an interrupter, comprising:<br>
a main body that includes an internal cavity; said internal cavity including a space at a first end thereof for the interrupter;<br>
a second end of said main body including a surface for mounting said encapsulation;<br>
an insert assembly embedded within said second end for facilitating mounting the encapsulation;<br>
said insert assembly including a rigid connector and a plurality of fasteners fixed to said rigid connector.<br>
And also the present invention provides a method of making an encapsulation for an interrupter, comprising the steps of:<br>
providing an insert assembly comprising a plurality of fasteners secured to a rigid connector; and<br>
molding a main body of the encapsulation around the insert assembly.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Turning attention to Figure 1, an encapsulation or support 10 for an interrupter 12 is illustrated.  The encapsulation 10 includes an internal chamber 14, ;hrough which an operating rod (not shown) passes for connecting the interrupter 12 to an activating mechanism (not shown) in the frame 16 below the encapsulation 10.<br>
The encapsulation 10 may be cast from epoxy, or any uther suitable material capable of withstanding the stresses that occur during activation of the interrupter 12. In a preferred embodiment, cycloaliphatic prefilled hot-curing two-component epoxy resin is used to form the encapsulation.<br>
If the distance between the interrupter 12 and the frame 16 is insufficient, a phenomenon known as striking may occur, in which a charge jumps from the interrupter 12 to the frame 16.  Accordingly, the distance between the interrupter 12 and the frame 16 must be kept greater than a predetermined distance, i.e., the strike distance, depending upon the conditions and voltages at which the interrupter 12 is being used.<br>
In addition, a charge may creep along the internal wall 18 or surface of the internal chamber 14. Accordingly, the length of the wall 18 should be kept greater than a certain distance to prevent creep. Typically the distance necessary to prevent creep is greater than the strike distance.  Accordingly, in order to prevent creep, the prior art structures were designed taller than was necessary to prevent strikes.<br>
According to the present invention, convolutions 20<br><br>
are designed into the internal wall 18 in order to increase the overall length of the internal wall 18 so as to decrease the likelihood of creep.  As a result of the increased length of the wall added by the convolutions 20, creep can be avoided without having to make the encapsulation 10 taller than is necessary to avoid strikes.<br>
The convolutions 20 can be as wide and deep as molding and mechanical constraints allow.  In a preferred embodiment, each convolution 20 is about one-half inch deep, adding about one inch of creep distance per convolution 20.<br>
The convolutions 20 can be cast by inserting a ram	'<br>
or core into the internal chamber 14 during the casting process.  By designing the walls 22 of the convolutions 20 substantially parallel to the internal wall 18 of the internal chamber 14, the ram can be easily inserted and withdrawn.<br>
An additional benefit of the design of the internal chamber 14 is that, as a result of the convolutions 20, the internal wall is formed by a plurality of overlapping skirt-like sections 24.  Thus, if moisture is trapped inside the internal chamber 14 should condense, resulting in water flowing down the wall 18, the water will drop from each of the convolutions 20, thus preventing a continuous stream of water that would contribute to tracking.  In a sense, each of the skirts 24 acts as an umbrella to prevent the underlying skirts 24 from becoming wet.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the wall IS of the chamber 14 includes two convolutions 20.  Other quantities of convolutions 20 may be used depending on the particular application of the interrupter 12.<br>
Alternatively, the increase of the overall wall length may be achieved during casting by the use of a<br><br>
threaded ram which may be withdrawn from the mold cavity subsequent to casting by rotating the ram to unscrew it from the casting.  The thread 118 cast into the inner wall 18 may extend for more than 360° and may be one-half inch deep.  Figure 9 is a cross section of an encapsulation formed with a threaded ram.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a mechanical stress analysis of a portion of the encapsulation 10 of Figure 1,  As illustrated in Figure 2, the peak mechanical stress is about 5 X 10s N/m3 when a cantilevered load of 25 pounds is applied to an end of an arm extending from the top of the encapsulation.  The stress is well below the strength of the epoxy.  Accordingly, the convolutions 20 do not compromise the strength of the encapsulation 10.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the electrical stress of the encapsulation 10.  In particular, Figure 3 illustrates the voltage distribution about the chamber 14.  Figure 4 illustrates the electric field (stress), i.e., the gradient voltage variation, of the chamber 14.<br>
To support the encapsulation 10 and interrupter 12, threaded nuts 2 6 are insertted into the base of the encapsulation 10 during the casting process. Preferably, the nuts 26  are equally spaced in a circular pattern.  Bolts (not shown) are then used to fasten the encapsulation 10 to the frame IS.<br>
To facilitate assembly and to increase the strength of the finished product, the nuts 2 6 are prearranged on an insert assembly 28.  The assembly 28  preferably includes a pair of rings 30, 32 concentrically arranged. See Figures 5 and 6.  The threaded nuts 26 may be welded, or otherwise secured, to the rings 30, 32.  In a preferred embodiment, eight nuts 2 6 are equally spaced at 45* between the concentric rings 30, 32.  The approximate diameter of the insert assembly 28 is 4.6 inches.<br><br>
The insert assembly 28 may be inserted into a mold prior to casting the encapsulation 10 so, as can be seen in Figure 2, the stress values detected near the rings 30, 32 are relatively low.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a voltage potential where an encapsulation 10, with the insert assembly 28, is bolted to a structure which also contains a high voltage potential.  Figure 8 illustrates the electric field (stress) around the rings 30, 32.  As can be seen, the rings 30, 32 act to smooth out the electric field below its breakdown value.<br>
Although only preferred embodiments are specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
