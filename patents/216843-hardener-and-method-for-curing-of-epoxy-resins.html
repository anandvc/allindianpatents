				<td>Epoxy resin curing agent for enhanced wear resistance and weatherability of cured materials<br>
The invention concerns a hardener for epoxy resins which produce materials with very high colour<br>
stability, abrasion, scratch and chemical resistance. The invention also pertains a method for<br>
curing an epoxy resin utilizing such a hardener as well as a cured epoxy material manufactured in<br>
this manner.<br>
Background<br>
Commercially available epoxy resins in combination with commercially available hardeners<br>
produce materials with a broad application as coatings for corrosion protection, components of<br>
composite materials and as moulding plastics. In addition to the basic components of epoxy resin<br>
and hardener the starting materials may contain dyes, pigments, fillers, reactive and non-reactive<br>
diluents, volatile solvents, stabilizing agents and additives.<br>
Epoxy resins usually contain more than one 1,2-epoxy group per mole and may be based on<br>
saturated, unsaturated, aromatic, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic structures.<br>
Hardeners are usually chosen from the following groups of chemical compounds: aromatic,<br>
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic amines, amine adducts, polyamides, polyamido amides,<br>
Mannich bases, ketimines or carboxylic acid derivatives. Mercaptan compounds can also be used<br>
as active compounds within the hardener.<br>
Fillers include titanium dioxide, silica, diverse silicates, minerals or carbon black.<br>
Stabilisers include antioxidants, radical scavengers or UV-absorbers.<br>
Additives include plasticizers, catalysts for the curing reaction, rheology modifying additives or<br>
surfactants.<br>
Reactive diluents are often epoxy compounds of considerably lower viscosity than the epoxy<br>
resins.<br>
It is known that the colour stability of materials which are made from commercially available<br>
epoxy resins and hardeners is often poor because the hardeners or combination of hardener, resin<br>
and additives, have a strong tendency to yellowing, also after curing. A known method of<br>
reducing yellowing is to use amine based hardeners with aliphatic or cycloaliphatic structures,<br>
because in the presence of light the yellowing of cycloaliphatic amines is significantly less than<br>
that of aromatic amines.<br>
The disadvantage of using aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines as hardeners or curing agents is that<br>
the abrasion and scratch resistance of the resulting materials is often poorer than for aromatic<br>
amines.<br>
It is also known that the abrasion, scratch and chemical resistance of cured epoxies can be<br>
significantly improved by the use of fillers such as silica (US 3794609). The disadvantage<br><br>
however is that the transparency of the hardened epoxy is considerably reduced, which is<br>
perceived as detrimental, particularly when the material is intended for use as coating.<br>
A known method of producing cured epoxies with high colour stability, abrasion, scratch and<br>
chemical resistance, and acceptable transparency can therefore be to use hardeners based on<br>
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines with low yellowing tendency together with silica based<br>
nanoparticles as an additive. One example of silica based nanoparticles is the Aerosil® products<br>
of Degussa AG, Germany. From EP 0774443 A1 it is known that nanodisperse titanium dioxide is<br>
suitable for improving the colour stability of, amongst others, polymer based formulations.<br>
An alternative method for the preparation of coatings with good abrasion, scratch and chemical<br>
resistance together with acceptable transparency is based on organic, polymer forming components<br>
and inorganic, particle containing or particle forming components where the particle size is<br>
between 1 and 150 nm. The coating is usually cured by applying the mixture of organic and<br>
inorganic components to a surface and drying with the aid of heat and/or UV-VIS radiation. Such<br>
coating forming mixtures may contain epoxy resins or compounds with epoxy groups. A large<br>
number of patents and publications exist which describe the preparation of such organic-inorganic<br>
hybrid materials and possible applications: JP 09132637, US 5618860, US 5804616, WO 9832792<br>
EP 496552, KR 2000059589, JP 2001288401 and Milena Spirkova et. al. "Hybrid Organic-<br>
Inorganic Epoxide-Based Coatings Prepared by Sol-Gel Process", Proceedings of 6th Nürnberg<br>
Congress on Creative Advances in Coatings Technology ", paper 12 (2001).<br>
Thermosetting plastics such as epoxy resins can also be modified with nanodisperse inorganic<br>
particles for applications other than coatings. DE 198 60 691 A1 describes a magnetic paste which<br>
contains nanocrystals. WO 9631572 Al describes polymerisable, nanoparticle containing<br>
formulations which, amongst others, are based on acrylic or epoxy resins and which can be used<br>
for building up or joining of optoelectronic elements. WO 0130304 A1 describes materials which<br>
are based on organic thermosets and inorganic nanoparticle containing or nanoparticle forming<br>
components. The materials are used as dental replacement materials. In addition a number of<br>
scientific publications describe the modification of thermosetting plastics such as epoxy resins<br>
with nanoparticle containing or nanoparticle forming mixtures (e.g. Soo-Jin Park et. al. "Surface<br>
Modification of Montmorillonite on Surface Acid-Base Characteristics of Clay and Thermal<br>
Stability of Epoxy/Clay Nanocomposites ", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 251, 160-165<br>
(2002)).<br>
Also the preparation of nitrogen containing, basic hardeners or curing agents with hydrolisable<br>
silane compounds for thermosets such as epoxy resins is known. US 4988778 describes hardeners<br>
which are prepared by partial alcoholysis/ aminolysis of y-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane with<br>
diisopropyl amine, but without the addition of water. JP 04366159 describes a product which is<br>
made by the reaction of ?-glycidopropyltrimethoxy silane with water and small quantities of an<br><br>
amidine compound l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undeken-7 and which is used as a subcomponent for<br>
curing of an epoxy containing thermosetting mixture. The basic amidine compound constitutes<br>
however less than 62 ppm by weight of the silane/water mixture thus the product itself must be<br>
considered as unsuitable as a hardener for epoxy resins.<br>
It is also shown in PCT/NO2001/00287 that an existing organic lacquer or gelcoat can be modified<br>
with suitable nanoparticle mixtures to, amongst other things, give improved scratch resistance.<br>
Here a stable nanoparticle containing sol is prepared which is added to the existing organic<br>
lacquer or gelcoat as required.<br>
However, we believe, that the use of sol-gel mixtures, which are prepared by controlled<br>
hydrolysis/condensation of ?-aminopropyltrialkoxy silane or other nitrogen containing silanes<br>
and/or mercaptosilanes as hardener for epoxy resins has not been documented.<br>
The sol-gel process is a simple way of preparing nanoparticle based mixtures. The sol-gel process<br>
is based on a controlled hydrolysis/condensation of e.g. silane alkoxides. The process is described<br>
in PCT/NO2001/00287 and yields gels which relatively easily can be mixed into polymeric and/or<br>
polymerisable organic formulations.<br>
One example is sols which are prepared by controlled hydrolysis/condensation of ?-<br>
aminopropyltrialkoxy silane. The sol-gel process is in this case particularly simple because an<br>
external catalyst is not required and because the process can be performed at room temperature or<br>
with gentle heating.<br>
Known hardeners for epoxy resins are based on amines such as 4,4"-diaminodiphenylmethane (I)<br>
or meta-xylylenediamine (II):<br><br>
Amines react with epoxy resins by crosslinking with two or more polymer chains in the epoxy<br>
resins. This leads to solidification (hardening) of the two component system which consists of<br>
amine based hardener and epoxy resin and the formation of a relatively abrasion resistant material.<br>
The disadvantage of amine based hardeners is that the hardened material yellows relatively quickly<br>
due to, amongst other things, oxidative degradation of components in the amine based hardener.<br><br>
In addition the abrasion/scratch resistance of the hardened material is often too poor for the<br>
material to be used for demanding applications.<br>
Objective<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a hardener for epoxy resins that provides cured<br>
epoxy materials with high abrasion resistance and photostability.<br>
It is a further object to provide a hardener as mentioned above that provides materials with high<br>
transparency and clarity.<br>
It is still further an object of the invention to provide such a hardener that is easy to manufacture in<br>
industrial scale, have a long shelf life and that is readily able to cure epoxy resins under normal<br>
conditions.<br>
The invention<br>
In a first aspect the invention relates to a hardener for epoxy resins defined by the features<br>
disclosed in the characterising part of claim 1.<br>
According to a second aspect the invention relates to a cured epoxy resin as defined by claim 15.<br>
According to a third aspect the invention concerns a method for curing epoxy resins as defined by<br>
claim 16.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed by the dependent claims.<br>
The first aspect of the invention concerns sol-gel based hardeners which can be used for curing<br>
epoxy resins. In a first step a sol is prepared by controlled hydrolysis/condensation of suitable<br>
amine containing hydrolisable and condensable silane compounds. Suitable amine containing<br>
hydrolisable and condensable silane compounds are those comprised by the formula:<br>
(X-B-)n Si(-Y)4-n (III)<br>
where n=l or 2, X=SH, -N=C=O or NR1R2. NR1R2 is chosen among hydrogen, saturated<br>
or unsaturated C1-C18-alkyl, substituted or not substituted aryl, formyl, aliphatic or<br>
aromatic carbonyl, carbamoyl, sulfphonyl, sulphoxyl, phosphonyl, sulphinyl, phosphinyl,<br>
wherin the carbon chains in said compounds optionally may contain one or more the<br>
elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorous, silicon, and boron, and/ or optionally<br>
containing one or more hydrolysable silane units, or R1, R2 are chosen among<br>
condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical compounds<br>
such as acids, alchohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes or epoxides.<br><br>
A simple way to prepare nanoparticle based compositions is the sol-gel process. The sol-gel<br>
process is based on controlled hydrolysis/ condensation of e.g silane oxides. The process is<br>
described in PCT/NO2001/00287 and results in gels that are comparatively easily mixable with<br>
polymer containing or polymerizable organic formulations. One example is the preparation of sols<br>
by controlled hydrolysis/ condensation of y-aminopropyltrialkoxysilane. In this case the sol-gel<br>
process is particularly simple as no catalyst is required and the process may be conducted at<br>
ambient temperature or with only slight warming.<br>
The main difference in this invention in relation to the inventions in the above mentioned patents<br>
and the results of the above mentioned publications is as follows: In the first step a stable sol is<br>
prepared by controlled hydrolysis/condensation of a suitable, possibly appropriately modified,<br>
silane compound. When stored under favourable conditions the product may be stable for six<br>
months or longer. In the second step the sol is mixed with suitable epoxy resins, to give cured<br>
materials with improved colour stability, abrasion, scratch and chemical resistance. As far as the<br>
inventors know, no prior art describes stable sols with long stability as hardeners for epoxy resins<br>
with two or more components.<br>
Controlled hydrolysis/condensation of compounds as described in the characterisation part of<br>
patent claim 1 generally results in a sol where the particle forming or oligomeric condensate<br>
products have several more or less free amino groups on the surface. Thus these particles or<br>
oligomers can react with thermosets such as epoxy resins by crosslinking with two or more<br>
polymer chains in the thermoset, in the same way as the known amine based hardeners (I) and (II).<br>
A corresponding curing reaction is possible with sols prepared by controlled hydrolysis<br>
/condensation of other nitrogen containing silane compounds or mercaptosilanes, provided that the<br>
sol contains particles or oligomers with a sufficiently large number of more or less free amino<br>
groups and/or mercaptan groups. Generally the reaction products of the sol-gel process such as<br>
alcohol or excess water must be removed before the sol can be used as a hardener or as a<br>
component of a hardener for epoxy resins.<br>
The crosslinking reaction and therefore the curing reaction between particle forming condensate<br>
products with more or less free amino groups on the surface and an epoxy can be described as in<br>
(IV):<br><br><br>
Sometimes the stability of the sol can be too short, especially after the reaction products from the<br>
sol-gel process such as alcohols or excess water have been removed. Also the rate of the curing<br>
reaction between the sol and epoxy resin may be far from optimal such that the curing reaction<br>
may be too fast or too slow. Adjustment of the rate of the curing reaction is desirable in such cases.<br>
It may also be cases where that the compatibility and therefore the miscibility of the sol and the<br>
epoxy resin are not good enough, which may, e.g., result in inadequate material properties in the<br>
cured material. Also in such cases adjustment of compatibility is required. Modification of the<br>
prepared sol by an appropriate chemical conversion can therefore be advantageous.<br>
Suitable chemical conversions to modify the prepared sol have the aim to modify more or less free<br>
amino groups at the surface of the particle forming condensate product. Such conversions are<br>
conducted between more or less free amino groups at the surface of a particle forming condensate<br>
product and reactive compounds that preferably reacts quantitatively with the more or less free<br>
amino groups at temperatures T 
compounds are epoxides, acid derivatives, blocked and unblocked isocyanates and compounds R-<br>
X comprised of<br>
a) A suitable atom or an atom group X and<br>
b) a group R<br><br>
wherein R-X is able to react with more or less free amino groups in a substitution reaction by<br>
which an atom or atom group X is replaced by an amino group (Endre Berner, "Laerebok i<br>
organisk kjemi", Aschehoug &amp; Co., Oslo (1964), p. 144-147) and where the group R is chosen<br>
from non-substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-C24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated C1,<br>
C24-alkyi, substituted or non-substituted aryl, aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, wherein the carbon<br>
chains of said compounds may optionally include one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen,<br>
sulphur, silicon and boron, or groups chosen among condensation products or addition products o1<br>
one or more types of chemical compounds such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes or<br>
epoxides, and<br>
the atom or an atom group X preferably chosen among halogen, substituted or non-substituted<br>
alkoxyl, phenoxyl, amine, carboxylate, sulphonate, sulphinate, phosphonate or phosphinate.<br>
Examples of suitable epoxides are monoglycidyl compounds that may be described as<br><br>
where R1 is chosen among groups such as hydrogen, non-substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-<br>
C24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-C24-alkyl, substituted or non-substituted aryl,<br>
aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, wherein the carbon chains of said compounds may optionally<br>
include one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, silicon and boron, or Rl is chosen<br>
among condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical compounds<br>
such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aidehyd s or epoxides.<br>
Examples of suitable epoxides are furthermore compounds with epoxidized C=C double bonds<br>
that may be described as<br><br>
wherein R1 - R4 are chosen among groups such as hydrogen, non-substituted saturated or<br>
unsaturated C1-C24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-C24-alkyl, substituted or non-<br>
substituted aryl, aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, wherein the carbon chains of said compounds n<br>
optionally include one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, silicon and boron, or<br><br>
is chosen among condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical<br>
compounds such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes or epoxides<br>
Examples of suitable acid derivatives are<br><br>
where R1 is chosen among groups such as hydrogen, non-substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-<br>
C24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-C24-alkyl, substituted or non-substituted aryl,<br>
aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, wherein the carbon chains of said compounds may optionally<br>
include one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, silicon and boron, or Rl is chosen<br>
among condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical compounds<br>
such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes or epoxides, and<br>
X is a suitable removable group such as halogen, substituted or non-substituted alkoxy, phenoxy,<br>
amine, carboxylate, sulphonate, sulphinate, phosphonate or phosphinate.<br>
Examples of suitable isocyanates may be described as<br><br>
where R1 is chosen among groups such as hydrogen, non-substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-<br>
C24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-C24-alkyl, substituted or non-substituted aryl,<br>
aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, wherein the carbon chains of said compounds may optionally<br>
include one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, silicon and boron, or R1 is chosen<br>
among condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical compounds<br><br>
such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes or epoxides, and wherein the isocyanate group<br>
may be blocked by means of known chemical substances.<br>
In the crosslinking process and thus the curing process between particle forming condensation<br>
products and more or less free amino groups at the surface of epoxy resins, addition products of<br>
the following type are formed:<br><br>
In the same manner addition products are formed when more or less free amino groups are<br>
converted with isocyanates:<br><br>
Thus, particle forming condensation products with more or (ess free amino groups at the surface<br>
may also be used in the crosslinking process and thus the curing process of isocyanate-based<br>
resins, which leads to the formation of so-called polyuretanes.<br>

added and the reaction mixture held at 70 °C for one hour. A clear yellow product is obtained<br>
that is viscous gel at 10 °C and a low viscous liquid at 80 °C. This product reacts significantly<br>
slower in a curing process with commercially available reaction products from the conversion<br>
of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane and epichlorohydrin than the reaction product from 11.<br><br>
14. 100 g reaction product from 11 is heated to 70 °C to obtain a clear liquid. Then 150 g<br>
glycidyf-2-methylphenylether (CAS [2210-79-9]; Araldite DY-K, Vantico AG, Switzerland)is<br>
added and the reaction mixture heid at 70 °C for one hour. A clear yellow product is obtained<br>
that is viscous gel at 10 °C and a low viscous liquid at 80 °C. In contradiction to the reaction<br>
product from 11, this product does not react in a curing process with commercially available<br>
reaction products from the conversion of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane and<br>
epichlorohydrin.<br>
Characterisation and testing:<br>
Sol particle size<br>
The particle size of the sol was measured using the light scattering principle. A commercial<br>
instrument, "Zetasizer 3" from Malvern, UK, was used for the determination of size distribution.<br>
The size distribution was sharp and the average particle size was less than 5 nm for the sols<br><br>
prepared according to Examples 1-3,<br>
Abrasion properties<br>
Abrasion properties were tested using a Universal Wear Testing Machine from Eyre/Bicere -<br>
apparatus. The constant weight was 588g (3X load). A relatively large number of scratches were<br>
made on a plate made in accordance with Example 9. On a plate made in accordance with<br>
Example 4 the scratches are barely visible.<br>
Scratch resistance/ abrasion properties as determined by to Erichsen test<br>
The scratch resistance/ abrasion test was investigated by means of a hardness pen of Erichsen type<br>
(Erichsen, Germany). The method is based on making a scratch with the hardness pen. The force<br>
exerted during the test is controlled by a spring. The hardness value related to the force is read<br>
from the hardness pen in Newton [N]. At least three parallel measurements are made to each<br>
sample. It is recorded when the force does not provide visible scratches and at what force the first<br>
visible scratch is obtained. The test was conducted on a series of plates prepared as described by<br>
Example 8. It is shown that the force required to make scratches on plates made with modified<br>
hardener, is at least 40 times greater than the force required to make scratches on the plates made<br>
with commercial amine based hardeners. The results are given in table 3.<br><br><br>
Accelerated ageing and measurement of colour/ brightness<br>
The epoxy plates made in accordance with Example 14 were subjected to accelerated ageing<br>
according to ISO 4892-3 for 426 hours. The test instrument was an ATLAS UVCON weather-o-<br>
meter (Atlas Inc., USA) furnished with UVA-340 fluorescence lamps. The test cycle comprised 4<br>
hours UV radiation at dry heating to 45 °C, 30 minutes of water sprinkling at 10-12 °C and 3 hours<br>
and 30 minutes of condensation at 40 °C.<br>
The colours of the plates were measured prior to the accelerated ageing and subsequent the<br>
accelerated ageing according to ASTM 2244.<br>
Colour measured in so-called outdoor light, D65, 10°<br>
Reference standard White (33112035N)<br>
Colour difference in ClE-lab DL, Da, Db and DE<br>
Total colour change DE<br>
Colour coordinates DL(white/black), Da(red/green) and Db(yellow/blue)<br>
Typical results of the colour measurements are shown in table 4.<br><br><br>
The brightness measurements were conducted according to ISO 2813. The results are shown in<br>
table 5. Brightness was measured in one single spot. The apparatus is a Byk Gardner multi tri<br>
gloss 20 °, 60 ° and 85 °. Due to the fact that brightness reflection at 60 provides more than 100%<br>
brightness, table 5 shows values measured with an angle of incidence of 85 °. Typical results of<br>
the colour measurements are shown in table 5.<br><br>
It is evident that epoxy plates based on the hardener of the system according to the present<br>
invention (Plate/ sample No. 1-IV) exhibit significantly less colour change and/ or loss of<br>
brightness than do the epoxy plates not based on such a hardener (Plate/ sample No. V).<br>
The brightness reduction is caused by chemical degradation of the plates. Thus, plates that<br>
subsequent to accelerated ageing shows little or no brightness reduction have better qualifications<br>
with respect to their ability to resist degradation from chemicals such as acids or basic liquids than<br>
do plates that exhibit comparatively large brightness reduction.<br><br>
