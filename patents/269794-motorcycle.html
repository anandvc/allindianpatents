[0040]<br>
Moreover, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the inner side of the front cowl 33 is open forward of the vehicle, so that it is possible to easily get access to the inclination sensor 70 from the forward direction of the vehicle and it is unnecessary to detach any parts other than the inclination sensor 70 when the inclination sensor is removed.  Moreover, the inclination sensor 70 is arranged at the more downward position than the upper end of the head pipe 12, so that the inclination sensor 70 is close to the engine 50 which is a vibration<br><br>
source, and the inclination sensor 70 can be arranged in a position in which amplification of the vibration of the engine 50 is reduced.  Moreover, the inclination sensor 70 is arranged at the more upvjard position than the upper end of the front fender 37, so that when the maintenance, etc. are performed, the front fender 37 is difficult to disturb the maintenance etc., and the attaching/detaching operation of the inclination sensor 70 can be easily performed. Moreover, the muddy water, stones, etc. which are splashed by the wheel etc. can be made difficult to hit the inclination sensor 70, thanks to the front fender 37. Moreover, the inclination sensor 70 is arranged inside the front cowl 33, so that it is possible to cause the muddy water, stones, etc. to be more difficult to hit the inclination sensor 70, while providing the easy access to the inclination sensor 70 from the forward direction. Moreover, the inclination sensor 70 is arranged at the more forward position than the engine 50, so that the inclination sensor 70 is difficult to be subjected to heat of the engine 50 and is made easy to be subjected to traveling wind. [0041]<br>
Moreover, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the main harness 48 which bundles the wires for the meter and lighting equipment is wired on the left side of the main frame 13 and the inclination sensor 70 is arranged on the left side of the main frame 13, so that the wire of the inclination sensor 70 is not required to be<br><br>
wired astride the main frame 13 in order that the wire of the inclination sensor 70 is merged with the main harness ■4 8.  Thus, the wire of the inclination sensor 70 can be made shorter as compared to a case where the inclination sensor 70 is arranged on the right side of the main frame 13. [0042]<br>
Moreover, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the inclination sensor 70 is arranged at the more inward position of the vehicle than the front fork 21, as viewed from the front side of the vehicle, so that the inclination sensor 70 is arranged adjacent a center line C of the vehicle (refer to Fig. 2) .  Thus, the tilt of the motorcycle 10 can be detected with high-precision and the inclination sensor 70 can be prevented from being projected outward of the vehicle. [0043]<br>
Moreover, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the inclination sensor 70 is arranged forward of the gusset 18 to the extent that it is superposed on the down tube 17 at the lower part of the gusset 18, thus providing the easy access to the inclination sensor 70. [0044]<br>
Moreover, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the bolts 93, 95 for attachment of the inclination sensor 70 and the horn 72 are adapted to be threadedly attached from the forward portion of the vehicle vjhich is open, so that the attaching/detaching operation of<br><br>
the inclination sensor 70 and the horn 72 can be easily<br>
performed.<br>
[0045]<br>
Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment illustratively described above and various modifications can be suitably made to the embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention claimed.<br>
While the case where the inclination sensor 70 and the horn 72 are arranged on the left side of the gusset 18 has been illustratively discussed above in connection with the embodiment, the present invention is not limited to such a case and, for example, the inclination sensor 70 and the horn 72 may be arranged on the right side of the gusset 18 [Brief Description of the Drawings] [0046]<br>
