This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/687,715, filed June 6, 2005, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]        The present invention relates to novel 7,8-dihydro-imidazo[l,2-fl]pyrazolo[4,3-e]pyrimidin-4-one compounds and 7,8,9-trihydro-[l Hor 2H]-pyrimido [l,2-a]pyrazolo[4,3-e]pyrimidin-4(5H)-one compounds, processes for their production, their use as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. Of particular interest are novel compounds useful as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1), e.g., in the treatment of diseases involving disorders of the dopamine Dl receptor intracellular pathway, such as Parkinson's disease, depression and damage to cognitive function, e.g., in schizophrenia.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]        Eleven families of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been identified but only PDEs in Family I, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterases (CaM-PDEs), have been shown to mediate the calcium and cyclic nucleotide (e.g. cAMP and cGMP) signaling pathways. The three known CaM-PDE genes, PDE1A, PDE1B, and PDE1C, are all expressed in central nervous system tissue. PDE1A is expressed throughout the brain with higher levels of expression in the CA1 to CA3 layers of the hippocampus and cerebellum and at a low level in the striatum. PDE1A is also expressed in the lung and heart. PDE1B is predominately expressed in the striatum, dentate gyrus, olfactory tract and cerebellum, and its expression correlates with brain regions having high levels of dopaminergic innervation. Although PDE1B is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, it may be detected in the heart. PDE1C is primarily expressed in olfactory epithelium, cerebellar granule cells, and striatum. PDE1C is also expressed in the heart and vascular smooth muscle.<br>
[0003]        Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases decrease intracellular cAMP and cGMP signaling by hydrolyzing these cyclic nucleotides to their respective inactive 5'-monophosphates (5'AMP and 5'GMP). CaM-PDEs play a critical role in mediating signal transduction in brain cells, particularly within an area of the brain known as thebasal ganglia or striatum. For example, NMDA-type glutamate receptor activation and/or dopamine D2 receptor activation result in increased intracellular calcium concentrations, leading to activation of effectors such as calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin and to activation of CaM-PDEs, resulting in reduced cAMP and cGMP. Dopamine Dl receptor activation, on the other hand, leads to activation of calcium dependent nucleotide cyclases, resulting in increased cAMP and cGMP. These cyclic nucleotides in turn activate protein kinase A (PKA; cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and/or protein kinase G (PKG; cGMP-dependent protein kinase) that phosphorylate downstream signal transduction pathway elements such as DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein) and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB).<br>
[0004]       CaM-PDEs can therefore affect dopamine-regulated and other intracellular signaling pathways in the basal ganglia (striatum), including but not limited to nitric oxide, noradrenergic, neurotensin, CCK, VIP, serotonin, glutamate (e.g., NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor), GABA, acetylcholine, adenosine (e.g., A2A receptor), cannabinoid receptor, natriuretic peptide (e.g., ANP, BNP, CNP) and endorphin intracellular signaling pathways.<br>
[0005]       Phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, in particular, phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) activity, functions in brain tissue as a regulator of locomotor activity and learning and memory. PDE1 is a therapeutic target for regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, preferably in the nervous system, including but not limited to a dopamine Dl receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, nitric oxide, noradrenergic, neurotensin, CCK, VIP, serotonin, glutamate (e.g., NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor), GABA, acetylcholine, adenosine (e.g., A2A receptor), cannabinoid receptor, natriuretic peptide (e.g., ANP, BNP, CNP) or endorphin intracellular signaling pathway. For example, inhibition of PDE IB should act to potentiate the effect of a dopamine Dl agonist by protecting cGMP and cAMP from degradation, and should similarly inhibit dopamine D2 receptor signaling pathways, by inhibiting PDE1 activity. Chronic elevation in intracellular calcium is linked to cell death in numerous disorders, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzhemer's Parkinson's and Huntington's Diseases, and in disorders of the circulatory system leading to stroke and myocardial infarction. PDE1 inhibitors are therefore potentially useful in diseases characterized by reduced dopamine Dl receptor signaling activity, such as Parkinson's disease, restless<br>
leg syndrome, depression, and cognitive impairment.<br>
[0006]       There is thus a need for compounds that selectively inhibit PDE1 activity,<br>
especially PDE1B activity.<br>
 <br>

intended for use as Pharmaceuticals, therefore pharmaceutically acceptable salts are<br>
preferred. Salts which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses may be useful, for<br>
example, for the isolation or purification of free Compounds of the Invention or their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are therefore also included.<br>
[0019]	Compounds of the Invention may in some cases also exist in prodrug<br>
form. For example when the compounds contain hydroxy or carboxy substituents, these substituents may form physiologically hydrolysable and acceptable esters. As used herein, "physiologically hydrolysable and acceptable ester" means esters of Compounds of the Invention which are hydrolysable under physiological conditions to yield acids (in the case of Compounds of the Invention which have hydroxy substituents) or alcohols (in the case of Compounds of the Invention which have carboxy substituents) which are themselves physiologically tolerable at doses to be administered. As will be appreciated the term thus embraces conventional pharmaceutical prodrug forms.<br>
[0020]	The invention also provides methods of making the Compounds of the<br>
Invention, novel intermediates useful for making Compounds of the Invention, and methods of using the Compounds of the Invention for treatment of diseases and disorders as set forth below (especially treatment of diseases characterized by reduced dopamine Dl receptor signaling activity, such as Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, depression, and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia).<br>

disorders, cognitive impairment, dementia, psychostimulant<br>
withdrawal, and drug addiction; (iii)     Circulatory and cardiovascular disorders, including cerebrovascular<br>
disease, stroke, congestive heart disease, hypertension, pulmonary<br>
hypertension, and sexual dysfunction; (iv)      Respiratory and inflammatory disorders, including asthma, chronic<br>

pathways) in cells expressing PDE1.<br>
comprising administering an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention to a human or animal patient in need thereof.<br>
[0062]        The invention also provides a method for enhancing or potentiating dopamine Dl intracellular signaling activity in a cell or tissue comprising contacting said cell or tissue with an amount of a Compound of the Invention sufficient to inhibit PDEIB activity.<br>

example for use in any method or in the treatment of any disease or<br>
condition as hereinbefore set forth, (ii)      the use of a Compound of the Invention in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for treating any disease or condition as hereinbefore set<br>
forth, and (iii)      a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Compound of the<br>

acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
[0065]	The words "treatment" and "treating" are to be understood accordingly<br>
as embracing prophylaxis and treatment or amelioration of symptoms of disease as well as treatment of the cause of the disease<br>
[0066]	Compounds of the Invention are in particular useful for the treatment of<br>
Parkinson's disease.<br>
[0067]	Compounds of the Invention may be used as a sole therapeutic agent,<br>
but may also be used in combination or for co-administration with other active agents. For example, as Compounds of the Invention potentiate the activity of Dl agonists, such as dopamine, they may be simultaneously, sequentially, or contemporaneously administered with conventional dopaminergic medications, such as levodopa and levodopa adjuncts (carbidopa, COMT inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors), dopamine agonists, and anticholinergics, e.g., in the treatment of a patient having Parkinson's disease.<br>
[0068]	Dosages employed in practicing the present invention will of course<br>
vary depending, e.g. on the particular disease or condition to be treated, the particular Compound of the Invention used, the mode of administration, and the therapy desired. Compounds of the Invention may be administered by any suitable route, including orally, parenterally, transdermally, or by inhalation, but are preferably administered orally. In general, satisfactory results, e.g. for the treatment of diseases as hereinbefore set forth are indicated to be obtained on oral administration at dosages of the order from about 0.01 to 2.0 mg/kg. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage for oral administration will accordingly be in the range of from about 0.75 to 150 mg, conveniently administered once, or in divided doses 2 to 4 times, daily or in sustained release form. Unit dosage forms for oral administration thus for example may comprise from about 0.2 to 75 or 150 mg, e.g. from about 0.2 or 2.0 to 50, 75 or 100 mg of a Compound of the Invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
[0069]	Pharmaceutical compositions comprising Compounds of the Invention<br>
may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets, capsules, solutions, suspensions and the like.<br>

Example 24<br>
Measurement of PDEIB inhibition in vitro using IMAP Phosphodiesterase Assay<br>
Kit<br>
[0113]	Phosphodiesterase IB (PDEIB) is a calcium/calmodulin dependent<br>
phosphodiesterase enzyme that converts cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to<br>
5'-guanosine monophosphate (5'-GMP). PDEIB can also convert a modified cGMP<br>
substrate, such as the fluorescent molecule cGMP-fluorescein, to the corresponding GMP-fluorescein. The generation of GMP-fluorescein from cGMP-fluorescein can be quantitated, using, for example, the IMAP (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) immobilized-metal affinity particle reagent.<br>
[0114]	Briefly, the IMAP reagent binds with high affinity to the free 5'-<br>
phosphate that is found in GMP-fluorescein and not in cGMP-fluorescein. The<br>
resulting GMP-fluorescein - IMAP complex is large relative to cGMP-fluorescein.<br>
Small fluorophores that are bound up in a large, slowly tumbling, complex can be<br>
distinguished from unbound fluorophores, because the photons emitted as they<br>
fluoresce retain the same polarity as the photons used to excite the fluorescence.<br>
[0115]	In the phosphodiesterase assay, cGMP-fluorescein, which cannot be<br>
bound to IMAP, and therefore retains little fluorescence polarization, is converted to<br>
GMP-fluorescein, which, when bound to IMAP, yields a large increase in fluorescence<br>
polarization (Amp). Inhibition of phosphodiesterase, therefore, is detected as a<br>
decrease in Amp.<br>
[0116]	Enzyme assay<br>
Materials: All chemicals are available from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) except for IMAP reagents (reaction buffer, binding buffer, FL-GMP and IMAP beads), which are available from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
Assay: 3',5'-cyclic-nucleotide-specific bovine brain phosphodiesterase (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO) is reconstituted with 50% glycerol to 2.5 U/ml. One unit of enzyme will<br>
hydrolyze 1.0 umole of 3',5'-cAMP to 5'-AMP per min at pH 7.5 at 30Â°C. One part<br>
enzyme is added to 1999 parts reaction buffer (30 ÂµM CaCl2, 10 U/ml of calmodulin<br>
(Sigma P2277), l0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, l0mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% NaN3) to<br>
yield a final concentration of 1.25mU/ml.   99 ul of diluted enzyme solution is added<br>
into each well in a flat bottom 96-well polystyrene plate to which 1 ul of test<br>
compound dissolved in 100% DMSO is added. The compounds are mixed and pre-<br>
incubated with the enzyme for 10 min at room temperature.<br>
[0117]	The FL-GMP conversion reaction is initiated by combining 4 parts<br>
enzyme and inhibitor mix with 1 part substrate solution (0.225 ÂµM) in a 384-well microtiter plate. The reaction is incubated in dark at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction is halted by addition of 60 Âµl of binding reagent (1:400 dilution of IMAP beads in binding buffer supplemented with 1:1800 dilution of antifoam) to each well of the 384-well plate. The plate is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to allow IMAP binding to proceed to completion, and then placed in an Envision multimode<br>
microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT) to measure the fluorescence polarization<br>
(Amp).<br>
[0118]	A decrease in GMP concentration, measured as decreased Amp, is<br>
indicative of inhibition of PDE activity. ICso values are determined by measuring<br>
enzyme activity in the presence of 8 to 16 concentrations of compound ranging from<br>
0.0037 nM to 80,000 ÂµM and then plotting drug concentration versus AmP, which<br>
allows ICso values to be estimated using nonlinear regression software (XLFit; IDBS,<br>
Cambridge, MA).<br>
[0119]	The compounds of Examples 1-14 have ICso values of less than lÂµM in<br>
this assay, generally less than 10 ÂµM.<br>
