				<td>HUB DEVICE FOR DISC BRAKE, BRAKE DISC, AND VEHICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a hub device according to the introductory part of the attached claim 1.<br>
The invention also relates to a brake disc according to the introductory part of the attached claim 12.<br>
The invention also relates to a vehicle according to claim 15.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
During braking, a disc brake disc becomes very warm. This results in heat being given off from the disc to the surroundings by convection, conduction and radiation, but in normal operating conditions there is a predominance of conduction, i.e. heat being conducted away from the brake disc. Since the brake disc is fixed in the wheel hub, the latter has to be so configured that its seals and bearings are not subject to high temperatures due to said conduction, which is not normally a problem in the case of a traditional hub and a traditional brake disc, in which the neck of the disc is firmly screwed centrally to the hub.<br>
A so-called splined disc, i.e. a brake disc with no neck, however, is fastened close to an end of the hub by splines of the hub. The result is an unfavourable temperature distribution in the hub, causing raised bearing temperatures. This is of course undesirable and affects bearing service life etc.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a hub device, in which bearings and seals do not become warm to an extent as in the state of the art, resulting in a more favourable stress distribution in the hub and better cooling of the hub and hence a solution to the problems described above. Another object is that the hub device be capable of being cast integrally and therefore at relatively low cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object as above is achieved with a device and a brake disc with features according to the independent claims 1 and 12 respectively and a vehicle according to claim 15.<br>
Further advantages are achieved by what is specified in the dependent claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will be better understood with reference to the following detailed description read together with the attached drawings, in which the same notations refer to the same parts throughout the various views etc. and in which<br>
-	Fig. 1 depicts schematically a first embodiment of a hub device according to the invention as seen in its axial direction and in the direction in which the brake disc is intended to be applied,<br>
-	Fig.2 depicts a section A-A according to Fig. 1, with the brake disc represented by broken lines.<br>
-	Fig. 3 depicts schematically the hub device according to Fig. 1 in a relief view,<br>
-	Fig. 4 depicts schematically in a perspective view the hub device according to Fig. 1 with a brake disc and assembly fittings before assembly.<br>
-	Fig. 5 depicts schematically the hub device, the brake disc and the fittings according to Fig. 4 in a relief view and<br>
-	Fig. 6 depicts schematically a second embodiment of a hub device according to the invention as seen in an only partly depicted axial section.<br>
In Fig. 1, ref. 1 denotes a hub device for a brake disc 2 (see Figs. 2 and 4) for a disc brake, which brake disc comprises two opposite wearing layers 3,3' on which undepicted brake blocks are intended to act retardingly and which have between them a ventilation space 4.<br>
The hub device comprises at its one end 5 a fastening portion 6 by which it is adapted to being fastened to an undepicted vehicle wheel. Ref. 7 denotes a number of ridges (splines) adapted to holding the brake disc in the circumferential direction of the hub device, the brake disc being provided with a central hole 2' with grooves 2" running axially for cooperation with the ridges.<br>
Each ridge 7 has a portion 8 which protrudes freely away from the fastening portion, resulting in a gap 9 between said protruding portions and the outer shell surface 10 of the end 11 (which points away from the fastening portion) of a bearing socket 12 (which is supported by the fastening portion) of the hub device, which protruding portions 8 are adapted to supporting a brake* disc 2.<br>
Each protruding portion has a substantially rectangular cross-section transverse to the axial direction of the hub device, with two mutually substantially parallel opposite side surfaces 13 running axially and substantially radially and two opposite side surfaces 14 running axially and in the circumferential direction, while the brake disc has corresponding grooves and can be applied axially to the ridges of the hub device.<br>
It is preferable that the ridges are relatively few in number, e.g. five. According to the embodiment depicted, the freely protruding portion of each ridge is supported by a<br>
carrier portion 15 ranning towards and up to the fastening portion, which carrier portions run axially to the fastening portion at substantial mutual spacing in the circumferential direction and preferably ioin together with adjacent carrier portions at the fastening portion.<br>
The carrier portions are so arranged that each of them protrudes in the radial direction from the bearing socket and has a radial thickness which is reduced by an internal recess 15' (see Fig. 2) and which conesponds to the radial thickness of the protruding portion.<br>
It is preferred that the width in the circumferential direction of the carrier portions at the transition 16 to the protruding portions (see Fig. 4) exceeds the width of the protruding portions in the circumferential direction, thereby providing the carrier portions with end stops 16' for the brake disc. The width of the carrier portions preferably increases gradually towards the fastening portion, in principle from said transition.<br>
According to the embodiment depicted (see Fig. 2) the bearing socket 12 has at least one internal bearing seat 17 within said ridges as seen in the axial direction of the hub device. It is preferred that the bearing socket has two internal seats 17, with bearings preferably in the form of taper roller bearings. The hub device is supported via the bearing/bearings on an undepicted wheel shaft The bearing seat/seats has/have preferably substantially the same axial position as the protruding portions of the ridges. In addition to the portion with bearing seats, the bearing socket also has a portion connected to the fastening portion, thereby inter alia helping to support the carrier portions 15.<br>
According to preferred embodiments, the hub device is cast integrally with the fastening portion, the bearing socket, the ridges and the carrier portions and is preferably made of cast iron.<br>
Also according to preferred embodiments, the protruding portions 8 do not extend as far as the free end 18 of the bearing socket and they support the brake disc close to the free ends 19 of the respective portions 8. Embodiments are also preferred in which a wearing layer 3', viz. that further away from the fastening portion, is situated at least partly beyond the free ends of the protruding portions of the ridges (Fig. 2).<br>
The brake disc according to the invention is adapted to the hub device in such a way that the number of grooves 2" corresponds to the number of ridges, i.e. five in the case depicted.<br>
It is preferred that said grooves 2" are arranged in an internal flange 20 which runs in the circumferential direction of the brake disc (see Fig. 4) and has two opposite side surfaces 21 which in the axial direction are within the plane of the wearing surface 22 of the respective wearing layers 3,3'. The result is that one side surface 21 of the flange 20 serves in the assembled state as an abutment surface against the endstop 16' of the respective carrier portion.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, an assembly fitting (see Fig. 4) in the form of a stop bracket 23 is adapted to being fastened by a fastening element 24, e.g. a screw, in the end surface 19' of the free end of the respective protruding portion, as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. The respective fastening bracket is adapted to having a tongue 23' protruding along each of the mutually substantially parallel side surfaces 13 (which run axially and substantially radially) of the respective protruding portion in the groove 2" which during assembly accommodates the protruding portion. The fastening bracket is preferably made of stainless steel.<br>
The embodiment in Figs. 1-5 is primarily intended for the front wheel disc brakes of a truck. Fig. 6 depicts another embodiment of a hub device primarily intended for the rear wheel disc brakes of a truck. In this case the fastening portion 6 is arranged centrally on the bearing socket 12, which comprises two internal bearing seats 17, a first of which is situated substantially within said ridges as seen in the axial direction of the hub device and the second is situated on the opposite side of the fastening<br>
portion from the first, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Said protruding portions also end beyond the free end 18 of the bearing socket as seen in the axial direction and support the brake disc 2 close to the free ends 19 of the respective protruding portions. Ref. 19' denotes a seal which is not specifically depicted in the first embodiment.<br>
The function of the hub device is probably substantially and sufficiently indicated above.<br>
Friction heat imparted to the brake disc during braking is conducted from the brake disc to the ridges. The ridges being provided with the freely protruding portions leaving a gap between them and the bearing socket results in the heat not being conducted further radially to the bearing/bearings arranged in the bearing socket within the ridges, but axially to the carrier portions while at the same time the ridges are cooled in the gap. The extent of the carrier portions in the circumferential direction provides them with a large cooling surface. The small number of ridges results in a large temperature gradient and consequently more effective air-cooling of both the hub device and the disc. An embodiment in which a wearing layer is situated at least partly outside the ridges will reduce the heat conduction from the brake disc to the hub device and facilitate air-cooling of the brake disc. The configuration of the hub device also makes it very suitable for being cast integrally.<br>
The invention is described above in relation to preferred embodiments and embodiment examples.<br>
Further embodiments and also minor modifications and additions are of course conceivable without departing from the basic concept of the invention.<br>
Thus more or fewer than five ridges with freely protruding portions are conceivable, e.g. four or six.<br>
The hub device and the brake disc are primarily intended for heavy trucks but may of course be used for other kinds of vehicles.<br>
