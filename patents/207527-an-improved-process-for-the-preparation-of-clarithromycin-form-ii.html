The present invention relates to an improved, high yielding and cost effective process for the preparation of clarithromycin, without the involvement of any oxime based synthesis.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
The general methods of preparing clarithromycin, processes as per scheme lin fig 1, involves:<br>
1.	Protecting the hydroxy group at the T position and methyl group of the dimethyl amino group at the 3' position in Erythromycin- A with suitable protective group.<br>
2.	Introducing suitable side chains in the 9-carbonyI Group of Erythromycin A. Protecting the 4"-Hydroxy of Erythromycin A with suitable protective group.<br>
3.	Methylating the 11-hydroxy of the protected Erythromycin-A with suitable methylating agent.<br>
4.	Deprotecting the 6-O-methyl Erythromycin -A derivative in multiple step to obtain<br>
6-O-methyl Erythromycin -A.<br>
5.	Conversion of 6-O-Methyl Erythromycin-A to the desired Polymorph.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US 4,331,803 describes a process for making clarithromycin from Erythromycin-A by converting erythromycin A to its 2\ 3'-bis-benzyloxycarbonyl derivative followed by methylation using methyl iodide in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal hydride, butyl lithium/diisopropyl or sodium/potassium amide. The methylation reaction is carried out using 5-10 moles of methyl iodide and 1-2 moles of 2\ 3"-bis-benzyloxycarbonyl derivative at temperatures ranging from -78°C to room temperature preferably from -15°C to 5°C. The solvents used include polar aprotic solvents such as N,N-Dimethylformamide, N,N-Dimethylacetamide, Dimethylsulfoxide or their mixture with THF. Purification of the methylated product is carried out by using column chromatography, removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting groups by hydrogenolysis<br><br>
and remethylation of the 3'-N by reductive formylation. The yield of clarithromycin is about 6%.<br>
E.H. Flynn et al. in Journal of the American Chemical Society, 77,3104 (1955), describe a method for preparation of 2', 3'-bis-benzyloxycarbonyl Erythromycin derivatives, removal of the Benzyloxycarbonyl group by hydrogenolysis and reductive methylation with excess amount of formaldehyde.<br>
US 4,672,109 describes a modification of this process in which the 9-carbonyl group of 2\ 3*-bis-benyloxycabonyl derivative is protected as an alkyl oxime prior to 6-methylation to increase the regioselectivity of the methylation in the 6 position. The modified process requires seven process steps, including chromatographic purification, and the yield is still relatively low, about 13%.<br>
Canadian patent CA 1,226,279 discloses a method for preparing 6-0-methyl-2,-0, N-bis (benzyloxycarbonyl)-N-demethylerythromycin A which comprises by methylating 2-0, N-bis (benzyloxycarbonyl)-N-demethylerythromycin A with a methylating agent in the presence of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in a polar aprotic solvent. The compound, 6-0-methyl-2*-0, N-bis (benzyloxycarbonyl)-N-dimethyl erythromycin A, produced in this manner is purified using column chromatography which is time consuming and laborious. The purified compound is subjected to catalytic reduction to eliminate benzyloxycarbonyl groups at the 2,-0- and N-positions. Subsequent to this, an aqueous formaldehyde solution is added to the mixture so that a further catalytic reduction takes place to effect N-methylation of the compound. As formamides are known to poison the Pd/C catalyst, the consumption of Pd/C is high, thereby increasing the cost of the process.<br>
US 4,680,386 also discloses a modification of the process of the US 4,672,109 patent in which the 9-carbonyl group is protected as a benzylated oxime rather than an alkyl oxime.<br><br>
LIS 4, 670,549 is an improvement on the process of the '386 patent, in which the same alkylating reagent is used for alkylating the 9-oxime, 3'-amine and 2'-hydroxyl groups. The number of steps is reduced to five.<br>
EP 260,938 discloses a synthetic route in which the 2'and 4' hydroxyl group are silylated with trimethylsilyl chloride and trimethylsilyl imidazole after oximation and benzylation ;&gt;f the oxime OH, which also appears to increase the regioselectivity of the 6-OH nethylation.<br>
US 4,990,602 discloses a modification of the process of EP 260,938 utilizing specific sxime derivatives.<br>
US 4,610,910 describes silylated erythromycin A derivatives and procedures for making them. In only two of the silylated compounds described is the 9-carbonyl protected, 2'-9-i)is(O-trimethylsilyl) erythromycin A-9-Oxime and 2',4",9,11,12- pentakis(0-trimethyl silyl) erythromycin A-6, 9-hemiketal.<br>
PCT Publication No. WO 99/40097 describes a process for making clarithromycin and he products used in these processes; e.g., erythromycin A 9-alkylidenehydrazones, erythromycin A 9-alkyl-and 9-arylsulfonylhydrazones, erythromycin A 9- N-alkyl lydrazones and erythromycin A 9-N, N-dialkylahydrazones. Essentially clarithromycin is synthesized from erythromycin A by way of an alkylidenehydrazone or an irylsulfonylhydrazone. Regioselectivity of methylation is high and yields of the nethylation step are comparable of the best report oxime-based synthesis.<br>
3P 1,097,938 Al discloses a method of preparing pure Form II crystals of Clarithromycin comprising steps of: (a) treating Clarithromycin with Formic Acid in an Organic Solvent ;o give crystalline Clarithromycin format (b) neutralizing the clarithromycin formate with i base in a mixture of water and a water miscible organic solvent.<br>
2P 1,134,229 A2 discloses a method for preparing high purity clarithromycin of Form II crystals comprising the steps of: protection the 9-oxime hydroxyl group of erythromycin A 9-oxime or a salt thereof with a tropyl group and the T -and 4"-hydroxy groups with<br><br>
trimethylsilyl groups; reacting 2' -4"-0-bis (trimethylsilyl) erythromycin A 9-0-tropyloxime with a methylation agent; removing the protective groups and the oxime group of 2'-4"-Obis (trimethylsilyl)-6-0-methyl) erythromycin A 9-O-tropyloxime to obtain crude clarithromycin; treating the crude clarithromycin with methanesulfoinc acid in a mixture of a water-miscible organic solvent and water to obtain crystalline clarithromycin mesylate trihydrate; and neutralizing the crystalline clarithromycin mesylate trihydrate with aqueous ammonia in a mixture of a water-miscible organic solvent and water without the involvement of oxime based synthesis.<br>
US 5,858,986 describe the crystal Form-I of clarithromycin and a process for its preparation.<br>
US 5,945,405 describe the novel Form-0 solvate of clarithromycin and a process for its preparation.<br>
US 5,844,105 describes a process for the preparation of clarithromycin Form-II comprising converting erythromycin A to 6-O-methyl erythromycin A and treating the 6-O-methyl erythromycin A with a number of common organic solvents or a mixtures of common organic solvents. Further, these patents also describe the heating of Form-0 or I of clarithromycin at a temperature ranging from 70° C to 110°C for a prolonged period to prepare Form-II crystals.<br>
There is long felt need in the industry to develop cost effective, efficient and commercially viable process by the non-oxime route for the preparation of clarithromycin.<br>

The present invention has the following advantages over prior art:<br>
1.	Meets the long felt need of the industry to develop cost effective, efficient and commercially viable process by the non-oxime route for the preparation of clarithromycin.<br>
2.	The yield of the intermediate, 2'-3'-N-Bis (Benzyloxycarbonyl) N-Demethyl Erythromycin A, is enhanced to over 80% as against the reported yield of 55% in the prior art.<br>
3.	It avoids the use of unsafe solvents such as benzene, chloroform, ether etc.<br>
4.	The quality of benzylchloroformate used in the present invention is reduced significantly by 60% to 80%, as compared to the prior art.<br>
5.	The reaction temperature for the methylation step is carried out at temperature 1-15°C as compared to around -10 to -12°C as in the prior art.<br>
6.	The laborious chromatographic process forthe isql^^<br>
3'-N-Bis (Benzyloxycarbonyl) N-Demethyl Erythromycin A, is replaced by a simple work-up process using solvents such as methyl isobutyl ketone, acetone, methylene chloride etc. giving yields of around 80% as compared to around 41% in the prior art.<br>
7.	The use of Pd/C catalyst has dramatically been reduced by 50% in one of the process options viz. hydrogenolysis and reductive formylation carried out in two steps with Pd/C in the first step and sodium borohydride in the second step. It is now possible to recycle of Pd/C in this process option, thereby reducing the cost substantially.<br>
8.	The reaction time has been significantly reduced in hydrogenolysis compared to prior art.<br><br>
9.	The process offers the option for the formation of the salts such as the oxalate, citrate, maleate, fumarate etc at the last stage of the process to enable a direct conversion to Clarithromycin Form-II. This is superior compared to prior art option of heating Form-0 or I of clarithromycin at a temperature ranging from 70 to 110°C for a prolonged period of time to prepare Form-II crystals, which has the problem of low productivity.<br>
10.	The invention offers a purer pharmaceutical grade of clarithromycin with high yields, by reducing the quantum of impurities in the methylation reaction and a work up procedure for isolation of major impurities.<br><br><br><br>
