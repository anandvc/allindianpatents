AN EXHAUST COOLING<br>
SYSTEM OF AN AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust cooling system<br>
of an amphibious vehicle.<br>
In the case of dedicated land vehicles and marine vessels<br>
known in the art, the apparatus and methods employed for cooling<br>
exhaust systems are well established.  In the case of a land<br>
vehicle, the exhaust system is typically slung below the floor<br>
panel of the vehicle such that it is exposed to ambient<br>
atmospheric air which pass'es over and cools external surfaces of<br>
the exhaust system.  The cooling effect achieved is of course<br>
variable but satisfactory, being largely dependent upon factors<br>
such as vehicle speed and atmospheric conditions.  In the case of<br>
marine vessels, it is usual to cool exhaust systems with water.<br>
This is normally achieved using the abundant resource of raw<br>
water outside the vessel which is drawn in and circulated around<br>
a water jacket enclosing the exhaust system and then exhausted<br>
back to the raw water source.  Such exhaust cooling systems are<br>
highly efficient when the marine vessel is on water, but do not<br>
function when on land where the raw water source is no longer<br>
available.  However, this is not particularly important for a<br>
marine vessel whose engine will only rarely be run on land, if at<br>
all (typically only for maintenance reasons where an artificial<br>
raw water source may be provided, e.g. via a hosepipe).<br>
It is also known from US 3,884,194 of Citroen to provide a<br>
water jacket for an exhaust manifold of an air cooled engine used<br>
in a land vehicle in order to recover heat energy.  In<br>
particular, US 3,884,194 discloses a steam generator used for<br>
heating the passenger compartment of vehicles equipped with air<br>
cooled engines.<br>
In US 4,991,546 of Sanshin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, there is<br>
disclosed a water jacket based cooling system for marine<br>
watercraft used to cool both the internal combustion engine and<br>
exhaust manifold.  The invention is concerned with preventing<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-     2   -<br>
condensation forming in the exhaust manifold as a result of the<br>
cooling process.  Raw water is used, this being sourced from<br>
outside the watercraft and is returned after circulation around<br>
the various water jackets of the system.  In one embodiment, a<br>
supplementary radiator is used, but only for the purpose of<br>
providing a sealed cooling jacket for the engine, exhaust<br>
manifold and a portion of an exhaust elbow so that a coolant<br>
other than pure water may be employed in a closed system and kept<br>
separate from the raw water.  Raw water is still required to be<br>
sourced, circulated and returned to the body of water outside of<br>
the watercraft.  As such, this system cannot be employed in a<br>
land vehicle.<br>
In the case of an amphibious vehicle, however, the problems<br>
of cooling of an exhaust system present quite unique problems and<br>
considerations.  An amphibious vehicle is used extensively on<br>
land and on water and its exhaust system is liable to run at<br>
least as hot as that of any other road vehicle.  Whereas land<br>
vehicles rely on the surrounding air to keep their exhaust<br>
systems cool, especially catalytic converters which have been<br>
known to run so hot (-900Â°C) as to ignite grass underneath parked<br>
vehicles, the underside of an amphibious vehicle is sealed to<br>
ensure buoyancy and hydrodynamic performance on water.  This<br>
compounds the problem of providing adequate cooling since sealing<br>
the exhaust system inside the hull actually serves to insulate it<br>
from external cooling influences.  Furthermore, it is desirable<br>
to seal in the exhaust system of an amphibious vehicle since<br>
there exists the potential for damaging thermal shock effects of<br>
quenching when a fully heated exhaust system which has been<br>
operating in land mode enters the water for the vehicle to<br>
operate in marine mode.  Also, the catalytic converter is a very<br>
sensitive item which must be maintained at its optimum operating<br>
temperature to prevent damage to the catalyst.  It is clear<br>
therefore that an amphibious vehicle presents conflicting<br>
requirements and dedicated prior art systems are poorly suited to<br>
the requirements of an amphibious vehicle.<br>
The present invention provides, in a first aspect, an<br><br>

-      3   -<br>
exhaust cooling system of an amphibious vehicle operable in land<br>
and marine modes, the exhaust cooling system comprising:<br>
an exhaust system to be cooled;<br>
at least one air-liquid heat exchanger; and<br>
a first coolant liquid in thermal communication with the<br>
exhaust system and the at least one air-liquid heat exchanger,<br>
wherein:<br>
when the amphibious vehicle is operated the first coolant<br>
liquid is heated by the exhaust system and cooled by the at least<br>
one air-liquid heat exchanger.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides an<br>
exhaust cooling system of an amphibious, vehicle operable in land<br>
and marine modes, the exhaust cooling system comprising:<br>
an exhaust system to be cooled;<br>
at least one liquid-liquid heat exchanger, and<br>
a first coolant liquid in thermal communication with the<br>
exhaust system and the at least one liquid-liquid heat exchanger,<br>
wherein:<br>
when the amphibious vehicle is operated the first coolant<br>
liquid is heated by the exhaust system and cooled by the at least<br>
one liquid-liquid heat exchanger.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described by way of example only with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-       4    -<br>
installed in a quad bike variant of amphibious vehicle; and<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic side elevation view of the<br>
amphibious vehicle of Figure 5.<br>
Referring first to Figures 1 and 2, there is illustrated a<br>
schematic view of a cooling system according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention installed in an amphibious<br>
vehicle 10.  A prime mover 40 provides power for propelling the<br>
amphibious vehicle 10 when operating in land and marine modes.<br>
In land mode, power is delivered to a land propulsion means such<br>
as, for example, road wheels 20.  In marine mode, power is<br>
delivered to a marine propulsion means such as, for example, a<br>
jet drive 30.  In this preferred embodiment, the prime mover 4 0<br>
is an internal combustion engine from which the products of<br>
combustion leave via an exhaust system 50.<br>
The exhaust system 50 comprises a catalytic converter 51<br>
and a silencer 52, each enclosed within a water jacket 53.  The<br>
water jacket 53 has a liquid inlet 54 at a first distal end of<br>
the exhaust system 50 and a liquid outlet 55 at a second proximal<br>
end.<br>
An air-water heat exchanger 60 in the form of a<br>
conventional radiator is provided and has a liquid inlet 61 and a<br>
liquid outlet 62.  An elongate conduit for coolant liquid<br>
connects liquid inlet 61 with liquid outlet 62 and is packaged in<br>
a serpentine, labyrinthine or other such tortuous form so as to<br>
maximise the length of flow path between liquid inlet 61 and<br>
liquid outlet 62.  This conduit is provided with a matrix of fins<br>
arranged in thermal contact on its outer surface such that a<br>
large surface area is presented to passing air to maximise the<br>
thermal pathway available and heat transfer possible between the<br>
cooling air passing through the matrix and the coolant liquid<br>
passing through the conduit<br>
A closed coolant liquid circuit 80 is formed by the series<br>
connection of the water jacket 53 of the exhaust system 50 and<br>
the air-water heat exchanger 60.<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-      5   -<br>
In operation, coolant liquid may be simply pumped around<br>
the closed coolant liquid circuit 80 or pumped under thermostatic<br>
and/or other control regimes as is well known in the art (e.g.<br>
under the control of an electronic control unit (ECU) dependent<br>
upon vehicle operating parameters),  When the amphibious vehicle<br>
is operated, coolant liquid at a first cooled temperature enters<br>
the exhaust system 50 via liquid inlet 54 and passes along the<br>
water jacket 53 containing the exhaust system 50, passing from<br>
the cooler end of the exhaust system 50 at the rear of the<br>
vehicle 10 to the hotter end near the exhaust manifold(s) (so as<br>
to avoid quenching of the exhaust system and to prevent the<br>
formation of condensation in the exhaust manifold following a<br>
cold start).  The heat present in the exhaust system 50 is<br>
transferred to the coolant liquid via the established heat<br>
transfer pathway, heating the coolant liquid and cooling the<br>
exhaust system 50.  Coolant liquid at a second elevated<br>
temperature leaves the water jacket 53 via liquid exit 55.  The<br>
coolant liquid next passes' through a connecting conduit to the<br>
air-water heat exchanger 60, entering via liquid inlet 61.  As<br>
the coolant passes along the conduit within the heat exchanger<br>
60, air passing over the matrix of fins arranged in thermal<br>
contact with the conduit draws heat from the coolant liquid at<br>
the second elevated temperature, thereby cooling the coolant<br>
liquid to a temperature below the second elevated temperature.<br>
The passing of air over the matrix of fins may be free-flow (ram<br>
effect), via ducted means (to increase the ram effect) and/or may<br>
be forced or supplemented by way of means such as an auxiliary<br>
fan (not shown).  The coolant then leaves the heat exchanger 60<br>
via liquid exit 62 and a conduit conveys the coolant liquid to<br>
the liquid inlet 54 of the exhaust system and the above process<br>
is repeated, with the coolant liquid being re-circulated.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4, a schematic view of cooling system<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention is<br>
illustrated.  This second embodiment differs from the first only<br>
in that a water-water heat exchanger 70 is provided in addition<br>
to the air-water heat exchanger 60.  The water-water heat<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-     6   -<br>
exchanger has two liquid inlets 71, 73 and two liquid outlets 72,<br>
74 and is located between the air-liquid heat exchanger GO and<br>
the water jacket 53 of the exhaust system 50 (although it could<br>
be located at any position in the circuit).  A first conduit for<br>
coolant liquid connects liquid inlet 71 with liquid outlet 72 and<br>
is packaged in a serpentine, labyrinthine or other such tortuous<br>
form, again so as to maximise the length of flow path between<br>
liquid inlet 71 and liquid outlet 72.  A second conduit for raw<br>
water connects liquid inlet 73 with liquid outlet 74 and is<br>
likewise packaged in a serpentine, labyrinthine or other such<br>
tortuous form so as to maximise the length of flow path between<br>
liquid inlet 73 and liquid outlet 74.  These conduits are<br>
arranged relative to one another so as to maximise the thermal<br>
pathway available between the two conduits and heat transfer<br>
possible between the cooling raw water passing through the second<br>
conduit and the coolant liquid passing through the first conduit.<br>
A closed coolant liquid circuit 80 is formed by the series<br>
connection of the water jacket S3 of the exhaust system 50, the<br>
air-water heat exchanger 60 and the first conduit of the water-<br>
water heat exchanger 70 using appropriate liquid conduits.  An<br>
open raw water circuit 90 is formed using appropriate liquid<br>
conduits and in marine mode rav; water enters or is pumped from<br>
outside the amphibious vehicle 10, via a screen or filter (not<br>
shown), through the second conduit of the water-water heat<br>
exchanger 70, and back out into the external water source.  The<br>
raw water may be sourced, for example, from the pressurised side<br>
of the jet drive 30 to avoid the need for a separate pump.<br>
When the amphibious vehicle 10 is operated, the process as<br>
described in the first embodiment above is identical except that<br>
the cooling step provided by the air-water heat exchanger 60 is<br>
either supplemented or replaced with a cooling step effected as<br>
the coolant liquid passes through the water-water heat exchanger<br>
70.  Coolant liquid enters the water-water heat exchanger 70<br>
either at an elevated temperature as compared to the first cooled<br>
temperature (in the case that the air-water heat exchanger 60 is<br>
effective to one degree or other) or at the second elevated<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
7   -<br>
temperature (in the case that the air-water heat exchanger 60 is<br>
not effective) and passes along the first conduit within the heat<br>
exchanger 70.  At the same time, raw water at external ambient<br>
water temperature is pumped in from outside the amphibious<br>
vehicle 10 (or from an onboard store) via raw water liquid inlet<br>
73.  This raw water passes through the second conduit within the<br>
water-water heat exchanger 7 0 and leaves via raw water liquid<br>
exit 74 and is discharged back into the outside body of water (or<br>
back to the onboard store).  The arrangement of the first and<br>
second conduits (reverse flow with respect to one another)<br>
maximises the thermal pathway available between the two conduits<br>
and the resultant heat transfer possible, such that the coolant<br>
liquid is coded as the raw water is heated to an extent where<br>
the coolant liquid leaves via liquid exit 72 at a temperature<br>
below the second elevated temperature.  The coolant liquid is<br>
then re-circulated.<br>
It will be appreciated that the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention described above are just examples of many<br>
different layouts possible in accordance with the present<br>
invention.  In particular, the preferred embodiments described<br>
adopts a layout suitable f_or a mid-engined sports car version of<br>
amphibious vehicle 10.  In this version of amphibious vehicle 10,<br>
it is preferable to have the exhaust cooling system according to<br>
the present invention packaged as illustrated.  However, the<br>
exhaust cooling system according to the present invention is very<br>
flexible and adaptable for packaging in very different types of<br>
amphibious vehicle such as, for example, a tri'ke, a quad-bike, or<br>
an off-road utility vehicle.<br>
To exemplify this, Figures 5 and 6 illustrate a schematic<br>
view of a cooling system according to a third embodiment of the<br>
present invention installed in an amphibious vehicle 110 of quad-<br>
bike form.  This is a 'sit astride1 vehicle with a front seat 113<br>
and a rear seat 116 arranged in tandem-  As in the first<br>
embodiment described above, a prime mover 14 0 provides power for<br>
propelling the amphibious vehicle 110 when operating in land and<br>
marine modes.  In land mode, power is delivered to a land<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-      8   -<br>
propulsion means such as, for example, road wheels 120.  In<br>
marine mode, power is delivered to a marine propulsion means such<br>
as, for example, a jet drive 130.  In this preferred embodiment,<br>
the prime mover 140 is an internal combustion engine from which<br>
the products of combustion leave via an exhaust system 150.  The<br>
exhaust system 150 comprises a catalytic converter 151 and a<br>
silencer 152, each enclosed within a water jacket 153.  The water<br>
jacket 153 has a liquid inlet 154 at a first distal end of the<br>
exhaust system 150 and a liquid cutlet 155 at a second proximal<br>
end .<br>
Two air-water heat exchangers 160, 165 in the form of<br>
conventional radiators (different sizes for packaging reasons)<br>
are provided and have respective liquid inlets 161, 16S and<br>
liquid outlets 162, 167.  Elongate conduits for coolant liquid<br>
connect respective liquid inlets 161, 166 with respective liquid<br>
outlets 162, 167 and are each packaged in a serpentine,<br>
labyrinthine or other such tortuous form so as to maximise the<br>
length of flow path between liquid inlets 161, 166 and liquid<br>
outlets 162, 167.  These conduits are provided with a matrix of<br>
fins arranged in thermal contact on their outer surfaces such<br>
that a large surface area is presented to passing air to maximise<br>
the thermal pathway available and heat transfer possible between<br>
the cooling air passing through the matrices and the coolant<br>
liquid passing through the conduits.  These two air-water heat<br>
exchangers 160, 165 are connected in parallel in the Figures, but<br>
it will be appreciated that alternatively they may be connected<br>
in series.<br>
Optionally, a water-water heat exchanger 17 0 may be<br>
provided and, as shown, has two liquid inlets 171, 173 and two<br>
liquid outlets 172, 174.  A first conduit for coolant liquid<br>
connects liquid inlet 171 with liquid outlet 172 and is packaged<br>
in a serpentine, labyrinthine or other such tortuous form again<br>
so as to maximise the length of flow path between liquid inlet<br>
171 and liquid outlet 172.  A second conduit for raw water<br>
connects liquid inlet 172 with liquid outlet 174 and is likewise<br>
packaged in a serpentine, labyrinthine or other such tortuous<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-      9   -<br>
form so as to maximise the length of flow path between liquid<br>
inlet 172 and liquid outlet 174. These conduits are arranged<br>
relative to one another so as to maximise the thermal pathway<br>
available between the two conduits and heat transfer possible<br>
between the cooling raw water passing through the second conduit<br>
and the coolant liquid passing through the first conduit.<br>
A closed coolant liquid circuit 180 is formed by the series<br>
connection of the water jacket 153 of the exhaust system 150, the<br>
air-water heat exchangers 160, 165 and, if provided, the first<br>
conduit of the water-water heat exchanger 70 using appropriate<br>
liquid conduits.  In the embodiment illustrated, the air-water<br>
heat exchangers 160, 165 are themselves connected in parallel to<br>
one another, but alternatively could be connected in series.  An<br>
open raw water circuit 190 is formed using appropriate liquid<br>
conduits and in marine mode raw water is pumped from outside the<br>
amphibious vehicle 110, via a screen or filter (not shown),<br>
through the second conduit of the water-water heat exchanger 17 0,<br>
and back out into the external water source.<br>
Operation of the exhaust cooling system is as described<br>
above for the first and second embodiments, save for the coolant<br>
liquid passing through the two air-water heat exchangers 160, 165<br>
in parallel.<br>
In all embodiments described above, a closure means, e.g.<br>
hinged or sliding flaps, may be provided to protect the air-<br>
liquid heat exchanger(s) from water, wave strikes, and flotsam<br>
and jetsam encountered when operating the amphibious vehicle.<br>
The closure means can provide selective or total shielding of the<br>
air-liquid heat exchanger(s), and this may be controlled<br>
automatically (e.g. by ECU) or manually as operating conditions<br>
necessitate.  The closure means may be used to protect the heat<br>
exchanger(s) from damage and/or to control or optimise the<br>
cooling regime.<br>
It will be appreciated that whilst in the preferred<br>
embodiment described, the component parts and coolant flow paths<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-     10   -<br>
are arranged in particular layouts, many different layouts are<br>
possible.  For example, in an alternative embodiment, the present<br>
invention may make use of an air-water heat exchanger already<br>
present for cooling of an engine.  Alternatively, the air-water<br>
heat exchanger as described in the preferred embodiment may be<br>
provided in addition to the air-water heat exchanger provided for<br>
an engine.  Indeed, a plurality of air-water heat exchangers<br>
(e.g. smaller units) may be provided for packaging or other<br>
reasons and distributed around the vehicle.  Likewise, where<br>
included, a plurality of water-water heat exchangers may be<br>
provided and distributed accordingly.  Alternatively, the air-<br>
water heat exchanger(s) may be replaced by one or more water-<br>
water heat exchanger(s).  Whilst the component parts of the<br>
circuit shown in the preferred embodiment are arranged in series<br>
with the coolant liquid being pumped around the circuit in<br>
series, it will be appreciated that component parts may be<br>
arranged in parallel in addition to or in place of the existing<br>
arrangement.  Furthermore, each heat exchanger (whether of the<br>
air-water or water-water type) may be provided in a separate<br>
circuit having its own or shared coolant liquid.  In such a case,<br>
each circuit may be provided with its own separate water jacket,<br>
have access to a portion or sub-circuit within a common water<br>
jacket, or have access to a single common water jacket under the<br>
control of a flow control system.  Also, it is of course possible<br>
to introduce control valves for controlling the flow of coolant<br>
liquid in any one or more of the circuits provided and this may<br>
be managed by electrically operated or thermostatically<br>
controlled flow valves and associated electronic<br>
processing/control means, such as, for example an electronic<br>
control unit (ECU) provided as part of or in addition to an<br>
already existing ECU of the amphibious vehicle 10.  This provides<br>
the facility to switch individual components in and out of the or<br>
each circuit as necessary to optimise performance of the system.<br>
Optionally, by-pass conduits may be provided for each component.<br>
Whilst the air-water and water-water heat exchangers 60,<br>
160, 165 and 70, 170 described above are of conventional design,<br>
it will be appreciated that alternative or bespoke designs may be<br>
beneficially employed.  For example, the applicant has designed a<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-     11   -<br>
bespoke water-water heat exchanger which is incorporated in the<br>
hull of one of its amphibious vehicle designs.  The amphibious<br>
vehicle in question comprises a hull formed from aluminium, a<br>
good thermal conductor.  A longitudinal section of the hull is<br>
closed off to form a closed volume, the hull forming one side of<br>
this closed volume.  Coolant liquid may be pumped through the<br>
closed volume and when the amphibious vehicle is operating in the<br>
marine mode the coolant liquid is cooled by external raw water<br>
which is in direct contact with the hull surface.  This design<br>
does away with the need to source raw water from outside of the<br>
vehicle, and thus there is no need for the raw water circuit 90<br>
in the preferred embodiment described above.  This design of<br>
water-water heat exchanger has proved so effective that the rate<br>
of flow of coolant liquid through the closed volume has had to be<br>
metered to keep the engine at an efficient working temperature.<br>
It may therefore be preferred to fit a bypass circuit to the<br>
water-water heat exchanger to allow it to be switched out, for<br>
example while the engine is warming up. Such a bypass could be<br>
controlled manually, thermostatically, by a timer switch, or by<br>
any other suitable control means (e.g. an ECU).  Alternatively or<br>
additionally to the above, a water-water heat exchanger may be<br>
embodied in an existing apparatus of the vehicle, such as the jet<br>
drive 30, for example.  Cooling liquid may be circulated within<br>
or around components of the jet drive 30 and/or tines within a<br>
stone guard for the jet drive 30.  Large volumes of raw water at<br>
ambient temperature pass these components which are manufactured<br>
from metals which are good thermal conductors.  Furthermore,<br>
additional cooling may be provided by injecting raw water<br>
directly into the exhaust 'stream of exhaust gas passing through<br>
and out of the exhaust system.<br>
It will be appreciated that whilst in the preferred<br>
embodiments described above the prime mover 40, 140 takes the<br>
form of an internal combustion engine, the prime mover 40, 140<br>
could alternatively take the form of a fuel cell, a hybrid<br>
engine, a turbine engine or any combination thereof.<br>
Furthermore, whilst the cooling system is presented as one for<br>
cooling an exhaust system, it could also be employed to cool<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-      12   -<br>
other heat generating sources such as, for example, the marine<br>
propulsion means 30, 13 0, the prime mover 40, 14 0 and/or braking<br>
components.<br>
Furthermore, the prime mover 40, 14 0 may be mounted<br>
transversely as shown in Figures 1 and 2 and as described in the<br>
applicant's co-pending application published as WO 02/07999,- or<br>
longitudinally, as is found convenient.  An example of a power<br>
train comprising a longitudinally mounted prime mover may be<br>
found in the applicant's co-pending application published as WO<br>
02/12005.<br>
As described above, the coolant liquid circulates around<br>
the closed circuit 80, 180 whilst the raw water is pumped in and<br>
out of the open circuit 90, 190 when available (i.e. in the<br>
marine mode).  Because the coolant liquid is separated from the<br>
-raw water and retained always in the closed circuit 80, 180,<br>
antifreeze and its associated corrosion inhibitors may be used in<br>
the coolant liquid to protect the system components against low<br>
temperature and corrosive effects.  For environmental reasons,<br>
this would not be possible in the case of known marine vessel<br>
exhaust cooling systems which pump all of the coolant back into<br>
the rav; v/ater source.  However, if it is desired to provide<br>
additional cooling when operating the vehicle 10, 110 in land<br>
mode, the system may be arranged to retain raw water in the open<br>
circuit 90, 190 and/or closed circuit 80, 180 when the vehicle is<br>
driven on land.  Such a system may have added benefits in terms<br>
of providing ballast which can be controllably distributed around<br>
the vehicle to further optimise performance, for example.  In<br>
this case, safety devices could be provided to protect the system<br>
against frost damage in case raw water is accidentally retained<br>
during cold atmospheric conditions.  For example, bursting discs<br>
could be provided to relieve excess pressure as is known in the<br>
design and operation of chemical process plants.<br>
It will be appreciated that the closed circuit 80, 180 need<br>
not necessarily be a closed circuit in the case where antifreeze<br>
and its associated corrosion inhibitors are not required to be<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-     13   -<br>
present in the coolant liquid.  In such a case raw water may<br>
instead be drawn in, circulated around the so-called closed<br>
circuit 80, ISO and either retained for further circulation or<br>
dispensed back into the raw water source.  In the case where raw<br>
water is retained for further circulation (for land mode<br>
operation of the vehicle, for example) bursting discs or other<br>
sacrificial elements may be employed in the closed circuit for<br>
safety reasons as described above.  In a yet further embodiment,<br>
preferably when the vehicle is operating in the marine mode, raw<br>
water may be drawn in and passed directly through the water<br>
jacket 53, 153 of the exhaust system 50, 150 only before being<br>
dispensed back into the raw water source.  This provides cooling<br>
of the exhaust system 50, 150 without the need for circulation of<br>
coolant liquid around the remainder of the closed circuit 80,<br>
180.  Such an arrangement may be achieved using flow control<br>
valves, for example.<br>
Whilst in the preferred embodiments described above cooling<br>
of the exhaust system 50, 150 is achieved using a coolant liquid<br>
which is passed through a water jacket 53, 153 directly enclosing<br>
components of the exhaust system 50, 150, it will be appreciated<br>
that the apparatus employed to effect this heat transfer and<br>
control thereof may take any suitable form.  For example, the<br>
water jacket 53, 153 need not enclose all components of the<br>
exhaust system.  Instead, only a selected component or selection<br>
of components may be enclosed.  Indeed, a plurality of separate<br>
water jackets may be beneficially employed, each separately<br>
enclosing one or more components.  Each water jacket may be<br>
selectively 'plumbed' in and out of a circuit using control<br>
valves or other flow control means.  Furthermore, the or each<br>
water jacket may be thermally insulated to one degree or other<br>
from components of the exhaust system and/or designed so as to<br>
prevent coolant liquid coming into direct contact with them.<br>
This may be achieved, for example, by providing an air, gas or<br>
liquid filled gap directly between the water jacket and an<br>
exhaust component (e.g. using ribs, fins or other structural<br>
members to achieve a fixed (linear or graduated) spatial<br>
relationship therebetween).  Such an air, gas or liquid filled<br><br>
WO 2006/056805	PCT/GB2005/004571<br>
-      14   -<br>
gap may additionally or alternatively be partially or completely<br>
filled or lagged with an insulating material.  Each of these<br>
alternatives may be employed separately or in combination to<br>
optimise the exhaust cooling regime of the vehicle.  It will be<br>
appreciated also that control of the flow of coolant liquid is<br>
imperative in optimising the cooling regime and in particular for<br>
optimal cooling of each separate component in the exhaust system<br>
during different modes such as land mode, marine mode, vehicle<br>
start up, normal running and vehicle shut down.  The. catalytic<br>
converter is one such component for which optimal operating<br>
parameters are critical.  It is also important to control cooling<br>
of exhaust manifolds to prevent condensation and sediment build<br>
up.  Furthermore, thermal shock effects on exhaust components<br>
must be taken into consideration.<br>
The exhaust cooling system according to the present<br>
invention may be particularly advantageously applied to a planing<br>
amphibious vehicle,- and further to such a vehicle having wheels<br>
which are retractable when the vehicle is driven over water in a<br>
marine mode.  Control aspects of the exhaust cooling system may<br>
be linked into a vehicle control system which offers a land mode<br>
and a distinct marine mode.  It may also be particularly<br>
advantageous for the exhaust cooling system according to the<br>
present invention to cool the engine exhaust manifolds in a<br>
controlled manner to prevent the formation of condensation in the<br>
exhaust manifold following a cold start.<br>
Whilst the heat exchangers described herein have been<br>
referred to as :air-water1 and 'water-water' heat exchangers, it<br>
will be appreciated that the term 'water' infers the use of any<br>
suitable liquid, e.g. water provided with antifreeze and<br>
associated corrosion inhibitors.<br><br>
