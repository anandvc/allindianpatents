				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
POLYGLYCEROL, FATTY ACID ESTER OF POLYGLYCEROL, AND PROCESSES FOR<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content, to a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content used as a<br>
raw material for the fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol, and to<br>
processes for producing the same. The fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content obtained by<br>
the present invention has high surface activity because of low content<br>
of a dehydrated cyclic structure, and it can be used as a food additive<br>
or a cosmetic, medical, or industrial surfactant for the purpose<br>
of emulsification, solubilization, dispersion, washing,<br>
anticorrosion, lubrication, static protection, wetting, and so on.<br>
Moreover, the polyglycerol itself can be used as humectants,<br>
thickeners, plasticizers, and for hydrophilic treatment, and so<br>
on.<br>
Background Art<br>
Examples of various compounds, conventionally known as<br>
emulsif iers or solubilizers include : ethylene oxide-based non-ionic<br>
surfactants such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, a polyoxyethylene<br>
polyhydric alcohol/fatty acid ester, and a polyoxyethylene alkyl<br>
phenyl ether; and food surfactants such as a sorbitan/fatty acid<br>
ester, a sucrose/fatty acid ester, and a fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol (including a polyglycerol ester of interesterified<br>
ricinoleic acid).<br>
Of those, the fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol is one of<br>
the most useful surfactants because the fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol ensures safety to a human body and to the environment,<br>
can have diverse compositions, and has high versatility. The fatty<br>
acid ester of a polyglycerol is produced by polymerizing glycerol<br>
as one of raw materials at high temperatures in the presence of<br>
an alkali catalyst such as caustic soda, deodorizing and decolorizing<br>
the resultant to obtain a polyglycerol reaction product, and<br>
subjecting the polyglycerol reaction product and a fatty acid as<br>
raw materials to an esterification reaction.<br>
Meanwhile, known processes for industrial production of a<br>
polyglycerol used as a raw material are as follows:<br>
(i) a process for producing a polyglycerol through recovery<br>
from a distillation residue of glycerol;<br>
(ii) aprocess for producing a polyglycerol through dehydration<br>
condensation of glycerol;<br>
(iii) a process for producing a polyglycerol through direct<br>
polymerization of epichlorohydrin, hydrolysis, and then<br>
dechlorination; and<br>
(iv) a process for producing a polyglycerol through addition<br>
of glycidol to glycerol or a polyglycerol in the presence of an<br>
alkali catalyst such as NaOH or amines, or an acidic catalyst such<br>
as acetic acid.<br>
However, analysis of a composition distribution of the<br>
polyglycerol reaction product obtained through each of the above<br>
processes by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as described<br>
below confirms that produced through intramolecular dehydration<br>
are not only cyclic low molecular compounds but also a polyglycerol<br>
having a cyclic structure in considerably high content with a<br>
molecular weight ranging from several hundreds to several thousands,<br>
which are formed through removal of one to several water molecule (s)<br>
from a polyglycerol molecule.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that a<br>
polyglycerol containing the above-described polyglycerol having<br>
a cyclic structure in high content has inhibited properties in<br>
hydrophilicity and the like . The inventors of the present invention<br>
have also found that deterioration of properties such as water<br>
solubility, surface activity, and the like is caused in a fatty<br>
acid ester of a polyglycerol obtained from the above-described<br>
polyglycerol and a fatty acid ester.<br>
As a polyglycerol produced through a reaction, a reaction<br>
product obtained by reacting glycerol with epichlorohydrin or<br>
glycidol, or by reacting glycerol or a polyglycerol with<br>
epichlorohydrin, monochlorohydrin, dichlorohydrin, or glycidol has<br>
been heretofore used as it is or used after having been optionally<br>
purified.<br>
Example of a purification process include: purification by<br>
heating under reduced pressure of several Torr in a stream of a<br>
gas such as nitrogen or water vapor for deodorization or removal<br>
of unreacted raw materials; purification by removing ionic<br>
components such as a catalyst used with an ion-exchange resin, an<br>
ion-exchange membrane, or the like; purification by removing color<br>
components or odor components using an absorbent such as active<br>
carbon; and purification by reduction treatment through<br>
hydrogenation or the like.<br>
However, in the purification processes for a polyglycerol<br>
reaction product, the composition distribution of the resulting<br>
a polyglycerol reaction product has not been discussed in detail.<br>
Regarding a polyglycerol reaction product obtained by polymerizing<br>
the most generally used glycerol at high temperatures in the presence<br>
of an alkali catalyst such as caustic soda, and deodorizing and<br>
decolorizing the resultant, cyclic compounds having a low molecular<br>
weight such as cyclic, diglycerol have been discussed extensively.<br>
However, actually, analysis on the composition distribution of a<br>
polyglycerol having a molecular weight in the range of several<br>
hundreds to several thousands has been hardly discussed in spite<br>
of a fact that a dehydration reaction is known to take place in<br>
a polyglycerol molecule.<br>
Commercially distributed a polyglycerol is called<br>
tetraglycerol, hexaglycerol, or decaglycerol according to an average<br>
polymerization degree calculated from a hydroxyl value. However,<br>
in fact, the polyglycerol is a mixture of various glycerol polymers<br>
each having a polymerization degree from 2 to 10 or more, and may<br>
include unreacted glycerol (polymerization degree of 1).<br>
It has been revealed that a polyglycerol of a relatively low<br>
molecular weight such as glycerol, diglycerol, or triglycerol may<br>
exist in high content in a polyglycerol containing such a mixture<br>
of various glycerols in order to adjust the average polymerization<br>
degree calculated from hydroxyl values to the same value.<br>
JP-B 5-1291 (claim 1, lines 12-22 in the 3rd column, and<br>
Examples) discloses slightly colored polyglycerol having a large<br>
polymerization degree obtained by: adding a phosphoric acid catalyst<br>
to glycerol or a polyglycerol; and subjecting the resultant to an<br>
addition reaction with glycidol at 115 to 125°C.<br>
JP-A7-216082 (claiml, paragraph 0008, and Examples) discloses<br>
a process for producing a polyglycerol in which glycerol is<br>
polycondensed in a boiling state of a reaction mixture at 200 to<br>
270°C in the presence of an alkali.<br>
JP-A 2002-30144 (claim 1, and Examples 1 to 12) discloses a<br>
process for producing a polyglycerol in which glycidol alone is<br>
added and allowed to react in the presence of an alkali metal halide<br>
without the use of glycerol as an initiator.<br>
Regarding a fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol, JP-A 7-308560<br>
[claim 1 and Comparative Example 1 (Production of a polyglycerol<br>
used in each Example)] discloses a process in which a polyglycerol<br>
obtained by distilling off low molecular weight polymers from a<br>
polyglycerol produced through polycondensation of glycerol at 240°C<br>
in the presence of sodium hydroxide is allowed to react with a fatty<br>
acid.<br>
Alternatively, JP-A 8-109153 (claim 1 and Examples) discloses<br>
a process for producing a fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol obtained<br>
through an addition polymerization reaction of glycidol with a fatty<br>
acid. However, a product obtained through this process is restricted<br>
to a polyglycerol/mono-fatty acid ester alone.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide : a polyglycerol<br>
significantly reduced in content of a polyglycerol having a cyclic<br>
structure formed through removal of a water molecule from a<br>
polyglycerol molecule and a production process thereof; and a fatty<br>
acid ester of a polyglycerol having excellent surface activity and<br>
a production process thereof.<br>
A polyglycerol has not been thoroughly studied so far because<br>
a polyglycerol has physical properties of high viscosity and high<br>
boiling point and thus because of difficulties in handling. In<br>
particular, significance of the presence of a polyglycerol having<br>
a cyclic structure in a polyglycerol reaction product and<br>
significance of its removal have not been recognized. However, the<br>
inventors of the present invention have realized that reduction<br>
in content of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure is necessary.<br>
Thus, the inventors of the present invention have devoted themselves<br>
to extensive studies and have found that glycidol and a catalyst<br>
are added dropwise for a reaction with glycerol as a starting material,<br>
to thereby give a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described indetail.<br>
I. A polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content<br>
A polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content of<br>
the present invention is composed of a polyglycerol (1) represented<br>
by the general formula [1] and a polyglycerol(2) having a cyclic<br>
structure containing at least one cyclic structure in a polyglycerol<br>
molecule.<br>
In the formula [1], "p" represents a repeating portion of a<br>
glycerol residue and is an integer of 0 or more, and the polyglycerol<br>
molecule has a polymerization degree of "p+2". Thus, the formula<br>
[1] represents diglycerol having a polymerization degree of 2 if<br>
"p" is 0, triglycerol having a polymerization degree of 3 if "p"<br>
is 1, or tetraglycerol having a polymerization degree of 4 if "p"<br>
is 2, for example.<br>
The cyclic structure portion in the polyglycerol (2) having<br>
a cyclic structure is formed through a dehydration reaction of any<br>
two hydroxyl groups of a glycerol residue in the polyglycerol (1) .<br>
The cyclic structure can include various structures depending on<br>
reaction conditions and so on, and is therefore not particularly<br>
limited. Examples of a cyclic structure formed under general<br>
reaction conditions include a 1,4-dioxahe structure (6-membered<br>
ring), a 1, 4-dioxepane structure (7-membered ring), and a<br>
1,5-dioxocane structure (8-membered ring).<br>
For example, in a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure<br>
represented by the following formula [2] , "p" represents a repeating<br>
portion of a glycerol residue and is an integer of 0 or more. The<br>
"q" represents a cyclic structure portion and is an integer of 1<br>
or more. The polyglycerol molecule has a polymerization degree of<br>
"p+2q+1". The cyclic structure portion(s) may be inserted between<br>
the glycerol residues randomly or continuously, into a chain, or<br>
at a terminal. Thus, the formula [2] is composed of 1 unit of<br>
dehydrated cyclic diglycerol and 1 unit of glycerol if "p" is 0<br>
and "q" is 1, or 2 units of glycerol and 1 unit of dehydrated cyclic<br>
diglycerol if "p" is 1 and "q" is 1, for example. Further, the formula<br>
[2] is composed of 3 units of glycerol and 1 unit of dehydrated<br>
cyclic diglycerol if "p" is 2 and "q" is 1, or 4 units of glycerol<br>
and 2 units of dehydrated cyclic diglycerol if "p" is 3 and "q"<br>
is 2, for example.<br>
A polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content of<br>
the present invention is characterized in that a ratio of [total<br>
polyglycerol (1)]: [total polyglycerol (2) having a cyclic structure<br>
containing at least one cyclic structure, preferably one or two<br>
of cyclic structure(s) in the polyglycerol molecule] is [70% or<br>
more] : [30% or less] (the total of both is 100 % by weight) , preferably<br>
[80% or more]:[20% or less] by liquid chromatography/mass<br>
spectrometry (abbreviated as LC/MS) described below.<br>
In a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content<br>
of the present invention, the total polyglycerol having one cyclic<br>
structure is 30% or less, preferably 20% or less with respect to<br>
the total polyglycerol (1) . The total polyglycerol having two cyclic<br>
structures is one third or less of the total polyglycerol having<br>
one cyclic structure, and the total polyglycerol having three cyclic<br>
structures is one fifth or less of the total polyglycerol having<br>
two cyclic structures. Thus, the polyglycerol having three cyclic<br>
structures, if any, is present in the polyglycerol in very low content.<br>
The polyglycerol (1) in the polyglycerol having a cyclic<br>
structure in low content of the present invention has an average<br>
polymerization degree (repeating unit of a glycerol residue) "n"<br>
of 2 or more, preferably 3 to 60, particularly preferably 3 to 50.<br>
In the polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content<br>
of the present invention, the ratio of a polyglycerol (2) having<br>
a cyclic structure tends to increase gradually with increasing<br>
average polymerization degree "n" of a polyglycerol (1) . If the<br>
average polymerization degree "n" of a polyglycerol (1) is from<br>
2 to 10, the ratio of [the total polyglycerol (l)]:[the total<br>
polyglycerol (2) having a cyclic structure] is [80% or more]: [20%<br>
or less], preferably [85% or more]:[15% or less], more preferably<br>
[90% or more]:[10% or less]. If the average polymerization degree<br>
"n" of a polyglycerol (1) is greater than 10, the ratio of [the<br>
total polyglycerol (1) ]: [the total polyglycerol (2) having a cyclic<br>
structure] is [70% or more]:[30% or less], preferably [75% or<br>
more]: [25% or less], more preferably [80% or more]: [20% or less] .<br>
Moreover, in a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low<br>
content of the present invention, the ratio of a component with<br>
a polymerization degree "n-1" to a polyglycerol showing the highest<br>
distribution rate (polymerization degree "n") in terms of an<br>
intensity ratio distribution determined by liquid<br>
chromatography/mass spectrometry, that is, (component with a<br>
polymerization degree "n-1")/(component with a polymerization<br>
degree "n") is 0.4 or more, and 0.5 or more and even 0.7 or more<br>
with increasing average polymerization degree "n" of a polyglycerol<br>
(1) .<br>
Furthermore, in a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in<br>
small amount obtained through a production process of the present<br>
invention, a fluctuation trend of ratio of (component with a<br>
polymerization degree "n-1")/(component with a polymerization<br>
degree "n") and of (component with a polymerization degree<br>
"n+1")/(component with a polymerization degree "n") in terms of<br>
intensity ratio determined by liquid chromatography/mass<br>
spectrometry corresponds to a distribution obtained through a<br>
successive reaction of glycidol using glycerol as an initiator.<br>
A polyglycerol having such a distribution easily improves solvency<br>
and acquires required HLB (hydrophilicity-lipophilicity balance) .<br>
A polyglycerol (1) may contain a low content of a branched<br>
structure having glycidol added to a secondary hydroxyl group.<br>
A reaction product contains approximately 1 to 15%, preferably<br>
10% or less of other compounds (e.g. , a polyglycerol having a double<br>
bond in the polyglycerol molecule) in addition to the above-described<br>
polyglycerol (1) and a polyglycerol (2) , andglycerol as a rawmaterial.<br>
The content of other compounds increases with increasing average<br>
polymerization degree of a polyglycerol (1).<br>
An LC/MS analysis system is composed of LC and MS portions,<br>
and an interface connecting them. The MS portion as a detection<br>
system operates on a principle common with that of a GC/MS analysis<br>
system, which employs a technique of detecting and identifying<br>
ionized target substances on the basis of a mass number/charge (m/z)<br>
ratio.<br>
Processes for obtaining information from MS connected to<br>
chromatography include a mass chromatogram showing a time<br>
distribution of an intensity of an arbitrary m/z, a mass spectrum<br>
showing a relative intensity distribution of each m/z at an arbitrary<br>
time, and a total ion chromatogram (TIC) showing a time change of<br>
total intensity, not of an intensity of individual m/z, obtained<br>
by adding intensities (quantities of electricity) of all ions. Of<br>
those processes, the total ion chromatogram is preferably used.<br>
Processes for obtaining the mass chromatogram include a<br>
scanning method for extracting a time distribution of required m/z<br>
intensity from intensity information in a time axis direction<br>
obtained through magnetic field scanning within a certain m/z range<br>
at a constant time interval, and a selected ion monitoring (SIM)<br>
method with high sensitivity for selectively detecting only an<br>
intensity of a target single m/z or intensities of a plurality of<br>
m/z's.<br>
Examples of a basic principle of a mass spectrometer in<br>
practical use include a magnetic sector type, a quadrupole type,<br>
an ion trap type, a flying time, and a Fourier transform type. Of<br>
those spectrometers, the ion trap type spectrometer is preferred.<br>
A polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content of<br>
the present invention is obtained by successively adding a catalyst<br>
and glycidol to a reactor charged with water or glycerol as an<br>
initiator for an addition polymerization reaction.<br>
The catalyst is preferably a phosphoric acid-based acidic<br>
catalyst. Examples of the above-described phosphoric acid-based<br>
acidic catalyst include phosphoric acids and phosphates. Specific<br>
examples thereof include: phosphoric acids such as phosphoric acid,<br>
phosphoric anhydride, polyphosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid,<br>
metaphosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, triphosphoric acid, and<br>
tetraphosphoric acid; and acidic phosphates such as methyl acid<br>
phosphate, ethyl acid phosphate, isopropyl acid phosphate, butyl<br>
acid phosphate, and 2-ethylhexyl acid phosphate. It is noted that<br>
those acidic phosphates can be used in any forms such as a monoester,<br>
a diester, and a mixture thereof. Of those, phosphoric acid and<br>
acidic phosphate are preferably used. One of the above-described<br>
catalysts may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used<br>
as a mixture.<br>
An addition amount of the catalyst is 0.001 to 1% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by weight with respect to a resulting<br>
polyglycerol. The addition amount of less than 0.001% by weight<br>
provides a small reaction rate. On the other hand, the addition<br>
amount of more than 1% by weight easily promotes hydrolysis in<br>
esterification with a fatty acid due to the remaining phosphoric<br>
acid. As a result, the addition amount of more than 1% by weight<br>
causes a deleterious effect on the performance of a product such<br>
as insufficient stability of an aqueous solution.<br>
Glycerol is placed in a reactor and 2 mole or more of glycidol<br>
and a catalyst are successively added to 1 mole of the glycerol<br>
for a reaction, to name one example of a reaction process.<br>
Alternatively, in the case of using water as an initiator,<br>
water is placed in a reactor and a reaction is carried out in the<br>
same manner as that described above.<br>
The catalyst and glycidol may be separately added dropwise<br>
(separately charged), or may be added dropwise in a mixed state.<br>
It is not preferred that the dropping of the catalyst be terminated<br>
too early compared with that of glycidol. Although the rate of<br>
dropping thereof is not particularly limited, it is preferred that<br>
the catalyst and glycidol be added dropwise at a uniform rate as<br>
a whole.<br>
A reaction temperature is in the range of 80°C to 130°C,<br>
preferably 85°C to 125°C, more preferably 90°C to 120°C. When the<br>
temperature is lower than 80°C, the reaction rate is small. When<br>
the temperature is higher than 130°C, intramolecular dehydration<br>
takes place easily, thereby increasing the content of a polyglycerol<br>
having a cyclic structure.<br>
Moreover, the reaction is desirably carried out under an inert<br>
gas atmosphere such as nitrogen gas, and may be optionally carried<br>
out under compressed or reduced pressure conditions. The reaction<br>
rate can be increased in a reaction under compressed conditions.<br>
A conversion of glycidol is 98% or more, preferably 99.5% or<br>
more, more preferably 99.9% or more.<br>
The obtained polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low<br>
content may be purified as required for use of a product. A<br>
purification process is not particularly limited, and any of<br>
processes known in the art may be employed. For example, a<br>
polyglycerol may be purified through an absorption treatment with<br>
active carbon, activated clay, or the like, a treatment under reduced<br>
pressure using water vapor, nitrogen, or the like as a carrier gas,<br>
washing with an acid or an alkali, or molecular distillation.<br>
Alternatively, unreacted polyglycerol and the like may be separated<br>
and removed through liquid-liquid distribution, or using an<br>
absorbent, a resin, a molecular sieve, a loose reverse osmosis<br>
membrane, an ultrafiltration membrane, or the like.<br>
Furthermore, lowmolecular weight substances such as unreacted<br>
glycerol and glycerol dimer in the above-described reaction product<br>
may be optionally removed through distillation or the like from<br>
a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content of the present<br>
invention.<br>
II. Fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure<br>
in low content<br>
A fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure<br>
in low content according to the present invention is a fatty acid<br>
ester of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content,<br>
which has an ester structure formed through dehydration of the<br>
above-described polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low<br>
content of the present invention and a fatty acid.<br>
Examples of a process for producing the fatty acid ester of<br>
a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content according<br>
to the present invention can include a process through dehydration<br>
esterification of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low<br>
content with a fatty acid, a process through removal of low molecular<br>
weight alcohol from an ester of a fatty acid with a low molecular<br>
weight alcohol and a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low<br>
content, a process through removal of a low molecular weight fatty<br>
acid from an ester of a low molecular weight fatty acid with a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content and a higher<br>
fatty acid, and a process through removal of an alkali halide from<br>
a fatty acid halide, a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in<br>
low content, and caustic alkali. Of those processes, there is<br>
economical the process through dehydration esterification of a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content with a fatty<br>
acid.<br>
In the process through dehydration esterif ication, for example,<br>
the dehydration esterification can be carried out under normal<br>
pressure or reduced pressure in the presence of an alkali catalyst<br>
or an acid catalyst, or in the absence of a catalyst. A polyglycerol<br>
having a cyclic structure in low content and a fatty acid must be<br>
added in an amount appropriately selected according to the purpose<br>
of a product. For example, in the case of intending to obtain a<br>
hydrophilic surfactant, a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure<br>
in low content and a fatty acid may be added in equimolar amounts<br>
by calculating weights thereof from a hydroxyl value (also referred<br>
to as an OH value) of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in<br>
low content and a molecular weight of a fatty acid. In the case<br>
of intending to obtain a lipophilic surfactant, mole number of the<br>
fatty acid may be increased.<br>
The obtained fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol having a cyclic<br>
structure in low content may be purified as required for use of<br>
a product. The purification process is not particularly limited,<br>
and any of processes known in the art may be employed. For example,<br>
the fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol may be purified through an<br>
absorption treatment with activated carbon, activated clay, or the<br>
like, a treatment under reduced pressure using water vapor, nitrogen,<br>
or the like as a carrier gas, washing with an acid or an alkali<br>
or molecular distillation. Alternatively, unreacted polyglycerol<br>
and the like may be separated and removed through liquid-liquid<br>
distribution, or using an absorbent, a resin, a molecular sieve,<br>
a loose reverse osmosis membrane, an ultrafiltration membrane, or<br>
the like.<br>
Additive<br>
An additive may be added to the fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol<br>
having a cyclic structure in low content of the present invention<br>
to allow easy handling of a product. Examples of the additive include<br>
ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerol, a polyglycerol, water, liquid<br>
sugar, and oils and fats for reducing a viscosity of a product.<br>
One additive or two or more additives may be added to dissolve or<br>
emulsify the fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol. Alternatively,<br>
polysaccharide such as lactose or dextrin, or a protein such as<br>
caseinate may be added to pulverize the fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol.<br>
Depending on the purpose for use, the fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content of the present<br>
invention may be mixed with other surfactants as additives to produce<br>
a product of a surfactant. Examples of the other surfactants that<br>
can be used include nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants,<br>
anionic surfactants, and cationic surfactants. Examples of the<br>
nonionic surfactants include: lecithin such as soybean lecithin,<br>
yolk lecithin, or rapeseed lecithin, or a partial hydrolysate<br>
thereof; monoglycerides such as monoglycerides of caprylic acid,<br>
capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic<br>
acid, behenic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, ricinoleic acid, and<br>
interesterified ricinoleic acid, a monoglyceride mixture thereof,<br>
or a monoglyceride of an organic acid which is an organic acid ester<br>
of the monoglyceride with an organic acid such as acetic acid, citric<br>
acid, succinic acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid; a fatty acid<br>
ester of sorbitan such as a sorbitan ester of caprylic acid, capric<br>
acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid,<br>
behenic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, ricinoleic acid, and<br>
interesterif ied ricinoleic acid; propylene glycol/fatty acid esters<br>
such as propylene glycols of caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric<br>
acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid,<br>
oleic acid, elaidic acid, ricinoleic acid, and interesterified<br>
ricinoleic acid; and sucrose/fatty acid esters such as sucrose esters<br>
of caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic<br>
acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid,<br>
ricinoleic acid, and interesterified ricinoleic acid.<br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be more specifically<br>
described with reference to examples, but the present invention<br>
is not limited thereto.<br>
It is to be noted that throughout Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples, analysis conditions for LC/MS (Liquid Chromatography/Mass<br>
Spectrometry) are as follows.<br>

(Example 1)<br>
Into a 1 L four-neck flask equipped with a nitrogen introduction<br>
pipe, a stirrer, a cooling pipe, a thermoregulator, and a dropping<br>
cylinder, 4 . 0 mole (368.4 g) of glycerol was added, and the glycerol<br>
was heated to 100°C. While a reaction temperature was maintained<br>
at 100°C, 8.0 mole (592.6 g) of glycidol and 1.922 g of phosphoric<br>
acid (a product of 85%) were separately dropped therein over 6 hours<br>
to continue a reaction until a concentration of oxirane in the system<br>
reached less than 0.1%. After cooling, a reaction product was taken<br>
out to obtain approximately 950 g of a polyglycerol (PGL 3: average<br>
polymerization degree of approximately 3) . The polyglycerol showed<br>
an OH value of 1,170mg-KOH/g. The obtained polyglycerol was analyzed<br>
by the above LC/MS. Fig. 1 shows the results of componential analysis .<br>
In each of figures below showing the results of componential analysis,<br>
the numbers of a horizontal axis represent degrees of polymerization<br>
of a polyglycerol, and a vertical axis indicates a relative intensity<br>
with a bar graph. On the horizontal axis, a polyglycerol (1), a<br>
polyglycerol (2) having one cyclic structure that contains one cyclic<br>
structure, and a polyglycerol (2) having a cyclic structure that<br>
contains two cyclic structures are indicated with the bar graphs<br>
drawn side by side for each polymerization degree. In each of the<br>
figures, Ideal PGL Groups (PGL) represents a polyglycerol (1), and<br>
PGL-H2O, PGL-2H2O, and the like, represent a polyglycerol having<br>
a cyclic structure formed through removal of one water molecule,<br>
a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure formed through removal<br>
of two water molecules, and the like, respectively.<br>
In the intensity ratio distribution of a polyglycerol of Fig.<br>
1, the polymerization degree "n" of a polyglycerol showing the mode<br>
(the highest distribution rate) was 4, and the ratio of (component<br>
with a polymerization degree "n-1") / (component with a polymerization<br>
degree "n") was 0.5327.<br>
Table 1 Intensity ratio in componential analysis of a polyglycerol<br>
in Example 1<br>
[The polymerization degree "n" of a polyglycerol showing the highest<br>
distribution rate (mode) was 4]<br>
As Table 1 shows, in the reaction product obtained in the<br>
polymerization step according to the process of the present invention,<br>
components with varying degrees of polymerization except unreacted<br>
glycerol provided a distribution corresponding to that obtained<br>
through a successive reaction of glycidol using glycerol as an<br>
initiator. The reaction product having such a distribution can have<br>
improved solvency and so on, though depending on kinds of solutes.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Into a 2 liter four-neck flask having equipment similar to<br>
those of Example 1, 4.4 mole (405.2 g) of glycerol was added, and<br>
the glycerol was heated to 120°C. Subsequently, while a reaction<br>
temperature was maintained at 120 °C, 22.0mole (l,629.8g) of glycidol<br>
and 2.035 g of phosphoric acid (a product of 85%) were separately<br>
dropped therein over 6 hours to continue the reaction until the<br>
concentration of oxirane in the system reached less than 0.1%. After<br>
cooling, a reaction product was taken out to obtain approximately<br>
2,000 g of a polyglycerol (PGL 6: average polymerization degree<br>
of approximately 6). The polyglycerol showed an OH value of 970<br>
mg-KOH/g. Fig. 2 shows the LC/MS analysis results of the obtained<br>
polyglycerol. As Table 2 shows, in the reaction product obtained<br>
in the polymerization step according to the process of the present<br>
invention, components with varying degrees of polymerization except<br>
unreacted glycerol provided a preferred distribution as that in<br>
Example 1.<br>

Into the same flask as that used in Example 2, 2.0 mole (188<br>
g) of glycerol was added, and the glycerol was heated to 100°C.<br>
Subsequently, while a reaction temperature was maintained at 100°C,<br>
18.0 mole (1,332 g) of glycidol and 1.525 g of phosphoric acid (a<br>
product of 85%) were separately dropped therein over 6 hours to<br>
continue the reaction until the concentration of oxirane in the<br>
system reached less than 0.1%. After cooling, a reaction product<br>
was taken out to obtain approximately 1,500 g of a polyglycerol<br>
(PGL 10: average polymerization degree of approximately 10). The<br>
polyglycerol showed an OH value of 885 mg-KOH/g. Fig. 3 shows the<br>
LC/MS analysis results of the obtained polyglycerol. As Table 3<br>
shows, in the reaction product obtained in the polymerization step<br>
according to the process of the present invention, components with<br>
varying degrees of polymerization except unreacted glycerol provided<br>
a preferred distribution as that in Example 1.<br>
Fig. 8(a) shows a liquid chromatogram of the reaction product<br>
of Example 3. In each of the liquid chromatograms shown below, the<br>
horizontal axis represents an elution time and the vertical axis<br>
represents a peak intensity (unit mV) of the chromatogram.<br>

Into the same flask as that used in Example 2, 0.5 mole (47<br>
g) of glycerol was added, and the glycerol was heated to 120°C.<br>
Subsequently, while a reaction temperature was maintained at 120°C,<br>
19.5 mole (1,443 g) of glycidol and 1.525 g of phosphoric acid (a<br>
product of 85%) were separately dropped therein over 12 hours to<br>
continue the reaction until the concentration of oxirane in the<br>
system reached less than 0.1%. After cooling, a reaction product<br>
was taken out to obtain approximately 1,500 g of a polyglycerol<br>
(PGL 40: average polymerization degree of approximately 40) . The<br>
polyglycerol showed an OH value of 787 mg-KOH/g. Fig. 4 shows the<br>
LC/MS analysis results of the obtained polyglycerol. As Table 4<br>
shows, in the reaction product obtained in the polymerization step<br>
according to the process of the present invention, components with<br>
varying degrees of polymerization except unreacted glycerol provided<br>
a preferred distribution as that in Example 1.<br>

Commercially available decaglycerol (available from Sakamoto<br>
Yakuhin Co., Ltd., Decaglycerol #750; a polyglycerol obtained<br>
through dehydration condensation of glycerol, OH value of 8 90<br>
mg-KOH/g) was analyzed by the above LC/MS. Fig. 5 shows the results<br>
of componential analysis . The decaglycerol contains a polyglycerol<br>
(2) having a cyclic structure in very high content.<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
Commercially available decaglycerol (available from Kashima<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd., KCOL-IV-750; a polyglycerol obtained from<br>
epichlorohydrin, OH value of 882 mg-KOH/g) was analyzed by the above<br>
LC/MS. Fig. 6 shows the results of componential analysis. The<br>
decaglycerol contains a polyglycerol (2) having a cyclic structure<br>
in high content.<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
Into the same flask as that used in Example 2, 2.0 mole (188<br>
g) of glycerol was added, and the glycerol was heated to 140°C.<br>
Subsequently, while a reaction temperature was maintained at 140°C,<br>
18.0 mole (1,332 g) of glycidol and 1.525 g of phosphoric acid (a<br>
product of 85%) were separately dropped therein over 6 hours to<br>
continue the reaction until the concentration of oxirane in the<br>
system reached less than 0.1%. After cooling, a reaction product<br>
was taken out to obtain approximately 1,500 g of a polyglycerol<br>
(PGL 10 of Comparative Example 3: average polymerization degree<br>
of approximately 10) . The polyglycerol showed an OH value of 887<br>
mg-KOH/g. Fig. 7 shows the LC/MS analysis results of the obtained<br>
polyglycerol. The polyglycerol contains a polyglycerol (2) having<br>
a cyclic structure and other compounds in high content.<br>
(Comparative Example 4)<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as in Example<br>
3 except that 18.0 mole (1,332 g) of glycidol was added dropwise<br>
over 6 hours into a flask charged with 2.0 mole (188 g) of glycerol<br>
and 1.525 g of phosphoric acid (a product of 85%). The resulting<br>
polyglycerol showed an OH value of 885 mg-KOH/g. Approximately 1,500<br>
g of a polyglycerol (PGL 10 of Comparative Example 4: average<br>
polymerization of approximately 10) was obtained. Fig. 9 shows the<br>
LC/MS analysis results of the obtained polyglycerol. The<br>
polyglycerol contains a polyglycerol (2) having a cyclic structure<br>
and other compounds in high content.<br>
As described above, glycidol and a catalyst are successively<br>
added for a reaction with glycerol, to thereby significantly reduce<br>
the amounts of the by-products of a polyglycerol having a cyclic<br>
structure. Meanwhile, in the process involving dropping of either<br>
glycidol or a catalyst, the amounts of the by-products of a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure are large. Moreover, when<br>
a reaction temperature exceeds 130°C, the amounts of the by-products<br>
of a polyglycerol having a cyclic structure increase.<br>
Hereinafter, the production of a fatty acid ester of a<br>
polyglycerol and its evaluation will be shown.<br>
(Example 5)<br>
Into a reactor with a volume of 2 liter equipped with a stirrer,<br>
a thermometer, a heating jacket, a gas-feed port, and a raw<br>
material-feed port, 1,200 g of a polyglycerol obtained in Example<br>
3 (PGL 10: average polymerization degree of approximately 10) was<br>
added. Subsequently, lauric acid (99% purity) and a 10% sodium<br>
hydroxide aqueous solution were added thereto. The addition amount<br>
of lauric acid was adjusted such that a molar ratio of lauric acid/a<br>
polyglycerol was 1/1. The amount of sodium hydroxide was 0.0025%<br>
by weight with respect to the total amount of a polyglycerol and<br>
lauric acid.<br>
After an internal temperature was elevated to 240°C under<br>
normal pressure in a stream of a nitrogen gas for a 3-hour reaction,<br>
the internal temperature was further elevated to 260°C for a reaction<br>
for 4 hours . After completion of the reaction, the reactor was cooled<br>
to normal temperature to obtain a lauric acid ester of a polyglycerol<br>
(PGLE-1).<br>
(Comparative Example 5)<br>
Esterif ication was carried out in the same manner as in Example<br>
5 to obtain a lauric acid ester of polyglycerol(PGLE-2), except<br>
that the Decaglycerol #750 of Comparative Example 1 was used instead<br>
of the polyglycerol (PGL 10:average polymerization degree of<br>
approximately 10).<br>
(Evaluation of a fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol)<br>
PGLE-1 obtained in Example 5 and PGLE-2 obtained in Comparative<br>
Example 5 were respectively dissolved in desalted water to prepare<br>
10% aqueous solutions. The states of the solutions stored at 5°C<br>
were observed with time. Table 5 shows the results.<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
A polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content<br>
according to the present invention has a reduced content of a<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure formed through intramolecular<br>
dehydration, and thus has a large OH value. As a result, the<br>
polyglycerol having a cyclic structure in low content can be used<br>
in humectants, thickeners, plasticizers, hydrophilic treatment,<br>
and so on. Moreover, a fatty acid ester of a polyglycerol obtained<br>
from the polyglycerol and a fatty acid ester has enhanced properties<br>
such as emulsification, solubilization, dispersion, washing,<br>
anticorrosion, lubrication, static protection, wetting, and can<br>
be used as additives for foods and cosmetic, medical, and industrial<br>
surfactants. Furthermore, the polyglycerol itself can be used in<br>
humectants, thickeners, plasticizers, hydrophilic treatment, and<br>
so on.<br>
