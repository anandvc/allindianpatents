				<td>The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions comprising C12-<br>
C14 dimethyl hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant* in combination<br>
whh certain modified polyaminss which provide increased fabric cleaning benefits. The<br>
compositions also provide increased cotton sail release benefits. The present invention<br>
also relates to methods for laundering fabrics with the disclosed compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Detergent formulator? art faced with the task of devising products to remove a<br>
broad spectrum of soils and stains from fabrics. Chemically and physico-chemically, the<br>
varieties of soils and stains ranges the spectrum from polar toils, such as proteinaceous,<br>
day, and inorganic soils, to non-polar soils, such as soot, carbon-black; by-products of<br>
incomplete hydrocarbon combustion, and organic soils. Detergent compositions have<br>
become more complex as formuUton attempt to provide products which handle all types<br>
concurrently.<br>
Formulators have been highly successful to developing traditional dispersants<br>
which are particularly useful in suspending polar, highly charged , bydrophilic particles<br>
such as day. As yet, however, dispersents designed to disperse sad suspend non-polar,<br>
hydrophobic-type soils and particles have been more difficult to develop. Surprisingly, it<br>
has recently been discovered that the modified polyamints of the present invention are<br>
capable of mediating the re-depositon of non-polar soils<br>
la addition, a wide variety of soil release agents for use in domestic and industrial<br>
abrictreatment processes such as laundering, fabric drying in hot air clothes dryers, «nd<br>
the like are known in the art. Various soil release agents have been commercialized and<br>
are currently used in detergent compositions and fabric softener/antistatic articles and<br>
compositions. Such soil release polymers typically comprise an oligomeric or polymeric<br>
ester "backbone*.<br>
Soil release polymers are generally very effective on polyester or other synthetic<br>
fabrics where the grease, oil or similar hydrophohic stains spread out and form a attached<br>
film and thereby are not easily removed in an aqueous laundering process. Many soil<br>
release polymers have a Less dramatic effect on "blended" fabrics, that is on fabrics that<br>
contpm* a mixture of cotton and synthetic material, and have little or no effect on cotton<br>
articles. The reason for the affinity ofraany soil release agents for synthetic fabric is that<br>
the backbone of a polyester soil release polymer typically comprises a mixture of<br>
terephthalate residues and ethyleneoxy or propyteneoxy polymeric units; the same<br>
materials that comprise the polyester fibers of synthetic fabric. This similar structure of<br>
soil release agents and synthetic fabric produce an intrinsic affinity between these<br>
compounds.<br>
It has now been surprisingly discovered that in addition to the ability to mediate<br>
hydrophobia soil redepowtton, certain polyamines act in concert with selected cationic<br>
surfactants to provide increase fabric soil removal, especially from cotton fabrics. This<br>
increased soil removal benefit has been found to be independent of the type of soil<br>
present on the cotton fabric.<br>
The modified poryamuu/cationio surfactant combinations of the present invention<br>
have the increased benefit of being compatible withhypoohlorite and oxygen "pendd"<br>
bleaching agents. This is especially important in the area of surface active agents that ate<br>
effective on non-colored cotton fabric. The hydrophitic cetiulosic composition of cotton<br>
fabric presents a surface that is not compatible with the traditional polyester<br>
terephthdate-basee soil release agents. Indeed, the polyamines of the present invention<br>
themselves exhibit a propensity for attachment to the surface of the cotton fabric.<br>
The C12 14 dimethyl hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium salts which serve as<br>
cationic surfactants for the purposes of the present invention, combine with the modified<br>
poiyamine surface ageoVdiSpersents to remove soils from fabric surfaces. This<br>
combination of materials also acts to prevent redeposition of soil by holding the soil<br>
suspended in the laundry liquor which is removed prior to rinsing.<br>
It is a purpose of the present invention to provide laundry detergent compositions<br>
which combine C12-C 14 dimethyl hydroxyetiryi quaternary ammonium cationic<br>
surfactsntirwith modified polyamine dispcrsants.<br>
It in a farther object of the present invention to combine theC^^^*1*1110***<br>
hydfoxyethyl quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant and polyamine dispersents with<br>
non-cotton soQ release agents. This combination of ingredient* provides a soil release<br>
benefit to aU laundered fabric as v<br>
It is yet a further purpose of the present Invention to provide a bleach stable<br>
cationic surftctantfpolyamine dispersent composition.<br>
A further purpose of the present invention is to provide a method For laundering<br>
soiled fabric which comprises the step of contacting the soiled fabric, especially cotton,<br>
with a laundry detergent composition containing Ci2-C 14 dimethyl hydroxyethyl<br>
quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants and the disclosed polyamines.<br>

Pprvamme Dispersgnts<br>
The* soil dispersent agents of the present invention are water-soluble or<br>
dispersible, modified polyamines. These polyamines comprise backbones that can be<br>
either linear or cydic. The polyamine backbones can also comprise polyamine branching<br>
chains to a greater or lesser degree. In general, the polyamine backbones described<br>
herein are modified in such a manner that each nitrogen of the polyamine chain is<br>
thereafter described in term* of a unit that is substituted, quaternked, oxidized, or<br>
combinations thereof<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "modification" is denned as<br>
replacing 4 backbone -NH hydrogen atom by an E unit (substitution), quaterniring a<br>
backbone nitrogen (quaternized) or oxidizing a backbone nitrogen to the N-oxlde<br>
(oxidized), lite terms 'modification* and "substitution* are used interchangeably when<br>
referring to the process of replacing a hydrogen atom attached to a backbone nitrogen<br>
with an E unit. Quatcmization or oxidation may take place in some circumstance*<br>
without substitution, but substitution must be accompanied by oxidation or<br>
quaternization of at least one backbone nitrogen.<br>
The linear or non-cyclic polyairone backbones that comprise the cotton soil<br>
release agents of the present invention have the general formula:<br>
s*id backbones prior to subsequent modification, comprise primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary ansaui iritrogeni coimected by R "linking" units. The cyclic poryamuw backbones<br>
comprising the cotton soil release agents of the present invention have the general<br>
formula-<br>
R.<br>
said backbones prior to subsequent modification, comprise primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary amine nitrogens connected by R. "linking" units<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, primary amine nitrogens comprising the<br>
backbone or branching chain once modified are defined as V or Z "terminal" units. For<br>
example, when a primary amine moiety, located at the end of the main polyamine<br>
backbone or branching chain having the structure<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a V "terminal"<br>
unit, or simply a V unit. However, for the purposes of the present invention, some or all<br>
of the primary amine moieties can remain unmodified subject to the restrictions ftirther<br>
described herein below. These unmodified primary amine moieties by virtue of their<br>
position in the backbone chain remain "terminal" units. Likewise, when a primary amine<br>
moiety, located at the end of the main polyamine backbone having the structure<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a Z "terminal"<br>
unit, or simply a Z unit. This unit can remain unmodified subject to the restrictions<br>
further described herein below.<br>
In a similar manner, secondary amine nitrogens comprising the backbone or<br>
branching chain once modified are defined as W "backbone" units. For example, when a<br>
secondary amine moiety, the major constituent of the backbones and branching chains of<br>
the present invention, having the structure<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a W "backbone"<br>
unit, or simply a W unit. However, for the purposes of the present invention, some or all<br>
of the secondary amine moieties can remain unmodified. These unmodified secondary<br>
amine moieties by virtue of their position in the backbone chain remain "backbone" units.<br>
In a further similar manner, tertiary amine nitrogens comprising the backbone or<br>
branching chain once modified are further referred to as Y "branching" units. For<br>
example, when a tertiary amine moiety, which is a chain branch point of either the<br>
polyamine backbone or other branching chains or rings, having the structure<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a Y "branching"<br>
unit, or simply a Y unit. However, for the purposes of toe pre* • nt invention, some or all<br>
or the tertiary amine moieties can remain unmodified. These unmodified tertiary amine<br>
moieties by virtue of their position in the backbone chain remain "branching" units. The<br>
R. units associated with the V, W and Y unit nitrogens which serve to connect the<br>
polyamine nitrogens, are described herein below.<br>
The final modified structure of the polyamines of the present invention can be<br>
therefore represented by the general formula<br>
for linear polyamine cotton soil release polymers and by the general formula<br>
for cyclic polyamine cotton soil release polymers. For the case of polyamine* comprising<br>
rings, a Y unit of the formula<br>
serves as a branch point for a backbone or branch ring. For every Y1 unit there is a Y<br>
unit having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
that will form the connection point of the ring to the main polymer chain or branch. In<br>
tlw unique case where the backbone is a complete ring, the polyamine backbone has the<br>
formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
therefore comprising no 2 terminal unit and having the formula<br>
wherein k i* the number of ring forming branching units. Preferably the polyamine<br>
backboDM of the present invention comprise no rings<br>
In the cave of non-cyclic polyamincs, the ratio of the index n to the index m<br>
relatas-to the relative degree of branching. A folly non-branched linear modified<br>
polyamine according to the present invention has the formal*<br>
that in, n ia equal to 0. Th* greater the value of n (the lower the ratio of m to A), the<br>
greater the degree of branching in th« molecule. Typically the value fbrm ranges from a<br>
minimum value of 4 to about 400, however larger values of m, especially when the value<br>
of the index n i* very low or nearly 0, are also preferred.<br>
Hack poryanune nitrogen whether primary, secondary or tertiary, once modified<br>
according to the present invention, is further defined as being a member of one of three<br>
general classes, simple substituted, quatemized or oxidized. Those polyamine nitrogen<br>
units not modified ire classed into V, W, Y, or Z units depending on whether they are<br>
primary, secondary or tertiary nitrogens. That i$ unmodified primary amine nitrogens are<br>
V or Z units, unmodified secondary amine nitrogens are W units and unmodified tertiary<br>
amine nitrogens are Y units for the purposes of the present invention<br>
Modified primary amine moieties are defined as V "terminal" units having one of<br>
three forms:<br>
a) simple substituted units having the structure:<br>

When any position on a nitrogen is unsubstiruted of unmodified, it is understood<br>
that hydrogen will substitute for E. For example, a primary amine unit comprising one E<br>
unit in the form of a hydroxyethyl moiety is a V terminal unit having the formula<br>
For the purposes of the present invention there are two types of chain terminating<br>
units, the V and Z units. The Z "terminal" unit derives from a terminal primary amino<br>
moiety of the structure -NH2- Non-cyclic polyamine backbones according to the present<br>
invention comprise only one Z unit whereas cyclic polyamines can comprise no Z units.<br>
The Z "terminal" unit can be substituted with any of the E units described ftirther herein<br>
below, except when the Z unit is modified to form an N-oxide. In the case where the Z<br>
unit nitrogen it oxidized to an N-oxide, the nitrogen must be modified and therefore E<br>
cannot be a hydrogen.<br>

The preferred cotton soil release agents of the present invention comprise<br>
polyamine backbones wherein less than about 50% of the R groups comprise "oxy" R<br>
units, preferably less than about 20% , more preferably less than 5%, most preferably<br>
the R units comprise no "oxy" R units.<br>
The most preferred cotton soil release agents which comprise no "oxy" R unit*<br>
comprise polyamin* backbones wherein less than 50% of the R groups comprise more<br>
than 3 carbon atoms. For example, ethylene, 1,2-propylene, and 1,3-propylene comprise<br>
3 or less carfxm atoms and are the preferred "hydrocarbyT R units. That is when<br>
backbone R. units are C2-C12 alkylene, preferred is C2-C3 alkylene, most preferred is<br>
ethylene.<br>
The cotton soil release agents of the present invention comprise modified<br>
homogeneous and non-homogeneous polyamine backbones, wherein 100% or less of the<br>
~NH units are modified, for the purpose of the present invention the term<br>
"homogeneous polyamine backbone" is defined as a polyamine backbone having R units<br>
that ar» the same (i.e., all ethylene). However, this sameness definition does not exclude<br>
polyaraines that comprise other extraneous units comprising the polymer backbone<br>
which are present due to an artifact of the chosen method of chemical synthesis. For<br>
example, it is known to those skilled in the an that ethanolamine may be used as an<br>
"initiator* in the synthesis of potyethylenelnunes, therefore a sample of polyethyteneunine<br>
that comprises one hydroxyethyl moiety resulting from the polymerization "initiator"<br>
would be considered to comprise a homogeneous polyamine backbone for the purposes<br>
of the present invention. A polyamine backbone comprising all ethylene R units wherein<br>
no branching Y units are present is a homogeneous backbone. A polyamine backbone<br>
comprising all ethylene R units is a homogeneous backbone regardless of the degree of<br>
branching or the number of cyclic branches present.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "non-homogeneous polymer<br>
backbone* refers to poh/vmne backbones that are a composite of various R unit lengths<br>
add RimH types. For example, a non-homogeneous backbone comprises R units that are<br>
a mixture of ethylene and 1,2-propylene units. For the purposes of the present invention<br>
a mixture of *hydrocarbyl" and "oxy* R units is not necessary to provide a nonhomogeneous<br>
backbone. The proper manipulation of these "R unit chain lengths*<br>
provides the formutator with the ability to modify the sohibflfcy and febric substantivity<br>
of the cotton soil release agents of the present invention.<br>
Preferred cotton toil release polymers of the present invention comprise<br>
homogeneous polyainine backbones that are totally or partially substituted by<br>
poiyethyleneoxy moieties, totally or partially quatemized amines, nitrogens totally or<br>
partially oxidized to N-oxid**, and mixtures thereof However, not all backbone amine<br>
nitrogens must b« modified In the same manner, the choice of modification being left to<br>
the specific need* ofthe rbrmulator. The degree of ethoxylation is also determined by<br>
the specific requirement* ofthe formulator.<br>
The preferred polyamines that comprise the backbone ofthe compounds ofthe<br>
present invention are generally polyalkyleneamines (PAA's), polyalkyieneonines (PAI's),<br>
preferably polyethyteneamine (PEA's), polyethyleneimines (PETs), or PEA'j or PEr*<br>
connected by moieties having longer R units than the parent PAA's, P ATs, P£A's or<br>
PEI's. A common polyalkvteneamine (PAA) is tetrabutylenepentainine. PEA's are<br>
obtained by reactions involving ammonia and ethylene dichloride, followed by fractional<br>
distillation. The common PEA's obtained are tnethylenetetramine (TETA) and<br>
teraethylenepentanune (TEPA). Above the pentamines, i.e
octamines and possibly nonamines, the cogenerically derived mixture does not appear to<br>
separate by distillation and can include other materials such as cyclic amines and<br>
particularly pipermzines. There can also be present cyclic amines with side chains in<br>
which nitrogen atoms appear. See U.S. Patent 2,792,372, Dickinsoa issued May 14,<br>
1957, which describes the preparation of PEA's.<br>
Preferred imine polymer backbones comprise R units that are C% alkylene<br>
(ethytene) units, also known as poryethytenimines (PEI's). Preferred PEFs have at least<br>
moderate branching, that is the ratio of rti to n is kss than 4:1, however PEI's having a<br>
ratio of m to n of about 2. 1 are most preferred. Preferred backbones, prior to<br>
modification hav« the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein m and n are tha same as defined herein above. Preferred PEFs, prior to<br>
modification, wifl have a molecular weight greater than about 200 daltonfi.<br>
The relative proportions of primary, secondary and. tertiary amine units in the<br>
polyamine backbone, especially in the case of PETa, will vary, depending on the manner<br>
of preparation. Each hydrogen atom attached to each nitrogen atom ofthe polyamine<br>
backbone chain represents a potential site for subsequent substitution, quaternizHtion or<br>
oxidation.<br>
These polyamlnes cam be prepared, for example, by polymerizing ethyleneiinine in<br>
the presence of a catalyst such as carbon dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sulfuric add,<br>
hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, etc. Specific methods for preparing<br>
these polyamine backbones are disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,182,306, Ulrich et al., issued<br>

formulator may choose to modify all or a portion of (He primary amioe nitrogens with<br>
one or more substitucnts prior to oxidation or quaternization. Any possible combination<br>
of E groups can be substituted on the primary and secondary amine nitrogens, except for<br>
the restrictions described herein above.<br>

include sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium cumenesulfonate, sodium<br>
toluenesulfonate, sodium xylenesulfonate, and mixtures thereof. When higher levels of<br>
stabilizers ar« used, mixtures of hydrotropes and/or other stabilizers are preferred over<br>
pure components to insure full integration into the oligoraer and to reduce the possibility<br>
of crystallization of the stabilizer.<br>
In general, the level of such agents should be kept u low as possible while<br>

surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also<br>
advantageous. If desired, soluble magnesium salts such as MgC^, MgSO^ and the like,<br>
can be added at levels of, typically, 0. l%-2%, to provide additional suds and to enhance<br>
grease removal performance.<br>
Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally<br>
can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic<br>
substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobio coating. Preferably, the<br>
detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous<br>
substrate. In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous<br>
washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function.<br>
To illustrate this technique in more detail, a porous hydrophobic sflka (trademark<br>
SIPERNAT DID, OeGussa) is admixed with a proteolytic enzyme solution containing<br>
3%-5%-of C^,^ ethoxylated alcohol (EO 7) nonionic surfactant. Typically, the<br>
enzyme/surfactant solution Is 2.5 X the weight of silica. The resulting powder is<br>
dispersed with stirring in silicon* oil (various silicone oil viscosities in the range of 5OO-<br>
12,500 can be used). The resulting silicone oil dispersion is emulsified or otherwise<br>
added to the final detergent matrix. By this means, ingredients such as the<br>
aforementioned enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, photoactivators,<br>
dyes, fluorescefs, fabric conditioners and hydrolyzable surfactants can be "protected11 for<br>
use in detergents, including liquid laundry detergent compositions.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers.<br>
Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanoi, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for<br>
solubilizang surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon<br>
atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol,<br>
glycerin, and 1,2-propanediot) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5%<br>
to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during<br>
use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5<br>
and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 10,5. Laundry products are typically at<br>
pH 9-11 Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels Include the use of<br>
buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in thwart.<br>

are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostabiUty, and<br>
stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal<br>
enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain<br>
removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal<br>
care detergent composition. Preferred detersive enzymes are hydrolases such as<br>
proteases, amylases and Upases. Preferred enzymes for laundry purposes include, but are<br>
not ImitecHo, proteases, ceQuiases, Upases and peroxidascs.<br>
Enzymes ar* normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive<br>
compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cteanrng^ffective amount1*. The term<br>
"cleaning effective amount* refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain<br>
removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on<br>
substrates such as fabrics. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical<br>
amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active<br>
enzyme p«r gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions<br>
herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01 W-1% by weight of a<br>
commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes Are usually present in such<br>
commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide front 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units<br>
(AU) of activity per gram, of composition. For certain detergents it may be deniable to<br>
increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize<br>
the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve<br>
spotting/filming or other end-results, Higher active levels nay also be desirable in highly<br>
concentrated detergent formulations.<br>

Enzyme; StabUjjzJng System . Enzyme-containing, including but not limited to, liquid<br>
compositions, herein may comprise from about 0.001% to about 10%, preferably from<br>
about* 00«% to about 8%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 6%, by weight<br>
of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing<br>
system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme. Such a system may be inherently<br>
provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the forraulator or<br>
by a maniifkcturer of detergent-ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems can, for<br>
example, comprise calcium ion, boric acid, propylena glycol, short chain carboxylic<br>
acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different<br>
stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent<br>
composition.<br>
One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or<br>
magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes.<br>
Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein<br>
if only one type of cation Is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially<br>
liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20,<br>
more preferably from about 8 to about 12 miliimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished<br>
detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the<br>
multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium<br>
or magnesium salts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium<br>
hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium nutate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and<br>
calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sutfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the<br>
exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or<br>
Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action<br>
of certain types of surfactant.<br>
Another stabilizing approach is by use of bortte species. See Severson, U.S.<br>
4,537,706. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the<br>
composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or<br>
other borate compounds such aa borax or onhoborate are suitable for liquid detergent<br>
use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, pbromophenylboronic<br>
acid or the like can be used in place of boric add and reduced levels<br>
of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such<br>
substituted boron derivatives.<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions may further comprise from 0<br>
to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach<br>
scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies<br>
fhno-MCaekmg and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions. While<br>
chlorine levels in water may be small* typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about<br>
1,75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with<br>
the enzyme, for example during fabric-washing, can be relatively large; accordingly,<br>
enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or<br>
percaibonaie, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain<br>
of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing<br>
system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be<br>
essential, though improved results may be obtainable (com their use. Suitable chlorine<br>
scavenger unions arc widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts<br>
containing ammonium cations with sulftte, bisulfite, thiosutfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc.<br>
Antioxidants such as carbarnate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines such as<br>
ethylenediaminstetracetlc acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolamine<br>
(ME A), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used. Likewise, special enzyme inhibition<br>
systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility<br>
Other conventional scavengers such as bisul&amp;te, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen<br>
peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and<br>
sodium pcrcarlxmate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate,<br>
citrate, formate, lactate, rnatate, tartrate, saltcylate, etc., and mixture* thereof can be<br>
used if desired In general, since the chlorine scavenger function c*a be performed by<br>
ingredients separately listed under better recognized {Unctions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide<br>
sources), there ss no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a<br>
compound performing that fUnctkm to the desired extent is absent from an enzymecontaining,<br>
embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for<br>
optimum results. Moreover, the formulator wilt exercise » chemist's normal skill in<br>
avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorly incompatible, as<br>
formulated, with other reactive ingredients, if used. In relation to the use of ammonium<br>
salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to<br>
adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage. Accordingly, such materials, if<br>
present, are desirably protected in a particle such a$ that described in US 4,652,392,<br>

sources such as PMC. Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Mixtures of bleaching agents can also b* used.<br>
Peroxygen bleaching agents, the perborates, the percarbonates, etc., are<br>
prefertfily combined with bleach activators, which lead to the in situ production in<br>

manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,246,621, U.S. Pat. 5,244,594; U.S.<br>
Pat. 5,194,416, U.S. Pat. 5,114,606; and European Pat. App. Pub. Nos. S49,271A1,<br>
549.272A1, 544,440A2, and 544,490A1, Preferred examples of these catalysts include<br>
MnIV2(u-O)3( 1 ,4,7-trimcthyl- 1 ,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(PF6)2, MnDIjCu-O)! (u-<br>
OAc)2(!,4,7-trimethyi-l,4,7-triazaoyclononane)2.(ClO4)2. MnJV^u-O^MJtriazacydoiwiuuw)<br>
n^(l,4 J-trimethyl-1 ,4,7-triazacyclononane)-<br>
)t and mixtures thereof. Other metal-based bleach catalysts include those<br>
disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,430,243 and U.S. Pat. 5,114,611. The use of manganese with<br>
various complex: Uganda to enhance bleaching is also reported in the following United<br>
State* Patents: 4,728,455; 5,284,944; 5,246,612; 5,256,779; 5,280,117; 5,274,147;<br>
5,153,161, and 5,227,084.<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and<br>
processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per ten<br>
million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing liquor, and will<br>
preferably provide from about 0.1 ppm to about 700 ppm, more preferably from about 1<br>
ppm to about 500 ppm, of the catalyst species in the laundry liquor.<br>
* Detergent builders can optionally be included in the compositions<br>
herein to assist in controlling mineral hardness. Inorganic as well as organic builders can<br>
be used. Builders are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the<br>
removal of paniculate soils.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the<br>
composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically<br>
comprise at least about 1% builder. Liquid formulations typically comprise from about<br>
5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent<br>
builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more<br>
typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or<br>
higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builder* include, but are not limited to, the<br>
alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by<br>
the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphatcs),<br>
phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and<br>
sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non*pho&amp;phat6 builders are<br>
required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well<br>
even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates)<br>
such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or<br>
layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those<br>
having a SiO2-Na2O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the<br>
layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Patent 4,664,839, issued May 12,1987 to H.<br>
P. Rieck. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by<br>
Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS'6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na<br>
SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the detta-Na2SiO5<br>
morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those<br>
described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly<br>
preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those<br>
having the general formula NaMSijjOjx+j -yE^O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is<br>
a number firont 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y tea number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be<br>
used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7<br>
and NaSKS-11, aft the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-.<br>
N^SiOs (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be<br>
luefuHnch ax for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as ft crispenmg agent in<br>
granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of<br>
suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates<br>
as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15,<br>
1973.<br>
Aluminosilieate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate<br>
builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular<br>
detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid<br>
detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical<br>
formula:<br>
Mz(zAl02)y] xH20<br>
wherein t and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from<br>
1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
Useful aluminoalicate ion exchange materials *re commercially available. These<br>
aluminosilicaten can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturallyoccurring<br>
aluminosilicate* or synthetically derived. A method for producing<br>
ataminosilieate ton exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,985,669, Krummel,<br>
et al, issued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion<br>
exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P<br>
(B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline<br>
aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as<br>
Zeolite A Dehydrated zeolites (x - 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the<br>
aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0. 1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention<br>
include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used<br>
herein, "polycarboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups,<br>
preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the<br>
composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When<br>
utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or<br>
alkanotammonium salts are preferred.<br>
— Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful<br>
materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether<br>
polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed In Berg, U.S. Patent 3,128,287,<br>
issued April 7, 1964, and Lamberti et alf U.S. Patent 3,635,830, Issued January 18, 1972.<br>
See also "TMS/TDS" buUders of U.S. Patent 4,663,071, issued to Bush et al, on May 5,<br>
1987, Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly<br>
talicyclic<br>
compounds, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,923.679; 3,835,163;<br>
4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102.903.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates,<br>
copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy<br>
benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali<br>
metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of poly»c«tc acids such as<br>
ethylenedianune tetraacetic acid and nitriiotriacetic acid, » well as polycarboxylates such<br>
as metlitic acid, succinic add, oxydisucciiuc acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-<br>
tticarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium<br>
salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid<br>
detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their<br>
biodegradabilrty. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in<br>
combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. OxydUuccinates are also<br>
especially useful In such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-<br>
dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
4,566,984, Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the €5-<br>
€20 olkyl &amp;nd alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred<br>
compound of this type is dodecenyf succinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders<br>
include: laurylsuodnate, myristylsuccinate, palmitytsuccinate, 2-dodecenybuccinate<br>
(preferred), 2-pentadecenybucdnate. and the like. Lauryisuccinates are the preferred<br>
builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application<br>
86200690,5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4.144,226,<br>
CrutchSeld «t at, issued March 13,1979 and in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Dtehl, issued<br>
March 7,1967, See also Diehi U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br>
—Fatty acidi, «.£., C^Cig monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into<br>
the compositions alone, or In combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate<br>
and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty<br>
acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account<br>
bythefbrmuUtor<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the<br>
formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal<br>
phosphates Such as the wdl-lcnown sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate<br>
and sodium orthophosphate can be used Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-<br>
hydroxy-l.l-diphosphonate and other known phosphorates (see, for example, U.S.<br>
Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be u«sd.<br>
gplymerfc Soil Release Agent - In addition to the preferred soil release agents<br>
noted hereinbefore, known polymeric soil release agents, hereinafter "SRA", can<br>
optionally be employed in the present detergent compositions. If utilized, SRA's will<br>
generally compuse from 0.01% to 10.0%, typically from 0.1% to 5%, preferably from<br>
02% to 3.0% by weight, of the compositions.<br>
Preferred SRA's typically have hydrophilic segments to hydrophUize the surface of<br>
hydrophobia fibers such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments to deposit<br>
upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and<br>
rinsing cycles, thereby serving u an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can<br>
enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the SRA to be more easily cleaned<br>
in later washing procedures.<br>
SRA's can include a variety of charged, e.g., anionic or even cationic species, see<br>
U.S. 4,956,447, issued September 11, 1990 to Gosselinfc, et al., as well as noncharged<br>
monomer units, and their structures may be linear, branched or even star-shaped. They<br>
may include capping moieties which are especially effective in controlling molecular<br>
weight or altering the physical or surface-active properties. Structures and charge<br>
distributions may be tailored for application to different fiber or textile types and for<br>
varied detergent or detergent additive products.<br>
Preferred SRA'* include oligomeric terephthalate esters, typically prepared by<br>
processes involving at least one tnuwesterification/oligomerization, often with a metal<br>
catalyst such as a thanium(TV) alkoxide. Such esters may be made using additional<br>
monomer* capable of being incorporated into the ester structure through one, two, three,<br>
four or more positions, without, of course, forming a densely crosslinked overall<br>
structure.<br>
Suitable SRA's include a sulfonated product of a substantially linear ester oligomer<br>
comprised of an oligomeriq ester backbone of terephthaloyl and oxyattcyleneoxy repeat<br>

for example as described in US 4,968,451, November 6, 1990 to J.J. Scheibel and E.P.<br>
Gosselink. Such ester oligomer* can be prepared by: (a) ethoxylating allyl alcohol; (b)<br>
reacting the product of (a) with dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") and 1,2-propylene<br>
gfycol ("PG") in a two-stage transesterification/oligomerization procedure; and (c)<br>
reacting the product of (b) with sodium tnetabisulfite in water. Other SRA's include the<br>
nonionic end-capped 1,2-propylene/polyoxyethylene terephthalate polyesters of U.S.<br>

process" as described in U.S. 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and in front-loading Europeanstyle<br>
washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds<br>
suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othroer<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of particular interest<br>
ancompasses monocarboxytio fatty acid and soluble salts therein. See U.S. Patent<br>

hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have<br>
a pour point in the range of about -40'C and about 50°C» and a minimum boiling point<br>
not less than about 1 10"C (atmospheric pressure). It is also known to utilize waxy<br>
hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100°C. The hydrocarbons<br>
constitute a preferred category of suds suppressor for detergent compositions.<br>

The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those<br>

selected from N-2'bi*-hydroxyethyl, N^-hydroxyetnyl-N-methvlarnino, morphilino,<br>
chloro and amino, and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium or potassium.<br>
When in the above formula, Rj is aniline, Rj is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyi and M « a<br>

brighten«r apectea is commercially marketed under the tradenanve Tinopal-UNPA-GX by<br>
Cib»-Gtigy Corporation. Tinopai-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical<br>
brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.<br>
"When in the above formula, Rj is anilino, R£ fo N-2rhydJraxyethyl-N-2«<br>
methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the btifihttmer is 4i4'-bis[(4-an11ino~6-(N2-<br>

tradename Tinopal SBM-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation.<br>
When in the above formula, R[ is anilino, R2 is morphilino and M is a cation such<br>

The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention<br>
provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in<br>
combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore<br>
described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e\g, PVNO and/or<br>
PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (*.g.. Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal SBMGX<br>
and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in<br>
aqueous, wa&amp;h solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components<br>
when used alone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brightener?<br>
work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and<br>
therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics. The extent to which brighteners<br>
deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the<br>
"exhaustion coefficient*. The exhaustion coefficient is in general as the ratio of a) the<br>
brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the<br>
wash liquor. Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most<br>
suitable for inhibiting dye transfer b the context of the present invention.<br>
Of course, it will be appreciated that Other, conventional optical brightener types<br>
of compounds can optionally be u«d in the present compositions to provide conventional<br>
fabric "brightness* benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect Such usage is<br>
conventional and well-known to detergent formulations,<br>

rate. The ethylenc oxide pump is turned off and cooling is applied to limit any<br>
temperature increase resulting from any reaction exotherm The temperature is<br>
maintained between 100 and 110 "C while the total pressure is allowed to gradually<br>
increase during the course of the reaction. After a total of 750 grams of ethylene oxide<br>
has been charged to the autoclave (roughly equivalent to one mole ethylene oxide per<br>
PEI nitrogen function), the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the autoclave is<br>
allowed to stir for an additional hour. At this point, vacuum is applied to remove any<br>
residual unre*#ed ethylene oxide.<br>
Next, vacuum ia continuously applied while the autoclave is cooled to about 50 °<br>
C v/hile introducing 376 g of a 25% sodium methoxide in methanol solution (1.74 moles,<br>
to achieve a 10% catalyst loading based upon PEI nitrogen functions). The methoxide<br>
solution i&amp; sucked into the autoclave under vacuum and then the autoclave temperature<br>
controller setpoint is increased to 130 °C. A device is used to monitor the power<br>
consumed by the agitator. The agitator power is monitored along with the temperature<br>
and pressure. Agitator power and temperature values gradually increase as. methanol is<br>
removed from the autoclave and the viscosity of the mixture increases and stabilizes in<br>
about 1 hour indicating that most of the methanol has been removed. The mixture is<br>
further heated and agitated under vacuum for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
-—Vacuum is removed and the autoclave is cooled to 105 dC while It is being<br>
charged with nitrogen to 250 psia and then vented to ambient pressure. The autoclave is<br>
charged to 200 psia with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide is again added to the autoclave<br>
incrementally as before while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature,<br>
and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 110 aC<br>
and limiting any temperature increases due to reactic n exotherm. After the addition of<br>
4500 g of ethylene oxide (resulting in a total of 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of<br>
PEI nitrogen function) is achieved over several hours, the temperature is increased to<br>
110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional hour.<br>
The reaction mixture is then collected in nitrogen purged containers and eventually<br>
transferred into a 22 L three neck round bottomed flask equipped with heating and<br>
agitation. The strong alkali catalyst is neutralized by adding 167 g methaneaulfonic acid<br>
(1.74 moles) The reaction mixture is then deodorized by passing about 100 cu. ft. of<br>
inert gas (argon or nitrogen) through a gas dispersion fiit and through the reaction<br>
mixture while agitating and heating the mixture to 130 °C.<br>
The final reaction product is cooled slightly and collected in glass containers<br>
purged with nitrogen<br>
In other preparations the neutralization and deodorization is accomplished in the<br>
reactor before discharging the product.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Ouatemization of PEI 1800 E7<br>
To a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added<br>
poryethyleneimine having a molecular weight of 1800 which is further modified by<br>
ethoxylation to a degree of approximately 7 ethyleneoxy residues pec nitrogen (PEI<br>
1800, E7) (207,3 g, 0.590 mol nitrogen, prepared as in Example I) and acetoririle (120<br>
g). Dimethyl suilale (28.3&amp; 0.224 mol) u added in one portion to the rapidly stirring<br>
solution, which u then stoppered and stirred at room temperature overnight. The<br>
acetonitrile b removed by rotary evaporation at about 60°C, Mowed by further<br>
stripping of solvent using &amp; Kugelrohr apparatus at approximately 80oC to afford 220 g<br>
of the desired partially quaternized material as a dark brown viscous liquid. The 13CKMK<br>
(D2O) spectrum obtained on a sample of the reaction product indicates the<br>
absence of a carbon resonance at -58ppm corresponding to dimethyl sulfate. The 1HNMR<br>
(Di°) spectrum shows a partial shifting of the resonance at about 2,5 ppm for<br>
methylenes adjacent to unquaternized nitrogen has shifted to approximately 3.0 ppm.<br>
This is consistant with the desired quaternization of about 38% of the nitrogens.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Formation of amine oxide..of PEI 1800 E7<br>
To a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added<br>
polyethyleneimine having a molecular weight of 1800 and ethoxylated to a degree of<br>
about 7 ethoxy groups per nitrogen (PEI 800, E?) (209 g, 0.595 mol nitrogen,<br>
prepared as in Example I), and hydrogen peroxide (120 g of a 30 wt % solution in water,<br>
1.06 mol). The flask is stoppered, and after an initial exotherm the solution U stirred at<br>
room temperature overnight. 1H-NMR (D20) spectrum obtained on 4 sample of the<br>
reaction mixture indicates complete conversion. The resonances ascribed to methylene<br>
protons adjacent to unoxidized nitrogens have shifted from the original position at -2,5<br>
ppm to -3.5 ppm. To the reaction solution is added approximately S g of 0.5% Pd on<br>
alumina pellets, and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for<br>
approximately 3 days. The solution is tested and found to be negative for peroxide by<br>
indicator paper. The material as obtained is suitably stored as a 51 1% active solution in<br>
water.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Oxidation of Ouaternized PEI1800E7<br>
To a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added<br>
polyethylenetmine having a molecular weight of 1800 which is further modified by<br>
ethoxylation to a degree of 7 ethyleneoxy residues per nitrogen (PEI 1800 E7)<br>
subsequently quaternized with dimethyl sulfate to approximately 4.7% (121.7 g, -0.32<br>
mol oxidizeabie nitrogen), hydrogen peroxide (40 g of a SO wt% solution in water, 0.588<br>
mot), and water (109,4 g). The flask is stoppered, and after an initial exothetm the<br>
solution is stirred at room temperature overnight, 'H-NMR (D^O) spectrum obtained.<br>
on a sample of the reaction mixture indicates the methylene peaks at 2.5-3.0 ppm have<br>
shifted to -3,5 ppm. To th* reaction solution is added -S g of 0.5 % Pd on alumina<br>
pellets, and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for ~3 days. The<br>
solution is tested and found to be negative for peroxide by indicator paper. The desired<br>
material with --4.7% of the nitrogens quaternized and -95.3% of the nitrogens oxidized<br>
to the amine oxide is obtained and is suitably stored as a 46.5% solution in water.<br>
Granular compositions, for example, are generally node by combining base<br>
granule ingredients (e.g. surfectants, builders, water, etc.) as a starry, and spray drying<br>
the resulting alurry to a low level of residual moisture (5-12%). The remaining dry<br>
ingredients can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules, in a<br>
rotary-fluxing drum and the liquid ingredients (e.g. enzymes, binders and perfumes) can<br>
be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition.<br>
Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form",<br>
i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e.<br>
from 550 to 950 g/l In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the<br>
present invention will contain a lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to<br>
conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of<br>
sulfate and chlorides, typically sodium sulfte; "compact" detergents typically comprise<br>
not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Preparation of PEI I200 E-7<br>
The ethoxylation is conducted in a 2 gallon stirred stainless steel autoclave<br>
equipped for temperature measurement and control, pressure measurement, vacuum and<br>
inert gas purging, sampling, add for introduction of ethylene oxide as a liquid A~201b<br>
net cylinder of ethylene oxide (ARC) is set up to deliver ethylene oxide as. a liquid by a<br>
pump to the autoclave with the cylinder placed on a scale so that the weight change of<br>
the cylinder could be monitored.<br>
A 750 g portion of polyethyleneimine (PEI) ( having a listed average molecular<br>
weight of 1200 equating to about 0.625 moles of polymer and 17.4 moles of nitrogen<br>
functions) is added to the autoclave. The autoclave is then sealed and purged of air (by<br>
applying vacuum to minus 28" Hg followed by preasurization with nitrogen to 250 psia,<br>
then venting to atmospheric pressure). The autoclave contents are heated to 130 °C<br>
while applying vacuum. After about one hour, the autoclave is charged with nitrogen to<br>
about 250 psia while cooling the autoclave to about 105 °C. Ethylene oxide is then<br>
added to the autoclave incrementally over time while closely monitoring the autoclave<br>
pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate. The ethylene oxide pump is tumed<br>
off and cooling is applied to limit any temperature increase resulting from any reaction<br>
exotherm The temperature is maintained between 100 and 110 °C while the total<br>
pressure is allowed to gradually increase during the course of the reaction. After a total<br>
of 750 grams of ethylene oxide hi* been charged to the autoclave (roughly equivalent to<br>
one mote ethylene oxide per PEI nitrogen function), the temperature is Increased to 110<br>
°C and the autoclave is allowed to stir for an additional hour. At this point, vacuum is<br>
applied to remove any residual unreacted ethylene oxide.<br>
Next, vacuum is continuously applied while the autoclave is coaled to about 50 °<br>
C while-introducing 376 g of a 25% sodium methoxide in methanol solution (1.74 moles,<br>
to achieve a 10% catalyst loading based upon PEI nitrogen functions) The methoxide<br>
solution is sucked rato the autoclave under vacuum and then the autoclave temperature<br>
controller setpoint a increased to 130 'C. A device is used to monitor the power<br>
consumed by the agitator. The agitator power is monitored along with the temperature<br>
and presure. Agitator power and temperature values gradually increase as methsnol is<br>
removed from the autoclave and the viscosity of the mixture increases and stabilizes in<br>
about I hour indicating that most of the methanol has been removed The mixture is<br>
further heated and agitated under vacuum for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
Vacuum is removed and the autoclave is cooled to 105 °C while it is being<br>
charged with nitrogen to 250 psia and then vented to ambient pressure. The autoclave is<br>
charged to 200 psia with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide is again added to the autoclave<br>
incrementally as before while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature,<br>
and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 110 °C<br>
and limiting any temperature increases due to reaction exotherm. After the addition of<br>
4500 g of ethylene oxide (resulting in a total of 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mola of<br>
PEI nitrogen function) is achieved over several hours, the temperature is increased to<br>
110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional hour.<br>
The reaction mixture is then collected in nitrogen purged containers and eventually<br>
transferred into a 22 L three neck round bottomed flask equipped with heating and<br>
agitation. The strong alkali catalyst is neutralized by adding 167 g methanesulfonic add<br>
(1.74 moles). The reaction mixture is then deodorized by passing about 100 cu. ft. of<br>
inert gas (argon or nitrogen) through a gas dispersion frit and through the reaction<br>
mixture white agitating and heating the mixture to 130 °C.<br>
The final reaction product is cooled slightly and collected in glass containers<br>
purged with nitrogen.<br>
In other preparations the neutralization and doodorization is accomplished in the<br>
reactor before discharging the product.<br>
Other preferred examples such as PEI 1200 E15 and PEI 1200 E20 can be<br>
prepared by the above method by adjusting the reaction time and the relative amount of<br>
ethylene oxide used in the reaction.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>

on the rotary evaporator at -60oC, followed by a Kugelrohr apparatus (Aldrich) at -80°<br>
C to afford -220g of the desired material as a dark brown viscous liquid. A13C-NMR<br>
{D2O) spectrum chows the absence of a peak at -58ppm corresponding to dimethyl<br>
sulfate. A 1H-NMR (D2O) spectrum shows the partial shifting of the peak at 2.5ppm<br>
(methylenes attached to unquatemized nitrogens) to -3 .Oppm.<br>
