TECHNICAL FlliLD<br>
This invention relates to neutralized ethylene-acrylic acid polymer dispersions and use of the dispersions to prepare substrates for receiving images in electrophotographic and digital offset printing applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF TI IF. INVENTION<br>
Indigo liquid toner offset printing is a hybrid of electrophotographic printing and offset printing. Electrophotographic printing generally involves charging a photosensitive receptor drum, laser scanning an image or text area of the photosensitive receptor surface, depositing charged toner particles onto the image area of the photosensitive receptor drum to develop a latent image, transferring the toner image from the photosensitive receptor drum to a charged substrate like paper, and finally fusing the toner particles on the paper surface with heat and pressure. Offset printing simply means that there is an intermediate blanket cylinder that transfers the ink or toner image from its origin on the plate cylinder to the final substrate (i.e. paper).<br>
In most electrophotographic printers, dry powder toner particles that consist of color pigment, charge director, and polymer binder are used. There is a lower limit of 7 to 9 microns on the particle size of these toners because as they become smaller, they can become airborne in the press. This results in printing problems and may cause health problems for the press operators,. The large toner particles hurt print quality because of their inability to reproduce fine detail and acceptable colors. Therefore, high quality images cannot be printed with dry toner electrophotographic printers.<br>
Liquid toner formulations contain toner particles as small as I to 2 microns because the solvent in the formula keeps them from becoming airborne. Images produced from these toners have higher quality due to their ability to be transferred precisely onto the photosensitive receptor surface. The solvent in liquid toner formulations must be removed either by evaporation prior to the transfer of toner to the paper surface or by drying after the toner has been transferred to the paper, hi digital offset printing (e.g. HP Indigo printer), a thermal offset blanket cylinder is placed between the photosensitive image drum and the paper surface that is supported on the back side by an impression dmm. The liquid toner is heated by<br>
the offset blanket cylinder to first eause the pigment-carrying particles in the liquid loner to melt and solvate into a uniform blend, and then to evaporate the solvent when the offset blanket cylinder transfers the liquid toner onto the paper surface. When the liquid toner contacts the cool paper surface, it becomes viscous enough to adhere to the paper and solidify immediately to allow fast printing. The thermal offset in an Indigo printer provides two advantages over dry powder electrophotographic printing: the paper does not need to be conductive in order to receive the toner and no fusion step is needed to melt the dry toner particles to the paper surface.<br>
Toner adhesion failure has been a problem for both electrophotographic and digital offset printing   The toner adhesion failure is particularly severe for digital offset printing due to the lack of a tusion step to fix the liquid toner particles onto the paper surface. Poor toner adhesion results in incomplete transfer of the toner to the paper surface, leaving a residue behind on the offset blanket cylinder, and low resistance of the printed image to becoming dislodged in subsequent converting operations. A process called sapphire treatment is being used to coat the paper surface with a layer of polyethyleneimine to improve liquid toner adhesion. But sapphire treatment has drawbacks that include a limited paper shelf life of six to eight months, yellowing, the need to apply the coating in an additional step after paperrnaking, and a tendency for me toner image to scuff easily during finishing and handling.<br>
The use of ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer to prepare suitable substrates for digital offset printing has been disclosed, for example, in EP 1273975 and 0789281. The polymers are typically dispersed in water prior to application to the substrate. However, the polymers are not dispersible in their acid form and must be at least partially neutrali/ed in order to prepare a stable aqueous dispersion with low viscosity and suitable particle size.<br>
Dispersions; of ethylenc-acrylic acid polymers have been prepared using amines such as ammonia and monoethanolamine, alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth rnetal hydroxides and mixtures of amines and strong bases. See U.S. Patent Nos. 3,389,109; 3,872,039; 3,899,389; 4,181,566; 5,206,279; and 5,387,635. The preparation of an aqueous dispersion of polycthylene-co-acrylic acid polymer (20 percent acrylic acid by weight) in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and ethanolamine is described in example 19 of U.S. Patent No. 5,387,635. However, the dispersion of the same polymer prepared in ethanolamine is not stable as evidenced by the observation that the viscosity of the dispersion increased dramatically overnight,<br>
Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for improved paper surface treatments for digital offset printing applications using liquid toner formulations. These treatments should be<br>
stable, improve toner adhesion, have the ability to be applied during paper production, have good durability, and resist pholoyellowing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an embodiment, this invention is an aqueous dispersion comprising one or more ethylcne-acrylic acid polymers and an effective dispersing amount of one or more N,N-dialkylalkanolarniries.<br>
In an embodiment, this invention is a method of preparing an aqueous ethylene-acrylic acid polymer dispersion comprising mixing one or more ethylene-acrylic acid polymers with an effective dispersing amount of one or more MAf-dialkylalkanolamines in an aqueous medium.<br>
In an embodiment, this invention is a method of preparing a substrate for use in electrophotographic or digital offset printing processes comprising applying to the substrate an aqueous dispersion comprising one or more ethylene-acrylic acid polymers and an effective dispersing amount of one or more Af.JV-dialkylalkanolamines.<br>
In an embodiment, this invention is a substrate for use in electrophotographic printing processes comprising one or more ethylene-acrylic acid polymers and one or more MA'-dialkylalkanolamines.<br>
Unlike ammonium neutralized ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers, in which ammonia is released to the air during processing resulting in separation of the polymer from the aqueous phase, no such separation occurs with dispersions neutralized with AT.A^-dialkylalkanolamincs according to this invention due to the higher boiling point (136 °C for N,N-dimethylethanolamine) of the AfiV-dialkylalkanolamines. Additionally, compared to ethylene-acrylic acid dispersions in alkaline metal hydroxides such as KOH, NaOH and LiOH, and the like, the hydroxyl group on the A^AT-dialkylalkanolamines provides improved adhesion of the polymer to the substrate as the hydroxyl group is capable of forming hydrogen bonds as both a donor and acceptor. Furthermore, the hydroxyl functional group allows the invention product to further react with other functional groups such as anhydride, epoxy, isocyanate to form covalent bonds to provide belter adhesion.<br>
