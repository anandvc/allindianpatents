				<td>WATER TREATMENT DEVICES AND CARTRIDGES THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is generally related to the art of water treatment devices and<br>
cartridges for use in the same, and more specifically to preventing recontamination of<br>
treated water by the use of water treatment devices and cartridges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water may contain many different kinds of contaminants including, for example,<br>
particulates, harmful chemicals, and microbiological organisms, such as bacteria,<br>
parasites, protozoa, and viruses. In a variety of circumstances, these contaminants must<br>
be removed before the water can be used. Any harmful contaminants must be removed<br>
from water before it is potable, i.e., fit to consume. Despite modem water treatment<br>
means, the general population is at risk, and in particular infants and persons with<br>
compromised immune systems are at considerable risk.<br>
In the U.S. and other developed countries, municipally treated water typically<br>
includes one or more of the following impurities: suspended solids, bacteria, parasites,<br>
viruses, organic matter, heavy metals, and chlorine. Breakdown and other problems with<br>
water treatment systems sometimes lead to incomplete removal of bacteria and viruses.<br>
In non-developed countries, there are deadly consequences associated with exposure to<br>
contaminated water, as some of them have increasing population densities, increasingly<br>
scarce water resources, and no water treatment utilities. It is common for sources of<br>
drinking water to be in close proximity to human and animal waste, such that<br>
microbiological contamination is a major health concern. As a result of waterborne<br>
microbiological contamination, an estimated six million people die each year, half of<br>
which are children under 5 years of age.<br>
While many different water treatment medias have been developed to remove<br>
these contaminants, these medias are often placed into devices or systems that promote,<br>
or do not adequately guard against, recontamination of treated water. For instance, the<br>
interface between the cartridge and device of many water treatment systems often include<br>
only single barrier between the contaminated water being treated, and the treated water<br>
(See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,735,716,4,857,189,4,948,505, and 5,486,288). Thus, any breach of<br>
the single barrier will most likely lead to recontamination of the treated water being<br>
consumed.<br>
Also, many systems are configured to allow for contamination of the device outlet<br>
when changing water treatment cartridges (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,735,716, 4,857,189,<br>
4,948,505, and 5,486,288). That is, devices are often designed such that contaminated<br>
water directly contacts one or more parts of the device that is responsible for delivering<br>
treated water.<br>
Still further, the barriers of many water treatment cartridges are often oriented<br>
such that they may be easily contaminated by the user, or susceptible to being damaged as<br>
they are packaged, shipped, or otherwise handled (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,735,716,<br>
4,857,189, 4,948,505, 5,695,168, 5,114,572, U.S. Pub. No. 2002/0100720, and WO<br>
01/26772).<br>
Additionally, many water treatment cartridges are designed in a way that fails to<br>
allow the interface to mechanically function to actuate valves seated in the water<br>
treatment devices that the water treatment cartridges are being interfaced with, and those<br>
that do often fail to utilize a mechanical advantage in actuating an inlet and/or an outlet<br>
valve (See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,256,285, 5,607,582, and 5,753,111).<br>
Due to the above concerns and general interest in improving the quality of water,<br>
there is a continuing desire to provide a water treatment system which decreases the<br>
likelihood of re-contaminating treated water. Additionally, there is a desire to provide a<br>
water treatment cartridge that can accomplish the foregoing and is also capable of<br>
mechanically actuating valves.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a cartridge for treating water is provided. The<br>
cartridge is capable of releasably engaging with a water treatment device. The cartridge<br>
includes a housing, an inlet for introducing untreated water into the cartridge, an outlet<br>
port for egress of treated water from the cartridge, and a treatment media for treating<br>
untreated water. The treatment media is in fluid communication with the inlet and the<br>
outlet port. The cartridge further includes a first tube having an inside surface, an outside<br>
surface, a proximal end, and a distal end, where the inside surface and/or the outside<br>
surface is a sealing surface. The cartridge further includes a second tube having an inside<br>
surface, an outside surface, a proximal end, and a distal end, where the inside surface<br>
and/or the outside surface is a sealing surface. The first tube extends from the housing<br>
and surrounds the outlet port. At least a portion of the first tube or the second tube<br>
surrounds the other such that a gap is formed between the first tube and the second tube.<br>
The gap is capable of holding a volume of water.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a device for releasably engaging a water<br>
treatment cartridge as mentioned above is provided. The device includes an outlet<br>
housing having an inside surface and an outside surface. The outlet housing includes at<br>
least one sealing surface. The device further includes a vent housing having an inside<br>
surface and an outside surface. The vent housing includes at least one sealing surface. At<br>
least a portion of the inside surface of the outlet housing forms and defines a treated water<br>
outlet passageway. At least a portion of the outside surface of the outlet housing and the<br>
inside surface of the housing forms and defines an air vent. The device engages with the<br>
cartridge such that the first tube sealingly engages the outlet housing. The second tube<br>
sealingly engages the vent housing such that the inside surface of the first tube and the<br>
inside surface of the outlet housing are in fluid communication. The outside surface of<br>
the first tube and the inside surface of the second tube are in fluid communication.<br>
Other aspects of the invention, including methods of using the cartridge, are<br>
apparent from the detailed description below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "cam surface" refers to the sum of all surfaces that<br>
physically touch a follower of a valve for the purpose of actuating the valve. Cam surface<br>
is further defined and illustrated in U.S. Pat. Application No. 10/424,200 (Fluidic<br>
Cartridges And End Pieces Thereof).<br>
As used herein, the term "coaxial" means a first body being fully within a second<br>
body (e.g., a first cylinder being fully within a second cylinder, a first tube completely<br>
surrounding a second tube, etc.).<br>
As used herein, the term "concentric" means having a common center.<br>
As used herein, the term "fluid " refers to a gas or a liquid.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "sealingly engage(d)" or "sealing engagement" refers<br>
to the meeting of at least two sealing surfaces, or portions thereof, forming a barrier to the<br>
flow of a fluid.<br>
As used herein, the term "sealing surface " refers to a predetermined surface, or<br>
portion thereof, capable of forming a barrier to the flow of a fluid when engaged with<br>
another surface. The surface may include, but is not limited to, a smooth, highly polished<br>
surface or an o-ring that sealingly engages with said polished surface.<br>
As used herein, the term "surround" means to enclose at least a portion.<br>
As used herein, the term "tube" means a hollow elongated structure for conveying<br>
or holding fluids. A tube may be, but is not limited to being cylindrical. For instance, a<br>
tube of the present invention may be in the form of a pentagon, hexagon, octagon, etc.<br>
Other terms used herein are defined in the specification where discussed.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, examples<br>
of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Numerals with the same last two<br>
digits represent the same or similar (not necessarily embodiments) elements throughout<br>
the figures (e.g., 22,122, 222, etc.). Water treatment devices and cartridges of the present<br>
invention may be used where potable water is desired, including, but not limited to,<br>
refrigerators having ice-makers and/or water ports; water stands or coolers; faucetmounted,<br>
counter-top, under-the-sink, and/or whole-house water treatment appliances;<br>
coffee makers, etc.<br>
As shown in Fig. I, an embodiment of a water treatment cartridge 20 comprises a<br>
housing 22, and an inlet 24, an outlet port 26, a first tube 28, a second tube 30, a gap 32,<br>
and a water treatment media 34. The housing 22, as shown in an embodiment of the<br>
invention, may be cylindrical, however, it may be various shapes and sizes. The housing<br>
22 may be made from one or more of a variety of materials, including, but not limited to,<br>
one or a combination of plastics, metal and alloys thereof, fiberglass, etc. The housing 22<br>
may consist of a cap at the end(s) of formed treatment media (e.g., 34), or may form a<br>
well-defined compartment that holds loose treatment media.<br>
The inlet 24, as shown in an embodiment of the invention, may be a portion of<br>
exposed media 34 capped by the housing 22 both ends. That is, water may enter the<br>
cartridge 20 through the exposed portion of the media 34. As shown in Fig. 2, the inlet<br>
224 may optionally be a circular opening and located at the second end of the cartridge<br>
220, opposite the location of the outlet port 26. The inlet 224 may have optionally been<br>
placed on the side or the first end of the cartridge 220.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the outlet port 26 may be a circular opening, concentric<br>
and coaxial with the longitudinal axis 36 of the cartridge 20. The inlet 24 and outlet port<br>
26 may be of varying size and oriented in any manner that best serves the application.<br>
Thus, the inlet 24 and outlet port 26 can be oriented in the same proximity (e.g., sharing<br>
the same opening), in near proximity (e.g., sharing the same surface or end), or in distant<br>
proximities from one another (e.g., located at opposite ends).<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the first tube 28 and second tube 30 extend from the housing<br>
22 such that the first tube 28 surrounds the outlet port 26, and the second tube 30<br>
surrounds the first tube 28, such that a gap 32 is formed between the outside surface of<br>
the first tube 28 and the inside surface of the second tube 30, where the top of the housing<br>
22 acts as an uninterrupted floor 38 (that is, a floor without openings) for the gap 32. The<br>
first and second tubes 28 and 30 may extend from the housing 22 in such a manner that<br>
no leak path is created between the proximal ends of the first 28 or second 30 tubes and<br>
the housing 22. That is, water may only escape over the distal ends of either the first 28<br>
or second 30 tubes (that is, the proximal portion of the gap 32 is open), otherwise, the<br>
water may be held in the gap 32 for an extended period of time (depending on other<br>
conditions) because there is no other means of escaping (that is, the distal portion of the<br>
gap 32 is water tight). The gap 32 may be capable of holding some volume of water<br>
when the cartridge 20 is not sealingly engaged to a device (as discussed below),<br>
preferably from about 0.1 milliliters (herein, "ml") to about 6 ml, more preferably from<br>
about 1.6 ml to about 4.5 ml, and most preferably from about 2.2 ml to about 3 ml.<br>
Additionally, the gap 32 may be capable of holding some volume of water when the<br>
cartridge 20 is sealingly engaged to a device (as discussed below), preferably from about<br>
0.1 ml to about 5.5 ml, more preferably from about 0.5 ml to about 3 ml, and most<br>
preferably from about 0.8 ml to about 1.2 ml.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the first tube 28 may be circular, and may concentrically and<br>
coaxially surround the outlet port 26, but may surround the outlet port 26 in any manner.<br>
The first tube 28 may be made from one or more of a variety of materials, including, but<br>
not limited to, one or a combination of plastics, metal and alloys thereof, fiberglass, etc.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the first tube 28 acts as an uninterrupted extension of the outlet port<br>
26. The inside or outside surface of the first tube 28 may be a sealing surface 44, and may<br>
comprise one or more o-rings, or other such sealing surface, and may be supported by one<br>
or more ribs 40 (See Fig. 16). As illustrated by an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
sealing surface 44 of the first tube 28 is a portion its inner surface that is highly polished<br>
for sealingly engaging with an o-ring. When the first tube 28 is without an o-ring, there is<br>
no chance of nicking or tearing, or in some other way breaching the integrity of the o-ring<br>
(packaging, shipping, consumer handling, etc.). Also, when the sealing surface of the<br>
first tube 28 is the inside surface, the diameter of the first tube 28 may be kept at a<br>
distance that prevents the average consumer from being able to touch the sealing surface,<br>
causing a scratch which might allow for a leak, or touching the sealing surface with<br>
contaminated hands, resulting in contaminated water, etc. When the sealing surface of<br>
the first tube 28 is the outside surface, the gap 32 between the first tube 28 and second<br>
tube 30 may be kept a distance that prevents the occurrence of these concerns.<br>
Additionally, the height of the first tube 28 in relation to its sealing surface 44<br>
may be important in protecting the sealing surface of the first tube 28. That is, the sealing<br>
surface of the first tube 28, whether located on the inner or outer surface, may be oriented<br>
on the first tube 28 such that some portion of the first tube 28 extends beyond the sealing<br>
surface to protect it. The first tube 28 may preferably extend beyond the distal portion of<br>
the sealing surface 44 by distance LI, preferably from about 0.1 centimeters (herein,<br>
"cm") to about 2 cm, more preferably from about 0.2 cm to about 1 cm, and most<br>
preferably from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm. Also, the height of the second tube 30 may<br>
protect the sealing surface 44 of the first tube 28 by extending beyond the sealing surface<br>
44 of the first tube 28 and beyond the distal end of the first tube 28 itself.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 5-A and 5-B, the second tube 30 may be circular, and may<br>
concentrically and coaxially surround the first tube 28 and or the outlet port 26, but may<br>
surround the first tube 28 and or the outlet port 26 in any manner. The second tube 30<br>
may be made from one or more of a variety of materials, including, but not limited to, one<br>
or a combination of plastics, metal and alloys thereof, fiberglass, etc. The inside or<br>
outside surface of the second tube 30 may be a sealing surface 46. As shown in an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the sealing surface 46 is a portion of the inner surface of the<br>
second tube 30 and is highly polished for sealingly engaging with an o-ring. The second<br>
tube 30 may or may not comprise one or more o-rings, or other such sealing surface, and<br>
may or may not be supported by one or more ribs. As shown in Fig. 6-A, the second tube<br>
6A30 need not extend from the housing 22, but may extend outward from the first tube<br>
28, such that the floor 6A38 of the gap 6A32 is formed as part of the second tube 6A30 as<br>
it extends from the first tube 28. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 6-B, the second tube<br>
6B30 may extend inward from the first tube 28. As shown in Fig. 7, the second tube 730<br>
may also act as a cam surface 42, as described in U.S. Pat. Application No. 10/424,200<br>
and as further described and illustrated below (See Fig. 15).<br>
When the second tube 30 is without an o-ring, there is no chance of nicking or<br>
tearing, or in some other way compromising the integrity of the o-ring. Also, when the<br>
sealing surface 46 of the second rube 30 is the inside surface, the diameter of the second<br>
tube 30 may be kept at a distance which keeps the gap 32 a distance that prevents the<br>
average consumer from being able to touch the sealing surface, causing a scratch which<br>
might allow for a leak, or touching the sealing surface 46 with contaminated hands,<br>
resulting in contaminated water, etc. When the outside surface of the second tube 30 is<br>
without an o-ring, and is not a sealing surface, it may be more readily used as a cam<br>
surface (e.g., 42) as described above.<br>
Additionally, the height of the second tube 30 in relation to the sealing surface 46<br>
of the second tube 30 may be important in protecting the sealing surface 46. That is, the<br>
sealing surface 46 of the second tube 30, whether located on the inner or outer surface,<br>
may be oriented on the second tube 30 such that some portion of the second tube 30<br>
extends beyond the sealing surface 46 to protect it. The second tube 30 may preferably<br>
extend beyond the distal portion of its sealing surface 46 a distance L2 (See Fig 5-B),<br>
preferably from about 0.1 cm to about 1.5 cm, more preferably from about 0.2 cm to<br>
about 0.9 cm, and most preferably from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm. Further, as shown<br>
in Fig. 8, the height of the first tube 828 may also protect the sealing surface 846 of the<br>
second tube 830 by extending beyond the sealing surface 846 of the second tube 830 and<br>
beyond the distal end of the second tube 830 itself.<br>

preferably from about 1.2 cm to about 1.4 cm. The distance L5 (the height of the second<br>
tube 30), from the first end of the housing 22 to the distal end of the second tube 30 may<br>
preferably be from about 0.5 cm to about 3 cm, more preferably from about 0.7 cm to<br>

from about 0 cm to about 1 cm, more preferably from about 0.1 cm to about 0.5 cm, and<br>
most preferably from about 0.2 cm to about 0.3 cm. The distance L7 (the height of the<br>
second tube 30), from the proximal end of the first tube 28 to the distal end of the second<br>
tube 30 may preferably be from about 0.5 cm to about 3 cm, more preferably from about<br>
0,7 cm to about 2.2 cm, and most preferably from about 1 cm to about 1.5 cm. The<br>
distance L8 (the height of the first tube 28), from the proximal end of the second tube 30<br>
to the distal end of the first tube 28 may preferably be from about 0.5 cm to about 3 cm,<br>
more preferably from about 0.9 cm to about 2 cm, and most preferably from about 1 cm<br>
to about 1.5 cm.<br>
The distance L9, from the longitudinal axis 36 of the cartridge 20 to the inner<br>
surface first tube 28 may preferably be from about 0.3 cm to about 1.5 cm, more<br>
preferably from about 0.4 cm to about 1 cm, and most preferably from about 0.6 cm to<br>
about 0.8 cm. The first tube 28 may preferably have an inside diameter L10, from about<br>
0.5 cm to about 3 cm, more preferably from about 0.9 cm to about 2.2 cm, and most<br>
preferably from about 1.2 cm to about 1.5 cm.<br>
The distance Lll, from the longitudinal axis 36 of the cartridge 20 to the inner<br>
surface of the second tube 30 may preferably be from about .5 cm to about 2.5 cm, more<br>
preferably from about 0.8 cm to about 2 cm, and most preferably from about 1 cm to<br>
about 1.3 cm. The second tube 30 may preferably have a diameter LI2, from about 1 cm<br>
to about 5 cm, more preferably from about 1.7 cm to about 4 cm, and most preferably<br>
from about 2 cm to about 2.5 cm. The gap 32 may have an inner diameter of preferably<br>
from about 0.5 cm to about 3.5 cm, more preferably from about 1 cm to about 2.5 cm, and<br>
most preferably from about 1.5 cm to about 2 cm, and an outer diameter of preferably<br>
from about 1 cm to about 5 cm, more preferably from about 1.5 cm to about 4 cm, and<br>
most preferably from about 2 cm to about 2.6 cm. The greatest distance LI3, between the<br>
outside surface of the first tube 28 and the inside surface of the second tube 30 may<br>
preferably be from about 0.1 cm to about 2.5 cm, more preferably from about 0.2 cm to<br>
about 1.2 cm, and most preferably from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm.<br>
The distance LI4, from the first end of the housing 22 to the distal portion of the<br>
sealing surface 44 of the first tube 28 may preferably be from about 0.4 cm to about 2 cm,<br>
more preferably from about 0.5 cm to about 1.5 cm, and most preferably from about 0.8<br>
cm to about 1 cm. The distance LI5, from the first end of the housing 22 to the distal<br>
portion of the sealing surface 46 of the second tube 30 may preferably be from about 0.4<br>
cm to about 2.5 cm, more preferably from about 0.5 cm to about 2 cm, and most<br>
preferably from about 0.7 cm to about 1 cm.<br>
It may be desirable to, for reasons of cartridge 20 compactness, limit the height of<br>
the first and second tubes 28 and 30 as much as possible while maintaining a sealing<br>
surface 44 and 46 on each tube. The less the height of the tubes 28 and 30 for engaging a<br>
device are, the greater the height the housing 22 or the treatment media 34 may be per<br>
fixed distance (See U.S. Pat. Application No. 10/424,200). Thus, it is foreseeable that the<br>
first tube 28 and the second tube 30 may be the same minimum height. Additionally, it is<br>
foreseeable that each of the sealing surfaces 44 and 46 may extend from the first end of<br>
the housing 22 the same distance (thus, each of the tubes 28 and 30 would extend beyond<br>
each of the sealing surfaces 44 and 46, respectively, the same distance).<br>
As mentioned above, the height of the first tube 28 may be used to protect its<br>
sealing surface 44 and the sealing surface 46 of the second tube 30. Likewise, the height<br>
of the second tube 30 may be used to protect its sealing surface 46 and the sealing surface<br>
44 of the first tube 28. Thus, the relationship between first tube 28 and second tube 30<br>
height may be important. For instance, the second tube 30 may have a height preferably<br>
from about 1 time to about 2.5 times, more preferably from about 1.1 times to about 2<br>
times, and most preferably from about 1.2 times to about 1.3 times the height of the first<br>
tube 28 (e.g., if the second tube 30 is 1.1 times the height of the first tube 28, and the first<br>
tube 28 is 1.2 cm high, then the second tube 30 will be 1.3 cm high). Conversely, the first<br>
tube 28 may have a height preferably from about 1 time to about 2.5 times, more<br>
preferably from about 1.1 times to about 2 times, and most preferably from about 1.2<br>
times to about 1.3 times the height of the second tube 30.<br>
The distal end of the second tube 30 may extend from the first end of the cartridge<br>
housing 22 preferably from about 1 time to about 2.5 times, more preferably from about<br>
1.1 times to about 2 times, and most preferably from about 1.2 times to about 1.3 times<br>
that of the distal end of the first tube 28 (e.g., if the distal end of the second tube 30<br>
extends 1.1 times that of the distal end of the first tube 28 from the cartridge housing 22,<br>
and the distal end of the first tube 28 extends 1.2 cm from the cartridge housing 22, then<br>
the distal end of the second tube 30 will extend 1.3 cm from the cartridge housing 22).<br>
Conversely, the distal end of the first tube 28 may extend from the first end of the<br>
cartridge housing 22 preferably from about 1 time to about 2.5 times, more preferably<br>
from about 1.1 times to about 2 times, and most preferably from about 1.2 times to about<br>
1.3 times that of the distal end of the second tube 30.<br>
The distal portion of the sealing surface 46 of the second tube 30 may extend from<br>
the cartridge housing 22 preferably from about 1 time to about 3 times, more preferably<br>
from about 1.1 times to about 2 times, and most preferably from about 1.3 times to about<br>
1.4 times that of the distal portion of the sealing surface 44 of the first tube 28 (e.g., if the<br>
distal portion of the sealing surface 46 of the second tube 30 extends 1.1 times that of the<br>
distal portion of the sealing surface 44 of the first tube 28 from the cartridge housing 22,<br>
and the distal portion of the sealing surface 44 of the first tube 28 extends 0.9 cm from the<br>
cartridge housing 22, then the distal portion of the sealing surface 46 of the second tube<br>
30 will extend 1 cm from the cartridge housing 22). Conversely, the distal portion of the<br>
sealing surface 46 of the first tube 28 may extend from the cartridge housing 22<br>
preferably from about 1 time to about 3 times, more preferably from about l.l times to<br>
about 2 times, and most preferably from about 1.3 times to about 1.4 times that of the<br>
distal portion of the sealing surface 46 of the second tube 30.<br>
At least one sealing surface of the second tube 30 may extend from the cartridge<br>
housing 22 preferably from about 1 time to about 3 times, more preferably from about 1.1<br>
times to about 2 times, and most preferably from about 1.3 times to about 1.4 times that<br>
of at least one sealing surface of the first tube 28. Conversely, at least one sealing surface<br>
of the first tube 28 may extend from the cartridge housing 22 preferably from about 1<br>
time to about 3 times, more preferably from about 1.1 times to about 2 times, and most<br>
preferably from about 1.3 times to about 1.4 times that of at least one sealing surface of<br>
the second tube 30.<br>
Water treatment media 34 may be contained within the cartridge housing 22, and<br>
may function in a variety of ways as known in the art, including, but not limited to, the<br>
removal or neutralization of contaminants such as by size exclusion, electrolysis,<br>
absorption, adsorption, oxidation, reduction, chemical disinfection, ion exchange, etc.<br>
Examples of contaminants include microorganisms, viruses, bacteria, pathogens,<br>
protozoa, organic matter, inorganic material, etc. Also, beneficial additives such as<br>
flavorants, vitamins, minerals, nutrients, etc. may also be added. Examples of suitable<br>
water treatment medias known in the art are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,167,225,<br>
2,335,458, 4,172,796, 4,493,772, 4,764,274, 4,025,438, 4,094,779, and 6,337,015. For<br>
example, water treatment medias may include, but are not limited to, one or a<br>
combination of carbon (e.g., activated carbon, such as a tube of porous carbon, or a block<br>
of porous carbon, or carbon powder sintered with a plastic binder or the like), ion<br>
exchange media (e.g., in the form of resin beads, flat filtration membranes, fibrous<br>
filtration structures, etc.), zeolite particles or coatings (e.g., silver loaded), polyethylene,<br>
or charge-modified melt-blown or micro-fiber glass webs, alumina, diatomaceous earth,<br>
etc. The water treatment media 34 of this invention may comprise other conventional<br>
water treatment medias as described in U.S. Pat. App, Nos. 09/935,810, 09/935,962,<br>
09/628,632, 09/832,581, 09/832,580, 09/736,749, 09/574,456, 09/564,919, and<br>
09/347,223.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the housing 1022 may additionally comprise a channel 48, a<br>
notch 50, a cam 52, a shoulder 54, and an o-ring 56 as described in U.S. Pat. Nos,<br>
5,525,214,5,527,451, 5,928,504, and 6,241,103.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the cartridge 20 may be used in a water treatment device 60<br>
comprising an inlet housing 62, a pressure vessel 64, a vent housing 66, and an outlet<br>
housing 68. A water treatment cartridge and device may collectively be referred to as a<br>
"water treatment system". A first 70 and second 72 o-ring may surround each of the<br>
inner or outer surfaces of the outlet 68 and vent 66 housings, respectively. These o-rings<br>
70 and 72 may be protected from the user, such that the first 70 and second 72 o-rings<br>
may be oriented within the device 60 such that they are out of reach of the average user<br>
so that he/she may not damage or contaminate the o-rings 70 and 72. The first tube 28 of<br>
the cartridge 20 may sealingly engage the outlet housing 68 and the second tube 30 may<br>
sealingly engage a vent housing 66. The first tube 28 may fit over or into the outlet<br>
housing 68, such that the inside of the first tube 28 and the inside of the outlet housing 68<br>
are in fluid communication. Likewise, the second tube 30 may fit over or into the vent<br>
housing 66, such that the inside of the second tube 30 and the inside of the vent housing<br>
66 are in fluid communication.<br>
The function of the water treatment device 60 and cartridge 20 will now be<br>
described. Once the cartridge 20 is sealingly engaged to the device 60 as shown in Fig.<br>
11, the pressure vessel 64 may be secured (e.g., friction fitted, threadably fitted, bolted,<br>
screwed, fastened, snap fitted, latched, etc.) to the device 60 such that contaminated water<br>
enters the system through the inlet housing 62 and fills the pressure vessel 64, surrounds<br>
the cartridge housing 22 and the outside surface of the second tube 30, and enters the<br>
cartridge 20 via the treatment media 34. Water is treated as it moves through the<br>
treatment media 34, and then exits the cartridge 20 through the outlet port 26. Treated<br>
water is forced along the inside surface of the first tube 28, unable to penetrate the first oring<br>
70, and is forced through the outlet housing 68.<br>
There are several situations that might occur in any water treatment system that<br>
allow contaminated water to be mixed with treated water. The cartridge 20 of the present<br>
invention, however, protects against many of such potential problems. For example, the<br>
contaminated water, as it fills the pressure vessel 64, challenges the integrity of the<br>
second o-ring 72. If there is a tear in the second o-ring 72, or the second tube 30 fails to<br>
sealingly engage the vent housing 66, the first tube 28 being sealingly engaged to the<br>
outlet housing 68 will act to prevent contaminated water from penetrating the outlet<br>
housing 68 and the treated water. Before contaminated water that passed by the second<br>
o-ring 72 challenges the integrity of the first o-ring 70, the gap 32 will be filled with<br>
contaminated water. The gap 32 will act to safely hold the contaminated water,<br>
depending on the size of the gap 32 and the volume of contaminated water leaking past<br>
the second o-ring 72. The water treatment device 60 may also be designed to prevent, or<br>
lessen the extent by which contaminated water challenges the integrity of the first o-ring<br>
70 by venting contaminated water that overfills the gap 32 safely away from the treated<br>
water supply.<br>
Contaminated water might be mixed with treated water when changing the water<br>
treatment cartridge 20. As shown in Fig. 12, in a cartridge 1220 and device 1260 that are<br>
different from the ones previously described and not examples of embodiments of the<br>
invention, or alternatives thereof, the cartridge 1220 has only a first tube 28 between<br>
contaminated water and the outlet port 26. Such will most certainly contribute to the<br>
recontamination of treated water. For instance, as shown in Fig. 13, when changing the<br>
water treatment cartridge 1220, after the pressure vessel 64 has been removed, water<br>
adheres around the area where sealing engagement occurred, such that when the cartridge<br>
1220 is removed, contaminated water 74 drips and runs from the outside surface of the<br>
outlet housing 68, even rolling to the inside surface of the outlet housing 68. Thus, when<br>
a new cartridge is inserted, contaminated water 74 below the site of sealing engagement<br>
will be pushed through the outlet housing 68 where it is able to re-contaminate already<br>
treated water. However, in the water treatment device 60 and cartridge 20 previously<br>
illustrated in Fig. 11, such collection of water occurs outside of the second tube 30, such<br>
that the first tube 28 and the outlet housing 68 should remain free from contact with<br>
contaminated water. Any contaminated water that is trapped by the sealing engagement<br>
of a new water treatment cartridge 20 may rest in the gap 32.<br>
As shown in Figs. 14-A and 14-B, the cartridge 1420 may also have a third tube 76<br>
which sealingly engages a plug housing 78 of the pressure vessel 1464. The plug housing<br>
78 may be located on the pressure vessel 1464 such that an opening 80 through the<br>
pressure vessel 1464 is formed. An o-ring 82 may surround the plug housing 78, such that<br>
the third tube 76 of the cartridge 1420 may seal the opening 80 of the pressure vessel<br>
1464. Thus, if contaminated water entered the device 1460, and no cartridge 1420 was<br>
inserted, contaminated water would egress through the opening 80. However, if the<br>
cartridge 1420 comprising a third tube 76 was inserted into the pressure vessel 1464, the<br>
pressure vessel 1464 would fill with contaminated water as described above. The third<br>
tube 76 and the plug housing 78 would prevent one from mistakenly operating the water<br>
treatment device 1460 without a water treatment cartridge 1420 in place.<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, and as mentioned above, a portion of the second tube 30 of<br>
the cartridge 20 may function as a cam surface (e.g., 42), such that it contacts and<br>
actuates a follower 84 of a valve 86 as the cartridge 20 is inserted into the device 1560,<br>
such that the valve 86 is actuated. The term "actuate" or "actuated" refers to mechanical<br>
action or motion and/or maintaining a position against a force (e.g., moving a follower or<br>
holding a follower in an open position).<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, the cartridge 1620 may also be used in other devices 1660<br>
utilizing a pressure vessel 1664. However, the cartridge 20 of the present invention need<br>
not be used in a device having a pressure vessel.<br>
The present invention may additionally include information that will communicate<br>
to the consumer, by words and/or by pictures, that use of the present invention will<br>
provide benefits that include assuring the integrity of a treated water supply, and this<br>
information may include the claim of superiority over other water treatment products. In<br>
a highly desirable variation, the information may include that use of the invention<br>
protects against re-contamination of already treated water. Accordingly, the use of<br>
packages in association with information that will communicate to the consumer, by<br>
words and or by pictures, that use of the invention will provide the particular and related<br>
benefits as previously mentioned. The information can include, e.g., advertising in all of<br>
the usual media, as well as statements and icons on the package, or the filter itself, to<br>
inform the consumer.<br>
All documents cited are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the<br>
citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with<br>
respect to the present invention.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and<br>
modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and<br>
modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
