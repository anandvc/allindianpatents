The following Table 1 sets forth examples of processes and compositions where the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide components of the invention are utilized. Each of the useful ingredients set forth in the cited U.S. Patent and patent application references, including the examples thereof is usable in the practice of the invention, and hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As used herein olfactory effective amount is understood to mean the amount of compound in flavor compositions, oral care compositions, nasal care compositions, skin care compositions, hair and scalp care compositions, cosmetic compositions and other consumable materials as defined supra, the individual component will contribute to its particular olfactory characteristics, but the flavor, taste and aroma effect on the overall composition will be the sum of the effects of each of the flavor ingredients. As used herein taste effects include bitterness and tingling effects. Thus the compounds of the invention can be used to alter the taste characteristics of the flavor composition by modifying the taste reaction contributed by another ingredient in the<br>
composition. The amount will vary depending on many factors including other ingredients, their relative amounts and the effect that is desired.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for enhancing or modifying the salt flavor of a food through the incorporation of an organoleptically acceptable level of the compounds described herein. The compounds can be used individually or in combination with other salt enhancing compounds of the present invention. In addition, the salt enhancing materials of the present invention can be used in combination with other salt enhancing compositions known in the art, including but not limited to cetylpyridium chloride, bretylium tosylate, various polypeptides, mixtures of calcium salts of ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and potassium chloride, as described in various U.S. Patents 4,997,672; 5,288,510; 6,541,050 and U.S. Patent Application 2003/0091721.<br>
The salt taste enhancing compounds of the present invention may be employed to enhance the perceived salt taste of any salts used in food or beverage products. The preferred salt taste to be enhanced by the compounds of the present invention is that of sodium chloride, primarily because of the discovery that ingestion of large amounts of sodium may have adverse effects on humans and the resultant desirability of reducing salt content while retaining salt taste.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the present invention may also be employed to enhance the perceived salt taste of known salty tasting compounds which may be used as salt substitutes. Such compounds include cationic amino acids and low molecular weight dipeptides. Specific examples of these compounds are arginine hydrochloride, lysine hydrochloride and lysine-ornithine hydrochloride. These compounds exhibit a salty taste but are typically useful only at low concentrations since they exhibit a bitter flavor at higher concentrations. Thus, it is feasible to reduce the sodium chloride content of a food or beverage product by first formulating a food or beverage with less sodium chloride than is necessary to achieve a desired salt taste and then adding to said food or beverage the compounds of the present invention in an amount sufficient to potentiate the salt taste of said salted food or beverage to reach said desired taste. In addition, the sodium chloride content may be further reduced by substituting a salty-tasting cationic amino acid, a low molecular weight dipeptide or mixtures thereof for at least a portion of the salt.<br>
The salt enhancing level of the compounds of the present invention range from about 100 parts per billion to about 100 parts per million; preferably from about 0.1 parts per million to about 50 parts per million; and most preferably from about 0.5 parts per million to about 10 parts per million when incorporated into the foodstuff.<br>
The term "foodstuff as used herein includes both solid and liquid ingestible materials for man or animals, which materials usually do, but need not, have nutritional value. Thus, foodstuffs include food products, such as, meats, gravies, soups, convenience foods, malt, alcoholic and other beverages, milk and dairy products, seafood, including fish, crustaceans, mollusks and the like, candies, vegetables, cereals, soft drinks, snacks, dog and cat foods, other veterinary products and the like.<br>
The level of use of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide components of the invention in products is greater than 10 parts per billion, generally provided at a level of from about 50 parts per billion to about 200 parts per million in the finished product, more preferably from about 100 parts per billion to about 100 parts per million by weight.<br>
The usage level of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide components of the invention varies depending on the product in which the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide components of the invention are employed. For example, alcoholic beverages the usage level is from about 0.5 to about 25 parts per million, preferably from about 2 to about 10 and most preferably from about 5 to about 10 parts per million by weight. Non-alcoholic beverages are flavored at levels of from about 25 parts per billion to about 2 parts per million, preferably from about 100 parts per billion to about 0.5 parts per million and in highly preferred situations of from about 150 to about 400 parts per billion. Snack foods can be advantageously flavored using the mixtures of C|o-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide components of the invention at levels of from about 5 to about 250 parts per million, preferably from about 25 to about 200 and most preferably from about 35 to about 75 parts per million by weight.<br>
When the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide components of the invention are used in a flavoring composition, they can be combined with conventional flavoring materials or adjuvants. Such co-ingredients or flavor adjuvants are well known in the art for such use and have been extensively described in the literature. Requirements of such adjuvant materials are:<br>
 (1) that they be non-reactive with the components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention (2) that they be organoleptically compatible with the components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention whereby the flavor of the ultimate consumable material to which the components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention are added is not detrimentally affected by the use of the adjuvant; and (3) that they be ingestible acceptable and thus nontoxic or otherwise non-deleterious.

The components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention or compositions incorporating them, as mentioned above, can be combined with one or more vehicles or carriers for adding them to the particular product. Vehicles can be water-soluble or oil-soluble edible or otherwise suitable materials such as triacetin, vegetable oil, triethyl citrate, ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, water and the like. Carriers include materials such as gum arabic, carrageenan, xanthan gum, guar gum and the like.<br>
Components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention prepared according to the invention can be incorporated with the carriers by conventional means such as spray-drying, extrusion, drum-drying and the like. Such carriers can also include materials for coacervating the components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention to provide encapsulated products, as set forth supra. When the carrier is an emulsion, the flavoring composition can also contain emulsifiers such as mono- and diglycerides or fatty acids and the like. With these carriers or vehicles, the desired physical form of the compositions can be prepared.<br>
The quantity of the components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention utilized should be sufficient to impart the desired flavor characteristic to the product, but on the other hand, the use of an excessive amount of the components of the mixtures of C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamides of the invention is not only wasteful and uneconomical, but in some instances, too large a quantity may unbalance the flavor or other organoleptic properties of the product consumed. The quantity used will vary depending upon the ultimate foodstuff; the amount and type of flavor initially present in the foodstuff; the further process or treatment steps to which the foodstuff will be subjected; regional and other preference factors; the type of storage, if any, to which the product will be subjected; and the preconsumption treatment such as baking, frying and so on, given to the product by the ultimate consumer. Accordingly, the<br>
terminology "effective amount" and "sufficient amount" is understood in the context of the present invention to be quantitatively adequate to alter the flavor of the foodstuff.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, dried Piper longum Linn or Piperpeepuloides fruit at location 10<br>
is transported via conveyor 11 into milling apparatus 12 wherein it is milled to a particle size in<br>
the range of from about 300 microns to about 800 microns. The milled particles are conveyed via<br>
line 13 into extractor 14onto supported screens 15 (acting as extraction column stages). The<br>
temperature profiles and rates of heat transfer in extractor (percolator) 14 are controlled by means<br>
of fluid pumped into heating jacket 22 entering at inlet 24 and exiting at outlet 23. Extraction<br>
solvent (e.g., n-hexane) flows from solvent supply vessel 16 past control valve 18 through line 17<br>
into extractor (percolator) 14, with the extraction solvent being recirculated through the supported<br>
screens and through line 19 past valve 20 using circulating solvent pump 21. After a period of<br>
time in the range of 10-20 hours, with the solvent:solids ratio being from about 2.75:1 to 3.25:1<br>
the operation of the pump 21 is temporarily discontinued while the liquid extract containing<br>
extracted product is removed from the extractor via line 25 past control valve 26 into extract<br>
holding tank 90. Then, for a second time, extraction solvent, such as n-hexane, flows from<br>
solvent supply vessel 16 past control valve 18 through line \1_ into extractor (percolator) 14, with<br>
the extraction solvent being recirculated through the supported screens and through line 19 past<br>
valve 20 using circulating solvent pump 21. After a period of time in the range of 10-20 hours,<br>
with the solvent:solids ratio being from about 1.75:1 to 2.25:1 the operation of the pump 21 is<br>
temporarily discontinued while the liquid extract containing extracted product is removed from<br>
the extractor via line 25 past control valve 26 into extract holding tank 90. Then, for a third time,<br>
extraction solvent, such as n-hexane, flows from solvent supply vessel 16 past control valve 18<br>
through line 12 into extractor, also known as percolator, 14. with the extraction solvent being<br>
recirculated through the supported screens and through line 19 past valve 20 using circulating<br>
solvent pump 21- After a period of time in the range of 10-20 hours, with the solvent:solids ratio<br>
being from about 0.75:1 to 1.25:1 the operation of the pump 21 is discontinued while the liquid<br>
extract containing extracted product is removed from the extractor via line 25 past control valve<br>
26 into extract holding tank 90. The combined extracts in holding vessel 90 is then passed<br>
through line 27 past control valve 28 into filtration apparatus 29 where precipitate is discarded via<br>
conveyor 30 to disposal means 31 and filtrate passes through line 32 past control valve 33 into<br>
evaporator 34 On operation of evaporator 34, overhead solvent vapor is recycled via line 35 past<br>
control valve 36 back to solvent supply vessel 16. Concentrated extract is passed through line 37<br>
past control valve 38 into storage vessel 40. In the alternative, concentrated extract is passed<br>
through line 41 past control valve 42 into fractional distillation column 43 where residue is removed through line 44 and passed into disposal means 45 and overhead distillate (containing C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide mixtures of the invention) is passed through line 46 and heat exchanger 47 past control valve 48 into product vessel 53 through line 49 past control valve 50; and into 'discarded fraction' vessel 54 through line 51 past control valve 52. In the alternative, when the circulating extraction solvent through extractor 14 is ethanol, concentrated extract is passed through line 55 past control valve 56into liquid-liquid multistage extraction column 57 (equipped for n-hexane: ethanol exchange) while simultaneously passing n-hexane from storage vessel 58 through line 59 past control valve 60 into multi-stage extractor 57 countercurrent to the flow of the concentrated extract entering the multistage extractor 57 from line 34- Ethanol fraction exits from extractor 57 via line 71 into ethanol fraction storage vessel 72. n-Hexane extract exiting the extractor 52 through line 61 past control valve 62 is concentrated in evaporator 63. Hexane solvent exiting evaporator 63 passes through line 67 past valve 66 into vessel 68 from which the solvent is recycled via line 69 past control valve 70 into an alternative solvent supply vessel (which is separate from a solvent supply vessel that would be the source of ethanol supply) 16 Simultaneously, concentrated hexane extract exits from evaporator 63 via line 64 past control valve 65 into distillation column 43 where residue is removed through line 44 and passed into disposal means 45 and overhead distillate, containing C10-C11-E2,E4-alkadienamide mixtures of the invention, is passed through line 46 and heat exchanger 47 past control valve 48 into product vessel 53 through line 49 past control valve 50; and into discarded fraction vessel 54 through line 51 past control valve 52.<br>
