Catalysts suitable for the oxidation of ethane to ethylene and/or acetic acid and/or for the oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid are well known. J. Catal. 52, 116-132 (1978), for example, discloses mixed oxide catalysts comprising molybdenum, vanadium and another transition metal, preferably niobium, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The catalysts may be supported on aJpha-aliimina. The alumina-supported catalysts are prepared by impregnation followed by evaporation. Further catalysts for use in the production of acetic acid by the oxidation of ethane and ethylene are known in the art from, for example, US 4,250,346, EP-A-1043064, WO 99/20592, DE 196 30 832 and WO 00/14047.<br>
US Patent No. 4,250,346 discloses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in a gas phase reaction at relatively high levels of conversion, selectivity and productivity to ethylene at a temperature of less than about 550°C using as a catalyst a composition comprising the elements molybdenum, X and Y in the ratio MoaXbYc wherein X is Cr, Mn, Nb, Ta, Ti, V and/or W, and preferably Mn, Mb, V and/or W; Y is<br>

Preferably, the slurry is formed by mixing one or more solutions comprising the one or more metal components with alpha-alumina support particles or an alpha-alumina support precursor. The one or more solutions comprise soluble or insoluble compounds and/or complexes of the metal components of the catalyst. The prepared solution(s) are mixed with alpha-alumina or a suitable alpha-alumina precursor, and, if required, other support materials or suitable precursors to form the slurry.<br>
Preferably, separate solutions comprising each metal component are prepared by dissolving sufficient quantities of soluble compounds and/or dispersing any insoluble compounds or quantities of said compounds so as to provide a desired gram-atom ratio of the metal components in the catalyst composition. Where the catalyst comprises more than one metal'component, the respective solutions are then mixed to form a single solution comprising the desired quantities of metal components.<br>
The alpha-alumina support particles or alpha-alumina precursor (and, if required, other support materials or precursors) may then be added to the resulting<br><br>
solution.<br>
Alternatively, the mixing of the solutions comprising each metal and the alpha-alumina support particles or alpha-alumina precursor (and, if required, other support materials or precursors) may be performed simultaneously.<br>
The one or more solutions comprising the metal components may be prepared from any suitable metal compounds and/or complexes. The one or more solutions are preferably aqueous solutions having a pH in the range from 1 to 12, preferably from 2 to 8, at a temperature of from 20° to 100°C.<br>
Suitable molybdenum-containing compounds, for example, include, molybdenum acetates, oxalates glycolates, oxides and halides. More preferably molybdenum may be introduced in the form of ammonium salts, such as ammonium heptamolybdate.<br>
Suitable vanadium-containing compounds, for example, include, vanadium acetates, oxalates, tartrates, oxides and sulphates. More preferably vanadium may be introduced in the form of ammonium salts, such as ammonium metavanadate.<br>
Suitable niobium-containing compounds, for example, include, niobium haJides and oxalates. Preferably niobium may be introduced in the form of ammonium salts, such as ammonium niobium oxalate.<br>
Suitable gold-containing compounds, for example, include, gold acetates and halides.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the slurry of the one or more metal components and alpha-alumina support particles or an'alpha-alumina support precursor, is spray-dried. Any suitable spray-drying techniques may be used. An overview of spray-drying can be found in a suitable handbook, such as, for example, K. Masters, Spray Drying Handbook, 1985, published by John Wiley and Sons.<br>
In general, the outlet temperature of the spray-dryer should be high enough to ensure solvent removal, for example, at least 100°C where water is used as the solvent, to ensure water removal. In addition, where the supported catalyst composition is to be calcined, it is ^referred that the maximum inlet temperature of the spray-dryer used should not exceed the calcination temperature.<br>
Suitably, spray-drying may be performed at an inlet temperature of between 250°C and 350°C, for example, between 280°C and 300°C. Suitable, the outlet<br><br>
temperature is between 120°C and I80°C, for example, between I30°C and I50°C. Preferably, the spray-dried supported catalyst composition is calcined. Preferably calcination is performed by heating to a temperature of from 200 to 550°C, suitably in air or oxygen, and for a period of from 1 minute to 24 hours. The calcination procedure may also comprise subsequently heating the catalyst under nitrogen. The calcination may be performed in any suitable furnace, for example a rmifflc furnace, or may be performed in situ in a reactor. Any calcination environment used, such as air or oxygen, may be slowly flowing during calcination.<br>
Preferably, the spray-dried, optionally calcined, supported catalyst composition is in the form of spheroidal particles, more preferably microspheroidal particles. By the term "spheroidal particles", as used herein, is meant particles of essentially spherical shape. By the term "microspheroidal particles", as used herein, is meant particles of essentially spherical shape and of less than 300 microns diameter.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for the selective oxidation of ethane to ethylene and/or acetic acid, and/or the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid which oxidation process comprises contacting ethane and/or ethylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas at elevated temperature in the presence of a spray-dried supported catalyst composition as hereinbefore described.<br>
For use in the preparation of ethylene and/or acetic acid by the oxidation of ethane and/or ethylene, the supported catalyst composition has preferably been calcined, more preferably, by heating at a temperature in the range from 250 to 500°C in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas, for example air.<br>
The oxidation process may be carried out as a fixed bed process or as a fluidised bed process. However, the supported catalyst compositions of the present invention are especially suitable for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in a fluidised bed. Hence, the oxidation process is preferably a fluidised bed process.<br>
Where the supported catalyst composition is to be used in a fluidised bed<br>
oxidation process, the particle size is, preferably, such that at least 50% of the particles<br>
?-•* have a size less than 300 microns, most preferably such that at least 90% of the particle s<br>
have a size of less than 300 microns. Preferably, the particles of supported catalyst composition for use in the fluidised bed oxidation process are microspheroidal particle^-<br><br>
For use in a fixed bed oxidation process, larger particles of the supported catalyst composition may be preferred, depending on the size of the fixed bed. Suitable particle sizes for a particular size of fixed bed may be readily calculated by the skilled man.<br>
The desired size of the particles of the supported catalyst composition for use in the oxidation process may be achieved by use of pre-formed support particles of a suitable size in the preparation of the supported catalyst composition. The desired particle size may also be achieved from a wider range of particles sizes by the use of suitable sieves, optionally with grinding of larger particles.<br>
Hence, where the supported catalyst composition is to be used in a fluidised bed oxidation process in the form of microspheroidal particles, this may be achieved by use of suitable pre-formed alpha-alumina granules of less than 300 microns size, preferably, pre-formed microspheroidal alpha-alumina, in the preparation of said supported catalyst composition.<br>
Preferably, the supported catalyst composition for use in the oxidation process of the present invention comprises the metals molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and gold, in the absence of palladium, according to the empirical formula (I) as defined above. Most preferred supported catalyst compositions are as defined by the preferred values of a, b, c, d, e, f and Y as previously described.<br>
The feed to the oxidation process of the present invention comprises ethane and/or ethylene, preferably ethane.<br>
Ethane and/or ethylene may each be used in substantially pure form or admixed with one or more of nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water in the form of steam, which may be present in major amounts, for example greater than 5 volume percent or one or more of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, C^/C^ alkenes and alkenes, which may be present in minor amounts, for example less than 5 volume percent.<br>
The molecular oxygen-containing gas may be air or a gas richer or poorer in molecular oxygen than air, for example oxygen. A suitable gas may be, for example, oxygen diluted with a suitable diluent, for example nitrogen.<br>
It is preferred to feed, in addition to ethane and/or ethylene and the molecular oxygen-containing gas, water (steam) because this can improve the selectivity to acetic acid.<br><br>
Preferred feed compositions (in mol%) comprise, for example, 40 to 80% ethane, 0 to 10% ethylene, 0 to 20% water, 2 to 10% oxygen.<br>
A balance of inert gas, preferably nitrogen, may be used.<br>
The elevated temperature may suitably be in the range from 200 to 500°C, preferably from 200 to 400°C. and most preferably in the range of260°C to 360°C.<br>
The pressure may suitably be atmospheric or superatmospheric, for example in the range from 1 to 50 bar, preferably from 1 to 30 bar.<br>
The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) may suitably be between 100 and 10,000 If', preferably 1000 to 5000 If1.<br>
Operating conditions and other information applicable to the oxidation process of the invention may be found in the aforesaid prior art, for example US Patent No. 4,250,346.<br>
The present invention will now be further illustrated by reference to the following Examples and Figure 1, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a comparison of CO., Space-Time Yields (STY) for two catalysts according to the present invention compared to a spray-dried catalyst on silica.<br>

The catalyst to be used for testing was sieved to obtain a specific particle size distribution (psd) of 70% 230/325 mesh (50/50), 25% pans (fines) and 5% greater than 170 mesh.<br>
The catalyst and an inert diluent (alpha alumina (SA 5396)) were added into a 40 cc fluidised bed reactor.<br>
The reaction was performed at a temperature between 285°C and 330°C and at a reaction pressure of 16 bar. Ethane, ethylene (to mimic a recycle of ethylene), nitrogen and oxygen mixture was fed to the reactor using Brooks Mass Flow Controllers. Water was added by vaporisation and mixing with these feed gases prior to the reaction zone.<br>
The volatile reactor effluent was sampled and analysed by gas liquid chromatography whereas water and acetic acid were condensed and analysed by gas liquid chromatography. The reactor bed temperature was monitored by a moving thermocouple.<br><br>
The reaction conditions used with hours on stream (HOS) are given in Table I.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 Pressure - 16 bar<br>
The results for Catalyst A under the above conditions are given in Table 2 (Sel. = selectivity, STY = Space-Time Yield, Conv. = Conversion):<br>
As used herein, selectivity refers to a percentage that reflects the amount of desired acetic acid product produced as compared to the total carbon in the products formed: -<br>
% Selectivity = 100 * Moles of acetic acid produced / S<br>
wherein S = the molar acid-equivalent sum (carbon basis) of all carbon-containing products, excluding the alkane in the effluent. <br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 Comparison of the results from Catalyst A and Catalyst B, with Comparative Example 1, is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure I shows that the supported catalyst compositions according to the present invention show a reduced CO., formation compared to a catalyst supported on silica alone. Selectivity to desired products (ethylene and acetic acid) is also higher for the supported catalyst composition of the present invention compared to the catalyst composition supported in silica.<br><br><br>
