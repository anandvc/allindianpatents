				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-napthalinide hybrids linked through piperazine moiety as potential antitumour agents. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-napthalimide hybrids linked through piperazine moiety useful as potential antitumour agents.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1-c][l,4]benzodiazepme-napthalimide hybrids linked through piperazine moiety as possible anticancer agents. The structural formula of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-napthalimide hybrids (VIII) is as follows, wherein n1=2,3,4.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines are a family of DNA interactive<br>
antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species. Examples of naturally<br>
occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepines include anthramycin, tomaymycin,<br>
sibiromycin and DC-81. These compounds show their biological activity through<br>
covalent binding via their N10-CII   imine/carbinol	amine moiety to the C2-<br>
amine position of a guanine residue within the minor groove of DNA giving rise<br>
to the preference for Pu-G-Pu sequences. (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.;<br>
Kanbayashi, N., Hamada, M';, Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T and<br>
Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot, 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L. J<br>

Biochem. Biophy. Acta., 1977, 475, 521., Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572.). The molecules have a right-handed twist, when viewed from the C-ring towards the A-ring. This enables the PBD to mirror the curvature of B-form DNA and maintain isohelical contact with the walls and floor of the minor groove.       In the last few years a growing<br><br>

For CT-DNA alone at pH 7.00 ± 0.01, Tm = 69.8°C ± 0.01 (mean value from 10 separate determinations), all Tm values are ± 0.1-0.2° C. For a 1:5 molar ratio of [PBD]/[DNA], where CT-DNA concentration = 100µ,M and ligand concentration = 20µ, M in aqueous sodium phosphate buffer [10 mM sodium phosphate + 1mM EDTA, pH 7.00± 0.01].<br>
interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine hybnds. Many PBD conjugates have been synthesized and investigated for their anticancer activity (Thurston, D E.; Morris, S. J., Hartley, J. A. Chem. Commun. 1996, 563.; Damayanthi, Y., Reddy, B. S P ; Lown, J. W. J Org Chem 1999, 64, 290.; Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy, G S. K.; Ramesh, G Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2002, 12, 1933, Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy Indian patent application No 209/DEL/2000). Recently C-8 linked PBD dimers with C2/C2 exounsaturation have been designed and synthesized (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P W.; Hartley, J A.; Brooks, N. A.; Adam, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E., J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 737). Also, non cross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumor activity (Kamal, A.; Ramesh, G.; Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Snmvas, O.; Neehma, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, V. B.; Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679). During earlier studies in this laboratory PBDs have been linked to naphthahmides through alkane chain which have shown promising anticancer activity (Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy, G. S. K.; Ramesh, G Bioorg Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 1933, Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy Indian patent application No.209/DEL/2000). However, in the present invention the PBD and naphthahmide moieties have been linked through piperazine moiety with alkyl side arms, instead of simple alkane chain spacers. By incorporation of a piperazine moiety in the spacer these new hybnds not only exhibit enhanced in vitro anticancer activity but remarkable DNA binding affinity for a number of this type of hybrids as illustrated in Table 1 and 2.<br>

Biological activity<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines: The human cancer cell lines procured from National Cancer Institute, Fredenck, U.S.A or National Center for Cell Science; Pune, India, were used in present study. Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in complete growth medium (RPMI-1640 medium with 2 raM glutamine, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4, sterilized by filtration and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin before use) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator. The cells at subconfluent stage were harvested from the flask by treatment with trypsin (0.5% in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA) for determination of cytotoxicity. Cells with viability of more than 98% as determined by trypan blue exclusion were used for assay. The cell suspension of the required cell density were prepared in complete growth medium with gentamycin (50µg/ml) for determination of cytotoxicity. A stock solutions of (2 X 10"2 M) of test material were prepared in DMSO . The stock solutions were serially diluted with complete growth medium containing 50µg/ml of gentamycin to obtain working test solutions of required concentrations. In vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines was determined (Monks, A., Scudiero, D., Skehan, P, Shoemaker R., Paull, K., Vistica, D., Hose, C, Langley, J., Cronise, P., Vaigro-Wolff, A., Gray-Goodrich, M., Campbell,H., Mayo, J and Boyd M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,1991,83, 757-766) using 96-well tissue culture plates. The 100 µl of cell suspension was added to each well of the 96-well tissue culture plate. The cells were incubated for 24 hours. Test matenals in complete growth medium<br>
(100µl) were added after 24 hours incubation to the wells containing cell suspension. The plates were further incubated for 48 hours (at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator) after addition of test material and then the cell growth was stopped by gently layering trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 50ul, 50%) on top of the medium in all the wells. The plates were incubated at 4°C for one hour to fix the cells attached to the bottom of the wells. The liquid of all the wells was gently pipetted out and discarded. The plates were washed five times with distilled water to remove TCA, growth medium low molecular weight metabolites, serum proteins etc and air-dned. Cell growth was measured by staining with sulforhodamine B dye (Skehan et al., 1990). The adsorbed dye was dissolved in Tns-Buffer (100 m 1, 0.01M, pH 10.4) and plates were gently stirred for 5 minutes on a mechanical stirrer. The optical density was recorded on ELISA reader at 540 nm. The cell growth was calculated by subtracting mean OD value of respective blank from the mean OD value of experimental set. Percent growth in presence of test material was calculated considering the growth in absence of any test material as 100% and in turn percent growth inhibition in presence of test material will be calculated.
