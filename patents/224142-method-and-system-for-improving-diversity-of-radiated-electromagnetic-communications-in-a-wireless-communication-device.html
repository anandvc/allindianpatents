FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to wireless communication device antennas<br>
and, more particularly, to a system and method for using chassis-embedded antennas<br>
to diversify radiated electromagnetic signals communicated by a wireless<br>
communications device telephone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The size of portable wireless communications devices, such as telephones,<br>
continues to shrink, even as more functionality is added. As a result, the designers<br>
must increase the performance of components or device subsystems while reducing<br>
their size, or placing these components in less desirable locations. One such critical<br>
component is the wireless communications antenna.' This antenna may be connected<br>
to a telephone transceiver, for example, or a global positioning system (GPS)<br>
receiver.<br>
Wireless telephones can operate in a number of different frequency bands. In<br>
the US, the cellular band (AMPS), at around 850 megahertz (MHz), and the PCS<br>
(Personal Communication System) band, at around 1900 MHz, are used. Other<br>
frequency bands include the PCN (Personal Communication Network) at<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2004/091115	PCT/US2I)IM/()I()28I<br>
approximately 1800 MHz, the GSM system (Groqje Speciale Mobile) at<br>
approximately 900 MHz, and the IDC (JapaneseDigital Cellular) at approximately<br>
800 and 1500 MHz. Other bands of interest are OPS signals at approximately 1575<br>
MHz and Bluetooth at approximately 2400 MHs.<br>
Conventionally, good communication resets have been achieved using a whip<br>
antenna. Using a wireless telephone as an example, it is typical to use a combination<br>
of a helical and a whip antenna. In the standby mode with the whip antenna<br>
withdrawn, the wireless device uses the stubby, lower gain helical coil to maintain<br>
control channel communications. When a traffic channel is initiated (the phone<br>
rings), the user has the option of extending the hitter gain whip antenna. Some<br>
devices combine the helical and whip antennas. Other devices disconnect the helical<br>
antenna when the whip antenna is extended. However, the whip antenna increases<br>
the overall form factor of the wireless telephone.<br>
It is known to use a portion of a circuitboard, such as a dc power bus, as an<br>
electromagnetic radiator. This solution eliminates the problem of an antenna<br>
extending from the chassis body. Printed circuitboard, or microstrip antennas can be<br>
formed exclusively for the purpose of electromagnetic communications. These<br>
antennas can provide relatively high performance in a small form factor.<br>
Since not all users understand that an antenna whip must be extended for best<br>
performance, and because the whip creates an undesirable form factor, with a<br>
protrusion to catch in pockets or purses, chassis-embedded antenna styles are being<br>
investigated. That is, the antenna, whether it is a whip, patch, or a related<br>
modification, is formed in the chassis of the phone, or enclosed by the chassis. While<br>
this approach creates a desirable telephone form factor, the antenna becomes more<br>
susceptible to user manipulation and other user-induced loading effects. For<br>
example, an antenna that is tuned to operate in the bandwidth between 824 and S94<br>
megahertz (MHz) while laying on a table, may be optimally tuned to operate between<br>
790 and 830 MHz when it is held in a user's hand. Further, the tuning may depend<br>
upon the physical characteristics of the user and how the user chooses to hold and<br>

operate their phones. Thus, it may be impractical to factory tune a conventional<br>
chassis-embedded antenna to account for the effects of user manipulation.<br>
U.S. Pat. App. 2003/0013469 A1 discloses a system and method for receiving<br>
and transmitting information in a multipath environment. Specifically, a wireless device<br>
with a plurality of antennas will select an antenna based on its reception and or<br>
transmission characteristics. U.S. Pat. App. 2004/0053582 A1 discloses a portable<br>
radio device that provides for switching antennas based on the time slots characteristic<br>
of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems and antenna reception. U.S. Pat.<br>
App. 2002/0101377 A1 discloses a card-based diversity antenna structure where the<br>
antennas are embedded in a wireless communication device,<br>
It would be advantageous if a wireless communications device could sense<br>
degradations in the tuning of a chassis-embedded antenna, due to effect of user<br>
manipulation for example.<br>
It would be advantageous if a wireless communications device used a system of<br>
chassis-embedded antennas to maximize antenna diversity.<br>
It would be advantageous if the wireless communications device chassis-<br>
embedded antenna system could be modified to account for the effects of user<br>
manipulation or other antenna detuning mechanisms.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a wireless communications device chassis-<br>
embedded antenna system and method for improving the diversity of radiated<br>
electromagnetic communications. Because chassis-embedded or internal antennas are<br>
more susceptible to degradation due to user manipulating, the system uses a plurality<br>
of antennas that can be selected in response to monitoring the quality of<br>
communications through each antenna.<br>
Accordingly, a method is provided for diversifying radiated electromagnetic<br>
communications in a wireless commmication device. The method comprises: mounting<br>
a first antenna and a second antenna internal to a wireless communication device<br>
chassis; sensing conducted electromagnetic transmission line signals communicated by<br>
the first and second antennas; and, selecting between the first and second antennas in<br>

response to sensing the transmission line signals. In some aspects of the method, a<br>
single antenna is not selected, but rather, the first and second antennas are combined.<br>
In some aspects of the method, sensing transmission line signals includes<br>
sensing transmission line signal power levels. For example, the transmission line signal<br>
power levels of transmitted signals reflected by the antennas are sensed. In<br>

other aspects, sensing transmission line signals includes sensing the radiated signals<br>
received at the first and second antennas and conducted on the transmission line. For<br>
example, the power levels of the radiated signals conducted on the transmission lines<br>
can be sensed. Then, antenna selection is responsive to the radiated signal<br>
transmission line signal power levels. Alternately, the radiated signals a.re received<br>
and decoded. Then, the antenna supplying the transmission line signal with the<br>
fewest number of decoding errors is selected.<br>
Other aspects of the method comprise: communicating radiated<br>
electromagnetic signals through the first antenna at a first operating frequency; and,<br>
communicating radiated electromagnetic signals through the second antenna at the<br>
first operating frequency. In one aspect, the first and second antennas are separated<br>
by an effective distance of about a quarter-wavelength of the first operating<br>
frequency, to create spatial diversity. In other aspects, the first antenna radiates in a<br>
first polarized radiation pattern and the second antenna radiates in a second polarized<br>
radiation pattern, orthogonal to the first polarized radiation pattern.<br>
Additional details of the above-described method and a wireless telephone<br>
antenna diversity system are provided in more detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram of the present invention wireless<br>
telephone antenna diversity system. The system 100 comprises a chassis 102<br>
(represented as a dotted line), a first transmission line 104, a second transmission line<br>
106, and a first antenna 10S mounted internal to the chassis 102 with a transmission<br>
line port connected to the first transmission line 104. A second antenna 110 is<br>
mounted internal to the chassis 102 with a transmission line port connected to the<br>
second transmission line 106.<br>
• A regulator circuit 112 has an input operatively connected to the first<br>
transmission line 104 on line 113 and an input operatively connected to the second<br>
transmission line 106 on line 114. As used herein, the phrase "operatively<br>
connected" means indirectly connected or connected through an intervening element.<br>
The regulator circuit 112 has an output on line 115 to supply control signals<br>
responsive to conducted electromagnetic transmission line signals on the first and<br>
second transmission lines 104/106.   A switch 116 has a transceiver connection port<br>
on line 118, a port connected to the first transmission line 104, a port connected to the<br>
second transmission line 106, and an input to accept control signals from the regulator<br>
circuit on line 115. The switch 116 selectively connects the transceiver port on line<br>
1 IS to the first and second transmission lines 104/106 in response to the control<br>
signals on line 115.<br>
In one aspect of the system 100, the switch 116 is literally a switch that<br>
permits a transceiver to be connected to one of the antennas. In other aspects of the<br>
system 100, the switch also acts as a combiner. That is, the switch 116 can combine<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 201)4/091115	PCT/IIS2()(I4/(I!O281<br>
(signals to and from) the first and second transmission ports, and connect the<br>
combined ports to the transceiver port in response to control signals on line 115. For<br>
example, the switch 116 can incorporate a convaaiional 3 dB splitter.<br>
Generally, the regulator circuit 112 supples control signals on line 115<br>
responsive to transmission line signal power levels conducted on the first and second<br>
transmission lines 104/106. In one aspect of the system 100, the regulator circuit 112<br>
supplies control signals on line 115 that are respcasive to transmission line signal<br>
power levels reflected from the first antenna port and the second antenna port. That<br>
is, the regulator circuit 112 selects an antenna in lesponse to measuring antenna<br>
mismatch. The antenna mismatch ma}' be responsive to user hand effects and/or the<br>
relationship between the transmission frequency Kid the optimal tuning range of the<br>
antenna.<br>
Alternately, antenna selection decisions can be based upon the strength of the<br>
signals that are received on the antennas 108/110. That is, the first antenna 108<br>
receives radiated signals and supplies conducted transmission line signals on the first<br>
transmission line 104. The second antenna 110 receives radiated signals and supplies<br>
conducted transmission line signals on the second transmission line 106. Then, the<br>
system 100 would further comprise a first power detector 120 having an input<br>
operatively connected to the first transmission line 104 on line 113a and an output<br>
connected to the regulator circuit 112 on 113b to supply transmission line signal<br>
power levels. Likewise, a second power detector 122 would have an input<br>
operatively connected to (lie second transmission line 106 on line 114a and an output<br>
connected to the regulator circuit 112 on 114b to supply transmission line signal<br>
power levels. Alternately but not shown, a single power detector interposed between<br>
the switch and the transceiver could be multiplexed to sample the signals on the two<br>
transmission lines. Either way, the regulator circuit 112 supplies control signals on<br>
line 115 that are responsive to the first and second transmission line detected signal<br>
power levels.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram illustrating a variation of the present<br>
invention system 100 of Fig. 1. As above, the first antenna 10S receives radiated<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2(104/091115	PCT/US2004/II10281<br>
signals and supplies conducted transmission line signals on the first transmission line<br>
104. The second antenna 110 receives radiated signals and supplies conducted<br>
transmission line signals on the second transmission line 106. A receiver 200 has an<br>
input connected to the switch transceiver port on line 118 to receive and decode the<br>
transmission line signals. The receiver 200 has an output on line 202 connected to the<br>
regulator circuit 112 to supply decoded signal error signals corresponding to each<br>
antenna. Then, the regulator circuit 112 supplies control signals on line 115 that are<br>
responsive to the decoded error signals for each antenna.<br>
Note that system of Fig. 2 does not exclude any particular modulation scheme<br>
or coding format. Further, the system 100 can be used with modulation schemes that<br>
use forward error correction (FEC) schemes. In other aspect of the system 100, the<br>
antenna selections are made by a communication partner, a wireless telephone base<br>
station for example. Then, the regulator circuit makes antenna selection decisions in<br>
response to commands that are received by receiver 200.<br>
With respect to either Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, the first antenna 108 includes an active<br>
element with a first electric length and the second antenna 110 includes an active<br>
element with a second electrical length. Note that the first and second electrical<br>
lengths may be the same, to communicate at the same frequency. In other aspects, the<br>
electrical length may be different to communicate at different frequencies, or slighdy<br>
offset, to communicate at different ends of a frequency bandwidth. The active<br>
element is defined by the antenna style. For example, a dipole antenna will have a<br>
radiator and a counterpoise, typically with effective electrical lengths that are each an<br>
effective quarter-wavelength multiple of the operating frequency. The electrical<br>
lengths are dependent upon the proximate dielectric material, as the wavelength of a<br>
conducted signal varies with the conducting medium. A monopole antenna .will have<br>
a groundplane counterpoise and a radiator with an effective electrical length that is an<br>
effective quarter-wavelength multiple of the operating frequency. The present<br>
invention system 100 can be enabled with any convention antenna that meets the<br>
form factor of the chassis 102, and the present invention is not limited to any<br>
particular antenna style.<br>

WO 2(11(4/091115	PCT/US2004/I] 1(1281<br>
Fig. 3 is a drawing showing an exemplary antenna mounting arrangement,<br>
featuring antenna spatial diversity. In some aspects, the first antenna 108 has a first<br>
operating frequency responsive to the first electrical length 300 and the second<br>
antenna 110 has a first operating frequency responsive to the second electrical length<br>
302 being equal to the first electrical length 300. The chassis 102 lias a first position<br>
304 for mounting the first antenna 108 and a second position 306 for mounting die<br>
second antenna 110. The first and second positioss 304/306 being separated by an<br>
effective, distance 308 of about a quarter-wavelength of the first operating frequency.<br>
Fig. 4 is a drawing showing an exemplary antenna mounting arrangement,<br>
featuring antenna polarity diversity. The first antenna 108 has a first operating<br>
frequency responsive to the first electrical length 300 and a first polarized radiation<br>
pattern represented by reference designator 400. The second antenna 110 has a first<br>
operating frequency responsive to the second electrical length 302 being equal to the<br>
first electrical length 302, and a second polarized radiation pattern represented by<br>
reference designator 402. The chassis 102 has a first position 404 for mounting the<br>
first antenna 108 and a second position 406 for mounting the second antenna 110.<br>
The first polarized radiation pattern 400 is orthogonal to the second polarized<br>
radiation pattern 402. Note that the polarization patterns need not orthogonal, but<br>
orthogonality typically results in better diversity. It should also be noted that the<br>
polarization pattern is dependent upon the style of the antenna as well as the<br>
placement of the antenna in the chassis.<br>
Fig. 5 is a drawing illustrating the physical dimensions of the chassis 102 of<br>
Figs. 1 through 4. The chassis has a size of 4 inches (length), by 2 inches (width), by<br>
one inch (thickness), or less (in any of the above-mentioned dimensions). Alternately<br>
stated, the chassis 102 has a volume of 8 cubic inches, or less. Although depicted as<br>
having a brick-like shape, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited<br>
to any particular shape. It should also be noted that even a brick-shaped chassis will<br>
have variations to accommodate features such as internal components, handgrip,<br>
display, keypad, and external accessories. The present invention system can also be<br>
enabled in these modified brick-shaped packages.<br>

WO 2004/091115	PCT/US20II4/010281<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic block diagram illustrating a phase shift variation of the<br>
present invention system. A first phase shifter 600 is shown having an input<br>
connected to the first transmission line port of the switch 116 on line 104a and an<br>
input on line 115a to accept control signals from the regulator circuit 112. The first<br>
phase shifter 600 has a plurality of through-signal phase differentiated outputs<br>
selectively connected to the first antenna transmission line port in response to the-<br>
control signals. As shown, the first phase shifter includes three phase-differentiated<br>
outputs on lines 104b, 104c, and 104d, separated by approximately 90 degrees. The<br>
word "approximately" is used because of fabrication tolerances, which will vary for<br>
different manufacturers, and the fact that the frequencies of interest are typically a<br>
band of frequencies, as opposed to a single frequency. The present invention is not<br>
limited to any particular number of phase shifter outputs or any particular<br>
differentiation in phase.<br>
Likewise, a second phase shifter 602 has an input connected to the second<br>
transmission line port of the switch and an input on line 115b to accept control signals<br>
from the regulator circuit 112. The second phase shifter 602 also has a plurality of<br>
through-signal phase-differentiated outputs selectively connected to the second<br>
antenna 110 transmission line port in response to the control signals. Again, three<br>
phase-differentiated outputs 106b, 106c, and 106d are shown as an example,<br>
separated by approximately 90 degrees.<br>
The present invention system 100 can use the phase shifters 600 and 602 to<br>
improve communications being received on either a single, switched antenna, or<br>
communications being received combined on antennas. For example, the phase can<br>
be selected in response to minimizing decoding errors (Fig. 2) or maximizing<br>
received signal power (Fig. 1). Although not specifically shown, the system 100<br>
could also be enabled with just a single phase shifter interposed between the switch<br>
and the transceiver. Such as variation would be more effective when the antennas are<br>
switched, as opposed to combined.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic block diagram illustrating an antenna electrical length<br>
variation of the present invention system. The system 100 comprises a first antenna<br><br>
WO 2004/(191115	PCT/US2(H»4/0H)281<br>
108 having an input on line 115c to accept control signals, and an active element<br>
electrical length responsive to the control signals. Likewise, the second antenna 110<br>
has an input on line 115d to accept control signak, and an active element electrical<br>
length responsive to the control signals. The regolator circuit 112 has outputs<br>
connected to the first and second antennas on line 115c and 115d, respectively, to<br>
supply control signals in response to transmission line- signals on the first and second<br>
transmission line. As above, the regulator circuit can be responsive to power<br>
reflected by the antenna, received signal strength, of decoded error rates. Also as<br>
above, this variation of the system may further incorporate phase shifting elements.<br>
The electrical length of many different antenna styles can be modified by<br>
using a microelectromechanical switches (MEMSs) to change the physical length of<br>
an active element, such as a radiator, or by using a ferroelectric material to change to<br>
dielectric constant proximate to an active elemenL However, the present invention is<br>
not limited to any particular active element electrical length modification means.<br>
Additional details of the above-described MEMS and ferroelectric antennas can be<br>

ELECTRICAL LENGTH, invented by Allen Tran, U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
10/407,966, filed April 3,2003, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Although not specifically shown, from the figures and the above descriptions<br>
it can be extrapolated that the present invention may comprise a plurality of<br>
transmission lines and a plurality of antennas internally mounted to the chassis, each<br>
with a transmission line port connected to a corresponding one of the plurality of<br>
transmission lines. Then, the regulator circuit has inputs operatively connected to<br>
each of the plurality of transmission lines. The switch, likewise, has ports connected<br>
to each of the plurality of antennas to selectively connect the plurality of antennas to<br>
the transceiver port in response to control signals from the regulator circuit. As<br>
above, the regulator circuit can be responsive to power reflected by the antenna,<br>
received signal strength, of decoded error rates. Also as above, this variation of the<br>
system may further incorporate phase shifting elements and/or antennas with<br>
electrical lengths that can be modified.<br>

Fig. 8 is a flowchart illustrating the present invention method for diversifying<br>
radiated electromagnetic communications in a wireless telephone device. Although<br>
the method is depicted as a sequence of numbered steps for clarity, no order should be<br>
inferred from the numbering unless explicitly stated. It should be understood that<br>
some of these steps may be skipped, performed in parallel, or performed without the<br>
requirement of maintaining a strict order of sequence. The method starts at Step 800.<br>
Step S02 mounts a first antenna and a second antenna internal to a wireless<br>
telephone device chassis. Step S04 senses conducted electromagnetic transmission<br>
line signals communicated by the first and second antennas. Step S06 selects between<br>
the first and second antennas in response to sensing the transmission line signals. In<br>
some aspects, selecting between the first and second antennas in Step 806 includes<br>
combining the first and second antennas.<br>
In some aspects of the method, sensing transmission line signals in Step 804<br>
includes sensing transmission line signal power levels. In some aspects, Step 804<br>
senses the transmission line signal power levels of transmitted signals reflected by the<br>
antennas.<br>
Some aspects of the method comprise a further step. Step 801 receives<br>
radiated signals communicated on the first and second antennas. Then, sensing<br>
transmission line signals in Step 804 includes sensing the radiated signals received at<br>
the first and second antennas and conducted on the transmission line.<br>
In one variation, Step 804 senses the power levels of the radiated signals<br>
conducted on the transmission lines. Then, selecting between the first and second<br>
antennas in response to sensing the transmission line signals in Step 806 includes<br>
selecting the antenna in response to the radiated signal transmission line power levels.<br>
In another variation, sensing the radiated signals conducted on the<br>
transmission line in Step 804 includes receiving and decoding the radiated signals.<br>
Then, selecting between the first and second antennas in response to sensing the<br>
transmission line signals in Step 806 includes selecting the antenna supplying the<br>
transmission line signal with the fewest number of decoded errors.<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 200-1/091115	PCT/US2OIMV010281<br>
In some aspects, Step 801a communicates radiated electromagnetic signals<br>
through the first antenna at a first operating frequency. Step SOlb communicates<br>
radiated electromagnetic signals through the second antenna at the first operating<br>
frequency. Then, mounting the first and second antennas internal to a wireless<br>
telephone chassis in Step S02 includes separating the first and second antennas by an<br>
effective distance of about a quarter-wavelength of the first operating frequency. The<br>
word "about" is used because of fabrication tolerances inherent in building an<br>
electrical device, variations in electrical path due to the shape of the proximate<br>
dielectric, and the fact that communications are typically conducted across a band of<br>
frequencies, where only a portion of the band can be- at a perfect quarter-wavelength<br>
relationship. It should be understood that the phase "effective distance" means the<br>
distance between antennas that takes into account the effect of the intervening<br>
material dielectric constant.  In another aspect, Step SOlb communicates radiated<br>
electromagnetic signals through the second antenna at a second operating frequency,<br>
different than the first operating frequency.<br>
In other aspects, communicating radiated electromagnetic signals through the<br>
first antenna at a first operating frequency in Step 801a includes radiating in a first<br>
polarized radiation pattern. Communicating radiated electromagnetic signals through<br>
the second antenna at the first operating frequency in Step SOlb includes radiating in<br>
a second polarized radiation pattern, orthogonal to the first polarized radiation<br>
pattern.<br>
In some aspects of the metiiod, mounting the first and second antennas<br>
internal to a wireless telephone device chassis in Step 802 includes mounting the first<br>
antenna and the second antenna in a chassis having the dimensions of 4 inches, by 2<br>
inches, by 1 inch, or less.<br>
Some aspects of the method include further steps. Step 808 phase shifts the<br>
transmission line signals communicated by a first antenna in response to sensing the<br>
transmission line signals. Step 810 phase shifts the transmission line signals<br>
communicated by a second antenna in response to sensing die transmission line<br>
signals. Another aspect of the method includes yet a further step that may, or may not<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 20(14/(191115	PCT/llS2(H»4/IM0281<br>
be combined with Steps 80S and 810. Step 812 changes the electrical length of the<br>
first and second antennas in response to sensing the transmission line signals.<br>
In some aspects, mounting a first antenna and a second antenna internal to a<br>
wireless telephone device chassis in Step S02 includes mounting a plurality of<br>
antennas internal to the chassis. Sensing conducted electromagnetic transmission line<br>
signals communicated by the first and second antennas in Step 804 includes sensing<br>
transmission line signals communicated by the plurality of antennas. Then, selecting<br>
between the first and second antennas in Step 806 includes selecting between the<br>
plurality of antennas in response to sensing between the plurality of transmission line<br>
signals.<br>
A system and method has been provided for diversifying radiated<br>
electromagnetic communications through the use of selectively connected chassis-<br>
embedded antennas. Although the invention has been presented in the context of a<br>
wireless telephone, it should be understood that the invention has wider application.<br>
Further, although specific arrangements of antennas, switches, phase shifting, and<br>
regulating circuitry has been presented, it should be understood that alternate<br>
arrangements and combinations of the circuitry could be used to enable the invention.<br>
Other variations and embodiments of the invention will occur to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
