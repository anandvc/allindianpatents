PR^CEGg FOR rRODUCING A UUIilitll FOR A VEllI-GM:<br>
rBACKGRQimD   OF THE IIJ^^TIINTIOM<br>
'FIELD OF THE IiriTOJaJn]^<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing<br>
a bumper for a vehicle and particularly, to an improvement in<br>
a process for producing a bumper for a vehicle, which is made<br>
of a synthetic resin and has a sandwich structure including a<br>
core and an outer layer covering the core, the process including<br>
a first step of injecting an outer layer forming material into<br>
a bumper forming cavity through a gate in a mold, and a second<br>
step of injecting a core forming material, thereby allowing the<br>
core forming material to flow into the outer layer forming<br>
material existing in the gate and cavity, while allowing the<br>
outer layer and core forming materials to flow within the cavity.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In such a conventional bumper, the thickness thereof is<br>
set such that it is relatively thin and substantially uniform<br>
in its entirety, and a mounting portion for mounting to a vehicle<br>
body to extend laterally from a central portion of the vehicle<br>
body forms a rear edge of a front and upper portion of the bumper.<br>
In this case, a gate opens into a mounting portion forming area<br>
of the bumper forming cavity in the mold.<br>
In the a process for producing the bumper, while the outer<br>
layer forming material is flowing within the cavity, the core<br>
forming material is allowed to flow into the outer layer forming<br><br>
material. However, after a front portion of the outer layer<br>
forming material in a flowing direction has reached to a terminal<br>
end of the cavity to stop its flowing, it is difficult to allow<br>
the core forming material to flow into the front portion of the<br>
outer layer forming material in the flowing direction.<br>
In an attempt to produce a bumper using the mold under<br>
such a situation, when the outer layer form.ing material is<br>
injected into the cavity, the capability to distribute the<br>
material into the mounting portion forming area in a lengthwise<br>
direction of the cavity (in a lateral direction of the vehicle<br>
body) is low due to a small volume (i.e., a narrowness) of the<br>
mounting portion forming area. For this reason, as compared<br>
with the time taken for the outer layer forming material to reach<br>
a central end area of the cavity nearer to the mounting portion<br>
forming area to stop its flowing, the time taken for the outer<br>
layer forming material to reach lengthwise opposite end areas<br>
remoter from the mounting portion forming area to stop its<br>
flowing is remarkably long. As a result, in the central end<br>
area, the core forming m.aterial fails to flow into the outer<br>
layer forming material. Due to this, it is impossible to<br>
produce the bumper having a sandwich structure in its entirety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a producing process of the above-described type,<br>
wherein the capability to distribute the material into the<br>
mounting portion forming area of the cavity in the lengthwise<br>
3<br><br>
direction of the cavity can be enhanced, thereby producing a bumper having a<br>
sandwich structure.<br>
FR-A-2494185 discloses a process of producing a bumper for a vehicle, which<br>
is made of a synthetic resin and has a sandwich structure comprised of a core and an<br>
outer layer covering said core, said process comprising a first step of injecting an<br>
outer layer forming material into a bumper forming cavity through a gate in a mold in<br>
which mold the volume of a mounting portion forming area of the bumper forming<br>
cavity is set such that a thickness of at least a mounting portion of the bumper which<br>
is to be mounted to a vehicle body and which extents laterally from a central portion<br>
of the vehicle body is larger than a thickness of a bumper main portion excluding said<br>
mounting portion, and a second step of injecting a core forming material; thereby<br>
allowing said core forming material to flow into said outer layer forming material<br>
existing in said gate and said cavity, while allowing said outer layer and core forming<br>
materials to flow into said cavity.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a<br>
bumper for a vehicle, which is made of a synthetic resin and has a sandwich structure<br>
comprised of a core and an outer layer covering the core, the process comprising: a<br>
first step of injecting an outer layer forming material into a bumper forming cavity<br>
through a gate in a metal mold, in which the volume of a mounting portion forming<br>
area of the bumper forming cavity is set such that a thickness of at least a mounting<br>
portion of the bumper which is to be mounted to a vehicle body and which extends<br>
laterally from a central portion of the vehicle body is larger than a thickness of a<br>
bumper main portion excluding said mounting portion, the gate opening into the<br>
mounting portion forming area; and a second step of injecting a core forming material.<br>
-4-<br><br>
thereby allowing said core forming material to flow into said outer layer forming<br>
material existing in said gate and the cavity, while allowing the outer layer and core<br>
forming materials to flow into said cavity; wherein the injection speed of said core<br>
forming material in said second step is higher than the injection speed of said outer<br>
layer forming material in said first step.<br>
If the volume of the mounting portion forming area of the cavity is set in the<br>
above-described manner, the resistance to the flowing of the outer layer forming<br>
material in the mounting portion forming area is alleviated, leading to an enhanced<br>
capability to distribute the material into such area in a lengthwise direction of the<br>
cavity. This results in a decreased  	<br><br>
difference between the time taken for the outer layer forming<br>
material to reach a central end area of the cavity nearer to<br>
the mounting portion forming area to stop its flowing and the<br>
time taken for the outer layer forming material to reach a<br>
lengthwise opposite end areas remoter from the mounting portion<br>
forming area to stop its flowing. Thus, it is possible to allow<br>
the core forming material to flow substantially uniformly into<br>
the outer layer forming material in the central end area and<br>
the lengthwise opposite end areas to produce a high quality<br>
bumper having a sandwich structure in its entirety.<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of<br>
the invention will become apparent from the following<br>

DETAILED DESCIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of<br>
preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, a bumper 3 made of a synthetic resin<br>
and having a sandwich structure is mounted to a front portion<br>
of a vehicle body 2 of a vehicle 1. The sandwich structure is<br>
comprised of a core 4 and an outer layer 5 covering the core<br>
4, as shown in Fig.2. The bumper 3 has a band-like portion 3a<br>
for mounting to the vehicle body 2, and extending laterally from<br>
a central portion of the vehicle body A. This mounting portion<br>
3a forms a substantially one third of a rear edge of a front<br>
upper portion of the bumper 3 and has a wall thickness ti which<br>
is larger than a wall thickness t2 of a main bumper portion 3b<br>
excluding the mounting portion 3a. For example, a relation,<br>
ti &gt; 1.5 t2 is established between both the wall thicknesses<br>
ti and t2.<br>
The mounting portion 3a is mounted at one end of a steel<br>
beam a by a plurality of clips b, and the other end of the beam<br>
a is mounted to the vehicle body 2. Therefore, it is effective<br>
to increase the wall thickness ti of the mounting portion 3a<br>
for enhancing the mounting strength of the bumper 3.<br>
The core 4 is formed from a main material which is produced<br>
by pulverizing a recovered bumper which is formed using a<br>
7<br><br>
polypropylene (PP) modified by an ethylene propylene rubber<br>
(EPR) and which has a thermo-setting synthetic resin on a surface<br>
thereof. The outer layer 5 is formed from a main material which<br>
is a polypropylene modified by an ethylene-propylene rubber.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, an inj ection molding apparatus 6 used<br>
for producing the bumper 3 includes a first injection unit 10<br>
having a screw 7 to inject an outer layer forming material, a<br>
second injection screw 10 having a screw to inject a core forming<br>
material, a nozzle 11 which connects both the injection units<br>
8 and 10 to each other, a hot runner block 12 connected to the<br>
nozzle 11, and a split metal mold 13 detachably mounted to the<br>
hot runner block 12. The metal mold 13 is comprised of a<br>
stationary die 13i mounted on the hot runner block 12, and a<br>
plurality of movable dies 132 and 133 which are movable toward<br>
and from the stationary die 13i.<br>
A supply passage 14 in the nozzle 14 communicates with<br>
a plurality of gates 16 in the metal mold 13 through a hot runner<br>
15. Each of the gates 16 communicates with a mounting portion<br>
forming area 17a in a bumper forming cavity 17. The mounting<br>
portion forming area 17a has a volume which is set so that the<br>
thickness ti of the mounting portion 3a is larger than the<br>
thickness t2 of the bumper main portion 3b. In Figures, Hi is<br>
a bumper heater, and H2 is a cartridge heater.<br>
A hollow outer needle 18 and a solid inner needle 19 are<br>
disposed concentrically within the nozzle 11. In the outer<br>
needle 18, a valve portion 20 at a tip end is opposed to the<br>
9<br><br>
supply passage 14, and a piston 21 is provided at a base end<br>
and slidably received in a cylinder 22. The piston 21 and the<br>
cylinder 22 constitute a supply passage opening/closing<br>
mechanism 23, In the inner needle 19, a valve portion 24 at<br>
a tip end is opposed to a valve bore 25 defined in the valve<br>
portion 20 of the outer needle 18, and a piston 26 is provided<br>
at a base end and slidably received in a cylinder 27 defined<br>
at the base end of the outer needle 18. The piston 26 and the<br>
cylinder 27 constitute a valve bore opening/closing mechanism<br>
28.<br>
The outer needle 18 has a tapered outer peripheral surface<br>
connected to the valve portion 20, and an outer passage 29 is<br>
defined between the tapered outer peripheral surface and an<br>
inner peripheral surface of the nozzle 11. The outer passage<br>
29 is adapted to communicate at one end thereof with the supply<br>
passage 14 and at the other end thereof with the first injection<br>
unit 8 through a through-hole 30 in the nozzle 11. The outer<br>
needle 18 has a straight outer peripheral surface at its base<br>
end, so that the through-hole 30 can be closed by such outer<br>
peripheral surface.<br>
The inner needle 19 has a tapered outer peripheral surface<br>
connected to the valve portion 24 thereof, and an inner passage<br>
31 is defined between such tapered outer peripheral surface and<br>
the inner peripheral surface of the outer needle 18. The inner<br>
passage 31 is adapted to communicate at one end thereof with<br>
the valve bore 25 and at the other end thereof with the second<br>
^<br><br>
injection unit 10 through through-holes 32 and 33 in the nozzle<br>
11. The inner needle 19 has a straight outer peripheral surface<br>
at its base end, so that the through-hole 32 can be closed by<br>
such outer peripheral surface.<br>
A specified example for producing the bumper 3 using the<br>
injection molding apparatus 6 will be described below.<br>
Referring to Figs.l and 2, the dimensions of portions of<br>
the bumper 3 are as follows: On the basis of the vehicle body<br>
2, the lateral length c = 1700 mm; the longitudinal length d<br>
= 550 mm, the height ^ = 300 mm; the lateral length £ of the<br>
mounting portion 3a = 1200 ram; the longitudinal length g; = 40<br>
mm; the thickness ti = 6 mm; and the thickness ta = 4 mm. A<br>
relation, ti = 1.5 ts is established between both the thicknesses<br>
ti and t2.<br>
The dimensions of portions of the cavity 17 are determined<br>
depending upon the shape of the bumper 3. In this case, the<br>
number of the gates 16 is three; the diameter h of the gate 16<br>
=1.5 mm; the lateral length k of the hot runner 15 = 900 mm;<br>
and the length m between a center line of the supply passage<br>
14 and the left and right ends of the hot runner 15 = 450 mm.<br>
A. Preparation of core forming material<br>
A recovered bumper molded using a polypropylene modified<br>
by an ethylene-propylene rubber and having a two-pack urethane<br>
coating on a surface thereof was selected. The composition of<br>
the recovered bumper is as follows:<br>
|o<br><br>
Polypropylene	64 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber    28 % by weight<br>
Talc	7 % by weight<br>
Coating	1 % by weight<br>
The recovered bumper was thrown into a pulverizer and<br>
pulverized therein. Then, the pulverized material was thrown<br>
into and molten and kneaded in a granulator. The resulting<br>
molten/kneaded material was passed through a filter of 80 to<br>
100 mesh, whereby large particles were removed. Thereafter,<br>
the molten/kneaded material was passed through a capillary<br>
having an inside diameter of 1 mm to form a linear material.<br>
The linear material was cut into a length of 1 to several mm<br>
to provide a pellet-like core forming material.<br>
B.	Preparation of outer layer forming material<br>
A mixture including<br>
Polypropylene	63 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber    30 % by weight<br>
Talc	7 % by weight<br>
to provide the same composition as the recovered bumper (however,<br>
the coating is excluded) was thrown into the granulator and<br>
subjected to the same procedure as in the above-described item<br>
A to produce a pellet-like outer later forming material.<br>
C.	Production of bumper<br>
(i) In Fig. 3, the outer layer forming material was placed into<br>
the first injection unit 8 and maintained in a molten state of<br>
210°C. The core forming material was placed into the second<br>
1/<br><br>
injection unit 10 and maintained in a molten state of 200°C.<br>
The preheating temperatures of the stationary die 13i and the<br>
movable dies 132 and 133 are 40°C and 50°C, respectively.<br>
(ii) At a first step, in a condition in which the outer passage<br>
29 was in a connected state and the inner passage 31 was in a<br>
disconnected state, the outer layer forming material Mi was<br>
injected into the bumper forming cavity 17 through the supply<br>
passage 14, the hot runner 15 and the gates 16 under operation<br>
of the first injection unit 8, as shown in Fig.4.<br>
(iii) At a second step, a portion of the outer passage 29<br>
adjacent the supply passage 14 was throttled by the valve portion<br>
20 under operation of the first injection unit 8, as shown in<br>
Fig.5. In a condition in which the inner passage 31 was in a<br>
connected state, the core forming material Ma was injected under<br>
operation of the second injection unit 10, whereby the core<br>
forming material M2 is allowed to flow into the outer layer<br>
forming material Mi in the supply passage 14, the hot runner<br>
15, the gates 16 and the cavity 17, and the outer layer and core<br>
forming materials Mi and M2 are allowed to flow within the cavity<br>
17. Then, the operation of the second injection unit 10 was<br>
stopped.<br>
(iv) At a third step, in the condition in which the outer<br>
passage 29 was in the connected state and the inner passage 31<br>
was in the disconnected state, the outer layer and core forming<br>
materials Mi and M2 of a double structure existing in the supply<br>
|2^<br><br>
passage 14, the hot runner 15 and the gates 15 were pushed into<br>
the cavity 8 by the outer layer forming material under operation<br>
of the first injection unit 8, as shown in Fig. 6, thereby forming<br>
a core 4 and an outer layer 5. Then, the operation of the first<br>
injection unit 8 was stopped.<br>
(v) The metal mold 13 was moved away from the hot runner block<br>
12 and then, the mold opening was conducted to provide a bumper<br>
3.<br>
After the above-described producing process, the outer<br>
layer forming material Mi is retained in a molten state within<br>
the hot runner 15 and hence, the molding of the bumper 3 can<br>
be carried out continuously.<br>
Table 1 shows the injection time and the injection speed<br>
for the outer layer forming material Mi and the core forming<br>
material Ma relating to the first, second and third steps in<br>
the production of the bumper 3.<br>

Fig.7 is based on Table 1 and shows the relationship<br>
between the injection time and the injection speed. In this<br>
/^<br><br>
case, the injection speed was controlled at two stages for the<br>
outer layer forming material Mi at the first step; at one stage<br>
for the core forming material M2 and at three stages for the<br>
outer layer forming material Mi at the second step; and at one<br>
stage for the outer layer forming material Mi at the third step.<br>
If the volume of the mounting portion forming area 17a<br>
of the cavity 17 is set so that it is increased in accordance<br>
with the thickness ti of the mounting portion 3a, as described<br>
above, the resistance to the flow of the outer layer forming<br>
material in the mounting portion forming area 17a is decreased<br>
and hence, the capability to distribute the material in a<br>
lengthwise direction of the cavity in the area 17a is enhanced,<br>
as shown in Fig.8. As a result, a difference is decreased<br>
between the time taken for the outer layer forming material Mi<br>
to reach a central end area 17b of the cavity 17 nearer the<br>
mounting portion forming area l7a to become stopped in flow as<br>
shown in the cavity in Figs . 1 and 2 and the time taken for the<br>
outer layer forming material Mi to reach lengthwise opposite-end<br>
areas 17c of the cavity 17 remoter from the mounting portion<br>
forming area l7a to become stopped in flow as shown in the bumper<br>
3 in Fig.l. Thus, the core forming material M2 can be allowed<br>
to flow substantially equally into the outer layer forming<br>
material Mi in the central end area 17b and in the lengthwise<br>
opposite-end areas 17c.<br>
The bumper 3 produced in the above manner was excellent<br>
in quality and had a sandwich structure in its entirety. For<br>
IH<br><br>
the bumper 3, the filling rate of the core forming material<br>
prepared from the recovered bumper is high, which is effective<br>
for providing a reduction in production cost of the bumper 3<br>
and a resources saving.<br>
If the injection speed Ve of the core forming material<br>
M2 at the second step is set higher than injection speeds Va<br>
and Vb of the outer layer forming material Mi at the first step,<br>
it is possible to allow the a front portion of the core forming<br>
material as viewed in a flowing direction to flow into a front<br>
portion of the outer layer forming material as viewed in a<br>
flowing direction, thereby forming the bumper 3 into near a more<br>
perfect sandwich structure. In this case, if the injection<br>
speeds Vb, Vc and Vd of the outer layer forming material Mi are<br>
set lower than the highest injection speed Va at the first step,<br>
the different between the injection speeds of both the materials<br>
Ml and M2 can be increased even if the injection speed Ve of<br>
the core forming material M2 is less high.<br>
If the injection speed Vd of the outer layer forming<br>
material Mi at the third step is set at a value equal to or lower<br>
than the final injection speed of the outer layer forming<br>
material Mi at the second step, e.g., at Vd in the production<br>
of this bumper 3, the outer layer forming material Mi cannot<br>
flow into the core forming material M2 at the third step, whereby<br>
the gate communication portion of the bumper 3 can be formed<br>
from only the outer layer forming material Mi.<br>
/3'<br><br>
For comparison, to produce a bumper 3 including amounting<br>
portion 3a having a thickness ti equal to a thickness tz  of a<br>
bumper main portion 3b, an attempt was made to produce a bumper<br>
as a comparative example under the same conditions as those<br>
described above, using a metal mold 13 having a narrower mounting<br>
portion forming area 17a.   As a result,  the following<br>
disadvantage was encountered:  the core forming material M2<br>
failed to flow into the outer layer forming material Mi in the<br>
central end area 17b, and the core forming m.aterial M2 broke<br>
through the outer layer forming material Mi to emerge onto the<br>
surface of the outer layer forming material Mi.<br>

The outer layer forming material Mi which may be used for<br>
the production of the bumper 3 includes the following examples:<br>
[Composition example 1]<br>
Polypropylene<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
Talc<br>
Weather-resistant stabilizer<br>
Ultraviolet light absorber<br>
Carbon black (pigment)<br>
Coatability enhancing modifier<br>

Ethylene-propylene rubber      30 % by weight<br>
Talc	10 % by weight<br>

Ultraviolet light absorber 1 g/toOg<br>
Carbon black (pigment)	3 g/lOOg<br>
Coatability enhancing modifier    39/1009<br>
The core forming material M2 which may be used for the<br>
production of the bumper 3 includes the following examples:<br>
(1)	A forming material consisting of 93 % by weight of a<br>
combination of a polypropylene and 7 % by weight of talc. In<br>
this case, the polypropylene contains 30 % by weight of a<br>
ethylene-propylene based rubber simultaneously synthesized at<br>
a step of polymerization of the polypropylene. The talc was<br>
added to the polypropylene at a final step of the synthesis of<br>
the polypropylene. This forming material is more inexpensive<br>
than a forming material containing a polypropylene and an<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber separately produced and blended.<br>
(2)	A forming material containing the following components:<br>
Polypropylene	60 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber   30 % by weight<br>
Talc	10 % by weight<br>
The entire upper edge of the bumper 3 including the<br>
mounting portion 3a may be thickened to have a thickness ti.<br>

1. A process for producing a bumper for a vehicle, which is made<br>
of a synthetic resin and has a sandwich structure comprised of<br>
a core and an outer layer covering said core, said process<br>
comprising:<br>
a first step of injecting an outer layer forming material<br>
into a bumper forming cavity through a gate in a metal mold,<br>
in which the volume of a mounting portion forming area of the<br>
bumper forming cavity is set such that a thickness of at least<br>
a mounting portion of the bumper which is to be mounted to a<br>
vehicle body and which extends laterally from a central portion<br>
of the vehicle body can be larger than a thickness of a bumper<br>
main portion excluding said mounting portion, said gate opening<br>
into said mounting portion forming area; and<br>
a second step of injecting a core forming material, thereby<br>
allowing said core forming material to flow into said outer layer<br>
forming material existing in said gate and said cavity, while<br>
allowing said outer layer and core forming materials to flow<br>
into said cavity.<br>
2,The process for producing a bumper for a vehicle as claimed in<br>
claim 1, wherein the injection speed of said core forming<br>
material at said second step is higher than the injection speed<br>
of said outer layer forming material at said first step.<br><br>
A process for producing a bumper for a vehicle<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
