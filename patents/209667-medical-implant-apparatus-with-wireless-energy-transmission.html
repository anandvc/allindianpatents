The present invention relates to a medical implant apparatus for a patient.<br>
The development of medical devices to be implanted in human beings or animals is currently very intensive resulting in increasingly sophisticated devices Therefore, the implanted medical devices require increasingly amounts of energy, in order to operate as desired. Typically, implanted power sources, such as batteries, are employed for powering the prior art implant devices -<br>
U-S- Patent No. 4 408 607 discloses an electric power supply for providing electrical energy to a medical device comprising a capacitor as the power source. The capacitor is charged from outside the patient's body by the use of a primary winding external to the patient's body and an implanted secondary winding. Radio frequency energy is transmitted from the primary winding to the secondary winding.<br>
U.S. Patent No- 5 713 939 discloses a medical device comprising a rechargeable battery, which is charged by means of electromagnetic induction between an external coil and an implanted coil.<br>
In modem medicine, implanted medical devices are used to control physical functions. There is a need or desire for controlling, adjusting or changing the performance of the implanted medical devices, in order to alter physical or other functions. In many applications the medical device should also be capable of sending information to an external receiver. In addition, it should be possible to send back commands to the<br><br>
implanted medical device for any kind of action.<br>
For example, an implanted pump used to give medical treatment may be an alternative to. injections, which are unpleasant for many patients. Besides, injections always means a risk of infection. Also, medically trained people have to give the injections. The amoiant of medical substance given to the patient may be correlated to, for example, the result of any kind of bloodtest performed by the implanted medical device. After data information on such a bloodtest has been analyzed, commands can be sent to a pimple regarding the kind of treatment to be given and when treatment is to be given. The data information may be analyzed by means implanted in the hyenas body. There are a great  amber of prior art medical devices that use or would be improved by using electrical energy for controlling any ftmction of them when implanted .<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a medical implant apparatus which permits efficient transmission of external energy in a non-invasive manner to an energy operated medical device implanted in a patient.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a medical implant appararus for a patient, comprising an energy transmission means for wireless transmission of energy of a first from outside the patient's body; an inflatable medical device operable in response to energy of a second form; and an implant able energy transforming means for transforming the energy of the first form wirelessly transmitted by the energy transmission means into energy of the second form, which is used for the operation of the medical device .<br>
As a result, the advantage is achieved that the medical implant apparatus of the invention provides simple and effective energy transmission which ensures an extended and reliable functionality of the apparatus, possibly for the rest of the<br><br>
patient's natural life, and at least many years.<br>
Preferably, the energy transforming means comprises at least one element having a positive region and a negative region and adapted to create an energy field between the positive and negative regions when exposed to the energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission means, so that the energy field produces the energy of the second form.<br>
Alternatively, at least one semiconductor circuitry, transistor circuitry or microchip may be substituted for the element having a positive cuid a negative region. Such a semiconductor circuitry, transistor circuitry or microchip is adapted to create an energy field when exposed to the energy of the first form wirelessly transmitted by the energy transmission means, whereby the energy field provides the energy of the second form.<br>
Advantageously, the medical device is directly operated with the energy of the second form, preferably in a non-magnetic and/or non-mechanical manner, as the energy transmission means transmits the energy of the first form. The medical device may be directly operated with the energy of the second form without externally touching subcutaneously implanted components of the apparatus. The advantage of directly using energy as it is transmitted is that the apparatus can be of a very simple design and the few components involved maJces the apparatus extremely reliable.<br>
The medical device may be non-inflatable, i.e. with no hydraulic or pneumatic fluid involved for the adjustments of the medical device. This eliminates problems with fluid leaking from the medical device.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the element comprises an electrical junction element, and the electrical junction element is capable of inducing an electric<br><br>
field between the positive and negative regions when exposed to the first form energy transmitted by the energy transmission means, whereby the second form energy con5)rises electric energy.<br>
Consequently, the medical device suitably is electrically operated, whereby the positive and negative regions of the electrical junction element supply electric energy for the operation of the medical device. The apparatus suitably comprises implant able electric conductors connected to the positive and negative regions of the electrical junction element, whereby the electrical junction element is capable of supplying an electric current, such as a direct current, a pulsating direct current, a combination of a direct and pulsating direct current, an alternating current or a combination of a direct and alternating current, via the conductors. Furthermore, the electrical junction element may be capable of supplying a frequency, amplitude, or frequency and amplitude modulated analog, digital, or a combination of analog and digital signal, which is used in connection with control of the medical device*<br>
The element, preferably in the form of an electrical semiconductor junction element, suitably forms a flat and thin sheet and has a volume of less than 2000 cm to be suited for subcutaneous implantation, so that the electrical junction element can be located just behind the skin of the patient* The electrical junction element should be designed to generate an output current exceeding 1    when exposed to the energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission means. Of course, all the components of the energy transforming means including the electrical junction element to be in contact with the patient's body should be of a biocompatible material. Alternatively, it would be possible to implant the energy transforming means in the thorax or cephalic region of the<br><br>
patient, or in an orifice of tlie patient's body and under the mucosa or intraluminar outside the mucosa of the orifice.<br>
For In vitro  appliances, a particular type of an electrical semiconductor extinction element has been commonly used, namely a so called p-n (positive/negative) junction element, typically in the form of solar cells, A solar cell transforms solar energy in the form of visible light into electric energy in the form of direct current. For example, a p-n junction element may comprise two layers of semiconductor, one potpie (positive) and the other n-type (negative), sandwiched together to form a "p-n junction". This p-n junction induces an electric field across the element when absorbing quanta of light (photons) *<br>
To be more precise, the quanta of light transfer their energy to some of the semiconductor's electrons, which are then able to move about through the material* For each such negatively charged electron, a corresponding positive charge - c "hole" - is created- In an ordinary semiconductor, these electrons and holes recombine after a short time and their energy is wasted as heat. However, when the electrons and holes are swept across the p-n junction in opposite directions by the action of the electric field, the separation of charge induces a voltage across the p-n junction element. By connecting the p-n junction element to an external circuit, the electrons are able to flow thereby creating a current.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been proved that although both the skin and subcutis absorb energy from an external light beam directed against the skin portion behind which a properly designed p-n junction element is located, the light energy transmitted through the skin can induce a current from the p-n junction element strong enough (minimum 1 ^A) to enable the operation of the electrically operated medical device. Thus, a principle junction element is now for the first time used for<br><br>
use solely as energy soirée in    vivo  applications. The apparatus according to the present invention is adapted for in vivo use with senility, output level, and temperature functionality adapted to in vitro  purposes,<br>
However, the apparatus of the present invention is not limited to the use of visible light for the wireless transmission of energy. Thus, in accordance with a broad aspect of the invention, the energy transmission means transmits energy by at least one wireless signal, preferably containing radiant energy-<br>
The wireless signal may comprises a wave signal, for example an electromagnetic wave signal, such as an infrared light signal, a visible light signal, an ultra violet light signal, a laser signal, a micro wave signal, a radio wave signal, an x-ray radiation signal, and a gamma radiation signal. Where applicable, one or more of the above signals may be combined. Alternatively, the wave signal may comprise a sound wave signal, such as an ultrasonic signal- Generally, the wireless signal may comprise a digital, analog or a digital and analog signal.<br>
The energy of the first form transnutted by the energy transmission means may comprise an electric or magnetic field transmitted in pulses, for example digital pulses. Furthermore, the energy transforming means may transform the energy of the first form, which may comprise polarized energy, into a direct current, pulsating direct current, a combination of a direct and pulsating direct current, an alternating current or a combination of a direct and alternating current. Alternatively, the energy of the first form may comprise kinetic energy.<br>
The energy of the second form may comprise a frequency, amplitude or frequency and aitjlitude modulated analog, digital or combined analog and digital signal.<br><br>
The apparatus may further comprise an   pulse generator for generating electrical pulses from the energy of the second form produced by the energy field created by the element having positive and negative regions.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus comprises an iitplantable operation means for operating the medical device and a control device for controlling the operation means, wherein the element powers the operation means with the energy of the second form. The operation means preferably comprises a motor, for example an electric linear motor or an electric rotary motor which is controlled by the control device to rotate a desired number of revolutions. The electric motor may have electrically conductive parts made of plastics. Alternatively, the motor may comprise a hydraulic or pneumatic fluid motor, wherein the control device controls the fluid flow tiring the fluid motor. Motors currently available on the market are getting smaller and smaller. Furthermore, there is a great variety of control methods and miniaturized control equipment available. For example, a number of revolutions of a rotary motor may be analyzed by a Hall-element just a few mm in size.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the medical device comprises hydraulic means and the operation means comprises a pump for pumping a fluid in the hydraulic means, a motor for driving the pump, a valueless fluid conduit between the pump and the hydraulic means of the medical device, and a reservoir for fluid, wherein the reservoir forms part of the conduit. All of the hydraulic components involved are preferably devoid of any non-return valve. This is of great advantage, because with valves involved there is always a risk of malfunction due to improperly working valves, especially when long time periods passes between valve operations. The reservoir<br><br>
may form a fluid chamber with a variable volume, and the pump may distribute fluid from the chamber to the hydraulic means of the medical device by reduction of the volume of the chamber and withdraws fluid from the hydraulic means to the chamber by expansion of the volume of the chamber.<br>
The control device may reverse the operation means by shifting polarity of the energy of the second form. Where the operation means comprises an electric motor the energy of the second form suitably comprises electric energy.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the medical device is operable to perform a reversible function and there is an implant able reversing means for reversing the function performed by the medical device. Such a reversing function preferably is performed in a stepless manner. In this connection, the control device suitably controls the reversing means, which may include a switch, to reverse the function performed by the medical device. The reversing means may comprise hydraulic means including a valve for shifting the flow direction of a fluid in the hydraulic means. Alternatively, the reversing means may comprise a mechanical reversing means, such as a switch or a gearbox.<br>
Where the reversing means comprises a switch the control device suitably controls the operation of the switch by shifting polarity of energy supplied to the switch. The switch may comprise an electric switch and the source of energy may supply electric energy for the operation of the switch.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the apparatus further comprises an implantable energy storage means for storing the energy of the second form and for supplying energy in connection with the operation of the medical device. The energy storage means preferably comprises an electric source of energy, such as an accumulator, a<br><br>
rechargeable battery or a combination of an accumulator and rechargeable battery.<br>
The apparatus may further comprise an implantable switch for switching the operation of the medical device and an implantable source of energy • This embodiment is particularly suited for applications where the energy transmission efficiency of the apparatus is insufficient, i.e, where the implanted medical device is to perform more advanced operations. Such a source of energy preferably is a battery. Alternatively, the source of energy is an accumulator which also may store the energy of the second form,<br>
In accordance with a first alternative, the switch is operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy storage means to switch from an off mode, in which the source of energy is not in use, to an on mode, in which the source of energy supplies energy for the operation of the medical device. In this case, the implantable source of energy may comprise a battery, preferably having a life-time of at least 10 years, or an accumulator. However, other kinds of sources are also conceivable, such as a nuclear source of energy or a chemical source of energy.<br>
In accordance with a second alternative, the apparatus further comprises a remote control for controlling the supply of energy of the implantable source of energy^ wherein the switch is operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy storage means to switch from an off mode, in which the remote control is prevented from controlling the source of energy and the source of energy is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the source of energy to supply energy for the operation of the medical device.<br>
Tn accordance with a third alternative, the energy storage<br><br>
means is omitted, wherein the switch is operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy transforming means to switch from an off mode, in which the remote control is prevented from controlling the source of energy and the source of energy is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the source of energy to supply energy for the operation of the medical device.<br>
In accordance with a fourth alternative, also the remote control is omitted, wherein the switch is operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy transforming means to switch from an off mode, in which the source of energy is not in use, to an on mode, in which the source of energy supplies energy for the operation of the medical device. Where applicable, in the described embodiments the switch may switch when the energy transmission means is transmitting wireless energy, preferably while the transformed energy of the second form is stabilized by an implantable capacitor, which may temporarily (for a few seconds) store the energy of the second form*<br>
The switch mentioned above may comprise an electronic switch or, where applicable, a mechanical switch.<br>
The advantage of using a switch above all is increased control safety, i.e. interfering signals in the patient's surroundings cannot affect the implanted medical device. Furthermore, the lifetime of the source of energy will be significantly prolonged, since the energy consumption of the apparatus will be reduced to a minimum. During the above mentioned standby mode, the remote control uses energy from the source of energy. By means of the energy transmission means energy may be transmitted to activate the switch to connect the source of energy only when energy is required in connection with the operation of the medical device.<br><br>
All of the above embodiments may be combined with at least one implantable sensor for sensing at least one physical parameter of the patient, wherein the control device may control the medical device in response to signals by the sensor. For example, the sensor may comprise a pressure sensor for directly or indirectly sensing the pressure against the medical device or human tissue. The pressure sensor may be any suitable known or conventional pressure sensor such as shown in U.S. patents 5 540 731, 4 846 181, 4 738 267, 4 571 749, 4 407 296 or 3 939 823; or an NPC-102 Medical Angioplasty Sensor.  The control device may comprise an internal control unit to be implanted in the patient for, preferably directly, controlling the medical device in response to signals from the sensor. In response to signals from the sensor, for example pressure, the patient's position or any other important physical parameter, the internal control unit may send information thereon to outside the patient's body. The control device may also automatically control the medical device in response to signals from the sensor. For example, the control device may control the medical device in response to the sensor sensing that the patient is lying, or sensing an abnormally high pressure against the medical device.<br>
Alternatively, the control device may comprise an external control unit outside the patient*s body for, suitably directly, controlling the medical device in response to signals by the sensor. The external control unit may store information on the physical parameter sensed by the sensor and may be manually operated to control the medical device based on the stored information. In addition, there may be at least one implantable sender for sending information on the physical parameter sensed by the sensor.<br>
An external data communicator may be provided outside the<br><br>
patient' s body and an internal data communicator may be implanted in the patient for communicating with the  external communicator.   The implanted communicator may feed data related to the patient,   or related to the  implanted medical  device,   back to the external  communicator*  Alternatively or in combination, the external  communicator may feed data to the internal communicator.   The implanted communicator may suitably feed data related to at  least one physical  signal  of  the patient.   The arrangement of  external and internal communicators  gives the advantage,   among other things,   that a long term control of activities  related to the implanted medical  device  is  achieved.<br>
The  apparatus may further comprise an  implantable programmable  control unit for controlling the medical  device, preferably over time in accordance with an  activity schedule program.   This will advance the apparatus and make possible an adaptation of  the apparatus to the  individual patients.<br>
All  of  the above embodiments  are preferably remote controlled-   Thus,   the apparatus  advantageously comprises a wireless  remote  control  transmitting at least one wireless control signal  for controlling the medical  device.   With such a remote control  it will be possible to adapt  the  function of  the apparatus  to the patient's need in a daily basis,   which is beneficial with respect to the treatment of  the patient.<br>
The wireless remote control may be capable of obtaining information on the condition of the implanted medical device and of  controlling the medical device  in response  to the information.  Also,   The remote control may be  capable  of sending information related to the medical device  from inside  the patient*s body to the outside thereof.<br>
In a particular embodiment of  the invention,   the wireless remote control  comprises at least  one external signal transmitter or transceiver and at  least one  implantable internal<br><br>
signal  receiver or transceiver.   In another particular embodiment of  the  invention,   the wireless  remote  control  comprises  at  least one external  signal receiver or transceiver and at least  one implantable internal signal  transmitter or transceiver.<br>
The wireless remote  control may transmit a carrier signal for carrying the control  signal,   wherein the  carrier signal  is frequency,   amplitude or frequency and amplitude modulated and is digital,   analog or digital  and analog.   Also  the  control  signal used with the carrier signal may be  frequency,   amplitude  or frequency and amplitude modulated.<br>
The  control signal may comprise  a wave  signal,   for example, a sound wave  signal,   such as  an ultrasoxmd wave  signal,   an electromagnetic wave signal,   such as  an infrared light  signal,   a visible  light  signal,   an ultra violet  light  signal,   a laser signal,   a micro wave signal,   a radio wave  signal,   an x-ray radiation  signal,   or a gamma radiation  signal.   Where applicable, two or more of the above  signals may be  combined.<br>
The control  signal may be digital  or analog,   and may comprise an electric or magnetic field-   Suitably,   the wireless remote control may transmit an electromagnetic  carrier wave signal  for carrying the digital or analog control  signal.   For example,   use of an analog carrier wave  signal  carrying a digital control  signal would give safe communication.   The  control signal may be transmitted in pulses by the wireless  remote control.<br>
The energy transforming means may be placed in the thorax, abdomen or cephalic region,   or implanted subcutaneous.<br>
The energy transforming means  of  the apparatus may be implanted,   for example subcutaneously,   in the abdomen,   thorax or cephalic region,   or other locations  in the patient's body.<br>
In accordance with a narrow aspect  of  the  invention,   the energy transforming means may be structurally different  from the energy transmission means,   and/or may transform the energy of<br><br>
the first  form into the energy of  the  second form in a non-mechanical manner.<br>
The medical  implant  apparatus as  described above may be laparascopically implanted  in a patient by placing at least two laparascopic cannula within the patient's body,   and implanting the energy transforming means  in the patient's body by using the at  least  two  laparascopic   cannula-<br>
Alternatively the apparatus may be  implanted by a) laparascopically placing a medical device of  the  apparatus through the abdomen or thorax of a patient,   b)   placing at least two laparoscopic trocars  within the patient's body,   c)   using at least one  dissecting tool   inserted through the  laparoscopic trocar,   dissecting the region where the medical device is to be placed,   d)   introducing the medical device through the trocars, e)   placing the medical device in engagement with an organ of the patient,   and f)   implanting an energy transforming means of the apparatus.<br>
The method as  recited in a)-e)   may further comprise postoperatively adjusting  the medical device in a non-invasive procedure.<br>
It  is  the primary object of  the present  invention to provide a simple yet effective apparatus  for treating chronic diseases in hetmans or animals.     This  and other objects of  the invention will become clear from an inspection of  the detailed description of the invention and from the appended claims.<br>
The above described medical  implant apparatus of the invention is suited for any of a variety of prior art implantable medical  devices,   such as  infusion primps  for medication,   transponders,   pacemakers,   heart  stimulators,  heart sensors,   rings  or  cuffs  for  sphincter function used for urinary and anal  incontinence,  medical devices  implanted in penis for treating impotence,   rings  or cuffs  for sphincter function used<br><br>
for occluding a blood vessel, for exactly a penis vein of an impotent patient, gastric bands, hiatus hernia treatment devices, equipment for analyzing body functions or blood parameters, and stimulators for generating electric pulses*<br>
The present invention is described in more detail in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
FIGURES 1 to 12 are schematic block diagrams illustrating twelve embodiments, respectively, of the medical implant apparatus of the invention, in which wireless energy is transmitted from outside a patient' s body to energy consuming components of the apparatus implanted in the patient;<br>
FIGURE 13 is a schematic block diagram illustrating conceivable combinations of implanted components for achieving various communication options;<br>
FIGURE 14 illustrates an electrical junction element for use in the apparatus of the present invention; and<br>
FIGURE 15 illustrates an example of  the apparatus in accordance with the invention, in which a medical device is implanted in a patient for treating heartburn and reflux disease *<br>
FIGURE 1 schematically shows a very simple embodiment of the medical implant apparatus of the invention having some parts implanted in a patient and other parts located outside the patient's body. Thus, in FIGURE 1 all parts placed to the right of the patient's skin 2 are implanted and all parts placed to the left of the skin 2 are located outside the patient's body.<br>
The apparatus of FIGURE 1 comprises an   operable medical device 4, which engages a lumen of an organ of the patient to form a restricted passageway in the lumen. Such a lumen may comprise the esophagus, urethra, rectum, colon, a blood vessel or the like. The medical device 4 is capable of<br><br>
performing a reversible function, i,e- to enlarge and reduce the cross-sectional area of the passageway, so that the medical device 4 works as an artificial sphincter. Ana implanted energy transforming means 6 is adapted to supply energy consuming components of the medical device 4 with energy via a power supply line 12- An external energy transmission means 10 includes a wireless remote control transmitting a wireless signal which is received, by a signal receiver incorporated in the implanted energy transforming means 6. The implanted energy transforming means 6 transforms energy from the signal into electric energy which is supplied via the power supply line 12 to the medical device 4, which energy causes portions of the device 4 to move and thus adjust the passageway,<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that a reversing means in the form of an electric switch 14 also is implanted in the patient for reversing the medical device 4* The wireless remote control of the external energy transmission means 10 transmits a wireless signal that carries energy and the implanted energy transforming means 6 transforms the wireless energy into a current for operating the switch 14. When the polarity of the current is shifted by the energy transforming means 6 the switch 14 reverses the function performed by the medical device 4.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that an operation means in the form of a motor 15 for operating the medical device 4 also is implanted in the patient- The motor 15 is powered with energy from the energy transforming means 6, as the remote control of the external energy transmission means 10 transmits a wireless signal to the receiver of the energy transforming means 5.<br>

signals from the sensor 56* A transceiver may be comedies with the sensor 56 for sending information on the sensed physical parameter to the external wireless remote control- The wireless remote control may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver and the implanted control unit 3 6 may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver.

Where the motor/pump unit 18 and battery 50 for powering the motor/pump unit 18 are implanted, the battery 50 may be equipped with a transceiver for sending information on the condition of the battery 50.<br>
Those skilled in the art will realize that the above various embodiments according to FIGURES 1-13 could be combined in many different ways. For example, the energy operated switch 14 could be incorporated in any of the embodiments of FIGURES 3,6-12, the hydraulic shifting device 34 could be incorporated in the embodiment of FIGURE 4, and the gearbox 54 could be incorporated in the embodiment of FIGURE 3.<br>
FIGURE 14 shows an energy transforming means in the form of an electrical junction element 58 for use in any of the above embodiments according to FIGURES 1-13. The element 58 is a flat p-n junction element comprising a p-type semiconductor layer 60 and an n-type semiconductor layer 62 sandwiched together. A light bulb 64 is electrically connected to opposite sides of the element 58 to illustrate how the generated current is obtained. The output of current from such a p-n junction element 58 is correlated to the temperature. See the formula below.<br><br>
I  =  10   (exp(qV/kT)-l)<br>
where<br>
I  is  the external  current  flow,<br>
10  is  the reverse saturation current,<br>
q is  the  fundamental  electronic  charge  of  1.602  x 10-19 coulombs,<br>
V is  the applied voltage,<br>
k is the Boltzmann constant,   and<br>
T is  the absolute  temperature-<br>
Under large negative applied voltage   (reverse bias),   the exponential  term becomes negligible  compared to  1.0,   and I is approximately -10,     10  is  strongly dependent  on the  temperature of the junction and hence  on the  intrinsic-carrier concentration.   10  is larger  for materials with smaller bandgaps than for those with larger bandgaps.   The rectifier action of the diode  --   that is,   its  restriction of  current  flow to only one direction  --  is  in this particular embodiment the key to the operation of the p-n junction element  58.<br>
An alternative way to design a p-n ejection element is to deposit a thin layer of  semiconductor onto  a supporting material which does not absorb the kind of  energy utilized in the respective embodiments.   For use with wirelessly transmitted energy in terms of  light waves,   glass  could be a suitable material-  Various materials may be used in the semiconductor layers  such as but not limited to  camion telluride,   copper-indium-diselenide and silicon-   It  is  also possible to use a multiplayer structure with several  layers of p and n-type materials to improve efficiency.<br>
The electric energy generated by the p-n junction element  58 could be of the same  type as generated by solar cells,   in which the negative and positive fields  create a direct current. Alternatively,   the negative and positive semiconductor layers<br><br>
may change polarity following the transmitted waves, thereby generating an alternating current*<br>
The p-n junction element 58 is designed to make it suited for implantation. Thus, all the external surfaces of the element 58 in contact with the Hx Iman body are made of a biocompatible material-. The p-n junction semiconductors are designed to operate optimally at a body temperature of 37*^0 because the current output, which should be more than lp, is significantly depending on temperature as shown above. Since both the skin and subcutis absorb energy, the relation between the sensitivity or working area of the element 58 and the intensity or strength of the wireless energy transmission is considered- The p-n junction element 58 preferably is designed flat and small. Alternatively, if the element 58 is made in larger sizes it should be flexible, in order to adapt to the patient' s body movements - The volume of the element 58 should be kept less than 2000 cm^.<br>
FIGURE 15 illustrates how any of the above-described embodiments of the medical implant apparatus of the invention may be implanted in a patient for treating heartburn and reflux disease. Thus, a medical device 4 implanted in a patient engages the esophagus 66 close to the cardiac to form an artificial sphincter around the food passageway in the esophagus- An implanted operation means 68, which may also be referred to as an adjustment means, such as an electric motor or a motor/pump assembly/ operates the medical device 4 through a transmission member 70, such as a mechanical transmission cord or a fluid tube. An energy transforming means in the form of an element 6 having a positive region and a negative region, as described above in more detail, is placed underneath the skin of the patient.<br>
Wireless energy carried by a signal transmitted by a wireless remote control of an external energy transmission means<br><br>
10  at least partly penetrates  the patient's skin and hits the element 6.   The energy thus hitting the element  6  is transformed into energy of a different  form that  is  suited for powering the operation means  68.   For example,   where  the operation means  68  is an electric motor  the element  €  comprises an electric p-n junction element  that  transforms the wireless energy into an electric  current  for powering the  electric motor.   Where the operation means  68   comprises  a pump,   the element  6  may transform the wireless energy into kinetic energy for powering the pump.<br>
The  transformed energy may be utilized for directly operating  the medical  device  4  or,   where the medical device 4  is electrically operated,   for  storage in a capacitor and/or an accumulator for later or parallel use.   Preferably   (but not necessarily)   the  element  6  is  controlled by a microprocessor. The wireless  remote  control  of  the external energy transmission means  10  is used to  control   the utilization of  the  transmitted energy and any function or  command to/from the  implanted medical device 4.<br><br><br><br>
