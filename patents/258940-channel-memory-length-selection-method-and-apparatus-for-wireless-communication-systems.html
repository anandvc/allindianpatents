Systems<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to digital communications, arid<br>
more particularly to a channel memory length selection method for<br>
wireless communication systems.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Transmission channels suffer from time-varying frequency<br>
selective fading in many wireless communication environments.<br>
The time-varying frequency selective fading in turn causes<br>
inter-symbol interference (ISI) problem at the receiving side of a<br>
wireless communication system. Before the transmitted data<br>
sequence being estimated in an equalizer, the channel memory<br>
length as well as the impulse response of current transmission<br>
channel should be estimated as accurate as possible.<br>
In practice, wireless communication systems may operate in<br>
channel profiles having very different delay spread. In GSM/EDGE<br>
(Global System for Mobile communication/Enhanced Data rates<br>
for Global Evolution), for example, the largest delay may be 0.5 us<br>
(micro-second) in a rural area (RA) model, but may be up to 20 us<br>
in a hilly terrain (HT) model. Since the GSM symbol duration is<br>
about 3.69us, the largest delays of the two models will last to<br>
about first and sixth taps of symbols respectively. This<br>
phenomenon makes it difficult to settle a constant channel<br>
memory length for all potential channel profiles. Both<br>
over-estimation and under-estimation of the channel memory<br>
length will lead to a degradation of the equalizer.<br>
FIG.l shows a schematic block diagram of a typical equalizer<br>
100 in accordance with prior arts. Equalizer 100 contains a<br>
channel estimation unit 110 and a data estimation unit 120. The<br>
channel estimation unit 110 takes a received signal r(k) and a<br>
training sequence b(k) as inputs and outputs an estimated<br>
channel impulse response (CIR) h(k) to the data estimation unit<br>
120 for subsequent equalization processing. In GSM protocol, for<br>
example, each burst of received signal r(k) in average contains<br>
156.25 bits in the corresponding time slot. The training sequence<br>
b(k) is a known pattern resided in a burst for reconstruction of<br>
transmitted signals. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
the taps of CIR estimation h(k) may be obtained from the<br>
cross-correlation of the received signal r(k) and the training<br>
sequence b(k) as shown in the formula below:<br>
in which N is a properly selected number according to system<br>
design and L is referred to a number of the CIR taps capable of<br>
covering the worst case communication environment. For example,<br>
N may be 26 to use all the training sequence bits to estimate the<br>
CIR. Usually, a number less than 26 may be used under efficiency<br>
consideration. Other methods well known to those skilled in the<br>
art can also be used to estimate the CIR.<br>
FIG.2 shows a known method to select an appropriate<br>
channel memory length best fitting the actual communication<br>
environment. The method includes computing an initial CIR<br>
estimation (step 20); determining a refined CIR of length LM with a<br>
maximum energy EM by sliding widow searching the initial CIR<br>
estimation (step 22); eliminating taps less than the product of a<br>
ratio R and the maximum energy EM in the refined CIR, in which<br>
the energy of a CIR may be evaluated by a sum of all taps of the<br>
CIR (step 24). The number of taps of the resulted refined CIR is<br>
selected as the channel memory length (step 26), and the refined<br>
CIR can be used for operation in subsequent stages to the<br>
equalizer.<br>
The foregoing method does not consider the variation between<br>
different environments. In a typical low delay spread environment,<br>
most energy may concentrate in a limited number of taps,<br>
therefore a larger value of the ratio R may be required to remove<br>
redundant taps which are essentially introduced by fading or<br>
noise. On the contrary, in a high delay spread environment,<br>
energy may spread over more channel taps. In such case, a<br>
smaller ratio R may be required.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of a channel memory length<br>
selection method for wireless communication systems in<br>
accordance with the present invention will be described<br>
below in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
FIG.3 shows a flowchart diagram of a channel memory length<br>
selection method in accordance with a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, and the method includes estimating an<br>
initial channel impulse response (CIR) hO (step 30); executing<br>
sliding window searches over the initial CIR hO twice with window<br>
sizes LI and L2 and finding out two refined CIRs hi and h2<br>
respectively with maximum energy El and E2, in which LI is<br>
larger than L2 (step 32); if the ratio E2/E1 is larger than a<br>
predetermined value Ra, then the channel memory length is set to<br>
L2, otherwise the channel memory length is set to LI (step 34).<br>
The Steps (30 and 32) setting a window size to LI (respectively L2)<br>
and executing a sliding window search are to search the initial<br>
CIR hO for a subset CIR with LI (respectively L2) taps. The window<br>
size LI may be selected as the largest possible CIR length (number<br>
of taps) in practical system, jointly considering the longest path<br>
delay spread and the desired complexity of the corresponding<br>
equalizer. Likewise, L2 may be selected as the CIR length in very<br>
short delay spread channels, jointly considering the<br>
characteristics of transmitter/receiver filter and propagation<br>
environment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the predetermined value Ra is preferably larger than<br>
0.9. A typical example of Ra is 0.95. When the ratio E2/E1 is<br>
larger than such a predetermined value Ra, it means most channel<br>
energy has concentrated within the L2 taps. Therefore it is<br>
reasonable to set the channel memory length to L2. On the other<br>
hand, when the ratio E2/E1 is less than the predetermined value<br>
Ra, the more complicated situation should be taken into<br>
consideration, and thus the channel memory length is set to the<br>
longer number LI.<br>
Determining a refined CIR by checking its energy should not<br>
be considered as a limitation to the present invention. Other<br>
characteristic value of a CIR may be used as a variation of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The channel memory length selection method could be<br>
executed on a burst-by-burst basis in embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In practice, the mobile terminal will not keep changing<br>
rapidly between distinct signal propagation areas, for example,<br>
between hilly places, city, or countryside. Therefore, the channel<br>
profile statistic characteristics should be relatively stable for a<br>
period of time. As a consequence, the channel memory length<br>
should remain unchanged during the period of time. The switching<br>
between different channel memory lengths should not occur too<br>
frequently. The following variation of the present invention will<br>
take this observation into consideration.<br>
FIG.4 shows a flowchart diagram of a channel memory length<br>
selection method in accordance with another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the method includes estimating an initial<br>
channel impulse response (CIR) hO (step 40); executing sliding<br>
window searches over the initial CIR hO twice with window sizes<br>
LI and L2 and finding out two refined CIRs hi and h2 respectively<br>
with maximum energy El and E2, in which LI is larger than L2<br>
(step 42); deriving smoothed energy evaluations El_avg and<br>
E2_avg respectively from the burst based energy El and E2<br>
through a formula Ei_avg = r*Ei_avg_p+(l-r)*Ei, in which "i"<br>
represents I or 2, r is a linear combination weighting coefficient,<br>
and Ei_avg_p is the corresponding smoothed energy evaluation of<br>
the previous burst (step 44); switching the channel memory length<br>
to L2 if a ratio E2_avg/El_avg is larger than a predetermined<br>
value Rb for a predetermined number of bursts (step 46);<br>
switching the channel memory length to LI if a ratio<br>
E2_avg/El_avg is less than the predetermined value Rb for the<br>
predetermined number of bursts (step 48).<br>
In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the predetermined value Rb is preferably larger than<br>
0.9. A typical example of Rb is 0.95.<br>
In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the channel memory length selection method is<br>
implemented in the form of program code, and a counting variable<br>
cnt and a threshold T are introduced to trace the times that<br>
E2_avg/El_avg is larger than the predetermined value Rb and the<br>
predetermined number of bursts. Other software scheme may be<br>
employed to attain the similar purpose. The persent invention,<br>
however, is not limited to how much variables have been used to<br>
fine tune the efficiency of the program code.<br>
As mentioned above, a method in accordance with the present<br>
invention may be implemented in the form of program code, which<br>
can readily be embodied by those skilled in the art on the basis of<br>
above detail disclosure. The program code performing the<br>
disclosed channel memory length selection method may be<br>
implemented in a computing architecture such as a digital signal<br>
processor (DSP), a general purpose micro-processor, or an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).<br>
The invention also includes a channel memory length selection<br>
apparatus for wireless communication systems. FIG.5 shows a<br>
schematic block diagram of a channel memory length selection<br>
apparatus 500 in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The channel memory length selection apparatus 500<br>
includes a processing unit 510 and a memory unit 520. The<br>
processing unit 510 includes a main control module 511, an<br>
estimating module 512, a determining module 513, a deriving<br>
module 514, and a channel selecting module 515.<br>
The processing unit 500 may be a sub-system which is, but<br>
not limit to, DSP-based, ASIC or micro-processor based<br>
architecture. Modules 511 to 515 may be software routines or<br>
subroutines executed in the processing unit 500. The main control<br>
module 511 may be a software routine for handling main routine<br>
control. The methods disclosed in foregoing embodiments may be<br>
implemented by properly designed logic operations or program<br>
instructions which properly invoke the estimating module 512, the<br>
determining module 513, the deriving module 514, and the<br>
channel selecting module 515 in the main control module 511 to<br>
attain the channel memory length selection function. Alternatively,<br>
modules 511 to 515 may be properly configured logic elements in<br>
an ASIC to implement the channel selection method disclosed<br>
herein.<br>
Particularly, the estimating module 512 is for estimating the<br>
initial CIR. The determining module 513 is for determining the<br>
refined CIRs. The Deriving module 514 is for computing the<br>
smoothed energy evaluations. The channel selecting module 515 is<br>
for switching the channel memory length to a refined CIR length<br>
according to methods as described in aforementioned<br>
embodiments.<br>
The memory unit 520 may include but not limit to a DRAM<br>
(dynamic random access memory), an SRAM (static random access<br>
memory), or a general purpose register. Specific constants such as<br>
the predetermined values Ra and Rb as defined in foregoing<br>
examples may be stored in the memory unit 520.<br>
In a preferred embodiment under the EGPRS (Enhanced<br>
General Packet Radio Service) system, L I , L2, r, Rb, and<br>
the predetermined number of bursts are respectively set to 7, 4,<br>
0.5, 0.95 and 20. In this embodiment, because the linear<br>
combination weighting coefficient r is set to 0.5, the smoothed<br>
energy evaluation of the present burst is thus an arithmetic mean<br>
of the energy of the corresponding refined CIR of the present burst<br>
and the smoothed energy evaluation of the previous burst. The<br>
resulted BLER (Block Error Rate) comparison between the<br>
disclosed invention and a fixed CIR method is shown in the table<br>
below:<br>
propagation environment and system<br>
parameter<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
in which SI, CCI, and ACI represents "Sensitivity Interference",<br>
"Co-Channel Interference", and "Adjacent-Channel Interference"<br>
respectively. I/f represents interference. The disclosed method<br>
prevails over the system without channel memory length selection<br>
in all propagation environments.<br>
It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to<br>
limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the<br>
contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, alternate<br>
