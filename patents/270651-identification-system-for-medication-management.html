IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to fluid infusion and more particularly, to<br>
identifying a patient and medication so that correct medication is infused into a patient.<br>
Physicians and other medical personnel apply intravenous ("IV") infusion therapy<br>
to treat various medical complications in patients. IV infusion therapy typically involves<br>
infusing medical fluids, such as drugs or nutrients, from a fluid supply, such as a bag,<br>
bottle, or other container, through the tube of a fluid administration set to a cannula<br>
inserted into a patient's blood vessel. In a typical facility, a physician enters an order for<br>
medication for a particular patient. This order may be handled either as a simple<br>
prescription slip, or it may be entered into an automated system, such as a physician order<br>
entry ("POE") system. The prescription slip or the electronic prescription from the POE<br>
system is routed to the pharmacy, where the order is checked, then filled. Typically,<br>
pharmacies check the physician order against possible allergies of the patient and for<br>
possible medication interactions in the case where two or more medications are prescribed,<br>
and also check for contra-indications. For a medication that is to be delivered by IV, the<br>
prescribed medication is prepared by a pharmacist and added to a bag or bottle or other<br>
suitable container at the pharmacy. A pharmacist also typically identifies the prepared<br>
order, identifies the contents of the bag or bottle, and identifies the patient for whom the<br>
bag or bottle is intended with a paper label that is attached to the bag or bottle and in some<br>
cases by other means, such as, for example, including a bar code or magnetic device, or by<br>
use of a radio frequency (RF) signal interactive device such as an RFID tag. In the case of<br>
non-TV drugs, such as oral medications, the drug may itself be labeled with the order or<br>
drug information (including the patient identifier) or may be inserted into a container that<br>
is labeled. Depending on the facility, the medication may be placed into a transport carrier<br>
for transport to a nurse station. Once at the nurse station, the prescriptions are once again<br>
checked against the medications that have been identified for delivery to ensure that no<br>
errors have occurred. If all is in order, the medication is subsequently administered to the<br>
patient.<br>
Medication errors, that is, errors that occur in the ordering, dispensing, and<br>
administration of medications, regardless of whether those errors caused injury or not, are<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
a significant consideration in the delivery of healthcare in the institutional setting.<br>
Additionally, adverse drug events ("ADE"), defined as injuries involving a drug that<br>
require medical intervention and representing some of the most serious medication errors,<br>
are responsible for a number of patient injuries and death. Healthcare facilities continually<br>
search for ways to reduce the occurrence of medication errors. Various systems and<br>
methods are being developed at present to reduce the frequency of occurrence and severity<br>
of preventable adverse drug events ("PADE") and other drug errors. In the administration<br>
of drugs, focus is typically directed to the following five "rights" or factors; that is, the<br>
right drug is directed to the right patient, in the right amount, through the right route, and<br>
at the right time. Systems and methods seeking to reduce ADE's and PADE's should take<br>
these five rights into consideration.<br>
For safety reasons and in order to achieve optimal results, the medication is often<br>
administered in accurate amounts as prescribed by the doctor and in a controlled fashion<br>
by using an infusion pump. Infusion pumps operate by displacing the fluid in a fluid<br>
administration set to force fluid from the fluid supply through the tube and into the patient.<br>
The infusion pump is programmed by a clinician, such as a nurse, with operating<br>
parameters to achieve the administration of the medication as prescribed by the physician.<br>
Such operating, or pumping, parameters are medication- and patient-specific. That is, the<br>
pumping parameters are selected based on the particular medication prescribed and the<br>
specific patient for whom they are intended. It is the nurse's responsibility to match the<br>
prescribed medication with the correct patient and with the properly programmed pump.<br>
Medical infusion pumps have advanced greatly over the years and permit more<br>
precise infusion control resulting in much better treatment for patients. Doctors are more<br>
assured that the doses and infusion rates that they prescribe for their patients can be<br>
delivered to the patients accurately by infusion pumps to achieve optimum therapeutic<br>
effect. However, there remains a continuing concern that the right medication is matched<br>
to the right pump and to the right patient.<br>
Prior attempts have been made to assure that the right medication is administered to<br>
the right patient through the right pump. In one example, a bar code label identifying the<br>
medication and patient is applied to the bag containing the medication at the pharmacy.<br>
After a clinician manually programs the pump, a bar code scanner connected to the pump<br>
is used to read the bar code label on the bag of medication to verify that it identifies the<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
same medication as that programmed into the pump. In another example, a bar code label<br>
applied to the bag of medication is read with a bar code scanner built into the housing of<br>
the pump to automatically program the pump, thus avoiding manual programming entirely.<br>
However, prior art systems do not link a scanned medication or drug to a drug library entry<br>
and therefore do not give the combined protection of dose limits and right drug, right<br>
patient. However, the Medley medication safety system from ALARIS Products of<br>
Cardinal Health, San Diego, California, U.S.A., provides this level of protection in<br>
networked and non-networked environments.<br>
These advanced infusion pumps have revolutionized the way intravenous ("IV")<br>
medications are delivered by providing dose limit protection, thus ensuring that the right<br>
dose of the medication is delivered to the patient. Still missing from these pumps is the<br>
ability to automatically select the right medication from the pump's drug library, ensure<br>
that the medication being administered is for the patient that is currently connected to the<br>
pump, and that the clinician administering the medication is authorized to do so.<br>
As the name implies, multi-channel infusion pumps have more than one pumping<br>
channel, and a respective infusion line or administration set can be installed into each<br>
channel. This arrangement allows the pump of each channel to be programmed to deliver<br>
the particular medication that flows through the respective infusion line or set installed in<br>
the channel such that each line may deliver a different medication at different rates or in<br>
different volumes. In cases where a single patient may be prescribed multiple<br>
simultaneous infusions for different medications, sometimes four or more, the multi-<br>
channel infusion pump provides a distinct advantage. Each channel of a single pump may<br>
be programmed differently. Such multi-channel infusion pumps may be modular, in which<br>
case the number of channels may be varied, or may be fixed, such as a dual-channel pump.<br>
In most cases, all channels of a multi-channel infusion pump are under the control of a<br>
common controller or processor. Alternatively, multiple single-channel pumps may be<br>
used to simultaneously infuse multiple medications into a patient. One potential problem<br>
that exists when infusing a patient with multiple infusion medications, whether through a<br>
multi-channel pump or through multiple single-channel pumps, is ensuring that each<br>
infusion channel or pump is properly programmed to deliver its respective medication.<br>
That is, the particular pump or channel of a pump is properly programmed to deliver the<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
particular medication of the container to which the fluid line of that channel or pump is<br>
connected.<br>
Moreover, even where the right medication arrives at the right patient for<br>
administration, and the correct medication in each infusion line is known, that medication<br>
may regardless be administered incorrectly in the case where the pump is programmed<br>
with incorrect infusion parameters. For example, even where the medication order<br>
includes the correct infusion parameters, those parameters may be incorrectly entered into<br>
an infusion pump causing the infusion pump to administer the medication in a manner that<br>
may not result in the prescribed treatment. The nurse may also start an infusion at the<br>
wrong time or forget to administer an infusion, resulting in incorrect treatment that may<br>
interfere with other scheduled medications prescribed by the physician. Such incorrect<br>
administration of the medication may occur even where the medication is to be<br>
administered using an automated or semi-automated administration device, such as an<br>
infusion pump, if the automated device is programmed with incorrect medication<br>
administration parameters. Even in an automated system where the medication has a bar<br>
code and that bar code includes infusion parameters, errors can occur. The bar code may<br>
have been improperly printed or may have been smudged so that it cannot be read<br>
accurately and in fact is read inaccurately. In other cases, the bar code may simply be<br>
incorrect. Because of such a risk, some health care facilities do not permit a bar code to be<br>
used for anything other than patient identification and medication identification. Such<br>
facilities prefer clinicians to manually program infusion pumps in that facility.<br>
Even though the multi-channel and single-channel infusion pumps of today have<br>
provided significant advances in the art to avoid medication errors and have reduced the<br>
likelihood of such medication errors substantially, further improvements are possible and<br>
desired. Hence, those skilled in the art have recognized a need for an automatic<br>
identification system and method to associate the patient with the correct medication.<br>
Further, those skilled in the art have recognized a need for a more accurate system and<br>
method for programming operating or pumping parameters into infusion pumps so that<br>
errors are avoided. The present invention fulfills this need and others.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now in more detail to the drawings for purposes of illustration of<br>
embodiments of the invention wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or<br>
like elements among the several views, there is shown in FIGURE 1 a figurative view of a<br>
modular infusion pump system 20 having a syringe pump 22, a controller 24, and an<br>
automatic identification system or module ("ID module") 26. In this case the ID module<br>
includes a bar code reader for reading a bar code 28 on a syringe of medication 30 and a<br>
bar code 32 on a patient's 34 wrist band 36 to identify both.<br>
To preserve clarity of illustration in the drawing, the syringe 30 is shown without a<br>
fluid administration set 38 that would normally be connected to its nozzle and to the<br>
patient 34; however, the connection of the administration set 38 from the syringe pump 22<br>
(in which the syringe would be mounted for infusion of its contents) to the patient is<br>
shown in the drawing. In this case, a "tethered" or hand held bar code reader 40 is used to<br>
read the two bar codes 28 and 32. The wiring 42 of the tethered bar code reader is<br>
connected to the ID module 26 at a connector 44 on its front panel 46, although other<br>
means of connection, including wireless connections, are possible. The hand held bar code<br>
reader is mobile and is shown being brought to a remote location from the ID module to<br>
read the bar code on the syringe and as shown in dashed lines to read the bar code on the<br>
patient's identification wrist band.<br>
In this embodiment, the ID module 26 also includes a fixed bar code reader 48 that<br>
is fixedly mounted to the front panel of the ID module. In order to read bar code<br>
information devices, such as a bar code tag, with this fixed reader, the bar code<br>
information device must be moved to the proximity of this fixed bar code reader. As with<br>
the mobile bar code reader, the fixed bar code reader comprises an optical scanner having a<br>
limited field of view. In this case, the field of view of the fixed bar code scanner is outside<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
the ID module housing. Bar code information devices must be placed within the optical<br>
field of view of the respective scanner in order to be read by the bar code reader.<br>
The front panel 46 of the ID module also includes an RFID antenna 50 for use with<br>
an internal RFID reader or interrogator. The reader is useful to read RFID information<br>
devices, such as RFID tags, that may be used on the syringe 30 or the patient 34 instead of,<br>
or with, the bar codes 28 and 32 respectively. Such RFID information devices may be<br>
read-only, or may be writable and may be self-powered or powered by the RFTD reader, as<br>
is well known to those skilled in the art. Positioning an appropriate RFID tag proximate<br>
and within the range of the antenna on the front panel, for example within 2.5 to 8<br>
centimeters (1 to 3 inches), allows the internal RFID reader to read the tag, and if<br>
configured so, to write to the tag as well. In this case, the REDD reader is also fixedly<br>
mounted to the ID module and information devices must be brought to it to be read. The<br>
RFID reader has a wireless, non-optical field of view directed outward from the housing of<br>
the ID module and RFID information devices must be placed within this field of view to<br>
be read.<br>
Further details concerning a modular infusion system 20 having a central controller<br>
24 may be found in U.S. Patent No. 5,713,856 to Eggers et al., which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety. The ID module 26 is connected with the controller 24.<br>
Information may flow directly between the controller and ID module. Alternatively, as<br>
will be discussed in more detail below, a communications interface board may be inserted<br>
between the controller and the ID module.<br>
The ID module 26 contains the embedded bar code scanner 48 that can read linear,<br>
two-dimensional, and other bar code symbologies as well as the RFID reader and antenna<br>
50 to read medication labels 28 as well as patient 34 and clinician identification devices<br>
49. Although not shown, the clinician who operates the modular pump system 20 may<br>
also have an identification device, such as a badge, containing the identification<br>
information for the clinician that is in bar code or RFID form, or both, or other forms, that<br>
can be read by the embodiment of the ID module shown, or by a different embodiment.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown a block diagram of a modular infusion<br>
pump system 20 having a central controller 24 (sometimes referred to as a "PCU"), two<br>
infusion pumps (an LVP 56 and a syringe/PCA pump 22), two physiological monitors<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
comprising an ETCO2 (end tidal carbon dioxide concentration in expired air) module 58,<br>
and an SPO2 (blood oxygen saturation) module 60, all connected to a single patient 34<br>
with the common controller connected to a remote server 62 through a wired or wireless<br>
link 64. Intravenous administration sets 66 communicate medications between the pumps<br>
and the patient, and the ETCO2 sensor 68 and SPO2 sensor 70 communicate physiological<br>
data to their respective modules. Further information concerning an ETCO2 module is<br>
contained in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0106553 to Vanderveen;<br>
further information concerning the SPO2 module is contained in U.S. Patent No. 5,957,885<br>
to Bollish et al., both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The<br>
ID module 26 is also connected to the set of IV and physiological sensing modules at the<br>
right side at the controller 24. This single ID module is applicable for all pump modules<br>
and physiological monitors controlled by the controller, as will be discussed below in more<br>
detail.<br>
The controller 24 is shown connected to remote server 62 by wired connection or<br>
wireless connection. Various data may be communicated between the controller and<br>
server including, such as, for example, but not limited to, medication orders for the patient<br>
34 communicated from the server to the controller, and status of medication<br>
administrations being administered to the patient communicated from the controller to the<br>
server. Other data may be communicated from the server to the controller such as drug<br>
library sets, drug profiles, and other data. It should also be noted that the infusion system<br>
20 may take other forms, such as two syringe pumps and two LVPs, or four LVPs, or four<br>
syringe pumps, or any other combination, since the infusion system is modular in nature.<br>
The combinations presented in FIG. 2 are illustrative of an embodiment only and is not<br>
meant to be limiting of the invention.<br>
Moving now to FIG. 3, a perspective view of the embodiment of the ID module 26<br>
of FIGS. 1 and 2 showing a front panel fixed bar code reader 48, a connector 44 to accept a<br>
complementary connector of the hand-held, mobile, bar code reader 40 (FIG. 1), and the<br>
antenna 50 of the RFID reader, also fixedly mounted to the ID module. Further<br>
information concerning the means of connection of the ID module 26 to other modules<br>
through the IUI (Inter-Unit Interface) connectors 72 and 74 and channel release latch 102<br>
are contained in U.S. Patent No. 5,941,846 to Duffy et al., which is incorporated herein by<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
reference in its entirety. The two IUI connectors permit its mounting at either its left side<br>
(as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2) or at its right side as desired.<br>
The ID module 26 also includes a control panel 76. Although the control panel<br>
may take other forms, in this case, it includes a "SCAN" switch 75. This switch when<br>
pressed activates a reader so that an information device may be read. For example,<br>
pressing the SCAN switch 75 permits a clinician to place a bar code information device<br>
within the fiqld of view of the fixedly mounted bar code reader 48 so that the information<br>
device may be read. Likewise, pressing the SCAN switch activates the hand-held, mobile<br>
bar code reader 40 and the RFID reader 50. In one embodiment, the SCAN switch is<br>
locked out when the pump 22 (FIG. 1) is infusing. In such a configuration, pressing the<br>
SCAN switch will not result in activation of any reader.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, an example of a hand-held bar code reader 40 or scanner<br>
is shown. This is a common type of bar code reader known to those skilled in the art and<br>
no further details of its structure or operation are provided here. Although not shown in<br>
FIG. 4, a cable 42 as shown in FIG. 1 may be used to connect the bar code reader to the ID<br>
module 26. Alternatively, the bar code reader may communicate wirelessly to the Auto<br>
ID. The hand-held scanner has a trigger 41 that will activate the scanner when pressed so<br>
that a bar code information device may be read. However, the front panel SCAN switch<br>
75 must first be activated in this embodiment before the trigger will be activated.<br>
As used herein, an "information device" is a device that contains information<br>
readable by the particular technology for which it was designed. For example, a bar code<br>
is a barcode information device while a RFID tag is considered to be a RFID information<br>
device. Both contain information readable by their respective technology readers.<br>
Information devices and identification devices both include information.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 5, a system is shown in which the ID module 26 directly<br>
communicates with a Communication Interface Board ("CI board") 78 over two spare,<br>
communication lines. FIG. 5 shows the ID module communicating scanned medication<br>
information 80 and scanned patient identification 82. The medication information may<br>
include the medication name and concentration, and in another embodiment, may also<br>
include the rate of infusion and the dose for the medication. Although not shown, the ID<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
module may also be used to scan a clinician's identification and to communicate that<br>
scanned clinician identification to the CI board.<br>
The CI board 78 sends control signals 84 to the ID module 76. One example of a<br>
control signal would be a disable control signal to the ID module so that no bar code<br>
scanning can occur during the manual programming of an infusion pump. This would<br>
render the SCAN switch 75 ineffective. The controller 24 and CI board likewise<br>
communicate with each other. In the embodiment shown, for example, the controller<br>
sends a channel select signal 86 to identify which pumping channel 22 or 56 (FIG. 2) of<br>
the modular infusion system 20 (FIG. 2) the identified medication 80 is in.<br>
Configuration data 88 is also sent from the controller to the CI board 78. Such data<br>
may comprise information concerning the configuration of data that will be transferred to<br>
the CI board, such as the format of data. Upon receiving an infusion order from a remote<br>
server 62 or other source, the CI board communicates the order 90 to the controller. The<br>
CI board operates as a communications interface processor.<br>
The controller 24 also has access to a drug library 92. Further information on drug<br>
libraries is contained in U.S. Patent No. 5,681,285 to Ford, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The drug library may be resident in the controller, in a local<br>
accessible memory, or may be located elsewhere on the system network but be accessible<br>
by the controller. "Drug Library Profiles" may be established in which medications, or<br>
drugs, and permitted concentrations, and permitted pumping parameters are set, such as,<br>
for example, an ICU (intensive care unit) profile, a pediatric profile, a neo-natal profile and<br>
others. Data sets of medications allowed for use and configurations of pumping<br>
parameters including limitations for that use may be available for each drug library profile.<br>
As such, drug library profiles may, although not necessarily, correspond to different<br>
patient care areas of the hospital. Thus a controller located in a pediatric ward, for<br>
example, will utilize a pediatric drug library profile that includes sets of allowed<br>
medications, pumping parameters, and pumping limitations that are specific to patients<br>
classified as pediatric or located in a pediatric ward. Similarly, a controller located in an<br>
ICU would utilize an ICU drug library profile that includes a different set of allowed<br>
medications, pumping parameters, and pumping limitations that are specific to patients<br>
located in an intensive care environment and other patients requiring intensive care.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
A maintenance PC or server 94 is shown that performs updates, revisions, or other<br>
maintenance tasks for the controller 24. Finally, as alluded to above, the CI board 78 is<br>
connected to a remote server 62 having a management program that can upload data 96,<br>
such as medication orders and other data, to the CI board. It should be noted that although<br>
the CI board is shown as a separate element in FIG. 5, in another embodiment it may be<br>
integrated into the controller 24.<br>
The scanned information 80 and 82 is sent directly from the ID module 26 to the CI<br>
board 78 for processing. The CI board then translates the scanned data and sends<br>
medication delivery data 98 or error messages 100 to the controller 24. The advantage<br>
here is that the burden of processing is placed on the CI Board and the ID module without<br>
burdening the controller 24 with additional computer processing of scanned data. This is<br>
advantageous in that such an arrangement avoids interrupting communications between the<br>
infusion or sensor modules and the controller.<br>
In one embodiment, workflow of the system and method described above is<br>
illustrated in an exemplary process shown in FIG. 6. In the following description, the term<br>
"scan" or "scanning" or "read" or "reading" can refer to either bar code scanning or RFID<br>
scanning, or other data gathering techniques or technologies.<br>
Upon initial power up of the infusion system 20 (FIG. 2), the infusion system<br>
prompts the clinician to associate the controller 24 with a patient 34. The patient may have<br>
a patient number or other scheme for identification. Similarly, drugs may have drug<br>
aliases or numbers for identification purposes. Using the embedded scanner 48, tethered<br>
scanner 40, or the RFID unit 50, the clinician scans the patient ID 82. This patient ID may<br>
have various patient information including a patient identifier, patient EMAR (electronic<br>
medication administration record), allergies, or other information. At step 200, the<br>
scanned patient ID is sent from the ID module 26 to the CI board 78 which then sends a<br>
message at step 202 to the controller telling it that it is now associated with the scanned<br>
patient ID. To administer a medication, the clinician scans his or her identification by the<br>
method described above. After the CI board receives the scanned clinician ID at step 204<br>
and recognizes the clinician as having the appropriate authorization to administer the<br>
medication, the CI board signals the controller at step 206 to make available the<br>
medication programming features of the infusion system at step 208. In other<br>
embodiments, reading a clinician information device may not be required. The clinician,<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
for example, then scans a medication container label 28 to obtain scanned medication<br>
information 80 for the label that contains, for example, a patient ID, a medication name, a<br>
medication concentration, and a medication dose. This information is then passed to the<br>
CI board at step 210 where the CI board:<br>
1)	checks to see if the scanned medication information contains the same<br>
patient ID that is associated with the controller to ensure the "right patient"<br>
at step 212,<br>
2)	automatically selects the drug library 92 entry for the scanned medication<br>
name at step 214 and check that the scanned medication name and<br>
medication concentration agrees with the drug library at step 216, thereby<br>
ensuring that the "right medication" and concentration are administered, and<br>
3)	automatically populates medication dose parameters at step 226 to, for<br>
example, the operating memory of the infusion module, thereby ensuring<br>
that the "right dose" of infusion medication is administered.<br>
Prior to automatically populating medication dose parameters to the infusion<br>
module, alert messages may be displayed to the clinician at step 220 if the patient IDs<br>
associated with the controller and medication label do not match at step 212 or if the<br>
scanned medication name is not in the drug library profile that the controller is associated<br>
with at step 216.<br>
Alert messages may also be displayed on the controller 24 when, for example, the<br>
scanned medication information 80 from a label 28 on a syringe 30 indicates that the<br>
syringe is to be administered to a patient named "John Smith" having a particular ID<br>
number, but the scanned patient ID 82 from a bracelet 32 worn by another patient 34 also<br>
named "John Smith" gives a different ID number or code. As a further example, an alert<br>
message may be displayed when the scanned medication information from a label on a<br>
syringe indicates that the syringe contains a medication having a particular concentration<br>
appropriate for an adult patient, but the controller is located in or is otherwise associated<br>
with a pediatric ward and the scanned medication name and/or scanned medication<br>
concentration does not match any entries in the pediatric profile in the drug library 92<br>
accessed by the controller.<br>
If all the scanned parameters are valid, the CI board 78 sends scanned medication<br>
delivery data 98 to the controller 24 at step 222. At step 224, the clinician selects the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
channel that the scanned medication will be administered on, and the drug library 92 entry<br>
as well as the programming parameters are automatically populated for the appropriate<br>
infusion pump or channel at step 226. The clinician must manually confirm that these<br>
parameters are correct at step 228. In a networked environment, these parameters could be<br>
checked with an order entry system 230, perhaps at the pharmacy, to verify at step 232 that<br>
the right order is being administered to the right patient.<br>
It will be noted that a single bar code scanner or RFID scanner is used for all<br>
functional units controlled by the controller, regardless of the nature of the unit. The data<br>
derived by the scanner goes directly to the controller from the ID module, which then<br>
processes it before it reaches a pump unit or other unit. Whether it is a syringe pump 22,<br>
an LVP 56, or a physiological sensor, a single bar code reader or other scanner is used to<br>
provide identification information of the patient and other information as needed. The<br>
single scanner is therefore functional for multiple different medical units or instruments.<br>
Additionally, the bar code scanner is in a separate housing that is modular and detachable<br>
from the controller, as provided by release latch 102 (FIG. 3) and is not mounted in the<br>
housing of any medical instrument providing therapeutic treatment to a patient or in the<br>
housing of any instrument measuring physiological parameters of a patient. The scanner<br>
or ID module is therefore patient specific, rather than pump or "instrument" specific. For<br>
those healthcare facilities that desire bar code or RFID scanning, the ID module is easily<br>
mounted to the infusion system 20 and for those healthcare facilities that are not interested<br>
in such scanning, the ID module need not be a part of their inventory, yet the infusion<br>
system 20 will still function.<br>
For those healthcare facilities that desire bar code scanning, one embodiment of the<br>
ID module 26 of the present invention may have two bar code scanners. One scanner is<br>
built into the front panel 48, while the other scanner 40 may be connected to the ID<br>
module 26 using connector 44 as desired. This redundancy provides an extra measure of<br>
utility to the ID module. Not only is the redundancy useful if one or the other scanner<br>
needs service, but if a patient's identification tag or device 32 cannot be placed near the<br>
built-in bar code scanner, a tethered or untethered scanner may be used to go to the<br>
patient's side and scan the patient's identification tag or device.<br>
Referring once again to FIG. 6, the CI Board 78 may obtain limits for<br>
administering medication from the drug library 92 at step 214. Thereafter, at step 216, the<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/086735	PCT/US2006/004940<br>
CI board checks that the scanned medication information 80 agrees with the limits<br>
obtained from the drug library. If the two sets of information do not agree, an alert<br>
message is generated and sent by the CI Board at step 218 to be displayed by the controller<br>
24 at step 220. For example, an alert message is displayed if the medication dose<br>
parameter obtained from the scanned label 28 on a syringe.30 intended to be administered<br>
to a pediatric patient exceeds medication administration limits that are predefined in a<br>
pediatric profile in the drug library accessed by the controller. Thus, administration errors<br>
are averted in cases where the scanned label, whether a bar code, RFID tag, or other<br>
machine-readable device, may have been improperly printed or programmed, may have<br>
been smudged or corrupted so as to give inaccurate data, or may simply be incorrect.<br>
Additionally, drug library profiles may contain limits on infusions that are<br>
dependent upon a physiological level of the patient. In the case where a physiological<br>
monitor or monitors are is used, such as those shown in FIG. 2 where ETCO2 58 and SPO2<br>
60 monitors are shown, the patient's particular monitored physiological levels would be<br>
compared against limits in the drug library profile and the infusion may be controlled as a<br>
result. Such physiological level limits in a profile may be drug specific or patient specific.<br>
For example, the drug library profile may have a patient physiological level limit for a<br>
particular drug regardless of the particular patient. In another case, patient-specific<br>
characteristics, such as recent medical history or allergies as examples only, may be<br>
considered when considering the impact that a measured physiological level of that<br>
particular patient should have on infusion of a particular drug. In another embodiment,<br>
both drug-specific and patient-specific considerations may be taken into account when<br>
monitoring patient physiological levels.<br>
While several particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described,<br>
it will also be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention. It is also contemplated that various combinations or<br>
subcombinations of the specific features and aspects of the disclosed embodiments can be<br>
combined with or substituted for one another in order to form varying modes of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the<br>
appended claims.<br>
