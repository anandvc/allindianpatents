				<td>Introduction Method for the preparation of dihydropyrnes<br>
Certain 6,6-disubstituted-3-thio-4-hydroxy-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-ones	<br>
have been prepared in co-pending US application 08/319,820 and references therein. All of these compounds were designed to have potent activity vs the HIV protease enzyme and on that basis to be potent antivirals for the treatment of Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease Syndrome (AIDS).<br>
It is well known in the art that other factors may influence the level of actual antiviral activity in cells causing less cellular antiviral activity than expected based on the HIV protease inhibition. Such factors may include instability of the compound in the cellular media, the inability of the agent to enter the cells, binding of the agent to plasma related proteins or cellular proteins, etc. Likewise, some agents may be cytotoxic to the cells themselves thus diminishing their antiviral activity. These are all problems that all antiviral agents must eventually overcome.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the extraordinary discovery by the inventors that certain polar substituents judiciously placed at the 3 and/or 6 positions of the 6,6-disubstituted-5,6-dihydropyrones can dramatically enhance cellular activity, and thus greatly improve the antiviral properties of such substituted agents. The same substituents which enhance the cellular activity also diminish cytotoxicity further enhancing the desirable properties of these agents as antivirals.<br>
The selectively substituted 5,6-dihydropyrones are expected to be extremely useful in the development of treatments for infections caused by viruses, especially by retroviruses that rely on asparryl protease activities for replication and infectivity. One such retrovirus is HIV. For this reason, the antiviral 5,6-dihydropyrones are also expected to be very useful in the treatment of<br><br><br>
diseases and syndromes associated with viral pathogens. One such syndrome is AIDS.<br>

Examples of suitable amines are N.N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine (see, for example, Berge, S.M., et al.. "Pharmaceutical Salts," Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66: 1-19(1977).<br><br>
The base addition salts of said acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner.<br>
Certain of the compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, including hydrated forms, are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Certain of the compounds of the present invention possess one or more chiral centers and each center may exist in the R(D) or S(L) configuration. The present invention includes all enantiomeric and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention can be administered transdermally. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component, either a compound of Formula 1 or a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula 1.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.<br>
In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br><br>
The powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose. a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or, synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants. thickeners, sotubilizing agents, and the like.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form, (n such form the preparation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsules, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 rag to 100 mg preferably 0.5 mg to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active component as determined by a skilled physician. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.<br>
In therapeutic use as antagonists of a retroviral protease, as agents for the treatment of infections caused by a retrovirus including HIV, or as agents for the treatment of diseases due to AIDS, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg to about 10 mg/kg is preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the various synthetic schemes that follow. Protecting groups may be used when appropriate throughout many of the schemes. Although specifically noted in certain schemes, the appropriate use and choice of protecting groups is well known by one skilled in the art, and is not limited to the specific examples below. It is also understood that such groups not only serve to protect chemically reactive sites, but also to enhance solubility or otherwise change physical properties. A<br><br>
good general reference for protecting group preparation and deprotection is "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Theodora Green. A number of general reactions such as oxidations and reductions etc. are not shown in detail but can be done by methods understood by one skilled in the art General transformations are well reviewed in "Comprehensive Organic Transformation" by Richard Larock, and the series "Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods" published by Wiley-Interscience. In general, the starting materials were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise indicated.<br>
There are three major components of the synthesis of the desired products. The formation of a ketoae precursor, the cyclization of that ketone into the dihydropyrone ring system and the addition of the thiol component to complete the preparation of the compounds of the invention. Schemes 1 through 6 address the various methods for preparation of ketones indicated as O.G, K and M.<br>
See Scheme 1 (The schemes begin on page 122.)<br>
The chalcones (C) can be prepared by reaction of the appropriate methylketones and aldehydes using Ba(OH)2 in EtOH as described in Synthesis, 1983, 502-504, An. Quim, Ser. C, 1981, 77(2), 222-224, and Pol. J. Chem., 1982, 56(10-112), 1435. Alternatively the chalcones(C) can be prepared by reaction of the appropriate methylketones and aldehydes using NaOH in EtOH as described by Kohler and Chadwell, Org. Synth. Coll., Vol. I, 78, 1941. The relative ratio of aldehyde, ketone, base and temperature (RT to reflux) varied according to the substitution pattern of the aldehyde and ketone. There have also been reports of conversion of A and B to chalcones C under acidic conditions using HjS04 and acetic anhydride. This may be accomplished by direct treatment with acid or the acid may be used to dehydrate the aldoi intermediate if it does not dehydrate during the reaction with base.<br>
The resulting chaicones(C) were converted into ketones(D) by reduction. The reduction was generally accomplished by hydrogenation using palladium on barium sulfate at room temperature in tetrahydroftiran. On occasion overreduction<br><br>
to the aJcohol was observed. The isolated alcohol or the crude mixture can be oxidized to the ketone with Jones reagent.<br>
The reduction of the enone to the corresponding ketone can be carried out via a number of alternative methods including but not limited to: metals in ammonia as described in Org. Reactions, 1976. Vol 23, 1-253; ethylene glycol and RuCl2£P(Ph&gt;j]j as described in Synthesis, 1973, 359; and copper hydride reagents as described in J. Araer. Chem. Soc., 1974, 96, 3686.<br>
See Scheme 2<br>
Preparation of the ketone G can be accomplished from an appropriate acid(E) and appropriate aucleophile using the Weinreb methodology described in Tetrahedron Letters, 1987, 1857. The appropriate acid can be converted to the acid chloride by treatment with neat thionyi chloride or by treatment with oxalyl chloride in methylene chloride with a catalytic amount of DMF. Treatment of the acid chloride with N.O-dimethylhydroxylamine with bases such as pyridine or triethylamine in inert solvents such as methylene chloride from 0°C to reflux will give intermediate F. Intermediate F can then be converted to G by treatment with the appropriate nucleophile, such as Grignard reagents, at 0°C to reflux in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether. An alternative method of converting the acid E to ketone G is by treatment with alkyl lithiums at -78°C to reflux as described in J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39,2659 and J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1970, 92, 2590. Another route is treatment of the acid chloride with nucleophiles (organomagnesium, copper, cadmium, manganese or zinc reagents) as reviewed in Org. React, 1954, 8,28; Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 33,31,4439; and Tetrahedron Lett, 1970,4647.<br>
See Scheme 3<br>
An alternative preparation of ketone D can be accomplished by reaction of an allylic alcohoi(I) with an appropriate halide(H) using palladium acetate as described in Tetrahedron, 1979, 35, 329. and Tetrahedron Leners, 1991. 32,2121. There are number of catalysts and conditions which will effect this transformation<br><br><br>
such as: Pd(OAch, NaHCO3j, DMF, tetrabutylammonium chloride at RT to reflux; Pd(OAc)2, triethylamine. acetonitrile at RT to reflux.<br>
See Scheme 4<br>
An alternative preparation of ketone G can be accomplished by reaction of aldehyde A with an appropriate nucleophile such as an organo lithium or Grignard reagents from -78°C to room temperature in inert solvents to afford the alcohol. The desired ketone G can by formed by oxidation of the resulting alcohol with Jones reagent or other oxidizing conditions such as the Swern oxidation which are well known to one skilled in the art<br>
See Scheme 5<br>
Friedyl Crafts acylation of the appropriately substituted aromatic can be accomplished by reaction with an acid chloride and aluminum chloride to give ketone K as described by A. I. Vogel, Practical Organic Chemistry, 1962,729-732. The acid chloride, aluminum trichloride, and aromatic substrate, which may also be used as the solvent, are reacted in solvents such as benzene, nitrobenzene, or hexane at 0°C to reflux to afford ketone K. The acid chloride can be reacted with unsubstituted aromatics as well as with substituted aromatics. If an unprotected alcohol is present, additional equivalents of acid chloride can be used to convert the alcohol to the ester, so that the final product would contain an acyl group on the aromatic ring and an ester.<br>
See Scheme 6<br>
Acid E can be converted to desired ketone(M) utilizing a four step route indicated in Scheme 6. The appropriate acid(E) can be converted into the corresponding 0-ketoester(L) utilizing conditions described in Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 1945 and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1979, 72. The resulting ß-ketoester L can be treated with a base, such as NaH or lithium diisopropylamide(LDA), then with an appropriate alkylating agent, R"X at 0°C to<br><br>
room temperature to give the alkylated (3-ketoester. The 0-ketoester can be decarboxylated with acid in tetrahydroruran at reflux. Alternatively the 0-ketoester can be hydrolyzed with base to the acid, then heated with or without acid to give the desired ketone(M).<br>
Scheme 7 displays a general method useful for preparation of phenols or amines as they pertain to the compounds of the invention. These phenols and amines are used for various substituents at the 3 and 6 position of the dihydropyrone products.<br>
See Scheme 7<br>
Chain extension of phenols and amines(N) to the corresponding ethylene hydroxyiated compounds(O) can be accomplished by heating with ethylene carbonate and tetrabutyl ammonium iodide. Alternative methods are alkylation of compound N with iodoethanol or TosO(CH2)2OH (J. Med. Chem., 1995, 1608) with base such as cesium carbonate in solvents such as dioxane, acetone and methylene chloride. In some instances the use of a catalytic amount of sodium iodide can be used to enhance reactivity. Alternatively, the phenol can be reacted with a bromoacetate and the resulting ester can be reduced with a hydride such as LiAlH4 in inert solvents to give compound 0. The alcohol, on intermediate 0, can be protected with standard protecting groups such as tertbutyldimethylsilyl or methoxyethoxymethyl and carried through additional steps before deprotecting. Alternatively, the alcohol can be converted to the mesylate, or activated to a leaving group, and then displaced with nucleophiles such as morpholine, piperazine, or azide to afford P. This representative scheme can be used to modify phenols at a variety of positions on different aromatic rings.<br>
The Ketones D, G, K, M and those prepared from Scheme 7 are cyclized to the dihydropyrone ring following the routes shown in Schemes 8 and 9. Scheme 9 also describes methods for obtaining optically pure forms of the dihydropyrone ring which is a recognized and important aspect of the current invention. The same methods can be used to produce racemic compounds if the resolution step is removed.<br><br>
See Scheme 8<br>
The dihydropyrone ring system can be prepared as described in Can. J. Chem., 1974, 52, 2157-2164 and Synthetic Communications, 1988, 18(9), 949-963. Reaction of the dianion of acetoacetate(Q) with the appropriate ketone(D, G, K or M) in inert solvents such as tetrahydroruran at 0°C to room temperature gave aldol intermediate R. Water can be added directly to the reaction to effect closure. Alternatively the reaction can be worked up by addition of acetic acid or ammonium chloride and the aldol product isolated and characterized or taken on crude. The aldol product(R) can be closed by treating with dilute sodium hydroxide with or without tetrahydroruran present The tetrahydroruran may be necessary to assist in solubilizing the aldol intermediate(R). Protecting groups on intermediate R can be removed before closure to assist in solubilizing the intermediate in base.<br>
Other routes are available to form the dihydropyrone ring such as those described in: J. C. S. Chem. Comm., 1979, 578; J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1984,106, 4294; and J. Org. Chem., 1975,40,1610.<br>
See Scheme 9<br>
The dihydropyrone ring system can also be prepared optically enriched as shown in Scheme 9. The appropriate ketone(D, G, K or M) can be reacted with the appropriate Reformatsky reagent, the equivalent lanthanide species (Tetrahedron 1981,37, (Supp. I), 175; J. Org. Chem., 1984,49,3904) or the anion of t-butyl acetate in inert solvents such as tetrahydroruran at -78°C to reflux to afford the aldol intermediate. The two antipodes can be separated by a chirai HPLC column such as Chiralcel 00(90% hexane/0.1% TFA/10% isopropyl alcohol) or selective enzymatic hydrolysis with enzymes such as Candida antarctica "B" lipase in phosphate buffer with cosolvents such as isopropyl alcohol at room temperature. The resolved ester can be hydrolyzed to the acid(T*) using base under standard conditions.<br><br>
Intermediate T* can also be prepared in a chiral form by reaction of ketone G with a chiral ester(U) to give an intermediate which is a mixture of diasteromers (J. Org. Chem.. 1982,47, I; Tetrahedron. 1980. 36, 227). The aldol mixture can be separated by recrystalltzation or by chromatography to give each enantiomer. Hydrolysis of the ester using base affords acid T*.<br>
Intermediate T can be prepared in racemic form and then resolved by classical means such as cocrystallization with a chiral amine such as 1-(1-oaphthyOethylamine in solvents such as water and isopropyl alcohol. Analysis of the chiral salt by x-ray may allow the determination of the absolute stereochemistry of intermediate T*.<br>
The intermediate T* can be converted to R* by activation of the acid and treatment with the magnesium salt of a half acid ester which is also described in Scheme 6.<br>
Schemes 10 to 14 describe the synthesis of a number of the tosyl reagents (AA, EE, LL) which are used to introduce the 3-thiol moiety to the dihydropyrones of the invention.<br>
See Scheme 10<br>
Phenol V can be reacted with electrophiles, such as Br: in inert solvents at 0°C to room temperature, to give the para substituted phenol. The phenol can be protected with groups such as methoxyethoxymethyl or tettbutyldimethylsilyl which are known to one skilled in the art. The bromine in derivative W can be converted to an anion at low temperature to room temperature by treatment with an aikyi lithium and reacted with electrophiles such as carbon dioxide. The derivatized phenol can be converted to the corresponding thiol using a variety of methods (Tetrahedron Letters, 1996,4523, Chem. Let, 1985,1307, and Tetrahedron Lea, 1993,393). The Newman-Kwart rearrangement is also useful for the conversion of phenol to thiophenol as described in I. Org. Chem,. 1966, 3980; Synth., 1975,43; and J. Chem. Eng. Data., 1975,20,443. Phenol X can be treated with bases such as sodium hydride and dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in solvents such as DMF or tetrahydroftiran at 0°C to reflux to give Y. Vigorous<br><br>
heating of Y at temperatures in the 200°C to 330°C range affords intermediate Z. The free thiol can be prepared by reduction of derivatives such as Z with diisoburytaluminum hydhde(DIBAL-H) or lithium aluminum hydride in inert solvents such as toluene or tetrahydroruran from -78°C to room temperature or by hydrolysis in base. The desired thiotosylate AA can be prepared by reaction of the thiol with tosyl bromide and base such as thethylamine or pyridine in inert solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or toluene at 0°C to room temperature.<br>
See Scheme 11<br>
Another route into desired thiotosyl reagents is indicated in Scheme 1 i. Aniline BB can be converted to the corresponding phenol using a variety of conditions(J. Org. Chem., 1951,16,586; Org. Synth., 1955, Coll. Vol. 3,130). The phenol can be treated with sodiumthiocyanate, sodium bromide, and bromine in methanol at 0°C to 50°C to incorporate the thiocyanate to give CC (Synth., 1992,656). The phenol can be modified or protected using conditions which are understood by one skilled in the art The thiocyanate can be converted to the thiol(DD) by treatment with dithiothreitol(DTT) in phosphate buffer in ethanol at room temperature to reflux or by treatment with lithium aluminum hydride(LAH) in inert solvents such as tetrahydrofuran at 0°C to room temperature. The desired thiotosylate EE can be prepared by reaction of the thiol with tosyl bromide and base as described in Scheme 10.<br>
See Scheme 12<br>
Thiol DD can be converted to the disulfide(FF) by treatment with iodine and triethylamine in ethyl acetate. The disulfide can act as a protecting group for the sulfur. Various reactions can then be carried out on FF and the disulfide convert back to the thiol by treatment with dithiothreitol(DTT) using similar conditions as described in Scheme 11. Reaction of the free thiophenol with tosyl bromide as previously described affords the desired tosyl reagent(EE).<br><br>
See Scheme 13<br>
Thiocyanate CC can be converted to the thiol and then co (hiotosyiate GG using conditions which have been described in previous schemes. Thiotosyiate GG can be derivitized or a protecting group attached using conditions known to one skilled in the art to give EE.<br>
See Scheme 14<br>
The nitro aromatic HH (J. Org. Chem., 1951, 586) can be reduced to the corresponding aniline by hydrogenadon over Raney Nickel at room temperature. The thiocyanate can be introduced para to the amine in a similar manner as descnbed in Scheme 11. Aniline II can be converted to LL by modification of the amine, conversion to thiol(JJ), and tosyladon as previously described. Alternatively aniline II can be protected, converted to the thiol, and reacted with tosyl bromide to give KK. Aniline KK can be deprotected and then modified to give LL. The reactions in this scheme have been previously described or are known to one skilled in the art<br>
Scheme 15 shows the convergent preparation of the desired compounds of the invention. The dihydropyrones (S) described in Schemes 8 and 9 are reacted with the tosyl reagents (AA, EE, LL) described in Schemes 10 to 14 to produce the target compounds.<br>
See Scheme 15<br>
The desired dihydropyrone(MM) can be prepared by reaction with the appropriate dihydropyrone(S), thiotosylate(AA, EE, LL), and potassium carbonate in dimethylformamide(DMF) at room temperature. Other bases and solvents will also effect this reaction such as triethylamine in ethanol or sodium hydride in tetrahydroruran at 0°C to reflux. Alternatively the intermediate S can be brominated with NBS in tert-butanol and then displaced with the thiols such as DD and JJ.<br><br>
Scheme 16 describes alternative methods for effecting the separation of enantiomers into optically pure forms after formation of the dihydropyrone ring.<br>
See Scheme 16<br>
It has been shown that tetrahydropyrones can be resolved as described in the ICI patent WO 93/06235. The 4-hydroxydihydropyrone can be converted to a ester and the ester hydrolyzed with an enzyme to afiford chiral material. This or other similar enzymatic processes may be applicable to the dihydropyrones as indicated in Scheme 16. The 4-hydroxydihydropyrone may also be resolved by classical means by conversion into a salt with chiral amines such as 1 -(1 -naphthyl)ethylamine. The salt may be recrystallized and then freed to afford the desired chiral material OO*.<br>

The compounds of the present invention were evaluated for their in vitro inhibition of HIV-1 protease and for their antiviral efficacy in HIV infected lymphocytes.<br>
HIV Protease Assay:<br>
Materials<br>
Recombinant HIV-l protease (&gt;96% purity) and HIV protease substrate m (the undecapeptide H-His-Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Leu-Nph-Glu-Ala-Nle-Ser-NH2 &gt;97% purity) were purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA).<br><br>
Method<br>
The methods employed follow the procedures of Tummino, et al. (Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 1995. 316. 523). For determination of IC50 values, HIV-1 protease, 6.0 nM final concentration, was added to a solution containing inhibitor, 40µM substrate III and 1.0% Me2SO in assay buffer: 80 mM MES, 160 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000) pH 6.2 at 37°C (total volume, 100 µl). Polyethylene glycol was used in the assay in place of glycerol since the former was reported to be a more effective stabilizing agent of the protease (Jordan, et al. J. Bioi Chem. 1992, 267, 20028). The final inhibitor concentrations used were 0 (0.1,0.2, in some experiments), 0.5,1,2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 µM. The solution was mixed, incubated for 5 minutes and the reaction quenched by addition of trifluoracetic acid, 2% final. The (leu-p-nitro-phe) bond of the substrate is cleaved by the enzyme and substrate and products separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Absorbance was measured at 220 run, peak areas determined, and percentage conversion to product used to calculate percentage control (= [% conversion (+ inhibitor)/% conversion (- inhibitor)] x 100).<br>
Cellular Infection Assay<br>
Compounds were tested in lymphocyte derived CEM cells using the XTT cytopathic procedures and were performed at Southern Research Institute (Buckheit, et al. Antiviral Res. 1993,21,247; see also Weislow, et al. J. Nat. Cancer bat., 1989,81, 577). Compound concentrations were 0.32,1, 3.2, 10,32 and 100 µM. The EC 50 represents the concentration of agent which reduces HIV cytopathic effects 50% relative to untreated control. EC95 represents the concentration of agent protecting the cells 95% relative to untreated control. Cellular toxicity of the agents are estimated from the TCso which represents the concentration of the agent which inhibits 50% of the viability of uninfected cells.<br>

Table 2 shows that compounds of the invention display significantly greater antiviral activity than the reference examples. The reference examples, while being good HIV-protease inhibitors (IC50's 35-150 nM) do not contain the polar group substitutions which are present in all the compounds of the invention. The polar groups do increase HIV protease inhibition, but moreover the polar groups enhance antiviral activity with EC50's and EC95's all more potent than the reference agents. In addition, the cytotoxicity has been decreased (larger TC50's) relative to the reference agents. This data fully supports the invention that the appropriate placement of polar groups on the dihydropyrone protease inhibitors improves antiviral activity in the cellular infection assay.<br><br>
