				<td>This invention relates to the field of plant transformation, particularly to an improved method for Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton.<br>
Cotton is an important crop, grown primarily for its lint, which provides much of the high quality fiber for the textile industry. Cotton seed is also a valuable commodity, as it provides a source for oil, meal and seed hulls.<br>
About 90 % of cotton grown worldwide is Gossypium hirsutum L., whereas Gossypium broadens accounts for the about 8 %.<br>
Improvement of various traits such as resistance to pests, stress or disease, fiber quality, reduced gossypol content, has been obtained by conventional breeding techniques, and further improvement of these and other traits can be achieved using molecular and genetic techniques.<br>
Several methods are available for the transformation of cotton including Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton explants, such as isolated cotyledons, isolated hypocotyls and isolated hypocotyl transition zones, as well as direct gene transfer by microprojectile bombardment of meristimatic cotton tissues.<br>
Firoozabady et at. (1987, Plant f^olecular Biology 10:105-116) described transformation of cotton cotyledon tissues by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and regeneration of transgenic plants.<br>
Umbeck et al. (1987, Bio/Technology 5: 263-266) reported results on cotton transformation via Agrobacterium using hypocotyls as explants.<br>
POT publication ("WO") 89/05344, US patent ("US") 5, 244,802 and US 5,583,036 provide methods for regeneration of cotton by tissue and suspension culture starting with explants which are the hypocotyl, cotyledon<br><br>
or immature embryos. Also taught are method to transform cotton and improve cotton by selective growth.<br>
WO 89/12102 and US 5,164,310 relate to a novel method for transforming and rapidly regenerating plant tissue. The method employs target tissues which are the shoot apices, thereby expanding the species range for transformation and reducing the risk of somaclonal variation.<br>
WO 98/15622 provides a method for the in vitro regeneration of fertile Gossypium plants in which cells from the transition region tissue of seedlings is excised and cultured. A method for the production of transgenic Gossypium plants capable of transmitting a foreign gene to progeny is also described in which cells derived from the transition region tissue of seedlings are targeted for transformation.<br>
WO 97/12512 provides a method for regenerating cotton plants from explant tissue which allows the generation of embryogenic callus from a cotton tissue explant, such as a hypocotyl, which is not cultivated on callus initiation media having exogenous plant hormones. The method can be utilized in the Agrobacterium-n\e6"\ate6 transformation of cotton plants.<br>
US 5,004,863 and US 5,159,135 and European patent publication "EP" 0 270 355 all disclose a method to achieve genetic transformation of cotton plants and lines, by subjecting immature cotton tissues such as hypocotyl segments in vitro to Agrobactehum mediated genetic transformation.<br>
WO 97/43430 relates to a versatile method of rapidly regenerating cotton plants from explants of apical and/or nodal meristematic tissues which can be coupled with well known methods of transformation such as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for the rapid production of genetically-engineered cotton varieties of agronomic importance.<br>
WO 92/15675 and EP 0 531 506 describe a method for the particle-mediated transformation of cotton permitting the direct genetic engineering of elite cotton lines without the need for tissue culture or callus proliferation, involving<br><br>
excision of tfie embryonic axes from germinating seeds and blasting particles carrying foreign genes into the embryonic axes.<br>
Finer and Mc Mullen (1990, Plant Cell Reports, 8: 586-589) described transformation of cotton via particle bombardment of embryogenic suspension cultures.<br>
McCabe and Martinell, (1993, Bio/Technology 11; 596-598) have described transformation of elite cotton cultivars via particle bombardment of cotton meristematic tissue from excised embryonic axes.<br>
Hansen et al. (1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91: 7603-7607) have described an Agrobacterium strain comprising a constitutive viiG mutant (w&gt;GN54D) leading to enhanced transformation efficiencies of isolated cotton cotyledons.<br>
Veluthambi et al. (1989, Journal of Bacteriology 171: 3696-3703) described a markedly increased transformation of cotton shoot tips by the simultaneous addition of acetosyringone and nopaline at the time of infection.<br>
The cotton Agrobacterium-medlaXed transformation methods of the prior art suffer from the major drawback, as indicated in Murray et al. (1993, in Transgenic Plants Vol 2, Academic Press Inc. pi 53-168) that the time required to regenerate a transgenic plant from an explant which has been cocultivated with Agrobacterium cells is extremely long.<br>
Moreover, an additional problem arises from the fact that all described Agrobacterium mediated transformation methods of cotton require the generation of embryogenic callus from the explant containing the transformed cells, as an intermediate step in the regeneration of transgenic cotton plants. Since not all transformed cells of the explant necessarily are competent for the initiation of embryogenic callus, a loss of regeneration of a number of potentially transgenic cells, which consequently results in a low transformation efficiency, is observed with these methods. An increase in starting numbers of putative transformed cotton explants to compensate for this loss, results in an<br><br>
huge increase of the amount of labor to be invested in obtaining regenerated transgenic cotton plants.<br>
WO 89/05344 has suggested in general terms that embryogenic callus may be used as appropriate starting material for Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton callus. Nevertheless, during the past decade no reports were made of successful production of transgenic cotton plants using cocultivation of embryogenic callus with Agrobacterium.<br>
To some extent, the problem has been alleviated by techniques in microprojectile bombardment of meristematic tissue which results in a larger number of transgenic cotton lines. Nonetheless, the generation of germline transformed cotton plants, which are capable of passing on the transgene to their progeny, is infrequent.<br>
The art Is thus deficient in providing an efficient method, both in term of required time and transformation efficiency, for the generation of transgenic cotton plants which are capable of transferring the foreign incorporated DNA to their progeny plants.<br>
Summary and objects of the Invention<br>
In view of the foregoing shortcomings associated with prior art cotton transformation processes as well as other disadvantages not specifically mentioned above, it should be apparent that there still exists a need in the art for a method of transforming cotton which achieves the heretofore elusive combination of a high transformation efficiency in a relatively short period of time. It is therefore a primary objective of the present invention to fulfill that need by providing a method for producing a transgenic cotton plant, preferably a fertile transgenic plant, by /\gfro5acfer/L/m-mediated transformation, comprising cocultivattng Agrobacterium cells comprising a DNA fragment of interest operabiy linked to at least one T-DNA border with cotton embryogenic callus in the presence of a plant phenolic compound.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a transgenic cotton plant which eliminates the step of generating embryogenic callus from a cotton explant comprising the transformed cells, thereby both reducing the potential loss of transformed cotton lines from transformed plant cells which are not capable of generating embryogenic callus, and in this way enhancing transformation frequencies.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a method for producing a transgenic cotton plant comprising incubation of Agrobacterium cells comprising a DNA fragment of interest operably linked to at least one T-DNA border, with a plant phenolic compound prior to or during the co-cultivation of cotton embryogenic callus with the Agrobacterium cells.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for producing a<br>
transgenic cotton plant, comprising:<br>
i) cocultivating cotton embryogenic callus, preferably derived from a hypocotyl<br>
of a cotton seedling,    with Agrobacterium cells, the Agrobacterium cells<br>
comprising a DNA fragment of interest operably linked to at least one T-DNA<br>
border, in" the presence of a plant phenolic compound, preferably selected<br>
from  the  group  consisting  of  acetosyringone,   a-hydroxy-acetosyringone,<br>
sinapinic acid, syringic acid, ferulic acid, catechol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-<br>
resorcylic acid, protocatechuic acid, pyrrogallic acid, gallic acid and vanillin,<br>
preferably present in a concentration range from about 50 pM   to about 400<br>
pM,    for a time sufficient to generate embryogenic callus comprising a<br>
transformed cotton cell, preferably for about 3 to 4 days;<br>
ii) regenerating a transgenic cotton plant from said transformed cell; and<br>
optionally<br>
iii) crossing said transgenic cotton plant with another cotton plant<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a plant phenolic compound, preferably acetosyringone, for Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton embryogenic callus.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The inventors have developed an improved and accelerated Agrobacterium mediated transformation method for the production of transgenic cotton plants, comprising the use of a plant phenolic compound, such as acetosyringone, during Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton embryogenic callus, preferably during the cocultivation stage of cotton embryogenic callus with Agrobacterium cells. This method on average leads to a time reduction in the period starting from cocultivation towards the time point at which the transgenic cotton plant is sufficiently developed to be transferred to soil, preferably under greenhouse conditions, of at least about 2 to 3 months.<br>
Since the improved method of this invention comprises the use of embryogenic callus as starting tissue for the transformation, the step of generating embryogenic callus from the cotton explant comprising the transformed cells is eliminated. Consequently, the potential loss of transformed cotton lines from transformed plant cells which are not capable to generate embryogenic callus is reduced, and transformation frequencies are enhanced.<br>
Moreover, embryogenic callus, once initiated, can be maintained straightforwardly (as long as somaclonal variation does not interfere with phenotype of regenerated plants) thus facilitating the management of the supply of starting material for transformation experiments.<br>
indeed, the inventors have surprisingly found that Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton embryogenic callus, necessitated the addition of a plant phenolic compound, such as but not limited to acetosyringone, preferably at the cocultivation stage. Nowhere in the prior art has it been suggested that the inclusion of such a plant phenolic compound, of all possible vanables, would lead to successful Agrobacterium mediated transformation of cotton embryogenic callus.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to the use of a plant phenolic compound during the Agrobacterium-rr\ed\a\e6 transformation of cotton embryogenic callus.<br>
"Plant phenolic compounds" or "plant phenolics" suitable for the invention are those substituted phenolic molecules which are capable to induce a positive chemotactic response, particularly those who are capable to induce increased wrgene expression in a Ti-plasmid containing Agrobacterium sp., particularly a Ti-plasmid containing Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Methods for measuring chemotactic response towards plant phenolic compounds have been described by Ashby etal. (1988, J. Bacteriol. 170: 4181-4187) and methods to measure induction of vir gene expression are also well known (Stachel et al., 1985 Nature 318: 624-629; Bolton etal. 1986, Science 232: 983-985).<br>
Preferred plant phenolic compounds are those found in wound exudates of plant cells. One of the best known plant phenolic compounds is acetosyringone, which is present in a number of wounded and intact cells of various plants, albeit it in different concentrations. However, acetosyringone (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyacetophenone) is not the only plant phenolic which can induce the expression of vir genes. Other examples are a-hydroxy-acetosyringone, sinapinic acid (3,5 dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), syringic acid (4-hydroxy-3,5 dimethoxybenzoic acid), ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid), catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-hydroxybenzoic acid), P-resorcyiic acid (2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid), protocatechuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid), pyrrogallic acid (2,3,4 -trihydroxybenzoic acid) , gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) and vanillin (3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde), and these phenolic compounds are known or expected to be able to replace acetosyringone with similar results. As used herein, the mentioned molecules are also referred to as plant phenolic compounds.<br>
Plant phenolic compounds can be used either alone or in combination with other plant phenolics. Certain compounds, such as osmoprotectants (e.g. L-<br><br>
proline or betaine), phytohormes, {inter alia NAA), opines, or sugars, are expected to act synergistically wiien added in combination with plant phenolic compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for transforming a cotton plant, i.e. producing a transgenic cotton plant by introduction of a DNA fragment of interest into the genome of the cells of a cotton plant, wherein the method comprises :<br>
a)	cocultivating cotton embryogenic callus with Agrobacterium cells, said Agrobacterium cells comprising a DNA fragment of interest operably linked to at least one T-DNA border, in the presence of a plant phenolic compound, for a time sufficient to generate embryogenic callus comprising a transformed cotton cell; and<br>
b)	regenerating a transgenic cotton plant from said transformed cell.<br>
The methods provided by the invention employ cotton embryogenic callus as starting material for the cocultivation with the Agrobacterium cells. As used herein "cotton embryogenic callus" or "embryogenic callus derived from a cotton explants" refers to compact or solid callus tissue, cultivated on solid media, derived from a cotton explant, which can be regenerated into an intact cotton plant through somatic embryogenesis. This definition of embryogenic cotton callus does not include embryogenic suspension cells, cultured in liquid medium.<br>
Methods to induce embryogenic callus from a cotton explant have been disclosed in the art, e.g. in WO 97/12512.<br>
It will be clear for the skilled artisan, that the source of the cotton explant from which embryogenic callus has been derived is only of limited importance for the method of the current invention. Embryogenic callus may be derived from any suitable cotton explant such as but not limited to hypocotyls, cotyledons, immature or mature embryos etc.<br><br>
Preferably, the cotton embryogenic callus used in the transfornriation methods described herein, was obtained by incubation of cotton hypocotyl explants on hormone free callus induction medium as described in WO 97/12512.<br>
"Cocuitivation" is used herein to indicate the process of contacting between the embryogenic cotton callus and the Agrobacterium cells, prior to the addition of bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal compounds to inhibit or eliminate the Agrobacteria. The "cocuitivation stage" of an Agrobacterium mediated transformation method thus refers to the time period between the initial contacting of the Agrobacteria with the plant tissue, until the time point where a bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal compound is added to the medium with the intention to remove or inhibit the Agrobacterium strains comprising the DNA fragment of interest.<br>
"A DNA fragment of interest" is used herein to describe any DNA fragment which one would like to introduce into the genome of cells of a cotton plant, irrespective of whether it encodes a protein or polypeptide, RNA or not. Indeed, a DNA fragment may be introduced mainly for tagging purposes. The only prerequisite for the DNA fragment of interest is that it should be "operably linked to at least one T-DNA border".<br>
As used herein, "a T-DNA border" encompasses a DNA fragment comprising an about 25 nucleotide long sequence capable of being recognized by the virulence gene products of an Agrobacterium strain, preferably an A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes strain, and sufficient for transfer of the operably linked DNA to eukaryotic cells, preferably plant cells, particularly sufficient for transfer and integration of the operably linked DNA into the genome of a eukaryotic cell, preferably a plant cell. It is clear that this definition encompasses all naturally occurring T-DNA borders from wild-type plasmids, as well as any functional derivative thereof, including chemically synthesized T-DNA borders.<br>
Preferably, the DNA of interest is located between two T-DNA borders, preferably on T-DNA vector capable of forming a hybrid Ti-plasmid by single<br><br>
cross-over through a fragment of DNA homology between the T-DNA vector and the helper Ti-plasmid.<br>
The use of a plant phenolic compound according to the invention increases the transformation efficiency of Agrobacterium mediated DNA transformation of cotton embryogenic callus, and it is expected that this effect is independent of the chromosomal background of the Agrobacterium host, the type of Ti-plasmid, helper-plasmid or T-DNA vector used.<br>
Particularly preferred bacterial chromosomal backgrounds are provided by A. tumefaciens C58C1 (Van Larebeke et al., 1974, Nature 252: 169-170), A136 (Watson etal., 1975, J. Bacterid 123: 255-264) or LBA4011( Klapwijk et al., 1980, J. Bacterid 141, 128-136).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Agrobacterium strain used to transform the plant tissue precultured with the plant phenolic compound contains a LL-succinamopine type Ti-plasmid, preferably disarmed, such as pEHAIOI.<br>
The method of the invention can also be used in combination with particular Agrobacterium strains, to further increase the transformation efficiency, such as Agrobacterium strains wherein the vir gene expression and/or induction thereof is altered due to the presence of mutant or chimeric virA or virG genes (e.g. Hansen et al., 1994, supra; Chen and Winans, 1991, J. Bacterid. 173: 1139-1144; Scheeren-Groot etal., 1994, J. Bacterid. 176: 6418-6246).<br>
In another embodiment, Agrobacterium strains comprising an extra w7<b gene copies particularly the so-called super wkb derived from ptibo542 preferably linked to a multiple-copy plasmid may be used further increase transformation efficiency.></b>
V The concentration of the plant phenolic compound in the cocultivation medium is also believed to have an effect on the transformation efficiency. However, within certain concentration ranges, the effect is minimal. The optimal concentration range of plant phenolic compounds in the cocultivation medium<br><br>
may vary depending on the species or variety from which the cotton embryogenic callus is derived, but it is expected that about 100 |JM is a suitable concentration for many purposes. The optimal concentration may also depend on the nature of the specific plant phenolic compound used, particularly on its cell-division promoting strength.<br>
It was found for instance that the optimal concentration for acetosyringone is approximately 100 pM, but concentrations as low as approximately 25 pM can be used to obtain a good effect on transformation efficiency. Likewise, it is expected that higher concentrations up to approximately 400 pM will yield similar effects.<br>
Comparable concentrations apply to other plant phenolic compounds, and optimal concentrations can be established easily by experimentation in accordance with this invention.<br>
Typical co-cultivation times to generate an cotton embryogenic callus comprising transformed cells, are about 3 to about 4 days, but it is expected that a cociiltivation time of one day may be sufficient to generate at least some transformed cells. Further, it is expected that cocultivation times should not exceed about 7 days.<br>
it is clear for the skilled artisan that in addition to inclusion of a plant phenolic compound during cocultivation of cotton embryogenic callus with Agrobactehum cells, the used Agrobacterium cells may also be preinduced by incubation with a plant phenolic compound for a time sufficient to induce the virulence genes of the Agrobacterium cells.<br>
Moreover, it is expected that that preinduction of Agrobacterium ceils with a plant phenolic compound for a time sufficient to induce the virulence genes of the Agrobacterium cells, might obviate the requirement for inclusion of a plant phenolic compound during the cocultivation stage.<br><br>
Thus, in another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for transforming a cotton plant, i.e. producing a transgenic cotton plant by introduction of a DNA fragment of interest into the genome of the cells of a cotton plant, wherein the method comprises :<br>
a)	incubating an Agrobacterium cell culture comprising a DNA fragment of interest operably linked to at least one T-DNA border, with a plant phenolic compound, for a time sufficient to induce virulence genes of said Agrobacterium cells;<br>
b)	cocultivating embryogenic cellus derived from a cotton explant with said Agrobacterium cells incubated with said plant phenolic compound, so as to generate embryogenic callus comprising a transformed cotton cell; and<br>
c)	regenerating a transgenic cotton plant from said transformed cell.<br>
Methods to preinduce the virulence genes of Agrobacterium cells by incubation with a plant phenolic compounds, as well as methods to determine whether the virulence genes of an Agrobacterium strain are induced, are available in the art, e.g. as described by Stachel et al., 1985 or Bolton et al., 1986.<br>
Optimized methods for induction of Agrobacteria with plant phenolic compounds, particularly acetosyringone, have been described e.g. by Vernade etal., (1988, J. of Bacteriology 170: 5822-5829) incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The time of incubation of agrobacterial cells with a plant phenolic compound sufficient to induce the virulence genes may range from a few hours to about two days prior to cocuitivation, but typically about 1 day incubation prior to cocultivation will be sufficient. Likewise, concentration of the plant phenolic compound may range from about 50 pM to about 400 pM, but typically about 100 (JM will be a preferred concentration for the plant phenolic compound.<br><br>
After cocultivation, the cotton embryogenic callus is preferably submitted to a selection regime to separate transformed cells from untransformed cells or to at least enricfi for transformed cells.<br>
To this end, the foreign DNA used in the method of this invention preferably also comprises a marker gene, the expression of which allows the separation of transformed cells from non-transformed cells. Such a marker gene generally encodes a protein which allows to phenotypically distinguish transformed cells from untransformed ceils. In the case of a selectable marker gene, resistance to an antibiotic or other chemical compound that is normally toxic for the cells is generally provided to the cell by expression of that marker gene. In plants the selectable marker gene may thus also encode a protein that confers resistance to a herbicide, such as a herbicide comprising a glutamine synthetase inhibitor (e.g. phosphinothricin) as an active ingredient. An example of such genes are genes encoding phosphinothricin acetyl transferase such as the sfr or sfry genes {EP 0 242 236; EP 0 242 246; De Block et al., 1987, EMBO J. 6: 2513-2518). However, it can also be that the distinguishable phenotype cannot be selected for, as is the case for marker genes normally referred to a screenable marker genes, including but not limited to, green fluorescent proteins (GFP) or ^-glucuronidases (GUS) or |3-lactamases well known in the art.<br>
Moreover, using methods such as PCR-based DNA amplification methods, any DNA sequence, including part of the sequence of the DNA of interest, may be used as a tag for verification of the presence of the DNA fragment of interest.<br>
Selection of transformed embryogenic callus cells is preferably performed on solid media, but can also be supplemented or replaced by a selection phase in liquid medium.<br>
It goes without saying that during the selection and, if required, the regeneration  phase,   the  growth  of  Agrobacterium  has  to  be   inhibited,<br><br>
preferably the Agrobacterium cells have to be eliminated. This can be achieved, as well known in the art, by inclusion into the media of an antibiotic, toxic to Agrobacteria, such as but not limited to cefotaxime.<br>
Regeneration of the transformed embryogenic callus into transgenic cotton plant lines, can performed according to methods which are well within the skills of the art, such as but not limited to the regeneration methods described in WO 98/15622.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, small embryo"s are selected for germination and development into mature plants during the regeneration phase, preferably by growing the embryogenic callus in liquid medium on a gyratory shaker, and withholding for germination that fraction of the liquid suspension of embryogenic calli or somatic embryos which pass through a sieve, such as a tea-sieve.<br>
A transgenic " cotton plant line" as used herein, consists of a group of transgenic cotton plants, originating from one transformed embryogenic callus piece, obtained during the regeneration process. In general, plants from one plant line are genetically identical, and originate from one transformation event, thus comprising the same transgenes integrated at the same genomic positions. However, individual plants from one plant line can originate from independent transformation events when using Agrobacterium-medlaXed DNA transfer, and may thus differ from one another. When transformation frequencies are expressed by the number of plant lines / 100 initial embryogenic callus pieces, it may be that the actual transformation frequencies (transformation events/100 initial callus pieces) are even higher.<br>

Agrobacterium mediated transformation of embryogenic cotton callus.<br>
Embryogenic cotton callus was obtained in the following way:<br><br>
Cotton seeds of variety Coker 312 were disinfected using a 12% sodium hypochloride solution, and germinated individually in tubes containing a solution of gelrite 2/g/l H2O and 0.94 g/l MgCb.SHaO. The tubes were incubated in the dark at 27-28°C. After 10 to 14 days, seedlings are collected, the hypocotyls of the seedlings were cut in segments of about 1 cm and incubated on medium 104 (without plant hormones) at 28°C under a regime of 16hr light and 8 hr dark. Every three weeks, the segments were transferred to fresh medium, until embryogenic callus was formed (usually after about 9 weeks). This callus was removed from the explants and cultured further on medium 104.<br>
Agrobacterium strain A 3311 cells were grown on AB medium or MAG medium, collected and resuspended in Ml04 liquid medium, pH 5.2 (either with or without 100 pM acetosyringone (AS)) or MAG medium at a density of about 1 X 10^ CFU/ml. Small embryogenic cotton callus clumps were collected, washed in liquid medium 104 at pH 5.2, and immersed in the Agrobacterium suspension for about 20 minutes. The infected embryogenic calli were than transferred to solid medium 104, pH 5.2, supplemented with either 100" pM AS, 0.5 g/l casamino acids, 100 pM AS and 0.5 g/l casamino acids, or not supplemented at all, and incubated for cocultivation during 4 days in the dark at about 24 °C.<br>
After the cocultivation phase, the callus clumps were transferred to selective medium 104 supplemented with 50 mg/i kanamycin and 500mg/l Claforan.<br>
At different time intervals after the cocultivation, samples of embryogenic callus were collected and subjected to a jj-glucuronidase assay, using a chromogenic substrate as described by Jefferson et al. (1987; Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 5: 387-405). The results of these tests are summarized in table i, and are expressed as the percentage of calli expressing GUS-positive spots.<br><br>
As a control, experiments were included using tobacco leaf discs cocultivated with A3311, using mock-inoculated tobacco leaf discs or using mock-inoculated embryogenic cotton callus.<br>
It is clear from the results that inclusion of acetosyringone is required during Agrobacterium mediated transformation of embryogenic callus, both for transient expression and after prolonged cultivation of the transformed calli.<br><br>

Example  3:  Agrobacterium mediated  transformation  of  cotton  using embryogenic callus.<br>
Cotton embryogenic callus (EC) was generated as described in Example 2. Clumps of embryogenic callus were collected and washed in liquid medium 104 pH5.2<br>
Agrobacterium strains A3784, A3724 and A3727 were grown for 3 to 4 days on AB medium pH 7.0, collected and resuspended at a density of approximately 1 to 5 X 109 cells/ml in liquid medium 104, pH 5.2 containing 100 pM acetosyringone.<br>
Embryogenic callus clumps were immersed in the Agrobacterium suspension for maximum about 20 minutes, and transferred for cocultivation during 4 days in the dark at 24°C on solid medium 104, p H5.2 supplemented with 100 pM acetosyringone.<br>
After this cocultivation, the pieces of callus were transferred to a selective medium 104, pH 5.8, without acetosyringone or plant hormones, supplemented with 500 mg/l Claforan® (to inhibit the development of the Agrobacterium cells) and 5 mg/l phosphinotricin (PPT) (to select specifically for growth of transgenic calli).<br>
Healthy looking pieces of embryogenic callus, actively growing, were transferred every 3 weeks to fresh selective medium 104.<br>
Part of the callus (about 200mg) was resuspended in 20 ml liquid medium 100, supplemented with 5 mg/l PPT in a 100 ml flask on a rotary shaker (100-120 rpm)<br>
After two weeks culture in the liquid medium, large clumps were removed by passing the suspension through a tea-sieve. The fraction passed-through fraction of embryogenic suspension was left to settle for about 20 min, after<br><br>
which spent medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium 100. 2 ml of this suspension of small embryo"s were plated on solid medium 104, supplemented with 5 mg/l PPT and incubated at 28°C.<br>
After about 2 weeks, developing embryos with a size between 4 and 10 mm were transferred to medium 701 and further incubated in the dark at 28 °C . Smaller embryos were transferred to medium 104 overlaid with sterile filter paper (with or without 5 mg/L PPT) to allow increase in size, sufficient for transfer to medium 701.<br>
After about 2 weeks, the embryos were transferred to medium 702 (with or without selective pressure) for germination, and incubated at 28 °C, 16 hr light /8 hr dark.<br>
Well developed piantlets (which may require 2 to 3 transfers on medium 702) were transferred to small containers containing M700. When these piantlets have developed two to three true leaves they were transferred to bigger containers with medium 700.<br>
When the plants were about 10 cm in height, they were transferred to soil under greenhouse conditions.<br>
Molecular analyses (Phosphinotricin acetylation assay, Southern hybridization, and ELISA to detect cry gene expression if appropriate) were performed on the callus level.<br>
The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 2.<br>
