				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of monocondensed benzylidene cycloalkanones. More particularly it relates to the preparation of the monocondensed benzylidene cycloalkanones having general formula 1 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)-; X = cyano, nitro and hydroxy, synthesised from compound having general formula 2 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil,CH2-CH(CH3)-.<br>
The compounds prepared by the process of this invention are useful for the preparation of mesogens that would find applications in the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline pclymers. In particular, this invention describes a process for the preparation of monocondensed benzylidene cycloalkanones, that offers high regio-selectivity.<br>
Mesogens are moieties which form part of the polymeric structure ir. liquid crystalline polymers. If the mesogens form part of the backbone of the polymer, then the polymer is known as main chain liquid crystalline polymer and if it is in the form of pendant grcups along the backbone of the polymers, then the polymers are referred to as side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The mesogens prepared as per the process of this invention are useful fcr the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers that cculd be used for non-linear optical applications.<br>
The hitherto known processes for the preparation of benzylidene cycloalkanones involve the reaction of cycloalkanones with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of a base in a suitable<br><br>
solvent. These processes do not offer any regio selectivity to obtain mono condensed product and bis condensed products are obtained (J.Am.Chem.Soc. (1959), 628 and references cited therein). Another known process that offers regio selectivity to give monocondensed product involves the reaction of cyclohexene silyl enoi ether with aroiaatic aldehydes in the presence of titanium tetrachloride. This reaction offers exclusively monocondensed product. The known process however suffers from the following disadvantages : (J.Am.Chem.Soc. (1974), 96, 7503).<br>
1.	The reaction is two step process - the first one involves the formation of an intermediate aldol using a Lewis acid which is isolated followed by the second step of dehydration with the use of a Bronsted acid. Thus the process needs the use of two catalysts.<br>
2.	Equimolar amount of titanium tetrachloride needs to be added, though the function of titanium tetrachloride is that of a Lewis acid catalyst.<br>
3.	The catalyst, titanium tetrachloride is hygroscopic and hazardous to handle.<br>
4.	The catalyst cannot be recovered at the end of the reaction giving rise to disposal and environmental hazards.<br>
o<br>
5.	The reaction  is carried out at -78 C. It is  difficult to<br>
maintain this reaction condition in the laboratory. The main object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
Improved process for the preparation of monocondensed benzylidene cycloalkanones that eliminates the above mentioned disadvantages such as elimination of a second catalyst in the hitherto known process. Another object of the present invention is to provide a prcosess in which catalyst used in the process of this invention can be recovered and reused. Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of monocondensed benzylidene cycloalkanones of formula 1 shown in drawing accompanying with the specification which comprises : reacting silyl enol ether derivative of cycloalkanone of formula 2 of the drawing with aromatic aldehydes as herein described in the ratio 1.1:1 to 1.7 :1 (w/w) in an inert atmosphere in the presence of a solid super acid catalyst such as sulphated zirconia at a temperature in the range of 110 to 140 deg.C for a period ranging from 24 to 52 hrs, dispersing the reaction mixture in a aliphatic chlorinated solvent as herein described, filtering the reaction mixture to recover the super acid catalyst followed by washing the filtrate first with aliphatic chlorinated solvent and then with water, drying the filtrate over a conventional dehydrant as herein described, removing the chlorinated solvent under reduced pressure and purifying the product by column chromatography using an organic solvent system to get the pure monocondensed benzylidene cycloalkanones of formula 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
In one of the embodiment of the present invention the silyl enol used  may   be    such   as   silyl enol ether of cyclohexene, cyclopentene<br>
and 4-methyl cyclohexene.<br>
In another embodiment the aromatic aldehydes used may be such as 4-cyano benzaldehyde, 4-nitro benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the inert atmosphere may be maintained by using inert gas like nitrogen or<br>
argon.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the aliphatic chlorinated solvent used may be such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloro ethane.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the solid super-acid catalyst used may be such as sulphated zirconia.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the dehydrant used to dry the washed product may be such as sodium sulphate, magnesium sulphate.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the eluent mixture used for separation in chromatography may be such as petroleum ether : Acetone in the range of increasing polarity.<br>

The process of the present invention has following advantages : 1.   The  process  is  steroselective  in  addition  to  regio<br>
selective. In the reaction at temperatures in the range of 110 to 140°C/ preferential syn-selectivity is observed.<br>
2.	Sulphated zirconia acts both as Lewis acid and Bronsted acid and hence the process offers the use of a single catalyst.<br>
3.	The ' process can be carried out as a one pot synthesis for the preparation of monocondensed benzylidene cyclohexanones without the separation of the aldol formed first.<br>
4.	Sulphated zirconia as the super acid catalyst is used in small amounts compared to eguimolar quantities of the Lewis acid used as the catalyst in known processes.<br>
5.	The super-acid catalyst can be recovered and used repeatedly after activation. The process is thus environmentally clean.<br>
6.	The product obtained as per the process of this invention meets the stringent purity requirements for use as a mesogen in the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers for non-linear optical applications.<br>
7.	The process is amenable to scale up to meet the requirements which are usually small.<br><br><br><br><br>
