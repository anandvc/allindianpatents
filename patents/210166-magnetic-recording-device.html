BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording device having an improved spindle motor lubricant.<br>
2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
Current growth rates for digital magnetic recording data storage industry show a significant annual increase in recording densities and transfer rate and a decrease in seek time. To continue on this growth rate curve, the recording industry is being forced to make a number of significant changes in the design and operation of the magnetic recording device. Digital magnetic recording devices for data storage generally comprise a thin fib magnetic record disk, a spindle motor for rotating the disk, and a head or transducer which is moved along or above the surface of the rotating disk to read and write information on the disk. The thin film magnetic recording disks generally comprise a substrate, a magnetic layer such as a cobalt-based metal alloy, a protective amorphous carbon layer and a layer of perfluoropolyether disposed on the carbon overcoat. The magnetic recording disks are mounted on a spindle motor which rotates the disk at a high rotational speed. The spindle motor generally comprises (i) a spindle shaft attached to a housing, (ii) a spindle hub rotatably mounted on the shaft, and (iii) lubricated ball bearings positioned in races formed in the shaft and/or hub.<br>
The head or transducer is attached to a carrier or slider having an air bearing surface which is supported during operation adjacent the data surface of the disk by a cushion of air generated by the rotating disk.<br><br>
The recording device also comprises a positioning actuator connected to the carrier for<br>
moving the head to the desired location on the disk during reading or writing<br>
operations.<br>
Conventional magnetic recording devices are operated at a rotational speed of about<br>
3,600 RPM to 7,000 RPM. It has been discovered that during normal operation of the<br>
disk drive at higher rotational speeds, e.g., more than 7,500 RPM, the recording<br>
device begins to undergo acoustic vibrations associated with chemical breakdown of<br>
the spindle bearing grease lubricant within a short period of time. Continued operation<br>
of the recording device in the presence of the acoustic vibrations leads to mechanical<br>
failure of the spindle bearing.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved magnetic recording<br>
device which operates for extended periods of time at higher rotational speeds without<br>
unacceptable acoustic vibrations.<br>
Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a digital magnetic recording data storage device which<br>
can operate effectively at high rotational speeds. The magnetic recording device of the<br>
present invention comprises (a) a magnetic recording disk; (b) a spindle motor<br>
associated with the disk operable for rotating the disk at selected rotational speeds of<br>
3,000 RPM to more than7,000 RPM, e.g., around 10,000-20,000 RPM; (c) a head<br>
supported on an air bearing carrier (head and carrier are an integral member) for<br>
magnetically writing data to or magnetically reading data from the magnetic layer on<br>
the disk; and (d) an actuator connected to the head carrier for moving the head across<br><br>
the rotating disk. The spindle motor is preferably a brushless direct current spindle<br>
motor comprising (i) a spindle shaft attached to a housing, (ii) a spindle hub rotatably<br>
mounted on the shaft, and (iii) ball bearings positioned in races formed in the shaft<br>
and/or hub and lubricated by an improved grease. The improved grease is the key<br>
feature of the present invention. The improved grease comprises a polymeric amine<br>
and bis or tris (alkyl phenyl)phosphate. The grease improves the rotational operation<br>
ofthe disk drive.<br>
A more thorough disclosure of the present invention is presented in the detailed<br>
description ofthe invention which follows and the accompanying figures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved high performance digital magnetic<br>
recording device for reading and viding data magnetically.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown a magnetic recording disk drive of the<br>
present invention. The magnetic recording disk 2 is rotated by spindle motor 4 with<br>
hub 6, which is attached to the drive motor. The disk generally comprises a substrate,<br>
a metallic magnetic layer, an optional carbon layer and a bonded or non-bonded<br>
polymeric layer, e.g., perfluoropolyether.<br><br>
A read/write head or transducer 8 is formed on the trailing end of a carrier, or slider 10. Suitable sliders are positive or negative air bearing sliders. Suitable negative air bearing sliders are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,894,740 and 5,438,467 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Head 8 may be an inductive read and write transducer or an inductive write transducer with a magnetoresistive read transducer. The slider 10, is connected to the actuator 12 by means of a rigid arm 14 and suspension 16. The suspension 16 provides a bias force which urges the slider 10 onto the surface of the recording disk 2.<br>
During operation of the disk drive, the spindle motor 4 rotates the disk 2 at a constant speed in the direction of arrow 22; and the actuator 12, which is typically a linear or rotary motion coil motor, moves the slider 10 generally radially across the surface of the disk 2 so that the read/write head may access different data tracks on disk 2. Referring to FIG. 3, heads 20 and 22 are connected to actuator 24 by means of arms 26 and 28 and suspensions 30 and 32. Disk 34 is supported on hub or rotor 38, which is rotatably mounted on shaft 40. Shaft 40 is supported on housing 42. A plurality of permanent magnets (e.g., 60 and 62) as sections of an annular ring magnet are attached to hub 38. Stator 64 has a plurality of axial posts 66 and 68 and coils 70 and 72 disposed around the posts. Magnets 60 and 62 are preferably made of high moment magnetic material such as neodymium-iron-boron or samarium-cobalt. The annular ring magnet comprises a plurality of individual magnet sections with magnetic fields which alternatively point radially outwardly and inwardly around the ring. When an electrical current is applied to each coil of the stator, a magnetic field is induced which attracts or repels the permanent ijiagnet sections to cause rotation of the hub.<br><br>
An annular race is formed between hub 38 and shaft 40. Suitably the annular race comprises inner races 44 and 46 which are attached to and part of shaft 40 and outer races 48 and 50 which are attached to and part of hub 38. Ball bearings 52, 54, 56 and 58 are disposed in the annular race track formed by races 44, 46, 48 and 50. Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown an in-hub brushless DC spindle motor comprising shaft 80 and hub 82 having lip 84 for supporting the disk. The shaft has inner races 86 and 88 and hub has outer races 90 and 92. Permanent magnet sections 94 and 96 are attached to hub 80. Coils 98 and 100 of stator are attached to shaft 80. Other suitable spindle motors are known to those skilled in the art, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,502,605, 4,841,393, 5,448,119, 4,841,393 and 5,296,981, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
The annular race is in contact with a unique lubricating grease which lubricates the ball bearings moving in the race. The grease generally comprises a polymeric aromatic amine and bis or tris (alkyl phenyl)phosphate.<br>
The first component of the present invention is a polymeric amine, preferably an amine copolymer. The amine copolymer is formed by reacting an akylated diphenylamine with phenybiapthylamine or an alkylated phenylnapthylamine. Suitable alkylated diphenyl amines have one or more lower alkyl (C MO) substituents on one or both of the phenyl rings. Preferably, the substituents are (C 6-9), more preferably octyl substituents. Preferably, the amine has 1-3 substituents, e.g., mono, di or tri octyl substituents. A preferred amine reactant is di-octyl diphenyl amine. Suitable alkylated phenyl napthyl amines have one or more lower alkyl (C MO) substituents on one or both of the aromatic rings. Preferably, the substituents are C 6-9 <br><br>
more preferably octyl substituents. Preferably, the amine has 1-3 substituents, e.g., mono, di or tri octyl substituents. A preferred amine reactant is N-phenyl-1-naphthyl amine or N-(p-octyl phenyl)-!-naphthyl amine. Suitable polymeric amine is the copolymer of dioctyldiphenylamine and acetylated phenyl .alpha.-naphthyl amine. In an alternative embodiment, the alkylated diphenyl amine and alkylated phenyl napthyl amine can be co-polymerized with other monomers, e.g., unsubstituted phenyl naphthyl amine.<br>
Suitably, the reaction to form the polymeric amine is catalyzed by an organic peroxide and elevated temperature under nitrogen. Suitably, the amine polymers have a number average degree of polymerization of from about 2 to about 10, preferably about 4 to about 7. Suitably, diarylamine A and diarylamine B starting components are mixed with an ester lubricant or a hydrocarbon solvent under inert atmosphere. The weight of ester lubricant or hydrocarbon solvent is the same as the total weight of diarylamines. The mixture is heated to between 14020 °C. to 150 ""C. A t-butyl peroxide (1.3 x the total moles of diarylamine) is added dropwise over a 1/2 to 1 hour time period. The t-butyl alcohol reaction product of the t-butyl peroxide is distilled off while maintaining the temperature at 140 °C. to 150 *^C. for up to 5 hours. The temperature is then raised to between 170 °C. to 180 *^C. to remove low molecular weight impurities. The resulting mixture is a low molecular weight amine polymer in ester oil. Preferably less than 10 mole of the total diarylamines are chemically condensed with the ester lubricants or other reaction solvents.<br>
The second component of the grease is bis or tris (lower C i.6 alkyl phenyl)phosphate. A suitable phosphate is tri cresyl phosphate (TCP). Other suitable phosphates include<br><br>
phosphorus-containing acid ester component which may be selected from triesters of phosphoric acid with alcohols such as straight and branched chain aliphatic alcohols having from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms. Typically these esters are triethyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate and triisooctyl phosphate. Other suitable phosphoric acid esters include esters of phenol and naphthol. These esters may have from 1 to about 3   alkyl substitutents on one or more of the aryl moieties. Exemplary of these esters are tracery phosphate, tri-phenyl phosphate, and so on.<br>
The grease of the present invention comprises an oil and a thickener. Suitable oils include ester oils (e.g., synthetic ester oils) and mineral oils (e.g., polyalpha loaf oil). Preferably, tiie oil is an ester oil. The ester oil may have chain branching and may have some unreacted hydroxyl groups. Suitable ester oils are di-C j.io alkyl (e.g., dioctyl, dibutyl, diethyl, hexyl) sebacate, pentaerythritol tetra esters of C MO carboxylic acids, tri-C i.6 alkyl and trimethylol propane triheptanoate and triglycerides. Suitable ester oils have the formula: C(CH2 00C(CH2)x CH3) 4 where x is 1-10. A preferred ester oil is pentaerythritol tetrapentanoate. Suitable thickener, such as fatty acid salts and polyurea, will be known to those skilled in the art. Suitable fatty acid surfactants include alkali or alkaline (e.g., lithium, sodium, calcium, barium)  preferably C 16-20) fatty acid salts optionally having one or more hydroxy substituents. A preferred surfactant is lithium 12 hydroxysterate. Other surfactants include alkali palpitate and alkali isocyanate (C20).<br>
The grease will generally comprise about 90 weight % of oil and about 10 weight % of thickener. The grease of the present invention will preferably comprise about 0.5 to about 5 weight % of the polymeric amine (preferably about 1 to about 4 weight %)<br><br>
and about 0.1 to about 5 weight % of the phosphate (preferably about 1 to about 2<br>
weight %).<br>
Surprisingly, the synergistic interaction of the grease components enables long term<br>
high speed operation of the magnetic recording device without degradation of<br>
performance.   Other minor components  (e.g.,  less  than  5  weight %),  such as<br>
antioxidants   (e.g.,   zinc   diamyldithiocarbamate),   metal   deactivators   (e.g.,   N,N'-<br>
disalicylidene-l,2-propanediamine), anti-wear agents, corrosion inhibitors and other<br>
additives, known to those skilled in the art, can also be added to the grease.<br>
The following examples are detailed descriptions of the present invention. The<br>
detailed descriptions fall within the scope of, and serve to exemplify, the more<br>
generally described invention set forth above. The examples are presented for<br>
illustrative purposes only, and are not intended as a restriction on the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Two lubricant compositions were tested for stability. Each lubricant composition<br>
comprised   the   copolymer   amine   of   the   present   invention   (copolymer   of<br>
phenylnapthylamine and dioctyldiphenylamine) and one had TCP. Each lubricant<br>
composition was placed in a 50 ml pyrex beaker and covered with tin foil. A 5 mm<br>
hole in the center of the tin foil allowed periodic sampling for analysis. Clean ball<br>
bearings were immersed in the composition. The compositions were monitored by UV<br>
spectroscopy, and failure was detected by sudden absorbance between 200-300 nm.<br>
The results are shore in the table below. It can be seen from the results that the<br><br>
composition having both the polymeric amine and the  ICP exhibited synergistic improvement in satiety.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
