				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to communications networks, and in<br>
particular, to the delivery of media data such as television (TV) channels to TV sets<br>
connected to an Internet Protocol (IP) network.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) enables Set-Top-Boxes (STBs) connected to<br>
an IP network to obtain delivery of TV channels and to access video content through the<br>
IP network. IP provides two delivery mechanisms: unicast and multicast. Unicast is more<br>
appropriate for Video-on-Demand (VoD) services, while multicast is more efficient for<br>
delivering TV channels.<br>
In the Internet draft by T. Einarsson, et al., "Multiple aggregated control URIs for<br>
RTSP", IETF Draft, June 2006, it was shown that fast channel switching is feasible over<br>
unicast. However, an IPTV solution using unicast for delivering TV channels will not<br>
scale with the number of users and is thus not feasible. While multicast is the right choice<br>
for delivering live TV channels to multiple users, it has the drawback of requiring the<br>
processing of Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) JOIN/LEAVE commands for<br>
channel switching, and this processing introduces delays and network-resource problems.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an improved system and method of delivering<br>
media data such as TV channels over an IP network. The present invention provides such<br>
a system and method together with a media edge proxy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a media edge proxy which combines the<br>
advantages of unicast for fast channel switching with the advantages of multicast as an<br>
efficient channel distribution mechanism. The invention reduces the channel switching<br>
delay and thus improves quality-of-experience for the end-user. The invention also avoids<br>
excessive IGMP JOIN/LEAVE signaling when a user switches quickly through channels.<br>
Thus in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of providing<br>
media channels to a media client. The method includes the steps of receiving from the<br>
media client, a request for media data from an identified media channel; obtaining the<br>
 <br>
media data from a media server utilizing a temporary unicast connection; and providing<br>
the media data received from the server to the media client for an initial time period.<br>
Upon determining that the initial time period has expired, the method includes obtaining<br>
the media data from a multicast router; providing the media data received from the router<br>
to the media client; and releasing the temporary unicast connection with the media server.<br>
The media channels may be, for example, IPTV or Internet radio channels.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a media edge proxy for<br>
providing media channels to a media client. The media edge proxy includes a channel<br>
switch interface for receiving from the media client, a request for media data from an<br>
identified media channel; a unicast interface for receiving the requested media data from a<br>
media server; a multicast interface for receiving the requested media data from a multicast<br>
router; and a controlling proxy unit connected to the channel switch interface, the unicast<br>
interface, and the multicast interface. The controlling proxy unit is adapted to obtain the<br>
requested media data from the media server utilizing a temporary unicast connection; and<br>
provide the requested media data received from the server to the media client for an initial<br>
time period. Upon determining that the initial time period has expired, the controlling<br>
proxy unit obtains the media data from the multicast router; provides the requested media<br>
data received from the router to the media client; and releases the temporary unicast<br>
connection with the server.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a system for providing<br>
requested media data to a media client. The system includes a media server for providing<br>
the requested media data utilizing a temporary unicast connection; a multicast router for<br>
providing the requested media data utilizing a multicast connection; and a media edge<br>
proxy for controlling delivery of the requested media data to the media client. The media<br>
edge proxy includes a unicast interface for receiving the requested media data from the<br>
media server utilizing the temporary unicast connection; a multicast interface for receiving<br>
the requested media data from the multicast router utilizing the multicast connection; a<br>
channel switch interface for sending the requested media data to the media client; and a<br>
controlling proxy unit connected to the unicast interface, the multicast interface, and the<br>
channel switch interface. The controlling proxy unit is adapted to obtain the requested<br>
media data from the media server utilizing a temporary unicast connection; and provide<br>
the requested media data received from the server to the media client for an initial time<br>
 <br>
period. Upon determining that the initial time period has expired, the controlling proxy<br>
unit obtains the media data from the multicast router; provides the requested media data<br>
received from the router to the media client; and releases the temporary unicast connection<br>
with the server.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a media edge proxy which combines the<br>
advantages of unicast for fast channel switching with the advantages of multicast as an<br>
efficient channel distribution mechanism. Although the invention is described herein<br>
primarily in terms of IPTV channels, the invention is applicable to other types of media<br>
channels such as Internet radio channels and the like.<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of an IP-network architecture 10 suitable for<br>
delivering IPTV channels to IPTV Set-Top-Boxes (STBs) 11 in accordance with<br>
exemplary embodiments of the system of the present invention. The STBs include a<br>
media client 12, and multiple STBs may connect to a home network 13. The home<br>
network connects through a Residential Gateway (GW) 14 to a Digital Subscriber Line<br>
 <br>
Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) 15. The DSLAM connects to an aggregation network 16<br>
via a nearby Media Edge Proxy (MEP) 17.<br>
When a user activates television reception, the IPTV STB 11 establishes a control<br>
connection to the MEP 17 over unicast, either directly with the MEP or indirectly via the<br>
Residential GW 14. In the following description, the term "STB/GW" is used to indicate<br>
from the perspective of the MEP, either a direct connection from the STB or a connection<br>
from the STB via the Residential GW. Typically the Real-Time Streaming Protocol<br>
(RTSP) is used for controlling the unicast connection, but other protocols suitable for<br>
connection control, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), may be utilized as well.<br>
Without limiting the present invention, RTSP is discussed in the following exemplary<br>
description.<br>
When the STB/GW connects via RTSP to the MEP 17, the MEP establishes a<br>
unicast connection to a media server 18. Without loss of generality, FIG. 1 also shows the<br>
use of RTSP between the MEP and the media server, although other protocols such as SIP<br>
may be utilized as well. The STB/GW then requests a channel. This may be<br>
accomplished, for example, by utilizing RTSP PLAY requests inside an RTSP session to<br>
request a new TV channel (content source) via the RTSP front end in the media server.<br>
The MEP 17 checks whether the requested channel is locally available on a multicast<br>
channel. If yes, the MEP starts forwarding packets to the media client 12 over the already<br>
established unicast connection as soon as the MEP receives multicast packets of the<br>
requested channel.<br>
If the requested channel is not locally available on a multicast channel, the MEP 17<br>
requests the channel from the media server over a unicast RTSP connection. While<br>
requesting the channel via RTSP from the media server 18, the MEP also sends an IGMP<br>
JOIN request message to a Multicast Router 27 requesting a multicast connection for the<br>
requested channel. An IGMP JOIN inhibit timer triggers the IGMP JOIN request message<br>
only if the requested channel has been delivered to the STB 11 via the unicast connection<br>
for more than a predefined period of time (for example, 30 seconds). As soon as the<br>
requested channel becomes available over multicast, the MEP starts forwarding the<br>
packets to the STB and tells the media server 18 to release the unicast connection and stop<br>
sending data.<br>
 <br>
If the STB 11 stops using a channel, it sends a request to the MEP 17. The MEP<br>
immediately stops forwarding the media packets belonging to that channel. If an IGMP<br>
JOIN request was issued previously, the MEP sends an IGMP LEAVE request to the<br>
Multicast Router 27. An IGMP LEAVE inhibit timer triggers the LEAVE request only if<br>
the channel has not been requested by the same media client over a longer period of time<br>
(for example, 5 minutes). If channel data was received from the media server 18 via<br>
unicast, a STOP command is sent to the media server.<br>
FIG. 2 is a message sequence diagram illustrating an embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention in which an STB 11 or a Residential GW 14 requests a channel,<br>
which is not currently available over multicast at the MEP 17. It is assumed that an RTSP<br>
session has been established already between the STB and the MEP and between the MEP<br>
and the media server by using the well known sequence of RTSP SETUP messages. The<br>
invention provides a temporary unicast connection to give quick access to TV channels<br>
requested by a media client, and then rolls over from unicast to multicast reception as soon<br>
as possible to avoid excessive usage of unicast resources.<br>
The STB/GW sends an RSTP PLAY message 21 to the MEP 17, which forwards<br>
the message to the Media Server 18. The RSTP PLAY message identifies a requested<br>
channel (channel #x). The Media Server returns an RSTP OK message 22, which the<br>
MEP forwards to the STB/GW. At 23, the Media Server then sends media data for<br>
channel #x over unicast to the MEP. At 24, the MEP forwards the media data, which was<br>
received over unicast from the media server, to the STB 11. After a predefined time<br>
period, the MEP determines at 25 that channel #x has been delivered for N seconds. The<br>
MEP then sends an IGMP JOIN request message 26 identifying channel #x to the<br>
Multicast Router 27. At 28, the Multicast Router begins forwarding the media data to the<br>
MEP over multicast. The receipt of the media data indicates to the MEP at 29 that channel<br>
#x is available over multicast, and at 31, the MEP begins forwarding the media data,<br>
which was received via multicast from the multicast router, to the STB 11. At 32, the<br>
MEP sends an RTSP PAUSE message identifying channel #x to the Media Server. At 33,<br>
unicast delivery of the media data between the Media Server and the MEP is stopped.<br>
FIG. 3 is a message sequence diagram for the case in which the STB 11 receives a<br>
first channel (channel #x) and switches to a second channel (channel #y). It is assumed<br>
that channel #y is available over multicast in this case.  Otherwise, the message sequence<br>
6<br>
 <br>
shown in FIG. 2 is used to give quick access to channel #y via an RTSP unicast<br>
connection.<br>
At 35, the Multicast Router 27 is forwarding media data for channel #x over<br>
multicast to the MEP 17. At 36, the MEP forwards the media data for channel #x received<br>
over multicast to the STB 11. At 37, the Multicast Router also forwards media data for<br>
channel #y to the MEP. In certain situations channel #y is available at the MEP although<br>
the STB has not requested it. The system may have been configured such that all channels<br>
are always broadcasted in the backbone, or another STB may have previously requested<br>
channel #y. At 38, the STB sends an RTSP PLAY message to the MEP requesting<br>
channel #y. At 39, the MEP stops forwarding media data for channel #x to the STB, and<br>
at 41, the MEP starts forwarding media data for channel #y to the STB 11. After a<br>
predefined time period, the MEP determines at 42 that channel #x has not been delivered<br>
for M seconds. The MEP then sends an IGMP LEAVE request message 43 identifying<br>
channel #x to the Multicast Router.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating the steps of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
method of the present invention, as executed by a unicast/multicast proxy function at the<br>
MEP. In this example, channel #x is currently being forwarded to the STB 11 when the<br>
user enters a request for channel #y. LEAVE and JOIN requests are entered into a timer<br>
queue. Entries in this queue are de-queued and executed when an associated timer<br>
expires. By de-queuing an entry, the associated timer is canceled. The use of special logic<br>
and inhibit timers prevents the sending of IGMP JOIN/LEAVE messages when a user<br>
rapidly changes channels because only the unicast connection is used during rapid channel<br>
changes.<br>
At step 45, the MEP 17 receives a request for channel #y from the STB 11. At step<br>
46, it is determined whether or not forwarding of another channel, such as channel #x, is<br>
already in progress. If so, the method moves to step 47 where the MEP stops forwarding<br>
media data for channel #x. At step 48, it is determined whether or not channel #x was<br>
forwarded from multicast. If not, the method moves to step 49 where the MEP sends a<br>
STOP request for channel #x to the Media Server 18. At step 51, the MEP de-queues the<br>
JOIN request for channel #x. The method then moves to step 52 where the MEP dequeues<br>
the LEAVE request for channel #y, if such a LEAVE request had been entered<br>
earlier.   However, if it is determined at step 48 that channel #x was forwarded from<br>
 <br>
multicast, the method moves instead to step 53 where the MEP queues a LEAVE request<br>
for channel #x at time "NOW + M" seconds. The method then moves to step 52 where the<br>
MEP de-queues the LEAVE request for channel #y, if it had been entered before.<br>
The method then moves to step 54 where it is determined whether or not channel<br>
#y is available on multicast. If so, the method moves to step 55 where the MEP 17<br>
receives the media data for channel #y from the Multicast Router 27 and forwards the<br>
media data over multicast to the STB 11 and Media Client 12. However, if channel #y is<br>
not available on multicast, the method moves instead to step 56 where the MEP sends a<br>
START request for channel #y to the Media Server 18. At step 57, the MEP receives<br>
media data for channel #y over unicast from the Media Server and forwards the data at<br>
step 58 to the STB and Media Client. At step 59, the MEP queues a JOIN request for<br>
channel #y at time "NOW + N" seconds. At step 61, it is determined whether or not<br>
channel #y is available on multicast. If not, the method continues to wait until channel #y<br>
is available on multicast. When channel #y is available on multicast, the method moves to<br>
step 62 where the MEP stops the unicast connection by sending a STOP request for<br>
channel #y to the Media Server. At step 63, the MEP forwards media data for channel #y<br>
received over multicast to the STB and Media Client.<br>
FIG. 5 is a simplified block diagram of a MEP 17 configured in accordance with<br>
the present invention. The MEP includes a channel switch interface 65, a multicast<br>
interface 66, and a unicast interface 67. The channel switch interface is for signaling and<br>
sending media data to and from the Media Client 12 in the STB 11. The channel switch<br>
communications may optionally pass through the Residential GW 14. The multicast<br>
interface is for signaling and sending media data to and from the Multicast Router 27 in<br>
the aggregation network 16. In one exemplary embodiment, the multicast interface uses<br>
IGMP signaling. The unicast interface is for signaling and sending media data to and from<br>
the Media Server 18. In exemplary embodiments, the unicast interface uses RTSP or SIP<br>
signaling.<br>
Logic in a coordinating proxy unit 68 determines if and when unicast or multicast<br>
communications are established with the Media Client 12 in accordance with the flow<br>
diagram illustrated in FIG. 4. Inhibit timers Timer-M 69 and Timer-N 71 provide queuing<br>
times for JOIN/LEAVE messages when the proxy unit switches from a temporary unicast<br>
connection to a multicast connection with the Media Client.<br>
 <br>
The present invention may of course, be carried out in other specific ways than<br>
those herein set forth without departing from the essential characteristics of the invention.<br>
The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and<br>
not restrictive and all changes coming within the meaning and equivalency range of the<br>
appended claims are intended to be embraced therein.<br>

15.	The system as recited in claim 14, wherein the media edge proxy also<br>
includes a second timer for determining a second time period for stopping delivery of the<br>
media data for the first identified media channel after switching the media client to a<br>
second identified channel.<br>
<br>
A system, method, and media edge proxy, MEP, (17) for providing media data such as<br>
Internet Protocol Television, IPTV, or Internet radio channels to a media client (12). The<br>
MEP obtains the media data from a media server (18) utilizing a temporary unicast<br>
connection and provides the media data obtained from the server to the media client for an<br>
initial time period. Upon determining that the initial time period has expired, the MEP<br>
obtains the media data via multicast from a multicast router (27), provides the media data<br>
obtained from the router to the media client, and releases the temporary unicast<br>
connection. The invention reduces channel switching delay and thus improves quality-of-<br>
experience for the end-user. The invention also avoids excessive IGMP JOIN/LEAVE<br>
signaling when a user switches quickly through channels.</td>
