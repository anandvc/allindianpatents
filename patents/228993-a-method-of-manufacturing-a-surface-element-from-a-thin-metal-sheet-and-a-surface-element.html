METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SURFACE ELEMENT, AND SURFACE ELEMENT<br>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a surface element from a thin metal sheet.<br>
The invention further relates to a surface element formed of a thin metal sheet.<br>
Surface elements made of thin metal sheets are used for various purposes to form a facing e.g. in buildings, in ships and other vehicles. Such a surface element is typically manufactured by bending a metal sheet into a predetermined shape and by coating it thereafter with suitable paint. A problem in the manufacture of such elements is that the thickness of the metal sheet affects the rigidity and behaviour of the element, as well as the acoustics. Particularly when the elements should be made larger, with the present technique it is necessary to increase the thickness of the metal sheet to obtain sufficient rigidity and other properties.<br>
An objective of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a surface element, and a surface element, which enable the use of a thinner metal sheet than previously, while providing an element with better properties than in the prior art arrangements.<br>
The method according to the invention is characterized in that the surface of the metal sheet is covered by at least one substantially parallel reinforcing element, and a thermoplastic surface layer forming a facing is glued onto the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements by pressing the plastic layer against the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements and by heating the surface layer during the gluing so that it conforms substantially to the outer surface formed by the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements and fastens the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements together, thus forming the surface element with them.<br>
Further, the surface element according to the invention is characterized in that on the surface of the metal sheet there is at least one reinforcing element substantially parallel with the surface, and a thermoplastic surface layer is glued onto the surface of the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements, the plastic layer being pressed substantially against the outer surface formed by the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements so that it fastens the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements together, thus forming the surface element with them.<br><br>
According to a basic idea of the invention, on the outer surface of a thin metal sheet there are one or more reinforcing elements, whereafter a thermoplastic surface layer, such as a plastic film or plastic sheet, is glued to the outer surface formed by the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements, the plastic layer being heated during gluing and pressed against the outer surface of the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements such that it conforms thereto, thus affixing the reinforcing elements and the metal sheet together and forming a surface element with them.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, reinforcing elements are made of incombustible material, such as profiles formed of a thin metal sheet, wherefore such a surface element can also be used in places that require a high standard of fire safety, e.g. in public premises and in vehicles, such as ships. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the reinforcing elements are made of MDF, such as MDF sheets, through machining.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a surface element according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically a cross-sectional view of a part of the surface element according to Figure 1 taken along the line A-A,<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically an advantageous cross-section of a reinforcing element,<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show schematically examples of perforated metal sheets applicable for manufacturing a surface element, and<br>
Figure 5 shows an embodiment of a surface element according to the invention viewed from the side of the facing.<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a surface element 1 according to the invention viewed from the side of the facing. Below the plastic surface layer provided on the surface of the element and shown in Figure 2, the element comprises reinforcing profiles denoted by arrows 2 in Figure 1, the profiles forming a pattern on the surface of the surface element 1. Depending on the shape of the reinforcing elements 2 and on the location thereof with respect to one another, various patterns can be formed on the surface of the surface element. The patterns can be selected in various ways depending on the required level of reinforcement and the desired appearance.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows schematically a partial cross-section of the surface element according to Figure 1. As shown in the figure, the frame of the surface ilement consists of a metal sheet 3 bent e.g. into the same form as in the fig-ire. The shape can vary depending on the type of fasteners used to affix the surface element to the base, and it may comprise various projections, shoul-lers, openings etc.<br>
On top of the metal sheet 3 there are reinforcing elements 2, which ire shaped e.g. like crescents by way of an example, but the cross-section hereof can vary within the limits set by the desired effect and rigidity. The rein-orcing elements 2 and the metal sheet 3 are covered by a plastic surface layer I- which constitutes the facing and is attached by gluing to the metal sheet 3 ind the reinforcing elements 2 by heating the surface layer 4 and pressing it against the surface of the metal sheet 3 and the reinforcing elements 2, so that certain parts of the surface element stretch as a result of the heat, thus con-orming to the shapes of the surfaces.<br>
The plastic surface layer 4 can be glued in various ways. It can be &gt;ressed against the surface of the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements by neans of a pressure difference that can be generated either by rapidly sucking air from the other side of the metal sheet or by providing a higher pressure han the atmospheric pressure on the surface facing the surface layer. Natu-ally, a combination of these methods can also be used. Furthermore, the sur-ace layer 4 can be pressed in place by means of a separate press element, vhich mechanically presses the surface layer against the metal sheet 3 and he reinforcing element 2 until the layer has assumed a desired shape. In all ;ases, the surface layer must naturally be heated in connection with the gluing o make it conform to the surface so that the film is able to adhere thereto. The elastic surface layer can be e.g. a PVC sheet or some other suitable plastic llm with appropriate heat-dependent plasticity properties, and suitable durabil-ty and appearance for the intended purpose. Correspondingly, the plastic sur-:ace layer can be formed e.g. of a thin plastic sheet, such as an acryl sheet or tie like. The gluing can be carried out by means of heat-activated or compression-activated adhesive or e.g. moisture-activated urethane adhesive, depend-ng on the required properties and conditions of use.<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically a preferred embodiment of a reinforc-ng profile formed by bending a very thin metal sheet into a profile that consti-:utes a reinforcing element. The reinforcing element is thus firm yet light and<br><br>
incombustible. Such profiles can be manufactured with various cross-sections, and a simple example thereof is shown in Figure 3. A reinforcing profile can be manufactured not only by bending but also though extrusion or in some other manner known per se.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show schematically two alternatives of a perforated metal sheet, which can be used to manufacture a surface element according to the invention. Figure 4a shows a metal sheet perforated with substantially evenly spaced small holes 5, through which air is able to flow between the plastic film and the metal sheet. Figure 4b in turn shows an embodiment where broken lines denote locations 2a of the reinforcing elements, and a few holes 5 which can be located in different manners, but which are placed in this case near the reinforcing element. The number and size of the holes can vary considerably, as long as the metal sheet is provided with holes, if required, through which air can be discharged from between the plastic surface layer 4 and the metal sheet 3 while the surface layer is being pressed to the metal sheet.<br>
Figure 5 shows schematically yet another embodiment of a surface element according to the invention. In this embodiment, the reinforcing element Z consists of a netlike structure shown in the figure as a grid by way of an example. The operation of such a netlike structure as a reinforcing element is similar to other reinforcing elements, and it adheres to the metal sheet by means of a plastic surface layer similarly as the other reinforcing elements. When this embodiment is applied in connection with larger surface elements, in particular, any small deformations occurring in a surface element as a result of thermal variation are almost unnoticeable since there are no large and uniform reflecting surfaces in the surface elements due to such a netlike structure. A netlike reinforcing element can consist of for example crosswise threads made of a suitable material, or it can be a woven net or some other net formed in a suitable manner.<br>
In the arrangement according to the invention, the material of the surface element can be steel, aluminium or some other metal suitable for the purpose. The reinforcing elements can be manufactured e.g. from wood, various rigid materials made of fibres, such as MDF sheets, or plastic or metal, depending on the intended use and the fire safety regulations in the destination. With respect to the prior art arrangements, the invention enables the use of a metal sheet that is up to 50% thinner for the manufacture of a surface<br><br>
element, while providing surface elements with better properties, however. The most advantageous method is to preform metal sheets into a desired shape of the surface elements before the reinforcing elements and the surface layer are attached thereto. In principle, a surface element can also be a straight sheet if it is attached to a suitable place either by means of profiles or some other suitable fasteners, such as screws. What is essential is that the surface of the metal sheet is provided with reinforcing elements, and that a thermoplastic surface layer is attached onto the surface of both the metal sheet and the reinforcing elements to affix the sheet and the elements together, thus forming a surface element with them. The reinforcing elements can be placed on the surface of the metal sheet without any substantial fastening, since the plastic surface layer affixes them firmly to the metal sheet. However, if required, the reinforcing elements can be fastened during the coating e.g. mechanically or by means of gluing only to such a degree that they stay immobile while the surface layer is being fastened.<br>
Furthermore, if a surface element should be perforated for acoustic or other reasons, so that an acoustic sheet which attenuates sound can be placed behind it, the coating element can be easily perforated in a desired manner after gluing of the surface layer, or if the surface element is already provided with holes of a suitable shape, the surface layer can be removed from the holes afterwards.<br><br><br><br><br>
