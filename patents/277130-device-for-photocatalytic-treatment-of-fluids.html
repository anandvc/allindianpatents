				<td>Device for photocatalytic treatment of fluids<br>
The present invention relates to the field of devices for photocatalytic treatment of<br>
fluids, for instance for cleaning, deodorizing and sterilizing gases such as air.<br>
Nunnerous air purification systems have been described, or are commercially<br>
available, which aim to remove various pollutants, such as dust, micro-particles,<br>
noxious gases, allergens, and pathogenic micro-organisms from the air. In the<br>
known systems, dust and other micro-particles are generally removed from the air<br>
by the use of filters. It is known to remove certain volatile and reactive molecules<br>
by the use of catalytic processes. The use of ultraviolet light radiation to inactivate<br>
certain micro-organisms is also described. It is known to combine the use of<br>
ultraviolet light and photocatalytic processes to accelerate the degradation of<br>
noxious particles and the destruction of micro-organisms.<br>
The use of photocatalysts in devices for deodorising or purifying air is described in<br>
a number of patent applications, for example, US 5,670,126, US 6,558,639, US<br>
2002/094298, US 6,358,374, US 2004/007453, JP 11226357, WO 02/085989, and<br>
FR 2821558. The most common photocatalytic compound used in the known<br>
systems is titanium dioxide because of its excellent photocatalytic activity when<br>
irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, and its harmlessness to the human organism.<br>
The photocatalyst is generally combined with a binder to form a photocatytic<br>
coating material. A photocatalytic material which is convenient to use, adheres well<br>
to a number of surface and may be applied to articles which do not support high<br>
temperatures is described in WO 2006/010993, hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The photocatalytic material described in WO 2006/010993 comprises<br>
an inorganic binder including ultraviolet light permeable polymeric molecules,<br>
particularly acrylic molecules, a polar diluent, and particles of an inorganic semi-<br>
conductor, such as cadmium sulphide, zinc sulphide or titanium dioxide.<br>
In known systems the photocatalytic material is generally coated on a filter element<br>
or other surfaces of the air purifying system irradiated by an ultraviolet light source,<br>
typically an ultraviolet lamp. For example EP 0978690 and WO 96/37281 describe<br>
systems in which air is passed through an air-permeable sheet supporting a<br>
photocatalytic material and placed in the vicinity of an ultraviolet light source.<br>
Such systems generally provide only limited air cleaning properties with respect to<br>
removing certain airborne pollutants, allergens and pathogens.<br>
A system with improved air cleaning properties is described by WO 2007/060520,<br>
in which a photocatalytic material is coated on an inside surface of a tubular air<br>
conduit containing a UV lamp. A number of spaced apart blades are located on the<br>
inside surface of the air conduit in order to increase the surface area of<br>
photocatalytic material in the air conduit and to create turbulent flow of the air<br>
through the conduit.<br>
EP 0470518 describes a system designed for the decomposition of organic<br>
substances in which a liquid is passed through a stainless steel reaction vessel<br>
containing an ultraviolet immersion lamp. According to EP 0470518 baffles are<br>
located on the inner surface of the stainless steel tube to cause turbulence in the<br>
flow of the liquid on the reaction vessel inner surface.<br>
The known systems do however present a number of drawbacks. For instance the<br>
known systems are generally relatively complex and costly to manufacture and/or<br>
maintain. Moreover, the known systems either do not effectively treat all the air<br>
passing through the device, and/or cause excessive resistance on the air passing<br>
through with the consequence of increased noise and the need to employ more<br>
powerful fans for a given rate of airflow.<br>
There is also an ongoing need for air purification systems which reliably and<br>
effectively remove, destroy or inactivate airborne pollutants, allergens and<br>
pathogens.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a device for use in the photocatalytic<br>
treatment of fluids which provides reliable and effective treatment of said fluids and<br>
which is economic to manufacture.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide a reactor unit which provides reliable and<br>
effective cleaning, deodorizing and sterilizing of air and which is economic to<br>
manufacture.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an apparatus for the photocatalytic treatment<br>
of fluids that has a low pressure loss for a given rate of treated fluid flow.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an apparatus for the photocatalytic treatment<br>
of fluids that has low noise emission.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an apparatus for the photocatalytic treatment<br>
of fluids that is easy to use and versatile.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an apparatus for the photocatalytic treatment<br>
of fluids that is economic to manufacture, maintain and use.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an apparatus that can conveniently and<br>
effectively be used in the photocatalytic treatment of large volumes of fluids.<br>
Objects of the present invention are achieved by a reactor unit according to claim<br>
1.<br>
Disclosed herein is a reactor unit for photocatalytic treatment of fluids including a<br>
catalyser device comprising a catalytic material support having a generally tubular<br>
shape defining a fluid flow channel extending around and along a fluid flow path<br>
and a photocatalytic material coated on at least a portion of an internal surface of<br>
the support, and a radiation source received in a central portion of the catalyser<br>
device. The catalytic material support comprises a wall portion and a plurality of<br>
tapered protrusions extending from an internal surface of the wall portion to a tip<br>
proximate to the radiation source, the tapered protrusions being arranged around<br>
the radiation source and along the fluid flow channel.<br>
The term "proximate" as used in the present application is meant within a range of<br>
0 (i.e. touching) to a distance of less than 50% the distance separating the surface<br>
of the radiation source and the internal surface of the catalytic device wall portion.<br>
The tips of the tapered protrusions may be located at a position within a range of 0<br>
(i.e. touching the surface of the radiation source) to a distance of less than 50%,<br>
preferably less than 30%, the distance separating the surface of the radiation<br>
source and the internal surface of the catalytic device wall portion. For instance,<br>
the extremity of the tips of one or more tapered protrusions may be located at a<br>
distance within a range of 0 to 20mm from an external surface of the radiation<br>
source, preferably within a range of 0 to 10mm, more preferably within a range of 2<br>
to 5 mm.<br>
Advantageously the provision of a tubular catalytic material support with a plurality<br>
of tapered protrusions extending from a wall portion of the catalytic material support<br>
to a tip proximate to the radiation source not only provides a greatly increased<br>
surface area of photocatalytic material inside the reactor unit, but also increases<br>
the proportion of the coated internal surface of the catalyser device that is exposed<br>
to direct ultraviolet light from the radiation source.<br>
The plurality of tapered protrusions arranged around the inner periphery of the<br>
generally tubular support and along its length in the fluid general flow direction also<br>
provide a plurality of meandering paths for the fluid flow, thus increasing the<br>
amount of fluid which is brought into contact with the photocatalytic material.<br>
Further the arrangement of a plurality of tapered protrusions inside the reactor unit<br>
extending to a tip proximate to the radiation source creates a certain amount of<br>
turbulence to further increase the contact of air flowing through the reactor unit with<br>
photocatalytic material, whilst maintaining a low pressure loss (low resistance) on<br>
air flowing through system.<br>
Preferably the tapered protrusions extend substantially perpendicularly from the<br>
internal surface of the catalytic material support wall portion towards the radiation<br>
source.<br>
Advantageously having tapered protrusions around the internal surface of the<br>
reactor inside the reactor which extend substantially perpendicularly towards a<br>
central axis of the radiation source enables the surface area of the photocatalytic<br>
material on the catalytic material support that is exposed to direct ultraviolet<br>
radiation from the radiation source to be maximised.<br>
The plurality of tapered protrusions may preferably be arranged in successive rows<br>
around the internal surface of the catalytic material support, each offset at a certain<br>
angle with respect to the previous row. Such a stepped (angularly offset)<br>
arrangement of the tapered protrusions advantageously provides effective mixing<br>
of the air flowing through the reactor unit.<br>
Advantageously the tapered protrusions have an average height to largest base<br>
diameter ratio of 6:1 to 1:1, preferably 4:1 to 2:1. In this way the surface area of the<br>
photocatalytic material support and the distance between the radiation source and<br>
the photocatalytic material may be optimised for effective and reliable treatment.<br>
The base portion of the tapered protrusions may have any suitable cross-section<br>
shape, for instance circular, oval, hexagonal, octagonal, rhomboid or triangular. In<br>
order to maximise the surface area of photocatalytic material exposed to direct UV<br>
light radiation the tapered protrusions preferably have an external form with flat or<br>
rounded surfaces. Advantageously the tapered protrusions may have a conical<br>
form.<br>
Advantageously the form of the reactor unit according to the present invention<br>
permits a high air flow rate, e.g. of 20 to 100 m^lh, whilst maintaining a low<br>
pressure loss e.g. less than 300 Pa.<br>
According to a particular feature of the invention the catalytic material support is<br>
constructed from a single sheet of flexible material. The tapered protrusions are<br>
formed integrally from the sheet of flexible material and the sheet is folded to form<br>
a tubular shape.<br>
The catalytic material support may advantageously be formed from a sheet of<br>
flexible plastics material, e.g. polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, acrylonitrile butadiene<br>
styrene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephtalate, polymethyl methacrylate; but also<br>
a sheet of metal e.g. steel, aluminium or a sheet of mineral, vegetal or plastic<br>
fibers. The tapered portions can advantageously be easily and economically<br>
integrally formed from a sheet of flexible plastics material by moulding or<br>
thermofomning, for instance. Accordingly, no complex tool or procedure is required<br>
for the manufacture of the catalyser device.<br>
The photocatalytic material may advantageously be applied to the catalytic material<br>
support before the support is folded to form a tube. For instance the photocatalytic<br>
material may be painted or sprayed onto the surface of the catalytic material<br>
support sheet before folding of the support to form a tube. Advantageously the<br>
photocatalytic material may be sprayed onto the catalytic material support sheet by<br>
a mechanised spraying system substantially only to the area under illumination<br>
thus reducing waste. The spraying system could be an automated spray system,<br>
making the application of the photocatalytic material to the reactor unit very simple<br>
and economic.<br>
The photocatalytic material may be any known photocatalytic material.<br>
Advantageously the photocatalytic material may comprise an inorganic binder<br>
including ultraviolet light permeable polymeric molecules, a polar diluent, and<br>
particles of an inorganic semi-conductor, the weight of the inorganic semi-<br>
conductor particles being two to twenty times less than the weight of both the<br>
diluent and binder. The inorganic semi-conductor may be for instance cadmium<br>
sulphide, zinc sulphide and/or titanium dioxide. Preferably the photocatalytic<br>
material comprises titanium dioxide. The polymeric molecules may include acrylic<br>
molecules. Advantageously a photocatalytic gel as described in WO 2007/060520,<br>
incorporated herein by reference may be used.<br>
Further disclosed herein is a reactor unit for photocatalytic treatment of fluids, for<br>
instance for cleaning and deodorising air, comprising a catalyser device comprising<br>
a catalytic material support having a generally tubular shape forming an air conduit<br>
and a photocatalytic material coated on at least a portion of an internal surface of<br>
the support, a housing having a tubular body with a cavity for receiving the<br>
catalyser device, a radiation source received in a central portion of the catalyser<br>
device, an air inlet module, an air outlet module and a filter comprising one or more<br>
metal components having fluid purifying activity mounted in at least one of the fluid<br>
inlet and air outlet modules.<br>
The metal may be for instance a metal that has germicide activity, such as copper,<br>
silver or zinc or a reactive metal that has activity for converting noxious chemicals<br>
into compounds harmless to the human organism, e.g. which can act to convert<br>
carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, such as gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, or<br>
zirconium.<br>
Advantageously the filter may be in the form of a foam, e.g. formed from a plastics<br>
or metallic material, with the one or more metal components having air purifying<br>
activity coated thereon.<br>
The filter component may advantageously provide further enhanced fluid<br>
purification properties of the reactor unit, e.g. with respect to certain pathogens e.g.<br>
bacteria, and with respect to removing certain noxious compounds such as carbon<br>
monoxide.<br>
Further described herein is a reactor unit for photocatalytic treatment of fluids, for<br>
instance for cleaning and deodorising air, comprising a catalyser device comprising<br>
a catalytic material support having a generally tubular shape forming an air conduit<br>
and a photocatalytic material coated on at least a portion of an internal surface of<br>
the support, a radiation source received in a central portion of the catalyser device,<br>
a fluid inlet module and a fluid outlet module, wherein at least one of the fluid inlet<br>
module and air outlet module comprises a radiation baffle having multiple fluid-flow<br>
passages.<br>
The radiation baffle may advantageously comprise multiple concentric S-shaped<br>
vanes running from an axially interior surface to an exterior surface of the inlet<br>
and/or outlet modules.<br>
The radiation baffle acts to prevent ultraviolet light emitted by the radiation source<br>
from being visible outside of the fluid inlet module and fluid outlet module reactor.<br>
Advantageously the radiation baffle effectively minimises or eliminates the direct<br>
emission of the ultraviolet light emitted by the radiation source outside the reactor<br>
unit. Accordingly the reactor unit may be used in any environment without requiring<br>
an additional cover or outer housing, making the reactor unit easy and safe to use.<br>
Objects of this invention are also achieved by an apparatus for cleaning and<br>
deodorising air according to claim 22.<br>
There is provided an apparatus for photocatalytic treatment of fluids, for instance<br>
for cleaning and deodorising air, comprising a reactor unit as disclosed herein and<br>
a drive unit to which the reactor unit is removably connected. The drive unit<br>
comprises a power source for providing electrical power to the radiation source,<br>
and a fluid flow system for propelling or drawing fluid through the reactor unit.<br>
Advantageously the removable connection between the reactor unit and the drive<br>
unit is provided by complimentary quarter-turn electrical connectors on the drive<br>
unit and reactor unit.<br>
Accordingly the reactor units may be easily and conveniently attached and<br>
removed from the drive unit such that they may be easily and conveniently<br>
replaced during the life of the apparatus. The use of a quarter turn electrical<br>
connector on the reactor unit allows simple and easy connection of the reactor<br>
units into a fluid purification system.<br>
There is also disclosed an apparatus for cleaning and deodorising large volumes of<br>
gaseous fluid comprising a plurality of the reactor units grouped together in a single<br>
unit or housing.<br>
Advantageously the reactor unit and apparatus according to the present invention<br>
provides for effective and efficient photocatalytic treatment of fluids, for instance<br>
cleaning and deodorising of air.<br>
Advantageously, the fact that the all of the parts of the reactor unit may be simply<br>
and economically manufactured means that the reactor unit may be easily and<br>
economically replaced. The ability to easily and economically change the reactor<br>
unit enables apparatus to have a long operation lifetime, whilst at the same time<br>
ensuring continued effective cleaning and deodorizing properties in an economic<br>
manner.<br>
The compact and modular nature of reactor unit enables it to be easily integrated<br>
into a fluid treatment apparatus with a single reactor unit or with a plurality of<br>
reactor units, depending on the volume of fluid to be treated. The reactor units may<br>
advantageously for the purification treatment of air (cleaning, sterilising and<br>
deodorising) in various environments such as in households, offices, factories, and<br>
hospitals. The particularly compact arrangement and efficient and effective<br>
operation of the reactor unit, as well as its low weight, also enables it to be<br>
advantageously used in aircraft and automobiles for cleaning, sterilising and<br>
deodorising air.<br>
The reactor unit may also be used for the photocatalytic treatment of many other<br>
gases or mixture of gases for various applications in industry, for example<br>
purification of nitrogen or carbon dioxide for the food and beverage industry,<br>
deodorisation of effluents, treatment of ultra pure air in electronic or pharmaceutical<br>
clean rooms.<br>

Figures 8a to 8c are perspective views of apparatus for plnotocatalytic treatment of<br>
gaseous fluids according to further embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Referring to the figures, in particular figures 1 and 2, a reactor unit 1 for<br>
photocatalytic treatment of gaseous fluids according to the present invention<br>
includes a housing 2, a catalyser device 4 removably mounted in the housing, an<br>
ultraviolet radiation source received centrally in the catalyser device, a fluid inlet<br>
module 10 and a fluid outlet module 20. It is understood that the fluid inlet module<br>
and fluid outlet module may be reversed depending on the direction of the fluid-flow<br>
through the reactor unit.<br>
The catalyser device 4 comprises a catalytic material support 6, having a tubular<br>
shape defining a fluid flow channel extending around and along a fluid flow path. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the catalyser support material and the housing have a<br>
generally cylindrical shape. However, the catalytic support material and the<br>
housing may have any other generally tubular profile, such as elliptical or<br>
polygonal, depending on the arrangement of the ultraviolet radiation source and the<br>
projection of UV radiation therefrom. The tubular shape of the catalyser device<br>
preferably extends in an essentially linear general fluid flow direction F as shown in<br>
the embodiments illustrated, but could also extend in a generally curved or non<br>
linear manner (not shown).<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in figures 1 and 2 the fluid inlet module and fluid<br>
outlet module comprise the same functional units of a radiation baffle 12, a metallic<br>
filter 18 and a filter support 24. The fluid outlet 20 further includes a cover piece 26<br>
which can be used as print support.<br>
Referring particularly to Figures 1, 3a-3c, the catalytic support material 6 comprises<br>
a wall portion 7 and a plurality of tapered protrusions 8. The tapered protrusions<br>
have a base portion 5, on an internal surface 21 of the wall portion of the catalytic<br>
material support, and a tip 3 proximate to the radiation source 30.<br>
The radiation source is preferably positioned along the central axis of the catalyser<br>
device. The ultraviolet radiation source may conveniently be one or more UV<br>
lamps, for instance a low or medium pressure mercury lamp, an incandescent lamp<br>
or a fluorescent lamp. It may have a cylindrical shape, a bulb shape or any other<br>
shape. Conveniently the radiation source may be one or more single or multiple<br>
UV tube lamps. In the illustrated embodiment the radiation source is a double tube<br>
UV lamp, which has the advantage of proving a high level of UV irradiation for a<br>
relatively short length of radiation source, and usefully allows for a single point of<br>
electrical connection.<br>
Advantageously the ultraviolet radiation source generates light having a<br>
wavelength between 180 and 420nm, preferably between 240 and 390nm, e.g. 250<br>
to 260 nm. Preferably the ultraviolet radiation source generates light having a<br>
wavelength of 254 nm. The use of ultraviolet light having a wavelength of 254nm<br>
has been found to provide particularly effective germicide and photocatalytic<br>
activation properties. Use of light having a wavelength of 254nm advantageously<br>
allows the production of ozone to be avoided.<br>
The tips of the tapered protrusions may be located at a position within a range of 0<br>
(i.e. touching the surface of the radiation source) to a distance of less than 50%,<br>
preferably less than 30%, the distance separating the surface 31 of the radiation<br>
source 30 and the internal surface 21 of the catalytic device wall portion. The tips<br>
of the tapered protrusions extend from the internal surface of the catalytic material<br>
support 7 to a position near to or touching the radiation source 30. The tips of<br>
some or all of the tapered protrusions may abut an external surface of the radiation<br>
source. The extremity of the tips of one or more tapered protrusions may be<br>
located, for instance, at a distance of 0 to 20mm from an external surface of the<br>
radiation source, preferably 0 to 10mm, more preferably 2 to 5mm. The provision<br>
tapered protrusions that extend from an internal wall of the catalyser device to a<br>
position near to or touching the radiation source advantageously acts to provide a<br>
meandering non-laminar flow-path of the fluid flowing through the reactor unit,<br>
ensuring a thorough mixing of the fluid, and ensuring that all of the fluid flowing<br>
through the reactor unit is contacted with the photocatalytic material and exposed<br>
to UV radiation from the radiation source.<br>
Preferably the tapered protrusions extend substantially perpendicularly from the<br>
internal surface 21 of the wall portion towards the radiation source 30 positioned<br>
centrally in the catalyser device, in order to avoid or minimise any areas of the<br>
intemal surface of the catalytic material support that may be shaded from direct<br>
exposure to UV radiation from the radiation source. Advantageously the tapered<br>
protrusions extend substantially perpendicularly from the wall portion to a central<br>
axis of the radiation source. In this way the surface area of the catalytic material<br>
support exposed to direct ultraviolet radiation from the ultraviolet radiation source<br>
may be maximised. Where the radiation source is in the form of a plurality of UV<br>
radiation sources, e.g. a multi-tube ultraviolet lamp, the tapered protrusions<br>
positioned around the internal surface of the catalyser device may point towards a<br>
central axis where the radiation source is positioned.<br>
Figure 3b shows a possible arrangement of the tapered protrusions 8 around the<br>
circumference of the intemal surface of a catalyser device 4 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment illustrated the catalytic<br>
support material 6 is configured to receive a double-tube UV lamp along a central<br>
axis of the catalyser device. In Figure 3b the tips of the tapered protrusions 8 point<br>
towards the central axis of the catalyser device which constitutes also the central<br>
axis of the double-tube UV lamp radiation source when inserted in the catalyser<br>
device. It is also envisaged that the tips of the tapered protrusions may point<br>
towards the central axis of each of the UV tubes, i.e. as indicated by the numerals<br>
32 in Figure 3b.<br>
The tapered protrusions within one catalyser device may have different lengths, for<br>
instance dependant on the form of the radiation source received in the catalyser<br>
device.<br>
Preferably the distance between the radiation source and the irradiated surface of<br>
the internal wall portion of the catalytic support material is between 20mm to<br>
70mm, preferably between 30mm to 55mm to optimise the overall effectiveness of<br>
the photocatalytic activity on fluid passing therethrough.<br>
The plurality of tapered protrusions may be arranged in a regular arrangement<br>
around the internal surface of the catalyser device, for instance in a series of<br>
regularly spaced rows. Preferably the tapered protnjsions may be arranged in<br>
stepped rows around the internal surface of the catalytic material support, such that<br>
the tapered protrusions in each row around the circumference of catalyser device<br>
are not aligned with the tapered protrusions in the adjacent circumferential rows<br>
along the direction of fluid flow through the reactor unit. In other words, tapered<br>
protrusions at different positions along the fluid flow channel are arranged in an<br>
angularly offset manner around the internal surface of the catalytic material<br>
support. According to a preferred embodiment the tapered protrusions within a row<br>
are equally spaced apart and the rows are equally spaced along the length of the<br>
catalyser device. Preferably each row of tapered protrusions is displaced by a half<br>
step relative to the adjacent row, whereby a step corresponds to the distance<br>
between adjacent protrusions in a row. Such a stepped arrangement of the<br>
tapered protrusions advantageously provides effective mixing of the fluid flowing<br>
through the reactor unit.<br>
Preferably the tapered protrusions 8 have a conical form, which advantageously<br>
allows a relatively natural flow of the fluid through the reactor unit and accordingly<br>
minimising the charge loss. The base portion 5 of tapered protrusions preferably<br>
has a substantially circular shape for enabling easy manufacture of the tapered<br>
protrusions. Other shapes for the base portion of the tapered protrusions may be<br>
envisaged, such as, for instance circular, oval, hexagonal, octagonal, rhomboid or<br>
triangular.<br>
The tips of the tapered protrusion may have, for instance, a pointed, truncated or<br>
rounded form. The tips of the tapered protrusions preferably have a small cross-<br>
section area in order to minimise the surface area of the radiation source which is<br>
obstructed by the tips of the protrusions, thus ensuring that a maximum amount of<br>
the irradiation from the radiation source reaches the rest of the surface of the<br>
catalytic material support.<br>
The tapered protrusions may preferably have an average height h to average<br>
maximum base diameter d ratio of 6:1 to 1:1, preferably of 4:1 to 2:1. The height of<br>
a tapered protrusion is here measured form the radially innermost point of the tip to<br>
the radially outermost point of the base portion. The largest base diameter is here<br>
measured as the maximum distance measured across the cross section of the<br>
base portion of the protrusion.<br>
The tapered protrusions preferably have an internal taper angle a of 1 to 30°,<br>
preferably 1 to 15°, for example 5 to 15°. Accordingly, the balance between the<br>
number of protrusions within the catalyser device, providing a large surface area of<br>
photocatalytic material, and the provision of a sufficient direct irradiation of the<br>
surface of the catalyser support material by the UV radiation source may be<br>
optimised.<br>
As illustrated in figure 3c, it is possible to provide in addition certain other<br>
protrusions 19 extending from the internal surface 21 of the wall portion to a tip 23<br>
that is not proximate to the radiation source, such that the inner surface of the<br>
catalytic device comprises both long and short protrusions in view of increasing<br>
radiated catalyser surface area and to increase fluid flow contact with catalyser<br>
surface area near the base of the protrusions.<br>
At least a portion of the Internal surface of the catalytic material support is coated<br>
with a photocatalytic material. Preferably substantially the whole of the internal<br>
surface of the catalytic material support which is irradiated with ultraviolet light from<br>
the ultraviolet radiation source is coated with photocatalytic material.<br>
The photocatalytic material may be any known photocatalytic material. Preferably<br>
the photocatalytic material comprises particles of inorganic semi-conductor,<br>
particularly, cadmium sulphide, zinc sulphide and/or titanium dioxide in anatase<br>
crystalline form. Preferably the photocatalytic material comprises titanium dioxide<br>
in view of its effective catalytic activity in the presence of ultraviolet light, its<br>
stability, and its harmlessness to the human organism.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the present invention the photocatalytic material<br>
comprises an inorganic binder including ultraviolet light permeable polymeric<br>
molecules, a polar diluent, and particles of an inorganic semi-conductor, the weight<br>
of the inorganic semi-conductor particles being two to twenty times less than the<br>
weight of both the diluent and binder. The polymeric molecules preferably include<br>
acrylic molecules. Advantageously a photocatalytic gel as described in WO<br>
2007/060520 may be used. Such a photocatalytic gel material exhibits good<br>
adhesion to many types of materials, and advantageously can be dried in air with<br>
out the need for high temperature treatment, thus allowing the coating of materials<br>
that do not support high temperatures such as plastics.<br>
The photocatalytic material is applied onto an internal surface of the photocatalytic<br>
support material in order to use its photocatalytic properties to treat gases, such as<br>
clean and deodorize air. Advantageously the photocatalytic material may be in a<br>
liquid or gel form for easy application to the catalytic support material. The<br>
photocatalytic material may conveniently be applied to the catalytic material<br>
support for instance by spraying or painting of the gel or liquid on to a surface of<br>
the support, or by immerging the support into a receptacle containing the<br>
photocatalytic material.<br>
The catalytic material support may advantageously be formed from a plastics<br>
material, e.g. polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, acrylonitrile styrene, polyethylene,<br>
polyethylene terephtalate, polymethyl methacrylate.. The tapered protrusions and<br>
the wall portion of the catalytic material support may be manufactured separately,<br>
for example by injection moulding or extrusion moulding, and bonded, welded,<br>
glued or othenA/ise fixed together but preferably the tapered protrusions are formed<br>
integrally with the wall portion.<br>
Referring particularly to Figure 4a, according to a particular feature of the invention<br>
the catalytic material support 6 may be constructed from a single sheet of flexible<br>
material.<br>
The tapered portions can be easily and economically integrally formed from a sheet<br>
of flexible plastics material by thermoforming or moulding or by other standard<br>
methods. The flexible plastics material may be for example polystyrene, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, acrylonitrile styrene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephtalate or polymethyl<br>
methacrylate.<br>
The sheet of flexible material with the integrally formed tapered protrusions is then<br>
bent into a tubular shape and may be welded, crimped, bonded or held together by<br>
mechanical clamps along its seam to form a tube, or simply held in an outer<br>
support tube without being held together along its seam. The sheet may be<br>
provided with grooves or indents 9, as best seen in Fig. 4b, that ease the bending<br>
of the sheet into a tubular shape, and improve the reproducibility of the tubular<br>
shape.<br>
It is preferred to form the catalytic device from a single sheet, however within the<br>
scope of the invention, it is also possible to form the catalytic device from two or<br>
more sheets welded, bonded or fixed along their edges to each other by<br>
mechanical means (such as rivets or clamps). The two or more sheets could also<br>
be assembled without being bonded together, in a tubular housing of the reactor<br>
unit that positions and supports the sheets such that they collectively form a tube<br>
around the radiation source.<br>
The photocatalytic material may advantageously be applied to the catalytic material<br>
support before the support is folded to form a tube. For instance the photocatalytic<br>
material may be painted or sprayed onto the surface of the catalytic material<br>
support sheet before folding of the support to form a tube. Advantageously the<br>
photocatalytic material may be sprayed onto the catalytic material support sheet by<br>
a mechanised spraying system, e.g. an automated spray system, making the<br>
application of the photocatalytic material to the reactor unit very simple and<br>
economic.<br>
Where the catalytic support material is produced from a single sheet of flexible<br>
material the tapered protrusions should be spaced sufficiently far apart to allow<br>
bending of the sheet to form a tube. The spacing required will depend, amongst<br>
other things on the diameter of the catalyser device and the relative size of the<br>
protrusions.<br>
Where the tapered protrusions are formed integrally from the sheet of flexible<br>
material by a method such as thermoforming it is necessary that the base portion<br>
protrusions encompass a sufficient amount of the plastics material to enable the<br>
forming of the tapered protrusion. Preferably the protrusions have an average<br>
height h to average maximum base diameter d ratio 4:1 to 2:1.<br>
The catalytic support according to the invention can thus be made particularly<br>
lightweight, while providing very efficient treatment due to the high actively radiated<br>
surface and effective aerodynamics of the tapered protrusions. This<br>
advantageously enables the reactor units according to the invention to be used in<br>
mobile applications such as in aeroplanes or automobiles, or for use in mobile or<br>
even portable fluid treatment apparatus.<br>
The reactor unit may further comprise a radiation baffle in at least one of the fluid<br>
inlet module 10 and fluid outlet module 20, in order to prevent the ultraviolet<br>
radiation source from being visible outside the reactor unit.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the fluid inlet module 10 and fluid<br>
outlet module 20 include a radiation baffle 12 with multiple fluid-flow passages.<br>
Referring to Figures 6a and 6b, the radiation baffle may advantageously comprise<br>
multiple concentric S-shaped vanes 15.<br>
The radiation baffle may be provided as a single unit. Alternatively the radiation<br>
baffle may be manufactured as separate units which may then be mounted or<br>
connected together in the fluid inlet and/or fluid outlet module. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment the radiation baffle is comprised of two separate radiation baffle units<br>
13 and 14 which may be manufactured simply and economically e.g. from a<br>
plastics material by standard methods such as injection moulding.<br>
The radiation baffle may conveniently be manufactured from a plastics material<br>
such as polyethylene, polybutadiene terephtalate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene,<br>
polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, fibre-glass mineral or cellulosic type<br>
polymers.<br>
Advantageously the radiation baffle effectively minimises or eliminates the direct<br>
emission of the ultraviolet light emitted by the radiation source outside the reactor<br>
unit. Accordingly the reactor unit may be used in any environment without requiring<br>
an additional cover or outer housing, making the reactor unit easy and convenient<br>
to use.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment the radiation baffle 12 in the fluid inlet module 10 also<br>
acts as a filter to remove insects, large particles and dust. Alternatively, the reactor<br>
unit may include a separate filter at its inlet.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the fluid inlet module 10 and fluid<br>
outlet module 20 comprise a metallic filter 18 to provide further improved fluid<br>
purification.<br>
The filter comprises one or more metal components having fluid purifying activity.<br>
The metal may be a metal that has germicide activity, such as copper, silver or<br>
zinc, or a reactive metal that has activity for converting noxious chemicals into<br>
compounds harmless to the human organism, e.g. which can act to convert carbon<br>
monoxide to carbon dioxide, such as gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium or<br>
zirconium.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment the fluid purification active metal is provided on a<br>
separate filter component 18. It is also envisaged that the metal component may<br>
be provided on the surface of a component of the reactor unit, for instance as a<br>
coating, on the surface of the radiation baffle 12.<br>
The filter may also be formed from metal wire for instance as a gauze or fibre-glass<br>
type structure. According to a preferred embodiment the filter 18 may have an<br>
open-cell foam type structure, e.g. with at least 70%, preferably more than 80%<br>
space. Advantageously such a foam-type filter provides a large surface area of for<br>
filter for contact with the fluid flowing through the reactor unit whilst minimising<br>
charge loss. The filter may be formed from a plastics or metallic material, with the<br>
one or more metal components having fluid purifying activity coated on the surface<br>
thereof.<br>
The metallic filter component advantageously provides further enhanced the fluid<br>
purification properties of the reactor unit, e.g. with respect to certain pathogens<br>
such bacteria, and with respect to removing certain noxious compounds such as<br>
carbon monoxide.<br>
The reactor unit of the present invention may easily and conveniently be used in<br>
systems for air purification. Figures 8a to 8c show schematic illustrations of some<br>
possible air purification systems 50, 60 using the reactor unit of the present<br>
invention. The purification systems include a drive unit to which one or more<br>
reactor units according to the present invention are removably connected. The<br>
drive unit comprises an electrical connector for providing current to the radiation<br>
source electrical connector 31, and a fluid flow system for propelling or drawing air<br>
through the reactor unit. The drive unit may be configured for connection to the<br>
mains electrical network or may, for instance, be battery powered.<br>
For instance the drive unit may include a connection member 40 with socket<br>
connectors 42 into which the electrical pin connectors of the radiation source 31<br>
are received. Electrical connection may be effected by inserting the connection<br>
member 40 into the fluid inlet 10 or fluid outlet module of the reactor unit.<br>
Advantageously the removable connection between the reactor unit and the drive<br>
unit is provided by a quarter-turn electrical connection, whereby the connection<br>
member is inserted into tlie reactor unit and rotated to bring the electrical connector<br>
in the socket connectors 42 into electrical contact with the radiation source<br>
electrical pin connectors 31. The connection member or the reactor unit may<br>
comprise complimentary locking means 44 to limit the rotation of the connection<br>
member 40 with respect to the reactor unit and/or to hold the reactor unit and<br>
connection member together.<br>
The use of a quarter tum electrical connector on the reactor unit advantageously<br>
allows simple and easy connection of the reactor units into a fluid purification<br>
system.<br>
Figure 8c shows an apparatus 60, designed for the cleaning and deodorising of<br>
large volumes of air or other gases according to the present invention in which may<br>
a plurality of the reactor units 1 are grouped together in a single housing 62.<br>
The compact and modular nature of the reactor unit enables it to be easily<br>
integrated into a fluid treatment apparatus 50 having a housing 51 receiving a<br>
single reactor unit 1 or with a plurality of reactor units, depending on the volume of<br>
fluid to be treated. The apparatus housing may comprise an air inlet grill 54 and<br>
user interface screen or display 52 providing information on the usage of the<br>
apparatus and maintenance requirements, such as need for replacement of the<br>
reactor unit, radiation source and/or catalytic device.<br>
The reactor units may advantageously be used in an apparatus for the purification<br>
treatment of air (cleaning, sterilising and deodorising) in households, offices,<br>
factories, and hospitals. The particularly compact arrangement and efficient and<br>
effective operation of the reactor unit also enables it to be advantageously used in<br>
aircraft and automobiles for cleaning, sterilising and deodorising air. The reactor<br>
unit may also be used for the photocatalytic treatment of many other gases or<br>
mixture of gases for various applications. For instance, the reactor unit may be<br>
used for purifying gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide used in the food and<br>
beverages industry for food preservation, deodorising gaseous effluents or treat<br>
ultra-pure air in electronic or pharmaceutical clean rooms.<br>
