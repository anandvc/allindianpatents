DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It should be understood that the integrated circuit chips of the embodiments of the present invention arc advantageously formed on integrated circuit substrates called wafers and that multiple integrated circuits may be fabricated simultaneously on the same wafer and may be separated by a dicing process after fabrication is complete.<br>
FIGs. lA through IE are cross-sectional drawings illustrating fabrication of an integrated circuit chip according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. lA, a wafer lOOA is fabricated through pad level. Wafer lOOA includes a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate 105 which includes a silicon substrate 110, a buried oxide layer (BOX) 115 formed on the silicon substrate and a single-crystal silicon layer 120 formed on the BOX, Formed in silicon layer 120 is trench isolation 125 and source/drains 135 and channel regions 140 of field effect transistors (FETs) 130. Also formed in silicon layer 120 are optional silicon regions 150. Formed over channel regions 140 are a gate dielectric (not shown) and, in one example, polysilicon gates 145 of FETs 130 as well as a dummy gate 146. In one example, silicon regions 150 are highly doped N or P-lype (between about 1E19 atm/cm' and about 1E21 atm/cm^) in order to reduce the resistance of the contact to less than about 0.5 micro-ohms. An electrically conductive metal silicide layer 152 is formed on exposed silicon surfaces of source/drains 135, gates 145 and diffusion contacts 150 prior to formation of: pre-metal dielectric (PMD) layer 155 to flirther reduce the "contact" resistance of a metal structures to silicon structures as described infra. Metal silicides are formed by deposition of a metal layer on a silicon surface, heating the silicon surface high enough to cause the metal layer to react with the silicon, and then dissolving away any unreacted metal. Examples of metal silicides include, but are not limited to, platinum, titanium cobalt and nickel silicides.<br>
Formed on top of silicon layer 120 is PMD layer 155. ForaiedinPMD layer 155 arc contacts 160A and 160B. Contacts 160A and 160B arc electrically conductive. Contacts 160A electrically contact silicide layer 152 on source/drains 135 and on silicon contact 150, Some of comacts 160A are dummy contacts extending to trench isolation 125. Contacts 160B contact silicide layer 152 on gates 145 and dummy gates 146, PMD layer 155 and contacts 160Aand 1603 may be considered a wiring level.<br><br>
Contacts 160A and 160B may be fabricated independently in separate operations or simultaneously. When fabricated simultaneously, first and second type contacts may be formed by etching the respective trenches in situ using a single mask or fabricated using various combinations of photolithographic and hard masks and etches to define the trenches separately, follovv-ed by a single metal (ill and a chemical mechanical polish (CMP) operation.<br>
Formed on PMD layer 155 is a first inter-level dielectric layer (ILD) 165 including electrically conductive dual-damascene wires 170 in electrical contact with contacts 160-Formcd on ILD 165 is a second ILD 175 including electrically conductive dual-damascene wires 180 in electrical contacl with wires !70, Formed on ILD 175 is a third ILD 190 including electrically conductive dual-damascene I/O pads 190 in electrical contact with wires 180. Altematively, wires 170, 180 and pads 190 may be single damascene wires or pads in combination with single damascene vias.<br>
A damascene process is one in which wire trenches or via openings are formed in a dielectric layer, an electrical conductor of sufficient thickness to fill the trenches is deposited on a top surface of the dielectric, and a CMP process is performed to remove excess conductor and make the surface of the conductor co-planar with the surface of the dielectric layer to form damascene wires (or damascene vias).  When only a trench and a wire (or a via opening and a via) is formed the process is called single-damascene.<br>
A duaJ-daraascene process is one in which via openings are formed through the entire thickness of a dielectric layer followed by formation of trenches part of the way through the dielectric layer in any given cross-sectional view. All via openings are intersected by integral wire trenches above and by a wire trench below, but not all trenches need intersect a via opening. An electrical conductor of sufficient thickness to fill the trenches and via opening is deposited on a top surface of the dielectric and a CMP process is performed to make the surface of the conductor in the trench co-planar with the surface the dielectric layer to form dual-damascene wires and dual-damascene wires having integral dual-damascene vias.<br><br>
The etches used in single-damascene and dual damascene processes to form trenches may advantageously be reactive ion etches (RlEs).<br>
In one example, PMD layer 155 comprises boro-phosphorus siHcate glass (BPSG) or phosphorus -silicate glass (BSG). In one example, contacts 160A and 160B comprise a titanium/titanium nitride liner and a tungsten core. In one example, ILD 165, 175 and 185 comprise silicon dioxide or a layer of silicon dioxide over a layer of silicon nitride, in one example, wires 170 and 180 and 1/0 pads 190 comprise atantalum;'tantalum nitride liner and a copper core.<br>
In one example, ILD layers 165, 175 and 185 independently comprise silicon dioxide (SiOj), silicon nitride (SijNj), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon oxy nitride (SiON), silicon oxy carbide (SiOC), organosilicale glass (SiCOH), plasma-enhanced silicon nitride (PSiN,) orNBLok fSiC(N,H)).<br>
In one example, ILD layers 165. 175 and 185 independently comprise a low K (dielectric constant) material, examples of which include but arc not limited to hydrogen silsesquioxane polymer (HSQ), methyl silsesquioxane polymer (MSQ), SiLK TM (polyphenylene oligomer) manufactured by Dow Chemical, Midland, TX, Black Diamond TM (methyl doped silica or SiOx(CH3)y or SiCxOyHy or SiOCH ) manufactured by Applied Materials, Santa Clara, CA, organosilicate glass (SiCOH), and porous SiCOH. In one example, a low K dielectric material has a relative permittivity of about 2.4 or less.<br>
In FIG. IB, a passivation layer 195 is formed on third ILD 185 and I/O pads 190 and a handle wafer 200 attached to passivation layer 195 using an adhesive (not shown) or by other methods known in the art.<br>
In FIG. lC,bulk substrate 110 (see FIG. IB) is removed to expose BOX !15. In one example, bulk substrate 110 is removed by a grinding operation to substantially thin of the bulk substrate operation followed by (1) a chemical etch in a strong base such as aqueous potassium hydroxide or (2) a chemical etch in a mixture of hydrofluoric, nitric and acetic<br><br>
acids or (3) any chemical etch which is selective to etch silicon over silicon dioxide to remove the remaining bulk substrate.<br>
In FIG. ID, electrically conductive first backside contacts 205 are formed through BOX 115 and silicon layer 120 Contacts 205 extend from the lop surface of BOX 115 to silicide layer 152 on source/drains 135 and silicon conl.acl 150. In one example, contacts 205 are formed by a single damascene process. Tn one example, contacts 205 comprise a titanium/titanium nitride liner and a tungsten core.<br>
Elcctricaliy conductive second backside contacts 210 arc fomied through BOX 115 and trench isolation !25. Contacts 210 extend from the top surface of BOX 115 to silicidc layer 152 on dummy gate 146 and to selected contacts I60A. In the case of dummy gate 146, contact 210 extends through the gate dielectric layer (not shown) as well.<br>
Contacts 205 and 210 may be fabricated independently in separate operations or simultaneously. When fabricated simultaneously, first and second type contacts may be formed by etching the respective trenches in situ using a single mask or fabricated using various combinations of photolithographic and hard masks and etches to define the trenches separately, followed by a single metal fill and CMP operation.<br>
In FIG, IE, foniied on BOX 115 is first inter-level dielectric layer (ILD) 165A including electrically conductive dual-damascene wires 170A in electrical contact with contacts I60A. Fomied on ILD 165A is second JLD 180A including electrically conductive dual-damascene wires 180A in electrical contact with wires 170A. Fonned on ILD I75A is third ILD )90A including electrically conductive dual-damascene I/O pads 190A in.electrical contact with wires 180A, Alternatively, wires 170A, 180A and pads I90A of may be single damascene wires in combination with single damascene vias. A passivation layer 195A is fonned on third ILD 185A and I/O pads 190A and handle wafer 200 is removed. This completes fabrication of wafer lOOA which know can be externally wired (via pads 190 and 190A) on two opposite sides.<br><br>
FIGs- 2A and 2B are cross-sectional drawings illustrating fabrication of "an integrated circuit chip according to a second embodiment oi' the preseni invention. The second embodiment of the present invention differs from the first embodiment of the present invention by contact 210 of FIGs. 1D and 1E being replaced by contacts 205 in a wafer 100B. Processing as illustrated in FIGs. 1A through 1C and described supra in are performed and then FIG, 2A replaces FIG. ID and FIG. 2B replaces FIG, IE.<br>
In FIGs 2A and 2B a contact 205 is in electrical and physical contact with the polysilieon of dummy gate 146, In one example, dummy gate 146 is advantageously highly doped N or P-typc (between about 1E19 atm/cm^ and about 1E2! atm/cm2) in order to reduce the resistance of the contact to less than about 0,5 micro-ohms. Thus all backside contacts are etched to the same depth,<br>
FIGs, 3A and 3B are cross-sectional drawings illustrating fabrication of an integrated circuit chip according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The third embodiment of the present invention differs from the first embodiment of the present invention by utilization of silicide to sihcide contacts in a wafer lOOC. Processing as illustrated in FIGs. lA through IC and described supra in are performed and then FIG. 3A replaces FIG. ID and FIG, 3B replaces FIG. IE.<br>
In FJGs. 3A and 3B, an electrically conductive metal silicide layer 153 is formed from the backside of wafer lOOC in selected source/drains 135 by forming contact openings in BOX layer 115, depositing a metal layer, annealing to form a metal sihcide and removing the excess metal. Then contact metal (i.e. titanium/titanium nitride liner and a tungsten core) is used to fill the contact openings. Sihcide layer 153 is in physical and electrical contact with silicide layer 152 on selected source/drains 135 and a contact 215 is in physical and electrical contact with silicide layer 153. Also an electrically conductive metal silicide layer 154 is formed in the polysilieon of dummy gate 146 after a contact openings is formed through BOX layer 115, PMD layer 125 and the gate dielectric layer (not shown) and a contact 205 is in physical and electrical contact with silicide layer 154.

F!Gs. 4A through 4E are cross-sectional drawings itluslraling fabrication of an integrated circuit chip according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The third embodiment of the present invention differs from the first embodiment of the present invention with fully-silicidcd source/drains, gates and silicon contacts replacing the silicide layer of the first embodiment.<br>
FIG,4A is the same as FIG, 1A except a wafer lOOB differs from wafer 100D(seeFlG. lA) in that source drains 135 (sec FIG, 1 A) arc replaced with fully silicidcd source/drains 136, gates 145 (sec FIG. lA) are replaced with fiiUy silicidcd gates 148, dummy gales 146 (sec FIG. lA) are replaced with fully silicidcd dunmiy gates 149 and silicon contact 150 (see FIG. lA) is replaced with fully siUcided contact 156, A fully silicidcd source drain is one in which the silicide layer extends from a top surface of the source drain to BOX J15. Note , that the silicide does not extend the fully silicided gates. A fully silicided gate is one in which the sihcide layer extends from a top surface of the gate to the gate dielectric layer. A fully silicided silicon contact is one in which the silicide layer extends from a top surface of The silicon contact to BOX 115,<br>
Fully siUcided source/drains, gates and silicon contacts are foiined by deposition of a thick metai layer on a silicon surface, heating the silicon surface high enough to cause (he metal layer to react with the silicon, and then dissolving away any unreacted metal. The thickness of the metal layer is great enough (o supply sufficient metal, by thermal diffusion through the silicon, to react with silicon atoms throughout the source/drain, gate or silicon contact. Again, examples of metal silicides include, but are not limited to, platinum, titanium cobalt and nickel silicides,<br>
FIGs. 43 and 4C are essentially the same as FIGs. IB and IC respectively except for the differences described supra.<br>
FIG, 4D is the same as FIG. ID except for the differences described supra and the replacement of contacts 205 and 210 of FIG. ID by respective contacts 215 and 220 of FIG. 4D. In FIG. 4D, electrically conductive backside contacts 215 are formed through BOX 115- Contacts 215 extend from the top surface of BOX 115 to the bottoms of fully silicided<br><br>
source/drains 136 and silicon contact 156. In one example, contacts 215 are Ibimed by a single damascene process. In one example, contacts 215 comprise a titanium' titanium nitride liner and a tungsten core.<br>
Eleclricalty conductive second backside contacts 220 are formed through BOX 115 and trench isolation 125. Contacts 220 extend from the top surface of BOX 115 to the bottom surface of fully silicided dummy gate i46 and to selected contacts 160A. In the case of dummy gate 146, contact 220 extends through the gate dielectric layer (not shown) as well. Thus, contacts 215 and 220 do not have to etched as deeply or through silicon as contacts 205 and 210 of FIG. ID.<br>
First and second contacts 215 and 220 may be fabricated independently in separate operations or simultaneously. When fabricated simultaneously, first and second type contacts may be formed by etching the respective trenches in situ using a single mask or fabricated using various combinations of photolithographic and hard masks and etches to define the trenches separately, followed by a single metal fill and CMP operation.<br>
FIG. 4E is essentially the same as FIG. IE except for the differences described supra.<br>
While each of wafers lOOA, lOOB, 1 IOC and ! lOD has been illustrated wtih a single contact level, two wiring levels and a pad level, more or less contact and wiring levels may be fabricated and wafers lOOA and 1108 maybe fabricated with different numbers of contact and/or wiring levels, Also, handle wafer 200A may be detached from wafers lOOA, lOOB, 1 IOC and 1 lOD before or after dicing of wafers lOOA, lOOB, 1 IOC and HOD into individual integrated circuits.<br>
Thus, the embodiments of the present invention provide for greater wiring density and increased contact pad count for comiection of integrated circuit chips to the next level of packaging.<br><br><br>
