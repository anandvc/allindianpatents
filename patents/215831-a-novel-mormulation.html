The present invention relates to a non-ir*f«ctioue nucleic acici (RJiA and DMA) construct constructed to express a rtcombinant antibody or Antibody fragment in a host cell. The antibody molecule confers protection to the host against a petncgen, allergen or toxin, Th* host may be any animal including a human.<br>
immunization by injection of homo lego us or htterolcgous aerusn-artibociies is routinely ^sed in humans for inaaunaprophylaitis of people traveling to foreign rations ' involving risk of exposur* to exotic pathogens. In arxiaals a siriLlar atr-ategy may ae employed for protection of valuable apeciaseris , but. is centrally coc expansive for routine veterinary use. Pis*iva itnmuniaeticr. of aniroaia agaiiis: infectious diseases is thus mostly done en an experiment*! basis with the aim of studying the function of structures such as antibodies in vivo and relating the results to in vi~ro experiments.<br>
During the recent decade, diverse technologies for th* in vitro production o£ antioodie* ay the use of jrecambinant DWA technology has beer, developed. Tha smallest functional recombir.ant antibody containing the actions of the heavy (K] and light U) polypeptide chains as in the native Bialecule hivs proved to be the single chain variafcli~f raiment construct (single chain fV} . The single chain FV conatruct ia cawpoaed of the variable parts of the H and'L chains connected by « flexible spaces region. Such avolecules have been ueed in varioua studies including 'virus neutralisation, cancer™ jLnsnuno therapy and recently also in the fcnr. of DMA vaccines where plasmios encoding anfci-idiotype single ..jgpbain rv<br><br>
to induce an "antigen-specific<br>
immune response. However, direct establishment of protective iWBunity to infectious diseases by prophylactic treatment with plasmid DKA carrying single chain FV genes encoding protective antibodies ha* not been described.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide 4 non-infectious nucleic acid construct which can product an antibody stoiecule in v*v$ thereby conferring iamtuaity to a<br>
A further object o£ the present invention is to provide a method of establishing iramur.x^y tgfcinst &amp; aachoger..<br>
A yec further object of the pr«s«nc invention ia to provide a method of therapy for Animals which have 6 deficient iawune system.<br>
An additional ofajacc of the preserve invention is to provide a method of cherapy for an anijnti suffering from ftn allargxc reaction or a mechod of prevent ing an allergic reaction.<br>
For avoidance of doubt it should be noced that the word "animal" includes but is not restricted to usaitraais including humans .<br>
According to an embodiment o£ cha present invention there ia provided a nucleic acid construct encoding a r»eemfeinanu antibody malaeule* isid construct being adapted for the ir&gt; vivo escabliahnent of a protective immunity to an infectious disease in an animal.<br><br>
According to &amp; further embooimanc of the present invention there is pcovifiec a nucleic acici construct encoding a recombinant antibody molecule, said construct i* fcrsauleted for the in vivo prevention cf an allergic reaction to an in an animal.<br>
According tc a yet further embodiment of the present invention there is provided &amp; nucleic acid construct encoding a recojRbinant sntioody molecule, wherein laid construct is formulated for the in vivo prevention of a reaction caused by the presence of a toxic substance in an animal,<br>
Che term reco-nabinant antibody molecule encompasses &amp; full siz* mtibody, a single chair, variable fragment or any part of t&amp;r mtibody which can recognia* an an;iger,. In this connection, :cnveni.«ntLy the intibody fragmen; aces not mve to be single ;hair. . However, i* some embodiments it La single chaif. ,<br>
j* ties now b««n tour.ci tr.&amp;t the intramuscular ^nrection of s nucleic field ccnsttuct, in the fora of a plasaid, encoding .a virus-r.eutcaLiair.'j single chain antibccy fragment cen neciate in vivo expression, of antibodies which protect an animal against a ooasibly lethal exposure to A virus. Thi» has been established tn an experimental model which involves a fish rhabdcvirus caliec viral h&amp;emorrha<jic septicaemia virus in the reinfcow treat myttiasi as a host apeeiea.></jic>
According to a farther embodiment of the present Invention •.here is proviaeo « nucleic; acio construct, sue:, as a pltcniet*. lonwriai -".q an excreasioc, ve^tsi ana * gene sequar.ce for heavy ind/or light chair, variable domains nf an ar.tisooy.<br><br>
Preferably tr.« heavy and light chain variable domains are linked by * iinkee sequence in order that they form whet is known in the art as a single chain variable-fragment.<br>
It is thought that the antibody fragment as expressed in and secreted from a hcst cell carrying the vector wtil act with the same specificity as a natural antibody would in th* presence of a substance which it recognises. in this connection, for example, if the heavy and/or light chain variable domain were derived from a monoclonal anti-body raised against dengue virus then if dengue virus injected a host who hac received a nucleic construct expressing a single chain variable fragment produced Scon rh» heavy and light chain of the awnoclcm*! antibody, the fragment would recognise cells infacred with the dengue virus or the dengue virus particle itself and bind thereto thereby neutralising or inhibiting th* virus and/wr giving the host time to mour.t an ijsutiune response against zh» virus,<br>
In pr»;«rreo eiraodi.Tsar.ts the expresaicr. vector is made for eujearyocic expression *rid/or is nor, infectious, for example, a bacterial plssniid, cr a smaller DMA fragment carrying t:ae variable fragment er.cibody gene within a eukacyotit fexpreasior. opetcn racludir.g regulatory elefter.ts such as an enhance::, promoter ana pclyadeny-ation signal caulct be uaeci, Alcernatively, stabilised messenger RNA including a positive atrand transcript of the variable-fragment antibody gene with translation signers may be employed.<br>
The antibody -ragtnent genea can'be donee by any method known to these sXilied in the art., fo-c example from hvoridoma cell-s or directly from 3*lymphocytes from iHumurjiiai incividuaLs.. isic acid constructs «r.cocinq protective antieoey fragment-*<br><br>
can oe prepared against any important pathogen7disease causing agent in animals including pathogens against which vaccines art not available or hiva proved insufficient. Furthermore, as a result of veterinary regulations, USB of live vaccines m*y not be allowed, In such cases an alcernacive prophylactic measure would have co be taker.. Such a aeaaure could be the administration of the nucleic acid construct of the present invention- A list of possible pathogens is given below,- this list is not intended to be exhaustive.<br>

In case of humans with either * congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, vaccines will generally be insufficient. in such casas, administration of a number of nucleic acid constructs according to Che present invention encoding antibodies against a broad spectrum of pathogens may b« considered.<br>
For the purpose of prevention at allergic relations induced by luE response, administration cf nucleic acid constructs mediating expression of in allergen-specific recorcfainar.c snribody may be used to competitively inhibit binding of she allergen to the IgE molecules in the host. Alternatively ger* constructs encoding ar.ti-i?; antibodies may be used to -.nterfere with tne interaction. between Ij£ anc mast cells ir. che aliecgic individual.<br>
ifls straticr. o£ Antibody ger-.e cor;scruc-wS encoding antiiseclies ta Eoxins or ver.o«s can be used fcr the prophylactic treatment cf individuals periodically being in high risk cf exposure co toxic organisms. Tha venoms could, for example, oe froft sr.&amp;ices or spiders.<br>
Conveniently the construct further comprises a gene encoding a signal sequence for the secretion of the product encoded bv the aer.e saquer.c*. Tn* sigr.jl sequence will allow the product ot tha gene sequence to be secreted trom a cell in which the gene has been expressed, int- ch'e blood so that the product of the gene sequence can circulate therein. For example, the genes fcr the signal sequence of either rainbow trout trans 'ermine, growch factor beta tTGr-be&gt;ca;r or murine Ig<br><br>
kappa-chain can be added to the :' end of a gene to be<br>
administered tc the fish. Other secrttion signals/ preferably of homologous origin to the host species may te employed. Examples of gents which encode proteins which act as secretion signals include the ger.e for immunoglobulir. heavy and light chain, secretion signals or other glycoproteir. secretion signals&gt; Preferably, the secretion signal should include a proteolytic cleavage site ensuring removal of the signal peptidt before secretion of the antibody fragment.<br>
Preferably the construct further comprises a known gene sequence which encodes 8 short peptide sequence that can be usad to identify transferees cells. Such a gene sequence can b* attached to the 3' end of -he gene. Examples of such a sequence -include a human icapca light cftair; construe1: or sequence ftnccaing a six r.U';id.rie residue. In both cases, an a.-itioody specifically recogr.iaing the expressed peptide is commercially available.<br>
The construct according ~.c ^he present invention may ba da'.iverad cy any suitaeia aiathed, such as ay i.-.:action la,g intramuscularly!, oy a spray on a nucosa surface ,'e.g incranasaliy! , by particle bcrrJaarcimenc on stcin/c.erai$ through use of 3 gane gut:, oy *i«ctroporation or by uptake by *n animal from an aqueous environment. In this connection, tne plasmid may be encased in a liposome for administraticn to an animal. The construct may be administered to the animal topically, through inhalation or orally. For oral administration the construct should be protected from degradation by proper encapsulation.<br>
It is preferred ihat in * composition or formulation Jot adjnir.is~racion c-f the tor.st:u£Ls triere ars present genes<br><br>
encoding the heavy and/or light chair, variable fragments against several different epitope* or an variable fragment antibody gens expression library against a given, pathogen. In this connection, the various fragments may be provided on one plasmid or they may b* provided on several different gene constcucts which are all present in the same formulation or other method of administration. in the alternative! each plasmid may have to be administered separately.<br>
The invention alao provides for a method for treating an animal, for' example a mammal or a fish which comprises administering thereto a plasmid or ether nucleic acri construct encoding a prctective antibody fragment as previously described.<br>
The invention thus provides far a method a? therapy for an animal which has a deficient i:wr.u.ie system.<br>
7 he invention also provides far a therapeutic compos it 10?. comprising the piasmici as previously described ar.d a. pnarmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor. The composition may oe formula ceo such chat it is in the form of:, for example, a vaccine, dosage form, sreaa, ointment, liquid oc pa inc.<br>

All 10 individuals injected with pCCNA3-B'JI neutralised VHSV, whsreas no neutralising activity was detected in plasma from fish injected with che pCONA2 (Table 3). When plasma from fish injected with pCDNW-BCJ1 was _ preincjbated with Rabbit ar.ti-humar- kappa before sesrirtj in 50% PNT, the neutralising activity was eliminated, whereas r.s effect was observed upon pre-incubatian with norma; rabbit serum or wish rabbit serurr. to trout.

T*ble 5, Protection against VHSV<br><br>
(Table Remove) To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating establishment cf protective ironur.ity ^o ar. infectious paihogen in higher vertebrates by adsinistration of ger.ea encciins pat.-.oqen specif^s single ch»ir. FV antibodies. The protective activity of the ?CDNA-3UI construct fully correlated wich the sccurranc* of neutralising anti-VHSV ScAbs in the plasma of1 injected fish, and a_though involvement o; non-specific necl**niajn$ cannot be completely exciudea, it appears likely :h»- the produced B'Jl scAb has been the ^1*3or cause of srotection fcllowiftg injection of the pCONA2-B01 piaimid DNA. Accordingly, in a later experiment: including cheliengt of the Jiah with a virus iaolate not recognised by the reoombinant: antibody fragnenL encoded by pCDNA-BDl, no protect lor. was obtained.<br>
In contraat co DNA-vaccine*, iriciud.ing anti--diocype vaccines, the admir.istra~l3n of pi»smic,borne genes in u.iis instance dc<br>
not involve specific activation of the immune system in the individual. The principle is simply thit iingle chain FV antibody polypeptides produced by the cells that take up th« administered piaswid will be systemically distributed by <:he body fluids and protect the individual if infection with tha pathogen occurs. this corresponds to mechanism of prophylaxis against infectious diseases in humans through administration antiserum or iflmunoglobulin from immunised donors ani-tials but without side effects such as risk roncoir.it4.it transfer induction lypersens-tivicy fallowing repeated administrations. arcler :o avoid variability overcoming immunity established by plasmid practical use may involve piasmids encoding genes single chain variable fragments several different epitopes fv antibody gene-expression library towards a giver painoge-i.></:he>
The principle of genetic imunoprcphylaxis according to the invention can be extended to mammals and to humans if. particular as it i« a valuable tori for transient protection of individuals such ss travelers agd.nsc exposure to pathogens or taxir.s where nc afficienc vaccines are available. Similarly, the invention may be used far induction of tile synthesis of antibodies of a desired specificity for use in imtnunodeficient individuals. Also the nucleic acid construct of the present invention could be used in individuals that produce an allergic response to certain allergens, such as pollen. In this connection, production or induction o£ antibody fragments to those 'allergens may be used for prevention of an allergic reactior.<br><br>
