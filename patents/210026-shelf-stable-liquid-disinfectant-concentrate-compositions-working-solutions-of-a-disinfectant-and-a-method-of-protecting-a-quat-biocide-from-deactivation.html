				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a biocidal system utilising a quaternary biocide and to a<br>
method of disinfection utilising the system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Quaternary ammonium compounds are a well-known class of biocides. Of these monomeric quaternary ammonium compounds are more powerful antimicrobials and less costly than more recently developed polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds. Although not all quaternary ammonium compounds have biocidal properties or have them to the same extent as each other, the correlation between biocidal properties and chemical structure has been the subject of extensive investigation reported in the literature. Those skilled in the art have no difficulty in distinguishing between those which are useful as biocides and those which are not useful for biocidal purposes. The abbreviation "quat biocide " is herein used to refer to biocidally active quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
Quat biocides such as, for example benzalkonium chlorides, have the major advantage that they are broad spectrum, low cost biocides useful for general disinfection. One of the main disadvantages exhibited by quat biocides is that they are instantly deactivated in the presence of proteins and certain ions such as those found in hard water. While the precise mechanism for this deactivation is not well understood, theories relating generally to complexing/binding of the cationic site of the quat biocide with anionic sites of the protein are widely accepted as being a cause of the deactivation. While polymeric quaternary compounds are known which do not suffer from these disadvantages to the same degree, they are significantly less effective and more costly in comparison with the monomeric quaternary biocides. Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide a system which would enhance the efficacy of quat biocides, and especially of simple monomeric quat biocides, in the presence of protein and other deactivators.<br>
Because quat biocides are so readily deactivated by protein they are generally unsuitable for use as disinfectants intended to be applied to surfaces which may<br>
2<br><br>
have become contaminated with proteinaceous material - for example food preparation surfaces, food preparation machinery, kitchen walls, partitions and floors or the like, or working and other surfaces in hospitals, in dental or medical practices, or for disinfecting medical instruments, paraphernalia, or equipment. Moreover quat biocides cannot be used biocidally in combination with enzymes (which are proteins) since they are deactivated by the protein and also because they immediately deactivate the enzyme.<br>
A convenient measure of biocidal efficacy of a biocide is its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ("MIC"). MIC is a measure of the minimum concentration of the biocide, which succeeds in preventing bacterial growth in a culture during a specified time period, for example 24 hrs.<br>
Another measure of biocidal efficacy is to count the kill rate for standard cultures treated with a predetermined concentration of biocide after a predetermined time. In Australia, biocides are graded according to tests of the latter kind specified by the Therapeutic Goods Authority (TGA) as Grade B "Hospital Dirty", Grade A "Hospital Clean", Grade C "household/commercial". A copy of "The TGA Disinfectant Test" is annexed. The Therapeutic Goods Authority (TGA) tests are specified as TGO 54. Similar tests and classifications are applicable in other countries. Details of the MIC test are shown in "Bailey &amp; Scott 'Diagnostic Microbiology', 8th edition, 1990 at page 177. MIC tests referred to herein are conducted over 24 hrs.<br>
A quat biocide dissolved in water at a concentration which is sufficiently effective to be classified by the Therapeutic Goods Authority (TGA) as, for example, a Grade A disinfectant ("hospital grade, clean") would be at least 10 times less effective in the presence of as little as 1% of a protein Put another way, approximately a ten fold increase in concentration of the active biocide would be required to achieve complete kill of bacteria in the presence of say 1% of a protein as could have been achieved by that biocide in the absence of the protein.<br>
Straight chain and polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds have been proposed for use in laundry detergents not for their antimicrobial properties but for their static control properties; fabric softening benefit or as a cationic surfactant.     Quaternary  ammonium   compounds   used   as  softeners  or  as<br>
3<br><br>
surfactants are either inherently not effective biocides, or their biocidal activity is deactivated by ions in the formulation or in the water, and in use in laundry detergents are substantially devoid of any biocidal effectiveness.<br>
Liquid dishwashing compositions have employed quaternary ammonium compounds as cationic detergents in combination with non-ionic detergents to assist with oil/grease removal. Some contain small concentrations (e.g. 0.001%) of a quaternary ammonium salt to help to prevent any bacterial growths from developing in the detergent composition during lengthy storage in opened containers.<br>
Disinfection of surfaces contaminated with proteins currently requires at least a 2-step procedure:<br>
Step 1. Physico-mechanical removal of proteinous soil Step 2. Disinfection of pre-cleaned surfaces Often this should be followed by a third step:<br>
Step 3. Rinsing off residual disinfectants. A major advantage of monomeric quat biocides is that some of them do not require to be rinsed even from food-contacting surfaces when applied at low levels.<br>
There remains a need for effective and economical surface disinfection in the presence of protein. It would be especially desirable to provide a single step procedure and composition for enzyme-enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protein soiled surfaces.<br>
Any discussion of the prior art herein is not to be construed as indicative of the state of the common general knowledge in the field.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.<br>
It is an object of at least some of the preferred embodiments of the invention to provide a quat biocide composition which remains effective for 24 hrs notwithstanding the presence of protein.<br>
4<br><br>
It is a further object of at least some of these preferred embodiments to provide a liquid concentrate quat biocide composition which can be readily diluted with water to provide a working solution which remains biocidally effective for at least 24 hrs notwithstanding the presence of protein, and which in preferred forms of the invention is also effective for cleaning<br>
It is a further object of the preferred embodiments to provide a method for substantially protecting a quat biocide from deactivation by a protein, and compositions employing that method.<br>
It is also an object of certain highly preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a composition including a quat biocide and which has a lower MIC in the presence of a substantial concentration of protein, than a simple solution of the same quat biocide at the same concentration in water in the presence of the same concentration of the protein. By a "substantial concentration" of protein is meant a protein content equivalent to 2 wt.% of water soluble tryptone powder (OXOID product No. L42) by weight of the diluted solution. A protein content equivalent is defined as 16 g of water soluble protein per litre of water, that is to say, not less than 0.54 g per litre water of amino nitrogen as per analysis described in "Nitrogen Compounds. Methods for analysis of musts and wines", pp 172-195; Ough, C.S.; Amerine, M. A. (1988), New York: Witey-lnterscience. t will be understood that improved effectiveness could be expected in the presence of less than 2 wt.% tryptone (or its protein equivalent) and that, for some purposes, satisfactory effectiveness may be retained in the presence of levels greater than 2 wt.% of tryptone {or its protein equivalent).<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect the invention provides a shelf stable liquid disinfectant concentrate composition including at least 1% by weight of a quat biocide and a protein; and wherein said composition is capable of dilution with 20 parts of water to 1 part of concentrate to produce a diluted solution, the diluted solution exhibiting a MIC after 24 hrs in the presence of up to 2% of tryptone (or the protein equivalent thereof) which is<br>
5<br><br>
less than the MIC of a simple solution of the same concentration of the same quat biocide in water in the presence the same concentration of the protein.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention the minimum amount of disinfectant in the diluted solution required to achieve complete kill of Pseudomonas aeroginosa when tested in accordance with the TGA 054 test in the presence of proteinaceous soil is reduced by at least 25% in comparison with a simple solution of the same disinfectant.<br>
By "shelf stable" is meant that the composition retains at least 50% of its biocidal efficacy after 12 months storage in a sealed container at 18 - 25 °C.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention retain better than 98% biocidal efficacy under these conditions.<br>
A concentrate according to the invention may be used at a working dilution in which it is diluted at least 20:1 (i.e. 20 parts of water to 1 part of concentrate) to provide a working solution. In some embodiments of the invention it may be diluted to a much greater extent e.g. 100:1 or 1000:1 or more. However a dilution of 20:1 is used herein for definitional purposes. A 20:1 working dilution is of greater biocidal efficacy than a control which consists of a corresponding simple solution of the same concentration of the same quat biocide in water. Furthermore a working dilution of the concentrate not only retains biocidal activity in the presence of substantial amounts (for example, 2 % by wt. of the diluted solution) of protein, but also, surprisingly, exhibits noticeably greater efficacy than a control. Surprisingly, the achieved level of protection of quat biocide is such that the shelf-stable composition may include proteins in the form of enzymes. In preferred embodiments of the invention the concentrate further includes one or more enzymes and nevertheless retains shelf stability in the concentrate and enzymatic activity in use when diluted as well as having improved biocidal efficacy in use.<br>
Throughout this description MIC is as determined after 24 hrs. Preferably the MIC of a composition according to the invention is less than 75% of the MIC of the corresponding control composition and more preferably is less than 50%.<br>
6<br><br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a shelf stable liquid disinfectant concentrate suitable for use after dilution for disinfection in the presence of protein, said concentrate including: at least 1% by weight of quat biocide and an activity protector selected from the group consisting of "enzyme stabilisers", "enzyme stabilising systems", "micelle formation modifiers and inhibitors", and combinations thereof.<br>
Compositions according to the invention include an "activity protector" which prevents loss of biocidal efficacy of the quat biocide. In preferred embodiments the "activity protector" comprises a boron compound, and more preferably a boron compound in combination with di-(propylene glycol) methyl ether ("DPM") or analogues thereof. Boron compounds have previously been used to protect enzymes from being irreversibly denatured but have not previously been used to protect quat biocidal activity in the presence of proteins. DPM is known to modify micelle formation. It is believed that the "activity protector" could equally utilise (1) one or more other compositions selected from those known to be effective in stabilising enzymes in liquid aqueous solutions, including enzyme stabilising compounds and systems (2) selected "micelle inhibitors", and mixtures of (1) and (2). In highly preferred embodiments of the invention the "activity protector" is an "enzyme stabiliser" and more particularly is a suitable concentration of boron anions. Desirably these are solvated in a polyol and may be combined with enzyme stabilising synergists or adjutants. Preferred "micelle inhibitors" include species known to modify as well as to inhibit micelle formation and are selected from C1 - C6 alkanols, C1 - C6 diols, C2 - C24 alkylene glycol ethers, alkylene glycol alkyl ethers, and mixtures thereof. A highly preferred "micelle inhibitor" is di-(propylene glycol) methyl ether ("DPM").<br>
It has been found that the addition of DPM to an enzyme stabiliser synergistically enhances the activity protection conferred on the quat biocide without detrimental effect on the activity of an enzyme if present.<br>
It is highly preferred that the quat biocide is an aryl quat compound, preferably benzalkonium halide.<br>
7<br><br>
It is well known that enzymes may become denatured in storage, in the presence of other enzymes, and/or in the presence of antagonistic ions such as for example anionic surfactants, quaternary ammonium compounds and detergency "builders". A number of enzyme stabilising systems have been developed and are well known in the enzyme formulation art. An example of an "enzyme stabilising system" is a boron compound (e.g. boric acid) which in the past has been used alone or with selected other adjuvants and or synergists (e.g. polyfunctional amino compounds, antioxidants, etc) to protect proteolytic and other enzymes in storage and in various products. It has been theorised that an enzyme stabilising system such as boron and calcium form intramolecular bonds which effectively cross-link or staple an active site of enzyme molecule so as to hold it in its active spatial configuration. Enzyme stabilisers have not hitherto been used to improve the biocidal activity of a quat biocide. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that at least some enzyme stabilising systems are effective in protecting the biocidal activity of high concentrations of quat biocides, even in the presence of protein, and yet release the biocidal activity upon dilution.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the ratio of "activity protector" e.g. boron to quat biocide is preferably chosen to minimise the MIC of quat biocide in the presence of a given level of protein. It will be understood that the present invention may be used in compositions which combine a quat biocide with one or more enzymes. In a case in which an enzyme is present in addition to the quat biocide and in which it is desired to retain the enzymatic activity of the enzyme as well as the biocidal activity of the quat, biocide then the quantity of "activity protector" required will need to be greater than that required to protect the enzyme and will need to be sufficient to stabilise the enzyme and protect the biocidal activity of the quat biocide. Moreover if the composition is anticipated to come into contact with an external proteinaceous load additional to the enzyme then the "activity protector" concentration will need to be greater still<br>
The inventor has discovered that boron surprisingly protects a quaternary biocide from deactivation by a protein in such a way and to such an extent that the MIC of the biocide is not increased in the presence of a protein.  In preferred<br>
8<br><br>
embodiments of the invention the MIC is dramatically reduced, for example, more than halved notwithstanding the presence of up to 2 wt.% based on the weight of working solution of protein. This allows the formulation of a wide range of new and useful compositions which remain effective as disinfectants or antibacterials in circumstances in which the prior art would be significantly less effective or not effective at all. The invention also enables storage-stable liquid biocidally effective compositions to be prepared with a lower concentration of quat biocide and at much lower cost.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventor speculates that polymeric borate ions associate with the cationic quat biocide, thus protecting the quat from combining with proteins. When the formulation is diluted the polymeric ions become unstable and release the quat for disinfection. Alternatively, it may be that the biocidal activity of the quat biocide significantly relates to denaturing proteins of cell membranes and that boron complexes with charged groups of non-living proteins and prevents wasting quat on denaturing non-living proteins. In any case, as enzymes are structurally quite different from quat biocides, and as the complete mechanism by which quat biocides kill bacteria is also uncertain, it was not previously predictable that any enzyme stabiliser would be effective in maintaining the biocidal activity of a quat biocide (an enzyme antagonist). The mechanism by which the activity of the quat biocide is maintained may be different from that whereby an enzyme is stabilised.<br>
"Activity protectors" are discussed in more detail hereinafter<br>
According to a third aspect the invention provides a composition according to the first aspect further including a nonionic surfactant<br>
Preferably the nonionic surfactant is one or a combination of surfactants selected from the group consisting of ethoxylates or propoxylates and block copolymer of these.<br>
According to a fourth aspect the invention provides a composition according to any one of the preceding aspects including one or more stabilised<br>
9<br><br>
enzymes and wherein the MIC of the biocide at a working dilution is not reduced by a further combination with up to 2 wt.% of protein equivalent by weight of diluted solution.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may be used, for example, and without limitation as a surface spray or treatment for disinfection, aseptic cleansing formulations, for cleaning medical/dental instruments and equipment, for impregnation into cloths and sponges , etc. as well as in consumer products such as dishwasher detergents, household cleaners, shampoo's , disinfecting laundry compositions, and the like. A highly preferred embodiment of the invention, provides an economical effective cleaning and disinfecting composition which contains enzymes, is stable in storage in concentrated or dilute form and on dilution remains biocidal in the presence of protein.<br>
According to a fifth aspect the invention provides a working solution of a disinfectant biocidally effective in the presence of a protein, said solution including at least 0.5% by weight of a quat biocide and capable of dilution with 20 parts of water to 1 part of concentrate to produce a diluted solution, the diluted solution exhibiting a MIC after 24 hrs in the presence of up to 2% of tryptone (or the protein equivalent thereof) which is less than the MIC of a simple solution of the same concentration of the same quat biocide in water in the presence the same concentration of the protein.<br>
According to a sixth aspect the invention provides a working solution of a disinfectant biocidally effective in the presence of a protein including: at least 0.5% by weight of quat biocide, a protein; and an activity protector selected from the group consisting of "enzyme stabilisers", "enzyme stabilising systems" "micelle formation modifiers and inhibitors", and combinations thereof.<br>
According to a seventh aspect the invention provides a method of protecting a quat biocide from deactivation including the steps of combining the quat biocide with an "activity protector" selected from the group consisting of enzyme stabilisers and micelle destabilises or combinations thereof.<br>
10<br><br>
According to other aspects, the invention provides a method of protecting or improving the efficacy of quat biocides in the presence of a protein both in concentrated solutions and at working dilutions thereof and a method of cleaning protein soiled surfaces.<br>
BEST MODES OF PERFORMING THE INVENTION<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described by way of example only<br>
with reference to various embodiments.<br>
Example 1 gives the formulation of a composition which is a concentrate stable in storage but which in use is diluted with water from 200:1 to 1000:1 (parts/wt water to 1 part/wt concentrate). The diluted (200:1) solution is effective as a surface cleaning agent and leaves a disinfectant on the surface which prevents bacterial growth for at least 24 hrs after application. It is as effective if the surface is pretreated with, for example, 2 wt.% tryptone, or 2 wt.% yeast by weight of dilute solution.<br>

Comparative results<br>
The formulation of example 1 and various compositions including subsets of the<br>
components of example 1 were prepared, diluted 20:1 and subjected to MIC<br>
tests as set out in table 1 part A.    The tests were repeated with compositions<br>
further including various proteins as set out in parts B, C, and D<br>
In the following table 1, MIC was measured by the test method described in<br>
Bailey and Scott Diagnostic Microbiology, 8th edition, 1990, p. 177 using one of<br>
the most resistant to QUATs strains of Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC No.<br>
15442.    In table 1, "quat" is an abbreviation for benzyl dimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride quaternary biocide".<br>

Table 1, part A compares the MIC of various quaternary ammonium biocidal compositions in the absence of boron and in the presence of boron (i.e. according to the invention) but in the absence of protein. In each case comparison may be made with a control - "quat" (no boron)<br>
Table 1 part A shows that Terric GN9 deactivates the quat biocide as would be expected. Unexpectedly, DPM enhances the activity of a quat even in the presence of GN9, while in each case the combination with Boron according to the invention produces a marked improvement in biocidal efficacy in comparison with the combination lacking boron and with the control<br>
Table 1 part B shows that in the presence of a protein ( 2 wt.% tryptone) and in the absence of boron the quaternary biocide is substantially deactivated. The degree of deactivation is reduced by DPM even in the presence of non ionic surfactant GN9. However, the addition of the boron anions at least halves the MIC in the presence of the protein in each case. Compositions with boron according to the invention have a much lower MIC than the control quat biocide with tryptone and no other additive. DPM unexpectedly enhances this effect<br>
Table 1 part C shows corresponding results for a mixture of natural proteins in baking yeast, and table 1 part D shows the results for a third protein proteolytic enzyme subtilisin. It is noteworthy that there is a further improvement in efficacy of the quaternary biocide (reduction in MIC) in each case when DPM is combined with the boron (i.e. the combination of DPM with boron synergistically improves the activity protection of the boron) in comparison with compositions lacking boron or DPM. Moreover this synergism occurs notwithstanding the deactivation effect of GN9<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in example 2. The composition of example 2 is a concentrate intended for dilution 1 part/wt concentrate in 200 parts/wt water. The composition is intended for application as a pre-soak for surgical instruments<br>

The invention has been exemplified by reference to alkyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (also known as benzalkonium chloride) as the highly preferred quat biocide. However those skilled in the art will recognise that other monomeric quaternary ammonium antimicrobial compounds may be used.<br>

Wherein R' R" R'" R"" are alkyl radicals that may be the same or different, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched, and cyclic or acyclic. X is any anion but preferably a halogen, more preferable chlorine or bromine.<br>
Highly preferred antimicrobial compounds are mono-long chain, tri-short chain, tetralkyl ammonium compounds, di-long-chain, di-short chain tetralkyl ammonium compounds and mixtures thereof, where by "long" chain is meant about C 6 - C 30 alky!, and by "short" chain is meant C 1 - C 5 alkyl, preferably C1 - C 3, or benzyl, or C 1 - C 3 alkylbenzyj. Examples include monoalkyltrimethyl ammonium salts such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), monoalkyldimethylbenzyl compounds or dialkylbenzyl compounds. Quat biocides such as chlorhexadine gluconate may be employed.<br>
The most highly preferred compounds for use in the invention have at least one benzyl radical which may be a substituted benzyl. Examples include C8 - C22 dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride , C8 - C22 dimethyl ethyl benzyl ammonium chloride and di- C6 - C20 alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride The quaternary ammonium compound is incorporated for broad spectrum (gram positive and gram negative) antibacterial properties and should be present at least in an amount which would be effective for that purpose in the absence of protein or other deactivator. It is surprising that compositions according to the invention have excellent shelf stability both in concentrated and dilute form<br>
Activity Protector<br>
According to the invention the biocidal activity of the quaternary biocide is in use protected by an "activity protector" which is a composition (an ion, compound, or combination thereof) selected from the group of known "enzyme stabilising systems" including both reversible and irreversible enzyme inhibitors such as described in "Handbook of Enzyme Inhibitors", Zollner H., 2nd ed. VCH 1993.<br>
15<br><br>
The preferred activity protector is a boron compound or more preferably a mixture of a boron compound and a polyol The boron compound may for example be boric acid, boric oxide, borax, or sodium ortho-, meta-, or pyro-borate. In some formulations it may be desirable to use a perborate, such as sodium perborate to obtain a bleaching effect The most preferred boron source is sodium tetraborate. The protective effect of the boron compound may be enhanced by the presence of formate, or calcium ion, or by polyfunctional amino compounds such as di- or tri-ethanolamine. Other activity protection enhancers, or adjuvants, include anions such as phosphates, citrates, sulphates and sequestering agents such as used as water softeners such as EDTA.<br>
Polyol<br>
In systems which use boron to stabilise enzymes the addition of antioxidants and /or polyfunctional amino compounds has been reported to produce a synergistic enzyme stabilising effect and the use of such enzyme stabiliser synergists in the present system is contemplated. The term "enzyme stabiliser systems" is used herein to denote combinations of stabilisers with enhancers, adjuvants and/or synergists and the like.<br>
The polyol is preferably one containing from 2 -6 hydroxyl groups and containing only C, H, and O atoms. Typical examples are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol 1,2 propanediol, butyleneglycol and most preferably glycerol. Other polyols such as mannitol, sorbitol, erythritol, glucose, fructose, lactose, etc may also be useful. The polyol is selected to solvate the boron and increase its ionic strength in the composition and will usually be present in an amount at least equal to the amount of boron compound.<br>
Micelle Inhibitors<br>
A water miscible solvent is desirably included to assist in solubilising the components and/or substances with which the composition comes into contact depending on its intended use and avoid or inhibit or modify micelle formation. This acts synergistically as an "activity protector" as well as apparently in some instances enhancing biocidal activity in its own right.<br>
16<br><br>
Preferably a water miscible solvent is selected from C1 - C6 alkanol, C1 - C6 diols, C3 - C24 alkylene glycol ethers, alkylene glycol alky ethers and mixtures thereof. A highly preferred solvent is di (propylene glycol) methyl ether. Other known micelle antagonists include borates, lactates, citrates, tartrates.<br>
Enzymes<br>
The boron stabiliser is added in an amount required to prevent deactivation of the surfactant in the presence of protein. Surprisingly it has been found possible to include one or more enzymes in compositions according to the invention and to provide sufficient boron in the composition both to protect the quat biocide from deactivation by the enzyme, and to protect the quat biocide from deactivation by an additional protein (i.e. additional to the enzyme) and also to stabilise the enzymes against being denatured by the quat It may be that a complex of the quat (e.g. with the protein) participates in reversibly protecting the enzyme. The enzymes may for example be proteolytic enzymes or selected from carbohydrases, esterases, hydrazes, amylases, proteases, catalases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, peroxidases, invertases, and the like together with mixtures thereof.<br>
Surfactant<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention a surfactant is present.<br>
The surfactant is a non-ionic surfactant and it is highly preferred that it be<br>
selected from alkoxylated alcohols, alkoxylated phenol ethers. Other semipolar<br>
nonionics such  as trialkyl  amine oxides may also  be  useful.  Examples of<br>
alkoxylated  phenol  ethers include octyl or nonyl  phenol  ether with varying<br>
degrees of alkoxylation.   6-10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of phenol is<br>
preferred.  The alkyl group can vary from C6 - C16 The more highly preferred<br>
are low alkoxylated nonionics having   6-25   moles of ethylene oxide and/or<br>
propylene oxide per molecule.<br>
The alkoxylated alcohols include ethoxylated and propoxylated C6 -C16 alcohols with about 2-10 moles of ethylene oxide, or 1-10 and 1-10 moles of ethylene and propylene oxide per mole of alcohol respectively.<br>
17<br><br>
If amine oxides are used these may be mono-long chain, di-short chain, trialkylamine oxides and can be ethoxylated or propoxylated. an example is lauryl amine oxide, or cocoamidopropyldirnethylamine oxide.<br>
The quantity of surfactant is chosen so as to provide sufficient detergency for soil removal, and will typically be in the range of from 0.05% to 10% of the concentrate more preferably about 0.5% to 6% and most preferably from 2% -4%.<br>
The fact that certain monomeric quat biocides do not require to be rinsed even from food-contacting surfaces when applied at low levels provides an opportunity to formulate single-step cleaners/disinfectants, useful on food contacting surfaces soiled by proteinous soils.<br>
The invention is herein described with particular reference to boron as the "activity protector". It may be that not all enzyme stabiliser systems are effective as quat biocide activity protectors, but those which are and are not effective can be determined by routine screening based upon the teaching hereof. The invention may be embodied in many forms which will be apparent to those skilled in the arts of product formulation based upon the teaching herein contained.<br>
