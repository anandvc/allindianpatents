NAZOLINE DERIVATIVES WHICH PROMOTE THE RELEASE OF PARATHYROID HORMONE<br>
QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES<br>
This invention relates to bicyclic compounds, in particular to 4-aryl-2(lH)-quinazolinone derivatives and 2-substituted-4-aryl-quinazoline derivatives and to new pharmaceutical uses thereof.<br>
4-Aryl-2(lH)-quinazolinone derivatives have been described and proposed for therapeutic use as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agents; for example,<br><br>
Similarly 2-substituted-4-aryl-quinazolines have been described and proposed for use as anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic agents. Thus, for example, EP 0 567 107 A (Takeda) describes the preparation of quinoline and quinazoline derivatives and their use as antinflammatory agents, in particular for treating arthritis. Takeda also propose (EP 0 634 169A) similar quinoline and quinazoline derivatives for use in inhibiting bone resorption and treating osteoporosis, and further propose such compounds for use as immunosuppressants for treatment of various autoimmune diseases.<br>
We have now found that certain 4-aryl-2(lH)-quinazolinone derivatives and 2-substituted-4-aryl-quinazoline derivatives have additional desirable activities which indicate that these derivatives may be useful in additional pharmaceutical applications.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides use of a compound of formula I<br><br><br>
Rl represents from 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from OH, SH, halo,<br>
NO2, optionally substituted (lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, lower<br>
alkenyloxy, lower alkynyl, lower alkynyloxy, lower alkanoyl, lower alkylsulphone,<br>
lower alkylsulphoxide or amino);<br>
R2 is H or optionally substituted (lower alkyl, aryl, aryl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl-lower alkyl or carbonyl lower alkyl);<br>
R3 represents from 1 to 3 substituents selected from halo, optionally substituted<br>
(lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, lower alkoxy or amino);<br>
R4' which is cyano, halo, azide (-N=N=N) or optionally substituted (lower alkyl,<br>
lower alkoxy, lower thioalkoxy, aryloxy, aryl lower alkoxy or amino),<br>
or a pharmaceutically-acceptable and -cleavable ester, or acid addition salt thereof,<br>
for the preparation of a medicament for promoting the release of parathyroid<br>
hormone.<br><br>
It is now well established that controlled treatment of patients with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and analogues and fragments thereof can have a pronounced anabolic effect on bone formation. Thus compounds which promote PTH release, such as the compounds for use in the present invention may be used for preventing or treating conditions of bone which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable.<br>
Thus in a further aspect the invention includes a method for preventing or treating bone conditions which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable in which an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable and -cleavable ester, or acid addition salt thereof is administered to a patient in need of such treatment.<br>
In a yet further aspect the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating bone conditions which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable comprising a compound of formula I as defined above, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable and -cleavable ester, or acid addition salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.<br>

The Agents of the Invention, as defined above, e.g., of formula I, particularly as exemplified, in free or phaimaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, exhibit pharmacological activity and are useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g. for therapy, in the treatment of diseases and conditions as hereinafter set forth.<br>
Inositol phosphate formation assay:<br>
To determine antagonistic activity at the human parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (PCaR), compounds were tested in functional assays measuring the inhibition of calcium-induced inositol phosphate formation in CCL39 fibroblasts stably transfected with human PCaR.<br>
Cells were seeded into 24 well plates and grown to confluence. Cultures were then labeled with [3H]inositol (74 Mbq/ml) in serum-free medium for 24h. After labeling, cells were washed once with a modified Hepes-buffered salt solution (mHBS: 130 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KC1, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgS04, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). and incubated with mHBS at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mM LiCl to block inositol monophosphatase activity. Test compounds were added 3 minutes before stimulating PCaR with 5.5 mM calcium and incubations continued for further 20 min. Thereafter, cells were extracted with 10 mM ice-cold formic acid and inositol phosphates formed were determined using anion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Assay for intracellular free calcium:<br>
An alternative method to determine antagonism at the PCaR consists in measuring the inhibition of intracellular calcium transients stimulated by extracellular calcium. CCL39 fibroblasts stably transfected with human PCaR were seeded at 40'000 cells /well into 96-well Viewplates and incubated for 24 hours. Medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 2 microM Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), In routine experiments, cells were incubated at 37°C, 5 % CO2 for 1 h. Afterwards, plates were washed twice with mHBS and wells were refilled with 100 microl mHBS containing the test compounds. Incubation was continued at room temperature for 15 minutes. To record changes of intracellular free calcium, plates were transferred to fluorescence-imaging plate reader (Molecular<br><br>
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A baseline consisting in 5 measurements of 0.4 seconds each (laser excitation 488 nm) was recorded. Cells were then stimulated with calcium (2.5 mM final), and fluorescence changes recorded over a period of 3 minutes.<br>
When measured in the above assays, Agents of the Invention typically have IC50S in the range from about 50 µM down to about 10 nM or less.<br>
Agents of the Invention are accordingly indicated for preventing or treating all bone conditions which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable, e.g. osteoporosis of various genesis (e.g. juvenile, menopausal, postmenopausal, post-traumatic, caused by old age or by cortico-steroid therapy or inactivity), fractures, osteopathy, including acute and chronic states associated with skeletal demineralisation, osteo-malacia, periodontal bone loss or bone loss due to arthritis or osteoarthritis or for treating hypoparathyroidism.<br>
Further diseases and disorders which might be prevented or treated include e.g. seizures, stroke, head trauma, spinal cord injury, hypoxia-induced nerve cell damage such as in cardiac arrest or neonatal distress, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, dementia, muscle tension, depression, anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, congestive heart failure; hypertension; gut motility disorders such as diarrhea, and spastic colon and dermatological disorders, e.g. in tissue healing, for example burns, ulcerations and wounds.<br>
The Agents of the Invention are particularly indicated for preventing or treating osteoporosis of various genesis.<br>
For all the above uses, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 0.03 to about 300 mg preferably 0.03 to 30, more preferably 0.1 to 10 mg of a compound of<br><br>
the invention. Agents of the Invention may be administered twice a day or up to twice a week.<br>
The Agents of the Invention may be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. Such salts may be prepared in conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free compounds. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an Agent of the Invention in free base form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such compositions may be formulated in conventional manner. The Agents of the Invention may be administered by any conventional route, for example parenterally e.g. in form of injectable solutions or suspensions, enterally, e.g. orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules or in a transdermal, nasal or a suppository form.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing the present invention further provides:<br>
a) an Agent of the Invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use as a pharmaceutical;<br>
b)a method for preventing or treating above mentioned disorders and diseases in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of an Agent of the Invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
c) an Agent of the Invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition e.g. for use in the method as in b) above.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the Agents of the Invention may be employed as adjunct or adjuvant to other therapy, e.g. a therapy using a bone resorption inhibitor, for example as in osteoporosis therapy, in particular a therapy employing calcium, a calcitonin or an analogue or derivative thereof, e.g. salmon, eel<br><br>
or human calcitonin, a steroid hormone, e.g. an estrogen, a partial estrogen agonist or estrogen-gestagen combination, a SERM (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator) e.g. raloxifene, lasofoxifene, TSE-424, FC1271, Tibolone (Livial ®), vitamin D or an analog thereof or PTH, a PTH fragment or a PTH derivative e.g. PTH (1-84), PTH (1-34), PTH (1-36), PTH (1-38), PTH (1-31)NH; or PTS 893.<br>
When the Agents of the Invention are administered in conjunction with, e.g. as an adjuvant to bone resorption inhibition therapy, dosages for the co-administered inhibitor will of course vary depending on the type of inhibitor drug employed, e.g. whether it is a steroid or a calcitonin, on the condition to be treated, whether it is a curative or preventive therapy, on the regimen and so forth.<br><br><br><br>
