				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is safety following water vehicle of fig. No. -(1),(2)&amp; (3).<br>
i) Safety floating water vehicle of fig. No. -(1) is comprising of deck and bottom characterized in that inside of the bottom portion is filled with light solid substance like thermocol so that it must not sink into water in any condition of leak-age, cracking position or in case of turning out.<br>
ii) Safety floating water vehicle of fig. No.-(2) same as fig.no. -(1) with a feature of supporting element which is provided at the side portion and bottom portion by which it must not turn out easily. A all around cornish whose inside is filled with light solid substance like thermocol exists in the side portion. Out side of the under surface of the bottom is divided into three parts and Two side portions of the bottom (^) is further extended towards the bottom then the middle portion.<br>
iii) Safety floating water vehicle of fig. No. -(3) is hexagonally shaped and is comprising of protective part and dwelling part. Inside of the protective part is filled with light solid substance like thermocol. So it must not sink into water like fig. No. - (1). Dwelling part exists on so many half spherical chassis those are resting in so many spherical rooms on all round wheels inside the protective part and is able to move or communicate easily in such rooms. For this the dwelling part gives the passengers same and safety position in spite of turning over protective part i.e. safety floating water vehicle of fig.No.- (3) as the dwelling part contains heavy weight.<br>
t<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION WITH REGARD TO THE DRAWBACK OF ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN ART.<br>
A common technique of making floating water vehicle:<br>
Shape of the floating water vehicle is developed in such way that huge buoyant force can be achieved and it floats in water easily. If a hole is found accidentally inside the floating water vehicle then the bottom portion of the floating water vehicle is becoming full of water and by which it sinks into water gradually as its weight is more than the displaced water or necessary buoyant force.<br>
But if inside of the bottom of the floating water vehicle is filled with the light solid substance like thermocol then water will not be able to occupy its place by removing the solid substance. Ly this way the water displaced by the floating water vehicle will almost remain same whatever may be the condition, which will arise at the time of any type of calamities.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Related art or known art of the invention is found in patent No. GB191226830. This knov.-a art wherein several rubber bags with strong fabrics are used with necessary metal disk which is unsemetrically pivoted weighted and mounted in a screwed 'U' shaped tube of the boat.<br>
The system is complicated in designed and involving with more cost. The prior art problem can be overcome by the present invention.<br>
a-<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention of safety floating water vehicle of fig.No.- (1) is comprising of deck, item a and bottom, (&amp;) characterized in that the inside portion of bottom, {&amp;) is filled with light solid substance like thermocal. For this water through leak-age or crack will not be able to occupy its place inside the bottom by removing the solid substance and the displaced water by the water vehicle will almost remain same what ever may be the condition which will arise at the time of any type of calamities. So it will not sink into water.<br>
Safety water vehicle of fig.No.- (2) is same as the fig. No. - (1) wherein two supporting elements, all round Cornish, (&amp;) and two side portion of the bottom is further extended towards the bottom then the middle portion, (d) are provided at the side and bottom portion respectively so that the water vehicle must not turn out easily and it will not sink like the fig. No. - (1) also.<br>
Safety floating water vehicle of fig. No.- (3) is comprising of protective part ("-) &amp; (&amp;) and dwelling part {d) &amp; (e^). Inside of the protective part is filled with light solid substance like themocol and it is all around the dwelling part. So the vehicle will not sink into water like the fig. no.- (1). Further it comprises spherical rooms, (c). (d) is half spherical chassis of dwelling part and is resting in spherical rooms (o) on all round wheels (e) and is able to rotate around the inner territory of (c) i.e. spherical rooms. For this dwelling part gives the passengers same and safety position in spite of turning over the protective part i.e. safety floating water vehicle of fig. No. (3) as the dwelling part contains heavy weight.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The invention is illustrated in. the accompanying drawing of fig. No. - (1), (2) &amp; (3).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
OF INVENTION<br>
The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawing in which<br>
1)	Safety floating water vehicle of fig.No. -(1) is comprising of deck ("-) and bottom<br>
portion (&amp;). Passenger can stand on the deck made of hard substance. The inside<br>
portion of the bottom, (&amp;) is filled with light solid substance like thermocol. So<br>
water through leak-age or crack will not be able to occupy its place inside the<br>
bottom by removing the solid substance. So the displaced water by the water<br>
vehicle will be the same in all condition. For this it will not sink into water.<br>
2)	Safety floating water vehicle of fig. No. -(2) is comprising of deck {w} where<br>
passengers can stand and a cornish surrounding of the vehicle between its deck<br>
and outer water level, {&amp;) and bottom portion, (o) and  two   side portions of the<br>
bottom (d) is further extended towards the bottom than the middle portion.<br>
(&amp;) &amp; (d) in (section A-A) are supporting element, by which the vehicle will not be able to turn out easily and its floating capacity also increases more. Inner portion of the bottom and cornish are filled with light solid substance like thermocol. But the cover of the vehicle is made of hard solid substance. Safety floating water vehicle, fig.No.- (2) will not sink into water like the fig. No -(1). In (Section A-A), two side portions of the bottom (d) is further extended towards the bottom than the middle portion so that it will be able to act as a pillar by the help of stagnant water in it between two up portions for controlling the disbalance of the water vehicle on water and the cornish gives the water vehicle an extra support so that it will not be able to turn out easily.<br>
3)	Safety floating water vehicle of Fig.No.- (3). is comprising of w, b,o,<l sc></l>
{a) &amp; (&amp;) are the protective part of this water vehicle. Inner portion of this part is filled with light solid substance like thermocol and its cover is made of hard solid substance. For this it will not sink into water like the first kind. (In section B-B) (o), is the spherical rooms inside the protective part. (In section B-B) (d), is the half spherical chassis of the dwelling part. (e
