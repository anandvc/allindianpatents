COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
Title: A method  to manufacture an Ophthalmic Pharmaceutical Preparation.<br>
Applicants: FDC LIMITED , and Indian Company  incroporated within the meaning of the Comany's Act 1956, and having their registered address at B,8, M.I.D.C Industrial Area, Waluj, Maharastra 431135, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performned:<br>
GRANTED<br>
29/11/2005<br><br><br><br>
Field of Invention: Tlie invention relates to a method to manufacture opthalmic pharmaceutical<br>
   preparation of anti- inflammatory agents in the nature of steroids and an anti-infective agent.<br>
Back ground of invention:<br>
Anti-infective agents, in the form of antibacterial agents or antibiotics, and anti¬inflammatory agents in the nature of steroids, have been used in combination for eflFective control of infection and inflammation.. Use of such combination drugs of appropriate antibacterial agents and steroids helps in increasing patient compliance to therapy as it reduces the number of instillation of different drugs. This is specially true in the case of ophthalmic treatment, when the number of instillation of drags requires to be minimal.<br>
Not only is a combination of steroid and antibiotic or antibacterial agents desirable, but it is also essential that the combination when required for ophthahnic purposes is available a as a clear formulation, either as a solution or a gel.<br>
In formulations, for ophthahnic treatment, a clear formulation is highly desirable, because any formulation in suspension form causes irritation to the eye, as well as causes crust formation around the eye. The U.S. Patent No.5472954 describes a process by which the solubility of lipophilic or sparingly soluble active ingredients (drug/ cosmetic/ agrochemical) is increased by complexing with different derivatives of cyclodextrin. This patent only describes a process by which a single active ingredient can be made soluble by complexing it with cyclodextrin derivatives.<br>
In post operative ophthahnic treatment, where in a combination therapy of antibacterial and anti- inflammatory agent is used, a clear formulation is liighly desired. Even in non-operative cases ophthahnic preparations in clear formulation is preferred to a suspension, as a preferred line of treatment, as it increases the physical and physiological acceptance of the medication.<br>
Ciprofloxacin, which ts a quinolone derivative, and a broad spectrum antibacterial, and considered a 'standard' for the treatment of ocular bacterial infections is currently available in local markets in combination with the steroid dexamethasone only in a suspension form. In addition U.S. Patent No: 6,284,804 describes a suspension<br><br>
formulation containing dexamethasone and ciprofloxacin together with a non-ionic polymer, non-ionic surfactant and an ionic tonicity agent.<br>
Though the above combination is known to be effective against most ocular pathogens, it is not preferred for use in post- operative cases, because it is currently available only in suspension form. An instillation of a drug in suspension form results in crust formation around the eye causing a foreign bodylike feeling in the eye and irritation. Steroids are generally sparingly soluble in aqueous solution which is the reason for most anti-infectiveagent / steroid combinations being available in suspension form. The antibacterial and the steroid in the form of their salts are individually available as a clear solution, but the combination, does not give a stable clear solution. On standing turbidity appears in the mixture of antibacterial- steroid solution.<br>
Further a mere admixture of antibiotic or antibacterial agent in clear solution and the steroid in clear solution, usually results in the crystallization of the antibacterial because of the higher pH used to dissolve the steroid, and the steroid itself degrades in a short time when mixed with the antibacterial.<br>
WO 90/ 01933 describes an invention for an opthalmic preparation consisting of a broad spectrum quinalone and a steroid like dexamethasone. The invention refers to the use of complexing agents like cyclodextrin and viscosity agents like PVA. However the invention does not mention a formulation where because of the critical ratio between the co-complexing agent and the PVA, a clear stable solution is obtained. A clear satble solution is a  decided advantage in respect of opthalmic formulations, for use in post operative treatment, since it prevents crust formation around the eye and irritation caused by particulate formation.<br>
The present invention describes for the first time a process by which a steroid and antibacterial could be combined to form a complex which could be used in the preparation of a clear solution, where in the activity and bio-efficacy of the antibacterial and steroid are not m anyway hampered or affected. The process would be particularly ideal in the preparation of fornulations for ophthalmic treatment. The<br><br>
clear solution or clear gels of anti-bacterials and steroid, would be specially suitable as a preferred form of drug administration in post operative ophthalmic cases.<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
In its main aspect the invention consists of a process to manufacture a combination drug comprising of an anti inflammatory agent and an anti-infective agent. The anti-inflammatory agent in this invention is a cortico-steroid , and the anti-infective agent is either a quinolone derivative, amino-glycoside derivative or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The process essentially consists of (i) including the steroid within a solubilizer, which exhibits an inclusion phenomena The steroid is included mthin β-cyclodextrin which acts as a solubilizer cum complexing agent, to form a solubilser-steroid complex, where in the solubiliser and steroid are in the ratio of 1M:2M to 1M:6M; .(ii) dispersing or dissolving the anti infective agent in a suitable solvent which is subsequently or simultaneously diluted with a complexation enhancing water soluble polymer solution to give an anti-infective agent polymer solution; (iii) Controlled addition of anti-infective agent polymer solution to steroid-solubiliser blend to form a water soluble complex of anti-mfective agent, steroid polymer and solubiliser; (iv) Incorporating the complex m a carrier system, to give a stable pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
In another aspect, this invention consists of a process to manufacture a stable pharmaceutical preparation, which is a combination drug of a corticosteroid from the group consisting of fluoromethalone, dexamethasone, beta-methasone, corticosterone, prednisolone, and their derivatives essentially having a common nuclear structure Pregna -1, 4 - diene -3,20 dione. The anti-infective agents are either quinolone derivatives selected from the group consisting of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacm, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin and its salts or tobramycin, gentamicin and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives and salts.<br>
In a further aspect of this invention, the solubihser is selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrin and its derivatives preferably Beta cyclodextrin, and the complexation enhancing polymer used is selected from the group consisting of non-ionic polymers like polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose or HPMC (hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose) or hydroxy ethyl cellulose.<br><br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the complex that is formed of the anti-infective agent-steroid-solubiliser and polymer is either incorporated in a suitable carrier system or lyophilised and later incorporated in a suitable carrier system, which may be water, gel or ointment base.<br>
In the final aspect of this invention, the complex when incorporated in a carrier system of water or gel together with suitable excipients results in a clear and stable pharmaceutical preparation, suitable for ocular treatment.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
A brief description of the invention is as follows:<br>
In its main embodiment, the invention consists of a process of manufacturing a combination drug comprising of i. Anti-inflammatory agents which are cortico¬steroids and ii.Anti-infective agents from the group consisting of quinolone derivatives, aminoglycoside derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The process consists of the following steps: i. Including the steroid within a solubiliser, which also acts as a complexing agent and exhibits an inclusion phenomena, to form a solubiliser steroid complex. The steroid and solubiliser are taken in desired amounts and mixed thoroughly in a polybag to form a blended complex. The ratio in which the steroid and solubilizer are taken depends on the steroid and the anti-infective agent used. The solubiliser used is cyclodextrin or its derivatives, preferably Beta cyclodextrin. The solubiliser and steroid are used in the critical ratio of 1M:2M to IM:6M.Ths use of Beta cyclodextrin makes this process particularly cost effective.<br>
ii. Dispersing or dissolving the anti-infective agent in a suitable solvent preferably water. The solvent and anti-infective agent are stirred to form a slurry. A complexation enhancing polymer solution is added to the slurry and sufficient water is further added  and stirred for 10 to 30 minutes to form a clear anti-<br><br>
infective agent polymar sohition. Dispertion is usually earned out at a tamperature between 20° to 50° C, preferably ambient temperature. The sohition is maitained at a pH  range between 4 to 7,<br>
iii. Controlled addition of anti-infective agent polymer solution to steroid solubiliser blend with constant stirring to form a water soluble  complex of anti-infective agent-staroid -polymer and solubiliser. The addition can even be done at room tamperature. The clarity of the final solution is dependant on the crucial ratio of the anti-infective agent polymer solution to the steroid-solubiliser blend. The ratio depends upon the type of anti-infective agent and anti-inflamatory agent used. If the ratio is disturbed the clarity of the final solution is affected. The comlexation usually occurs within 30 minutes. The compex formed is stable up to a temperature of 50°C.<br>
iv. Incorporating the complex in a carrier system The complex may be incorporated in water, ointment base or a gel togethw with suitable excipients, depending upon the  final purpose of its use.<br>
The complex when dissolved in water, along with excipients, forms a clear stable solution which is very suitable for ocular treatment. A geling polymer may be used as a carrier system, if the final commercial product is desired in a gel fonn. Geling polymer that are used may be one or more among hydroxy propylmethyl cellulose, carbomer or its derivatives, carboxy methyl cellulose or methyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose. The excipients used are benzalkonium chloride as preservative, disodium EDTA as chelating agent, mono or dibasic sodium phosphate as a buffering agent, and sodium chloride as tonicity adjustor. NaCl is added in such a proportion so as to obtain an osmolality of about 270-320 mOsm in the final composition .In respect of gel  preparations sorbitol is used as tonicity adjustor. In its preferred embodiment the steroids used are selected from the group having a general nuclear structure Pregna - 1, 4 - diene - 3, 20 dione which could be dexamethasone, fluoromethalone, Betamethasone, corticosterone, prednisolone and such ohers . The anti-infective agents are slected from the group consisting of derivatives of Ciprofloxacin, , Ofloxacin, sparfloxadn. Norfloxacin, Tobramycin sulphate gentamicin sulphate and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The concentration of the anti-infective in the final solution ranges from 3 to 5% weight by<br><br>
volume, and that of steroid ranges from .l%to .3% weight by volume in the final ftnal solution.<br>
The  following  examples  specifically  describe  the  process   for  the  different combinations of steroids and anti-infective agents used in the various carrier systems.<br>
