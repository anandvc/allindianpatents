				<td>Diffractive microstructure and a method of producing the same<br>
The present invention concerns a diffractive microstructure according to the preamble of<br>
claim 1.<br>
A microstructure of the present kind comprises micro-protrusions or microgrooves or a<br>
combination thereof formed in a layer of a thermoplastic polymer.<br>
The present invention also concerns a method according to the preamble of claim 24 for<br>
producing diffractive microstructures.<br>
There is a growing interest in providing means for identification of fibrous materials and<br>
for verifying the origin thereof. An object is to prevent or at least making more difficult the<br>
production and distribution of counterfeit goods packed in such materials. As specific<br>
examples of important goods can be mentioned medicines and tobacco products packed in<br>
cardboard packages.<br>
Examples of safety features (in the following also "safety markings") incorporated into<br>
fibrous materials include various tags and labels allowing for optical or electrical<br>
identification of the materials. In particular, there are a number of RFID and barcode tag<br>
solutions known in the art. One problem related to present day tags and labels is that they<br>
have to be attached to the surface of, e.g., the cardboard, in a separate process step.<br>
Depending on how they are fixed to the cardboard surface, for example by use of<br>
adhesives, there is always a risk that they might fall off during handling or conversion.<br>
There is also a considerable risk that separate safety markings are copied and used for<br>
counterfeiting of the product.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to eliminate at least a part of the problems related to<br>
the known art and to provide a technical solution for incorporating safety markings<br>
integrally into fibrous product during production so as to allow for identification of the<br>
origin of the product and for preventing manipulation of a product by attachment of a<br>
separate tag or label.<br>
Embossing methods for forming diffractive microstructured areas on surface layers of<br>
substrates are known in the art (cf. for instance WO 2006/07053 and WO 2006/056660).<br>
According to WO 2006/051170 an optical diffraction element is formed directly on the<br>
surface of a substrate, using its surface material which, in the case of paper or cardboard, is<br>
a top layer suitable formed by a coating paste, size, resin, extrusion coating, surface<br>
lacquer or printing ink, which can be processed to create a microstructure forming the<br>
optical diffraction element, for example by embossing.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that it is possible to form optically<br>
identifiable microstructures on the surface of a fibrous product by hot-pressing of a<br>
specific kind of layer present on the surface of the product or which forms a part of the<br>
product, viz. a layer formed by thermoplastic carbohydrate polymer or derivatives thereof.<br>
In particular, the present invention comprises using, as a substrate for the embossing<br>
operation, a layer of a thermoplastic carbohydrate polymer or a polymer derived from a<br>
carbohydrate material, said polymer having a glass transition point of less than 210 °C.<br>
The diffractive microstructure can be produced by a method comprising the steps of<br>
- forming a layer of a thermoplastic carbohydrate polymer having a glass transition<br>
point of less than 210 °C; and<br>
- embossing into the layer a diffractive microstructure comprising micro-protrusions<br>
or microgrooves or a combination thereof.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is mainly characterized by what is stated in the<br>
characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The method according to the present invention is characterized by what is stated in the<br>
characterizing part of claim 24.<br>
Considerable advantages are obtained by the invention. Thus, the invention provides an<br>
inexpensive and reliable way of incorporating into the products safety markings, which<br>
allow for visual inspection or detection e.g. based on polychromatic light or based on the<br>
use of laser beams and other monochromatic light. Typically, the present microstructure is<br>
capable of diffracting light in the visual range, in the ultraviolet range, in the infrared range<br>
or in a broad wavelength range comprising visual, ultraviolet and/or infrared light.<br>
The microstructures can be impressed into the surface of the materials during the<br>
production process.<br>
The polymers used in the invention are biocompatible and, in some cases, even<br>
biodegradable materials. The biocompatibility allows for the use of the polymer layers in<br>
foodstuff packagings and wrappings of other products which must meet stringent<br>
requirements, e.g. as cigarette papers. The cost for the application of the marking is small<br>
compared to the cost of the product and its package. Further, no additional processing of<br>
the embossed surfaces is required for achieving visually complete and mechanically<br>
durable decorations.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following<br>
detailed description of particularly preferred embodiments.<br>
As was discussed above, the present invention provides novel diffractive microstructure in<br>
layers formed by thermoplastic carbohydrate polymers and polymers derived from such<br>
materials. The microstructures can be used as a safety marking, as an identification<br>
marking or for decorative purposes ("rainbow colours"). They are useful also for brand<br>
promotion.<br>
Generally speaking, the pattern typically comprises a plurality of mechanical deformations,<br>
which upon reflection of incident waves of light, in particular light having a wave length<br>
within the range of visible light, will produce a diffractive pattern. The pattern can produce<br>
varying visual effects depending on the observation angle relative to the light sources<br>
present.<br>
A suitable pattern can be formed of engravings, i.e., pits or microgrooves, which extend<br>
from the surface of the varnish into the varnish layer. It can also be formed by rises, micro-<br>
protrusions which extend from the surface of the varnish layer away from the surrounding<br>
surface level.<br>
The grooves or protrusions can also be of variable depth, breadth and height, respectively.<br>
Typically they have a smallest dimension in the range of light, i.e. visible only or the range<br>
from UV to visible or visible to IR or in the broad range from UV to IR. Dimensions<br>
outside the indicated ranges are also possible. Thus, generally, the smallest dimension of<br>
the grooves and ridges of the microstructures are in the range of about 10 nm to 1500 nm,<br>
in particular about 50 nm to 1000 nm, and preferably about 75 to 800 nm.<br>
Based on the foregoing, the present diffractive microstructures can comprise cinegrams,<br>
exelgrams or holograms and other structures (barcodes), which are detectable by visual<br>
inspection. In one preferred embodiment, the diffractive pattern comprises a<br>
holographically imaged pattern (a hologram), which gives a three dimensional impression<br>
to the viewer.<br>
The visual markings can be complemented with codes which are invisible to the naked eye<br>
but which can be read with a separate reader.<br>
The present microstructures comprising micro-protrusions or microgrooves or a<br>
combination thereof are formed into a surface comprising or even consisting of a<br>
thermoplastic biocompatible polymer.<br>
One embodiment of a layer having a diffractive microstructure according to the present<br>
invention comprises a self-supporting layer or film wherein the diffractive microstructure<br>
has been impressed upon the film as such. Another embodiment comprises a layer applied<br>
to the surface of a fibrous web or sheet or similar planar substrate, said layer having been<br>
embossed to provide a diffractive microstructure.<br>
In the embodiment of the self-supporting layer, the polymer film has preferably a thickness<br>
of about 0.1 to 100 micrometres, in particular about 0.5 to 50 micrometres. The film<br>
comprises for example a polymer selected from the group of poly(lactic acid), polylactide<br>
and polycaprolactone.<br>
Naturally, it should be understood that the self-supporting film need not be continuous but<br>
can be deposited on supporting substrate such as another polymer film or a fibrous web or<br>
sheet.<br>
In the embodiment where the layer is deposited on a substrate, the layer may have a similar<br>
thickness as explained above, preferably about 0.1 to 50 micrometres. Typically, this layer<br>
is formed from starch and starch derivatives or other carbohydrates and derivatives thereof<br>
which do not form a film (cf. below).<br>
The biocompatible polymer of the present invention typically has a moderately high to<br>
high glass transition point, e.g. up to about 210 °C, in particular 200 °C or less, preferably<br>
from about at least 30 or 60 up to 170 °C.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, the thermoplastic polymer is in particular selected from<br>
thermoplastic, biocompatible or biodegradable polymers derived from carbohydrate<br>
materials. This group of carbohydrate materials comprises native starch, dextrin, native<br>
hemicellulose, native cellulose as well as derivatives thereof, viz. starch derivatives,<br>
dextrin derivatives, hemicellulose derivatives, cellulose derivatives, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other suitable materials include poly(lactic acid), polylactides, polycaprolactone and<br>
similar "biopolymers", i.e. polymers produced from biologically available monomers<br>
which are or can be considered to be derived from carbohydrate materials.<br>
In order to convert the carbohydrate polymer into a thermoplastic polymer, the polymer<br>
material is plasticized. The plasticization can be effected by incorporating suitable<br>
substituents (internal plasticization) or by blending or melt-blending the native polymer<br>
with conventional ("external") plasticizers, typically monomeric plasticizers. It is also<br>
possible to combine these two approaches.<br>
As a specific example of the latter alternative, the working embodiment can be mentioned<br>
wherein the carbohydrate polymer is plasticized with a hydroxyl compound selected from<br>
the group of C2 to C4 alcohols having 1-5 hydroxyl groups, in particular glycerol or<br>
sorbitol or mixtures thereof. Other plasticizers are water, acetic glycerol esters, propylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, citric acid alkyl esters and mixtures thereof.<br>
Internally plasticized polymers, e.g. starch or cellulose derivatives, are generated from<br>
starch or cellulose by a chemical reaction, and at least part of the anhydroglucose units of<br>
the molecule comprises groups that modify the hydroxyl functions of said units.<br>
It should be noted that for some applications it is particularly preferred to use chemical<br>
derivatives of biopolymers. Thus, e.g. esterification (for instance acetylation) improves the<br>
thermal stability of the product, when compared with native starches. This is advantageous<br>
especially when the product is used as a pigment at an elevated temperature.<br>
The esters or ethers or mixed ester/ethers of starch are typically prepared from native<br>
starch, hydrolyzed starch, oxidized starch, cross-linked starch or gelatinized starch. The<br>
starch, in turn, can be based on any natural starch, the amylose content of which is 0-100<br>
% and the amylopectin content 100-0 %. Accordingly, the starch can be sourced from<br>
barley, potato, wheat, oats, pea, corn, tapioca, sago, and rice, or similar tuber vegetables<br>
and cereal crops.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the starch-based component is an ester formed of<br>
starch and one or several aliphatic C2-24 carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid residue of<br>
the ester can be derived from a lower alkane acid, such as acetic acid, propionic acid or<br>
butyric acid, or a mixture of them. According to a preferred embodiment, the starch<br>
component is an esterified starch, most suitably a starch acetate, the degree of substitution<br>
of which is 0.5-3, preferably 1.5-3 and most suitably 2-3. Suitable starch acetates are<br>
disclosed in, e.g. FI 113875, FI107386 and WO 05/037864.<br>
The starch ester can also be derived from natural saturated or unsaturated fatty acids.<br>
Examples of these are palmitinic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linolic acid, and mixtures of<br>
them. The ester may also comprise both long (C16-24) and short chain (C2-14) carboxylic<br>
acid components. An example of these is a mixed ester of acetate and stearate. Besides<br>
acids, corresponding acid anhydrides, and acid chlorides and other corresponding reactive<br>
acid derivatives, too, can be used to form esters in a way which is known per se.<br>
The production of fatty acid esters of starch can be carried out as described for instance in<br>
the following documents: Wolff, LA., Olds, D.W. and Hubert, G.E., The acylation of Com<br>
Starch, Amylose and Amylopectin, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 73 (1952) 346-349 or Gros, A.T.<br>
and Feuge, R.O., Properties of Fatty Acid Esters of Amylose, J. Amer. Oil Chemists' Soc<br>
39(1962)19-24.<br>
Lower ester derivatives, such as starch acetate, can be prepared by bringing the starch to<br>
react with an acid anhydride which corresponds to the ester group, for instance acetic<br>
anhydride, in the presence of a catalyst. Starch acetate can be produced for instance with<br>
the methods according to FI Patent No. 107386 or US Patent No. 5.667.803, or with other<br>
methods which are commonly used in acetylation of starch.<br>
Another important starch component of the invention is represented by an ether formed by<br>
starch and a hydroxy alkyl group, the hydroxy alkyl component of which is preferably<br>
derived from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. The molecular substitution of such an<br>
etherized starch is ca 0.05 - 6, preferably 0.1 - 3, in particular 0.3 - 2.<br>
Other suitable polymers include cellulose derivatives and hemicellulose derivatives, such<br>
as cellulose esters and xylan esters.<br>
As mentioned above, the starch component can be plasticized by blending it with a known<br>
softener, i.e. plasticizing agent. Thus, the composition according to the invention includes<br>
according to a preferred application in particular 0.01 - 50 wt-%, preferably ca 1 - 30 wt-<br>
% of plasticizer. Any of the above-mentioned plasticizers can be employed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic carbohydrate polymer is a<br>
hydrophobic starch ester having a degree of substitution of at least 1.7, in particular at least<br>
2.0. According to another preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic starch polymers are<br>
native starch, hydrolyzed starch and ether derivatives thereof or esters having a low DS or<br>
less than 0.5.<br>
The polymers can be applied on the surface in the form of particles or dispersions.<br>
A method for producing porous particles from starch-based raw-materials (for example<br>
starch esters or starch ethers) is described in our previous patents and patent applications<br>
(FI 20035172, FI 20035173, FI 20050833 and FI 20040741 (FI 118179)). In that method,<br>
the particles are prepared using a two-stage method in which the starch-based material is<br>
first dissolved in an organic solvent or a mixture of an organic solvent and a non-solvent,<br>
for instance water, from which mixture the starch component is subsequently precipitated<br>
by diluting the solution with a non-solvent. Said method generates essentially round,<br>
porous particles. These are suitable for example as fillers and pigments for paper. The<br>
derivatives are thermoplastic; Tg is typically approximately 150-160 °C. During<br>
calendering, the particle undergoes moulding, which makes the paper glossy.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the thermoplastic polymer is applied to the<br>
surface of the substrate in the form of particles of the above-indicated kind.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the thermoplastic polymer is applied to<br>
the surface of the substrate in the form of a dispersion. Dispersions of starch derivatives<br>
and other hydrophobic biopolymers can be produced for example as discussed in EP<br>
950074. In such a method, generally a mixture is formed from the hydrophobic<br>
biopolymer, a plasticizer, dispersion auxiliaries and water, the mixture is heated up in order<br>
to obtain a paste-like composition, and then the paste-like composition is diluted in water.<br>
A particularly interesting way of applying the material of the layer on a substrate is in the<br>
form of a coating colour, wherein the pigment is at least partially made up of starch<br>
pigments of the above kind. In that embodiment, the coating colour is mixed according to a<br>
basic recipe for offset or gravure printing, but at least a part of the conventional coating<br>
pigments are replaced with the instant pigments. Thus, preferably at least 20 (or at least<br>
even 25) wt-% of the dry matter of the coating colour is formed by the thermoplastic<br>
biopolymer of the present invention. The pigment of the coating colour preferably makes<br>
up at least 30 %, in particular at least 50 % up to 100 % of the pigment of the coating<br>
composition. The other pigments) can be any conventional pigment, usually an inorganic,<br>
mineral pigments, such as calcium carbonate (GCC and/or PCC), kaolin, talc, wollastonite,<br>
calcium sulphate and barium sulphate.<br>
The application of the thermoplastic polymer can be carried out in a manner known per se,<br>
e.g. by a conventional (blade) coater, a film press coater, a curtain coater or with a size<br>
press. In case of dispersions, the transferral of a continuous film onto the surface of the<br>
web typically requires that the dispersion contains at least some external plasticizer.<br>
After the application of the thermoplastic polymer on the substrate, water is evaporated<br>
from the layer of the coating colour. The layer is dried and hardened to the extent that it is<br>
possible by heat-treatment (over at least 50 °C) and increased pressure to achieve<br>
permanent diffraction patterns.<br>
It should be pointed out that it is not necessary to provide the substrate with an integral<br>
layer which covers the whole substrate. For the purpose of the invention it is sufficient that<br>
the layer is present at the point where the embossing is carried out. Thus the thermoplastic<br>
carbohydrate polymer need only cover the part of the substrate where the barcode tag or<br>
safety marking or identification label is applied.<br>
The substrate fibrous material is selected from cellulosic, lignocellulosic and thermoplastic<br>
fibres and mixtures thereof. Typically, the substrate comprises a web or sheet of paper or<br>
cardboard or a layer formed by natural fibres, such as cotton. It may comprise a base paper<br>
or cardboard, which optionally contains filler(s). The grammage can vary freely but is<br>
usually in the range of about 30 to 750 g/m2, for example about 40 to 500 g/m2, and the<br>
thickness is about 1 to 100 micrometres.<br>
Summarizing, a method of producing a microstructure of the above kind, comprises<br>
- forming a layer of a thermoplastic carbohydrate polymer having a glass transition<br>
point of less than 210 °C, in particular less than about 170 °C; and<br>
- embossing into the layer a diffractive microstructure comprising micro-protrusions<br>
or microgrooves or a combination thereof.<br>
The layer is preferably embossed at a temperature of at least 100 °C and a pressure of 1.5<br>
bar (abs.) or more.<br>
The layer is formed on a substrate by depositing it from an aqueous slurry, and the layer<br>
deposited on the substrate is allowed to dry before embossing.<br>
According to one embodiment, the layer is smoothened to a roughness of 5 ppm at most,<br>
preferably 3 ppm or less before embossing. The smoothening can be achieved with<br>
conventional calendaring, which can be carried out either on-machine or off-machine or by<br>
a combination thereof. Examples of suitable calenders include soft calenders, calenders<br>
with expended nips, thermocalenders and supercalenders to mention a few.<br>
According to another embodiment, there is no need for smoothening of the surface before<br>
embossing. It has been found that for certain coating composition which are rich (over 50<br>
% by weight with respect to) in starch pigment, the surface smoothness does not appear to<br>
have any significant influence on the hot-embossing.<br>
In practice, embossing can be carried out as known in the art. We refer to the art mentioned<br>
above in the general part of the description. Thus, the layer can be embossed using an<br>
embossing device comprising an embossing device and a backing member and further<br>
comprising means for adjusting the temperature of the embossing device.<br>
The embossing device can be static or dynamic, as will be discussed below in connection<br>
with the examples. In case of dynamic embossing, the embossing member is placed on a<br>
roll. Typical, roll-on-roll embossing requires that there is an embossing device comprising<br>
in combination an embossing roll and a backing roll for exerting embossing pressure on the<br>
surface layer of a substrate which is pressed between the rolls.<br>
Flat-bed embossing is done using embossing means, which comprise at least one<br>
embossing plate. The working surface of the plate can be, for example, of metal having a<br>
microfabricated negative of the desired embossing.<br>
Generally, in both static and dynamic embossing, the embossing member used for<br>
achieving the desired pattern has a structure corresponding to the diffractive microstructure<br>
which is to be produced. It can be made on a thin metal sheet, in particular a thin nickel<br>
sheet, by, for instance, optical exposure combined with electrochemical deposition or by<br>
electron lithography. An embossing member also known as a shim is thus obtained and by<br>
using this shim, the desired diffractive microstructures is produced by pressing the shim<br>
onto the surface of the thermoplastic layer.<br>
To achieve the shaping action, the surface needs to be soft, which can be obtained by<br>
increasing the temperature of the layer to about or above the glass transition point of the<br>
polymer.<br>
The embossed products, sheets and webs, produced according to the present invention can<br>
be employed, for example, in the packaging industry to give the product a safety-marking<br>
for warranting the authenticity of the product or for graphically enriching the exterior<br>
decorative image of the packages. Examples of typically applications are daily consumer<br>
goods, cigarettes, digital media, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and consumer electronics,<br>
including fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and food products.<br>
It is highly advantageous for the package converter, product packager or brand owner that<br>
the microstructure can be applied to the surface during the processing, e.g. during last or<br>
penultimate step of the converting process, before or even during cutting, since this will do<br>
away with the need for further separate marking steps.<br>
The following non-limiting working examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Coating of base paper with coating colour containing modified starch pigments<br>
LWC -base paper was coated with a one side laboratory coater (CLC-600) with following<br>
coating colour formulations presented in table 1. The coating pigments used in the<br>
formulations were clay, ground calcium carbonate and experimental modified starch based<br>
pigment developed at VTT .<br>
The samples were calandered three passes at 500 kN/m2 with a laboratory calander, tested<br>
for paper technical and surface properties and printed with a four-color offset press. The<br>
uncalandered sample of coating color 16 was not printed and it is marked with ctg#16.<br>
Selected calandered and printed samples and uncalandered sample ctg#16 were hot-<br>
embossed.<br>
Example 2<br>
The aim of this task was to the test embossability of the paper samples, which were coated<br>
with coatings containing different amounts of starch based pigment. The amount of coating<br>
was about 7g/m2 for each sample.. Sample ctg#16 was uncalendared .<br>
Procedure<br>
Coated paper samples containing 100, 50 or 0 parts of modified starch pigments in the<br>
conting (Example 1) were embossed using a static embosser. During these embossing tests<br>
only the hot-embossing temperature was varied from 70 to 145 °C. The hot-embossing<br>
pressure and stamping time were kept constant; stamping time was 5 seconds and pressure<br>
6 bars. The suitable temperature for good embossing quality is shown in Table 2.<br>
The hot-embossing temperature scale for all samples, are relatively large. Based on the<br>
above date, a person skilled in the art can easily adapt the static process to continuous<br>
embossing using, e.g., a roll-to-roll embossing machine:<br>
According to the tests the best sample based on visual estimation was calandered sample<br>
16. The best results were obtained when the temperature of 130 °C and pressure of 5 bars<br>
for 5 s of embossing was used.<br>
The results with noncalendared sample (ctg#16) were also surprisingly good, almost at the<br>
same level as for the calendered sample. It was noticed that the brightness of the<br>
noncalendared sample became better when higher embossing temperature was used.<br>
The suitable hot-embossing temperature range with sample 13b, and 15 were narrower<br>
than for the other samples. This was maybe caused by the lower content of the starch<br>
pigment amount in the coating and combination of effects of starch based and mineral<br>
pigments.<br>
The weakest embossing effects could be seen on samples 17 and 18 which were coated<br>
with coating colors containing only mineral pigments.<br>
