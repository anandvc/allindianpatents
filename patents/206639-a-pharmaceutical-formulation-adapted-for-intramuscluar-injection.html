COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A	PHARMACEUTICAL	FORMULATION	ADAPTED	FOR<br>
INTRAMUSCLUAR INJECTION"<br>
AstraZeneca AB, of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
26 JUL2005<br><br><br>
'<br><br>
The invention relates to a novel sustained release pharmaceutical formulation adapted for administration by injection containing the compound<br>
7a-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)nonyljoestra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3,17p-dioI, more particularly to a formulation adapted for administration by injection containing the compound 7a-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)nonyl]oestra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3,17p-diolin solution in a ricinoleate vehicle which additionally comprises at least one alcohol and a non¬aqueous ester solvent which is miscible in the ricinoleate vehicle.<br>
Oestrogen deprivation is fundamental to the treatment of many benign and malignant diseases of the breast and reproductive tract. In premenopausal women, this is achieved by the ablation of ovarian function through surgical, radiotherapeutic, or medical means, arid, in postmenopausal women, by the use of aromatase inhibitors.<br>
An alternative approach to oestrogen withdrawal is to antagonise oestrogens with antioestrogens. These are drugs that bind to and compete for oestrogen receptors (ER) present in the nuclei of oestrogen-responsive tissue. Conventional nonsteroidal antioestrogens, such as tamoxifen, compete efficiently for ER binding but their effectiveness is often limited by the partial agonism they display, which results in an incomplete blockade of oestrogen-mediated activity (Furr and Jordan 1984, May and Westley 1987).<br>
The potential for nonsteroidal antioestrogens to display agbnistic properties prompted the search for novel compounds that would bind ER with high affinity without activating any of the normal transcriptional hormone responses and consequent manifestations of oestrogens. Such molecules would be "pure" antioestrogens, clearly distinguished from tamoxifen-like ligands and capable of eliciting complete ablation of the trophic effects of oestrogens. Such !   compounds are referred to as Estrogen Receptor-Downregulators (E.RD.). The rationale for the design and testing of novel, pure antioestrogens has been described in: Bowler et al 1989, Wakeling 1990a, 1990b, 1990c. Wakeling and Bowler 1987, 1988.<br>
Steroidal analogues of oestradiol, with an alkylsulphinyl side chain in the 7a position, provided the first examples of compounds devoid of oestrogenic activity (Bowler et al 1989). One of these, 7o&gt;[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafiuoropentyI suiphinyl)nonyijoestra-l,3,5-(10)triene-3,17p-dioI was selected for intensive study on the basis of its pure oestrogen antagonist activity and significantly increased antiestrogenic potency over other available<br>
2<br><br>
" antioestrogens. In vitro findings and early clinical experience with<br>
7a-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)nonyl]oestra-l,3-5(10)-triene-3,17p-diolhave<br>
promoted interest in the development of the drug as a therapeutic agent for oestrogen-<br>
dependent indications such as breast cancer and certain benign gynaecological conditions.<br>
;"	7a-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)nonyl]oestra-l ,3-5(10)-triene-3,17p-diol,<br>
or ICI 182,780, has been allocated the international non-proprietary name fulvestrant, which is used hereinafter. When referring to fulvestrant we include pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof and any possible solvates of either thereof.<br>
Fulvestrant binds to ER with an affinity similar to that of oestradiol and completely blocks the growth stimulatory action of oestradiol on human breast cancer cells in vitro; it is more potent and more effective than tamoxifen in this respect. Fulvestrant blocks completely the uterotrophic action of oestradiol in rats, mice and monkeys, and also blocks the uterotrophic activity of tamoxifen.<br>
Because fulvestrant has none of the oestrogen-like stimulatory activity that is characteristic of clinically available antioestrogens such as tamoxifen or toremifene, it may offer improved therapeutic activity characterised by more rapid, complete, or longer-lasting tumour regression; a lower incidence or rate of development of resistance to treatment; and a reduction of tumour invasiveness.<br>
In intact adult rats, fulvestrant achieves maximum regression of the uterus at a dose which does not adversely affect bone density or lead to increased gonadotrophin secretion. If also true in humans,'these findings could be of extreme importance clinically. Reduced bone density limits the duration of oestrogen-ablative treatment for endometriosis. Fulvestrant does not block hypothalamic ER. Oestrogen ablation also causes or exacerbates hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms; fulvestrant will not cause such effects because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier.<br>
European Patent Application No. 0 138 504 discloses that certain steroid derivatives are effective antioestrogenic agents. The disclosure includes information relating to the preparation of the steroid derivatives. In particular there is the disclosure within Example 35 of the compound 7a-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyI)nonyI]oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17p-diol, which compound is specifically named in Claim 4. It is also disclosed that the compounds of that invention may be provided for use in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a steroid derivative of the invention together with a<br>
3<br><br>
'pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier. It is stated therein that the composition can be in a form suitable for oral or parenteral administration.<br>
Fulvestrant shows, along with other steroidal based compounds, certain physical properties which make formulation of these compounds difficult. Fulvestrant is a particularly lipophilic molecule, even when compared with other steroidal compounds, and its aqueous solubility is extremely low at around 10 ngml"1 (this is an estimate from a water/solvent mixture solute since measurements this low could not be achieved in a water only solute). Currently there are a number of sustained release injectable steroidal formulations which have been commercialised.   Commonly these formulations use oil as a solvent and wherein additional excipients may be present. Below in Table 1 are described a few commercialised sustained release injectable formulations.<br>
In the formulations within Table 1 a number of different oils are used to solubilise the compound and additional excipients such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol and ethanol have been used. Volumes of oil needed to solubilise the steroid active ingredient are low. Extended release is achievable for periods from 1 to 8 weeks.<br>

In US 5,183,814 Example 3 an oil based injection formulation of fulvestrant is described which comprises 50mg of fulvestrant, 400mg of benzyl alcohol and sufficient castor .oil to bring the solution to a volume of 1 ml. Manufacture at a commercial scale of a formulation as described in US 5,183,814 will be complicated by the high alcohol concentration. Therefore, there is a need to lower the alcohol concentration in fulvestrant formulations whilst preventing precipitation of fulvestrant from the formulation.<br>

As can be seen fulvestrant is significantly more soluble in castor oil than any of the other oils tested. The greater solvating ability of castor oil for steroidal compounds is known and is attributed to the high number of hydroxy groups of ricinoleic acid, which is the major constituent of the fatty acids within the triglycerides present in castor oil - see (Riffkin et.al. J. Pharm. Sci., (1964), 53, 891).<br>
However, even when using the best oil based solvent, castor oil, we have found that it is not possible to dissolve fulvestrant in an oil based solvent alone so as to achieve a high<br>
7<br><br>
enough concentration to dose a patient in a low volume injection and achieve a therapeutically significant release rate. To achieve a therapeutically significant release rate the amount of fulvestrant needed would require the formulation volume to be large, at least 10 ml. This requires the doctor to inject an excessively large volume of formulation to administer a dose significantly high enough for human therapy.<br>
Currently guidelines recommend that no more than 5mls of liquid is injected intramuscularly in a single injection. Pharmacologically active doses required for a 1 month long acting depot formulation of fulvestrant is around 250mg. Therefore, when dissolved in just castor oil, fulvestrant would need to be administered in at least 10ml of castor oil.<br>
The addition of organic solvents in which fulvestrant is freely soluble, and which are miscible with castor oil, may be used, such as an alcohol. With the addition of high concentrations of an alcohol concentrations of &gt;50mgml"!. of fulvestrant in a castor'oil formulation is achievable, thereby giving an injection volumes of 
Therefore, we present as a feature of the invention a pharmaceutical formulation comprising fulvestrant (preferably fulvestrant is present at 3-10%w/v, 4-9%w/v, 4-8%w/v, 4-7%w/v, 4-6%w/v and most preferably at about 5%w/v) in a ricinoleate vehicle, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous ester solvent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable alcohol wherein the formulation is adapted for intramuscular administration and attaining a therapeutically significant blood plasma fulvestrant concentration for at least 2 weeks.<br>

The ricinoleate vehicle may be a synthetic oil or conveniently is castor oil, ideally of pharmacopoeial standards, as described above.<br>
We have surprisingly found that the above formulations of the invention provide, after intra-muscular injection, satisfactory release of fulvestrant over an extended period of time.<br>
This finding is indeed surprising for the following reasons. 1.        Previously tested by the applicants have been intra-muscular injections of fulvestrant in the form of an aqueous suspension. We have found extensive local tissue irritation at the injection site as well as a poor release profile. It is believed that the tissue irritation/inflammation was due to the presence of fulvestrant in the form of solid particles. The release profile appeared to be determined by the extent of inflammation/irritation present at the injection site and this was variable and difficult to control. Also the fulvestrant release rate was not sufficiently high to be clinically significant.<br>
14<br>
2.	Our findings from studies using   C labelled benzyl alcohol show that it dissipates<br>
rapidly from the injection site and is removed from the body within 24 hours of administration.<br>
It would be expected that ethanol will dissipate at least as quickly, if not more "rapidly, from the injection site.<br>
12<br><br>
-<br>
It is known that benzyl benzoate is metabolised by conjugation to glycine to form hippuric acid by the human liver and excreted into the urine - Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia 32nd edition page 1103, and, therefore, it is unlikely that benzyl benzoate, when used, is present at the injection site during the whole of the extended release period.<br>
We have found that despite the rapid elimination of the additional solubilising excipients, i.e. the alcohol and pharmaceutically-acceptable non-aqueous ester solvent, from the formulation vehicle and the site of injection after injection of the formulation, extended release at therapeutically significant levels of fiilvestrant over an extended period can still achieved by the formulation of the invention.<br>
By use of the term "therapeutically significant levels" we mean that blood plasma concentrations of at least 2.5 ngml"1, ideally at least 3 ngml"1, at least 8.5 ngml"1, and up to 12 ngml"1 of fiilvestrant are achieved in the patient. Preferably blood plasma levels should be less than 15 ngml!.<br>
By use of the term "extended release" we mean at least two weeks, at least three weeks, and, preferably at least four weeks of continuous release of fiilvestrant is achieved. In a preferred feature extended release is achieved for 36 days. Preferably extended release of fiilvestrant is for at least 2- 5 weeks and more preferably for the following periods (weeks) 2.5-5,2.5-4, 3-4, 3.5-4 and most preferably for at least about 4 weeks.<br>
It will be understood that the attendant physician may wish to administer the intramuscular injection as a divided dose, i.e. a 5ml formulation is sequentially administered in two separate injections of 2.5ml, this is a further feature of the invention<br>
Simply solubilising fiilvestrant in an oil based liquid formulation is not predictive of a good release profile or lack of precipitation of drug after injection at the injection site.<br>
Table 3 shows the solubility of fiilvestrant in a castor oil vehicle additionally containing alcohols ethanol and benzyl alcohol with or without benzyl benzoate. The results clearly show the positive effect of benzyl benzoate on fiilvestrant solubility in castor oil, despite fiilvestrant having a lower solubility in benzyl benzoate than in either alcohol or castor oil.<br>

Precipitation of fulvestrant and the release profile was determined with the above formulations in an in vivo rabbit study.<br>
Figure 1 shows the release profile in vivo of the four formulations from the second part ' of Table 4 and shows the effect of the fixed oil component on fulvestrant plasma profile over five days following intramuscular administration in rabbits (data normalised to 50mg per 3kg; mean given; number of animals per timepoint = 8, plasma samples assayed for fulvestrant content using lc-ms/ms detection following solvent extraction). As can be seen the castor oil formulation showed a particularly even release profile with no evidence of precipitation of fulvestrant at the injection site.<br>
Therefore we present as a further feature of the invention an extended release pharmaceutical formulation adapted for intramuscular injection comprising fulvestrant; 35% (preferably 30% or ideally 25%) or less weight of a pharmaceutically-acceptable alcohol per volume of formulation, at least 1% (preferably at least 5% or ideally 10%) weight of a pharmaceutically-acceptable non-aqueous ester solvent miscible in a ricinoleate vehicle per volume of formulation and sufficient amount of a ricinoleate vehicle, taking into account the addition of any further optional pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients, so as to prepare a formulation of at least 45mgml"'of fulvestrant.<br>
A further feature of the invention is a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for intramuscular injection, as defined above, for use in medical therapy.<br>
A further feature of the invention is a method of treating a benign or malignant diseases of the breast or reproductive tract, preferably treating breast cancer, by administration to a human in need of such treatment by intramuscular injection an extended release ricinoleate vehicle based pharmaceutical formulation comprising at least 45mgml"' of fulvestrant; 35% (preferably 30% or ideally 25%) or less weight of a pharmaceutically-acceptable alcohol per volume of formulation, at least 1% (preferably at least 5% or ideally 10%) weight of a pharmaceutically-acceptable non-aqueous ester solvent miscible in a ricinoleate vehicle per volume of formulation.<br>
Preferably 5ml of the intramuscular injection is administered. A further feature of the invention is use of fulvestrant in the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation as describe hereinabove, for the treatment of a benign or malignant disease of the breast or reproductive tract, preferably treating breast cancer.<br>
16<br><br>
■ - \6~-<br>
Additional excipients commonly used in the formulation field including, for example, an antioxidant preservative, a colorant or a surfactant may be used. A preferred optional excipient is a surfactant.<br>
As described above fulvestrant is useful in the treatment of oestrogen-dependent indications such as breast cancer and gynaecological conditions, such as endometriosis.<br>
In addition to fulvestrant another similar type of molecule is currently under clinical investigation. SH-646 (1 lp-fluoro- 7a-(14,14,15,15,15-pentafluoro-6-methyl-10-thia-6-azapentadecyI)estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3,17p-diol) is also putatively a compound with the same mode of action as fulvestrant and has a very similar chemical structure. It is believed that the compound will also share with fulvestrant similar physical properties and therefore the current invention will also have application with this compound. A further feature of the invention is a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for intra-rnuscular injection comprising 1 lp-fluoro- 7a-(14,14,15,15,15-pentafluoro-6-methyl-10-thia-6-azapentadecyI)estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3,173-diol; 35% or less weight of a pharmaceutically-acceptable alcohol per volume of formulation, at least 1% weight of a pharmaceutically-acceptable non-aqueous ester solvent miscible within a ricinoleate vehicle per volume of formulation and a sufficient amount of a ricinoleate vehicle so as to prepare a formulation of at least 45mgml;' of 1 ip-fluoro- 7ot-(14,14,15,15,15-pentafluoro-6-methyl-10-thia-6-azapentadecyl)estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17p-diol.<br>
Further features of the invention are those as described above but in which SH-646 is substituted for fulvestrant.<br>
Formulation Example<br>
Fulvestrant is mixed with alcohol and benzyl alcohol, stirring until completely dissolved. Benzyl benzoate is added and the solution is made to final weight with castor oil and stirred, (for convenience weight is used rather than volume by using the weight to volume ratio). The bulk solution is overlaid with Nitrogen. The solution is sterilised by filtration using one or two filters of 0.2u.m porosity. The sterile filtrate is kept under a nitrogen overlay as it is filled under aseptic conditions into washed and depyrogenised, sterile primary containers, for example vials or pre-filled syringes. An overage is included in the primary<br>
17<br><br>
-    pack to facilitate removal of the dose volume. The primary packs are overlaid with sterile nitrogen, before aseptically sealing.<br>

Quantities of each component of the formulation is chosen according to the required formulation specification, examples are described above. For example quantities are added of each component to prepare a formulation which contains 10% weight per volume of benzyl alcohol 10% weight per volume of ethanol i    15% weight per volume of benzyl benzoate<br>
250mg of fulvestrant for each 5ml of finished formulation and the remaining amount as castor oil<br>
