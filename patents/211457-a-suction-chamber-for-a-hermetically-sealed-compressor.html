AN IMPROVED HAND PUMP FOR LIFTING WATER OR THE LIKE<br>
LIQUID<br>
PURODA KHERAJBHAI GOVINDBAI, C/o. Hariom Welding Works, Mota Mava Kalvad Road, Rajkot- 360 005. Indian National.<br>
The    following    specification particularly    describes    the nature of the invention and the manner   in which   it is to be performed.<br>
 1  APR 2006<br><br>
This invention relates to an improved hand pump for lifting water or the like liquid.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to an improved hand pump for lifting under ground water or any liquid from lower level to higher level in which improvement mainly lies in the mechanism used for moving the piston-cylinder assembly, to and fro or up and down, in order to reduce the manual force required for pump operation.<br>
Hand pump is a well-known device mainly used for lifting under ground water in rural or semi urban areas. The existing hand pump for lifting water mainly comprises a pump body with a water outlet spout, fixed above the ground over a casing pipe, which extends into the ground upto the water strata. A piston - cylinder assembly is provided inside the pump body, if water level is less than about 30 feet or inside the casing pipe where water level is more than 30 feet deep. The said cylinder-piston assembly is connected to a piston / connecting rod which extends through the pump body and pivotally linked to a handle. The handle works as a lever arm having its fulcrum at the pivot pin or bolt used for connecting the piston/connecting rod with the handle. The hand pump works on the well known principle of vacuum and for creating vacuum inside the casing pipe for lifting up the under ground water as well as for pushing out the water through the spout in the pump body the said piston cylinder assembly is required to be moved up and down in the reciprocating manner and for which manual force is applied at the free end of the pump handle.<br>
Due to the above-described mechanism the water lifting job by the hand pump is very hard, tiring and a person gets completely exhausted in a very short time. In rural areas due to big families water requirement is very large, beside family members, water is required for the cattle, and therefore pump is required to be operated for a longer time every day.   Further due to low<br>
2<br><br>
income in rural areas, nutritious diet or healthy food is not available and the people are not strong and healthy. Under such circumstances the lifting of water with the existing hand pump proves to be a very difficult. Sometimes children are also deputed for operating the hand pump and in the absence of good food their health is affected adversely.<br>
In urban or semi urban areas where electricity is available, an electric motor with gear and cam arrangement, for converting high rotations of the motor into slow reciprocating motion of the piston connecting rod is provided with the hand pump. In this arrangement besides a high initial cost involvement, a high operating cost of electricity consumption as well as cost of repeated maintenance of motor, gear and cam is required. Further in case of electric supply failure or power cut, which is very common in our country, water pump becomes inoperative. Therefore it is noticed that a very large number of hand pumps are still manually operated.<br>
Some efforts have been made to reduce the manual force requirement for operating the pump, by improving the handle and the piston connecting rod linking arrangement, but such efforts are not satisfactory and have failed to reduce significantly the manual force required for operating the pump.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide an improved hand pump for lifting water or the like liquid, in which the handle and the connecting rod linking arrangement is improved or say provided with a novel mechanism in order to reduce the manual force required for operating the hand pump tremendously.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved hand pump, which can be used for lifting water even in the areas where under ground water level is very low and where the existing water hand pumps cannot be used due to very high manual force requirement. A further object of this invention<br>
3<br><br>
is to provide an improved hand pump which does not require very high initial investment, like electric motor with gear and cam, and in which operating cost is nil and the maintenance cost is also almost nil.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an improved hand pump, which can be operated even by children or people with poor health, without affecting them adversely.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an improved hand pump, the operation of which does not depend on any supply like electricity and which is ready to use easily at any time and anywhere.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides an improved hand pump, for lifting water or the like liquid, comprising a pump body with an outlet spout, mounted on a foundation at the ground surrounding abasing pipe, a piston-cylinder assembly provided inside the said casing pipe adapted for moving up and down in the reciprocating manner for lifting and delivering water/liquid through the said spout, a piston/connecting rod, connected to the piston of the said piston-cylinder assembly and extended through the said casing pipe and the said pump body, a top flange provided at the top of the pump body, a pump head and stand assembly mounted on the said top flange, a chain connected to the top end of the said piston/connecting rod, the said chain passing through a chain guide means consisting of a substantially half round chain gallery formed by pair of substantially half, round plates, the free end of the said chain fixed to the said half round plates, a handle fixed to the said half round plates with the help of a pair of bushes and bearings assembly provided with a bearing axle.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
4<br><br>
FIG.l - Shows in elevation an improved hand pump, according to this invention, along with under ground casing pipe.<br>
FIG.2- shows in sectional elevation the details of improved hand pump, shown in Fig.l.<br>
FIGS. 3,4,5 &amp; 6 - Shows the details of Piston/Connecting rod moving mechanism, according to an embodiment of this invention. FIGS. 7 &amp; 8 - Show the details of Piston/Connecting rod moving mechanism according to another embodiment of this invention.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 8, an improved hand pump (1) for lifting water and the like liquid, according to this invention, mainly comprises a pump body (2) provided with an outlet spout (3) a foundation flange (4) for mounting the pump body on the foundation (5) at the ground surrounding a casing pipe (6) which is immersed in the ground by boring operation, upto a suitable water strata. Inside the casing pipe, a piston-cylinder assembly (7) is provided which moves up and down for creating vacuum and lifting ground water which is pushed out through the spout (3) in a known manner. For moving the piston-cylinder assembly up and down in a reciprocating manner the piston is connected to a piston rod or connecting rod (8) which passes through the casing pipe (6) and pump body (2). The pump body (2) is provided with a bottom flange (9), below the spout (3) and a top flange (10) at the top of pump body (2). The pump body (2), below the bottom flange (9) is termed as standpipe and above it as tank pipe forming water chamber. The bottom flange (9) is also provided with a riser pipe holder (11), for holding a riser pipe (not shown) as and when required.<br>
The top flange (10) is also provided with a piston rod guide bush (12) for guiding and supporting the piston/connecting rod and allowing the same to move up and down vertically, without allowing any horizontal movement. Over the top flange (10) a pump head and stand assembly (13) is provided. The improvement of hand pump according to this invention lies in the mechanism for moving the piston rod (8) i.e. the means for connecting the<br>
5<br><br>
top end of the piston rod (8) to a handle (14) through a chain (15). The chain (15) is having a coupling (16) inside which the top end (17) of the piston rod (8) is inserted and held tightly with the help of a fastening means such as bolt (18). The chain (15) after connecting with the piston rod passes over a substantially half round flange (19), provided in a chain gallery formed by a pair of substantially half round plates (20), placed inside pump head (13) in a space apart relationship-according to the size of the chain. The other free end (21) of the chain (15) is connected to the half round flange (19) with the help of fastening means such as bolt (22) passing through a hole in the flange (19) and plates (20). The handle (14) is connected to the half round flange (19) by using a pair of bushes (23) and ball bearings (24) assembly mounted on a bearing axle (25). As an alternative, according to another embodiment of this invention, instead of a half round flange (19) and pair of plates (20) forming chain gallery, a chain sprocket (26) is provided inside the pump head assembly (13) and the handle (14) are connected to the sprocket (26) by using a pair of bushes (23) and ball bearings (24) assembly mounted on a bearing axle (25) as described above. The chain (15) passes over and engages with teeth (27) and fixed to the handle or the sprocket by using a screw (28) or the like means. The chain is connected to the piston rod (8) in the same manner as described in the first embodiment.<br>
The handle being connected to a half round plate or sprocket over which chain is passed and moved, through a bearing axle passing through a pair of bushes and ball bearings, the manual force applied at the free end of the handle is very much less in comparison with traditional hand pumps. Further the connection of chain with the piston rod which passes through a bush provided in the top flange of the pump body minimizes the sideward movement, which further reduces the force to be applied for piston movement as well as bear and tear and therefore the maintenance of the pump is brought down to a minimum.<br>
