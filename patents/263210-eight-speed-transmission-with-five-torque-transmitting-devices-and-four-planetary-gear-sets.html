MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/895,411, filed on March 16, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0002] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of a<br>
plurality of torque transmitting mechanisms, planetary gear arrangements and<br>
fixed interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and<br>
physical arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by<br>
packaging, cost and desired speed ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
[0003] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A transmission is provided having an input member, an output<br>
member, a plurality of planetary gear sets, and a plurality of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms. The plurality of planetary gear sets each have a sun gear member,<br>
a planetary carrier member, and a ring gear member.<br>
[0005] In one aspect of the present invention, four of the gear sets are<br>
simple planetary gear sets.<br>
[0006] In another aspect of the present invention, two of the plurality of<br>
torque transmitting mechanisms are brakes.<br>
[0007] In another aspect of the present invention, three of the torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms are friction clutches.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 1A, an embodiment of a multi-speed or<br>
eight speed transmission is generally indicated by reference number 10. The<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated as a rear-wheel drive or longitudinal transmission,<br>
though various other types of transmission configurations may be employed.<br>
The transmission 10 includes a transmission housing 11, an input shaft or<br>
member 12, and an output shaft or member 14. The input member 12 is<br>
continuously connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque<br>
4<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
converter (not shown). The output member 14 is continuously connected with a<br>
final drive unit (not shown) or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0028] The transmission 10 includes a first planetary gear set 16, a<br>
second planetary gear set 18, a third planetary gear set 20, and a fourth<br>
planetary gear set 22. The planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20 and 22 are connected<br>
between the input member 12 and the output member 14. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the planetary gear set 16 includes a sun<br>
gear member 24, a ring gear member 26, and a planet carrier member 28 that<br>
rotatably supports a set of planet or pinion gears 30 (only one of which is shown).<br>
The pinion gears 30 are configured to intermesh with the sun gear member 24<br>
and the ring gear member 26. The sun gear member 24 is connected for<br>
common rotation with a first shaft or intermediate member 32 and a second shaft<br>
or intermediate member 34. It should be appreciated that the first intermediate<br>
member 32 is connected for common rotation with the second intermediate<br>
member 34 and that the intermediate members 32 and 34 may form one single<br>
shaft or multiple shafts through one or more members of the planetary gear sets,<br>
as seen throughout the several views. The ring gear member 26 is connected for<br>
common rotation with a third shaft or intermediate member 36. The planet carrier<br>
member 28 is connected for common rotation with a fourth shaft or intermediate<br>
member 38.<br>
[0029] The planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 42, a<br>
ring gear member 44, and a planet carrier member 46 that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet or pinion gears 48. The pinion gears 48 are configured to intermesh<br>
5<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
with the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear member 44. The sun gear<br>
member 42 is connected for common rotation with the second intermediate<br>
member 34. The ring gear member 44 is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fifth shaft or intermediate member 50. The planet carrier member 46 is<br>
connected for common rotation with the input member 12.<br>
[0030] The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 52, a<br>
ring gear member 54, and a carrier member 56 that rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet or pinion gears 58. The pinion gears 58 are configured to intermesh with<br>
the sun gear member 52 and the ring gear member 54. The sun gear member<br>
52 is connected for common rotation with the fifth shaft or intermediate member<br>
50 and with a sixth shaft or intermediate member 51. It should be appreciated<br>
that the fifth intermediate member 50 is connected for common rotation with the<br>
sixth intermediate member 51 and that the intermediate members 50 and 51 may<br>
form one single shaft or multiple shafts through one or more members of the<br>
planetary gear sets, as seen throughout the several views. The ring gear<br>
member 54 is connected for common rotation with a seventh shaft or<br>
intermediate member 60. The planet carrier member 56 is connected for<br>
common rotation with an eighth shaft or intermediate member 62. It should be<br>
appreciated that the eighth intermediate member 62 is connected for common<br>
rotation with the output member 14 and that the eighth intermediate members 62<br>
and the output member 14 may form one single shaft or multiple shafts through<br>
one or more members of the planetary gear sets, as seen throughout the several<br>
views.<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
[0031] The planetary gear set 22 includes a sun gear member 72, a<br>
ring gear member 74, and a planet carrier member 76 that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet or pinion gears 78. The pinion gears 78 are configured to intermesh<br>
with the sun gear member 72 and the ring gear member 74. The sun gear<br>
member 72 is connected for common rotation with a ninth shaft or intermediate<br>
member 64 and a tenth shaft or intermediate member 66. It should be<br>
appreciated that the ninth intermediate member 64 is connected for common<br>
rotation with the tenth intermediate member 66 and that the intermediate<br>
members 64 and 66 may form one single shaft or multiple shafts through one or<br>
more members of the planetary gear sets, as seen throughout the several views.<br>
The ring gear member 74 is connected for common rotation with the fourth<br>
intermediate member 38. The planet carrier member 76 is connected for<br>
common rotation with the output member 14 and with the eighth intermediate<br>
member 62.<br>
[0032] The transmission 10 includes a variety of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms or devices including a first intermediate clutch C1, a second<br>
intermediate clutch C2, a third intermediate clutch C3, a first brake B1 and a<br>
second brake B2. The first intermediate clutch C1 is selectively engagable to<br>
connect the input member 12 to the tenth intermediate member 66. Alternatively,<br>
the first intermediate clutch C1 may be connected to the input member 12<br>
through the planet carrier member 46, as seen throughout the several views.<br>
The second intermediate clutch C2 is selectively engagable to connect the sixth<br>
intermediate member 51 to the ninth intermediate member 64. The third<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
intermediate clutch C3 is selectively engagable to connect the seventh<br>
intermediate member 60 to the ninth intermediate member 64. The brake B1 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the first intermediate member 32 to the<br>
transmission housing 11 to restrict rotation of the first intermediate member 32<br>
relative to the transmission housing 11. Finally, the brake B2 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the third intermediate member 36 to the transmission<br>
housing 11 to restrict rotation of the third intermediate member 36 relative to the<br>
transmission housing 11.<br>
[0033] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input member 12 to the output member 14 in at least eight forward torque ratios<br>
and one reverse torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse<br>
torque ratio are attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms (i.e. first intermediate clutch C1, second intermediate clutch C2,<br>
third intermediate clutch C3, brake B1 and brake B2). Those skilled in the art<br>
will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque<br>
ratio. Thus, eight forward speed ratios may be attained by the transmission 10.<br>
[0034] The transmission housing 11 includes a first end wall 102, a<br>
second end wall 104, and a third wall 106. The third wall 106 interconnects<br>
between the first and second end walls 102 and 104 to provide a space or cavity<br>
108 in which planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22 and the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 are located. Further, the cavity 108 has a<br>
plurality of areas or Zones A, B, C, D, E, and F in which the plurality of torque<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
transmitting mechanisms C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 will be specifically positioned,<br>
in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0035] As shown in FIG. 1A and throughout the several views, Zone A<br>
is defined by the area or space bounded: axially on the left by the first end wall<br>
102, on the right by planetary gear set 16, radially inward by a reference line "L"<br>
which is a longitudinal line that is axially aligned with the input shaft 12, and<br>
radially outward by a reference line "M" which is a longitudinal line that extends<br>
adjacent an outer diameter or outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 16, 18,<br>
20, and 22. While reference line "M" is illustrated as a straight line throughout<br>
the several views, it should be appreciated that reference line "M" follows the<br>
outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22, and accordingly<br>
may be stepped or non-linear depending on the location of the outer periphery of<br>
each of the planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22. Zone B is defined by the<br>
area bounded: axially on the left by planetary gear set 16, axially on the right by<br>
the planetary gear set 18, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially<br>
inward by reference line "L". Zone C is defined by the area bounded: axially on<br>
the left by the planetary gear set 18, axially on the right by the planetary gear set<br>
20, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line<br>
"L". Zone D is defined by the area bounded: axially on the left by the planetary<br>
gear set 20, axially on the right by the planetary gear set 22, radially outward by<br>
reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone E is defined by<br>
the area bounded: axially on the left by the planetary gear set 22, axially on the<br>
right by the second end wall 104, radially outward by reference line "M", and<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
radially inward by reference line "L". Zone F is defined by the area bounded:<br>
axially on the left by the first end wall 102, axially on the right by the second end<br>
wall 104, radially inward by reference line "M" and radially outward by the third<br>
wall 106. As will be described and illustrated hereinafter, planetary gear sets 16,<br>
18, 20, and 22 will change positions within the transmission cavity 108, however,<br>
the Zones described above will not change and will remain the same as shown<br>
throughout the Figures.<br>
[0036] In the arrangement of the transmission 10 shown in FIG. 1A, the<br>
planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22 are longitudinally arranged in the following<br>
order from left to right: 16-18-20-22. Specifically, the planetary gear set 16 is<br>
disposed closest to the wall 102, the planetary gear set 22 is disposed closest to<br>
the wall 104, the planetary gear set 18 is adjacent the planetary gear set 16, and<br>
the planetary gear set 20 is disposed between the planetary gear sets 18 and 22.<br>
The torque-transmitting mechanisms are intentionally located within specific<br>
Zones in order to provide advantages in overall transmission size, packaging<br>
efficiency, and reduced manufacturing complexity. In the particular example<br>
shown in FIG. 1A, the torque-transmitting mechanism C1 is disposed within Zone<br>
C, the torque-transmitting mechanisms C2 and C3 are disposed within Zone D,<br>
and the torque-transmitting mechanisms B1 and B2 are disposed within Zone F.<br>
[0037] However, the present invention contemplates other<br>
embodiments where the torque-transmitting mechanisms C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2<br>
are disposed in the other Zones. The feasible locations of the torque-transmitting<br>
devices C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 relative to the Zones are illustrated in the chart<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
shown in FIG. 1B. An "X" in the chart indicates that the present invention<br>
contemplates locating the particular torque-transmitting device in any of the<br>
referenced Zones.<br>
[0038] With reference to FIG. 1C, an alternate embodiment of the<br>
multi-speed transmission is indicated by reference number 10B. The<br>
transmission 10B includes the planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22 and the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2. The various<br>
components and connecting shafts that are identical with the transmission 10 in<br>
FIG. 1A have the same numerical designation.<br>
[0039] The transmission 10B includes the planetary gear sets 16, 18,<br>
20, and 22 longitudinally arranged identically to the arrangement shown in FIG.<br>
1A. However, in the particular example shown in FIG. 1C, the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms C1 and C2 are disposed within Zone B. As in the<br>
previous embodiment, the torque-transmitting mechanism C3 is disposed within<br>
Zone D and the torque-transmitting mechanisms B1 and B2 are disposed within<br>
Zone F.<br>
[0040] Additionally, the present invention contemplates other<br>
embodiments of transmission 10B where the torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 are disposed in the other Zones. The feasible locations<br>
of the torque-transmitting devices C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 relative to the Zones<br>
are illustrated in the chart shown in FIG. 1D. An "X" in the chart indicates that<br>
the present invention contemplates locating the particular torque-transmitting<br>
device in any of the referenced Zones.<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
[0041] Turning now to FIG. 2A, still another embodiment of the multi-<br>
speed transmission is indicated by reference number 200. The transmission 200<br>
includes the planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22 and the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2. The various components and connecting<br>
shafts that are identical with the transmission 10 in FIG. 1A have the same<br>
numerical designation in FIG. 2A.<br>
[0042] The transmission 200 includes the planetary gear sets 16, 18,<br>
20, and 22 longitudinally arranged in the following order from left to right: 18-20-<br>
16-22. Specifically, the planetary gear set 18 is disposed closest to the wall 102,<br>
the planetary gear set 22 is disposed closest to the wall 104, the planetary gear<br>
set 20 is adjacent the planetary gear set 18, and the planetary gear set 16 is<br>
disposed between the planetary gear sets 20 and 22. The torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms are intentionally located within specific Zones in order to provide<br>
advantages in overall transmission size, packaging efficiency, and reduced<br>
manufacturing complexity. In the particular example shown in FIG. 2A, the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms C1 and C2 are disposed within Zone A, the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism C3 is disposed within Zone C, and the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms B1 and B2 are disposed within Zone F.<br>
[0043] However, the present invention contemplates other<br>
embodiments of the transmission 200 where the torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 are disposed in the other Zones. The feasible locations<br>
of the torque-transmitting devices C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2 relative to the Zones<br>
are illustrated in the chart shown in FIG. 2B. An "X" in the chart indicates that<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001182-PTT-DLT<br>
the present invention contemplates locating the particular torque-transmitting<br>
device in any of the referenced Zones.<br>
[0044] With reference to FIG. 3A, still another embodiment of the multi-<br>
speed transmission is indicated by reference number 300. The transmission 300<br>
includes the planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20, and 22 and the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms C1, C2, C3, B1, and B2. The various components and connecting<br>
shafts that are identical with the transmission 10 in FIG. 1A have the same<br>
numerical designation in FIG. 3A.<br>
[0045] The transmission 300 includes the planetary gear sets 16, 18,<br>
