In that which follows, protective group Gp or G'p is understood to mean a group which makes it possible, first, to protect a reactive functional group, such as a hydroxyl or an amine, during a synthesis and, secondly, to regenerate the intact reactive functional group at the end of the synthesis.<br><br>
10<br><br>
Examples of protective groups and methods for protection and deprotection are given in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Green et al.r 2nd Edition (John Wiley 5 Sons Inc., New York).<br>
The term "leaving group" is understood to mean, in that which follows, a group which can be easily cleaved from a molecule by splitting a heterolytic bond, with departure of an electron pair. This group can thus be easily replaced by another group during a substitution reaction, for example. Such leaving groups are, for example, halogens or an activated hydroxyl group, such as a mesyl, tosyl, triflate, acetyl, and the like. Examples of leaving groups and references for their preparation are given in "Advances in Organic Chemistry", J. March, 3rd Edition, Wiley Interscience, p. 310-316.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared according to the following process.<br>
This process is characterized in that: a 2-aminoindole of far-mti±S~r~<br><br>
11<br>
in which R1, R2, R4 and R5 are as defined for a compound of formula (I), is reacted with an ester of formula:<br><br>
in which R3 is as defined for a compound of formula {I) and Alk represents a C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a polar and preferably basic solvent, for example in pyridine, at a temperature of between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
Generally, it is also possible to prepare, according to the process of the invention, a compound of formula:<br><br>
in which the R'1, R'2, R'3, R' 4 and R' 5 substituents are precursors of the Rl, R2, R3, R4 and R5 substituents as defined for a compound of formula (I), and then, by using methods known to a person skilled in the art, to convert these substituents in order to obtain the R1,<br><br>
12<br>
R2, R3, R1 and R5 substituents desired for the compound of formula (I).<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which Rx and/or R2 is an alkyl group is prepared from a compound of formula (I) in which R1 or R2 is hydrogen by the action of an alkyl iodide in the presence of NaH.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) in which the R1 substituent is a - (CH2) nC02 (C1-C4) Alk Or - (CH2) nCONR6R7 group are prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula (I)' in which Ri - H and R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the same values.<br>
For example, a compound of formula (I) in which Ri = H can be substituted by a (CH2)2CN group by reacting with a compound of formula Br(CH2)nCN in the presence of sodium hydride.<br>
Furthermore, in order to prepare a compound of formula (I) in which Ri represents a (CH2) nNR' 6R' 1 group, a brominated compound of formula Br(CH2) nNR' eR'7 can be reacted with a compound of formula (I) in which Ri = H.<br>
More generally, in order to prepare a compound of formula (I) in which Ri represents a (CH2)nNR'6R'7 group, a compound of formula X(CH2)nNGp in which X represents a leaving group, such as a bromine atom or a mesyl or tosyl group, for example, and Gp represents a protective group for the nitrogen can be reacted with a compound of formula (I) in which R3. = H; after deprotection of the nitrogen, it is possible, if<br><br>
13<br>
appropriate, to alkylate the amine formed by using methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
To prepare a compound of formula (I) in which R1 represents a (CH2)nOH group, a compound of formula X(CH2)nO-G'p in which X is a leaving group and G'p is a protective group for the oxygen can be reacted with a compound of formula (I) in which Rx - H and then the compound thus obtained can be treated to remove the protective group by methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
To prepare a compound of formula (I) in which the R3 and/or R4 and/or R5 substituents comprise a hydroxymethyl, hydroxyiminomethyl, alkylaminomethyl or dialkylaminornethyl group, the corresponding compound of formula (I) carrying an R3 and/or R4 and/or R5 substituent comprising a cyano group is converted by methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
To prepare a compound of formula {I) in which the R3 and/or R4 and/or R5 substituents comprise a hydroxyl group, it is possible to prepare first an analogous compound of formula (I) in which the R3 and/or R4 and/or R5 substituents comprise a protected hydroxyl group and then, in a subsequent stage, to convert this group to a hydroxyl by methods known to a person skilled in the art. Use may be made, as protective group for the hydroxyl, of a benzyl, a benzoyl or a (C1-C4) alkyl, for example.<br><br>
14<br>
The compounds of formula (I) in which R4 and/or R5 represent a Br atom or the substituent (s) on the R3 phenyl group represent(s) one (or several) bromine atom(s) can be used as precursors for preparing other compounds according to the invention, for example compounds carrying amirie substituents, such as (CH2)nNReR7 or (CH2) mNR'7R10/ by using reactions known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds carrying a brominated substituent are also of use for the preparation of compounds carrying an alkoxycarbonyl substituent.<br>
The aminoindoles of formula (II) can be prepared by methods such as those described in Khim. Geterosikl. Soedin., 1973, V2, 647-652 and in J. Heterocycl. Chem., 1975, 12, 135-138.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention were tested in vitro on a human breast cancer cell line: the MDA-MB-231 line available from the American Type Culture Collection (reference HTB26).<br>
The antiproliferative effect is evaluated according to J.M. Derocq et al., FEES Letters, 1998, 425, 419-425: the level of incorporation of [3H]thymidine in the DNA of the treated cells is measured after incubating a compound of formula (I) for 96 hours. The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) is defined as the concentration which inhibits cell proliferation by 50%.<br>
The compounds according to the invention<br>
exhibit an IC50 generally of less than 10 uM with regard to the MDA-MB-231 line.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) were also tested on another human breast cancer cell line, a "multi-drug-resistant" (MDR) line referred to as MDA-Ai- This line is described by E. Collomb, C. Dussert and P.M. Martin in Cytometry, 1991, Y^{1) r 15-25.<br>
The term "multi-resistant" which describes this line means that the said line is generally not very sensitive to the chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used and in particular to antimitotics of natural origin, such as paclitaxel, vincristine or vinblastine.<br><br>

The compounds according to the invention<br>
exhibit an IC50 generally of less than 10 uM with regard to the MDA-Aa multi-resistant line.<br>
The compounds according to the invention were also tested in vivo in murine models of human tumour xenografts according to the methods described in the literature: Mooberry S.L. et al.. Int. J. Cancer, 2003, 104 (4), 512-521; Polin L. et al., Invest. New Drugs, 2002, 2C) (1), 13-22; Corbett T.H et al., Invest. New Drugs, 1999, 11_ (1), 17-27. Fragments of human tumours with a diameter of 2 to 3 mm are implanted subcutaneously in SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) mice of the Balb/C strain (Iffa-Credo, Lyons, France). When these tumours reach a weight of 50-60 mg, the compounds are administered orally or intravenously every day or every two days throughout the duration of the experiment (20 to 40 days) at doses varying from 10 to 300 mg/kg per administration. The weight of the tumours is estimated according to the formula: W (weight of the tumour in mg) ~ (a*b2)/2, where a and b respectively represent the length and the width in mm of the tumour implant. The measurement of a and of b is carried out using a calliper rule. The antitumour effectiveness is evaluated by comparing the mean weight of the tumours in the group of animals treated with the test compound (T) with that of the animals of the control group to<br><br>
98<br>
which only the solvent of the compound has been administered (C). This measurement, expressed as % of the ratio T/C, is carried out when C reaches approximately 1 000 mg. The compounds according to the invention demonstrated an in vivo antitumour activity (ratio T/C of less than 100%), some very significantly with a ratio T/C "of less than or equal to 42%.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, it is apparent that the compounds of formula (I) inhibit the proliferation of tumour cells, including those of cells exhibiting multi-resistance. It is thus apparent that the compounds according to the invention have an anticancer activity.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject-matter of the invention is medicaments which comprise a compound of formula (I) or an addition salt of the latter with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or also a hydrate or a solvate of the compound of formula (I).<br>
These medicaments find their use in<br>
therapeutics, in particular in the treatment of or protection from diseases caused or exacerbated by the proliferation of tumour cells.<br>
These compounds, as inhibitor of the proliferation of tumour cells, are of use in the treatment of solid tumours, both primary and metastatic solid tumours, carcinomas and cancers, in particular:<br><br>
99<br>
breast cancer; lung cancer; cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the colon and of the rectum; cancer of the respiratory tract, of the oropharynx and of the hypopharynx; cancer of the oesophagus; liver cancer, stomach cancer, cancer of the bile ducts, cancer of the gall bladder, cancer of the pancreas; cancers of the urinary tract, including kidney, urothelium and bladder; cancers of the female genital tract, including cancer of the uterus, cervix and ovaries, choriocarcinoma and trophoblastic cancer; cancers of the male genital tract, including cancer of the prostate, seminal vesicles and testicles, tumours of the germinal cells; cancers of the endocrine glands, including cancer of the thyroid, pituitary gland and adrenal glands; skin cancers, including haemangiomas, melanomas and sarcomas, including Kaposi's sarcoma; tumours of the brain, nerves, eyes and meninges, including astrocytomas, gliomas, glioblastomas, retinoblastomas, neurinomas, neuroblastomas, schwannomas and meningiomas; solid tumours resulting from haematopoietic malignant tumours, including leukaemias, chloromas, plasmacytomas, fungoid mycosis, T-cell lymphoma or leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, malignant haemopathies and myelomas.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising,, as active principle, a<br><br>
100<br>
compound according to the invention. These pharmaceutical compositions comprise an effective dose of at least one compound according to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a hydrate or solvate of the said compound, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
The said excipients are chosen, according to the pharmaceutical form and the method of administration desired, from the usual excipients which are known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local, intra-tracheal, intranasal, transdermal or rectal administration, the active principle of formula (I) above, or its optional salt, solvate or hydrate, can be administered in unit administration form, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients, to animals and man for the prophylaxis or treatment of the above disorders or diseaseso<br>
The appropriate unit administration forms comprise forms by the oral route, such as tablets, soft or hard gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual, buccal, intra-tracheal, intraocular or intranasal, by inhalation, administration forms, topical, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous<br><br>
101<br>
administration forms, rectal administration forms and implants. Use may be made, for the topical application, of the compounds according to the invention in creams, gels, ointments or lotions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) above can be used at daily doses of 0.002 to 2 000 mg per kilogram of body weight of the mammal to be treated, preferably at daily doses of 0.1 to 300 mg/kg. In man, the dose can preferably vary from 0.02 to 10 000 mg per day, more particularly from 1 to 3 000 mg, depending on the age of the subject to be treated or the type of treatment: prophylactic or curative.<br>
There may be specific cases where higher or lower dosages are appropriate; such dosages do not depart from the scope of the invention. According to usual practice, the dosage appropriate to each patient is determined by the doctor according to the method of administration and the weight and response of the said patient.<br>
The present invention, according to another of its aspects, also relates to a method for the treatment of the pathologies indicated above which comprises the administration, to a patient, of an effective dose of a compound according to the invention, or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its hydrates or solvates.<br><br>
