				<td>Locally-propelled, Intraluminal Device with Cable Loop Track and Method of<br>
Use<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a medical device, and more particularly to a<br>
medical device that can be propelled along a cable located within a lumen of a<br>
patient's body.<br>
Background<br>
A physician typically accesses and visualizes tissue within a patient's<br>
gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a long, flexible endoscope. For the upper GI, a<br>
physician may insert a gastroscope into the sedated patient's mouth to examine and<br>
treat tissue in the esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum. For the lower GI, a<br>
physician may insert a colonoscope through the sedated patient's anus to examine the<br>
rectum and colon. Some endoscopes have a working channel, typically about 2.5-<br>
3.5mm in diameter, extending from a port in the handpiece to the distal tip of the<br>
flexible shaft. A physician may insert medical instruments into the working channel<br>
to help diagnose or treat tissues within the patient. Physicians commonly take tissue<br>
biopsies from the mucosal lining of the GI tract using a flexible, biopsy forceps<br>
through the working channel of the endoscope.<br>
Insertion of a flexible endoscope, especially into the colon, is usually a very<br>
time-consuming and uncomfortable procedure for the patient, even when sedated<br>
with drugs. A physician often needs several minutes to push a flexible endoscope<br>
through the convoluted sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending portions of<br>
the colon. The physician may diagnose and/or treat tissues within the colon either<br>
during insertion or removal of the endoscope. Often the flexible endoscope "loops"<br>
within the colon, such as at the sigmoid colon or at the splenic flexure of the colon,<br>
so that it becomes difficult to further advance the endoscope along the colon. When<br>
a loop is formed, the force exerted to push the scope stretches the mesentery and<br>
causes pain for the patient. Depending on the anatomy of the patient and the skill of<br><br>
the physician in manipulating the flexible endoscope, some portions of the colon<br>
may be unexamined, thus increasing the risk of undiagnosed disease.<br>
Given® Engineering LTD, Yoqneam, Israel, sells a device in the U.S. called<br>
the M2A™ Swallowable Imaging Capsule. The device contains a tiny video camera,<br>
battery, and transmitter. It is propelled through the gastrointestinal tract by natural<br>
peristalsis. The device is currently used for diagnostic purposes and passes through<br>
the intestinal tract with a velocity determined by the natural, peristaltic action of the<br>
patient's body. World Publication No. WO 0108548A1 filed by C. Mosse, et al.<br>
describes a self-propelling device adapted to travel through a passage having walls<br>
containing contractile tissue. The applicants disclose that the device is particularly<br>
useful as an enteroscope and may also carry objects such as feeding tubes, guide<br>
wires, physiological sensors or conventional endoscopes within the gut. A summary<br>
of other alternatives to push endoscopy can be found in "Technical Advances and<br>
Experimental Devices for Enteroscopy" by C. Mosse, et al, published in<br>
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America, Volume 9, Number 1, January<br>
1999: pp. 145-161.<br>
Scientists and Engineers continue to seek improved methods and devices for<br>
accessing, diagnosing and/or treating tissue within body lumens, including the GI<br>
tract.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Applicant has recognized the desirability of a low cost, potentially disposable<br>
locally-propelled intraluminal device which may provide physicians with a desirable<br>
alternative to using a conventional, reusable, flexible endoscope. Eliminating the<br>
need for the operator to make constant adjustment of the articulation controls of an<br>
endoscope may reduce the skill required to intubate the device, allowing operators<br>
other than physicians to use the device. This is advantageous because<br>
gastroenterologists currently do not have the capacity to handle all of the patients<br>
that need colonoscopies, so equipment that enables other staff, such as nurses, to<br>
help with the procedure could increase the capacity and allow gastroenterologists to<br>
treat more patients.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a medical device<br>
comprising an apparatus, such as a shaped capsule, adapted for movement within a<br>
body lumen, and a track extending proximal and distal of the capsule. A portion of<br>
the track extending distal of the capsule comprises a loop.<br>
The track can comprise a fixed portion, such as a fixed end which is held<br>
stationary with respect to the patient's body,, and a free end which can be<br>
manipulated to feed additional track through the capsule to increase the length of the<br>
portion of the track comprising the loop. The fixed and free ends of the track can be<br>
located proximal of the capsule, and the portion of the track comprising the loop can<br>
be located distal of the capsule.<br>
The track can extend from the free end to pass through the capsule, such as<br>
by sliding through a channel in the capsule, and can extend from the channel around<br>
the loop, and then re-enter the capsule for engagement with a driving mechanism<br>
supported on the capsule. The driving mechanism can comprise a traction pulley<br>
and gear arrangement.<br>
The capsule can comprise a working channel extending through the capsule<br>
for providing access with a medical instrument from outside the body lumen to an<br>
inside wall of the body lumen. The capsule can also include an illumination device,<br>
a viewing window, and a camera or other visualization device. A flexible umbilicus<br>
for accommodating the working channel, vacuum lines, electrical cables, and/or<br>
optic cables can extend from the capsule to provide communication between the<br>
capsule and a point outside the patient's body.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of moving a medical apparatus<br>
through a patient's body, such as through the GI tract. The method can comprise the<br>
steps of propelling an apparatus such as a capsule along a track disposed at least<br>
partially within the body, and increasing the length of the track distal of the capsule<br>
while holding a portion of the track, such as an end of the track, stationary with<br>
respect to a part of the patient's body. In one embodiment the method comprises<br>
providing a track in the patient's GI tract; propelling the apparatus along the track to<br>
a position proximal of a bend in the GI tract; providing additional track length distal<br>
of the apparatus to provide a track portion that extends distal of the bend in the GI<br>
tract; and propelling the apparatus on the track through the bend in the GI tract. The<br>
present invention also provides a method that advances an intermediate portion of<br><br>
track distally through a body lumen, and then propelling an apparatus along the<br>
intermediate portion of the track, as opposed to advancing an end of a guide wire<br>
distally through a body lumen.<br>
The invention can be used to assist in the placement of instruments including<br>
without limitation balloons, dilators, tissue graspers, tissue cutting devices, tissue<br>
stapling devices, tissue staining or treatment devices, vessel ligation devices, and<br>
tissue ablation devices. The track, in the form of a cable, can be fed by the operator<br>
into the lumen ahead of the locally-propelled capsule to provide a track for the<br>
capsule to follow through the tortuous path of the colon, providing a means for<br>
advancing or retracting the device. The cable track allows propulsion along a track<br>
that is independent of the physical characteristics of the lumen wall, which may be<br>
diseased, fatigued, or oddly shaped. As the operator slides more cable through the<br>
capsule, the size of the cable loop increases (for instance, because another portion or<br>
end of the cable is held stationary, such as by the capsule drive mechanism or by an<br>
anchor point). As the loop gets bigger, the loop "unfurls" around bends or other<br>
obstructions in the colon, thus creating a path around bends or obstructions in the GI<br>
tract without operator manipulation of articulating controls.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a locally-propelled<br>
intraluminal medical device. By way of example, the present invention is illustrated<br>
and described for application in the colon of the lower GI tract of a human patient.<br>
However, the present invention is applicable for use in the body lumens of other<br>
hollow organs in humans and in other mammals.<br>
FIG.l shows a medical device 70 of the present invention. The medical<br>
device 70 can include a movable apparatus, such as a capsule 80 shaped and sized<br>
for movement through a body lumen, a compressible sleeve 40, a fixing plate 50, an<br>
umbilicus 30, a cable 25, a video unit 72, and a handpiece 20.<br><br>
Capsule 80 generally has a leading end 64 that is smooth for atraumatic<br>
passage through a tortuous path of a gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as a colon. In<br>
one embodiment of capsule 80, leading end 64 is hemispherical and a trailing end 65<br>
is flat to accept the contents contained in umbilicus 30. Other shapes of capsule 80<br>
are possible, such as but not limited to tapered, cylindrical, ovoid, or egg-shaped<br>
configurations, to facilitate navigation through the colon.<br>
Compressible sleeve 40 can extend from trailing end 65 of capsule 80 to<br>
fixing plate 50. Fixing plate 50 can be anchored to the patient with adhesive. Other<br>
methods of attachment to the patient include, but are not limited to glue, tape, or a<br>
close-fitting wrap. Suture or staples may also be used, but are less desirable because<br>
of the pain involved in their placement or removal. In applications related to the<br>
lower GI tract, fixing plate 50 can extend into the patient's anus. A secure<br>
attachment of plate 50 to the patients body or other fixture is desirable so that fixing<br>
plate 50 provides an anchor, thereby enhancing movement of capsule 80 deeper<br>
into the colon.<br>
The proximal portion of umbilicus 30 can extend outside the body and can be<br>
connected to equipment, including video unit 72 and handpiece 20. The distal<br>
portion of umbilicus 30 can be connected to trailing end 65 of capsule 80 inside the<br>
colon. Umbilicus 30 can extend through openings in plate 50 and sleeve 40, and<br>
umbilicus 30 can slide through the openings relative to plate 50 and sleeve 40.<br>
Umbilicus 30 is preferably made from a lightweight, flexible, plastic, multilumen<br>
tube. For example, umbilicus 30 may have four lumens: a 3mm lumen for a working<br>
channel 36, a 3mm diameter lumen for the wiring assembly 34, a 5mm diameter<br>
lumen to receive a drive cable 32, and a 3mm lumen to receive cable 25. Many<br>
other sizes and combinations of lumens are possible. Umbilicus 30 may also<br>
comprise separate thin-wall, flexible plastic tubes that are bundled together with<br>
straps, shrink-wrap, or the like.<br>
Cable 25 can provide a track on which capsule 80 is supported and propelled.<br>
Cable 25 may be constructed in numerous shapes, including a braided strand of<br>
fibers, a coated wire, a flat band, or may have a constant cross sectional shape<br>
including circular, triangular, or rectangular. Cable 25 may include a periodic and/or<br>
non periodic pattern of features that assist in traction, such as teeth, holes, or<br>
grooves. Cable 25 may be made from any suitable material, including without<br><br>
limitation one or more metals including steel, nitinol, aluminum, or titanium, and<br>
have diameters including, but not limited to, 0.5rnm to 2.5mm. A proximal portion<br>
of cable 25 extends outside the body, so that an operator can handle it. Cable 25 is<br>
fed through umbilicus 30, though capsule 80, to form a cable loop 54 ahead (distally)<br>
of capsule 80. As described below, cable loop 54 can be used to navigate around the<br>
tortuous path of the colon, eliminating the need for the operator to make constant<br>
adjustment of the articulation controls of an endoscope, thus reducing the skill<br>
required to intubate the device. As alternatives to cable 25, other suitable track<br>
configurations can be used, including without limitation flexible rails, chains, slides,<br>
and belts.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 1, video unit 72 supplies power to a lighting device 96<br>
(FIG. 9), and processes video images taken by a visualization device 95 (FIG. 9) in<br>
capsule 80 as it moves through the colon so that the operator is able to view the<br>
inside surface of the lumen. Lighting device 96 may include a bulb or LED (Light<br>
Emitting Diode) contained within capsule 80, or include a fiberoptic, a light pipe, or<br>
a lens of a light source contained in video unit 72. One example of a bulb that could<br>
be located in capsule 80 is Xenon #724 from Carley Lamps (Torrance, CA).<br>
Visualization device 95 may be a CMOS (Complementary Metallic Oxide<br>
Semiconductor) or CCD (Charged Coupled Device) camera, either of which are<br>
commercially available in sizes adaptable to use in capsule 80. For example, a<br>
CMOS chip such as #OV7620 from Omnivision Technologies (Sunnyvale, CA)<br>
could be used. Wiring assembly 34 transfers signals between video unit 72 and<br>
lighting device 96 and between video unit 72 and visualization device 95.<br>
Handpiece 20 provides a motion control 58 to activate the propulsion of<br>
capsule 80 along cable 25. Capsule 80 can be propelled along cable 25 in any<br>
suitable manner. In one embodiment, handpiece 20 contains a motor and operably<br>
controls a flexible drive cable 32, which is constructed to transmit torque, to operate<br>
a propulsion mechanism 44 (FIG. 7) located inside capsule 80 to move medical<br>
device 70 further into the colon. In one embodiment, motion control 58 has a<br>
forward and reverse setting to change the rotation of a motor within handpiece 20 so<br>
that capsule 80 moves in a forward and backward direction along cable 25.<br>
The proximal portion of working channel 36 extends out of the body to a<br>
location near handpiece 20, so that the operator can pass medical instruments in and<br><br>
out of the colon numerous times. The distal portion of working channel 36 extends<br>
through capsule 80 to an opening in the outer surface of the leading edge 64 of<br>
capsule 80. Medical instruments can be inserted into the proximal end of working<br>
channel 36 and be directed through working channel to the opening in the outer<br>
surface of the capsule 80 without removing the capsule 80 from the body lumen.<br>
Accordingly, the operator can access lumen tissue adjacent the capsule 80 with the<br>
medical instruments as the capsule is moved through the lumen. Medical<br>
instruments which can be directed through a working channel include without<br>
limitation tissue graspers, staplers, cutters, clip appliers, tissue ablation devices,<br>
tissue staining devices, and devices for dispensing pharmaceutical agents.<br>
FIG. 2 shows medical device 70 of FIG. 1 including a cable spool 74 outside<br>
the body, and cable loop 54 ahead (distal) of capsule 80. Cable spool 74 stores a<br>
proximal portion of cable 25, and may be used to unwind an additional length of<br>
cable 25 through umbilicus 30 and a sliding channel 90, to increase the size of cable<br>
loop 54 ahead of capsule 80 in the colon.<br>
Cable loop 54 is formed ahead of capsule 80 from a middle portion of cable<br>
25. One end of cable loop 54 is formed by cable extending distally outward from a<br>
sliding channel 90, and the other end (the return end) of cable loop 54 is formed by<br>
cable extending proximally into an opening in the outer surface of the capsule 80,<br>
where the cable is fed though (and is engaged by) a gripping channel 91 in the<br>
capsule 80. The cable extends from the gripping channel 91 proximally through<br>
compressible sleeve 40 (outside of umbilicus 30) to cable anchor 52. This<br>
arrangement allows an operator to feed an additional portion of cable 25 through<br>
sliding channel 90 to increase the size of cable loop 54 (other end of loop is held by<br>
gripping channel 91). As cable loop 54 increases in size, it "unfurls" inside the<br>
lumen directly ahead of capsule 80, and generally conforms to bends or curves in the<br>
lumen, thereby laying a track along and/or distal to the bend on which to propel the<br>
capsule. This arrangement of cable loop 54 can be advantageous in simplifying the<br>
process of navigating the colon. The operator can simply add length to the loop<br>
portion of the cable to negotiate bends and turns in the GI tract, rather than trying to<br>
manipulate the end of a guide tube or guide wire through the three dimensional<br>
curvature of the lumen. The operator then uses motion control 58 (FIG. 1) to<br><br>
advance capsule 80 in a forward direction along the track (the cable loop 54) to<br>
move the capsule 80 through the bend in colon.<br>
FIG. 3 shows medical device 70 positioned in the colon. Cable loop 54 is<br>
introduced first, with capsule 80, compressible sleeve 40, and fixing plate 50 trailing<br>
behind it. Fixing plate 50 can then be securely affixed to the anus or other suitable<br>
location with adhesive or by other means, creating an anchor point relative to the<br>
patient.<br>
Cable loop 54 is shown deployed around a bend in the sigmoid colon 100.<br>
Hie operator monitors progress of capsule 80 and cable loop 54 by viewing video<br>
unit 72 (FIG. 1), which displays images taken by visualization device 95 (FIG. 9).<br>
When cable loop 54 reaches a sufficient orientation to navigate a bend in the colon,<br>
capsule 80 is propelled a short distance along cable 25 by propulsion mechanism 44<br>
(FIG. 7) under control of the operator who activates motion control 58 (FIG. 1).<br>
This process shortens the length of cable loop 54 ahead (distal) of capsule 80.<br>
To further advance capsule 80 deeper into the colon, the operator slides more<br>
of the proximal portion of cable 25 through umbilicus 30 and sliding channel 90 to<br>
again increase the size of cable loop 54 ahead of capsule 80. This procedure lays<br>
additional track through additional bends that are deeper in the colon, such as the left<br>
splenic flexure 112 or the hepatic flexure 110. The operator continues to slide<br>
cable 25 and activate motion control 58 (FIG. 1), in sequence, to incrementally<br>
move capsule 80 through the descending colon 102, transverse colon 104, and<br>
ascending colon 106 to cecum 108.<br>
As capsule 80 advances along cable 25.compressible sleeve 40 begins to<br>
uncompress (increase in length) so that a smooth, uninterrupted surface is<br>
maintained from fixing plate 50 to capsule 80.<br>
FIG. 4 is a detailed view of medical device 70 generally comprising capsule<br>
80, compressible sleeve 40, fixing plate 50, and umbilicus 30. In this embodiment,<br>
capsule 80 is comprised of three sections (a 1st section 77, a 2nd section 78, and a 3ld<br>
section 79) for assembly and contains propulsion mechanism 44 (FIG. 7). Other<br>
embodiments with a different arrangement or number of sections, or other locations<br>
of propulsion mechanism 44 are possible. Visualization device 95 (FIG. 9) and<br>
lighting device 96 (FIG. 9), located near leading end 64 of capsule 80, communicate<br>
with video unit 72 through wiring assembly 34 to allow visualization of the inside of<br><br>
the lumen in the vicinity of capsule 80. Working channel 36 allows an operator to<br>
repeatedly pass medical instruments in and out of the patient to perform treatment in<br>
the vicinity of capsule 80, without removing capsule 80 from the body lumen.<br>
Compressible sleeve 40 can perform at least two functions. First,<br>
compressible sleeve can provide a smooth, uninterrupted, flexible connection<br>
between fixing plate 50 and capsule 80 as it advances deeper into the colon, to<br>
thereby assist in protecting the body lumen from damage as medical device 70<br>
navigates the colon. Additionally, compressible sleeve 40 can act to radially confine<br>
a portion of cable 25 located between gripping channel 91 and cable anchor 52 to<br>
assist in the propulsion of capsule 80 in a forward direction deeper into the colon.<br>
By radially confining a portion of cable 25 between gripping channel 91 and anchor<br>
52, the sleeve 40 can assist in preventing a secondary loop from forming in cable 25<br>
between capsule 80 and fixing plate 50 (prevents formation of a cable loop behind<br>
(proximal) of capsule 80). Compressible sleeve 40 may be made from any suitable<br>
material, including without limitation ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), or<br>
other suitable flexible material that stretch or otherwise increase in length to<br>
accommodate the increased distance between the anchor 52 and the capsule 80 as the<br>
capsule moves deeper into the Gl tract.<br>
Propulsion mechanism 44 uses a portion of cable 25 inside gripping channel<br>
91 to propel capsule 80 further into the colon. As motion control 58 (FIG. 1) is<br>
activated, propulsion mechanism 44 moves a portion of cable 25, initially<br>
comprising cable loop 54, back through gripping channel 91 to a position between<br>
capsule 80 and fixing plate 50. Therefore, the length of cable 25 between capsule 80<br>
and fixing plate 50 increases. Because cable 25 is anchored to the patient by fixing<br>
plate 50 and radially confined by compressible sleeve 40, cable 25 supplies an axial<br>
force to counteract a traction force applied by propulsion mechanism 44, resulting in<br>
capsule 80 being propelled further into the colon.<br>
The location of propulsion mechanism 44 inside capsule 80 is advantageous<br>
because it locally propels capsule 80 a short distance from a position already within<br>
the colon. This decreases the forces needed to push an entire length of endoscope or<br>
other long flexible extension through the tortuous colon. However, other<br>
mechanisms or locations for mechanisms may be used to accomplish the propulsion.<br>
For example, propulsion mechanism 44 can be positioned anywhere that allows the<br><br>
length of cable 25 between fixing plate 50 and capsule 80 to vary in length,<br>
including a separate pod between capsule 80 and fixing plate 50, a separate housing<br>
attached to fixing plate 50, or contained within a portion of fixing plate 50.<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross section of medical device 70 taken at line 5-5 of FIG. 1,<br>
showing one embodiment of fixing plate 50 having a relatively large diameter sized<br>
for securing it to a patient's anus. Cable anchor 52 is shown as a rigid attachment to<br>
fixing plate 50, so that the distal portion of cable 25 does not move relative to fixing<br>
plate 50. Centering attachment 56 holds umbilicus 30 in the center of fixing plate 50<br>
for alignment through the anus into the colon.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a detailed view of the cross section of umbilicus 30 from FIG.<br>
5, including a lumen for cable 25, a lumen for wiring assembly 34, a lumen for drive<br>
cable 32, and working channel 36. FIG. 6 indicates the relative positions and sizes<br>
of these lumens and elements in this embodiment of umbilicus 30. Numerous other<br>
sizes and arrangements are possible. For example, additional working channels<br>
could be added, working channel 36 could be sized larger to allow for passage of<br>
larger instruments, or the lumen for drive cable 32 could be smaller. In general, it is<br>
advantageous to have a small diameter and lightweight umbilicus 30 so that capsule<br>
80 has as little drag as possible when advancing through the colon.<br>
FIG. 7 is an isometric view of one embodiment of compressible sleeve 40<br>
and capsule 80 including sliding channel 90, gripping channel 91, working channel<br>
36, and propulsion mechanism 44 including a first miter gear 82, a second miter gear<br>
83, a pulley 86, and a pulley grip 87. This illustration shows the relative positions<br>
of these elements in three-dimensional space.<br>
Propulsion mechanism 44 works by changing the length of cable 25 between<br>
capsule 80 and fixing plate 50, which has been secured to the patient's body. In this<br>
manner, capsule 80 can move deeper into the colon when this length of cable 25<br>
increases, and moves backward out of the colon when this length decreases. In this<br>
embodiment, propulsion mechanism 44 comprises a gear system described below<br>
contained within capsule 80, but other locations and systems are possible<br>
FIG. 8 is a cross sectional view of capsule 80 taken at line 8-8 of FIG. 7,<br>
showing an arrangement of gears in this embodiment of propulsion mechanism 44<br>
(FIG. 7). The distal portion of drive cable 32 passes through trailing end 65 of<br>
capsule 80 and coaxially connects to first miter gear 82. Drive cable 32 is<br><br>
constructed to transmit torque from handpiece 20 to first miter gear 82, so that when<br>
the operator activates motion control 58 (FIG. 1), first miter gear 82 rotates around<br>
an axis collinear with drive cable 32.<br>
In the embodiment shown, miter gears 82 and 83 are supported in the capsule<br>
80 (such as by a suitable bearing or bushing) for rotation about their respective axes<br>
of rotation, which are generally perpendicular to one another. The teeth of first miter<br>
gear 82 and second miter gear 83 are each cut at a 45-degree angle, so that rotational<br>
motion around the axis of drive cable 32 is converted to rotation around another axis<br>
90 degrees to the first. Therefore, when the operator activates motion control 58,<br>
first miter gear 82 rotates about its axis of rotation, and transmits torque to second<br>
miter gear 83, causing gear 83 to rotate about its axis of rotation.<br>
Pulley 86 is coaxially coupled to second miter gear 83, and pully 86 is<br>
supported for rotation about the axis of rotation of miter gear 83. When second<br>
miter gear 83 rotates, pulley 86 rotates with gear 83 around its axis of rotation. A<br>
portion of cable 25 contained within gripping channel 91 is in contact with pulley<br>
86. Gripping channel 91 and pulley grip 87 act in concert to prevent slippage and<br>
apply a traction force from pulley 86 to cable 25, as pulley 86 rotates. In a fashion<br>
similar to a train wheel propelling a locomotive along a railroad track, pulley 86<br>
propels capsule 80 along cable 25. The result of this motion increases the length of<br>
cable 25 between capsule 80 and fixing plate 50 to propel capsule 80 further into the<br>
colon.<br>
FIG. 9 is a sectional view of capsule 80 taken at line 9-9 of FIG. 8. It shows<br>
the relative positions of visualization device 95, lighting device 96, cable 25, and<br>
pulley 86 within capsule 80. In this embodiment, wiring assembly 34 divides into<br>
two bundles before it passes through trailing end 65 of capsule 80. One bundle<br>
communicates with lighting device 96, and the other bundle communicates with<br>
visualization device 95. Lighting device 96 shines light to illuminate the region of<br>
the lumen in the vicinity of capsule 80. Visualization device 95 transmits images<br>
taken at this location back through wiring assembly 34 to video unit 72 for the<br>
operator to view.<br>
FIG. 10 is a cross sectional view of capsule 80 taken at line 10-10 of FIG. 9.<br>
As shown in this view gripping channel 91 is positioned and aligned so as to direct<br>
cable 25 into the pulley grip 86, and pulley grip 86 holds cable 25 in contact with<br><br>
pulley 86. Sliding channel 90 is also shown in a position within the GI tract which is<br>
free of obstructions (e.g. sharp curves or bends in the colon) so that the operator can<br>
slide cable 25 in a forward direction to increase the size of cable loop 54 (FIG. 2)<br>
ahead of capsule 80. This embodiment shows wiring assembly 34 split into two<br>
bundles, one bundle on either side of first miter gear 82. One of the bundles<br>
connects to visualization device 95, and the other bundle connects to illuminating<br>
device 96.<br>
Generally, medical device 70 is propelled through the colon under control of<br>
the operator for examination and treatment of sites within the lumen. Medical<br>
device 70 is placed into a patient's colon through the anus. Fixing plate 50 is affixed<br>
to the patient at this location. The operator advances a proximal portion of cable 25<br>
through umbilicus 30 and sliding channel 90 to increase the size of cable loop 54<br>
ahead of capsule 80. As described above, this process provides a path around the<br>
tortuous bends of the colon for capsule 80 to follow.<br>
While viewing video unit 72, the operator sees the inside of the lumen in the<br>
vicinity of capsule 80. Motion control 58 of handpiece 20 is activated to advance<br>
capsule 80 along cable 25, moving it deeper into the colon. To further advance<br>
capsule 80, the operator again feeds cable 25 to further increase the size of cable<br>
loop 54, and again activates motion control 58. These steps are repeated until<br>
capsule 80 reaches a depth deemed sufficient by an operator, which is cecum 108 in<br>
many cases. At any time during the procedure, the operator may introduce and<br>
remove medical instruments through working channel 36 to treat a site in the patient.<br>
Medical device 70 is therefore useful for diagnosis as well as therapy.<br>
