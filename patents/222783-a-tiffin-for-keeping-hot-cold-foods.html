" A TIFFIN FOR KEEPING HOT &amp; COLD FOODS "<br>
M/s. Partham Overseas,<br>
An Indian Partnership Firm having Four partners:-<br>
(i)	Smt. Usha Kamal Arora.<br>
(ii)	Shri. Kamal Kishore Arora.<br>
(iii)	Smt. Rimpi Navin Arora.<br>
(v)	Shri. Vikash Kamal Arora.<br>
M/s. Partham Overseas,<br>
1/2, Sunshine Industrial Estate,<br>
Near Golani Stop, Waliv,<br>
Vasai, (East)<br>
Dist. Thane-401 208.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
This invention relates to a tiffin for keeping hot and cold food.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to a double <br>
walled strong and steady insulated tiffin which is capable of maintaining the temperatures of different individual food items kept therein almost at its original temperatures and without any problem of leakage or mixing of food and at the same time it is also easily adjustable for reducing the number of compartments as per requirements.<br>
Tiffin is used for carrying food for eating later on after <br>
few hours. Existing tiffins a number of compartments for <br>
keeping different food items like cooked dal, rice, vegetable,<br>
 roti, salad, curd, chutni, pickles, etc. The number of<br>
 compartments which are preferably made of stainless steel are stacked one above the other and are clamped together with a specially designed for a particular tiffin size which is also integrally provided with handle for lifting and carrying the<br>
 tiffin.<br>
These tiffins are not able to maintain the temperature of <br>
the food items and therefore are not preferred by most of the peoples specially of higher class or even of middle class. Further these tiffins are not leak proof and adjustable for changing the<br><br>
number of compartments as per requirements. Also the compartments stacked one above the other are press fitted into <br>
each other which sometimes create a big problem for opening. Further after some use compartments become either too tight to assemble or loose to fall apart easily thereby leaking, mixing and spoiling the food items.<br>
Another type of tiffin is also available which is able to<br>
 keep the food items at hot or cold temperature. In this type of tiffins a number of steel compartments are stacked one above <br>
the other and clamped together which are then placed inside a <br>
heat insulated large container, which helps in maintaining the inside temperature at the same level in all the compartments <br>
and prevents it from being influenced by the outside<br>
 atmospheric temperature.<br>
The main draw back of such type of tiffin is that the food items of all the compartments attain the same temperature after some time as heat flows from one compartment to another <br>
inside the heat insulated outer larger container. As such the hot food item kept in one steel compartment will cause warming of<br>
 the cold food item kept separately in another compartment.<br>
 Thus the hot Dal(pulse) or vegetable in one compartment will cause warming of the cold food item kept separately in another compartment.<br>
2<br><br>
3<br>
Thus the hot Dal (pulse) or vegetable in one compartment will cause warming of the cold curd kept in another <br>
compartment, resulting into the curd to break off from its<br>
 original condition, making the curd to loose the flavour and becoming sour in taste, thereby making the heat insulated fiffin<br>
 not suitable for all the food items. Further the steel containers, stacked inside the insulated large container (hot case) in the existing tiffins, use to break off collapse causing the food ingredients to fall in the hot case and sometimes even food ingredients get mixed with another, thereby spoiling the food.<br>
Futher the tiffin is not adjustable as the hot case is of fixed size and inside containers are also clamped in a fixed clamp and <br>
as such tiffin of various sizes are required to be purchased according to different requirements, such as two container tiffin, three container tiffin, four container tiffin, etc. further in the existing tiffins there is no provision for keeping salad, chatani, spoon, etc. and a separate container is used for keeping such items which also increases the size of tiffin.<br>
The main object of this invention is to obviate the above mentioned drawbacks of the existing tiffins and to provide a<br>
 tiffin for keeping hot food as well as cold food, separately in the adjacent two  containers/   compartments  of the  same  tiffin<br>
3<br><br>
without affecting the food ingredients and also keeping the hot food hot and cold food cold for a sufficient time.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a fiffin for keeping hot and cold food wherein the various compartments<br>
 are assembled in a steady and leakproof manner thereby preventing any break/fall of containers and mixing up of the <br>
food ingredients.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a tiffin for keeping hot and cold food, which is adjustable so as to allow a single tiffin to reduce/ vary in size namely four container, three container, two container or one container is to provide a tiffin <br>
for keeping hot and cold food which is quite easy to open and assemble and which does not require any separate clamping<br>
 means to keep all the containers clamped together.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a tiffin for hot and cold food in which the bottom cover of the tiffin is<br>
 utilized for keeping salad, chatani, spoon, etc. without <br>
occupying a separate container, thereby keeping the size of the tiffin small.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a tiffin for<br>
 hot and cold food which is sleek in size and aesthetic in look besides severing the main purpose of mamtaining the food hot<br>
4<br><br>
5<br>
and cold at its original temperatures without any leakage so that flavour and taste of the food ingredients are maintained.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides.<br>

Referring to Figs. 1 to 21 the tiffin (1) for keeping food hot and cold, according to an embodiment of this invention comprises a plurality of main boxes/ compartments (2), which can be one,<br>
 two or more, a cover dish(3) for each container, a bottom cover<br>
 (4) and a top cover (5) and a seal plate (6) provided in between<br>
 the two adjacent compartments and also between the compartments and the covers. Each compartment or main box <br>
(2) comprises a bowl (7) (as shown in Fig 19) preferable made of stainless steel which is strong, steady and non magnetic. Inner surface of the bowl is mirror finished. The steel bowl (7) forms <br>
the inner surface of the main (2). The outer container (8) of the main box (2) and the layer of chemical which reflect the outer temperature to effect the inner temperature and bring the inner temperature to a mulcteland which is called as such as PUF preferable Isocynate and polyol, which provide strong and<br>
9<br><br>
steady heat insulation. Further the outer container (8) is having <br>
two portions an upper portion (9) and a lower portion (10) separated by a partition wall (11), preferable integrated formed with the container wall made of heat insulation material. The<br>
 steel bowl (7) is accommodated in the upper portion (9) and it rests on the partion wall (11). The steel bowl (7) is rigidly<br>
 clamped inside the upper portion (9) with the help of a double walled clamp ring (12) (see Fig.14) made of heat insulation material, thereby forming a double walled strong and steady<br>
 heat insulated main box(2) of the tiffin (1). The lower portion<br>
 (10) is provided with inner threads (13) for easy connecting <br>
there to either another box (2) is provided with outer threads<br>
 (14) for easy connecting the box (2) or bottom cover (4). <br>
Similarly the top end of the box (2) is provided with outer <br>
threads (14) for easy connecting the box (2) with the inner <br>
threads (13) of the adjacent upper box or to the top cover(5). The bottom cover (4) is made of heat insulation material and is provided with outer threads (15) for easily connecting the same inside the lower portion of the main box (2). The bottom cover <br>
(4) is made sufficiently deep, like a bowl, so that, salad, chatani pot, or pouch, spoon, etc can be kept easily without occupying a separate compartment or main box (2). The Top Cover (5) is <br>
made of heat insulation material and is provided with inner<br>
10<br><br>
thread (16) for easy connecting to the top most main box(2). The top cover is also provided with strap connecting means such as slotted projections (17) for connecting a strap which is used for carrying the tiffin. The outer surfaces of the top and bottom<br>
 covers are provided with gripping means (18) for very easy holding for covers while putting on or moving from the main <br>
box (2). A cover dish (3), as shown in Fig. 7 is preferably <br>
provided for each main box (2). It is made of good quality <br>
plastics. It is used to cover the ingredients placed inside the <br>
main box (2). The seal plate (6) may also be provided in between the main boxes or between the covers &amp; main boxes for properly sealing the food ingredients filled inside the main box. It is<br>
 made of plastic. The Tiffin (1) as shown in Figs. 20 &amp; 21 is <br>
having five compartments main box (2) which are assembled together by threading, so there is no chance of falling out or breaking out of any of the compartment. Further the food ingredients are also kept in leak proof manner. The heat<br>
 insulation material on the outer side as well as in between the <br>
two compartments and also between the compartment and <br>
bottom cover totally prevents the heat transfer from inside and outside as well as from one compartment to another <br>
compartment and from bottom compartment to bottom cover, therefore   the   temperature   of   the   food   ingredients   in   a<br>
11<br><br>
compartment remains unaffected with the temperatures of the<br>
 other compartments. Hence a hot and cold food items can be<br>
 kept in the Tiffin (1). According to this invention the hot food<br>
 will be maintained hot and cold food will be maintained cold <br>
that is in the same condition in which it was packed and there <br>
will be no loss of flavour or taste of the food items. Further the tiffin (1) is also adjustable or flexible. If at any time only four, three, two or even one main box is required instead of five, the required number of boxes can be used and covered by top and bottom covers. Therefore, if a person has purchased a five compartments tiffin, he or she will not require to purchase any other tiffin due to adjustability of the tiffin (1) of this invention, <br>
as per requirement. The tiffin (1) is quite sleek, strong and <br>
steady and is very easy to assemble and disassmble. It is also<br>
 very simple &amp; easy for mass manufacturing. The outer surfaces<br>
 of plastic material can be provided with any desired colours, <br>
prints or designs to give a pleasant look. The above description with reference to drawings is given just to understand the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br>
