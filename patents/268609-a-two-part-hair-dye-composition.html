				<td>DESCRIPTION TWO-PART HAIRDYE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a two-part hair dye composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
While liquid or creamy hair dye compositions have been widely used so far, it is difficult to apply these compositions to the head hair evenly. In particular, in the case of consumers themselves applying a hair dye composition to their own head hair at the roots or on the back of the head, they need to acquire skills of "blocking" or using two mirrors facing each other ("two-mirror technique"), or the like, and a careful operation is required to apply the composition evenly.<br>
[0003]<br>
Accordingly, discharging a composition as foam in order to simplify the hair dyeing operation has been proposed, and hair dyes of a two-part aerosol type and those of a one-part non-aerosol type, for example, are known. However, those of a two-part aerosol type have some problems: for example, uneven bleaching or uneven dyeing<br>
is likely to occur due to an inconsistent mixing ratio of a first part and a second part, a pressure-proof metal container or the like is oxidized and corroded by hydrogen peroxide, and the internal pressure of the pressure-tight container is excessively increased by degradation of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, since such a one-part non-aerosol type has no or weak bleaching ability, it is difficult to achieve a great change in the color tone by one time procedure. Therefore, a problem arises, i.e., a hair dyeing operation tends to be cumbersome since a hair dye is required to be left to develop for a long time and the procedure is required to be repeated after application. [0004]<br>
On the other hand, discharging a two-part hair dye composition as foam from a non-aerosol type foamer container (e.g.. Patent Documents 1 and 2) has been proposed. By discharging a mixture solution of a first part and a second part from a foamer container as foam, variation in the mixing ratio hardly occurs compared to conventional two-part aerosol hair dyes and a sufficient bleaching or hair dyeing ability may be obtained compared to conventional one-part non-aerosol hair dyes. [0005]<br>

[Patent Document 2] JP-A-2006-124279<br>
Summary of the Invention [0006]<br>
Thepresent inventionprovides a two-part hair dye composition, including a first part containing an alkali agent, a second part containing hydrogen peroxide, and a non-aerosol type foamer container for discharging a mixture solution of the first part and the second part as foam, wherein the mixture solution contains the following components (A) and (B):<br>
(A)	0.1 to 10% by mass of a nonionic surfactant, and<br>
(B)	0.1 to 5% by mass of a cationic surfactant,<br>
and a mass ratio of the component (A) to the component (B) (a content of the component (A)/a content of the component (B)) is 1 to 100. [0007]<br>
Further, the present invention provides a head hair dyeing method, including:<br>
discharging the mixture solution of the two-part hair dye composition described above as foam from a non-aerosol type foamer container,-applying the foam to a head hair; and then re-foaming on the head hair.<br>

Detailed description of the Invention [0010]<br>
The present invention relates to a foam type two-part hair dye composition which is easily applied to the head hair and has a high conditioning effect while maintaining features of the Patent Document 1. [0011]<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that the above-mentioned object can be achieved by incorporating a nonionic<br>
surfactant and a cationic surfactant at a given proportion into a mixture solution of the first part and the second part of the two-part non-aerosol type hair dye composition. [0012]<br>
According to the present invention, the mixture solution of the two-part hair dye composition is discharged as foam, can be applied evenly and simply to the head hair, and exhibits a high conditioning effect. Further, the foam of the discharged mixture solution causes no liquid dripping after the application to the head hair. In addition, the foam does not cause irritation to the scalp and spattering of the agent, and has sufficient bleaching or dyeing performance . Therefore, the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention can achieve a uniform and more even bleaching finish or hair dyeing finish in a simple and comfort manner. [0013]<br>
Further, the mixture solution discharged as foam by gas-liquid mixing using a non-aerosol type foamer container easily reaches the roots of the head hair, and the mixture solution spreads throughout the head hair to form an appropriate thin layer without forming liquid accumulation or the like at the site. Thus, the root portions do not become extremely bright, and there are no uneven bleaching and uneven dyeing due to the uneven adhesion amount of the mixture solution as frequently seen in cases of using conventional compositions such as a liquid or cream form. Accordingly, through<br>
application of the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention to the head hair in the vicinity of newly growing areas such as the parting and face line, any color difference between newly growing areas and already dyed areas may also be avoided to provide a natural finish. Further, because the mixture solution may be applied to the head hair in an appropriate amount, damages to the head hair may be reduced.<br>
[0014]<br>
[Definition]<br>
In the present invention, the head hair refers to the hair grown on the head, and the concept thereof does not include the hair separate from the head such as a wig and a tress.  Furthermore, the head hair may be the hair of a doll or any animal, but human head hair is preferred.<br>

preferably 3 to 50, and even more preferably 5 to 25.<br>
[0030]<br>
When the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention is used for dyeing the head hair, the first part contains an oxidation dye or a direct dye. As a surfactant that is incorporated in the first part in order to dissolve these dyes, a nonionic surfactant<br>
of the component (A) is preferred to be mainly used, in view of the high ionic strength of the first part due to ammonia or carbonate contained in the first part. [0031] [(C): Higher alcohol]<br>
In order to improve foam-holding property and to enhance an effect of suppressing liquid dripping during being left to stand after the application to the head hair, the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention may further contain, as a component (C) , a higher alcohol. Higher alcohols preferably include analkyl or alkenyl group having 10 to 3 0 carbon atoms, more preferably 12 to 24 carbon atoms, even more preferably 14 to 22.

The content of the component (C) in the mixture solution of the first part and the second part is preferably 0.01 to 0.8% by mass, more preferably 0.1 to 0.7% by mass, and even more preferably 0.2 to 0 .6% by mass from viewpoints<br>
that foaming property is not inhibited at a low solution temperature,<br>
and that the effect of preventing dripping during the foam being<br>
left to develop is improved.<br>
[0033]<br>
[(D): Dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride-acrylamide copolymer]<br>
In order to improve an effect of preventing liquid dripping, the two-part hair dye composition of the present invent ion may further contain, as a component (D) , a dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride-acrylamide copolymer (INCI name: Polyquaternium-7). For example, commercially available products such as Merquat 550 (Nalco Company) may be used as the component (D). [0034]<br>
The content of the component (D) in the mixture solution of the first part and the second part is preferably 0.01 to 3% by mass, more preferably 0.1 to 1% by mass, and even more preferably 0.2 to 0 . 5% by mass in order to achieve satisfactory foaming which allows easiness of application to the head hair even when the liquid temperature is low or is close to normal temperature, as well as to provide an effect for preventing liquid dripping during a period from the time of application of the mixture solution to the time of washing away thereof from the hair. [0035] [(E): Dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride-acrylic acid copolymer]<br>
In order to control antif oaming property after the application<br>
to the hair, maintain appropriate foam duration, and facilitate the confirmation of an applied portion, the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention may further contain, as a component (E) , a dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride-acrylic acid copolymer (INCI name: Polyquaternium-22). For example, commercially available products such as Merquat 280 and Merquat 2 95 (manufactured by Nalco Company) may be used as the component<br>
(E) .<br>
[0036]<br>
The content of the component (E) in the mixture solution of the first part and the second part is preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by mass, and more preferably 0 .1 to 0 .2% by mass so that the foamability would not be inhibited at low liquid temperature and the above-mentioned effect would be obtained.<br>
[0037]<br>
[(F): Nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent]<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable to add a nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent to the first part or the second part. Consequently, irritation on the scalp may be reduced which occurs because water is evaporated from the two-part hair dye composition while leaving to develop after application of the two-part hair dye composition to the head hair, and therefore irritating components such as hydrogen peroxide are concentrated. Preferred examples of the nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent include substances without a defoaming action<br>
such as polyols and lower alkyl ethers (having 1 to 4 carbon atoms) derived therefrom. Polyols having 2 to 6 carbon atoms are preferred, and examples thereof include glycerin, diglycerin, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, isoprene glycol, and sorbitol. Examples of lower alkyl ether derived from polyol include mono-lower alkyl ethers and poly-lower alkyl ethers derived from the above-mentioned polyols (e.g., di-lower alkyl ether) . Of these, mono-methyl ether and mono-ethyl ether derived from polyols are preferred, and specific examples thereof include ethylene glycol mono-methyl ether, ethylene glycol mono-ethyl ether,  diethylene glycol mono-methyl ether,  and diethylene glycol mono-ethyl ether. Two or more thereof may be used in combination. [0038]<br>
The content of the nonvolatile hydrophilic solvent in the mixture solution of the first part and the second part is preferably 0.01 to 5% by mass, more preferably 0.1 to 4% by mass, and even more preferably 0.2 to 3% by mass, from viewpoints that irritation of the scalp is reduced, and that favorable foam quality is maintained even at a low solution temperature. [0039] [Dye]<br>
The two-part hair dye composition of the present invention may be used for bleaching of the head hair when a dye is not contained<br>
in the mixture solution of the first part and the second part, and<br>
also may be used for hair dyeing by containing an oxidative dye<br>
or a direct dye. When the composition is used for hair dyeing, the<br>
first part contains an oxidative dye or a direct dye. Examples of<br>
the oxidative dye include dye precursors such as p-phenylenediamine,<br>
toluene-2,5-diamine,	o-chloro-p-phenylenediamine,<br>
N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, N,N-bis(hydroxyethyl)-p-phenylenediamine,<br>
3-methyl-4-aminophenol, 2-hydroxyethyl-p-phenylenediamine, p-aminophenol, p-methylaminophenol, 4-amino-m-cresol, o-aminophenol, 1-hydroxyethyl-4,5-diaminopyrazole, and salts thereof; and couplers such as resorcin, 2-methylresorcin, 1-naphthol, 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene , 5-amino-o-cresol, m-phenylenediamine, m-aminophenol, 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol, 2,6-diaminopyridine, 2-methyl-5-hydroxyethylaminophenol, 2-amino-3-hydroxypyridine, and salts thereof. [0040]<br>
Examples of the direct dye include basic dyes, nitro dyes,<br>
dispersive dyes, and cationic dyes. More specific examples thereof<br>
include	2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine,<br>
2-amino-6 -chloro-4-nitrophenol,<br>
3-nitro-p-hydroxyethylaminophenol, 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, 4-amino-3-nitrophenol, 4-hydroxypropylamino-3-nitrophenol, HC Blue 2, HC Orange 1, HC Red 1, HC Yellow 2, HC Yellow 4, HC Yellow<br><br>
5, HC Red 3, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine, Disperse Violet 1, Disperse Blue 1, Disperse Black 9, Basic Blue 99, Basic Brown 16, Basic Brown 17, Basic Red 76, Basic Yellow 76, Basic Orange 31, and Basic Red 51.<br>
[0041]<br>
[Silicones]<br>
The mixture solution of the first part and the second part of the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention is preferably free of silicones, from the standpoint that a discharged foam is maintained for a long period of time. However, silicone may be added to a certain extent to work the foam into the head hair smoothly and exert a high conditioning effect on the head hair. Examples of the silicones include dimethylpolysiloxane, methylphenylpolysiloxane, polyether-modifled silicone, amino-modif led silicone, and oxazoline-modif led silicone elastomer, and emulsion obtained by dispersing these silicones in water using surfactants. Of these, polyether-modified silicone, amino-modifled silicone, and emulsion thereof are preferred, from a viewpoint that a stable dispersion in water is enabled without using a thickening agent.<br>
[0042]<br>
The polyether-modified silicone includes terminal-modified or side chain-modified silicones, for example, pendant type (comb type) silicones, silicones of which both terminals are modified,<br>
and silicones of which one terminal is modified. Examples of the above-mentioned modified silicone include a dimethylsiloxane-methyl(polyoxyethylene)siloxane copolymer, a dimethylsiloxane-methyl (polyoxypropylene) siloxane copolymer, and a dimethylsiloxane-methyl(polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene) siloxane copolymer. Thepolyether-modified silicone preferably has an HLB of 10 or more, and more preferably has an HLB of 10 to 18 in terms of compatibility with water. Herein, the HLB is a value determined by a cloud number (cloud number: an index having a correlation with an HLB, the indexbeing applied to ether type nonionic surfactants). [0043]<br>
An amino-modified silicone having an amino group or an ammonium group may be used as the amino-modif ied silicone,  and an amodimethicone is preferred. [0044]<br>
When silicones are used for the above-described purpose, the<br>
content of the silicones in the mixture solution of the first part<br>
and the second part is preferably 0 . 01 to 0 . 5% by mass, more preferably<br>
0.02 to 0.4% by mass, even more preferably 0.05 to 0.3% by mass.<br>
[0045]<br>
[Other components]<br>
In addition, depending on the purposes, fragrance, ultraviolet absorber, metal sequestering agent such as EDTA, disinfectant.<br>
preservative such as methyl paraoxybenzoate, stabilizer such as fenasetin, etidronicacid, andoxyquinoline sulfate, organic solvent suchas ethanol, benzyl alcohol, andbenzyloxyethanol, water-soluble polymer such as polyquaternium-6, polyquaternium-3 9, and hydroxyethylcellulose, moisturizing agent and the like maybe added to the first part and the second part. Furthermore, using water as the main medium in the mixture solution of the first part and second part is preferable.<br>
[0046]<br>
It should be noted that a persulfate salt such as ammonium persulfate may be incorporated as a third part into the mixture solution in order to further enhance a bleaching effect.<br>
[0047]<br>
[Viscosity]<br>
The viscosity of the first part (25°C) is preferably 1 to 50 mPa•s, more preferably 3 to 4 0 mPa•s, even more preferably 5 to 3 0 mPa•s. The viscosity of the second part (25°C) is preferably 1 to 300 mPa•s, more preferably 3 to 200 mPa•s, even more preferably 5 to 100 mPa•s. The viscosity of the mixture solution of the first part and the second part (25°C) is 1 to 100 mPa•s, preferably 3 to 50 mPa•s, more preferably 5 to 30 mPa•s. The value of viscosity is defined as a value obtained after rotating Rotor No. 1 of Type B Rotational Viscometer (model TV.10) produced by Tokimec Inc. for 1 minute. Measurement is performed at 60 rpm for 100 mPa•s or lower,<br>
3 0 rpm for 10 0 to 200 mPa•s, and 12 rpm for 200 to 500 mPa•s. By adjusting the viscosity of the mixture solution within the above-mentioned range, the mixture solution may be mixed uniformly without foaming and easily applied to the head hair, foam is well worked into the head hair, and uniform foam that hardly drips after application to the head hair may be obtained.<br>
[0048]<br>
By adjusting the viscosity within the above-mentioned range, quality of foam that may be easily applied to and worked into the head hair may be provided, foam may be prevented from dripping down after application to the head hair, and foam may be easily discharged using a non-aerosol type foamer. In order to adjust viscosity to fall within the above-mentioned range, water-soluble solvents such as ethanol may be added, or contents and types of surfactant, polyols, higher alcohol, and the like may be suitably adjusted.<br>
[0049]<br>
[Gas-liquid mixing ratio]<br>
The gas-liquid mixing ratio of air in foam discharged using a foamer container to the mixture solution is preferably 10 to 50 mL/g, more preferably 15 to 4 0 mL/g, even more preferably 2 0 to 30 mL/g, from viewpoints that the compositions may be easily applied to and worked into the head hair. It is noted that the gas-liquid mixing ratio here is a value measured as follows.<br>
[0050]<br>
The gas-liquid mixing ratio is calculated by measuring the mass and the volume of foam discharged at 25°C. Specifically, 100 g of the mixture solution is placed in a foamer container, 20 g of foam is discharged into a 1000 mL measuring cylinder, the volume of the foam is measured at 1 minute after the start of discharge. The gas-liquid mixing ratio (mL/g) is obtained by dividing the volume<br>
(mL) of this discharged foam by 20 g, the mass thereof.<br>
[0051]<br>
[Foamer container]<br>
In the present invention, the foamer container is a non-aerosol type container and is used to mix a first part and a second part or a mixture solution thereof with air and discharge them as foam without using a propellant. Use of the foamer container can also prevent the discharged compositions from spattering. In particular, a non-aerosol type container can be manufactured at low costs than an aerosol type container, the discharging rate can be easily adjusted, the container can be re-used by performing a certain treatment, and products can be handled more safely during distribution since no high-pressure gas propellant is required.<br>
[0052]<br>
Any container may be used as the foamer container so long as it is a non-aerosol type container having a foam discharging means such as a known pump foamer container or squeeze foamer container having a foam discharging means.<br>
[0053]<br>
The pump foamer container or the squeeze foamer container has a foam generating portion such as a net, and preferably has a thin net, from a viewpoint that, when a mixture solution of the first part and the second part is solidified to dryness causing clogging, the solids can be immediately dissolved by the flow of foam at the next discharge, resulting in resolution of clogging.  In this case, the net preferably has a 50 to 280 mesh, more preferably a 90 to 250 mesh, and even more preferably a 130 to 220 mesh.  Creamy foam can be produced by using a net mesh in this range.  Furthermore, preferred examples of materials of such a mesh include nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, teflon (registered trade name), carbon fiber, stainless, and so forth.  Of these, nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyester are more preferred, and nylon is even more preferred.<br>
[0054]<br>
In the foamer container used in the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention, at least one, preferably two or more of such nets are disposed. More preferably, two nets are disposed from viewpoints of economic efficiency, foam stability, and the like. In this case, a mesh through which the solution passes first is preferably as coarse as or coarser than a mesh through which the solution passes next.<br>
[0055]<br>
In the foamer container, a portion in contact with the contents<br>
(e.g., inner wall of a container, inner wall of a foam discharging<br>
means, etc.) is preferably constituted by materials that are not<br>
corroded by alkalis or hydrogen peroxide and are able to pass oxygen<br>
generated by degradation of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0056]<br>
As a product form used in the two-part hair dye composition used in the present invention containing a first part, a second part and a foamer container, the first part and the second part may be filled in respective containers separate from the foamer container, so that both the parts should be transferred to the foamer container andmixedbef ore use . Alternatively, onepart maybe filled in the foamer container, and the other part maybe filled in a separate container, so that the other part should be transferred into the foamer container before use. In this case, the second part is preferably filled in a foamer container composed of a container having gas permeability to prevent the increase of a pressure in the container due to oxygen generated by degradation of hydrogen peroxide, and more preferably filled in a foamer container made of a material having oxygen permeability (e.g., polypropylene or polyethylene). On the other hand, a container that hardly passes oxygen is required to be used for the first part to prevent oxidation of an oxidative dye. [0057]<br>
[Head hair dyeing method]<br>
In order to dye the head hair with the two-part hair dye composition of the present invention, preferably, the mixture solution of the first part and the second part is discharged as foam from a non-aerosol type foamer container, the form is applied to the head hair, then the mixture solution is re-foamed on the head hair, and the foam is washed away after about 3 to 6 0 minutes, and preferably about 5 to 45 minutes from the application. [0058]<br>
A two-part hair dye composition is used for hair dyeing treatment by mixing a first part and a second part immediately before use. In the present invention, the first part and the second part may be mixed by any of the following procedures:<br>
1)	Mixing before filling in the main body of a foamer container;<br>
2)	Mixing in the main body of a foamer container;<br>
3)	Mixing by j oining the first part and the second part together in a gas-liquid mixing chamber of a foamer;<br>
4)	Once foaming the first part and the second part separately and then mixing by joining them together before discharging from the foamer;<br><br>
5)	Mixing separately discharged foams of the first part and the second part before applying to the head hair; or<br>
6)	Mixing separately discharged foams of the first part and the second part on the head hair.<br>
[0059]<br>
Of those, from the viev/points of allowing simplifying the structure of the foamer container, freely designing the compositions of the first part and the second part, and mixing in a reliable and uniform manner, 1) mixing is performed before being charged into the body of the foamer container, or 2) mixing is performed in the body of the foamer container, is preferred. [0060]<br>
It is preferable to comb the head hair in advance of application of discharged foam. Consequently, the hair hardly gets tangled during the re-foaming treatment, so that the hair dye composition is not likely to splatter. Furthermore, after the head hair is combed, blocking, generally performed in application of a hair dye composition, is not required, and it is preferable not to perform blocking. Consequently, the hair dye composition is easily applied to the head hair or re-foamed as described later. [0061]<br>
From viewpoints of even hair dyeing, prevention of dripping, and a sufficient hair dyeing effect, it is preferable that hair dressing is not applied to the head hair to which the hair dye composition is to be applied immediately before the hair dyeing. Furthermore, from viewpoints that the mixture solution is not diluted, even hair dyeing can be provided, dripping may be prevented and a sufficient hair dyeing effect may be obtained, dry head hair is<br>
preferred. When the hair is washed immediately before the hair dyeing treatment, it is preferable to dry the head hair before hair dyeing treatment. Drying the head hair means that the liquid, mainly water, attached due to the hair wash is removed at least to the extent that it does not drip in a spontaneous state. Specifically, it is preferable to dry the hair with a towel or a dryer. [0062]<br>
The mixture solution of the first part and the second part discharged as foam is applied to the head hair after placing it on the hands or a brush, or directly. Here, when hands are used, it is preferable to wear gloves. According to the dyeing method of the present invention, since blocking generally performed in the application of a hair dye composition is not required, the foam may be applied in a short time. Therefore, the application of foam may be started at any head hair site, and it is not necessary to apply it starting with the neckline unlike conventional liquid or creamy two-part hair dye compositions. It is sufficient to start the application at a concerned portion, and it is preferable to apply foam from the hairline of the head hair or a site where the hair is parted. [0063]<br>
It is preferable to discharge foam in about the size of a lemon because it is the proper size to place on one hand and to easily apply to the head hair using hands .  In this case, foam is discharged<br>
with one hand and received with the other hand. Then, after foam received on the hand is once applied to the head hair, foam is discharged on the hand again to repeat the application to the head hair. This series of operations may be performed very conveniently in a short period.<br>
[0064]<br>
Furthermore, foam may be applied to the whole head hair or only a specific portion.<br>
[0065]<br>
Then, the applied foam is re-foamed on the head hair. The foam may be re-foamed by injecting a gas, using an instrument such as a vibrator or a brush, or with fingers . However, since the two-part hair dye composition may be thoroughly spread to the roots of the head hair, it is more preferable to use fingers . The rate of foaming using a vibrator or a brush or with fingers is preferably controlled so that the foam should not spatter.<br>
[0066]<br>
Here, the timing of re-foaming may be after the foam has disappeared completely, during the process of disappearance, or before the applied foam changes. Alternatively, the timing may be after the foam has been completely applied to the area that needs applying the foam or during the process of application. Re-foaming may be performed continuously once or intermittently in several times. Here, when a vibrator, abrush, or fingers used for re-foaming<br>
remain in contact with a part of the head hair, or they are brought into contact within 1 second even if they are once separated, the re-foaming is assumed as continuous. In short, it is sufficient to observe the applied site and suitably foam at least before liquid drips from the applied foam. Irrespective of the property of the foam, dripping may be prevented by re-foaming the foam that almost disappears. Furthermore, by re-foaming, foam may be changed to the quality suitable for hair dyeing regardless of differences in the structure of the f oamer container or the property of the foam depending on the composition of the two-part hair dye composition. In some cases, dripping may be prevented, and the foam quality suitable for hair dyeing may be maintained as it is by using a specific structure of the foamer container or a specific composition of the two-part hair dye composition. Even in such cases, however, it is preferable to perform re-foaming at least once as early as possible after the completion of the foam application. By performing re-foaming at an early stage, uneven coloring in an area that needs applying may be prevented. This timing is preferably within 5 minutes after the completion of application of the discharged foam to the head hair, more preferably within 3 minutes, even more preferably within 1 minute. [0067]<br>
Hereafter, specific examples of preferred procedures in the processes from discharge of foam to application to the head hair<br>
and re-foaming will be shown according to partial hair dyeing and whole head hair dyeing. [0068] [Partial hair dyeing]<br>
1)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, apply the foam to a part of the head hair, andperform one operation of re-foaming over 1 second to 10 minutes, preferably 3 seconds to 3 minutes.<br>
2)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, apply the foam to a part of the head hair, perform one operation of re-foaming over 1 second to 10 minutes, preferably 3 seconds to 3 minutes, and repeat the operation 2 to 30 times. Re-foaming is performed over a total of 2 seconds to 20 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 5 minutes.<br>
[0069]<br>
[Whole head hair dyeing]<br>
3)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, apply the foam to a part of the head hair, and perform one operation of re-foaming over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes. Repeat this operation to apply the foam over the whole head.<br>
4)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, apply the foam toapart of the headhair, and perform one operationof re-foaming over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes. Repeat this operation to apply the foam over the whole head, and then perform one operation of re-foaming over 3 seconds to 10 minutes.<br>
preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes. Further, discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, additionally apply the foam to a part of the head hair, and perform one operation of re-foaming over the whole head over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes.<br>
5)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, apply the foam to a part of the head hair, and perform one operation of re-foaming over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes. Repeat this operation to apply the foam over the whole head. After completion of the application to the whole head, perform one operation of re-foaming over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 5 minutes.<br>
6)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on one hand, apply the foam to a part of the head hair, and perform one operation of re-foaming over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes. Repeat this operation to apply the foam over the whole head. After completion of the application to the whole head, perform one operation of re-foaming over the whole head over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes, and repeat the operation 2 to 30 times. Re-foaming is performed over a total of 6 seconds to 20 minutes, preferably 10 seconds to 5 minutes.<br>
7)	Discharge a suitable amount of foam on a brush, and apply the foam to a part of the head hair. Repeat this operation to apply the foam over the whole head, and perform one operation of re-foaming<br>
over the whole head using the same brush over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 5 minutes.<br>
8) Discharge a suitable amount of foam on a brush, apply the foam to a part of the head hair, and per form one operation of re-foaming using the same brush or hands over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 3 minutes. Repeat this operation to apply the foam over the whole head. After completion of application to the whole head, perform one operation of re-foaming using the same brush or hands over 3 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 5 minutes . [0070]<br>
The area for re-foaming may be the whole head hair or only a specific portion. Since foammaybe thoroughly spread by per forming re-foaming over the whole head hair, incomplete dyeing may be prevented even if application of foam is missed at a site that may be hardly checked, such as the hair in back of the head. In partial dyeing, when re-foaming is performed on only a specific portion, the border of a dyedportion may be made unclear, and natural finishing is provided. Furthermore, when re-foaming is performed, it is very easy to visually check portions where foam has spread. Therefore, incomplete dyeing of a portion that needs dyeing may be avoided. [0071]<br>
After completion of the foam application, the hair is washed after the foam is left for about 3 to 60 minutes, preferably about 5 to 45 minutes .  In the present invention, the above-mentioned time<br>
after completion of the foam application means all the required time from completion of application of all the foam to the whole head or a desired portion to rinsing out, and is a concept including time required for re-foaming in addition to the time for simply-leaving the hair. Then, the hair is suitably washed with a shampoo or treated with a conditioner, then rinsed with water, and dried.<br>
