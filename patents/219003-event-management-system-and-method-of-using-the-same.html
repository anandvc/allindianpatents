				<td>EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
OF USING THE SAME<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of event management systems, in<br>
particular to dynamic correlation of events.<br>
Background Information<br>
Information technology (IT) has evolved from mainframe-only computing to<br>
complex, highly distributed computer systems spanning across desktops and<br>
departments through networks. These distributed computing environments provide<br>
benefits, including the flexibility to select any number of platforms, domains, tools, and<br>
network configurations. The distributed environments, however, may be complex.<br>
Further, there may exist a lack of compatibility and integration between software tools<br>
and platforms. For example, conventional point products (e.g., the Platinum DBVision<br>
product manufactured by Platinum technology, inc. of Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois) are<br>
generally directed to a specific function or area of expertise such as a solution for<br>
database monitoring and management, job scheduling, or managing database<br>
reorganizations. Each point product provides a specific capability and each also<br>
includes a distinct interface. On the other hand, utilizing framework technology<br>
provides an integrated solution, although tool functionality is significantly sacrificed, Further, maintaining the current enterprise environment utilizing either conventional<br>
point products or framework technology involves a large amount of resources and<br>
money from IT organizations.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for an integrated system for providing tools that<br>
utilize a compatible interface without significantly sacrificing tool functionality.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is providing an integrated system for<br>
monitoring events occurring in point products through a common event management<br>
system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the dynamic correlation of events<br>
across nodes of an enterprise.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to dynamically execute a<br>
changed rule and/or a newly added rule for event correlation.<br>
An aspect of the present invention provides an event management system<br>
including an event manager, an alarm rule store, an event correlator, and a response<br>
engine. The event manager receives and distributes event information. The event<br>
correlator correlates event information provided by an event manager based on alarm<br>
rules which are stored in an alarm rule store. The response engine executes a response<br>
policy based on the correlation of events by the event correlator.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for dynamically<br>
executing a modified rule or a new rule for event correlation. The method further<br>
includes comparing a first rule set to a second rule set to identify modifications,<br>
additions, or deletions of rules and dynamically executing all of the respective rules that<br>
have been modified or added.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The event management system of the present invention manages an enterprise<br>
(e.g., a computer network such as a local area network (LAN) or wide area network<br>
(WAN)), correlates event information occurring in the enterprise, and takes corrective<br>
actions based on predetermined response policies. The event management system<br>
receives, for example, event messages from compatible point products within the<br>
enterprise. As shown in FIG. 1, the enterprise 100 may include a plurality of nodes<br>
110, 120, 130 which may, for example, be connected by a network (not shown). A<br>
node is, for example, a physical box such as a personal computer, server, etc. that runs<br>
an operating system. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a node<br>
may be a personal computer having a compatible point product installed on it. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the event management system 140<br>
manages events on the nodes 110, 120, 130 where the events are generated, minimizing<br>
the movement of data on the network and keeping actions such as evaluation, reporting<br>
and automated correction of data close to the source.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG. 2, the<br>
event management system 270 may be included in a suite 200 of integrated tools<br>
including compatible point products used to, for example, manage applications,<br>
databases, desktops, networks, and systems. The tools 230, 240, 250, 260 may use a set<br>
of common services 210 to share data relating to events. A director 220 is, for<br>
example, a shared, common graphical user interface (GUI) running in a conventional<br>
server computer for compatible point products 230, 240, 250, 260. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the director 220 runs under Windows NT and<br>
Windows 95, and operates as a single console that allows users to view and interact<br>
with all resources including compatible point products 230, 240, 250, 260 in the<br>
enterprise.<br>
The primary manageable unit of information utilized by the event management<br>
system of the present invention is a structured message called an event. An event<br>
represents information about some significant occurrence by or to a resource in the<br>
enterprise. Events are sent and received by compatible point products and event<br>
managers in the event management system. Events are, for example, the basic building<br>
blocks of real-time information processing used to manage the enterprise. Events<br>
define the fundamental element of publishable, sharable information and the format in<br>
which the events should be maintained and transmitted. The structure of an event<br>
includes, for example, predefined fields for the fundamental information necessary for<br>
any event record. The predetermined fields fall into two categories: identifying fields<br>
and non-identifying fields. Identifying fields are fields that taken together form a<br>
unique key for the event, distinguishing it from another event. Non-identifying fields<br>
are fields that add additional information about an event but do not participate in the<br>
key of the event. The event management system of the present invention allows the<br>
event structure to be extended by a user by dynamically adding key value pairs and<br>
thus, uniquely defining the respective event structure. Accordingly, the addition of key<br>
value pairs to an event structure enables a point product to publish the uniquely-defined<br>
5 event that otherwise would not have been published because it would not have been<br>
uniquely defined by the predetermined fields of the event.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of an event structure according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is defined below, for example, in the C language.<br>
The identifying fields of the exemplary event are node, name, product, instance,<br>
type, condition_time if the type is not discrete, event time if the type is discrete, all key<br>
value pairs including the contents of the keys field array and values field array (with the<br>
field, for example NumKeys, including a number indicating the number of key value<br>
pairs in their respective field arrays). All of the other predefined fields are non-<br>
identifying fields.<br>
The events may be categorized into a plurality of types including, for example,<br>
discrete events, conditions and alarms. Discrete events are events which indicate that<br>
something occurred at a particular time and are completely self-contained. The<br>
occurrence for a discrete event has no state and does not get updated. A failed logon<br>
attempt, for example, may invoke the generation of a discrete event. Conditions are<br>
events that indicate the state of something that is persistent over a period of time and<br>
may have attributes that are updated. The events declared by a product are owned by<br>
that product. Generally, only the respective point product can update or clear the<br>
condition events generated at the point product. The contents of discrete and condition<br>
events represent real information about the enterprise that cannot be changed without<br>
changing the occurrence that causes the event. An alarm is, for example, an<br>
interpretation of other events based on a user configurable policy. Accordingly, the<br>
user could clear an alarm at anytime without resolving the condition that caused it.<br>
Similarly, the alarm can persist beyond the clearing of an event upon which the alarm is<br>
based.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, an exemplary embodiment of an event management system<br>
300 of the present invention includes an event manager 310, event archive 320, event<br>
correlator 330, alarm rule store 340, and a response engine 350. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, an event manager 310, event archive 320, event<br>
correlator 330, and a response engine 350 are included on all nodes of the enterprise<br>
and the alarm rule store 340 is included on a central node allowing events to be stored<br>
and managed locally.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an event management<br>
system may, for example, receive event messages from point products, for example,<br>
throughout an enterprise. Events are managed on a node of the enterprise where the<br>
events are received by an event manager 310 located on the respective node. The event<br>
manager 310 may, for example, receive all events, maintain the states of previously<br>
sent events, maintain a list of subscriptions, and route events to the appropriate<br>
subscribers. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the events and their<br>
state and the list of subscriptions may be stored locally.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the event manager 402 of node A401 and the event manager<br>
411 of node B410 also receive event information from the event correlator 413 of node<br>
B410. The event manager 411 of node B410 also provides events to the event<br>
correlator 413 on node b. The event manager 411 also receives event information from<br>
point product 415, where events are actually occurring. Event manager 402, 411<br>
maintains, for example, the events and their associated state and a list of subscriptions.<br>
Each event manager may have a local memory data store, e.g., a blackboard, where<br>
statefull events are stored. The blackboard may be kept persistent in a file based<br>
storage for recovery of the information across generations (process invocation of the<br>
event manager). The clients subscribing to events are responsible for reestablishing the<br>
respective subscriptions across new invocations of the event manager. Accordingly,<br>
the subscriptions may be maintained in memory. The local event archive is maintained<br>
for all the events received by the event manager. The event management system of the<br>
present invention also may correlate events from multiple nodes. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the event management system provides views of<br>
events consolidated to single management stations or in views/categories that cross<br>
node boundaries.<br>
The event management system of the present invention is structured to query or<br>
express outstanding interest in groups of events by criteria other than node through, for<br>
example, event subscription. Event subscription allows the specification of criteria on<br>
the contents of the fields of the event. Determining the events of interest to a particular<br>
process can be analogized, for example, to writing a database query that requests<br>
records matching criteria on various fields of the record. The request of the present<br>
invention differs from a normal database query in that it is not solely a request for data<br>
already in existence, but an ongoing request for a collection of events that have yet to<br>
occur or exist.<br>
When a subscription is made for an event such as, for example, an event<br>
occurring at a point product 415, a subscription request is sent to event manager 411 on<br>
node B410. The event manager 411 receives the request and adds this request to its list<br>
of outstanding requests which may be stored, for example, in memory. The event<br>
manager 411 checks outstanding events previously stored, for example, in a<br>
blackboard, to see if it matches the request criteria. Each matching event is forwarded,<br>
e.g., published, to the requestor, e.g., the subscriber of the event. Any new events<br>
which are received and match the subscription criteria are also forwarded. This may<br>
continue until the subscription is canceled.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a subscription is assigned<br>
a unique ID when it is formed. The unique ID and a datagroup from which this request<br>
came, uniquely defines the subscription. A subscription is canceled by calling an API<br>
with a returned request handle from the original subscription. This results in sending a<br>
cancel message to the event manager with the respective request ID. The event<br>
manager can then match the cancel request to the original subscription and remove it<br>
from a processing queue of the event manager.<br>
All events published on a node are received by the event manager of the node.<br>
The event manager also receives and maintains all requests sent by processes from its<br>
node and other nodes. Upon receipt of an event, the event manager also assigns an<br>
event ID. The event manager determines if the event is a condition and if so, the event<br>
manager checks, for example, a blackboard to determine if the event matches an<br>
existing condition. If so, the condition event is assigned a condition ID of the existing<br>
condition and applied as an update to the existing condition. Further, if archiving is<br>
enabled, the event is archived. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention,<br>
for example, the archiving may include storing the event in a database such as a flat file<br>
archive. A separate file may be used for each calendar day. Events may be written to<br>
the archive for the day of the time stamp in the event as newline delimited records in<br>
the order in which they are received. The event manager also checks all outstanding<br>
subscription requests. For any event other than a condition update, if the received event<br>
matches the request, the event manager forwards the event to the requestor. In the case<br>
of an update to a condition, it is the event as updated that is matched against the<br>
request. Accordingly, it is the updated event that the event manager forwards to the<br>
requestor.<br>
Event filters describe identifying criteria for the events of interest and allow<br>
specification of various forms of comparison that can be specified for each of the fields<br>
of an event including key value pairs of the extended event structure. An event filter is,<br>
for example, a Boolean expression made up of subexpressions that compare a field of<br>
an event with a user specified value. Event filters are, for example, similar to the<br>
"WHERE" clause in Structured Query Language (SQL). The fundamental<br>
subexpression of an event filter is, for example, a phrase comparing a field of an event<br>
with a value, e.g., node=ptisun20. The subexpression node=ptisun20 means that the<br>
node field of the event must exactly match the string "ptisun20". Any of the fields of<br>
the event structure can be used as the node field is used in the example, with the<br>
exception of the keys field array and values field array which require a special syntax.<br>
For example, if one of the key value pairs added was:<br>
key value<br>
FileSystem /usr,<br>
an exact match filter for this key value pair would be<br>
keyfield.FileSystem = "/usr". Further, testing for the existence of a key with any value<br>
could be done by testing that it not match a null value, e.g., keyfield.FileSystem != "?.<br>
The event filters may be stored any place a text string could be stored, for example, in a<br>
configuration file such as a flat text file, in a database, in memory, as C source code<br>
(e.g., hard coded in a program), etc.<br>
Filtering is also available on the values of key value pairs of the event. As in<br>
the earlier example, there may be a key "FileSystem" with an associated value that is<br>
the name of a specific file system. The desired events may only be those for a certain<br>
file system, for instance /usr. The filter mechanism for corresponding values of a key<br>
specifies the key and tests the associated value. A special syntax is used to distinguish<br>
keys from other fields of the event that allows a different name space for the keys from<br>
the predefined fields of the event. The syntax is "keyfield.[name]". An example<br>
testing for the value /usr of a key value pair would be, for example, keyfield.FileSystem<br>
= /usr. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the event filter<br>
may include comparison operators such as = and full regular expression match<br>
specified with the operator "like". A filter, for example, could be node=ptisun05. A<br>
filter matching all node values that follow a pattern of ptisun[#] would be<br>
node like "ptisun[0-9]+". The following is an exemplary list of event filter comparison<br>
operators: &gt;= (greater than or equal),  (greater than), 
than), = (equal), like (matches a regular expression), likeci (case insensitive string<br>
match), and != (not equal).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the following tokens,<br>

In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the event manager 411<br>
may be implemented as a daemon (e.g., an agent program that continuously operates on<br>
a UNIX server and provides resources to client systems on the network). Upon<br>
receiving an event, the event manager 411 determines the disposition of the event,<br>
including whether it has already received the event and whether the event state has<br>
changed. The event manager 411 also writes the event to a local event archive 412 and<br>
routes the event to all clients that subscribe to the event content. For example, the<br>
event manager 411 may provide event information to the event correlator 413 and the<br>
event manager on a node 402. The event archive 412 may include an event archive<br>
service processor. The event archive 412 service processor reads events from the event<br>
archive. Subscribers may include any event correlator 413 instance that has an alarm<br>
rule subscribing to the event and, for example, a director containing a resource object or<br>
a product subscribing to update events about the contents in a central storage such as a<br>
data exchange service (DEX).<br>
The event correlator 413 may include, for example, an event correlator service<br>
processor. The event correlator 413 implements a user-policy specified in a correlation<br>
rule. An alarm is a type of event that provides notification to subscribers of a<br>
significant condition or occurrence. The determination of an alarm may include the<br>
presence of a single event, the presence of a certain existing state(s) when another event<br>
occurs, or the recurrence of a particular event within a fixed time window. Further, an<br>
alarm may be a combination of the recurrence of a particular event within a fixed time<br>
window when certain state or states are present.<br>
The events that determine if an alarm occurs may be due to events on the same<br>
node as the event correlator 413 or may come from one or more other nodes 401, 410.<br>
An alarm may also be associated with an automated response policy on declaration<br>
allowing a response engine 414 to handle any automated notification or correction of<br>
the alarm. The event correlator 413 can create, for example, an alarm, a modified<br>
version of a received event, or an entirely new event that can be correlated by another<br>
alarm rule.<br>
Events may be correlated through an alarm rule. The basis of an alarm rule is<br>
the determination of the events that should be analyzed. Alarm rules can be created to<br>
define which single event or set of events represent a significant occurrence to which to<br>
respond. The alarm rule may include a description and logic describing the events that<br>
represent an occurrence and a definition of the response of the event management<br>
system to the occurrence. The result of correlation is the creation of one or more<br>
events. An alarm rule may be defined, for example, through the director 404.<br>
An alarm rule includes, for example, a unique name which allows the rule to be<br>
referenced in other expressions by name. An alarm rule may also include a list of<br>
nodes (e.g., a distribution list) where the rule is to be run. The distribution list for a rule<br>
may be specified, for example, by a list of the nodes that should run the rule or a query<br>
that specifies the nodes that should run the rule. The query may be, for example, "all",<br>
which equates to every node running an event correlator. Further, a query may run<br>
against a central storage such as the DEX 405 to determine certain criteria of the nodes<br>
in the enterprise, such as events available. An alarm rule also includes a definition of<br>
correlation filters.<br>
Correlation filters are similar to the event filters used in event subscription as<br>
described in copending patent applications: attorney docket number 22074661/25529,<br>
filed on December 31, 1998 and entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A USER<br>
EXTENSIBLE EVENT STRUCTURE and attorney docket number 22074661/25546,<br>
filed on December 31, 1998 and entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE<br>
DYNAMIC FILTERING AND ROUTING OF EVENTS; and Platinum Provision<br>
Common Services Reference Guide, version 1.08 (October 1998 Platinum technology,<br>
inc.) which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The correlation<br>
filters, however, may be assigned a name and include qualifiers. The qualifiers, for<br>
example, may be used to correlate multiple events in a single rule. The qualifiers may<br>
also indicate that the filter is not applicable to the current input event. The alarm rule<br>
may also include logic testing filters and updating/sending events based on the results<br>
of the test, for example if/then/else logic that allows testing Boolean combinations of<br>
the filters and performing actions that result in events being generated.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the alarm rule uses the<br>
following format:<br>
In the above-mentioned exemplary format, the correlation filter expression<br>
follows the "If statement and is enclosed in parentheses. This is a logical expression<br>
containing one or more correlation filter names connected by Boolean operators such as<br>
AND and OR. Further, additional parentheses can be included to control the order of<br>
evaluation. In the above-mentioned exemplary format, the correlation event expression<br>
is enclosed in a single set of curly braces. The beginning and ending curly brace may<br>
be on separate lines or each event definition may be on a separate line ending with a<br>
semicolon. The correlation filter expression defines what filters must be satisfied in<br>
order for the correlation to be performed. How a filter is satisfied (e.g., evaluated as<br>
true) depends on the qualification placed on the filter. For a standard filter, the current<br>
input event must match. For a count filter, the current event must complete a set of<br>
events received in a time window for the filter to be satisfied. Further, a<br>
conditionExists filter is satisfied if a given event was received in the past that indicates<br>
that a particular condition still exists. The correlation filter expression can specify<br>
criteria on a past and current event by any combination via a Boolean operator of these<br>
individual filters including the negation of it (e.g., the condition is not currently present,<br>
the count has not been completed, or the current event does not match).<br>
For example, if f1 is a standard, unqualified filter that applies to the current<br>
event, the expression "if (f1)", indicates that the current event must match that filter for<br>
the correlation to be performed. Then if there was a second standard filter, f2, both<br>
filters could be tested for with the expression "if (fl or f2)". In this expression, if the<br>
input event matched either fl or f2, the correlation would be performed. The<br>
correlation filter expression may also include nested conditions such as a logical<br>
"if/else if expression in a format similar to the following:<br>
An alarm rule of the present invention can be used with or without logic. In the<br>
absence of any controlling logic, an action statement in the rule will be executed<br>
whenever an event is received. An event will be received whenever there is an event<br>
that matches any of the declared filters. The rule may be segmented into various<br>
groups of actions based on testing whether one or more of the declared filters in the rule<br>
is true, for example, by forming a Boolean expression using the names of the filters and<br>
testing its truth at any given time. For example, if there were three filters named A, B,<br>
and C, a test could be performed for (A and (B or C)). This would mean that the<br>
expression is true if filter A is true and filter B or C is true. This rule, for example, may<br>
be expressed as follows.<br>
If (A and (B or Q)<br>
SendModifedAlarm(-l 10);<br>
else<br>
SendModifiedAlarm(-l 0);<br>
In this example, different alarm levels are being set based on testing which filters are<br>
true.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there are four action<br>
statements, SendEvent, SendModifiedInputEvent, SendModifiedAlarm, and<br>
SendModifiedCondition supported in the event correlation rule syntax which send<br>
events. The action statement SendEvent starts with a newly created event and must<br>
have each mandatory field for the event supplied as an argument, with the exception of<br>
fields that can be assigned default values like time, node and agent node. Any event<br>
type can be submitted with this action. The action statement SendModifiedlnputEvent<br>
uses the input event as a template for the output event, replacing only fields specified as<br>
arguments to SendModifiedlnputEvent. The event time is updated to the current time,<br>
and if this causes a problem for a condition or alarm (conditions and alarms required<br>
that the event time &gt; condition time), the time is set to, for example, the time of the<br>
input event (which already had to be greater than the condtion_time) plus one second.<br>
The action statement SendModifiedAlarm is built on top of SendModifiedlnputEvent.<br>
Its only difference is that it only sends an alarm, e.g., it forces a set of the event type to<br>
alarm_set. It also handles creating an alarm from a discrete event which does not have<br>
a condition time, setting the condition time to the current time. The action statement<br>
SendModifiedCondition is the same as SendModifiedAlarm except the type is forced to<br>
be condition_set.<br>
The qualifiers for a correlation filter may include, for example, ConditionExists,<br>
Count and CountDiscrete. The qualifier ConditionExists indicates that the filter should<br>
be applied to events already received by the time the current event was received. If a<br>
prior statefull event exists that matches the specified filter, the filter expression will be<br>
true. Otherwise it will be false. The qualifier Count is used to track the number of<br>
times a matching event happened within a specified time period. Its specification is<br>
count(number of times, time interval, filter). Upon firing the set is purged., so upon<br>
receipt of the next matching event the count will be zero. The time window may be<br>
scrolling in which the oldest matching events are dropped off the pending list as they<br>
differ from the most recently added event by the time interval specified. The qualifier<br>
CountDiscrete counts discrete events. It is the equivalent of Count with its filter<br>
modified to be, for example, filter_filter AND type=discrete.<br>
Events can be retrieved from any node to where the alarm rule is running. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the determination of where to run a<br>
rule may be dependent on the nature of the rule. If the rule specifies events only<br>
occurring on a local node, for example, then the rule needs to run on all nodes where<br>
such a correlation is desired. For example, if the rule was to perform some form of<br>
correlation for an event about the CPU usage of a machine and the filter did not specify<br>
a node, then the event correlator running the rule only receives events about CPU usage<br>
on the node where the subscription takes place. Accordingly, the filter and rule can be<br>
generic and applicable on each machine. Therefore the distribution list for the rule<br>
should include every node on which the respective correlation takes place.<br>
A generic rule also allows a single definition to be applicable to the same type<br>
of problem on every host in the enterprise, thereby reducing the number of rules to<br>
maintain and configure. A generic rule allows the analysis and correction of the<br>
problem to be localized to where it occurs, e.g., on each node.<br>
The alarm rule store 406 may include an alarm rule service processor that<br>
manages alarm rules and response policies stored in a central storage location such as<br>
the DEX 405. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the DEX 405 is a<br>
central storage location for reusable information, including data configuration, product<br>
information, event information, security information, and rules. The DEX 405 may be<br>
a distributed, multi-platform, multi-data format, shared data store including a plurality<br>
of data stores, relational data, data locations, and files.<br>
The response engine 414 executes a response policy. The response engine 414<br>
includes a plurality of processes. The response policy is, for example, a logical<br>
expression containing a list of actions connected by logic statements that is invoked by<br>
a triggering alarm generated by the event correlator 413. Multiple actions can be<br>
defined and be performed in the response policy. In an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the multiple actions may be in a listed sequence, or added with logic<br>
to make each action contingent upon the receipt of a return code of another action or a<br>
specified field sent in the alarm. The response policy may be created by defining a set<br>
of actions and composing an expression that references one or more of these actions in<br>
a logical sequence. The actions may be global and called by multiple response policies.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the response engine 414 also<br>
adds information about the success of each action to the triggering alarm at the<br>
completion of each step. This may be accomplished, for example, by sending an<br>
update alarm event that updates the event with the sequential number of the step just<br>
completed, the type of the step (e.g. email/page), and in the event archive the name of<br>
the action step. This information may be accessed through a director.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the response engine 414<br>
may include, for example, a first process, a second process, and a third process. The<br>
first process subscribes to events sent by an event correlator 413 running on the same<br>
node 410 as the response engine 414. Upon receipt of an alarm that has an associated<br>
response policy, the first process invokes the second process to perform the policy. The<br>
first process can invoke multiple instances of the second process depending upon the<br>
settings in configuration files associated with the respective processes. The second<br>
process performs an action requiring the sending of events and calls the third process to<br>
perform any other actions. The third process of the response engine 414 may also<br>
perform a response policy action requiring a call to the operating system, such as<br>
sending an email message, invoking a script, sending a page, writing a message to a<br>
file, or forwarding the event as a simple network management protocol (SNMP) trap.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the following tokens,<br>
production rules, and correlation language implemented using yacc may be used.<br>
The event management system of the present invention provides hierarchical<br>
consolidation on a subscription basis. For example, a director 403 has a consolidated<br>
view of events in the enterprise based on subscribing to the various nodes providing<br>
event information. The event information may be presented as a single, unified view,<br>
but can be based on multiple subscriptions to different event sources. The<br>
configuration of correlation rules allows a set of correlation rules to implement a<br>
hierarchy of correlation or consolidation by using the same subscription mechanism<br>
within the rules that the director 403 may use to consolidate events from multiple<br>
sources. For example, if an application running on node A relies on databases on node<br>
B and node C, a single rule monitoring this application can consolidate events about the<br>
application on node A, the ability to maintain connectivity to nodes B and C, and the<br>
status of the databases on nodes B and C. This may be accomplished by configuring<br>
the filters in the rule to specify these sources.<br>
Further, consolidating all of the errors from one node to another node can be<br>
similarly implemented with suitable configured correlation rules. For example,<br>
utilizing a rule, node A can consolidate problems from nodes B and C. The output of<br>
the event correlator with respect to locally generated events may be, for example, a<br>
consolidation of the events of the node into alarms. According to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the event correlator on node A can subscribe to the alarms that are<br>
generated on nodes B and C. This effectively brings all the declared problems to node<br>
A. The declared problems then may be re-declared as alarms on node A, based on the<br>
contents of the rule, or could be used in the rule to determine certain types of<br>
correlation across the problems reported on nodes B, C, and A. Re-declaring problems<br>
would allow a redundant local copy or a subscription that only specifies a respective<br>
node to allow one to view the problems spanning all three nodes.<br>
Accordingly, the hierarchical consolidation provided by the event management<br>
system of the present invention does not require any additional configuration outside of<br>
the rule itself. No need exists to maintain the relationships outside of the relationships<br>
between rules. The hierarchy can effectively vary on a rule basis. One node can be the<br>
consolidation point for certain problems while another node can be the consolidation<br>
node for a different set with both of these nodes contributing to each other"s<br>
consolidation.<br>
The event management system of the present invention can dynamically, e.g.,<br>
while the event correlator is running, determine whether a rule was changed, added or<br>
deleted. The user-defined alarm rules are maintained, for example, in an alarm rule<br>
store (ARS) 406 in a central store in the DEX 405. The editing or addition of rules may<br>
be performed via a director 403. FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary flowchart for<br>
dynamic execution of added or modified rules. As shown in FIG. 5, in step 510 the<br>
director 403 queries the ARS 406 for rules and writes any changes back to the ARS<br>
406. The ARS 406 publishes an event whenever it updates the rules in the ARS 406.<br>
The event correlator 413 on each of the nodes subscribes for this event. Upon receiving<br>
this event, each of the event correlators 413 knows to contact the ARS 406 to determine<br>
if the rules they run have been updated. For example, the event published by the ARS<br>
406 may indicate that the rule store has changed.<br>
In step 530, the respective event correlator 413 contacts the ARS 406,<br>
requesting its rule set. In step 540, the event correlator 413 then compares its current<br>
set of rules that it is running to the rules received form the ARS 406. In step 550, any<br>
rules that are unchanged need no action, any new rules need to be added to the rale set<br>
of the respective event correlator, and any rules that have been deleted from the ARS<br>
406 need to be removed from the rale set of the respective event correlator. In step<br>
560, any changed or added rales to the rale set of the respective event correlator will be<br>
executed. Further, the rale set may be distributed across multiple correlators.<br>
Accordingly, correlation done by any particular node can be rerouted to another node<br>
by changing the rales distribution list.<br>
A rale can be added to the event management system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention dynamically by adding a rale to a running event<br>
correlator since each rale maintains its own event stream. Adding or removing a<br>
subscription of a rale does not impact any other rale. A new rale may result in the<br>
event correlator receiving events it previously did not receive. These events will not<br>
change how any other rale is evaluated as those rales will not see the new events.<br>
Similarly, deleting a rale will result in the event correlator receiving fewer events than<br>
it did before. Not receiving these events, however, will not change the evaluation of<br>
any other rale being run by the event correlator. As each rale specifies an independent<br>
set of events to receive its own event stream, changes to a rale are isolated and will not<br>
impact any other rale.<br>
The rule would need to be parsed and the appropriate subscriptions formed so<br>
that the rule receives appropriate events. A rule also can be deleted from the event<br>
management system dynamically by canceling the outstanding subscriptions for the<br>
rule, removing the memory structures utilized in tracking the state of the rule and its<br>
evaluation tree, and removing alarms that the rule generated. A list of user-defined<br>
alarm rules is maintained by the event management system in an alarm rule store. A<br>
list of alarms by rule including the name of the event is maintained by the event<br>
management system, for example, in a blackboard.<br>
The event management system of the present invention allows the determination<br>
of an input event and alarm rule that resulted in the respective alarm. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the event management system keeps track of the<br>
respective alarms that are associated with the respective rules. The relationship of an<br>
alarm to what causes it can be determined from an analysis of the rule. For example, an<br>
n-to-1 mapping needs to be made between input events and the alarm, where n is the<br>
number of input events. In the simplest case, a single input event (n=l), maps to the<br>
creation of one alarm. Accordingly, the input event that caused the alarm is readily<br>
determined since only one input event is associated with the alarm.<br>
When condition filters or count filters are in use, however, the mapping<br>
becomes n-to-1. The mapping can be represented, for example, as a tuple of<br>
information relating a plurality of input event IDs to the output alarm ED. The<br>
determination of what events were considered may include, for example, the current<br>
input event at the time of generating the rule. The determination of what events were<br>
considered may also include events stored by any of the statefull events (e.g.,<br>
ConditionExists or Count based filters which may specify one or more events that have<br>
already occurred) that were also in the controlling "if" block that resulted in the rule<br>
action to generate an alarm. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, all<br>
of these events have a single unique ID except the generated alarm. The alarm,<br>
however, may not have a unique ID until the event has been processed by an event<br>
manager. Thus, in the absence of a unique identifier for the output alarm, a full multi-<br>
part key of the alarm may be used to allow the n-to-1 relationship record to be written<br>
out. Accordingly, the input event and alarm rule that resulted in the respective alarm<br>
may be determined.<br>
Alternatively, in the absence of a unique identifier for the output alarm,<br>
postponing the output of the n-to-1 relationship record until the alarm event is received<br>
back by the rule may allow its corresponding unique ID to be known. The n-to-1<br>
relationship record may then be written out as a result of being provided with the<br>
corresponding unique ID. Accordingly, the input event and alarm rule that resulted in<br>
the respective alarm may be determined.<br>
Alternatively, a unique submitter assigned ID may be used at the time of the<br>
creation of an event such as an alarm. The submitter assigned ID may be used instead<br>
of an event manager assigned unique ID, to allow the n-to-1 relationship record to be<br>
written out. Accordingly, the input event and alarm rule the resulted in the respective<br>
alarm may be determined.<br>
In any event, the output, e.g., n-to-1 relationship record, may be stored as a table<br>
and maintained as part of the event archive. Accordingly, the event archive service<br>
processor could be augmented to provide a query for related events that would use the<br>
event archive to obtain information provided by the n-to-1 relationship record.<br>
The embodiments described above are illustrative examples of the present<br>
invention and it should not be construed that the present invention is limited to these<br>
particular embodiments. Various changes and modifications may be effected by one<br>
