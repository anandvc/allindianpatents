1.	Field of the Invention<br>
   This invention relates to a complex working machine including such as a machining tool/ an assembling machine, a cleaning machine, a measuring machine or an stamping machine.<br>
2.	Description of,theBackground Art<br>
Generally/ a complex processing system sequentially<br>
    makes a plural kinds of processing for a workpiece using a plurality of machining tools arranged on a plurality of processing stations. Each machining tool is constructed of beds individually arranged/ an X-axis column which reciprocates in a horizontal axial direction for these b«ds, a Y-axis saddle<br>
    reciprocatably mounted on the X-axis column in a Y (vertical) direction, a Z-axis saddle mounted on the Y-axis saddle, which reciprocates in a horizontal Z-axis direction perpendicular to the X-axis direction and a spindle mounted on the Z-axis saddle (see Japanese Patent Onexamined Publication No.<br>
    JP-A-6-106445) .<br>
In the above complex processing machine, an area for maintenance must be provided in the X-axis direction between the individual machining tools so as to permit an operator to do maintenance. This presents a problem that the entire length<br>
    in the X-direction of the processing system is increased. In<br>
order to solve this problem, traditionally, a processing machine has also been proposed in which two processing machines are arranged with their back* facing each other, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Uncxamined Publication No. JP-A-2000-280129. Further, in order to solve the same problem, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. JP-A-2001-121386 proposes a production line in which two machining tools are combined with each other and an area for maintenance is provided between the machining tools.

As a result, the machining tools disclosed have a limitation in reducing an installation space. Further, where a plurality of machining tools each individually provided with a bed are arranged to constitute a production line, a greater<br>
installation space was required and a longer working time for installation was taken because of a large number of beds.<br>
Also in the complex working machine such as a such as<br>
the assembling machine, cleaning machine, measuring machine<br>
  or stamping machine other than the above machining tools, the<br>
area for maintenance must be provided between the machines and<br>
so the installation space cannot be reduced.<br>

given of an embodiment of a complex working machine according to this invention.<br>
As seen from Fig*. 3 and 4, on a bed 11, a pair of guide rails 12 are laid in parallel to each other so as to be oriented 5 in an x-axis direction. On the guide rails 12, as seen from Fig. 1, a first to fourth process ing machines 13 to 16 as working machines are arranged movably in the X-axis direction. Between both guide rails 12, a bait-like stator 21 is arranged. The stator 21 is composed of N-pole and S-pole permanent magnets<br>
 arranged alternately and in series constituting a linear motor, and has an installation length approximately equal to that of the guide rails 12. On the lower faces of X-axis columns 17 to 20 which are moving bodies of the first to fourth working machines 13 to 16, movable bodies constituting linear motors,<br>
    respectively are provided so as to correspond to the stator 21. The stator 21 and the respective movable bodies constitute first to fourth X-axis linear motors 22 to 25. These first to fourth X-axis linear motors 22 to 25 function as driving means to drive respective X-axis columns 17 to 20. And by<br>
   controlling the first to fourth X-axis linear motors 22 to 25, th« X-axis columns 17 to 20 individually reciprocate in the X-axis direction.<br>
The first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 have substantially the same structure. Therefore, an explanation<br>
?.s  will be mainly given of the first processing machine 13. On<br>
the vertical surface of an upright portion of the X-axis column 17 of the first processing machine 13, a pair of Y-axis guide rails 26 are laid in parallel in a Y-axis (vertical) direction. On the Y-axis guide rails 26, a Y-axis saddle 27 is mounted  reciprocatably in the Y-axis direction, respectively. The Y-axis saddle 27 is adapted to reciprocate in the Y-axis direction by a first Y-axis servo motor 28A attached to the upper end of the X-axis column 17 and a ball screw 29 which is rotated by the first Y-axis servo motor 28A, and a ball screw<br>
nut (not shown) attached to the rear face of the Y-axis saddle 27 and screwed with the ball screw 29. On the vertical surface of the Y-axis saddle 27, a pair of Z-axis guide rails 31 are laid apart from each other and in parallel in both Z-axis direction and Y-axis direction. A Z-axis saddle 32 is mounted<br>
on the Z-axis guide rails 31. The Z-axis saddle 32 is adapted to reciprocate in a Z-axis direction by a first 2-axis servo motor 33A and ball screw 34 attached to the lower portion of the Y-axis saddle 27 and a ball screw nut 35 attached to the Z-axis saddle 32 and screwed with the ball screw 34. A spindle<br>
stand 36 is attached to the side wall of the 2-axis saddle 32. A spindle device 37 is mounted on the spindle stand 36. A spindle 38 is mounted in the spindle device 37. A first spindle motor 39A for rotating the spindle 38 is mounted on the rear end of the spindle stand 36.<br>
     As seen from Figs. 3 and 4, in the second to fourth<br>
processing machines 14 to 16, second to fourth Y-axis servo motors 28B to 28D, second to fourth Z-axis servo motors 33B to 33D and second to fourth spindle mo tors 39B to 39D correspond to the first Y-axis servo motor 28A, first Z-axi$ servo motor 5 33A and first spindle motor 39A in the first processing machine 13, respectively.<br>
As seen from Fig. 7, the above first X-axis linear motor 22, first Y-axis servo motor 28A, first Z-axis servo motor 33A and first spindle motor 39A are connected to a single control<br>
device 41 through a first driving circuit 42. Likewise, th* second X-axis linoar motor 23, second Y-axis servo motor 28B, second Z-axis servo motor 33B and second spindle motor 39B are connected to the single control device 41 through a second driving circuit 43. Further, the third X-axis linear motor<br>
24, third Y-axis servo motor 28C, third Z-axis servo motor 33C and third spindle motor 39C are connected to the single control device 41 through a third driving circuit 44. Further, the fourth X-axis linear motor 25, fourth Y-axis servo motor 28D, fourth Z-axis servo motor 33D and fourth spindle motor 39V are<br>
connected to the single control device 41 through a fourth driving circuit 45. And the various motors are rotation-controlled by control signals supplied from the control device 41 so that a workpiece W supported by a worktable 52 as a working table described later is machined by the tool<br>
attached to the spindle 38.<br>

As se«n from Figs. 3 and 4, on the front side of the bed 11, worktables 52 for supporting a workpiece W are mounted so as to correspond to the respective spindle 38 of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 through a plurality of 5 brackets 51. In front of the worktables 52, a workpiece carrying in/out mechanism 53 is mounted which carries in the workpiece to each worktable 52 and carries out th« workpi«ce machined. The workpiece carrying in/out mechanism 53 is constructed of a supporting stand 54, guide rollers 55 supported at a large<br>
number of positions on the upper surface of the supporting stand 54 and a plurality of pallets 56 supported on the upper surface of each guide roller 55. Beneath the above brackets 51 and worktables 52, a chipping conveyer 57 is provided commonly to the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16. The chip<br>
conveyer 57 serves to collect/remove chippings exhausted from the machined workpiece.<br>
Mainly referring to Figs, 4 to 6, an explanation will be given of a cover device 61. The cover device 61 is attached to an upper face of the front end of the bed 11, that is, the<br>
cover device 61 is attached at an upper surface of a position between the bed 11 and the worktable 52 so as to shield a space defined between an area on which the plurality of worktable 52 are provided and an area in which the X-axis columns 17 to 20 move. The cover device 61 serves to prevent coolant and<br>
  chippings from flying during machining of the workpiece W<br>
, UJ 030 I J3 33	» I O/ 0 I<br>
toward the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16.<br>
As seen from Figs. 4 and 6, a horizontally-lengthy square frame 62 is attached to the upper face at the front end of the bed 11. lnsid« the frame 62, movable frameworks 63 5 corresponding to the respective spindle devices 37 of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 are mounted reciprocatably in the X-axis direction by channel-like guide gutters 64 attached to the upper and lower segments of the frame 62. Within the movable framework 63, as seen from Fig. 5, a<br>
slide cover 65 is mounted for shielding the outer periphery of the spindle device 37 and inner periphery of the movable framework 63 from each other. The slide cover 65, as seen from Fig. 6, is constructed of a plate 66 to the outer periphery of the spindle device 37 and A plurality of cover pieces 67<br>
coupled with both upper and lower distal edges of the plate 66.<br>
Between the respective frames 62A, 62B and the respective movable frameworks 63 corresponding the frames 62A, 628, take-up covers 71 are mounted, respectively. Further, the<br>
take-up covers 71 are mounted between each of the movable frameworks 63. The cover 71, as seen from Fig. 5, is constructed of a case 72 attached to a vertical framework 62A, 63B and a shielding cloth 73 which is accommodated in a roll-shape within the case 72 and has a tip coupled with another<br>
  vertical framework 63A, 62B.<br>
, V J 'J JV I JJ J'J	#  I'/<br>
Therefore, in Fig. 5, when the spindle device 37 is<br>
reciprocated in the X-direction, the shielding cloth 73 of the<br>
cover 71 is wound back or up from inside the case 72 so that<br>
the spaces, which is defined between the frame 62 and the<br>
movable framework 63, and between each movable frameworks<br>
63,are shielded by the shielding cloth 73. Further, in Fig.<br>
6, when the spindle device 37 reciprocates in the Y direction,<br>
the cover pieces 67 of the slide cover 65 expand or contract<br>
(telescopicly) so that the space between the spindle device<br>
  37 and movable framework 63 is always shielded.<br>
On the upper face of an upper horizontal framework 62C of the frame 62 constituting the above cover device 61, a tool magazine 75 is mounted. The tool magazine 75 is constructed of a holder 76 which is laid on the upper face of the upper<br>
horizontal framework 62C of the frame 62 and oriented in the X-axis direction and graspers 77 which are downward attached to the front end of the holder 76 so as to grasp the tools, respectively, the graspers 77 are provided at a large number of positions at equal pitches in the X-axis direction.<br>
Next, an explanation will given of the operation of the complex working machine constructed as described above.<br>
it is assumed that a workpiece W is subjected to several kinds of processing by the complex working machine. First, the workpiec* W supported on the pallet 56 of the workpiece carrying<br>
in/out mechanism 53 shown in Fig. 4 is carried in the worktable<br>
52 corresponding to the first processing machine 13. The workplace W, being clamped at a predetermined position by a clamping mechanism (not shown), is processed by the tool mounted in the spindle 38 in such a manner that the control 5 device 41 shown in tig. 1 supplies a control signal to the first driving circuit 42 to rotation-control the first X-axis linear motor 22, first Y-axis servo motor 28A, first Z-axis servo motor 33A and first spindle motor 39A .<br>
Upon completion of the processing of the workplace W by<br>
the first processing machine 13, the workpiece W is shifted to the worktable 52 corresponding to the second processing machine 14, and is processed again by the tool mounted in the spindle 38. Likewise, the workpiece W is sequentially processed by the tools mounted in the spindle 38 of the third processing<br>
machine 15 and fourth processing machine 16. The workpiece W for which the processing has been completed is shifted to the pallet 56 of the workpiece carrying in/out mechanism 53 and carried out by the guid« rollers 55 for carry-out.<br>
Where maintenance is done for each of the processing<br>
machines 13 to 16, they are moved in a direction leaving each other in the X-axis direction to assure an area for maintenance. For example, in order to assure the area for maintenance between the first processing machine 13 and the second processing machine 14, referring to Fig. 1, the first processing machine<br>
  13 is moved rightward in the X-axis direction and all the second<br>
to fourth processing machines 14 to 16 are moved leftward in the X-axis direction, thereby assuring a larger area for maintenance.<br>
The complex working machine according to the above   embodiment gives the following effects.<br>
(1) In this embodiment, the guide rails 12 common to the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 were laid in the X-axis direction on the upper face of th* single bed 11 and the X-axis columns 17 to 20 of the first to fourth processing machines<br>
13 to 16 were reciprocatably mounted on the guide rails 12. For this reason, in doing maintenance, the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 can be moved to leave each other in the X-axis direction to assure the .area for maintenance. Thus, it is not necessary to provide the special area for<br>
maintenance previously fixedly in addition to the reciprocating stroke in the X-axis direction required for processing of the processing machines 13 to 16. This reduces the installation space in the X-axis direction of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16. Further, since the<br>
single bed is employed, the time for its installing can be shortened.<br>
(2) In the embodiment described above, any two processing machines of the first to fourth machines 13 to 16 on the four processing stations corresponding to the four worktables 52<br>
to 52 can be moved for processing the workpiece on the single<br>
processing station. This can realize a variety of processing operations.<br>
(3)	In the embodiment described above, the stator 21 was laid<br>
on the upper face of the bed 11 and the movable bodies<br>
corresponding to the stator 21 were mounted in the X-axis columns 17 to 20 of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16, thereby constituting the first to fourth X-axis linear motors 22 to 25. For this reason, the respective lengths in the X-axis direction of the first to fourth processing machines 10 13 to 16 can be shortened. This also permits the complex working machine to be miniaturized.<br>
(4)	In the embodiment described above, the cover device 61<br>
was mounted on the upper face of the bed 11 in order to shield<br>
the space between the frame 62 constituting the cover device<br>
61 and the outer periphery of the spindle devices 37. This prevent the coolant or chippings from being scattered during processing of the workpiece toward the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16. In addition, the frame 62 of the cover device 61 serves as the component common to the first<br>
to fourth processing machines 13 to 16. This reduces the number of components and facilitates the manufacturing and assembling operation, thereby reducing the production cost.<br>
(5)	In the embodiment described above, on the upper end face<br>
of the frame 62 of the cover device 61, the tool magazine 75<br>
  was mounted. This holder 76 incorporates a large number of<br>
graspers 77 arranged at predetermined pitches in the X-axis direction. For this reason, the tool used can be easily replaced by a new tool. Particularly, since the spindle devices 37 of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 5 16 caused to reciprocate in the X-axis direction along the guide rails 12, by moving each of the spindle devices 37 in the X-axis direction to the extreme, the tool replacing area for each spindle devices can be extended, the movable range of the respective spindle devices 37 overlaps each other. Thus, the 10 tool replacing area can be shared with spindle devices 37. Accordingly; the kind of the tools to be incorporated in the tool magazine 75 can be reduced.<br>
(6)	In the embodiment described above, the chipping conveyer<br>
57 was provided commonly to the first to fourth processing<br>
machines 13 to 16 beneath the plurality of worktables 52 corresponding to the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16. For this reason, the chipping conveyer 57 can be simplified to reduce the number of components and facilitate the manufacturing and assembling operation, thereby reducing<br>
  the production cost.<br>
(7)	in the embodiment described above, as seen from Fig. 3,<br>
inside the two guide rails 12, the stator 21 and X-axis linear<br>
motors 22 to 25 which serve as the driving unit were provided.<br>
For this reason, the installation space for the driving unit<br>
can be easily assured.<br>
Incidentally, the embodiment described above may be modified as follows.<br>
As seen from Fig. 8, a ball screw 95 common to the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 may be non-rotatably 5 supported by bearings 96 at a predetermined position above the upper face of the bed 11. Ball screw nuts 97 screwed with the ball screw 95 may be rotatably supported below the X-axis columns 17 to 20 of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16. Toothed wheels 98 may be provided on the ball screw<br>
nuts 97 so that they can be rotated reciprocatively by X-axis servo motors 99A to 99D and driving wheels (not shown) mounted in the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16, respectively.<br>
As seen from Fig. 9, a rack 100 common to the first to<br>
fourth processing machines 13 to 16 may be laid in the X direction on the upper face of the bed 11, and pinions 101 to mesh with the rack 100 may be provided in the X-axis columns 17 to 20 of the first to fourth processing machines 13 to 16 so that they can be rotated reciprocatively by the X-axis servo<br>
motors 99A to 99D.<br>
As seen from Fig. 10, four ball screws 95 may be rotatably provided on at predetermined positions above the upper face of the bed 11 by the bearings 96, and the ball screw nuts 97 attached to the X-axis columns 17 to 20 of the first to fourth<br>
  processing machines 13 to 16 may be screwed with the ball screws<br>
ff  t t /<br>
Vf<br>
95, And the ball screws 95 may be designed so that they can<br>
be rotated reciprocatively by X-axis servo motors 99A to 99D.<br>
As seen from Fig. 11, the one guide rail 12 may be mounted<br>
on the frame 62 of the cover device 61 upright provided on the<br>
  upper surface of the bed 11. And the X-axis columns 17 to 20<br>
may be reciprocatably mounted on this one guide rail 12 and<br>
the other guide rail 12 on the upper surface of the bed 11.<br>
In the embodiment described above/ the mechanism for<br>
carrying in/out the worfcpiece to/from the worktables 52 was<br>
apallet system. However, this mechanism may be a robot system/<br>
gantry system or a transfer system.<br>
The first to fourth Y-axis servo motors 28A to 28D in the embodiment described above may be omitted. In this case, the movable frameworks 63 and cover pieces 67 can be done  without. Further, in a case where the rotational tools are not necessary, the first to fourth spindle motors 39A to 39D may be omitted.<br>
The graspers 77 of the tool magazine 75 may be caused to circle by e.g. a chain conveyer hung on both ends of the   holder 76.<br>
Outside the above two guide rails 12, 12, as the driving<br>
unit, the stator 21 and first to fourth X-axis linear motors<br>
22 to 25 may be provided. In this case, on the right side of<br>
the guide rail 12 on the upper face of the bed 11 shown in Fig.<br>
  11, the driving unit for the X-axis columns 17 to 20 can be<br>
y<br>
arranged.<br>
