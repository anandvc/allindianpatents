				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> The present invention relates to a modified yeast strain.<br>
The formation of 3-oxo-delta4-steroids from 3ß-hydroxy-delta5 precursors in the biosynthesis of all classes of steroid hormones in mammals is catalysed by the enzyme system 3ß-hydroxy-deltas-steroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.145} and delta5-delta4-steroid isomerase (EC 5.3.3.1), designated 3ß-HSD.  For example/ 30-HSD catalyses the transformation of pregnenolone to progesterone, of l7α-hydroxypregnenolone to 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, of dehydroepiandrosterone to delta4-androstenedione or of 5-androstene-3ß-17ß-diol to testosterone (Slmard et al., 1996).<br>
Thus, 3ß-HSD is one of the key enzymes in the route for biosynthesis of hydrocortisone starting from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex of mammals (Figure 1).<br>
The use of recombinant microorganisms, especially modified yeasts, permitting heterologous expression of one or more of the mammalian enzymes of this biosynthetic route for producing hydrocortisone or intermediates of this biosynthesis was described for example in European patent application EP 340878, US Patent 5,137,822, Dumas et al., 1994 and Cauet et al., 1994.<br>
When functional 3ß-HSD is expressed in yeast, the transformed yeast cells do not completely convert 3ß-hydroxysteroids to the corresponding 3-oxosteroids, for example pregnenolone to progesterone, but accumulate a compound which is also observed in the case of cells of untransformed yeast. Identification of the compound accumulated as the 30-acetate ester of the starting steroid and characterization of the enzyme possessing acyltransferase activity which is responsible for this esterification {designated hereinafter as APAT for "acetyl-coenzyme A pregnenolone acetyltransferase") are described in the present application.  Furthermore, accumulation of pregnenolone acetate by a pregnenolone-producing transformed yeast strain was described in European patent application EP 727489.  It can be considered on the basis of these observations that esterification of the 30-hydroxysteroids produced by the yeast is undesirable as it is responsible for secondary reactions and by-products leading to<br><br>
a decrease in the yield of accumulated 3p-hydroxysteroids, for example pregnenolone, or to a decrease in the yield of bioconversion of 3p-hydroxy-delta5-steroids to 3 -oxo-delta4-steroids, particularly in the production of progesterone or of 17a-hydroxy-progesterone leading to a decrease in subsequent production of hydrocortisone by the biosynthetic route already mentioned.<br>
On the basis of the results obtained, mentioned above, the present invention describes the construction of yeast strains that have lost the undesirable APAT activity, by alteration of the gene coding for this activity, resulting in stabilization of the 3p-hydroxysteroids in the presence of the latter.  These strains can therefore be used as starting strains for constructing recombinant strains that are capable of converting 3p-hydroxysteroids to further products with improved yields.<br>
The invention also describes the construction of yeast strains that have lost APAT activity by alteration of the gene coding for this activity and either expressing 3p-HSD or the cytochrome P4S017<x or co-expressing and the cytochrome p45017a of route biosynthesis hydrocortisone from cholesterol. strains expressing for example make it possible to improve yields in bioconversion can therefore be used processes improved production its intermediates yeast.></x>
A subject of the present invention is therefore a modified yeast strain in which the acetyl-CoA pregnenolone acetyltransferase (APAT) activity is eliminated by altering the gene coding for this activity, resulting in stabilization of the 3p-hydroxysteroids.<br>
Alteration of the gene coding for APAT activity can be effected for example by insertion, deletion or substitution of a DNA sequence in the functional elements of the gene, for example the promoter or the sequence coding for the protein possessing APAT activity.  Integration of the DNA sequence altered in this way in a host strain of yeast can then be effected for example by the technique of homologous recombination and leads to the generation of chromosomal<br><br>
mutants of yeast corresponding to the modified strains of the invention in which the disappearance of APAT activity and the stabilization of 30-hydroxysteroids are demonstrated, for example by cell culture in the presence of pregnenolone and by measuring the pregnenolone content as a function of time, following the operating conditions described later in the experimental section.<br>
The following may be mentioned in particular as host yeast strains used for the invention:  strains of Saccharomyces such as S. cerevisiae, strains of Candida such as C. maltosa, strains of Kluyveromyces such as K. lactis or strains of Pichia such as P. pastoris.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is a yeast strain modified as above in which the gene altered is the ATF2 gene of S. cerevisiae or a homologue of the latter.<br>
By gene ATF2 we mean the gene of S. cerevisiae identified in the yeast genome at locus ATF2 or YGR177c, of "Saccharomyces Genome Database" (SGD); (Cherry et al. http://genome-www.stanford.edu /Saccharomyces/) of which the open reading frame (ORF) designated YGR177c is translated into an amino acid sequence in the Mips database, accessible under accession number S64491 (Hebling U., Hofmann B. and Delius H. (May 1996)) and whose sequence is shown in Figure 4.  This gene codes for a protein possessing APAT activity, as is shown later in the experimental section.<br>
By gene that is a homologue of the ATF2 gene, we mean a gene that codes for a protein possessing APAT activity and possessing sequence identity of about 60% or more with the sequence of protein YGR177C.<br>
A more particular subject of the invention is a modified yeast strain as above in which the altered gene is the ATF2 gene of S. cerevisiae, designated hereinafter as atf2 mutant strain.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is a modified yeast strain as above, in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of a DNA sequence that has at least one nucleotide.<br>
The DNA sequence that is inserted in the ATF2 gene so as to lose all APAT activity can be, for example, an auxotrophic<br><br>
selection gene supplying a nutritional requirement of the host strain such as the gene URA3, the gene LEU2, the gene TRP1, the gene HIS3 or the gene ADE2, for example a dominant selection gene such as a gene for resistance to an antibiotic such as G418, phleomycin or hygromycin B or for example a reporter gene such as the PGAL gene.<br>
The DNA sequence that is inserted in the ATF2 gene can also be a yeast expression block made up of a promoter and a transcription terminator, for example a yeast promoter such as PGK, TDH3, CYC1 or TEF1, for example a yeast terminator such as CYC1, TDH3, TEF1 or PGK.  The expression block can be a combination of the elements mentioned above, for example the block TEFlprom/PGKterm.<br>
A more quite particular subject of the invention is a modified yeast strain as above, in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of the URA3 selection gene or of the expression block TEFlproa/PGKterm.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is a modified yeast strain as above, in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of the URA3 selection gene.<br>
The atf2 mutant strains of the invention, devoid of APAT activity and in which the URA3 gene has been inserted, designated hereinafter as atf2-A::URA3, could thus be selected by prototrophy with uracil.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is modified strains of S. cerevisiae designated as TGY156 and TGY158, the detailed constructions of which are given later in the experimental section.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is also a modified yeast strain as above, in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of the expression block TEFlprom/PGKterm.  The atf2 mutant strains of the invention, devoid of APAT activity and in which the expression block TEFlprom/PGKCerm has been inserted, designated hereinafter as atf2-A: :TEFlprom/PGKterml could be selected for absence of a functional URA3 gene, replaced by an expression block, by their resistance to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FO).<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is the<br>
modified strain of S. cerevisiae designated as TGY186, the detailed construction of which is given later in the experimental section.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a transformed yeast strain in which the acetyl-CoA pregnenolone acetyltransferase (APAT) activity is eliminated by altering the gene coding for this activity and expressing at least one of the mammalian enzymes of the route of biosynthesis of hydrocortisone starting from cholesterol, chosen from:<br>
-	the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (P450SCC) ,<br>
-	3p-hydroxy-delta5-steroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4-steroid<br>
isomerase OP-HSD) and<br>
-	17cc-steroid hydroxylase (P45017a) .<br>
The transformed yeast strains of the invention can be obtained for example by transformation of atf2 mutant strains of the invention by known methods, for example by transformation by an expression vector of P4SOSCC as well as of ADX and ADR, by an expression vector of 3P-HSD or by an expression vector of P45017a.  The atf2 mutant strains can also be co-transformed if necessary, for example by an expression vector of 3P-HSD and by an expression vector of P45017a or be transformed by a co-expression vector of 3P-HSD and P45017cc and be used for example in a process of bioconversion of pregnenolone to 17a-hydroxyprogesterone.<br>
Vectors constructed for the expression of P450SCC as well as of ADX and ADR, of 3P-HSD or of P4S017a of bovine or human origin in yeast strains were described for example by Dumas et al., 1994, in European patent application EP 340878 or in US Patent 5,137,822.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is a transformed yeast strain as above, in which the altered gene is the ATF2 gene of S. cerevisiae or a homologue of the latter.  A more particular subject of the invention is a transformed yeast strain as above, in which the altered gene is the ATF2 gene of S. cerevisiae and corresponds to a transformed atf2 strain.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is a transformed yeast strain as above, in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of a DNA sequence possessing at least one<br>
nucleotide and especially a transformed yeast strain in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of the URA3 selection gene and corresponds to a modified atf2-A::URA3 strain.<br>
Alteration of the gene so as to lose all APAT activity, the ATF2 gene or a homologue of the latter as well as the host strains have the meanings indicated previously.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is a transformed yeast strain atf2-A::URA3 as above expressing 3(3-HSD and in particular the transformed strain of 5. cerevisiae designated TGY158/pTG10862 of which a detailed construction is described later in the experimental section.<br>
A quite particular subject of the is also a transformed yeast strain as above, in which the ATF2 gene is altered by insertion of the expression block TEFlprom/PGKterm and corresponding to a transformed strain atf2-A:: TEFlprom/PGKterm.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is also a transformed strain atf2-A::TEFlprom/PGKterm as above expressing P4S017a and in particular the transformed strain of S. cerevisiae designated TGY186/pTG10435.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is a modified yeast strain a tf 2-A: : TEFlprom/PGKterm as above co-expressing 3(3-HSD and P45017a and quite particularly the transformed strain of S. cerevisiae designated as TGY186/pTG10417.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a process of oxidation in vivo of a substrate chosen among an endogenous sterol, an exogenous sterol or an exogenous steroid in which transformed yeast strain as above is used, which is either cultivated alone when the strain produces the endogenous sterol, or is incubated with the sterol or the exogenous steroid and the oxidized compound obtained is isolated if required.<br>
By endogenous sterol we mean a sterol that is accumulated in a yeast strain and which is a substrate of the side chain cleavage enzyme (P450SCC) when the yeast, after transformation for example by an expression vector of P450SCC, of ADX and of ADR, is cultivated in the absence of exogenous sterol.  The endogenous sterols used for applying the process of the invention can be for example ergosta-5-en-3-ol, ergosta-5,24(28)-dien-3-ol or ergosta-5,22-dien-3-ol.  European patent<br>
application EP 727489 describes the accumulation of these sterols in a yeast strain and the cleavage of their side chain in a culture of the strain after transformation by an expression vector of P450SCC, of ADX and of ADR.  Such a yeast strain, in which APAT activity is also present, can be modified beforehand to obtain an atf2 mutant strain according to the invention, then be transformed by an expression vector of P450SCC, of ADX and of ADR to obtain an atf2 mutant strain transformed according to the invention.<br>
By exogenous sterol we mean a sterol which is a substrate of the P450SCC cleavage enzyme by incubation with a yeast strain transformed by an expression vector of P450SCC, of ADX and of ADR, for example cholesterol or sitosterol.  Such a strain can be, for example, an atf2 mutant strain transformed by an expression vector of P450SCC, of ADX and of ADR.<br>
The 3|3-hydroxysteroid obtained by cleavage of the side chain of the endogenous or exogenous sterol used as substrate is completely in the free form, i.e. is not accompanied by the corresponding 3p~acetate ester, in cultures of transformed atf2 strains expressing P4SOSCC, ADX and ADR.<br>
By steroid we mean a steroid which is a substrate of the 3P-HSD enzyme by incubation with a yeast strain transformed for example by an expression vector of 3P-HSD, such as pregnenolone, 17<x-hydroxypregnenolone or></x-hydroxypregnenolone>
dehydroepiandrosterone or a steroid which is a substrate of the P45017a enzyme by incubation with a yeast strain transformed for example by an expression vector of P45017a, such as progesterone or pregnenolone.  Such a strain can, for example, be an atf2 mutant strain transformed by an expression vector of 3P-HSD or by an expression vector of P45017a according to the invention.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is the in-vivo oxidation process as above, in which the substrate is a 3P~ hydroxysteroid and in which a transformed yeast strain atf2-A::URA3 is used, expressing 3P-HSD, and the 3-oxo-delta4-steroid obtained is isolated if necessary, and especially a process in which the 3p-hydroxysteroid is chosen from pregnenolone or 17oc-hydroxypregnenolone.<br>
The 3p-hydroxysteroid used as substrate is stable when it<br>
is incubated with an atf2-A::URA3 strain of the invention, transformed by an expression vector of 3(3-HSD.  The invention thus provides an improved process for production of 3-oxo-delta4-steroid in a yeast since all of the 3p-hydroxy substrate can be oxidized to 3-oxo-delta4-steroid, as is shown later in the experimental section.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is also the in-vivo oxidation process as above, in which the substrate is a steroid and in which a transformed yeast strain atf2-A: :TEFlprom/PGKtenn expressing P45017a is used, and the 17a-hydroxyl steroid obtained is isolated if necessary, and especially a process in which the steroid substrate is pregnenolone or progesterone.<br>
The pregnenolone used as substrate is stable when it is incubated with a strain atf2-A: :TEFlprom/PGKCerm transformed by an expression vector of P45017oc.  The invention thus also provides an improved method of production of 17a-hydroxysteroids starting from 3|3-hydroxysteroids since all of the 3|3-hydroxy substrate can be 17oc-hydroxylated.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is also the above in-vivo oxidation process, in which the substrate is a 30-hydroxysteroid and in which a transformed yeast strain atf2-A: : TEFlprom/PGKterm co-expressing 3|3-HSD and P450-17a is used, and the 17cc-hydroxyl 3-oxo-delta4-steroid obtained is isolated if necessary'.  A quite particular subject of the invention is the above process in which the steroid substrate is pregnenolone.<br>
The transformed atf2 mutant yeast strains and the process of the invention suggest their advantageous use in improved production of hydrocortisone or of its intermediates in yeast.<br>
Examples of construction of the strains of the invention and of application of the process of the invention are described later in the experimental section. General materials and methods 1. Strains and media<br>
The strains of S. cerevisiae used for carrying out the invention are the strain TGY73.4 (MATa, URA3-A5, pral-1, prbl-1, prcl-1, cpsl-3, his) isogenic derivative Leu+ of cl3ABYS86 described by Achstetter et al., 1992 and the strain Fyl679 (MATa, URA3-52, trpl-A63, Ieu2-Al, his3-A200, fenl, GAL)<br>
described by Thierry et al., 1990.  The strains are grown on YPD complete medium (Difco Laboratories) containing 2% of glucose at 28°C according to the conditions described by F. Sherman, 1991.<br>
For the transformation of S. cerevisiae, the cells are made competent by the lithium acetate method (Ito et al., 1983).  The yeasts are cultivated routinely on a synthetic minimum medium SD containing 2% of glucose (F. Sherman, 1991) with addition of the required nutrients at a concentration of 100 /ig/ml.<br>
The E. coli strain BJ5183 (D. Hanahan, 1983) was used for in-vivo recombination and the E. coli strain C600, hsdR (Hubacek et al., 1970) was used as the receiving strain for the classical reactions of ligation.<br>
2.	Man i piil at-inn nf t.hp DNA and rgrnmh-j nat-.j on In VIVQ In E. coli<br>
The general methods of molecular biology used are described by Sambrook et al., 1989.  The method for recombination in vivo was described by E. Degryse, 1995 and E. Degryse, 1996.<br>
3.	Teat of APAT enzyme activity<br>
The APAT acetyltransferase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]acetate in the pregnenolone from [3H]acetyl-CoA (New England Nuclear).  The reaction medium (500 /xl) contains [3H] acetyl-CoA (20 yM, 25 Ci/mol) and pregnenolone (Sigma) (30 \M) .  The pregnenolone is added in solution in 2 p.1 of tyloxapol (Sigma)/ethanol mixture (1:1) in a potassium phosphate buffer (20mM) at pH 7.0.  After incubation for 15 minutes at 30°C, the reaction is stopped by adding 2 ml of dichloromethane.<br>
The steroids are extracted with dichloromethane, then separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hereinafter: RP-HPLC) in isocratic elution conditions with acetonitrile in an Ultrasphere ODS column (Beckman) at 45°C on an HP 1090 chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard) connected to a FLO-One 500 radiodetector (Packard) which permits measurement of the amount of pregnenolone [3H]acetate formed.<br>
One APAT unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme that<br>
produces 1 nmol of pregnenolone acetate per minute at 30°C, in the conditions described above.<br>
4. of the concentration of protein<br>
The protein concentration was measured using the "protein assay kit" (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention relates to a modified yeast strain in which the acetyl-CoA pregnenolone acetyltransferase (APAT) activity is eliminated by altering the ATF2 gene of S. cerevisiae or a homologue of the latter coding for this activity, resulting in stabilization of 3ß-hydroxysteroids.<br>
EXAMPLE 1;  Identification of the APAT activity of the yeast. A - In-vivo acetylation of pregnenolone by yeast.<br>
The TGY73.4 strain was cultivated at 28°C in 10 ml of YPD medium (Difco) inoculated at A600=0.1 from a 24 h preculture to which was added 100 µl  of a solution of pregnenolone at 10<br><br>
mg/ml in a tergitol (Sigma)/ethanol mixture (1:1).  The steroids formed were identified on 250 /zl aliquots of broth taken at intervals of time for 10 h.  After extraction with 2 ml of dichloromethane, the organic phases were evaporated under nitrogen, then the residues obtained were redissolved in acetonitrile.  The steroids were analysed by RP-HPLC on an Ultrasphere ODS column (Beckman) with the following successively as eluent:  acetonitrile at 60% in water for 10 min, then acetonitrile varying from 60 to 80% in water for 5 min, then acetonitrile at 80% for 5 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, at 45°C and with detection at 205 nm.<br>
The chromatograms obtained (Figure 2B) show that pregnenolone is metabolized to a more apolar product that possesses a TR identical to that of the pregnenolone acetate standard.  Figure 2A shows that the pregnenolone is rapidly converted by the yeast to its metabolite.<br>
After alkaline treatment (KOH at 6% in methanol), the metabolite observed releases a product that has a TR identical to that of pregnenolone.  Identification of the metabolite as pregnenolone acetate was then confirmed by mass spectrometry. B - Purification of the enzyme possessing APAT activity.<br>
The TGY73.4 strain was cultivated in a 10-litre fermenter in Kappeli medium (Fiechter et al., 1981) enriched with glucose at 160 g/1 at 30°C up to A600=30.  The cells were separated by centrifugation, washed with water then resuspended in 4 litres of Tris-HCl buffer 20 mM, pH 8.0 at 4°C (buffer A) containing 1 mM of PMSF.  The cells were disrupted in a Manton Gaulin homogenizer at a pressure of 1000 psi.  The cell lysate obtained was centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 15 min at 40°C, then zinc chloride was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 40 mM.  The pH was adjusted to 5.5 with IN HC1 and precipitation was effected for 30 min at 4°C.  After centrifugation at 10,000 xg for 10 min at 4°C, the precipitate was isolated and resuspended in 3 litres of buffer A containing 100 mM EDTA and 1 mM PSFM.  After removing the EDTA by diafiltration on a Y10S10 cartridge (Amicon) against 30 litres of buffer A, the retentate was charged at a rate of 35 ml/min and at 4°C in a column of 1.5 litres of DEAE-Sephacel<br>
 (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer A.  After washing the column with buffer A, then with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl, the APAT activity was eluted with buffer A containing 0.4 M NaCl.  The fractions of DEAE-Sephacel containing the APAT activity, measured as indicated above in "General Materials and Methods", were combined, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 2M, then they were charged at a rate of 15 ml/min and at 4°C in a column of 500 ml of Phenyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated in buffer A containing 2M NaCl.  After washing the column with buffer A containing 0.5M NaCl, the APAT activity is eluted with 1.5 litres of a linear gradient of sodium cholate varying from 0 to 1% in buffer A.  The fractions containing the APAT activity were combined, then concentrated by ultrafiltration on a YM10 membrane (Amicon), then stored at -80°C until use.<br>
The whole process was repeated once so as to prepare the material in sufficient quantity to continue purification.<br>
The material purified from the two aforementioned preparations was thawed, then charged at a rate of 4 ml/min and at 4°C in a column of 100 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated in buffer A.  After washing the column with the same buffer, the APAT activity was eluted with 500 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl varying from 0 to 1M in the same buffer.  The fractions of Q-Sepharose containing the APAT activity were combined and then charged directly at a rate of 2.5 ml/min and at 4°C in a column of 7 ml of sodium cholate immobilized on Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5M NaCl.  After washing the column with the same buffer, the APAT activity was eluted with 100 ml of a linear gradient of sodium cholate varying from 0 to 1% in the same buffer.  The fractions containing the APAT activity were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration on a YM10 membrane (Amicon) to a protein concentration of 1.8 mg/ml, then stored at -80°C.<br>
The APAT activity was thus purified about 500 times on the basis of the specific activity and with a yield of about 16% as shown in Table 1 below:<br>
Half of the semi-purified material obtained above (about 6 mg of protein) was then thawed and PEG 4000 (Prolabo) was added to a final concentration of 20% (w/v) to eliminate the cholate and the NaCl.  After stirring for 30 min at 4°C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 xg for 30 min at 4°C, then redissolved in 4 ml of buffer A.  The solution thus obtained was then charged at a rate of 1 ml/min in a column of Mono? HR5/20 (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer bis-Tris 25 mM pH 6.3.  The APAT activity was eluted with buffer Polybuffer 74 pH 4.0 (Pharmacia).  1 ml fractions were collected, each in the presence of 50 fj.1 of buffer Tris-HC1 2M, pH 8.0 so as to limit the inactivation of the enzyme at acid pH.  Fractions 14, 15 and 16 (Figure 3(A)) containing the highest APAT activity, measured as indicated above, were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration on YM10 membrane, then stored at -80°C before use.  The active fraction thus obtained was submitted to SDS-PAGE on gel with 10% polyacrylamide.  Several bands were revealed by staining with Coomassie blue with a majority band with an apparent MW of 62 kDa (Figure 3(B)), identical to the MW determined by filtration on gel of Superose 6 (Pharmacia) and corresponding to the APAT activity.<br>
C - Properties of APAT.<br>
a) Substrate specificity<br>
According to the method stated above for acetyl-CoA and pregnenolone, using different acyl donors or different steroid substrates, the semi-purified APAT transfers the acetate on 30-ol, delta4 or deltas-steroids with comparable efficiency whereas transfer is slight on oestrogens and not detectable on sterols and with a marked preference for acetyl-CoA as acyl donor.<br>
Table 2 below, in which for a) the tests are effected with 30 fj.M of each steroid tested and 100 fj,M of [3H] acetyl-CoA and for b) the tests are effected with 100 /iM of each acyl donor and 30 /zM of [3H] pregnenolone, shows the results obtained:<br><br>
b) Inhibited <br>
The APAT activity is strongly inhibited by reagents of sulfhydryl groups such as NEM and DTNB.  Inhibition is complete in the presence of zinc chloride (1 mM). D - Partial amino acid sequence.<br>
The partial amino acid sequence was determined after digestion with trypsin on gel sections according to the method described by Rosenfeld et al. (1992) .<br>
Starting from two thirds of the concentrate obtained above then separated by SDS-PAGE, the 62 kDa band was cut out then incubated with trypsin (Promega).  The peptides generated were<br>
then separated by RP-HPLC on a Vydac 218TP column (1.5 x 125 mm) at a rate of 100 /il/min, using a linear gradient of acetonitrile varying from 0 to 60% in 80 min, then from 60 to 100% in 20 min in a 0.1% TFA solution in water and were then submitted to amino acid sequencing.<br>
The N-terminal sequence was determined on a Model 477A protein sequencer connected to an HPLC analyser of PTH-amino acids (Applied Biosystems).<br>
Among the samples sequenced, two peaks x and y give an unambiguous sequence made up respectively of the following 10 and 16 amino acids: for peak x :  ISEQFKKDDF for peak y :  LIELISPVIIPLGNPK<br>
The two peptide sequences thus obtained were used for screening the database of the genome of S. cerevisiae.  A protein of 62 kDa whose sequence contains exactly the sequences of the above two peptides was identified (Mips, accession S64491, Hebling et al., May 1996).  This protein whose sequence is shown in Figure 4 and whose function has not been described would be coded by a gene at locus YGR177c.  On the basis of identity of about 37% of the amino acid sequence between the protein of the invention possessing acyltransferase activity and the product of the ATF1 gene in S. cerevisiae described by Fujii et al. (1994) and to which an alcohol acetyltransferase has been attributed, we shall use the designation ATF2 for the gene coding for the protein responsible for APAT activity in S. cerevisiae.<br>
EXAMPLE 2;  Construction of yeast strains possessing the ATF2 gene disrupted by the URA3 gene and which have lost APAT activity (atf2-A::URA3). A) Targeting of the ATF2 gene.<br>
The URA3 gene of S. cerevisiae was introduced by substitution of a selected part of the ATF2 gene of S. cerevisiae permitting subsequent selection of mutant strains by prototrophy with uracil.<br>
The URA3 selection marker was combined with the ATF2 gene by double fusion PCR according to the method described by Amberg et al., 1995.  The strategy followed, shown in Figure 5,<br>
comprises a total of 4 PCR reactions.  The first two reactions (designated PCR1) permit, respectively, amplification of the 5' and 3' regions flanking the insertion site of the URA3 marker in the ATF2 target gene that is disrupted, and the third reaction (designated PCR2) permits amplification of the URA3 marker gene.  Double fusion (designated PCR3) finally permits combining of the 5' and 3' regions of the ATF2 target gene with the URA3 marker gene (designated 5'ATF2-URA3-3'ATF2) .<br>
Firstly, a sample of intact cells of the Fyl679 strain used as source of DNA of the ATF2 target gene was amplified in the PCR buffer containing 2 mM dNTP (Pharmacia) in the following conditions:  25 cycles; 93°C, 30 s;  54°C, 2 min; 68°C, 3 min followed by an extension of 5 min at 72 °C; polymerase Ampli Taq (Perkin Elmer).<br>
On the one hand, the 5' region of the ATF2 gene was amplified by PCR using, as direct and indirect primers, the oligonucleotides possessing the following sequences: OTG10 841:  AAAAGTCGACAAAATGGAAGATATAGAAGGATACGAACCACATATCACTC (SEQ ID N°l) and<br>
OTG10844: ATCAATCTCCAATTAGGCCTCTTCGGATTACCC (SEQ ID N°2) which contain a region homologous to the 5' region of the sequence of the ATF2 gene (SGD: YGR177c) and by adding a restriction site Sail for the OTG10841.<br>
On the other hand, the 3' region of the ATF2 gene was amplified by PCR using, as direct and indirect primers, the oligonucleotides possessing the following sequences: OTG10846:  CATTCGACATTCCCGAAGGTGACAATGACAAG (SEQ ID N°3) and<br>
OTG10842:  AAAAACGCGTAACTATTAAAGCGACGCAAATTCGCCGATGGTTTGG (SEQ ID N°4)<br>
which contain regions homologous to the 3' region of the sequence of the ATF2 gene (SGD:  YGR177c) and by adding a restriction site Mlul for OTG10842.<br>
Secondly, the URA3 gene of S. cerevisiae was amplified by PCR, using as direct primer the oligonucleotide possessing the sequence: OTG10843:<br>
GGGTAATCCGAAGAGGCCTAATTGGAGATTGATAAGCTTTTCAATTCAATTCATCATTTTT TTTTTATTCTTTTTTTTG (SEQ ID N°5)<br>
which contains a sequence homologous to the 5' region of the published sequence of the URA3 gene (Rose et al., 1984; GenBank: YSCODCD accession : K02207;  SGD: YEL021w) combined with a sequence homologous to the 5' region of the ATF2 gene (complementary to OTG10844) and as indirect primer the oligonucleotide possessing the sequence: OTG10845:<br>
CTTGTCATTGTCACCTTCGGGAATGTCGAATGGGGTAATAACTGATATAATTAAATTGAACTC (SEQ ID N°6)<br>
which contains a sequence homologous to the 3' region of the URA3 gene combined with a sequence homologous to the 3' region of the ATF2 gene (complementary to OTG10846).  A 20 ng sample of DNA of the URA3 gene, isolated from the shuttle vector E. coli-yeast pTG10021 (Degryse et al., 1995) by digestion with the restriction enzyme HindiII was amplified in the conditions stated above.<br>
The PCR products respectively obtained were purified using the "Geneclean kit" (Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, USA), then submitted to the double fusion reaction, using as primers the aforementioned oligonucleotides OTG10841 and OTG10842 in the amplification conditions used for the previous PCR reactions with a programme of 20 cycles.<br>
After purification of the final fusion product which contains the regions flanking the ATF2 gene fused to the functional URA3 gene, the presence of the URA3 gene was confirmed by digestion with the EcoRV restriction enzyme which shows the presence of this site in the amplified material. B) Generation of yeast strains atf2-A::URA3.<br>
The fusion product obtained above was transformed directly in the competent cells of strain Fyl679 or of strain TGY73.4 and the transformants were selected by growth on SD medium (F. Sherman, 1991) in the presence of the nutritional requirements of the strain and in the absence of uracil.<br>
Starting from isolated clones, the new combination between the 5' region of the ATF2 gene and the URA3 gene (5'ATF2-URA3-3'ATF2) was demonstrated by PCR amplification on the intact<br>
cells using the aforementioned primers OTG10841 and OTG10845. Absence of APAT activity was then demonstrated in vitro according to the test described on the basis of the cell homogenate, in comparison with the parent strain which shows marked APAT activity.<br>
The strains meeting these criteria were thus characterized as atf2 mutant strains, designated atf2-A::URA3.  A mutant strain thus obtained starting from the parent strain Fyl679 was designated TGY156 and a mutant strain obtained starting from the parent strain TGY73.4 was designated TGY158.<br>
A sample of strain TGY156 was lodged at the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM) INSTITUT PASTEUR, 25, Rue du Docteur Roux 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15 FRANCE, on 2 February 1998 under number 1-1977.<br>
A sample of strain TGY158 was lodged at the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM) INSTITUT PASTEUR, 25, Rue du Docteur Roux 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15 FRANCE, on 2 February 1998 under number 1-1976.<br>
C) Stabilization of pregnenolone in vivo in cultures of yeast strains atf2-A::URA3.<br>
The cells of strain TGY158 obtained above were inoculated at A600 = 0.1 in YPD medium (Difco) containing 100 /ig/ml of pregnenolone.  After 16 hours of incubation at 28°C, the steroids were extracted with dichloromethane and analysed by RP-HPLC as stated above.  Figure 6(B) shows that the mutant TGY158 has lost the ability to esterify pregnenolone whereas in the same culture conditions, the parent strain TGY73.4 converts pregnenolone to pregnenolone acetate (Figure 6(A)).<br>
It can be concluded on the basis of these results that the product of the ATF2 gene is responsible for esterification of pregnenolone by the yeast whereas interruption of the ATF2 gene did not lead to evident changes in cell growth in normal conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE 3;  Construction of a yeast strain possessing the ATF2 gene disrupted by the URA3 gene and expressing 3P-HSD<br>
2/x plasmids bearing a cDNA sequence coding for human 30-HSD under the control of the CYC1 promoter of S. cerevisiae or of the TEF1 promoter of S. cerevisiae and bearing the G418<br>
resistance gene were constructed according to the scheme in Figures 7A to 1C, then transformed into mutant yeast strains atf2-A: :URA3.<br>
Firstly, a transfer vector pTG10095, containing the cDNA sequence coding for type II human 3(3-HSD described by E. Rheaume et al., 1991 flanked by the Sail and Mlul sites and located downstream of the yeast promoter GAL10/CYC1, was generated in the following manner:<br>
The sequence coding for 3J3-HSD was subcloned by E. Rheaume et al., 1991 as a restriction fragment SalI-Wotl at the same sites of the vector Bluescript II (Stratagene).  The vector obtained, described by E. Rheaume et al., 1991 contains a WotI site located at the 3' end of the sequence coding for 3(3-HSD. This vector was then digested by the WotI restriction enzyme, and treated by the Klenow fragment in the presence of dNTP in order to fill the cohesive ends, then re-ligated in the presence of the oligonucleotide possessing the following sequence:<br>
OTG4461:  CACACGCGTGTG (SEQ ID N°7)<br>
previously phosphorylated and hybridized on itself, so as to introduce a site Mlul.  The vector pTG10082 (Figure 7A) thus obtained contains the sequence coding for 3(i-HSD containing a Bgrlll site and edged with the Sail and Mlul sites, whereas the WotI site'was lost.  This vector still contains the natural non-coding region 5' identified by the presence of a Bgrlll site.<br>
In order to bring the Sail site closer to the initiator ATG upstream of which we wish to introduce the GAL10/CYC1 promoter, the vector pTG10082 was digested with the MscI restriction enzyme whose site is located in the non-coding 5' region and just upstream of the initiator ATG and by the Mlul restriction enzyme.  The MscI-Mlul fragment, of 1.8 kb, containing the sequence coding for 3P-HSD (Figure 7A), was isolated then ligated in the pTG10033 plasmid (E. Degryse et al., 1995) containing the GAL10/CYC1 promoter, previously digested by the Sail restriction enzyme, then digested by the Mlul restriction enzyme.  The pTG10095 vector (Figure 7B) is thus obtained.<br>
Secondly, the recombination vector pTG10268 containing the 2/i plasmid of yeast, a replicon of E. coli, a CYClprom-PGKterm expression cassette and the selection marker LEU2 (Figure 7B) was constructed.  This vector is identical to the vector pTG10159 described (E. Degryse et al., 1995), apart from the Xbal site contained in the 2ju region which was replaced by a marker Xbal0 obtained by filling of the natural site Xbal in the presence of the Klenow fragment, then by re-ligating.<br>
The pTG10268 expression plasmid was then generated by homologous recombination by introduction of the expression block containing the promoter GALlO/CYClp, obtained starting from the plasmid pTG10095 prepared above then digested by the NotI restriction enzyme, in the plasmid pTG10260 previously digested by the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul.  The plasmid pTG10268 (Figure 7B) contains the sequence coding for type II human 3(3-HSD under the control of the promoter CYC1.<br>
The expression plasmid pTG10862 containing the sequence coding for 3P-HSD under the control of the promoter TEF1 was then constructed in the following way (Figure 7C):<br>
The plasmid pTG10832 (Figure 8) was first constructed by homologous recombination between the NotI fragment obtained from the plasmid pTG10268 prepared above, then digested by the NotI restriction enzyme and the recombination plasmid pTG10164 (E. Degryse et al., 1995) previously digested by the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul.<br>
The expression plasmid pTG10862 was then obtained by introduction of the promoter TEF1, contained in the Clal-Sall fragment isolated from the plasmid pTG10085 (E. Degryse et al., 1995), in place of the promoter CYC1 excised by digestion of the plasmid pTG10832 constructed above by the restriction enzymes Clal and Sail.<br>
The plasmid pTG10862 thus obtained (Figure 9) and containing the cDNA sequence coding for type II human 3P-HSD was transformed respectively in the parent strain TGY73.4 or in its mutant atf2-A::URA3 corresponding to the strain TGY158 obtained in Example 2 as well as in the parent strain FY1G79 or in its mutant atf2-A:: URA3 corresponding to the strain TGY156 obtained in Example 2.  The transform ants were isolated as<br>
stated above on YPD medium (Difco) containing G418 at 250 /ig/ml.<br>
The candidate colonies thus obtained were then precultivated on the SD medium containing the nutritional elements necessary for each strain (histidine and uracil for strain TGY73.4;  histidine for TGY 158;  tryptophan, histidine, leucine and uracil for strain FY1679;  tryptophan, histidine and leucine for strain TGY156;  each at a concentration of 100 /ig/ml) , then inoculated in a medium containing 100 /xg/ml of pregnenolone.  After 24 h of growth and bioconversion at 28°C, the steroids were extracted and measured by RP-HPLC as stated above.  The results obtained, measured on 3 clones from each strain, are shown in Table 3 below:<br><br>
The results show that the substrate pregnenolone is recovered almost quantitatively in the mutant strains TGY156 or TGY158 in which commencement of bioconversion of pregnenolone to progesterone is observed whereas the disappearance of pregnenolone is complete in the parent strains TGY73.4 or FY1679 which produce very little if any progesterone, but accumulate pregnenolone acetate as was shown in Example 2.<br>
A sample of the modified strain TGY158/pTG10862 was lodged at the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM) INSTITUT PASTEUR, 25, Rue du Docteur Roux 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15 FRANCE, on 2 February 1998 under number 1-1978. Example 4;  Construction of a yeast strain possessing the ATF2 gene disrupted by TEFlproa/PGKtentt (atf2-A: : TEF1/PGK) .<br>
Strain TGY186, which is a strain derived from strain TGY156 (atf2-A::URA3) described in Example 2 in which the URA3<br>
gene at the ATF2 locus has been replaced by the expression block TEFlprom/PGKcerm, was constructed as follows:<br>
Firstly, the expression block TEFlpron,/PGKterm was combined with the ATF2 gene by double fusion PCR following the conditions described in Example 2, but using the expression block TEFlprom/PGKterm of S. cerevisiae described by E. Degryse et al., 1995 instead of the URA3 selection marker.<br>
The first two PCR reactions (PCR1), permitting, respectively, amplification of the 5' and 3' coding regions of the ATF2 gene flanking the insertion site of the TEFlprom/PGKcerm block in the ATF2 disrupted target gene, were carried out using respectively, as direct and indirect primers for the 5' region, the oligonucleotides possessing the following sequences: OTG11049:<br>
CTCTCTGTCGACATGGAAGATATAGAAGGATACGAACCACATATCACTC (SEQ ID N°8) and<br>
OTG10844:  ATCAATCTCCAATTAGGCCTCTTCGGATTACCC (SEQ ID N°9) for the 3' region, the oligonucleotides possessing the following sequences:<br>
OTG10846:  CATTCGACATTCCCGAAGGTGACAATGACAAG. (SEQ ID N°10) and OTG11050:  AACAACACGCGTAACTATTAAAGCGACGCAAATTCGCCGATGCTTTGG (SEQ ID N°ll).<br>
The primers OTG11049 and OTG11050 were designated for introducing, respectively, the restriction sites Sail and Mlul.<br>
The third PCR reaction (PCR2) permitting amplification of the TEFlprom/PGKterm block was effected using, respectively as direct and indirect primers, the oligonucleotides possessing the following sequences: OTG11052:<br>
GGGTAATCCGAAGAGGCCTAATTGGAGATTGATATCGATCACACACCATAGCTTCAAAATG TTTCTAC (SEQ ID N°12) and OTG11053:<br>
CTTGTCATTGTCACCTTCGGGAATGTCGAATCTTCGAAACGCAGAATTTTCGAGTTATTAA ACTTAA (SEQ ID N°13) which introduce the restriction sites Clal and Hindlll.<br>
Finally, combination was effected by double fusion of the PCR products obtained above, using as primers the oligonucleotides possessing the sequences OTG11049 (SEQ ID N°8)<br>
and OTG11050 (SEQ ID N°ll) above, which introduce the restriction sites Sail and Mlul at the ATF2 junction sites.<br>
After purification, the final fusion product was then recombined with the ATF2 gene contained in the plasmid pTG10885 constructed as indicated below and previously digested with the restriction enzymes BstI and StuI.  The plasmid pTG10888, containing the TEFlprom/PGKterm signal at the Clal and Hindi 11 sites edged by the flanking regions of the ATF2 gene, is thus obtained.<br>
Preparation of the plasmid pTG10885 comprises<br>
amplification of the ATF2 gene starting from the FY1679 strain and following the conditions described in Example 2, but using, respectively as direct and indirect primers, the oligonucleotides possessing the sequences OTG11049 (SEQ ID N°8) and OTG11050 (SEQ ID N°ll) above, which introduce restriction sites Sail and Mlul.  In the PCR product obtained, these sites were then eliminated by digestion with the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul, then treatment with the Klenow fragment of polymerase I of E. coli, so as to fill the sticky ends.  The fragment obtained was then ligated in the expression vector pTG10031 described by E. Degryse et al., 1995 digested beforehand with enzymes Clal and Hindlll, then treated with the Klenow fragment.  By transformation in E. coli, the plasmid pTG10885 is thus obtained, resulting from ligation of the Sail site of the PCR product, filled by using the Klenow fragment so as to obtain the sequence GTCGA with the HindiII site of the vector, filled by using the Klenow fragment so as to obtain the sequence AGCTT so as to reconstruct the HindiII site (GTCGAAGCTT) (SEQ ID N°14) and lose the Clal site. The Clal site of the vector, filled by using the Klenow fragment so as to obtain the sequence ATCG is lost after ligation to the PCR product.<br>
The TEFlprom/PGKterm signal was then excised from plasmid pTG10888 in the form of a NotI fragment of 1.8 kb, then was exchanged with the URA3 marker in strain TGY156 (atf2-A::URA3).<br>
Strain TGY156, prepared in Example 2, used as host strain, was co-transformed with the DNA excised from plasmid pTG10888<br>
and with the yeast vector containing an ARS origin, designated YRp7, described by Struhl et al., 1979 which makes it possible to supplement the tryptophan requirement of strain TGY156 and selective detection of colonies from their resistance to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FO).<br>
2 to 5 p.g of the DNA excised from plasmid pTG10888 by digestion with the NotI restriction enzyme and from plasmid YRp7 were introduced into strain TGY156 by the lithium acetate method (Ito et al., 1983).  Selection for the supplementation for a requirement for tryptophan of the strain was then effected after spreading on dishes of agar in YNGB medium (Difco) enriched with histidine and leucine (100 /-tg/ml of each).  The candidate colonies, collected using a toothpick, were then placed on a medium containing 5-FO prepared according to Boeke et al., 1984 then the resistance to 5-FO was confirmed on the same medium, any loss of the YRp7 vector in those resistant to 5-FO being indicated by a requirement for tryptophan.  Among the clones thus selected, combination of the ATF2 gene with TEFlprom and PGKterm was monitored by PCR.  Strain TGY186 is thus obtained.<br>
Example 5;  Construction of a yeast strain possessing the ATF2 gene disrupted by TEFlproa/PGKtazm and expressing P45017a.<br>
A plasmid (pTG10435) containing a yeast replication origin ARSH4/CEN6, the URA3 selection marker and bearing a cDNA sequence coding for the bovine cytochrome P45017a under the control of the TEF1 promoter of S. cerevisiae was constructed according to the scheme in Figure 10, then transformed in a mutant yeast strain atf2-A: .-TEF1/PGK (TGY186) .  Firstly, a plasmid pTG10058 containing the cDNA sequence coding for the bovine cytochrome P45017a described by Zuber et al. , 1986, flanked by the Sail and Mlul sites and situated downstream of the yeast promoter CYC1, was generated according to the scheme in Figure 11:  The plasmid pGB17a-5 described in patent application WO 89/10963 and containing the sequence coding for the bovine cytochrome P45017a was opened by digestion with the Xhol restriction enzyme then treated with alkaline phosphatase. After phosphorylation and hybridization, the oligonucleotides possessing the following sequences:<br>
OTG4511:  TCGACGGACGCGTGG (SEQ ID N°15) and OTG4512:  TCGACCACGCGTCCG (SEQ ID N°16)<br>
were introduced in the Xhol site generating the plasmid pTG10104.  The plasmid pTG10104 was then treated with the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul, then introduced in the plasmid pTG10031 described by E. Degryse et al., 1995 containing the yeast promoter CYC1, previously digested with the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul and treated with alkaline phosphatase.  The pTG10058 vector containing the cDNA coding for the bovine cytochrome P45017a is thus obtained (Figure 12). The plasmid pTG10058 was then digested by the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The Sail-Mlul fragment of 1.7 kb containing the sequence coding for the bovine cytochrome P45017cc was isolated, then ligated in the expression vector pTG10085 described by E. Degryse et al., 1995 and containing the yeast promoter TEF1, previously digested with the enzymes Sail and Mlul.  The plasmid pTG 10293 (Figure 13) in which the sequence coding for the cytochrome P45017a is under the control of the promoter TEF1 is thus obtained.<br>
Secondly, the expression plasmid pTG10435 was generated by homologous recombination between the recombination plasmid pTG10434 described by E. Degryse et al. 1995 and containing the sequence ARSH4/CEN6, previously digested by the enzymes Sail and Mlul and the NotI fragment of 2.8 kb obtained starting from the plasmid pTG10293 prepared above.<br>
The plasmid pTG10435 thus obtained (Figure 14) and containing the sequence coding for the bovine cytochrome P45017oc under the control of the promoter TEF1, was then transformed respectively in the parent strain FY1679 or in strain TGY186 (atf2-A: .-TEF1/PGK) prepared in Example 4.  The transformants were isolated as stated above on YNBG medium (Difco) enriched with tryptophan, histidine and leucine (100 /xg/ml of each) . The colonies thus obtained were then precultivated for 16 hours in YNB medium (Difco) containing 2% of glucose and 0.5% of casaminoacids, then diluted in fresh medium to A600=0.2.  After 6 hours of growth, 100/z/ml of pregnenolone or of progesterone was added.  After 48 hours of growth and bioconversion at 28°C,<br>
the steroids were extracted and measured by RP-HPLC as indicated in Example 1 using, respectively, standards of pregnenolone and of 17a-hydroxypregnenolone or of progesteror.e and of 17a-hydroxyprogesterone.<br>
The results obtained expressed in ^g/ml are shown in Takle 4 below:<br>
resuliB show that the capacity for bioconversion oE<br>
rvtoohroma   axeareeocd   ohn-rhin {mm   4-h--.   -way is  nearly cne adiue  in the wild-type  strain   (FY)   or  in its mutant  atf2   (TGY186)   with progesterone as substrate.     On the other hand,   with pregnenolone as  substrate,   the same bioconversion is  obtained in comparison with progesterone but only with the mutant atf2   (TGY186) .     In the wild-type strain PY,   both the  substrate and the product are acetylated and no free hydroxyprogesterone is detected.<br>
A sample of  the modified strain TGY186/pTG10435 was lodgod at  the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganistnes (CNCM)   INSTITUT PASTEUR,   25,   Rue du Docteur Roux 75724  PARIS CEDEX 15  FRANCE,   on 20 January 1999  under the  number  1-2119,<br>
Example  61     Construction of a yeast  strain possessing  the ATFI' gene disrupted by TEFlfrm/PGKttia and co-expressing 30-HSD and<br>
The plasmid pTG10417   (Figure 21)   containing the yeast coil 2n and two expression blocks,   one  coding for human 3(3 HSD,   the other coding  for bovine  cytochrome  P15817a,   and both under the control of the promoter CYC1 of 5.   cerevisiae and<br>
bearing the URA3-d selection marker was constructed following<br>
successively stages 1 to 3 described below (Figures ISA and B),<br>
then stages 4 to 6 described below, then transformed in a<br>
mutant yeast strain atf2-A::TEFlprom/PGKeezm (TGY186).<br>
Stage 1:  construction of the plasmid pTG10210<br>
The expression vector pTG10033 described by E. Degryse et al.,<br>
1995 and containing the hybrid yeast promoter GAL10/CYC1,<br>
previously digested by the restriction enzyme PvuII, was<br>
treated with alkaline phosphatase then re-ligated in the<br>
presence of the oligonucleotide that has the following<br>
sequence:<br>
OTG1050:  CCCGAATTCGGG (SEQ ID N°17)<br>
previously phosphorylated and hybridized on itself so as to<br>
introduce EcoRI sites at the edge of the expression block<br>
containing the promoter GAL10/CYC1.  The vector pTG10210 is<br>
thus obtained.<br>
Stage 2:  construction of the plasmid pTG10214<br>
The expression block containing the promoter GAL10/CYC1 present<br>
in the vector pTG10210 was then introduced in the E. coli-yeast<br>
shuttle vector pTG10013 described by E. Degryse et al., 1995<br>
and containing the selection marker URA3-d.<br>
The vector pTG10013, after digestion with the EcoRI restriction<br>
enzyme and treatment with alkaline phosphatase, was ligated in<br>
the vector pTG10210 prepared in stage 1, previously digested<br>
with the enzyme EcoRI.  The vector pTG10214 thus obtained<br>
contains the expression block containing the promoter<br>
GAL10/CYC1 directed towards the 2p. replicon.<br>
Stage 3:  construction of the plasmid pTG10274<br>
In plasmid pTG10214, the promoter GAL10/CYC1 was then exchanged<br>
with the promoter CYC1 by homologous recombination after<br>
excision of the plasmid by treatment with the restriction<br>
enzymes Clal and Sail.  The expression vector pTG10031<br>
described by E. Degryse et al., 1995 and containing the<br>
promoter CYC1 was digested by the restriction enzymes Hindlll<br>
and Fspl, then recombined with the plasmid pTG10214 prepared in<br>
stage 2 and previously digested with the restriction enzymes<br>
Clal and Sail, thus generating the plasmid pTG10274 (Figure<br>
16) .<br>
Stage 4:  construction of the plasmid pTG10401<br>
Starting from the plasmid pTG10274 containing the promoter CYC1 and the plasmid pTG10293 containing the sequence coding for the cytochrome P45017a under the control of the promoter TEF1, a new plasmid pTG10401 containing the sequence coding for the cytochrome P45017a under the control of the promoter TEF1 was then generated by homologous recombination.<br>
The promoter CYC1 and a part of the replicon of E. coli were excised from the plasmid pTG10274, prepared in stage 3, by digestion with the restriction enzymes Mlul and Dral.  The plasmid pTG10293, prepared in Example 5, was digested with the restriction enzymes HindiII and PvuII, then recombined with the plasmid pTG10274 digested with the restriction enzymes Mlul and Dral generating the plasmid pTG10401 (Figure 17). Stage 5:  construction of the plasmid pTG10403<br>
The cDNA coding for type II human 3P-HSD was then introduced in the plasmid pTG10401 under the control of the promoter CYC1. Firstly, the expression vector pTG10262 containing the cDNA coding for type II human 3(3-HSD was constructed according to the scheme in Figure 18, starting from the transfer vector pTG10095 prepared in Example 3 and the recombination vector pTG10257 containing the yeast replicon 2\i, a replicon from E. coli, the expression cassette of yeast CYClprom-PGKterm and a URA3-d selection marker.  This vector pTG10257 is identical to the recombination vector pTG10042 described by E. Degryse et al. , 1995, apart from the site Xbal contained in the 2p. region and which is replaced by a marker Xbal° obtained by filling the natural site Xbal with the Klenow fragment and then re-ligating.<br>
The expression block of the type II human 3P-HSD was excised from the transfer vector pTG10095 by digestion with the restriction enzyme NotI, then introduced in the recombination vector pTG10257 previously digested with the restriction enzymes Sail and Mlul, generating the expression vector pTG10262 (Figure 19).  It should be noted that recombination of the block GALlO/CYCl-cDNA originating from plasmid pTG10095 in the recombination vector pTG10257 containing the promoter CYC1 produces an expression vector containing the block CYCl-cDNA.<br>
Secondly, the expression vector pTG10262, prepared above, was digested with the restriction enzyme XrnnI.  The fragment obtained containing the cDNA coding for 3[3-HSD was recombined with the fragment of plasmid pTG10401 prepared in stage 4 containing the cDNA coding for the cytochrome P45017a obtained by digestion with the restriction enzyme SealI.  The plasmid pTG10403 (Figure 20) thus obtained contains two expression blocks, one coding for 3p-HSDH under the control of the promoter CYC1, the other coding for the cytochrome P45017<x under the control of promoter tefl. stage construction plasmid ptg10417></x>
Finally, in the above plasmid pTG10403, the promoter TEFl was exchanged with the promoter CYC1.<br>
On the one hand, the plasmid pTG10058 described in Example 5 was digested with the restriction enzyme PvuII, which makes it possible to release a part of the sequence coding for the cytochrome P45017a combined with the promoter CYC1 as well as most of the replicon of E. coli.  On the other hand, part of the replicon of E. coli was eliminated from the plasmid pTG10403 prepared in stage 5 by digestion with the restriction enzyme Oral.  By recombination of the two plasmids previously digested in this way, the plasmid pTG10417 is finally obtained. The plasmid pTG10417 contains the yeast replicon 2/i, the URA3-d selection marker and the two expression blocks, one coding for human 3(3-HSD, the other coding for the cytochrome P45017a of bovine origin, both under the control of the yeast promoter CYC1 (Figure 21).<br>
The plasmid pTG10417 was then transformed respectively in the parent strain FY1679 or in strain TGY186 (atf2-A: : TEFlprom/PGKterm] prepared in Example 4.<br>
The transformants were isolated on agar-treated YNB medium (Difco), containing 0.5% of glucose, enriched with tryptophan, histidine and leucine (100 /ig/ml each) .<br>
The colonies thus obtained were then precultivated for 24 hours at 28°C in the YNB medium (Difco) containing 0.5% of glucose and 0.1% of casaminoacids, then diluted to A600=0.1 and supplemented with pregnenolone at 100 /zg/ml, either in the same fresh medium (medium 1) , or in the YNB medium (Difco)<br>
containing 0.1% of glucol, 2% of glycerol and 0.2% of casaminoacids (medium 2).  After 48 hours of growth and bioconversion, the steroids were extracted and measured by RP-HPLC as indicated in Example 1 using the standards of pregnenolone, 17ct-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone.<br>
The results obtained, expressed in /xg/ml, are shown in Table 5 (medium 1) and Table 6 (medium 2) below:<br><br>
These results show that bioconversion in the wild-type strain (FY) transformed by the plasmid pTG10417 leads to accumulation of pregnenolone acetate and of 17a-hydroxypregnenolone acetate which are not transformed subsequently by the enzymes 3P-HSDH or P45017oc and that the balance of bioconversion is lower than that observed with the<br>
transformed at£2 mutant (TGY186).<br>
A sample of the transformed strain TGYl86/pTG10417 was lodged with the Collection Nationals de Cultures de Microorganiames (CNCM) INSTITUT PASTEUR, 25, Rue du Docteur Roux 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15 FRANCE, on 20 January 1999 under the<br>
