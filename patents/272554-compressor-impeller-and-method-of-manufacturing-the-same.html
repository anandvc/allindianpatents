				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPRESSOR IMPELLER AND METHOD OF<br>
MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a compressor<br>
impeller used at an intake side of a supercharger,<br>
which makes use of exhaust gas from an internal<br>
combustion engine to feed a compressed air, and a<br>
method of manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In a supercharger incorporated in an internal<br>
combustion engine of, for example, an automobile, ships<br>
and vessels, a turbine impeller at an exhaust side is<br>
caused to rotate with utilization of exhaust gas from<br>
an internal combustion engine, thereby rotating a<br>
coaxial compressor impeller at an intake side, or by<br>
rotating the coaxial compressor impeller, to suck and<br>
compress an outside air and to supply the compressed<br>
air to the internal combustion engine to increase an<br>
output of the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0003]<br>
Since a turbine impeller used for the<br>
supercharger described above is exposed to high<br>
temperature exhaust gas discharged from an internal<br>
combustion engine, super alloys of Ni-base, Co-base,<br>
Fe-base, etc. proposed in, for example, JP-A-58-70961<br>
(Patent Publication 1) have been conventionally used<br>
therefor. In recent years, titanium alloys and<br>
aluminum alloys have been also used.<br>
On the other hand, a compressor impeller is<br>
positioned in a location at which an outside air is<br>
sucked, and used in a temperature environment in the<br>
order of 100°C to 150°C. Therefore, aluminum alloys are<br>
conventionally have been used much for the compressor<br>
impeller instead of alloys having heat high resistance<br>
like as super alloys being used for the turbine<br>
impeller described above.<br>
[0004]<br>
In recent years, various examinations have<br>
been made for further high speed rotation of a turbine<br>
impeller and a compressor impeller with a view to an<br>
improvement in combustion efficiency of an internal<br>
combustion engine. In rotating an impeller at high<br>
speed, it is desired that, in particular, a compressor<br>
impeller be high in strength (referred below to as<br>
specific strength) per unit density, that is,<br>
lightweight and high in strength. Also, it is<br>
predicted that a temperature environment at the time of<br>
high speed rotation will rise to a temperature beyond<br>
180°C to 200°C, and it is therefore desired that the<br>
impeller have a favorable toughness, be further high in<br>
strength, and can be maintained high in strength even<br>
when a temperature environment exceeds 200°C.<br>
[0005]<br>
In the light of such background, a compressor<br>
impeller proposed by, for example, JP-A-20003-94148<br>
(Patent Publication 2) is being put to practical use,<br>
which is made of a titanium alloy to be able to be made<br>
more lightweight than that made of the Ni heat<br>
resistant alloy, etc. and to be higher in strength than<br>
that made of a conventional aluminum alloy.<br>
[0006]<br>
Generally, a compressor impeller is complex<br>
in shape such that a plurality of blade parts having an<br>
aerodynamically curved surface are arranged radially<br>
around a hub shaft part on a hub surface of a hub disk<br>
part extending radially of the hub shaft part being a<br>
rotational center axle. Also, there are also existent<br>
an impeller including a blade part composed of full<br>
blades and splitter blades and an impeller having a<br>
complex shape, in which an undercut extends radially<br>
outwardly of a hub shaft part.<br>
[0007]<br>
A compressor impeller having such complex<br>
shape is formed by measures such as machining, by which<br>
a blade part is cut from an impeller material,<br>
deformation and straightening of a blade part after an<br>
impeller material having a shape affording casting is<br>
once formed, as proposed by JP-A-57-171004 (Patent<br>
Publication 3), or the like. Also, there is also<br>
existent a method, in which an sacrificial pattern<br>
having a blade part and a hub part of an impeller made<br>
integral is formed in a die by means of the plaster<br>
mold process, the lost wax casting process and used to<br>
fabricate a casting mold, and a molten metal is cast<br>
into the casting mold to form an impeller. In this<br>
case, for example, the Patent Document 2 and JP-A-2002-<br>
113749 (Patent Document 4) propose a die structure to<br>
release blade parts from a die, in which an sacrificial<br>
pattern is formed.<br>

Patent Publication 1: JP-A-58-70961<br>
Patent Publication 2: JP-A-2003-94148<br>

Patent Publication 4: JP-A-2002-113749<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]<br>
In order to rotate a compressor impeller at<br>
higher speed than conventional, a conventional impeller<br>
made of an aluminum alloy is not sufficient in terms of<br>
mechanical strength such as specific strength, etc.<br>
Also, since an impeller made of a titanium alloy is<br>
sufficient in strength and specific strength even in a<br>
temperature zone exceeding 200°C, it is assuredly suited<br>
to a compressor impeller. However, a titanium alloy is<br>
very expensive as compared with an aluminum alloy,<br>
which presents a factor to impede the spread.<br>
[0010]<br>
Also, with respect to measures of manufacture<br>
of a compressor impeller, measures of machining such as<br>
cutting of an impeller material, etc. are high in<br>
manufacturing cost to be disadvantageous in terms of<br>
machining time and material yield. Also, with measures<br>
of form adjustment of a blade part of a cast compressor<br>
impeller, it is hard to obtain a favorable form<br>
accuracy, which makes it difficult to ensure a balance<br>
in rotation. While a relatively favorable form<br>
accuracy is obtained with the plaster mold process and<br>
the lost wax casting process, dissatisfaction in terms<br>
of production efficiency and manufacturing cost remains<br>
in forming an impeller through the medium of an<br>
sacrificial pattern and manufacturing an sacrificial<br>
pattern and a casting mold every casting, or the like.<br>
[0011]<br>
An object of the invention is to solve the<br>
problems described above and to provide a compressor<br>
impeller, which is larger in specific strength than a<br>
conventional impeller made of an aluminum alloy, lower<br>
in cost than an impeller made of a titanium alloy, and<br>
can accommodate further high-speed rotation.<br>
MEASURE FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0012]<br>
The present inventors have reached the<br>
invention finding that a compressor impeller made of a<br>
magnesium alloy can be manufactured by the die-casting<br>
process.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the<br>
invention, there is provided a compressor impeller,<br>
which is made of a magnesium alloy and is a die-cast<br>
product, comprising a hub shaft part, a hub disk part<br>
having a hub surface extending from the hub shaft part<br>
in a radial direction, and a plurality of blade parts<br>
provided on the hub surface.<br>
In the compressor impeller, the plurality of<br>
blade parts may consist of alternately adjacent full<br>
blades and splitter blades. Also, in the compressor<br>
impeller, an undercut extending radially outwardly from<br>
the hub shaft part may be present in respective blade<br>
spaces defined between a pair of adjacent full blades.<br>
[0013]<br>
Also, according to a second aspect of the<br>
invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing<br>
a compressor impeller by a die-casting process, in<br>
which:<br>
a magnesium alloy heated to a liquidus<br>
temperature or higher is supplied into dies defining a<br>
cavity corresponding to the shape of the compressor<br>
impeller for a filling time of 1 sec. or shorter, the<br>
compressor impeller comprising a hub shaft part, a hub<br>
disk part having a hub surface extending from the hub<br>
shaft part in a radial direction, and a plurality of<br>
blade parts provided on the hub surface,<br>
a pressure of not less than 20 MPa is<br>
consecutively applied to the magnesium alloy in the<br>
cavity, and<br>
the pressurized state is maintained for a<br>
time of not less than 1 sec.<br>
According to an embodiment of the<br>
manufacturing method of the invention, in the<br>
compressor impeller, the plurality of blade parts may<br>
consist of alternately adjacent full blades and<br>
splitter blades. Also, in the compressor impeller, an<br>
undercut extending radially outwardly from the hub<br>
shaft part may be present in respective blade spaces<br>
formed between a pair of adjacent full blades.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to a further embodiment of the<br>
manufacturing method of the invention, a pressure in<br>
the cavity is preferably reduced to 0.5 MPa or lower<br>
after the lapse of the pressurization maintaining time.<br>
According to a still further embodiment of<br>
the manufacturing method of the invention, the cavity<br>
is defined by arranging a plurality of slide dies,<br>
having a shape corresponding to a space between<br>
adjacent blades, radially relative to the hub shaft<br>
part.<br>
According to a still further embodiment of<br>
the manufacturing method of the invention, the cavity<br>
is defined by arranging a plurality of slide dies,<br>
which include a bottomed groove corresponding to a<br>
shape of a splitter blade and a configured body<br>
corresponding to a space defined by the pair of full<br>
blades adjacent to the splitter blade, radially<br>
relative to the hub shaft part.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
Since the compressor impeller according to<br>
the invention is one made of a magnesium alloy formed<br>
by the die-casting process, it is possible to obtain a<br>
compressor impeller, which is larger in specific<br>
strength than a conventional impeller made of an<br>
aluminum alloy. Also, since an impeller is made of a<br>
magnesium alloy, which is lower in cost than a titanium<br>
alloy, and has a die-casting process of high<br>
productivity, in which a molten metal is poured<br>
directly into a cavity of dies, applied thereto, it is<br>
possible to obtain an inexpensive compressor impeller.<br>
The invention can provide a compressor impeller capable<br>
of accommodating a further high-speed rotation than<br>
conventional, and a method of manufacturing the same,<br>
and becomes a very effective technique in industrial<br>
use.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]<br>
As described above, a key feature of the<br>
invention resides in that a compressor impeller made of<br>
a magnesium alloy being a die-cast product and<br>
comprising a hub shaft part, a hub disk part having a<br>
hub surface extending from the hub shaft part in a<br>
radial direction, and a plurality of blade parts<br>
provided on the hub surface is made a compressor<br>
impeller made of a magnesium alloy as die-cast.<br>
[0017]<br>
A magnesium alloy used in the invention<br>
generally has a density in the order of 1.8 g/cm3 and is<br>
small in density as compared with an aluminum alloy,<br>
which has a density in the order of 2.7 g/cm3, and other<br>
practical materials. Therefore, a compressor impeller<br>
made of a magnesium alloy is made lighter than an<br>
impeller made of an aluminum alloy, so that it is<br>
possible to decrease an inertia load in rotation.<br>
Also, it is possible to expect that the specific<br>
strength of a magnesium alloy is 1.3 times or more that<br>
of an aluminum alloy even in a temperature environment<br>
of 200°C. Accordingly, the compressor impeller,<br>
according to the invention, made of a magnesium alloy<br>
can accommodate a further high-speed rotation.<br>
Further, since a magnesium alloy exists in abundance as<br>
a mineral resource, stable supply is expected and<br>
supply can be effected at a lower cost than that of an<br>
impeller made of a titanium alloy.<br>
[0018]<br>
Also, since a magnesium alloy is markedly<br>
smaller in affinity with iron than an aluminum alloy,<br>
there is an advantage that even when, for example, a<br>
die made of an iron alloy is used a casting mold, a<br>
cast impeller can be smoothly released without seizure<br>
to the dies.<br>
[0019]<br>
The compressor impeller according to the<br>
invention comprises a compressor impeller as formed by<br>
die-casting. An impeller as formed by die-casting can<br>
form a compact, uniform solidification structure since<br>
its surface layer and a thin-walled portion are rapidly<br>
quenched. Specifically, a fine, compact, rapidly<br>
quenched structure having an average particle size of,<br>
for example, 15 ^im or less is formed on a blade part,<br>
which is thin-walled to have a small thermal capacity.<br>
Also, a hub disk part and a hub shaft part, which are<br>
massive to have a large thermal capacity, are formed<br>
on, for example, a surface layer thereof with a fine,<br>
compact, solidification structure, which has an average<br>
particle size of, for example, 15 (J.m or less, and<br>
formed in the vicinity of a core thereof with a<br>
solidification structure, which has an average particle<br>
size of 50 j^m or less and is larger than that of a<br>
surface layer. A coagulation rate is gradually<br>
decreased toward a core of an impeller from a surface<br>
side thereof, so that a solidification structure having<br>
a larger, average particle size than that of a rapidly<br>
uenched solidification structure is formed in the<br>
vicinity of a core of a hub disk part or a hub shaft<br>
part.<br>
The reason for this is that since a die are<br>
used as a casting mold in the die-casting process, it<br>
is markedly higher in cooling power than a refractory<br>
material, etc. used in the lost wax casting process,<br>
etc. and a molten metal in contact with a die is<br>
rapidly cooled on a thin-walled blade part, and surface<br>
layers of a disk part or a hub shaft part. Also, diecasting<br>
formation has an advantage that since a molten<br>
metal is poured into a cavity of dies at high pressure,<br>
the molten metal is improved in close contact property<br>
to a die surface whereby the molten metal is increased<br>
in cooling rate.<br>
[0020]<br>
By forming a casting structure of an impeller<br>
into the fine, compact, rapidly quenched structure<br>
described above, the impeller can be improved in<br>
surface hardness and fatigue strength to achieve an<br>
improvement in strength and toughness as an impeller.<br>
Also, by further subjecting an impeller with the<br>
solidification structure to heat treatment such as T6<br>
treatment (JIS-H0001) or the like, effects owing to<br>
solution treatment and aging effect are added while a<br>
matrix of a compact crystal structure is maintained, so<br>
that a further increase in strength is made possible.<br>
Also, since dies are used in the die-casting<br>
process, a casting surface of an impeller becomes<br>
smaller in surface roughness than in case of using a<br>
refractory material. Thereby, an impeller surface is<br>
decreased in aerodynamic resistance to enable<br>
contributing to an improvement of the aerodynamic<br>
performance of an impeller.<br>
[0021]<br>
Also, there are some cases, in which<br>
machining such as cutting, etc. is applied to an outer<br>
periphery of a hub shaft of an impeller, or an impeller<br>
itself is subjected to chemical conversion treatment,<br>
anodic oxidation treatment, surface treatment such as<br>
plating, coating, etc. Since a configured body of a<br>
magnesium alloy as formed by die-casting is made<br>
further fine and uniform in grain size, an improvement<br>
in machinability at room temperature and quality of<br>
film formation on a surface is achieved.<br>
Accordingly, the compressor impeller,<br>
according to the invention, as formed by die-casting,<br>
becomes an excellent compressor impeller, in which a<br>
blade part becomes high in strength, a hub disk part<br>
and a hub shaft part are high in strength as well as<br>
appropriate in toughness, and which possesses<br>
machinability at room temperature.<br>
[0022]<br>
Subsequently, a specific example of a<br>
configuration of a compressor impeller according to the<br>
invention is cited and described with reference to the<br>
drawings. Fig. 1 is a schematic view showing a<br>
compressor impeller 1 (referred below to as impeller 1)<br>
used on an intake side of an automobile turbocharger.<br>
The impeller 1 includes a hub shaft part 2, a hub disk<br>
part 4 having a hub surface 3 extending from the hub<br>
shaft part 2 in a radial direction, and a blade part,<br>
on which a plurality of full blades 5 and splitter<br>
blades 6, respectively, are alternately protrusively<br>
provided in a radial manner. Fig. 2 is a simplified<br>
view showing the blade part of the impeller 1 and<br>
illustrating only two full blades 5 and one splitter<br>
blade 6 for the sake of clarity. Also, a hatched area<br>
in Fig. 2 corresponds to a blade space 8 surrounded by<br>
the hub surface 3 and a blade surface 7 of two adjacent<br>
full blades 5 including a single splitter blade 6. The<br>
blade surfaces 7 of the full blade 5 and the splitter<br>
blade 6 include complex, aerodynamically curved<br>
surfaces on front and back sides.<br>
[0023]<br>
The compressor impeller according to the<br>
invention can be provided by replacing all the splitter<br>
blades 6 in the compressor impeller 1 described above<br>
by full blades 5. Also, the blades in the impeller can<br>
be made 8 to 14 in number. Also, the respective parts<br>
in the impeller can be formed to be sized such that the<br>
hub shaft part has an outside diameter of 7 to 30 mm,<br>
the hub disk part has an outside diameter of 30 to 120<br>
mm and a wall thickness of 2 to 5 mm on an outermost<br>
peripheral portion thereof, the blades have a wall<br>
thickness of 0.2 to 2 mm in the vicinity of blade tip<br>
ends, a wall thickness of 1 to 5 mm in the vicinity of<br>
blade centers, and a wall thickness of 1.5 to 8 mm on<br>
blade bases close to the hub surface. With such<br>
impeller, while the blade part is thin-walled, the hub<br>
shaft part and the hub disk part are formed into a mass<br>
and the entire blade part is formed to amount to 10 to<br>
30% in volume relative to the impeller. Also, a<br>
compressor impeller will do including an undercut<br>
provided radially outwardly of the hub shaft part in<br>
the blade space of the impeller.<br>
[0024]<br>
The compressor impeller according to the<br>
invention can be manufactured by, for example, the<br>
following manufacturing method according to the<br>
invention. Specifically, a compressor impeller can be<br>
manufactured by a die-casting process, in which a<br>
magnesium alloy heated to a liquidus temperature or<br>
higher is supplied into dies having a cavity<br>
corresponding to the shape of the compressor impeller,<br>
which includes a hub shaft part, a hub disk part having<br>
a hub surface extending from the hub shaft part in a<br>
radial direction, and a plurality of blade parts<br>
provided on the hub surface, for a filling time of not<br>
more than 1 second, a pressure of 20 MPa or higher is<br>
applied to the magnesium alloy in the cavity, and the<br>
pressurized state is maintained for a time of 1 sec. or<br>
longer.<br>
An important feature of the manufacturing<br>
method according to the invention resides in that a<br>
magnesium alloy is cast into a cavity of dies under the<br>
die-cast forming condition described above.<br>
[0025]<br>
The die-cast forming condition in the<br>
invention with the use of a magnesium alloy will be<br>
described below in detail.<br>
A magnesium alloy being poured into a cavity<br>
of dies has a molten metal temperature equal to or<br>
higher than a liquidus temperature of a magnesium alloy<br>
being used. This is because it is necessary to prevent<br>
a molten metal from solidifying before it reaches a<br>
cavity. Also, it does not matter how high a molten<br>
metal temperature is as far as a magnesium alloy<br>
component can be ensured and any inconvenience is not<br>
caused due to scattering of a molten metal, entrainment<br>
of gases, etc. at the time of casting.<br>
[0026]<br>
Also, a molten metal of a magnesium alloy is<br>
supplied into a cavity for a filling time of 1 sec. or<br>
shorter to cast a blade part of an impeller well. In<br>
order to get an excellent, aerodynamic performance, a<br>
blade part of a compressor impeller is normally<br>
designed to have a very thin wall thickness as compared<br>
with a hub disk part, which has a hub surface.<br>
Therefore, a blade part cavity of dies defined<br>
corresponding to the blade part makes a space in the<br>
form of a very narrow, deep groove. Hereupon, a molten<br>
metal is rapidly and adequately supplied into the blade<br>
part cavity of the dies by supplying a molten metal for<br>
the filling time described above. Thereby, a casting<br>
defect such as bad running of a molten metal,<br>
entrainment of gases in the blade part cavity, etc. is<br>
prevented. It does not matter how short a filling time<br>
of a molten metal is as far as any inconvenience is not<br>
caused due to scattering of a molten metal, entrainment<br>
of gases, etc. when casting.<br>
[0027]<br>
Subsequently, after a magnesium alloy is<br>
poured into a cavity of dies, a pressure of 20 MPa or<br>
higher is applied thereto, and the pressurized state is<br>
maintained for a time of 1 sec. or longer. Preferably,<br>
such operation is performed as rapid as possible after<br>
a molten metal is poured. Thereafter, the molten metal<br>
is solidified in the cavity to form an impeller. With<br>
the impeller, a blade part being thin-walled and small<br>
in heat capacity is first formed, and an outermost<br>
diameter portion and a hub surface of a hub disk part,<br>
which contacts directly with the dies, ends of a hub<br>
shaft part, etc. are formed. Solidification gradually<br>
progresses toward an interior of the hub disk part and<br>
a central portion thereof is finally solidified and<br>
formed. Therefore, a casting defect such as shrinkage<br>
cavity, etc. is liable to be generated around a center<br>
of the hub disk part, which makes a finally solidified<br>
portion. Hereupon, after a molten metal is poured, a<br>
pressure of 20 MPa or higher is applied thereto and the<br>
pressurized state is maintained for a time of 1 sec. or<br>
longer whereby an impeller is formed well. After the<br>
pressurized state is maintained for a time of not less<br>
than 1 sec., the pressure may be decreased but it is<br>
preferable to maintain the pressurized state until the<br>
molten metal is completely solidified and an impeller<br>
is formed surely.<br>
[0028]<br>
Subsequently, a cavity of dies in the<br>
manufacturing method according to the invention, in<br>
which the impeller 1 shown in Fig. 1 can be<br>
manufactured, will be described taking an example with<br>
reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of a die device.<br>
Dies include a moving die 21 capable of opening and<br>
closing in an axial direction 9 of an impeller, a<br>
stationary die 22, and slide dies 24 and slide supports<br>
24, which are capable of moving radially relative to<br>
the axial direction 9 of an impeller. Fig. 4 is a view<br>
as viewed along an arrow and showing an essential part<br>
of the stationary die 22, only respective ones of the<br>
slide die 23 and the slide support 24 being shown for<br>
the sake of clarity. Fig. 5 is a schematic view<br>
showing the slide die 23.<br>
[0029]<br>
The slide die 23 includes a bottomed groove<br>
portion in the form of a splitter blade and a<br>
configured body corresponding to a space defined by two<br>
full blades adjacent to a splitter blade. That is, the<br>
slide die 23 includes a hub cavity 31 corresponding to<br>
the hub surface 3 of the impeller 1, a blade cavity 32<br>
corresponding to the full blades 5, and a bottomed<br>
groove portion 33 (shown by dotted lines) corresponding<br>
to the splitter blade 6, so as to form a configuration<br>
corresponding to the blade space 8 shown in the hatched<br>
area in Fig. 2. Also, as shown in Fig. 4, a ringshaped<br>
support plate 25 is mounted on a bottom surface<br>
in an area, in which the slide dies 23 are radially<br>
movable relative to the axial direction 9, to support<br>
the slide dies 23. The support plate 25 is made<br>
movable in the axial direction 9 of a casting and<br>
constructed to be moved away from the slide dies 23<br>
after the moving die 21 and the stationary die 22 are<br>
opened, and to be returned to an original position when<br>
dieclosing the dies. That is, after the moving die 21<br>
and the stationary die 22 are opened, the slide dies 23<br>
are supported only on the slide supports 24.<br>
[0030]<br>
The slide dies 23, described above, the<br>
number of which corresponds to that of the blade spaces<br>
8 of the impeller 1, are arranged annularly on the<br>
stationary die 22 as shown in Fig. 3, and the<br>
respective slide dies 23, the moving die 21, and the<br>
stationary die 22 are closed to come into close contact<br>
with one another. Thereby, a cavity having<br>
substantially the same shape as that of the impeller 1<br>
can be formed in the dies. A molten metal of a<br>
magnesium alloy is poured into the cavity to form a<br>
casting 10.<br>
[0031]<br>
Subsequently, the slide dies 23 are moved<br>
radially outwardly in the axial direction 9 to be<br>
released from the casting 10. Specifically, after<br>
forming a casting 10, the moving die 21 is first moved<br>
away from the stationary die 22 to be opened, and then<br>
the support plate 25 is moved away from the slide dies<br>
23 to have the slide dies 23 supported only on the<br>
slide supports 24. As shown in Fig. 4, the slide<br>
supports 24 are taken out along grooves 26 provided on<br>
the stationary die 22 radially outwardly in the axial<br>
direction 9. At this time, the slide dies 23 are<br>
connected to rotating shafts 27 provided on the slide<br>
supports 24 whereby the slide dies 23 naturally rotate<br>
about the rotating shafts 27 to be released along<br>
surface shapes of full blades 5 and splitter blades 6<br>
of the casting 10 with a small resistance.<br>
[0032]<br>
After the dies release, unnecessary runner<br>
channel, sprue gate, flash, etc. may be removed from<br>
the casting 10 and the conversion treatment,<br>
anodization, surface treatment such as ceramic coating,<br>
plating, paint application, or the like may be further<br>
performed. Also, the hot isostatic pressing (HIP)<br>
treatment, sand blasting, chemical peeling, or the like<br>
may be performed. It is possible to obtain a<br>
compressor impeller of the invention with the<br>
manufacturing method described above.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the manufacturing method described above,<br>
when the cavity of the dies is maintained in the<br>
pressurized state after casting, it is also preferable<br>
to apply local pressurization in a location in the<br>
axial direction of the hub shaft part, in which<br>
coagulation and shrinkage are liable to occur, whereby<br>
a molten metal is partially supplied to enable<br>
preventing a casting defect such as shrinkage, etc.<br>
Also, the cavity of the dies, into which a<br>
molten metal of a magnesium alloy is poured, is<br>
preferably reduced to a pressure of 20 MPa or less.<br>
Since a molten metal is poured into a cavity at high<br>
speed in die-cast formation, gases such as air, gases,<br>
etc. are liable to be entrained according to a state of<br>
running of a molten metal in the cavity, and so a<br>
pressure in the cavity is beforehand reduced.<br>
Preferably, the pressure is reduced to 0.05 MPa or<br>
lower, more preferably, to 0.005 MPa or lower.<br>
Further, in the case where a magnesium alloy<br>
susceptible to oxidation is used, for example, it is<br>
preferable to beforehand fill inert gas such as argon,<br>
etc., mixed gases of argon and hydrogen, nitrogen, etc.<br>
into the cavity to cut off oxygen, thus preventing<br>
entrainment of an oxide into a casting.<br>
[0034]<br>
As specific examples of a preferred magnesium<br>
alloy used in the invention, for example, American<br>
Society for Testing and Materials' Standard (referred<br>
below to as ASTM) AZ91A to AZ91E are favorable in<br>
casting guality and mechanical property. Also, AS41A,<br>
AS41B, and AM50A are high in proof stress, elongation,<br>
etc. and AE42 has a high-temperature creep strength.<br>
Also, since WE43A has a higher, thermal resistance than<br>
those of all the alloys described above and WE41A and<br>
WE54A have more excellent, thermal resistance than the<br>
former, they are suited to a compressor impeller.<br>
While these magnesium alloys are a little higher in<br>
liquidus temperature than aluminum alloys, they are<br>
fairly lower in liquidus temperature than titanium<br>
alloys and so easy to regulate a molten metal<br>
temperature to a liquidus temperature or higher in case<br>
of die-cast formation. It is preferable to regulate a<br>
molten metal temperature to higher temperatures by 10<br>
to 80°C than a liquidus temperature to surely prevent<br>
coagulation of a molten metal midway in molten metal<br>
flow passages of a die device and a casting device.<br>
[0035]<br>
Also, while a molten metal of a magnesium<br>
alloy may be manufactured by any method as far as being<br>
suited to a magnesium alloy as used, it suffices to<br>
perform melting with the use of, for example, a gas<br>
direct heating furnace, an electric type indirect<br>
heating furnace, a melting crucible and a melting<br>
cylinder, which are provided in a die-casting machine.<br>
Also, while a molten metal of a magnesium alloy can be<br>
treated in the atmosphere, a magnesium alloy, which<br>
contains, for example, a rare earth element, etc. to be<br>
susceptible to oxidation, is preferably treated in an<br>
atmosphere, in which inert gas such as argon, etc., Na<br>
gas, CO gas, COa gas, etc. are used to cut off oxygen.<br>
[0036]<br>
As described above, with the manufacturing<br>
method of the invention described as an example, it is<br>
possible to define a cavity of dies corresponding to a<br>
shape of a compressor impeller having a complex shape,<br>
in which a plurality of blade parts comprise<br>
alternately adjacent full blades and splitter blades,<br>
and it is possible to obtain a compressor impeller of<br>
the invention, which has a dense cast structure being<br>
favorable in form accuracy, is excellent in specific<br>
strength, and can be conformed to a further high speed<br>
rotation provided that the impeller can be released<br>
from dies after casting. Since any particular<br>
machining and any form regulation after casting are not<br>
applied and any sacrificial pattern copying an impeller<br>
is not formed, a marked improvement is achieved in<br>
terms of production efficiency and manufacturing cost,<br>
thus enabling providing a compressor impeller being<br>
more inexpensive than conventional ones.<br>
EMBODIMENT<br>
[0037]<br>
An impeller having a shape shown in Fig. 1<br>
was manufactured as an example of the compressor<br>
impeller of the invention by the manufacturing method<br>
of the invention described above. Specifically, ASTM<br>
Standard AZ91D having a liguidus temperature of 595°C<br>
was selected as a magnesium alloy and melted to prepare<br>
a molten metal. The molten metal was supplied to a<br>
die-casting machine, on which a casting device shown in<br>
Fig. 3 was arranged, and poured into that cavity of<br>
dies, which was defined by the plurality of slide dies<br>
23 shown in Fig. 5, and then the molten metal was<br>
maintained in the pressurized state to provide a<br>
casting. At this time, an interior of the cavity<br>
before pouring of a molten metal was put in the ambient<br>
air atmosphere. Also, the molten metal was regulated<br>
to be poured into the cavity at a molten metal<br>
temperature of 640°C for a filling time of 0.02 sec.<br>
After the molten metal was filled, it was pressurized<br>
and maintained at a pressure of 40 MPa for a time of 2<br>
sec., and then adequately cooled until the molten metal<br>
was solidified.<br>
[0038]<br>
Subsequently, after the moving die 21 shown<br>
in Fig. 3 was separated from the stationary die 22, the<br>
slide dies 23 shown in Fig. £ were released from a<br>
casting 10 in a procedure shown in Fig. ^ to provide a<br>
casting 10 by die-casting. Fig. v is a side view<br>
showing a construction, in which the slide dies 23 and<br>
the slide supports 24 were joined, the slide dies 23<br>
being connected to the slide support 24 with a<br>
stationary pin 29 inserted into the rotating shaft 27<br>
through a bearing 28. Also, a guide pin 30 was<br>
provided on a bottom of the slide support 24 to serve<br>
as a guide, by which the slide support 24 was taken out<br>
along the groove 26 provided on the stationary die 22<br>
radially outwardly in the axial direction 9. Fig. 7 is<br>
a schematic view showing a specific motion procedure,<br>
in which the slide die 23 was released from a casting<br>
10 while being moved radially outward in the axial<br>
direction 9 to be rotated, Figs. 7(a) to 7(d) showing a<br>
state, in which the slide die 23 was being released<br>
from the casting 10. In addition, a cavity portion of<br>
the slide die 23 in Fig. 7 is hatched as a matter of<br>
convenience for explanation of a release operation.<br>
When the slide support 24 was moved in order to release<br>
the casting 10, the slide die 23 was naturally rotated<br>
about the rotating shaft 27 while being moved along<br>
surface shapes of full blades 5 and a splitter blade 6<br>
of the casting 10, and finally released from the<br>
casting 10 as shown in Fig. 7(d).<br>
[0039]<br>
Unnecessary runner channel, sprue gate,<br>
flash, etc. were removed from the casting 10, and a<br>
compressor impeller of the invention was obtained<br>
having a shape including full blades and splitter<br>
blades, having an outside diameter of 13 mm for a hub<br>
shaft part, an outside diameter of 69 mm for a hub disk<br>
part, a wall thickness of 2.5 mm on an outermost<br>
diameter portion, a blade wall thickness of 0.5 mm in<br>
the vicinity of a blade tip end, 1.2 mm in the vicinity<br>
of a blade center, and 2.2 mm at a blade bases close to<br>
the hub surface, and 13% by volume for all blades<br>
relative to an impeller. As a result of carrying out<br>
tension tests by the use of gathering test pieces from<br>
within the hub disk part of the casting impeller on the<br>
basis of JIS-Z2241, thereon the specific strength was<br>
127 MPa at 20°C and 70 MPa at 200°C.<br>
[0040]<br>
Figs. 8 to 10 show examples of a cast<br>
structure of an impeller for the compressor impeller as<br>
manufactured in the manner described above. Fig. 8<br>
shows a section of a full blade substantially<br>
perpendicular to an axial direction of a hub shaft part<br>
and presents a cast structure in the vicinity being<br>
distant 4 mm from a blade tip end and having a wall<br>
thickness of 1.15 mm. Fig. 9 shows a surface layer of<br>
a hub surface of a section of a hub disk part and<br>
presents a cast structure in the vicinity being<br>
inwardly distant 10mm from an outermost diameter<br>
portion of the hub disk part and having a depth of 1<br>
mm. Fig. 10 shows a cast structure in the vicinity of<br>
a central portion of an impeller, at which a plane<br>
defining an outermost diameter portion of a hub disk<br>
part intersects an axial direction of a hub shaft part.<br>
A homogeneous, dense, rapidly quenched, cast structure<br>
composed of fine crystal grains having a grain size of<br>
5 to 10 (im was confirmed on surface layers of a blade<br>
part and a hub surface. In particular, fine crystal<br>
grains having a grain size of 5 jam or less were much<br>
formed on a thin-walled blade part. Also, a cast<br>
structure mainly composed of crystal grains having a<br>
little larger grain size of 20 ^m than those on a<br>
surface layer was confirmed on a central portion of an<br>
impeller.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0041]<br>

used on an intake side of a supercharger assembled into<br>
internal combustion engines of automobiles, ships and<br>
vessels, etc.<br>
