"POWER SAVE BY DIRECT LINK"<br>
Qualcoinm Incorporated, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware, USA, of Attn: International IP Administration, 5775 Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1714 USA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
I<br>
DIRECT LINK SET-UP POWER SAVE DELIVERY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application<br>
Serial No. 60/987,007 entitled "DIRECT LINK SET-UP (DLS) POWER SAVE METHOD AND APPARATUS" which was filed November 9, 2007. The entirety of the aforementioned application is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002]	The following description relates generally to wireless communications,<br>
and more particularly to employing power save delivery mechanisms with direct link set-up connections.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various<br>
types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems can be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, ...). Examples of such multiple-access systems can include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. Additionally, the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project (3GPP), 3GPP2, 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE), etc,<br>
[0004]	Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can<br>
simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations can be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input<br>
 <br>
multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. In addition, mobile devices can communicate with other mobile devices (and/or base stations with other base stations) in peer-to-peer wireless network configurations.<br>
[0005]	Wireless communication systems can employ one or more base stations<br>
or access points that provide a coverage area. A typical base station can transmit multiple data streams for broadcast, multicast and/or unicast services, wherein a data stream can be a stream of data that can be of independent reception interest to an access terminal. An access terminal within the coverage area of such base station can be employed to receive one, more than one, or all the data streams carried by the composite stream. Likewise, an access terminal can transmit data to the base station or another access terminal.<br>
[0006]	In addition, wireless communication system can include network such as<br>
wireless wide area networks (WWANs) that provide communication coverage for large geographic areas (e.g., cities), wireless local area networks (WLANs) that provide communication coverage for medium-size geographic areas (e.g., buildings and campuses), and wireless personal area networks (WPANs) that provide communication coverage for small geographic areas (e.g., homes). A wireless network typically includes one or more access points (or base stations) that support communication for one or more user terminals (or wireless devices).<br>
[0007]	IEEE 802.11 is a family of standards developed by The Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for WLANs. These standards specify an over-the-air interface between an access point and a user terminal or between two user terminals. IEEE Std 802.11, 1999 Edition (or simply, "802.11"), which is entitled "Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications," supports data rates of 1 and 2 mega bits/second (Mbps) in the 2.4 giga Hertz (GHz) frequency band using either frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) or direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). IEEE Std 802.11 a-1999 (or simply, "802.1 la") is a supplement to 802.13, uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) instead of FHSS or DSSS, and supports data rates of up to 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz frequency band. IEEE Std 802.1 lb-1999 (or simply, "802.1 lb") is another supplement to 802.11 and uses DSSS to support data rates of up to 11 Mbps. IEEE Std 802.11 g-2003 (or simply, "802.11 g") is yet another supplement to 802.11, uses DSSS<br>
 <br>
and OFDM, and supports data rates of up to 54 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band. These<br>
various standards are well known in the art and publicly available.<br>
[0008]	The lowest data rate supported by 802.11, 802.11 a, 802.11 b and 802.11 g<br>
is 1 Mbps. For 802.1 lb and 802.1 Ig (or simply, "802.1 Ib/g"), a specific DSSS scheme and a specific modulation scheme are used to send a transmission at the lowest data rate of I Mbps. The DSSS and modulation schemes for 1 Mbps require a certain minimum signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SNR) for reliable reception of the transmission. The range of the transmission is then determined by the geographic area within which a receiving station can achieve the required SNR or better.<br>

UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP). CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2).<br>
[0048]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a wireless communications system 100 is<br>
illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. The system 100 can include a basic service set (BSS) that includes at least one access point 102 that serves one or more mobile stations such as mobile station 104 and mobile station 106. While Fig. 1 depicts only two mobile stations (e.g., mobile stations 104 and 106), it is to be appreciated that any number of mobile stations can be employed in connection with wireless communications system 100. Moveovev, it is to be appreciated that system 100 can include additional access points beyond the depicted access point 102. In one aspect, access point 102 can be, for example, a wireless router that is equipped with a<br>
 <br>
transceiver that transmits and receives data in accordance with and compliant with a communication standard, such as IEEE 802.11.<br>
[0049]	Access point 102 can additionally include transmitter chains and receiver<br>
chains, each of which can in turn comprises a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. Access point 102 can communicate with mobile stations 104 and 106; however, it is to be appreciated that access point 102 can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile stations 104 and 106. The mobile stations 104 and 106 can also be referred to as user terminals, mobile terminals, stations or STAs herein. Pursuant to an illustrative embodiment, access point 102 and mobile stations 304 and 1Q6 can communicate via a wireless local area network (WLAN). According to one or more aspects, the WLAN can be a high speed multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) OFDM system; however, the WLAN can be any wireless system. Access point 102 can communicate with a plurality of external devices or processes via network 108. Network 108 can be the Internet, an intranet, or any other wired, wireless, or optical network. A connection can carry signals from the network 108 to the access point 102 and vice versa. Devices or processes can be communicatively coupled to network 108 or, as with mobile stations 104 and 106, on the WLAN. Examples of devices that can be connected to either network 108 ov WLAN include cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, media devices such as HDTV, DVD player, wireless speakers, cameras, camcorders, webcams, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system 100. Processes can include voice, video, data communications, etc. Various data streams can have varying transmission requirements, which can be accommodated by using varying Quality of Service (QoS) techniques.<br>
[0050]	System 100 can be deployed with the centralized access point 102.<br>
Pursuant to an illustration, mobile stations, such as mobile stations 104 and 106 can communicate with the access point 102. In addition, the mobile stations 102 and 104<br>
 <br>
can communicate via direct peer-to-peer communication (e.g., employing direct link set¬up (DLS)<br>
[0051]	In accordance with an aspect, a direct link set-up (DLS) power save<br>
delivery (DPSD) mechanism can be employed with system 100. The mobile stations 104 and 106 can communicate with the access point 102 through a communications channel, such as wireless links 110 and 112, respectively. The mobile stations 104 and 106 can be, for example, a cell phone, a laptop computer, a mobile consumer electronic device, a smart phone, pocket PC or other wireless communications apparatus, that is equipped with a transceiver that transmits and receives data in accordance with and compliant with a communication standard, such as IEEE 802.11. Moreover, mobile stations can communicate directly with other stations through a communication channel, such as wireless link 114 between mobile station 104 and mobile station 106. The direct communication can employ a DLS mechanism that enables mobile stations to communicate with each other without routing data through access point 102. DLS mechanisms enable direct data transfer between non-access point QoS stations in a basic service set. DLS can improve traffic efficiency by increasing throughput and decreasing delay. It is noted that frames need not be routed through the access point 102. DLS includes link set-up before a data session begins and also link tear-down after a data session is completed.<br>
[0052]	Mobile stations 104 and 3 06 can employ a beacon power save mode that<br>
facilitates conserving power during periods of inactivity. Typically, only access point 102 is aware of sleep states of mobile stations 104 and 106. For instance, the access point is aware of which mobile stations are awake and which are asleep. DLS can be difficult to maintain as mobile stations are not typically aware of sleep states of peers. However, as described infra, the mobile station 104 and 106 can employ DLS power save delivery mechanisms to maintain DLS data transfers while conserving power through Beacon power save. For instance, in one aspect, both mobile stations 104 and 106 can negotiate a scheduled time at which both stations can awaken to transfer data. According to another aspect, one mobile station can remain awake while another sleeps. The sleeping mobile station can transmit a trigger frame to the always awake mobile station upon waking to enable data transfer there between.<br>
 <br>
[0053]	Example embodiments are disclosed herein that support employing DLS<br>
power save delivery to effectuate coalescence of DLS techniques and beacon power save operation.   Various example embodiments preserve the simplicity and robustness of legacy WLAN systems, examples of which are found in 802.11 (a-z). The advantages of the various embodiments may be achieved while maintaining backward compatibility with such legacy systems. In the description below, 802.11 systems are described as example legacy systems. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the improvements are also compatible with alternate systems and standards. In addition, it is to be appreciated that aspects described herein can be implemented in other wireless communications system other than 802.11 systems to enable direct communication and power save modes in a centralized wireless system.<br>
[0054]	Turning to Fig. 2, illustrated is a communications apparatus 200 for<br>
employment within a wireless communications environment. For instance, communications apparatus 200 can be a mobile station or portion thereof such as mobile stations 104 and 106 described with reference to Fig. 1. The communications apparatus 200 can include a direct link set-up (DLS) module 202 that facilitates establishment of direct links between communications apparatus and any other non-access point communications apparatus (not shown). Direct links enable data to be directly communicated from one apparatus to another apparatus without having to be routed through a centralized access point. The DLS module 202 can set-up or establish a direct link before a data session commences. In addition, the DLS module 202 can maintain the direct link during the data session and, further, tear-down or destroy the direct link upon completion of the data session. Pursuant to an illustration, the DLS module 202 can establish a direct link with a peer via negotiation through an access point (not shown).<br>
[0055]	The communications apparatus 200 can further include a traffic<br>
specification negotiator 204 that facilitates negotiating and generating traffic specifications (TPSECs). A traffic specification or TPSEC describes traffic characteristics and quality of service (QoS) requirements of a traffic or data stream. In addition, the TPSEC can also be employed to reserve resources (e.g., transmission opportunities) with a hybrid coordinator according to a hybrid coordination function (HCF) controlled channel access (HCCA) mechanism. Further, the TPSEC can specify<br>
 <br>
additional parameters associated with a traffic stream such as, but not limited to, a<br>
traffic classifier and/or acknowledgement policy. After successful negotiation of the<br>
TPSEC, a traffic stream can be created in accordance therewith.<br>
[0056]	In a centralized scheme, communications apparatus 200 transmits data to<br>
an access point (not shown). Since traffic from communications apparatus 200, other<br>
apparatuses and/or "mobile stations is facilitated by an access point, a power save mode<br>
is available. The communications apparatus 200 can enter into a power save mode (e.g.,<br>
enter into a sleep mode) and conserve power (e.g., battery power) during periods of<br>
inactivity. In the centralized scheme, an access point can buffer frames or transmissions<br>
intended for communications apparatus 200. Periodically, based at least in part on a<br>
beacon interval, the access point can notify the communications apparatus 200 that data<br>
is waiting to be sent on a downlink stream. The access point is aware of times when the<br>
communications apparatus 200 transitions out of a power save mode (e.g., wakes from<br>
sleep), and thus can appropriately synchronize such notifications.<br>
[0057]	Pursuant to an aspect, the communications apparatus 200 can include a<br>
power management module 206 that facilitates power management and/or conservation. The power management module 206 can configure a power management mode of the communications apparatus 200. For instance, the power management module 206 can change the power management state or mode of the communications apparatus 200 from an awake or active mode to a sleep or power save mode. In addition, the power management mode 206 can transition the communications apparatus 200 from a sleep mode to an active mode. The power management module 206 can notify an access point of a change in power management mode. While the communications apparatus 200 is in a power save mode, the access point does not arbitrarily transmit data to the communications apparatus 200. Rather, the access point can transmit at designated times. In addition, the communications apparatus 200 in a power save mode listens for beacons generated by an access point. For instance, the power management module 206 can awaken the communications apparatus 200 temporarily to enable the apparatus 200 to listen for the beacons. The communications apparatus 200 can determine if the access point retains buffered data by receiving and analyzing a traffic indicator map that, in part, identifies mobile stations associated with buffered data waiting for transmission.<br>
 <br>
[0058]	Direct links can be established with DLS. Typically, a mobile station,<br>
such as communications apparatus 200, is prohibited from entering power save mode<br>
while active DLS links persist. For instance, in power save mode, an access point is<br>
aware that a mobile station is sleeping but DLS peers are not. The communications<br>
apparatus 200 includes a DLS power save delivery (DPSD) module 208 that facilitates<br>
direct data transfers between the communications apparatus 200 and other mobile<br>
station peers while enabling employment of power save mode. In accordance with one<br>
aspect, the DLS power save delivery module 208 can effectuate a schedule that enables<br>
the communications apparatus 200 and DLS peers to coordinate a wake-up time.<br>
Pursuant to an example, the traffic specification negotiation 204 can include additional<br>
parameters in a traffic specification that indicate the coordinated wake-up time. Upon<br>
waking up, the communications apparatus 200 and DLS peers can transfer data, either<br>
unidirectionally or bidirectionally, before returning to a power save or sleep mode. In<br>
addition, pursuant to another illustration, an unscheduled delivery approach can be<br>
utilized. In an unscheduled delivery approach, one peer can remain awake while<br>
another sleeps. For example, one peer can include active data transfers with another<br>
DLS peer or an access point while the other peer is inactive. When a sleeping peer<br>
awakens, a trigger'frame is sent to notify others. An always-awake peer can transmit<br>
buffered data to the waking peer upon receipt of the trigger frame.<br>
[0059]	Now referring to Fig. 3, illustrated is a wireless communications system<br>
300 that can facilitate conserving power while maintaining DLS connections. The system 300 includes an access point 302 that can communicate with a mobile station 304, a mobile station 306, and/or any number of disparate devices (not shown). The access point 302 can transmit information to the mobile station 304 and the mobile station 306 over forward link or downlink channels; further access point 302 can receive information from the mobile station 304 and/or the mobile station 306 over reverse link or uplink channels. Moreover, system 300 can be a M1MO system. Additionally, the system 300 can operate in an OFDMA wireless network (such as 3GPP, 3GPP2, 3GPP LTE, etc., for example) and/or an 802.11 wireless network.<br>
[0060]	The mobile station 304 can include a direct link set-up (DLS) module<br>
308 that facilitates creation, maintenance and destruction of direct links via DLS between mobile station 304 and any other mobile station, such as, but not limited to<br>
 <br>
mobile station 306. In addition, the mobile station 304 can include a traffic specification (TPSEC) negotiator 310 that facilitates negotiating and generating traffic specifications (TPSECs) for traffic or data streams between mobile station 304 and access point 302, between mobile station 304 and mobile station 306, and/or between mobile station 304 and any other wireless communication devices (not shown). Moreover, the mobile station 304 can include a power management module 312 that facilitates power management for the mobile station 304 (e.g., switch power management modes between active and power save). The mobile station 304 can further include a DLS power save delivery (DPSD) module 314 that enables power save modes to be utilized while data transfers or sessions via DLS are active. It is to be appreciated that that the DLS module 308, the TPSEC negotiator 310, power management module 312 and DPSD module 314 can be substantially similar to direct link set-up module 202, traffic specification negotiator 204, power management module 206, and DLS power save delivery module 208 as described with reference to Fig. 2. Further, mobile station 306 can include a direct link set-up (DLS) module 316, traffic specification (TPSEC) negotiator 318, power management module 320, and DLS power save delivery (DPSD) module 322 that are substantially similar to corresponding modules included in mobile station 304.<br>
[0061]	Pursuant to an illustration, mobile station 304 can retain data or frames<br>
that the mobile station 304 intends to transfer directly with mobile station 306. Direct data transfers can improve throughput and alleviate latency by obviating the requirement to route data through the access point 302. DLS module 308 of mobile station 304 can initiate direct link set-up protocol that is coordinated by the access point 302. The DLS module 308 can transmit a DLS Request to the access point 302. In an aspect, the DLS Request can include information such as, but not limited to, a rate set, capabilities of mobile station 304 and addresses (e.g., MAC addresses) of mobile stations 304 and 306. The access point 302 can forward the DLS Request to mobile station 306 to be managed by the DLS module 316 of mobile station 306. If the mobile station 306 accepts the direct stream, the DLS module 316 can transmit a DLS Response to the access point 302. The DLS Response can include information such as, but not limited to, a rate set, capabilities of mobile station 306, and addresses of mobile stations 304 and 306. The access point 302 can forward the DLS Response to mobile<br>
 <br>
station 304 after which a direct link becomes active. DLS modules 308 and 316 can facilitate direct transmission of data frames via the direct link between mobile stations 304 and 306.<br>
[0062]	Typically, power management module 312 of mobile station 304 and<br>
power management module 320 of mobile station 306 can be prohibited from transitioning into a power save mode while active direct links persist. Power management modules 312 and 320 notify the access point 302 of power management states of mobile stations 304 and 306, respectively. However, mobile stations 304 and 306 remain unaware of such states associated with their respective direct link peers. DPSD modules 314 and 322 provide mechanisms to enable mobile stations 304 and 306, respectively, to maintain active direct links without prohibiting power management. Pursuant to an illustrative embodiment, DPSD modules 314 and 322 can employ scheduled delivery mechanisms and/or unscheduled delivery mechanisms. DPSD module 314.of mobile station 304 includes a scheduled DPSD module 324 that manages scheduled power save delivery and an unscheduled DPSD module 328 that manages unscheduled power save delivery. Similarly, DPSD module 322 of mobile station 306 includes a scheduled DPSD module 326 and an unscheduled DPSD module 330.<br>
[0063]	In a scheduled delivery mechanism, both mobile station 304 and mobile<br>
station 306 can enter a power save mode. In contrast, under an unscheduled delivery<br>
mechanism, one of mobile station 304 or 306 remains in an active mode while the other<br>
enters a power save mode. During establishment of a direct link, mobile stations 304<br>
and 306 can determine whether to utilize a scheduled delivery mechanism, an<br>
unscheduled delivery mechanism or a combination thereof. For instance, if mobile<br>
station 304 engages in additional data traffic other than the direct link, an unscheduled<br>
mechanism can be employed to enable mobile station 306 to enter power save while<br>
mobile station 304 remains active to tend to other traffic. In addition, if both mobile<br>
stations 304 and 306 only maintain data traffic there between, a scheduled mechanism<br>
can be employed to enable both stations to enter power save.<br>
[0064]	Pursuant to an aspect, mobile stations 304 and 306 can maintain active<br>
direct links while also entering power save modes by sharing wake-up times or notifying each other upon waking. TPSEC negotiator 310 of mobile station 304 and<br>
 <br>
TPSEC negotiator 318 of mobile station 306 can employ TPSEC negotiation to determine and/or setup scheduled or unscheduled wake-up times. In scheduled DPSD, the scheduled DPSD modules 324 and 326 are configured with a shared or scheduled wake up time. During TPSEC negotiation, an offset parameter and a service interval parameter can be established.<br>
[0065]	Turning briefly to Fig. 4, illustrated is an example timing diagram 400<br>
that depicts scheduled power save delivery according to an aspect of the subject disclosure. Pursuant to an illustration, mobile station 304 and mobile station 306 from Fig. 3 can interoperate in a manner consistent with timing diagram 400 in accordance with scheduled DPSD as provided by scheduled DPSD modules 324 and 326. Scheduled DPSD can be utilized with applications that employ QoS flows and/or best efforts flows. For'example, scheduled DPSD can be utilized for VoIP data. As discussed supra, mobile stations can negotiate a shared wake-up time. The shared wake-up time can be established with reference to a particular time. For instance, the reference can be a target beacon transmission time (TBTT) which is a time at which an access point transmits a beacon utilized in power management.<br>
[0066]	As discussed supra, an offset parameter and a service interval parameter<br>
can be established during TPSEC negotiation to specify a shared time at which two mobile stations can wake up to transfer data. The offset parameter can indicate a time between the TBTT and a first data transfer interval. The service interval parameter can indicate a time between starting points of two consecutive data transfer windows. Accordingly, the offset parameter and the service interval parameter established the data transfer intervals or windows at which time mobile stations can wake up and transfer data over a direct link.<br>
[0067]	During a data transfer window, unidirectional or bidirectional data<br>
transfer can occur :as depicted in diagram 400. At the beginning of a data transfer window, both mobile stations (e.g., STA1 and STA2) can enter an active mode (e.g., wake up) and perform enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA). EDCA is a contention based access mechanism that supports QoS flows. After EDCA, a mobile station (e.g., STA1) can transmit data (e.g., a frame). In addition, STA1 can employ a MoreData indicator that can notify a recipient (e.g., STA2) that additional buffered data exists. Upon successful receipt of the data frame, STA2 can transmit an<br>
 <br>
acknowledgement (ACK). If STA1 has no more data, it can transmit an end of service period (EOSP) indicator that notifies STA2 that it is ready to return to a power save mode. As depicted in diagram 400, STA2 can perform substantially similar operations as STA]. When STA] andSTAl both transmit and receive an EOSP indicator, the mobile stations return to a power save or sleep mode.<br>
[0068]	While diagram 400 depicts bidirectional data transfer, it is to be<br>
appreciated that unidirectional transfer can also be scheduled. At the agreed time, both stations wake-up. The transmitting station transmits frames as described supra. After transmission of data, the transmitting station sends an EOSP indication. Upon receiving an acknowledgment of the EOSP, the transmitting station enters a power save mode. If no acknowledgment is received, the transmitting station retransmits the EOSP indication and enters the power save mode. In addition, while the mobile stations are illustrated as transmitting data in turn, it is to be appreciated that the mobile stations can transmit simultaneously within the data transfer window.<br>
[0069]	Referring back to Fig. 3, mobile stations 304 and 306 can employ an<br>
unscheduled power save delivery mechanism in accordance with another aspect of the subject disclosure. In unscheduled DPSD, the unscheduled DPSD modules 328 and 330 are configured to notify a DLS peer upon waking and/or to transmit buffered data in response to a wake notification. For example, mobile station 304 can remain active while mobile station 306 enters a power save mode. The mobile station 306 can wake-up (e.g., enter an active mode) and transmit a notification to the mobile station 304. Upon receiving the notification, the mobile station 304 can transmit buffered data to mobile station 306.<br>
[0070]	Turning now to Fig. 5, illustrated is an example timing diagram 500 that<br>
depicts unscheduled power save delivery according to an aspect of the subject<br>
disclosure. Pursuant to an illustration, mobile station 304 and mobile station 306 from<br>
Fig. 3 can interoperate in a manner consistent with timing diagram 500 in accordance<br>
with unscheduled DPSD as provided by unscheduled DPSD modules 328 and 330.<br>
During unscheduled DPSD, one station (e.g., an always awake STA) remains in an<br>
active mode while a peer station (e.g., STA 1) is in a power save mode.<br>
[0071]	During a data transfer window, unidirectional transfer can occur as<br>
depicted in diagram 500. At the beginning of a data transfer window, STA1 can<br>
 <br>
transition from a power save mode into active mode. STA1 performs EDCA access and transmits a trigger frame. The always awake STA can transmit an acknowledgment (ACK) in response to the trigger frame and commence transmitting buffered data to STA I after performing EDCA access. Pursuant to an illustration, the buffered data can be data frames assigned to be delivery-enabled and can be limited by a configured maximum DLS service period parameter. It is to be appreciated that individual data frames can be transmitted in connection with a MoreData indicator as described supra with reference to Fig, 4. In addition, the always awake STA can employ an EOSP indication upon transmission of a last data frame. The EOSP indication can notify STAi that it can return to a power save mode.<br>
[0072]	While diagram 400 depicts unidirectional data transfer, it is to be<br>
appreciated that bidirectional transfer can also be employed with unscheduled DPSD.<br>
For example, whenever a mobile station retains buffered data to transfer to a DLS peer<br>
station, it can transition out of power save mode into active mode and send a trigger<br>
frame. Upon receiving an acknowledgment, the mobile station can transmit data in a<br>
manner similar to that employed by the always awake station.<br>
[0073]	Referring to Figs. 6-9, methodologies relating to maintaining active<br>
direct links during power save modes are described. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.<br>
[0074]	Turning to Fig. 6, illustrated is a method 600 that facilitates employing a<br>
DLS power save delivery mechanism to transmit data in a wireless communications system. The method 600 can be implemented by a mobile station (e.g., mobile device, access terminal, user terminal, user equipment, etc.) to enable power management in connection with active direct links (e.g., DLS links), for example. The method 600 can commence at reference numeral 602 where an access operation is performed after<br>
 <br>
waking up, at a scheduled time, from a sleep or power save state. Pursuant to an<br>
illustration, the scheduled time can be negotiated and specified in a traffic specification<br>
wherein the negotiation occurs between at least two mobile stations intent on<br>
establishing a direct data transfer link. In one aspect, the scheduled time can be an<br>
offset from a reference time such as a target beacon transmission time (TBTT).<br>
[0075]	At reference numeral 604, a data frame and an indicator can be<br>
transmitted to a DLS peer (e.g., another mobile station privy to the direct link). The<br>
indicator can specify existence or non-existence of additional data. At reference<br>
numeral 606, an acknowledgment corresponding to the transmitted data frame can be<br>
received from the DLS peer. At reference numeral 608, a determination is made as to<br>
whether additional data frames are buffered. For instance, if the transmitted indicator<br>
specified additional data was present, then the additional data can be determined to be<br>
buffered and the method 600 returns to reference numeral 604 to transmit at least one<br>
additional data frame and another indicator. If no additional data is buffered, the<br>
method 600 proceeds to reference numeral 610 where an end of service period (EOSP)<br>
indicator is transmitted. The EOSP indicator notifies the DLS peer that no additional<br>
data is buffered and that the transmitting station is ready to enter a power save mode.<br>
At reference numeral 63 2, data frames, if any, are received from at least one peer. It is<br>
to be appreciated that reference numeral 612 can occur simultaneously and/or<br>
concurrently with reference numerals 602-610. At reference numeral 614, a power save<br>
or sieep mode is entered upon receipt of an EOSP indicator from a DLS peer.<br>
[0076]	Referring to Fig. 7, illustrated is a methodology 700 that facilitates<br>
receiving data transmission in accordance with a DLS power save delivery mechanism. The method 700 can be implemented by a mobile station (e.g., mobile device, access terminal, user terminal, user equipment, etc.) to enable power management states in connection with active direct links (e.g., DLS links), for example. The method 700 can commence at reference numeral 702 where an active state is entered from a sleep state at a scheduled time. The scheduled time can be negotiated and specified in a traffic specification wherein the negotiation occurs between at least two mobile stations intent on establishing a direct data transfer link. For instance, the scheduled time can be an offset from a reference time such as a target beacon transmission time (TBTT).<br>
 <br>
[0077]	At reference numeral 704, a data frame and an indicator is received<br>
wherein the indicator informs of additional frame data (or informs no additional data<br>
exists). At reference numeral 706, an acknowledgment is transmitted in response to the<br>
received data frame. At reference numeral 708, a determination is made as to whether<br>
additional buffered data is waiting for transmission. For instance, the indicator received<br>
at reference numeral 704 can indicate additional buffered data is available. In addition,<br>
the indicator can specify that no additional buffered data is available. If additional<br>
buffered data is waiting, the method 700 returns to reference numeral 704 where an<br>
additional data frame and indicator is received. The method 700 can continue to loop<br>
until and indication of no additional data is received. If no more data is waiting, the<br>
method 700 proceeds to reference numeral 710 where an end of service period (EOSP)<br>
indication is received. At reference numeral 712, any buffered data frames for a DLS<br>
peer can be transmitted. For example, the data can be transmitted in accordance with<br>
method 600 described with reference to Fig. 6. In addition, it is to be appreciated that<br>
reference numeral 7)2 can occur simultaneously and/or concurrently with reference<br>
numerals 702-710. At reference numeral 714, an EOSP indication is transmitted to the<br>
DLS peer. At reference numeral 716, a power save or sleep mode is entered.<br>
[0078]	Fig, 8 illustrates a method 800 that facilitates receiving data<br>
transmissions according to an unscheduled DLS power save delivery mechanism. The method 800 can be implemented by a mobile station that enters a power save mode while maintaining an active direct link with an always awake station. The method 800 can commence at reference numeral 802 where the mobile station wakes from a sleep state (e.g., power save mode) and performs an access operation. At reference numeral 804, a trigger frame is transmitted to an always awake mobile station. At reference numeral 806, delivery enabled unicast data is received. At reference numeral 808, the mobile station returns to a sleep state or power save mode.<br>
[0079]	Fig. 9 depicts a method 900 that facilitates employing an unscheduled<br>
DLS power save delivery mechanism to transmit data. The method 900 can be employed by an always awake mobile station that retains buffered data frames for a peer mobile station in a power save mode. The method 900 can commence at reference numeral 902 where a trigger frame is received from a peer mobile station transitioning from a power save-state. At reference numeral 904, an acknowledgment is transmitted<br>
 <br>
in response to the trigger frame. At reference numeral 906, delivery enabled data is transmitted to the peer mobile station. At reference numeral 908, the transmission of the delivery enabled data is completed based upon at least one of an end of buffer or a maximum service period length.<br>
[0080]	It will be appreciated that, in accordance with one or more aspects<br>
described herein, inferences can be made regarding establishing DLS power save<br>
delivery parameters, negotiating traffic specifications, determining a delivery power<br>
save mode to employ and the like. As used herein, the term to "infer" or "inference"<br>
refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system,<br>
environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data.<br>
Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a<br>
probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that<br>
is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a<br>
consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for<br>
composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results<br>
in the constructiori'of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored<br>
event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and<br>
whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.<br>

The power management module 206 can configure the power management mode of the mobile station 1000. For instance, the power management module 206 can change the state or mode of the mobile station 1000 from an awake or active mode to a sleep or power save mode. In addition, the power management mode 206 can transition the mobile station 1000 from a sleep mode to an active mode. The processor 1006 also can be connected to a DPSD module 208 that facilitates direct data transfers between the mobile station 1000 and other mobile station peers while enabling employment of power save mode.<br>

[0091]	Fig. 12 shows an example wireless communication system 1200. The<br>
wireless communication system 1200 depicts one access point 1210 and one mobile<br>
station 1250 for sake of brevity. However, it is to be appreciated that system 1200 can<br>
include more than one access point and/or more than one mobile station, wherein<br>
additional access points and/or mobile stations can be substantially similar or different<br>
from example access point 1210 and mobile station 1250 described below. In addition,<br>
it is to be appreciated that access point 1210 and/or mobile station 1250 can employ the<br>
systems (Figs. 1-3 and 10-11), timing diagrams (Figs. 4-5) and/or methods (Figs. 6-9)<br>
described herein to facilitate wireless communication there between.<br>
[0092]	At access point 1210, traffic data for a number of data streams is<br>
provided from a data source 1212 to a transmit (TX) data processor 1214. According to<br>
an example, each data stream can be transmitted over a respective antenna. TX data<br>
processor 1214 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data stream based on a<br>
particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br>
[0093]	The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data<br>
using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM). The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and can be used at mobile station 1250 to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated (e.g., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), etc.) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data<br>
 <br>
rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions<br>
performed or provided by processor 1230.<br>
[0094]	The modulation symbols for the data streams can be provided to a TX<br>
MIMO processor 1-220, which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for<br>
OFDM). TX MIMO processor 3 220 then provides Nr modulation symbol streams to<br>
NT transmitters (TMTR) 1222a through 1222t. In various embodiments, TX MIMO<br>
processor 1220 applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to<br>
the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0095]	Each transmitter 1222 receives and processes a respective symbol stream<br>
to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters,<br>
and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for<br>
transmission over the MIMO channel. Further, NT modulated signals from transmitters<br>
1222a through 1222t are transmitted from NT antennas 1224a through 1224t,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0096]	At mobile station 1250, the transmitted modulated signals are received<br>
by NR antennas 1252a through I252r and the received signal from each antenna 1252 is<br>
provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 1254a through 1254r. Each receiver 1254<br>
conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective signal, digitizes the<br>
conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a<br>
corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0097]	An RX data processor 1260 can receive and process the NR received<br>
symbol streams from NR receivers 1254 based on a particular receiver processing<br>
technique to provide Nr "detected" symbol streams. RX data processor 1260 can<br>
demodulate, deinterleave, and decode each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic<br>
data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 1260 is complementary<br>
to that performed by TX MIMO processor 1220 and TX data processor 1214 at access<br>
point 1210.<br>
[0098]	A processor 1270 can periodically determine which precoding matrix to<br>
utilize as discussed above. Further, processor 1270 can formulate a reverse link<br>
message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion,<br>
[0099]	The reverse link message can comprise various types of information<br>
regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link<br>
 <br>
message can be processed by a TX data processor 1238, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 1236, modulated by a modulator 1280, conditioned by transmitters 1254a through 1254r, and transmitted back to access point 1210.<br>
[00100]	At access point 1210, the modulated signals from mobile station 1250 are<br>
received by antennas 1224, conditioned by receivers 1222, demodulated by a demodulator 1240, and processed by a RX data processor 1242 to extract the reverse link message transmitted by mobile station 1250. Further, processor 1230 can process the extracted message to determine which precoding matrix to use for determining the beamfonning weights.<br>
[00101]	Processors 1230 and 1270 can direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage,<br>
etc.) operation at access point 1210 and mobile station 1250, respectively. Respective processors 1230 and 1270 can be associated with memory 1232 and 1272 that store program codes and data. Processors 1230 and 1270 can also perform computations to derive frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively.<br>
[00102]	Access point 1210 and mobile station 1250 may support 802.11<br>
standards, such as 802.1 lb, 802. lie, 802.1 lg, 802.1 In, etc. 802.1 lg is backward<br>
compatible with 802.1 \ b and supports all of the operating modes defined by 802.1 \ b.<br>
Access point 12 i 0 and mobile station 1250 may further support a range extension mode,<br>
which supports at least one data rale that is lower than the lowest data rate in 802.31 b/g.<br>
The lower data rate(s) may be used to extend coverage range, which is beneficial for<br>
certain applications such as walkie-talkie. For instance, access point 1210 and mobile<br>
station 3 250 can support standard 802.11 b/g/n data rates ranging from 1 to 600Mbps<br>
and proprietary extension rate ranging from 0.25 to 3.0 Mbps.<br>
[00103]	For clarity, in the following description, the term "bit" refers to a<br>
quantity prior to modulation (or symbol mapping) at the transmitting station, the term "symbol" refers to a quantity after the symbol mapping, and the term "chip" refers to a quantity after spectral spreading. The term "sample" refers to a quantity prior to spectral despveading at the receiving station,<br>
[00104]	For IEEE 802.11, data is processed by a medium access control (MAC)<br>
layer as MAC protocol data units (MPDUs), Each MPDU is processed by a physical<br>
 <br>
layer convergence protocol (PLCP) and encapsulated in a PLCP protocol data unit (PPDU). Each PPDU is processed by a physical layer (as shown in FIG. 2) and transmitted via a wireless channel.<br>
[00105]	Fig. 13 shows am example PPDU structure 1300 used by 802.1 lb/g/n.<br>
For PPDU structure 1300, a PPDU 1310 includes a PLCP preamble 1320, a PLCP header 1 330, and an MPDU 1340. MPDU 1340 carries traffic data for PPDU 1310 and has a variable length. PLCP preamble 1320 includes a PLCP synchronization (SYNC) field 1322 and a start frame delimiter (SFD) field 1324. SYNC field 1322 carries a fixed 128-bit sequence that may be used by a receiving station for signal detection, acquisition, and other purposes. The bits in the \ 28-bit sequence are denoted as do, di,...,d!27- SFD field 1324 carries a fixed 16-bit sequence that indicates the start of the PLCP header. PLCP header 1330 includes a SIGNAL field i 332 that indicates the data rate for the MPDU, a SERVICE field 1334 that is set to '0' to signify compliance with IEEE 802.11, a LENGTH field 1336 that indicates the amount of time (in units of microseconds) required to send MPDU 1340, and a CRC field 1338 that carries a CRC value generated based on the SIGNAL, SERVICE, and LENGTH fields. PLCP preamble 1320 and PLCP header 1330 are sent at 1 Mbps using DBPSK. PLCP preamble 1320 contains a total of 144 bits, which are processed to generate 144 BPSK symbols. Each BPSK symbol is composed of 11 output chips, which are obtained by spreading that BPSK symbol with the 11 chips of the Barker sequence. The 144 BPSK symbols are transmitted in 144 symbol periods, with each symbol period having a duration of 1 microsecond (fas).<br>
