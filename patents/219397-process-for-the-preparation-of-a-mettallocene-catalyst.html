				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a metallocene catalyst. The present invention also relates to catalysts for olefin polymerisation, in particular to catalysts which comprise a metal bonded to a pentahapto (η5) cyclopentadienyl moiety, fused to at least one 6-membered ring.<br>
In olefin polymerizations, it has long been known to use as a catalyst system the combination of a metallocene procatalyst and an alumoxane co-catalyst or catalyst activator.<br>
By "metallocene" is meant here a metal complex which comprises at least one ligand complexed to a metal and having a hapticity of 2 or greater, for example 2 to 5, especially 5. Metallocenes which comprise one or more pentahapto (η5) ligands, for example the cyclopentadienyl ligand, have assumed greatest importance and the subsequent discussion will focus mainly on but is not limited to this subtype of multihapto-containing metal-ligand complexes.<br>
The metallocene may for example be a so-called "open sandwich" or "half sandwich" compound in which the metal is complexed by a single multihapto η.b ligand; a "sandwich" compound in which the metal is complexed by 2 or more such ligands; a "handcuff compound" in which the metal is complexed by a bridged bis-multihapto ligand, for example a bis-η5-ligand; or a "scorpionate compound" in which the metal is complexed by a multihapto (e.g. η5) ligand bridged to a η1 (for example a σ-bonded) ligand.<br>
Metallocenes have been much used in the copolymerization of olefins, especially ethylene, propylene, other α-olefins and higher olefins, in the presence of a co-catalyst/catalyst activator such as an alumoxane.<br>
Alumoxanes are compounds with alternating aluminium and oxygen atoms, generally compounds of formula I or II<br>
R2A1—(0—AlR)p—0—AIR2       (I)<br>
RA1—(0—AlR)p—0--AIR        (II)<br>
where each R, which may be the; same or different, is a, C1-10 alkyl group, and p is an integer having a value between 0 and 40) .  These compounds may be prepared by-reaction of an aluminium alkyl with water.  The production and use of alumoxanes is described in the patent literature, especially the patent applications of Texas Alkyls, Albemarle, Ethyl, Phillips, Akzo Nobel, Exxon, Idemitsu Kosan, Witco, BASF and Mitsui.<br>
Traditionally, the most widely used alumoxane is methylalumoxane (MAO), an alumoxane compound in which the R groups are methyl groups.  MAO however is poorly characterised, appears to comprise a range of cage-like structures more complex than the simple linear or cyclic structures of formulae I and II, and is relatively expensive.  Accordingly, efforts have been made to use alumoxanes other than MAO.  Thus, for example WO98/32775 (Borealis) proposes the use of metallocene procatalysts with alumoxanes in which R is a C2-10 alkyl group, e.g. hexaisobutylalumoxane (HIBAO).<br>
The contents of WO98/32775 and all other publications referred to hereafter are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Much effort has been expended into the development of improved metallocene-containing catalyst systems on account of the economic importance of olefin polymers. Of particular relevance are the investigations into indenyl-containing metallocenes in which the 5-membered cyclopentadienyl ring bonds in a η5 fashion to the metal in the complex.  For example WO 97/28170 (Borealis) discloses investigations into the substitution of the 5-membered ring of the indenyl moiety with alkoxy, siloxy and other groups.  US Patent Nos. 5,672,668, 5,504,232 and 5,304,613 (all to Winter et al.) disclose, inter<br>
alia, handcuff compounds or other metal locenes comprised of indenyl-based complexes, particularly those in which the 6-membered ring in the indenyl moiety is functionalised with one or more hydrocarbyl or halohydrocarbyl substituents.<br>
US Patent No. 5,483,002 (to Seelert et al.} discloses similar types of bis indenyl-based metallocenes.  Exemplary of such 5,6 fused systems is the indenyl system.<br>
Chiral C2-symmetric bis(indenyl) ansa-metallocenes are precursors to highly active catalysts for stereoselective polymerisation of alpha-olefins.  The performance characteristics of these systems are different, the variations being induced by size and position of the substituents.  For example, dimethylsilylene bridged 2,2'-dimethyl-4,4'-diaryl substituted bis(indenyl) zirconocenes developed by Brintzinger and co-workers (Organometallies 1994, 13, 964) and Spaleck et al. (Organometallies 1994, 13, 954), catalyse the production of isotactic polypropylenes with catalyst activities and polymer properties comparable to those obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts.<br>
Research into electronically altered indenyl and bis(indenyl) metallocenes, however, has remained relatively sparse.  So too are reports of electronically modified indenyloid and bis( indenyloid) ligands.  As used herein, the term indenyloid is intended to embrace the general class of anions formed by the deprotonation of any 5,6-fused system whereby to form a cyclopentadienyl  η5 ligand fused to a 6 -membered ring. Indenyl itself may be considered as the parent indenyloid but will be' referred to as indenyl here.  The fluorenyl ligand is an example of an indenyloid ligand.<br>
Previously, it has been reported that halogen or alkoxy substitution in the six-membered rings of indenes reduces the activity of the catalyst system and the<br>
molecular weight of the produced polymer (Consiglio et al., Organometallies 1990, 9, 3098; Collins et al. , Organometallies 1992, 11, 2115).  Bis(indenyl) zirconocenes with 2-amino functionalised Uganda have been reported by several groups (Luttikhedde et al., Organometallies 1996, 15, 3092; Plenio and Burth, J. Organomet. Chem. 1996, 519, 269; Brintzinger et al., J. Organomet. Chem. 1996, 520, 63).  The bridged complexes show somewhat lower catalytic activities compared with their unsubstituted bis(indenyl) zirconocene analogues.<br>
WO 97/28170 (supra) does in some way address this neglected area.  However, this publication addresses the issue of electronically modifying, by way of substitution, the. 5-membered ring of indenyl and indenyloid compounds whereby to produce metallocene compounds in which an oxygen atom is directly bonded to the 2-position of a n5 indenyl moiety.<br>
However, there have been no reports of metallocenes in which the 6-membered ring of an indenyl or indenyloid ring has been electronically modified by substitution by a pendant heteroatom attached group at the 4- or 7-position (i.e. a position adjacent to an atom participating in both the 5- and 6-membered rings).<br>
Surprisingly, however, it has been found that a number of such compounds, viz metallocenes coordinated by a  η5 indenyl or indenyloid moiety in which a 6-membered ring fused directly or indirectly to the 5-membered ring is substituted by a siloxy or germyloxy group, exhibit advantageous properties.  These complexes, when used as procatalysts in α-olefin polymerisation, allow the production of α-olefin homo or copolymers with notably higher molecular weight than achievable with analogous compounds in which the 6-membered ring is not substituted by a siloxy or germyloxy group.  Moreover the activity of these complexes in polymerisations is high, as measured by the quantity of polymer produced per unit time against the<br>
quantity of metallocene used/ and in copolymerisations, the complexes of the invention result in higher, comonomer incorporation than do analogous compounds in which the 6-membered ring is not substituted by a si lory or germyloxy group.<br>
Viewed from one aspect, therefore the present invention provides a metallocene catalyst in which the metal is coordinated by a  η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indeiiyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4- 5-, 6- or 7-position, preferably the 4- or 7-position, by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group.<br>
As used herein the term metallocene catalyst is intended to embrace the actual catalytic species.  This may be the metallocene compound itself or a metallocene procatalyst by which term is meant a compound which may be brought into a catalytically active state (e.g. for catalysis of α-olefin polymerization) by reaction with a co-catalyst or catalyst activator, e.g. an aluminium alkyl or other aluminium compound or a boron compound.<br>
The metal will generally be a transition metal or lanthanide, especially a Group 3 (i.e. including scandium) to Group 7 (i.e. including manganese) transition metal, particularly a Group 4 to 6 metal, in particular Zr, Ti or Hf.  For the avoidance of doubt, lanthanide metals herein include lanthanum itself.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect, the invention provides an olefin polymerisation catalyst system comprising or produced by the reaction of:<br>
(i)   a metallocene catalyst in which the metal is coordinated by a η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4- 5-, 6- or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group; and<br>
(ii)  a cocatalyst/catalyst activator, e.g. an<br>
aluminium alkyl compound, in particular an alumoxane, especially an aluminum alkyl compound comprising alkyl groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Alternatively, said aluminum alkyl compound may be one which contains at least two carbon atoms.<br>
Viewed from a still further aspect, the invention provides a process for olefin polymerisation comprising polymerising an olefin in the presence of a metallocene catalyst in which the metal is coordinated by a η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indeny] or indenyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4- 5-, 6-or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group.<br>
Viewed from a yet another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of a metallocene catalyst which comprises metallating a η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety with a transition metal or lanthanide, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4- 5-, 6- or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group.<br>
Alternatively, it will be understood that the metallocene catalyst may be produced by the exchange of a metal ion in an existing metallocene for another metal ion through transmetallation.<br>
Viewed from a different aspect, the invention provides an olefin polymer produced in a polymerisation process catalysed by an olefin polymerisation catalyst system comprising or produced by the reaction of<br>
(i)   a metallocene catalyst in which the metal is coordinated by a η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4- 5-, 6- or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group; and<br>
(ii)  a cocatalyst/catalyst initiator, e.g. an aluminium alkyl compound, in particular an alumoxane,,<br>
• especially an aluminum alkyl compound comprising alky:; groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Alternatively, said aluminum alkyl compound may be one which contains at least two carbon atoms.<br>
Viewed from an alternative aspect, the invention provides the use in olefin polymerisation of a metallocene catalyst in which the metal is coordinated by a η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4-5- , 6- or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group.<br>
By directly or indirectly is meant that the pendant siloxy or germyloxy group is either directly bonded to one of the carbon atoms at position 4, 5, 6 or 7 (throughout this specification the numbering of carbon atoms is derived from the IUPAC numbering scheme for the indenyl ring) or is attached to one of these atoms, for example, by way of one or more intervening atoms, which may form a fused ring.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, however, the invention does not relate to metallocene catalysts containing only <br>
η5 cyclopentadienyl ligands which form part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety which contain only one or more directly bonded siloxy or germyloxy substituents at the 1-, 2- or 3- positions and no other siloxy or germyloxy substituents elsewhere.<br>
Thus the catalyst of the invention may for example be a compound of formula (III) :<br>
(Lig)p M (X)m (A)n	(III)<br>
in which:<br>
M is a transition metal ion or a lanthanide metal ion ;<br>
p is 1 or 2;<br>
m is greater than or equal to 0,-<br>
n is greater than or equal to 0;<br>
n+m is equal to the valency of the metal not satisfied by ligand or ligands Lig;<br>
X is a ligand which co-ordinates to M (for example a ηb hydrocarbyl, η1 hydrocarbyl, halo, hydrocarbyl amino or hydrocarbyl amido ligand) ;<br>
A is a σ-ligand as defined hereinafter; and<br>
each ligand Lig which may be the same or different is a  η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is directly or indirectly substituted at the 4-5~, 6- or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group, for example (Lig) p may be one or two of ligands In as defined hereafter.<br>
M in the metallocene catalysts of the invention is preferably a group 4 to 6 transition metal, e.g. a metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W. However, the metal is preferably Cr, Ti, Zr or Hf, particularly Cr if M is liganded by a single multihapto group or Ti, Zr or Hf if M is  η-liganded by one or more multihapto groups.<br>

By a a~ligand moiety is meant a group bonded to the metal at one or more places via a single atom, eg a hydrogen, halogen, silicon, carbon, oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atom.  Examples of such ligands include:<br>
halogenides (e.g. chloride and fluoride),<br>
hydrogen,<br>
triC1_12 hydrocarbyl-silyl or -siloxy(e.g.<br>
trimethylsilyl),<br>
triC1-6 hydrocarbylphosphimido (e.g.<br>
triisopropylphosphimido) ,<br>
C1-12 hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy (e.g.. methyl, ethyl,<br>
phenyl, benzyl and methoxy) ,<br>
diC1-6 hydrocarbylamido (e.g. dimethylamido and<br>
diethylamido), and<br>
5 to 7 ring membered heterocyclyl (e.g. pyrrolyl,<br>
furanyl and pyrrolidinyl).<br>
The siloxy or germyloxy indenyl or indenyloid ligands used according to the various aspects of the invention may be prepared by any convenient means, for example by reaction of a corresponding indanone, or analogue thereof (for example a 9-fluorenone) in which a 6-membered ring fused to the 5-membered ring is directly or indirectly substituted with a hydroxyl group.  Such compounds (e.g. 2-hydroxy-9-fluorenone and 4- and 5-hydroxy-indanone, which may be purchased from Aldrich) are commercially available.  Alternatively, appropriate hydroxy-substituted indenes or other polycyclic<br><br>
structures containing the indene skeleton and with one or more appropriate hydi~oxyl groups, may be used at-starting materials.<br>
These starting materials may be reacted with a compound of formula (R1)3QHal wherein R3 and Q are as defined above and Hal is an appropriate halide, for example chloride, bromide or iodide (chloride being preferred) in a suitable solvent, for example N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dichloromethane.<br>
Covalent catalysis may be used to assist in such reactions, e.g. effective quantities of triethylaraine, 1,8-diazobicyclo[5,6,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or imidazole may be employed.<br>
Where the starting materials comprise more than one hydroxyl group such reactions permit the formation of mono- or bis-substituted siloxy or germyloxy compounds. Moreover, it is also possible to react an appropriate starting indanone, for example 4-hydroxy-indan-l-one with two equivalents of compound of formula (R1)3QHal, which may or may not be the same, to afford the corresponding bis ether of 1,4-dihydroxy-ind-l-ene through trapping of the enol tautomer.<br>
The appropriate siloxy or germyloxy compounds may then be converted by, for example, a two-step process involving converting the indanone into a hydrazone (e.g. by reaction with tosyl hydrazine), in the presence of an effective amount of sulfuric acid in methanol; followed by reaction of the so-formed hydrazone with an appropriate base, e.g. an organolithium compound, such as methyllithium or butyllithium.  The parent reaction here is commonly known as the Shapiro reaction. Particular bases of use in this regard include t-BuLi, n-BuLi, lithium diisopropylamide, t-BuOK, trialkylamines, dialkyl-magnesium, alkylmagnesium chloride, alkyl CuLi and dialkyl zinc which may be used in conjunction with a suitable, solvent.  If necessary, a donor such as dimethoxyethane may be added to the<br>
reaction medium containing the hydirazone prior to addition of the base.<br>
Alternatively, the keto group in the indanone may simply be reduced under standard conditions (e.g. sodium borohydride in methanol and/or tetrahydrofuran (THF)} followed by dehydration to form the desired indene or iixdene skeleton-containing compound.<br>
If the formation of a bisindenyl or bisindenyloid ligand (i.e. a "handcuff" ligand as herein before defined) is desiirable, two equivalents (which may or may not be the same) of 1H- or 3H-indene etc. may be reacted with an appropriate base, e.g. an organolithium compound, such as methyllithium or butyllithium. Particular bases and solvents of use in this regard are as hereinbefore defined.  If necessary, a donor such as dimethoxyethane may be added to the reaction medium containing the appropriate 1H- or 3H-indene etc. prior to addition of the base.<br>
The anion or anions, as appropriate, may be reacted with a molecule of formula LG1-L-LG2 (wherein L is as hereinbefore defined and LG2 and LG2 represent any appropriate leaving groups which may or may not be the same, for example bromide, tosyl, chloride etc., whereby to form the desired Jbisindenyl ligand.  Alternatively, a "handcuff" ligand may be formed by a two step process in which one equivalent of a first indenyl anion is reacted with one equivalent of LG1-L-LG2 and the resultant indene or equivalent molecule substituted with -L-LG2 may be reacted with a second molecule anion whereby to form the desired bis indenyl/bis indenyloid ligand.<br>
Alternatively, wherein R3 is of formula -L-Z, the indenyl to indenyl bridging may be achieved using the methods disclosed in WO96/38458 (Montell).<br>
Formation of the desired metallocene is effected by reacting the desired ligand with an appropriate quantity of base, e.g. an organolithium compound, such as methyllithium or butyllithium (i.e. where formation of a<br>
mono  η5 ligand is desired, one equiva3.erit of base is used and where a Jbisindenyl ligand is being used {i.e. a bis ry3 ligand) two equivalents of base may be used. Particular bases and solvents of use in this regard are as hereinbefore defined. If necessary, a donor such as dirnethoxyethane may be added to the reaction medium containing the appropriate 1H or 3H indene etc. prior to addition of the base.<br>
The ligand can be metallated conventionally, e.g. by reaction with a halide of the metal M, preferably in an organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon or a hydrocarbon/ ether mixture.  Bridged siloxy- or germyloxy cyclopentadienyl ligands may be constructed by reacting a siloxy- or germyloxy monocyclopentadienyl ligand with a bridging agent (e.g. Si(CH3)2Cl2) or with a bridging agent and a further η-ligand (e.g. a different cyclopentadienyl ligand or with an indenyl, fluorenyl, etc ligand).<br>
An alternative approach to the complexes is also envisaged where the siloxycyclopentadiene is reacted with Zr(NMe2)4 or Zr(CH2Ph)4 followed by Me3SiCl to yield the complex directly.  Also, trimethylsilyl (siloxy) cyclopentadiene reacts with ZrCl4 to afford the complex directly.        '<br>
 σ-ligands other than chlorine may be introduced by displacement of chlorine from an η-ligand metal chloride by reaction with appropriate nucleophilic reagent (e.g. methyl lithium or methylmagnesium chloride) or using, instead of a metal halide, a reagent such as tetrakisdimethylamidotitanium or metal compounds with mixed chloro and dimethylamido ligands.<br>

The cocatalyst of scheme 6 is particularly suitabJe in the preparation of isotactic polypropylene and i.he cocatalyst of scheme 7 is particularly suitable in hiqh temperature production of polypropylenes.<br>
The metallocene catalyst and cocatalyst may be introduced into the polymerization reactor separately or together or, more preferably they are pre-reacted arid their reaction product is introduced into the polymerization reactor.<br>
As mentioned above, the olefin polymerisation catalyst system of the invention comprises (i) a metallocene catalyst in which the metal is coordinated by a η5 cyclopentadienyl ligand which forms part of an indenyl or indenyloid moiety, characterised in that said moiety is substituted in the 4- or 7-position by a pendant siloxy or germyloxy group; and normally (ii) an aluminium alkyl compound (or other appropriate cocatalyst), or the reaction product thereof.<br>
While the aluminium alkyl compound may be an aluminium trialkyl (e.g. triethylaluminium (TEA)) or an aluminium dialkyl halide (e.g. diethyl aluminium chloride (DEAC)) , it is preferably an alumoxane, either MAO or an alumoxane other than MAO, such as an isobutylalumoxane, e.g. TIBAO (tetraisobutylalumoxane) or HIBAO (hexaisobutylalumoxane) .  Alternatively, however, the alkylated (e.g. methylated) metallocene catalysts of the invention may be used with other cocatalysts, e.g. boron compounds such as B(C6F5)3, C6H5N(CH3)2H:B(C6F5)4, (C6H5) 3C:B (C6F5) 4 or Ni (CN) 4 [B (C6F5) 3] 42' .<br>
However, when the metal in the catalyst is a group 3 transition metal, i.e. Sc, Y, La or Ac, no co-activator is required since such catalyst species are already in an active form, e.g. compounds of formula In2ScH wherein In is as hereinbefore defined and comprises 2 moieties of formula (IV).<br>
The metallocene catalyst and cocatalyst may be introduced into the polymerization reactor separately or<br>
together or,   more preferably  they are pre-reacted   and their reaction product   is   introduced  into  the polymerization reactor.<br>
If  desired the   catalyst,   catalyst/cocatalyst mixture or a  catalyst/cocatalyst  reaction product  may foe used  in unsupported  form,   e.g.   metallocene  and MAO can be   precipitated without  an actual  carrier material   and used as  such.     The metallocene  catalyst  or its reaction product with  the cocatalyst  may also be  introduced  into the polymerization  reactor  in supported  form,   e.g. impregnated into a porous particulate  support.<br>
The particulate  support material  used  is  preferably an organic or inorganic material,   e.g.   a polymer   (such as  for example polyethylene,   polypropylene,   an ethylene-propylene  copolymer,   another polyolefin or polystyrene or  a  combination thereof).     Such polymeric  supports  may be  formed by precipitating a polymer or by a prepolymerization,   e.g.   of  monomers used in  the polymerization for  which the  catalyst  is  intended. However,   the support  is especially preferably a metal or metalloid oxide such as  silica,   alumina or  zirconia or a mixed oxide  such as  silica-alumina,   in particular silica,   alumina or silica-alumina.<br>
Especially preferably the support  is  a porous material  so that the metallocene may be loaded into the pores of the  support,   e.g.   using a process analogous to those described in WO94/14856   (Mobil),   WO95/12622 (Borealis)   and WO96/00243   (Exxon).     The particle  size  is not  critical  but  is  preferably in the  range   5   to 200 µm, more preferably 20  to  80 µm.<br>
Before  loading,   the particulate  support  material  is preferably calcined,   i.e.   heat  treated,   preferably under a non-reactive gas  such as nitrogen.     This treatment  is preferably at  a temperature in excess of  100°C,   more preferably 200°C or higher,   e.g.   200-800°C,   particularly about  300°C.     The  calcination treatment  is preferably effected for  several  hours,   e.g.   2  to 30 hours,   more<br>
preferably about 10 hours.<br>
The support may be treated with an alkylating agent before being loaded with the metallocene.  Treatment with the alkylating agent may be effected using an alkylating agent in a gas or liquid phase, e.g. in an organic solvent for the alkylating agent.  The alkylating agent may be any agent capable of introdiacing alkyl groups, preferably C1-6 alkyl groups and most especially preferably methyl groups.  Such agents are well known in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Preferably the alkylating agent is an organometallic compound, especially an organoaluminium compound (such as trimethylaluminium (TMA), dimethyl aluminium chloride, triethylaluminium) or a compound such as methyl lithium, dimethyl magnesium, triethylboron, etc.<br>
The quantity of alkylating agent used will depend upon the number of active sites on the surface of the carrier..  Thus for example, for a silica support, surface hydroxyls are capable of reacting with the alkylating agent.  In general, an excess of alkylating agent is preferably used with any unreacted alkylating agent subsequently being washed away.<br>
Following treatment of the support material with the alkylating ageiit, the support is preferably removed from the treatment fluid and any excess treatment fluid is allowed to drain off.<br>
The optionally alkylated support material is loaded with the catalyst.  This loading may be effected by using a solution of the catalyst in an organic solvent therefor, e.g. as described in the patent publications referred to above.  Preferably, the volume of catalyst solution used is from 50 to 500% of the pore volume of the carrier, more especially preferably 80 to 120%.  The concentration of catalyst compound in the solution used can vary from dilute to saturated depending on the amount of metallocene active sites that it is desired be loaded into the carrier pores.<br><br>
The active metal (i.e. the metal of the catalyst; is preferably loaded onto the support material at from 0.1 to 4%, preferably 0.5 to 3.0%-, especially 1.0 to 2.0%, by weight metal relative to the dry weight of the support material..<br>
After loading of the catalyst onto the support material, the loaded support may be recovered for use in olefin polymerization, e.g. by separation of any excess catalyst solution and if desired drying of the loaded support, optionally at elevated temperatures, e.g. 25 to 80°C.<br>
Alternatively, a cocatalyst, e.g. an alumoxane or an ionic catalyst activator (such as a boron or aluminium compound, especially a fluoroborate) may also be mixed with or loaded onto the catalyst support material.  This may be done subsequently or more preferably simultaneously to loading of the catalyst, for example by including the cocatalyst in the solution of the catalyst, by contacting the catalyst loaded support material with a solution of the cocatalyst or catalyst activator, e.g. a solution in an organic solvent, or by first impregnating the cocatalyst with a support and then contacting the cocatalyst impregnated<br>
support with a solution of the catalyst or neat catalyst {e.g. as described in WO96/32423) .  Alternatively however any such further material may be added to the catalyst-loaded support material in the polymerization reactor or shortly before dosing of the catalyst material into the reactor.<br>
In this regard, as an alternative to an alumoxane it may be preferred to use a fluoroborate catalyst activator for the alkylated catalysts, especially a B(C6Fs)3 or more especially a eB(C6F5)4 compound, such as C6Hc,N(CH3)2H:B(C6F5)4 or (C6H5) 3C:B (C6F5) 4.  Other borates of general formula (cation)a (borate)b where a and b are positive numbers, may also be used.<br>
As an alternative to the loading of the optionally<br>
alkylated support material with a solution of the procatalyst in an organic solvent, loeiding of the catalyst may be effected by mixing it with the optionally alkylated support material in the absence of solvents with said carrier at a temperature of at least 50°C but less than the vaporisation temperature of the metallocene compound.  The particular features of this method are disclosed in WO 96/32423 (Borealis).  If use of a cocatalyst/catalyst activator in such process is desired, this may be impregnated into the optionally alkylated support material prior to loading of the catalyst.<br>
Where such a cocatalyst or catalyst activator is used, it is preferably used in a mole ratio to the metallocene of from 0.1:1 to 10000:1, especially 1:1 to 50:1, particularly 1:2 to 30:1. More particularly, where an alumoxane cocatalyst is used, then for an unsupported catalyst the aluminium:metallocene metal (M) molar ratio is conveniently 2:1 to 10000:1, preferably 50:1 to 1000:1.  Where the catalyst is supported the Al:M molar ratio is conveniently 2:1 to 10000:1 preferably 50:1 to 400:1.  Where a borane cocatalyst (catalyst activator) is used, the B:M molar ratio is conveniently 2:1 to 1:2, preferably 9:10 to. 10:9, especially 1:1.  When a neutral triarylboron type cocatalyst is used the B:M molar ratio is typically 1:2 to 500:1, however some aluminium alkyl would normally also be used.  When using ionic tetraaryl berate compounds, it is preferred to use carbonium rather than ammonium counterions or to use B:M molar rat io 1:1.<br>
Where the further material is loaded onto the catalyst loaded support material, the support may be recovered and if desired dried before use in olefin polymerization.<br>
The olef in polymerized in the method of the invention is preferably ethylene or an alpha-olefin or a mixture of ethylene and an α-olefin or a mixture of<br>
alpha olefins, for example C2-20 olefins, e.g. ethylene, propene, n-but-l~ene, n-hex-1-ene, 4-methyl-pent-1 - -ene, n-oct-1-ene etc.  The olefins polymerized in the method of the invention may include any compound which includes urisaturated polymerizable groups.  Thus for example unsaturated compounds, such as C6_20 olefins (including cyclic and polycyclic olefins (e.g. norbornene)) , and polyenes, especially C6_20 dienes, may be included in a comonomer mixture with lower olefins, e.g. C2_5 α-olefins,.  Diolefins (i.e. dienes) are suitably used for introducing long chain branching into the resultant polymer.  Examples of such dienes include α, w linear dienes such as 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,8-nonadiene, 1,9-decadiene, etc.<br>
In general, where the polymer being produced is a homopolymer it will preferably be polyethylene or polypropylene.  Where the polymer being produced is a copolymer it will likewise preferably be an ethylene or propylene copolymer with ethylene or propylene making up the major proportion (by number and more preferably by weight) of the monomer residues.  Comonomers, such as C4_6 alkenes, will generally be incorporated to contribute to the mechanical strength of the polymer<br>
product.<br>
Usually metallocene catalysts yield relatively narrow molecular weight distribution polymers; however, if desired, the nature of the monomer/monomer mixture and the polymerization conditions may be changed during the polymerization process so as to produce a broad bimodal or multimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD) in the final polymer product.  In such a broad MWD product, the higher molecular weight component contributes to the strength of the end product while the lower molecular weight component contributes to the processability of the product, e.g. enabling the product to be used in extrusion and blow moulding processes, for example for the preparation of tubes, pipes, containers,<br>
etc.<br>
A multimodal MWD can be produced using a catalyse material with two or more different types of active polymerization sites, e.g. with one such site provided by the metallocene on the support and further sates being provided by further catalysts, e.g. Ziegler catalysts, other metallocenes, etc. included in the catalyst material.<br>
Polymerization in the method of the invention may be effected in one or more, e.g. 1, 2 or 3, polymerization reactors, using conventional polymerization techniques, e.g. gas phase, solution phase, slurry or bulk polymerization.<br>
In general, a combination of slurry (or bulk) and at least one gas phase reactor is often preferred, particularly with the reactor order being slurry (or bulk) then one or more gas phase.<br>
For slurry reactors, the reaction temperature will generally be in the range 40 to 110°C (e.g. 85-110°C) , the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 5 to 80 bar (e.g. 50-65 bar), and the residence time will generally be in the range 0.3 to 5 hours (e.g. 0.5 to 2 hours) .  The diluent used will generally be an aliphatic hydrocarbon having a boiling point in the range -70 to +100°C.  In such reactors, polymerization may if desired be effected under supercritical conditions.<br>
For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature: used will generally be in the range 60 to 115°C (e.g. 70 to 110°C), the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 10 to 25 bar, and the residence time will generally be 1 to 8 hours.  The gas used will commonly be a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen together with monomer (e.g. ethylene) .<br>
For solution phase reactors, the reaction temperature used will generally be in the range 130 to 270°C, the reactor pressure will generally be in the<br>
range 20 to 400 bar and the residence time will generally be in the range 0.005 to 1 hour.  The solvent used will commonly be a hydrocarbon with a boiling point in the range 80-200°C.<br>
Generally the quantity of catalyst used will depend upon the nature of the catalyst, the reactor types and conditions and the properties desired for the polymer product.  Conventional catalyst quantities, such as described in the publications referred to herein, may be used.<br>
