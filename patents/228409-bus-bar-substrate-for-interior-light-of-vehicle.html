				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a bus bar substrate<br>
for an interior light of a vehicle.  The bus bar substrate<br>
is- installed in an interior light mounted to the inner side<br>
of a roof of the vehicle.  The bus bar is mounted to the bus<br>
bar substrate in order to supply power to a lamp when a door<br>
is opened or a switch is operated.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
. A related circuit for turning on a lamp in an interior<br>
light of a vehicle comprises bus bars (used for connecting a<br>
power supply, a switch, and the lamp) fitted to grooves<br>
disposed in the back surface of a base formed by injection<br>
molding.  Such a circuit is disclosed in, for example,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-<br>
180372.  Switching on the switch causes the power supply and<br>
the lamp, disposed in the base, to be connected by the bus<br>
bar, thereby turning on the lamp.<br>
In the aforementioned interior light of the vehicle,<br>
the circuit is a simple circuit used only for turning on and<br>
off the lamp in the base.  Therefore, it is possible to form<br>
the circuit only by using the bus bar in the back surface of<br>
the base.  An increasing number of recent vans have interior<br><br>
lights disposed at three rows of seats,that is, a front<br>
seat (driver's seat), a rear seat, and an intermediate seat<br>
disposed between the front seat and the rear seat.  There is<br>
a demand for separately controlling the flashing of the    <br>
interior lights at the rear seat and at the intermediate    J<br>
seat by operating a switch installed at the interior light<br>
at the driver's seat.<br>
In order to separately.c.gntrol the.	interior lights	at<br>
the three rows of seats, a sophisticated circuit is formed.<br>
Therefore, when bus bars are disposed only at the back<br>
surface of the base, unless the bus bars are crossed, it<br>
becomes impossible to construct a circuit network for<br>
controlling the flashing of the lamps or it becomes very<br>
difficult to design a circuit pattern.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is achieved to overcome the<br>
aforementioned problems.  Its object is to provide a bus bar<br>
substrate for an interior light of a vehicle.  Bus bars are<br>
disposed at a base plate accommodated in a base, and a<br>
connector terminal is disposed for connecting switches and<br>
lamps and interior lights for an intermediate seat and a<br>
rear seat by using the bus bars.  This makes it possible to<br>
control a plurality of interior lights, requiring a<br>
sophisticated circuit network, at one location.<br><br>
To this end, according to a first aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a bus bar substrate for an<br>
interior light of a vehicle.  The bus bar substrate<br>
comprises an insulating base plate having grooves in the<br>
front and back surfaces thereof, and bus bars fitted to the<br>
grooves of the insulating base plate.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a bus bar substrate for an interior light<br>
of a vehicle.  The bus bar substrate comprises an insulating<br>
base plate having a plurality of securing holes, and bus<br>
bars having stopper portions for fitting to the securing<br>
holes of the insulating base plate.  The bus bars are<br>
secured to the front and back surfaces of the insulating<br>
base plate via the securing holes.<br>
In a first form, the bus bars have stopper portions<br>
disposed at predetermined locations thereof, and the<br>
insulating base plate has securing holes for receiving the<br>
stopper portions.<br>
In a second form, ends of the stopper portions of the<br>
bus bars have bulges that are pushed into walls defining the<br>
securing holes so as not to become dislodged therefrom.<br>
In a third form, an end of a predetermined one of the<br>
bus bars fitted to both surfaces of the insulating base<br>
plate is lead out to a connector box of the insulating base<br>
plate and is defined as a connector terminal.<br><br>
In a fourth form, the bus bars to be secured to the<br>
front and back surfaces of the insulating base plate have<br>
portions that are connected by bridges so that each bus bar<br>
is one unsevered member, and, after securing the bus bars to<br>
the insulating base plate, each bridge is severed at a small<br>
hole disposed in the insulating base plate in correspondence<br>
with the location of its associated bridge, so that a<br>
circuit is formed.<br>
In a fifth form, predetermined ones of the bridges of<br>
the bus bars secured to the front and back surfaces of the<br>
insulating base plate overlap in the same small hole, and<br>
are severed at the same small hole in order to electrically<br>
connect the bus bars.<br>
As mentioned above, according to the present invention,<br>
securing the bus bars to the front and back surfaces of the<br>
insulating base plate makes it possible to form a<br>
sophisticated circuit without crossing the bus bars.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to prevent short-circuit accidents<br>
caused by the crossed bus bars.<br>
Fitting the stopper portions of the bus bars to the<br>
securing holes formed in the insulating base plate makes it<br>
possible to reliably secure the bus bars and the insulating<br>
base plate.  In addition, the bulge at the end of each<br>
stopper portion is pushed into the wall surface defining<br>
each securing hole so as not to become dislodged from the<br><br>
corresponding securing hole.  Therefore, it is possible to<br>
more reliably secure the bus bars and the insulating base<br>
plate.<br>
An end of the bus bar is inserted into the connector<br>
box of the insulating base plate and is defined as a<br>
connector terminal.  This connector terminal makes it is<br>
possible to electrically connect to other interior lights.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to control the flashing of a<br>
plurality of interior lights by one interior light.<br>
After securing the bus bars, used to form a circuit<br>
pattern, to the insulating base plate while their portions<br>
are connected by bridges, it is possible to sever the<br>
bridges in order to form the circuit pattern.  Therefore, it<br>
is possible to simplify the mounting operation of the bus<br>
bars to the insulating base plate.<br>
By severing the bridges of the bus bars secured to the<br>
front and back surfaces of the insulating base plate in the<br>
same small hole formed in the insulating base plate, and by<br>
integrally forming these severed portions, it is. possible to<br>
electrically connect the bus bars used to form the circuit<br>
pattern.  Therefore, this structure is effective in, for<br>
example, simplifying the designing of the circuit.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A bus bar substrate for an interior light of a vehicle<br>
according to the present invention comprises an insulating<br>
base plate having grooves formed in the front and back<br>
surfaces and bus bars fitted to the grooves of the<br>
insulating base plate.<br>
First Embodiment<br><br>
A bus bar substrate for an interior light of a vehicle<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 4.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an entire vehicle illuminating light.<br>
Reference numeral 1 denotes a box-shaped base that is formed<br>
by, for example, injection molding, and that is divided into<br>
three chambers along the longitudinal direction.  The left<br>
and right chambers accommodate lamps and push switches.<br>
Lens plates la are rotatably supported at shafts in a<br>
cantilever manner towards the center of the base.<br>
Pressing the lens plates la at sides opposite to the<br>
supporting points of the lens plates la causes the push<br>
switches to be turn on, causing the lamps to turn on.<br>
Pressing the lens plates la again causes the push switches<br>
to be turned off, causing the lamps to turn off.  A vehicle<br>
interior light having such a structure is disclosed in, for<br>
example, Japanese Patent Application No. 11-161944 (Laid-  |<br>
i<br>
Open No. 2000-344010) filed by the applicant of the       jj<br>
invention.<br>
Bus bars (not shown) connecting the lamps and the push<br>
switches are mounted to the back surface of the base.  In<br>
addition, at the back surface of the base, the bus bars are<br>
such that connector terminals at the bus bar substrate<br>
(described below) of the present invention and connector<br>
terminals connected via lead wires are integrally formed.<br><br>
An operation box 2 accommodated in the center chamber<br>
of the base 1 has the structure shown in Fig. 2.  The<br>
operation box 2 comprises a front plate 21, a bus bar<br>
substrate 22 of the present invention screwed in the front<br>
plate 21, a back plate 23 integrated with the front plate 21<br>
by engaging a pawl 23a with a hole 21a in the front plate 21<br>
from the back side, and a movable contact member 24<br>
accommodated in an accommodation portion 21b of the front<br>
plate 21 so as to be movable leftwards and rightwards in Fig.<br>
2.  A knob 24a of the movable contact member 24 protrudes<br>
from a slot 21c of the front plate 21.<br>
The bus bar substrate 22 is illustrated in more detail<br>
in Figs. 3 and 4.  Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view of<br>
the bus bar substrate 22 in the same plane and as seen from<br>
the opposite side from Fig. 2 in the horizontal direction.<br>
Fig. 4 is an exploded perspective back view of the bus bar<br>
substrate 22 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The bus bar substrate 22 comprises an insulating base<br>
plate 221 and a pair of bus bars 222 and 223 mounted to the<br>
front and back surfaces of the insulating base plate 221.<br>
A connector box 221a, grooves 221b and 221c, small<br>
holes 221d, securing holes 221e, and separation protrusions<br>
221f are formed at the insulating base plate 221.  The<br>
connector box 221a comprises connectors.  The grooves 221b<br>
and 221c guide the bus bars 222 and 223 (described later).<br><br>
The small holes 221d receive portions of divided bridges<br>
223e (described later).  The securing holes 221e receive<br>
stopper portions 222c and 223c (described later).  The<br>
separation protrusions 221f prevent shorting between<br>
adjacent stationary contacts 222a and 223a disposed in<br>
parallel, and allows smooth sliding of the movable contact<br>
member 24.<br>
The bus bar 222 comprises the stationary contacts 222a,<br>
a connector terminal 222b, and the stopper portion 222c.<br>
The stationary contacts 222a are stationary with respect to<br>
the movable contact member 24.  The connector terminal 222b<br>
is accommodated in the connector box 221a.  The stopper<br>
portion 222c is inserted in the securing hole 221d and is<br>
pushed into an inner wall defining the securing hole 221d so<br>
as not to become dislodged.  An arrow-shaped bulge 222d is<br>
formed at an end of the stopper portion 222c.<br>
The bus bar 223 is disposed opposite to the bus bar 222<br>
with the insulating base plate 221 being disposed between<br>
the bus bars 222 and 223.  Whereas the bus bar 222 is not<br>
divided into bus bar portions, the bus bar 223 is divided<br>
into three bus bar portions that are connected by the<br>
bridges 223e.  Similarly to the bus bar 222, each portion of<br>
the bus bar 223 comprises a stationary contact 223a, a<br>
connector terminal 223b, and a stopper portion 223c having a<br>
bulge 223d.<br><br>
A method for incorporating the bus bars 222 and 223 in<br>
the front and back surfaces of the insulating base plate 221<br>
will be described.  While fitting the bus bar 222 to the<br>
groove 221b of the insulating base plate 221, the stopper<br>
portion 222c is inserted into the securing hole 221d, the<br>
connector terminal 222b is inserted into and secured to the<br>
connector box 221a, and base portions of the stationary<br>
contacts 222a are fitted along the separation protrusions<br>
221f, so that the base bar 222 is secured to the insulating<br>
base plate 221.<br>
Next, similarly, while the bus bar 223 is being fitted<br>
to the groove 221c formed in the opposite surface of the<br>
insulating base plate 221, the stopper portions 223c are<br>
inserted into the securing holes 221d, the connector<br>
terminals 223b are inserted into and secured to the<br>
connector box 221a, and base portions of the stationary<br>
contacts 223a are fitted along the separation protrusions<br>
221f, so that the bus bar 223 is secured to the insulating<br>
base plate 221.<br>
For the base bar 223, three base bar portions are<br>
connected by the bridges 223e, so that the base bar portions<br>
do not form a circuit network.  Therefore, it is necessary<br>
to sever the bridges 223e and form electrically separate<br>
portions.  Accordingly, in the next step, a pin is secured<br>
at a location of a presser opposite to substantially the<br><br>
central portion of a bridge 223e, and the pin is pushed<br>
towards the bridge 223e, causing two severed portions to<br>
enter the small hole 221d disposed at the back side of the<br>
central position of the bridge 223e.  As a result, the bus<br>
bar 223 is divided into individual bus bar portions, thereby-<br>
forming the circuit network (see Fig. 7).<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
As described above, in the first embodiment, the bus<br>
bars 222 and 223 are fitted to the grooves 221b and 221c in<br>
the front and back surfaces of the insulating base plate 221,<br>
and the stopper portions 222c and 223c are inserted into and<br>
secured to the securing holes 221d.  In the second<br>
embodiment, bus bars 222 and 223 are secured to an<br>
insulating base plate 221 only by inserting stopper portions<br>
222c and 223c into and securing them to securing holes 221d.<br>
Arrow-shaped bulges 222d and 223d which are pushed into<br>
inner walls defining the securing holes 221d by being<br>
inserted into the securing holes 221d are formed at ends of<br>
the stopper portions 222c and 223c.  Therefore, the bus bars<br>
222 and 223 are not dislodged from the insulating base plate<br>
221.  Inserting the stopper portions 222c and 223c into the<br>
securing holes 221d causes the bus bars 222 and 223 to be<br>
positioned with respect to the insulating base plate 221.<br><br>
As described above, according to the present invention,<br>
the bus bars 222 and 223 are disposed at the front and back<br>
surfaces of the insulating base plate 221 by fitting the bus<br>
bars 222 and 223 to the grooves 221b and 221c at the front<br>
and back surfaces of the insulating base plate 221 and<br>
inserting the stopper portions 222c and 223c into the<br>
securing holes 221d, or by only inserting the stopper<br>
portions 222c and 223c into the securing holes 221d.<br>
Therefore, even a sophisticated circuit network can be<br>
easily formed.<br>
If bus bars that are disposed at the front and back<br>
surfaces of the insulating base plate 221 have structures<br>
like the bus bar 223 having portions connected by bridges,<br>
when the bridges are severed in the same small holes 221d<br>
from the front and back, the small severed portions of the<br>
bridges overlap in the small hole.  Therefore, the bus bars<br>
at the front and back surfaces of the insulating base plate<br>
221 are electrically connected.  Consequently, the<br>
insulating base plate 221 can be used in the same way as<br>
generally used printed circuit boards, and the pattern<br>
design freedom is increased, thereby allowing the designing<br>
to be easily carried out.  If the small severed portions of<br>
the bridges do not properly contact each other, they may be,<br>
for example, soldered in order to achieve proper contact.<br><br>
