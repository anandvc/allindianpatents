				<td>The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-309657 filed on November 15, 2006 including specification, drawings and claims is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a child seat anchor apparatus and a partition trim.<br>
In a typical vehicle, there is provided a partition panel inside the vehicle to define an interior and a trunk. Specifically, the partition panel is disposed from the lower end of a back window opening to the front side of the vehicle and blocks a portion between the peripheral area of the upper end portion of a seatback of a rear seat and the lower end portion of the back window opening. Further, in the vehicle having a child seat mounted on the rear seat, a tether anchor for locking a tether of the child seat is fixed on the upper surface of the partition panel in the front side of the vehicle by the use of a bolt. Additionally, an opening for opening the upper portion of the tether anchor is formed on the partition trim covering the partition panel from the upside.<br>
At this time, an outer appearance may not look good in the case where the opening is opened, For this reason, in Patent Document 1, there<br>
was provided a cover on the partition trim to open or close the opening" while moving around a horizontal axis on the rear side.<br>
Additionally, in Patent Document 2, there was provided a technology that is designed to allow the tetter anchor to protrude from the upside of the opening and attach a box-like shaped cover moving vertically to be opened or closed to the tether anchor in the periphery of a thin hinge on the rear side, so that an anchor non-use time when the cover covers the tether anchor and an anchor use time when the tether anchor is exposed are switched to each other.<br>
Patent Document 1:   Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002- 104037A Patent Document 2:   Japanese Patent No. 3489274<br>
However, in the configuration in Patent Document 1, since the cover moves around the horizontal axis to be opened or dosed, a problem may arise in that the structure is complicated and attaching work needs much trouble because the number of parts of a rotation mechanism increases. Additionally, a rear view may be interrupted since the cover is upright from the upper surface of the partition trim at the anchor use time when the tether of the child seat is attached to the tether anchor. Further, the cover may be deformed or slipped out from the partition trim when an alien substance is jammed therein.<br>
In the configuration in Patent Document 2, since the box-like shape<br>
cover protrudes from the upper portion of the partition trim, a problem may arise in that the outer appearance does not look good at the anchor non-use time when the tether of the child seat is not attached to the tether anchor because the cover and the partition trim do not appear to be one member.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a child seat anchor apparatus that is designed to reduce the number of parts, improve attaching workability, improve an outer appearance at the use time when a tether of a child seat is attached to a tether anchor or at the non-use time when the tether of the child seat is not attached to the tether anchor, and prevent a situation that a cover is deformed or slipped out from a partition trim when an alien substance is jammed therein without interrupting1 a rear view even in use, and a partition trim of the child seat anchor apparatus.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a child seat anchor apparatus, comprising: a partition panel disposed in the rear of a seat; a tether anchor attached to the partition panel and adapted to be coupled to a tether of a child seat; a partition trim covering the partition panel from above and formed with a opening disposed above the tether anchor,' and a cover movable along a face of the partition trim to open and close the opening.<br>
According to the above-described configuration, since the cover for<br>
opening or dosing the opening while moving1 along the surface of the partition trim is provided, it is possible to decrease the number of the parts when compared to the related-art cover opening or closing means with the rotation mechanism. Accordingly, the structure can be configured to be simple and attaching workability can be improved. Further, since the cover does not protrude above the partition trim when the cover is opened, the rear view is not interrupted and there is no possibility that an ah'en substance is jammed in the cover. Furthermore, since the cover and the partition trim, easily appear to be one member at the anchor non-use time when the tether of the child seat is not attached to the tether anchor, title outer appearance can look good at the anchor non-use time.<br>
The partition trim may include a curved protruding portion protruding upward and having an arc shape when viewed from the side! and the opening may be formed in the curved protruding portion.<br>
Since the opening is formed in the curved protruding portion, it is possible to open the front portion and the upper portion of the tether anchor when the cover is opened. Accordingly, since the front portion of the tether anchor is opened, interference between the tether and a peripheral portion of the opening can be prevented. Further, since the upper portion of the tether anchor is opened, the tether can be easily attached to the tether anchor.<br>
For example, in the structure in which the opening is formed in an inclined plane that is formed in the partition trim so as to protrude its rear<br>
portion, a problem may arise in that the length of the opening in front and back directions of the vehicle and up and down directions thereof is made long when opening areas of the front portion and the upper portion of the opening at the time of opening the cover are required to have the same s&amp;e as that of the above-described configuration according to the invention. As a result, the size of the opening increases too much. Conversely, in the configuration according to the invention, it is possible to attain the opening that has a small size and that opens the front portion and the upper portion of the tether anchor in a desired size by forming the opening in the curved protruding portion. Accordingly, the structure can be configured to be simple and the outer appearance can be further improved.<br>
The child seat anchor apparatus may further comprise a guide unit formed on a rear face of the partition trim to guide the cover in a cover moving direction, the guide unit being formed with a first guide groove portion extending in the cover moving direction so that one side of the cover is slidable on the first guide groove, and a second guide groove portion extending in the cover moving direction so that another side of the cover is slidable on the second guide groove.<br>
Since the guide unit for guiding the cover is formed in the rear face of the partition trim, the guide unit can be hidden therein. Accordingly, the outer appearance can be improved and the cover and the partition trim can easily appear to be one member. Further, since the first guide groove portion for sliding and guiding the one side of the cover and the second guide<br>
groove portion for sliding and guiding the another side of the cover are provided, tie cover can be smoothly and securely opened or closed with a<br>
simple structure.<br>
First protrusions having an arc shape when viewed in cross section may be formed on front and rear faces of the cover at the one side of the cover so as to slide on a pair of groove faces of the first guide groove portion; and second protrusions having an arc shape when viewed in cross section may be formed on front and rear faces of the cover at the another side of the cover so as to slide on a pair of groove faces of the second guide groove portion.<br>
Since the first protrusions and the second protrusions slide on the groove faces, a friction resistance between the groove faces and the first and second protrusions decreases. Accordingly, the cover can be smoothly opened or dosed and both surfaces of the cover can be prevented from being jammed in the groove surfaces. Further, a damage occurring on the both faces of the cover can be prevented and the outer appearance of the cover can be improved.<br>
The rear face of the partition trim may include one of the groove faces of the first guide groove portion and one of the groove faces of the second guide groove portion.<br>
With the above configuration, the cover can be approached to the opening of the partition trim in the thickness direction of the partition trim.<br>
Accordingly, the cover and die partition trim can easily appear one member and the outer appearance can be further improved,<br>
The child seat anchor apparatus may further comprise: a first guide wall having a rib shape, extending in the cover moving direction and protruding from the rear face of the partition trim; and a second guide wall having a rib shape, extending in the cover moving direction and protruding from the rear face of the partition trim. The first guide groove portion may be formed in a base end of the first guide wall and the second guide groove portion is formed in a base end of the second guide wall. The first guide wall and the second guide wall may be elastically deformable in a direction away from each other. Side faces of the first and second guide walls, which face each other may be formed into taper faces so as to increase widths of the first and second guide walls toward the opening,<br>
As described above, in a process of attaching the cover to the partition trim, the one and the another sides of the cover is first brought into contact with the pair of side faces of the first guide wall and the second guide wall from the rear side of the partition trim; when the cover is pushed to the opening, the one and the another sides of the cover is guided along the pair of side faces so that the first guide wall and the second guide wall are elastically deformed and widened; and the one and the another sides of the cover is fitted into the first guide groove portion and the second guide groove portion, respectively, and the first guide wall and the second guide wall is elastically restored so that the cover is attached to the partition trim. That<br>
is, the cover can be easily attached to the partition trim just by pushing the cover to the opening from the rear side of the partition trim. Accordingly, attaching workability is further improved.<br>
The child seat anchor apparatus may further comprise: a handle for opening and closing the cover, formed on and protruded from a front face of the cover and positioned at one end of the cover in the cover moving direction; a first cover receiving portion formed on the taper face of the first guide wall, positioned at one end of the first guide wall and having a first cover receiving face perpendicular to a protruding direction of the first guide wall; and a second cover receiving portion formed on the taper face of the second guide wall, positioned at one end of the second guide wall and having a second cover receiving face perpendicular to a protruding direction of the second guide wall. The handle and the first and second cover receiving portions may be positioned so as to prevent the cover from being1 attached to the partition trim upside down.<br>
In the process of attaching the cover to the partition trim, when the cover is pushed to the opening upside down in the cover moving direction, the following (A) or (B) may be performed.<br>
That is, (A) the first and second cover receiving faces of the first and second cover receiving portions receive the one and the another sides of the cover. Since the first and second cover receiving faces are perpendicular to the protruding direction of the first and second guide walls, a pressing force of the cover is transmitted to the first guide wall and the second guide wall in<br>
the direction opposite to the protruding direction. Accordingly, the first guide wall and the second guide wall are not deformed and widened in a direction away from each otter since a component of the pressing force transmitted to the first guide wall and the second guide waH in the width direction is not generated, Therefore, the cover cannot enter and fitted into the first and second guide groove portions.<br>
Alternatively, (B) since the handle comes into contact with the rear face of the partition trim, tile cover cannot be attached to the partition trim. In terms of (A) and CB) described above, it is possible to prevent the cover from being attached to the partition trim upside down in the cover moving direction in the attachment process.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided the partition trim of the child seat anchor apparatus described above, wherein a first convex portion is formed on and protruded from the rear face of the partition trim to form a first engagement groove between the first convex portion and one end of the first guide wall; a second convex portion is formed on and protruded from the rear face of the partition trim to form a second engagement groove between the second convex portion and one end of the second guide wall; and the partition trim is adapted to attach a dosing cover instead of the cover, the closing cover having a first projection adapted to engage with the first engagement groove, a second projection adapted to engage with the second engagement groove such that the closing cover is fixed to the partition trim while closing the opening.<br>
When the partition trim with the above-described configuration constitutes the child seat anchor apparatus, the same advantage as described above can be obtained. With such a configuration, it is possible to attach the partition trim with the above-described configuration to a vehicle not having the childe seat anchor apparatus.<br>
That is, one and the another sides of the dosing cover for normally closing the opening instead of the cover which can be opened or closed, are brought into contact with the pair of guide faces of the first guide wall and the second guide wall from the rear side; when the closing cover is pushed toward the opening, the one and the another sides of the closing cover is guided along the pair of guide faces so that the first guide wall and the second guide wall are elastically deformed and widened; the one and the another sides of the dosing cover are fitted into the first and second guide groove portions and the first and second guide walls are elastically restored. In addition, the first projection which projects out in a width direction of the dosing cover is engages with the first engagement groove; a second projection which projects out in the width direction of the dosing cover engages with the second engagement groove, so that the dosing cover is attached.<br>
The movement of the dosing cover in the longitudinal direction (which is the cover moving direction) of the first guide wall and the second guide wall is prevented by engagements of the first and second projections of the closing cover and the first and second engagement grooves. Additionally, the movement of the dosing cover in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction is prevented since the one and<br>
the another sides of the closing cover are fitted into the first and second guide groove portions, respectively. As described above, it is possible to attach the closing cover to the partition trim just by pushing the closing: cover toward the opening from the rear side of the partition trim. Accordingly, attaching workability of the closing cover can be improved.<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, it is possible to provide a child seat anchor apparatus that is designed to reduce the number of parts, improve attaching workability, improve an outer appearance at the use time when a tether of a child seat is attached to a tether anchor or at the non-use time when the tether of the child seat is not attached to the tether anchor, and prevent a situation that a cover is deformed or slipped out from a partition trim when an alien substance is jammed therein without interrupting a rear view even in use.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, it is possible to provide the partition trim with the same advantage as described when the partition trim constitutes the child seat anchor apparatus. Further, it is possible to provide the partition trim with a common feature between vehicles having the child seat anchor apparatus and not having the child seat anchor apparatus.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter,   exemplary  embodiments  of the invention  will be<br>
described with reference to the drawings.   As shown in Pig. 1, a child seat<br>
101 is disposed at the center of a rear seat 100 of a vehicle, and a seat belt<br>
105 is inserted through a horizontal belt hole 104 formed on both side<br>
portions 103 of a seat 102 of the child seat 101 so as to be fixed thereto.   In<br>
this way, the child seat 101 is attached to the rear seat 100.   As shown in<br>
Figs. 2 and 3, a tether anchor 2 that fixes a tether 108 of the child seat 101 is<br>
attached to a partition panel 1 that is disposed in rear of the rear seat 100 to<br>
define a vehicle interior and a trunk.   The tether 108 of a belt 107 attached<br>
to the upper end of a rear portion 106 of the child seat 101 is coupled with<br>
and locked to the tether anchor 2.   The tether anchor 2 is attached to the<br>
partition panel 1 via a spacer 111 by the use of the bolt 112 and a nut 113.<br>
The nut 113 is fixed to the rear surface of the partition panel 1 by a welding<br>
process.     A partition panel portion below  the  tether  anchor 2  is<br>
strengthened by a strengthening plate 14.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, a child seat anchor apparatus 50 is configured such that an opening 4 for opening the upside of the tether anchor 2 is formed in a partition trim 3 covering the partition panel 1 from the upside, and a cover 5 for opening or dosing the opening 4 while moving along both surfaces 3M and 3N of the partition trim 3 are provided. Three child seat anchor apparatuses 50 are arranged in the vehicle width direction at a uniform distance (see Fig. l). The partition trim 3 engages witibt a vehicle body in the periphery of a back window glass 16 by the use of a locking claw that is formed in the rear portion in a form of a single member, and is fixed to<br>
the upper surface of the partition panel 1 by the use of a dip. Additionally, the left and right portions of the partition trim 3 engage with the lower end of an interior trim of a rear filler, the rear end thereof is disposed in the periphery of the back window glass 16, and the front side portion thereof curves downward along a seatback of the rear seat 100, At this time, the partition trim 3 is fixed to the vehicle body even in the position in which the partition trim 3 curves downward and is hidden by the seatback. Next, the child seat anchor apparatus 50 will be described in detail.<br>
A curved protruding portion 6 with a convex arc shape in a side view is formed on the side of the rear seat 100 of tile partition trim 3, and the opening 4 is formed on the curved protruding portion 6 from the top point thereof toward the front side of the vehicle. The opening 4 has the same left and right widths and has a rectangular shape when viewed from the front side of the vehicle. The cover 5 is made of a resin material and formed in an arc shape along the curved protruding portion 6 when viewed from the side of the vehicle. Additionally, the cover 5 is formed in a rectangular shape when viewed from the front side of the vehicle. That is, the cover 5 is formed in a shape in which a rectangular flat plate is curved in an arc shape. The cover 5 moves along £he both surfaces 3M and 3N of the partition trim 3 in the obliquely front and back directions of the vehicle. A mark representing an existence of an anchor is formed on the surface of the cover 5 (see Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)), and a pair of strengtheniag ribs 77 are provided on the rear surface.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4, 6(a), and 6(b), a guide unit 7 for guiding the cover 5 is provided on the rear surface of the partition trim 3. The guide unit 7 includes a first guide groove portion 11 for sliding and guiding one side portion 15 of the cover 5 and a second guide groove portion 12 for sliding and guiding the other side portion 25 of the cover 5, Thus, the cover 5 is of a slide type.<br>
Each of first protrusions 31 with an arc shape in a sectional view that slides on a pair of guide groove surfaces 11M1 and 11M2 of the first guide groove portion 11 is formed on both surfaces of the one side portion 15 of the cover 5. Also, each of second protrusions 32 with an arc shape in a sectional view that slides on a pair of guide groove surfaces 12M1 and 12M2 of the second guide groove portion 12 is formed on both surfaces of the other side portion 25 of the cover 5. As shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), the first protrusion 31 is constituted by a plurality of protrusions 3 la that are arranged at a predetermined distance from each other in the direction in which the cover 5 is opened or closed, and also the second protrusions 32 is constituted by a plurality of protrusions 32a that are arranged at a predetermined distance from each other in the direction in which the cover 5 is opened or closed. The groove surface 11M1 on the one side of the first guide groove portion 11 and the groove surface 12M1 on the one side of the second guide groove portion 12 are configured by the rear surface 3U of the partition trim 3 (see Figs. 6{a) and 6(b)).<br>
The first guide groove portion 11 is formed in an attachment portion<br>
of a first guide wall 41 with a rib shape protruding' from the rear surface 3U<br>
of the partition trim 3 so as to open toward the second guide groove portion<br>
12 in a U shape in a sectional view.   Also, the second guide groove portion<br>
12 is formed in an attachment portion of a second guide wall 42 with a rib<br>
shape protruding from the rear surface 3U of the partition trim 3 so as to<br>
open toward the first guide groove portion 11 in a U shape in a sectional view.<br>
As a plurality of horizontal through holes 8 (see Figs. 4 and 6(a)) are formed<br>
on the attachment portions of the first guide wall 41 and the second guide<br>
wall 42 in the longitudinal direction thereof at a distance from each other,<br>
the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 are configured to be<br>
elastically deformable in the direction in which they separate from each<br>
other.   Additionally, a pair of opposed side walls 41M and 42M positioned on<br>
the front ends in the protruding direction T of the first guide wall 41 and the<br>
second guide wall 42 are formed into taper surfaces (inclined surfaces),<br>
respectively so as to increase widtihs of the first guide wall 41 and the second<br>
guide wall 42 toward the opening 4 (see Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)X   Since a<br>
plurality of the horizontal through holes 8 are formed on the attachment<br>
portions of the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 in the<br>
longitudinal direction thereof at a distance from each other, it is possible to<br>
prevent a shrinkage (a partial sinking occurring in a forming process) on the<br>
surface of the partition trim 3.<br>
Meanwhile, in an attachment process of attaching the cover 5 to the partition trim 3, one side portion 15 and the other side portion 25 of the cover 5 are brought into contact with the pair of side surfaces 41M and 42M of the<br>
first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 from the rear aide of the partition trim 3. Subsequently, at the time of pushing the cover 5 to the opening: 4, the one side portion 15 and the other aide portion 25 of the cover 5 are guided along the pair of guide surfaces 41M and 42M using the taper surfaces formed on the side walls 41M and 42M so that the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 are widened against an elastic force. Subsequently, the one side portion 15 and the other side portion 25 are fitted into the first guide groove portion 11 and the second guide groove portion 12, respectively, and the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 are elastically restored. Consequently, the cover 5 is attached to the partition trim 3.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2, 3, 7(a), and 7(b), an opening or closing handle 9 is formed on and protruded from the front surface of the upper end portion 5A of the cover 5 in the opening direction Jl of the cover 5. The opening or dosing handle 9 is positioned at the center of the width direction of the cover 5. At this time, a closing side surface 9A (which is a surface facing an upper portion in the opening direction) of the opening or closing handle 9 erects at a right angle relative to the both surfaces of the cover 5 and protrudes to the upside thereof while passing through the opening 4. When the opening 4 is closed by the cover 5, the opening or closing handle 9 comes into contact with a peripheral portion 4S1 on the closing side of the opening 4, so that the closing side is controlled. Conversely, when the opening 4 is opened, the opening or closing handle 9 comes into contact with a peripheral portion 4S2 on the opening side of the opening 4, so that the opening side is controlled.<br>
Each of first engagement convex portions 10A with a semicircular shape is formed on both side surfaces of the upper end 5A of the cover 5 in the opening direction Jl of the cover 5 so as to protrude in the width direction of the cover 5 (see Fig.  7(b)).     Additionally, each of first engagement holes 10B engaging with the first engagement convex portion 10A is formed on the upper end portion 41A of the first guide wall 41 and the upper end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 in the opening direction. That is, when the cover 5 is closed (when completely closed), the first engagement convex portions 10A on the left and right sides of the cover 5 engage with the first engagement holes 10B, so that a position of the cover 5 is fixed thereto (see Fig. 6(b)).   The upper end portion 41A of the first guide wall 41 and the upper end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 in the opening direction are positioned in the periphery of the peripheral portion 4S1 on the closing side of the opening 4 in the opening or closing direction of the cover 5.   The lower end of the first guide wall 41 and the lower end of the second guide wall 42 in the opening direction are positioned more in the lower side of the opening direction than the peripheral portion 4S2 on the opening side of the opening 4.   In other words, the length of the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 in the opening or closing direction of the cover 5 is almost 1.5 times that of the opening 4 in the opening or dosing direction (the invention is not limited to this value).<br>
Each of second engagement holes 206 engaging with each of the first engagement convex portions 10A is formed in the middle of the first guide<br>
wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 in the longitudinal direction. When the cover 5 is completely opened, each of the first engagement convex portions 10A on the left and right sides of cover 5 engages with each of the second engagement holes 20B, so that the position of the cover 5 is fixed thereto. For example, when the tether engages with the tether anchor and an opening degree of the opening 5 is necessary to be minimized, it is possible to fix the position of the opening 4 by disposing the second engagement holes 20B on desired positions in the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42, and then engaging the first engagement convex portions 10A with the second engagement holes 20B.<br>
[Means for Preventing Erroneous Attachment]<br>
As shown in Figs. 4,6(a), and 6(b), each of cover receiving portions 13 for receiving the cover 5 pushed to the opening 4 upside down in the opening or closing direction thereof is formed on the upper end portion 41A of the first guide wall 41 and the upper end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 in the opening direction Jl. A cover receiving surfaces 13M that are perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the protruding direction T in which the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 protrude are formed on the cover receiving portions 13, respectively. Each of tihe cover receiving surfaces 13M are positioned at another cover receiving portion side of the each of cover receiving portions 13. Accordingly, when the cover 5 is pushed to the opening 4 with a posture of a direction opposite to the opening or dosing direction in the attachment process, the cover receiving surface 13M receives the one side portion 15 and the other side portion 25 of the<br>
cover 5, or the opening or closing handle 9 comes into contact with the rear surface 3U of the partition trim 3 to prevent an erroneous attachment. The cover receiving portion 13 may be formed such that a protruding portion is formed on the taper surfaces (inclined plane) that are formed on the pair of opposed side surfaces 41M and 42M of the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 in the manner that the widths of the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 becomes larger toward the opening 4.<br>
For example, when an attachment operation is conducted in a state that the cover 5 deviates to the lower side in the opening direction Jl with respect to the opening 4 so that the lower end portion 5B (that is, one side portion and the other side portion of the lower end portion 5B of the cover 5 in the opening direction) of the cover 5 in the opening direction Jl is not received to the cover receiving portion 13, the opening or dosing handle 9 comes into contact with the rear surface 3U of the partition trim 3. Aad thus, the attachment operation cannot be completed. Additionally, when an attachment operation is conducted in a state that the position of the cover 5 deviates to the upper side in the opening direction Jl compared to the above-described attachment operation, the end portion 5B Cower end portion 5B of the cover 5 in the opening direction Jl) of the cover 5 is received to (comes in contact with) the cover receiving surface 13M of the cover receiving portion 13. And thus, the attachment operation cannot be completed. In order to exhibit the effect, a length (which is a length when viewed from the side) between the peripheral portion 4S2 on the opening side of the opening 4 and the edge 13a on the cover opening side of the cover receiving portion 13 is configured to be shorter than a length (which is a length when viewed from<br>
the side) between the rear surface of the opening or closing' handle 9 and the edge 5b on the side of the lower end portion 5B of the cover 5 in the opening direction Jl.<br>
[Attachment Structure of Closing Cover 60]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a first convex portion 51 for forming a first engagement groove 53A between the first convex portion 51 and the upper end portion 4lA of the first guide wall 41 in the opening direction Jl of the cover 5 is formed on and protruded from the rear surface 3U of the partition trim 3 at the upper side of the upper end portion 41A of the first guide wall 41 in the opening direction Jl. Also, a second convex portion 52 for forming a second engagement groove 53B between the second convex portion 52 and the upper end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 in the opening direction Jl of the cover 5 is formed on and protruded from the rear surface 3U of the partition trim 3 at the upper side of the upper end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 in the opening direction Jl. The first engagement groove 53A and the second engagement groove 53B are provided in order to position a dosing cover 60 (see Fig. 8(a) and 8(b)), which normally covers the opening 4 instead of the cover 5, in the partition trim 3.<br>
The closing cover 60 is made of a resin material and has the substantially same size as the cover 5. The different points from the cover 5 are as below. Protrusions 71 are formed on only the rear surfaces of one side portion 61 and the other side portion 62 of the closing cover 60 so as to follow along the opening direction Jl. A first projection 63 that protrudes<br>
out in the width direction from one upper portion 6lA of the dosing cover 60 in the opening direction Jl and a second projection 64 that protrudes out in the width direction from the other upper portion 62A of the closing cover 60 in the opening direction Jl are provided. Each of cutouts 65 for preventing an interference with the cover receiving portion 13 is formed in the peripheries of the first projection 63 and the second projection 64. Bach of third engagement convex portions 70 with a hemispherical shape protrudes from side surfaces of the ends 60B (the lower end portion 60B in the opening direction Jl) of the one side portion 61 and the other side portion 62 of the closing cover 60 so as to engage with the second engagement holes 20B.<br>
[Attachment Method of Closing Cover 60]<br>
The closing cover 60 with the above-described configuration is configured to be attached to the partition trim 3 in the same manner as the cover 5. That is, the one side portion 61 and the other side portion 62 of the dosing cover 60 are brought into the pair of side surfaces 41M and 42M of the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 from the rear side of the partition trim, respectively, and the dosing cover 60 is pushed to the opening 4. At the time of pushing the dosing cover 60, the one side portion 61 and the other side portion 62 of the dosing cover 60 are guided along the pair of side surfaces 41M and 42M so that the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 are widened against an elastic force, Subsequently, the one side portion 61 and the other side portion 62 of the dosing cover 60 are fitted into the first guide groove portion 11 and the second guide groove portion 12, respectively, and also the first guide wall 41 and the second guide wall 42 are<br>
elastically restored.    Additionally, the first projection 63 is disposed between the first convex portion 51 and the end portion 41A of the first guide wall 41 so as to engage with the first engagement groove 53A, the second projection $4 is disposed between the second convex portion 52 and the end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 so as to engage with the second engagement groove 53B, and the third engagement convex portion 70 engages with the second engagement hole 20B.   Further, since the cutouts 65 are formed on the closing cover 60, it is possible to prevent the cover receiving portion 13 from interfering with the dosing cover 60.   In this way, as shown in Fig. 5, the dosing cover 60 is attached to the partition trim 3. In order to easily engage the first projection 63 and the second projection 64 with the first engagement groove 53A and the second engagement groove 53B, respectively, at the time of pushing the dosing cover 60, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the cover receiving surface 13M of the cover receiving portion 13 is formed in an arc shape when viewed from the side.   That is, front end portions of the end portion 41A of the first guide wall 41 and the end portion 42A of the second guide wall 42 in the protruding direction T that faces the first convex portion 51 and the second convex portion 52 are formed in an arc shape so as to easily insert the first projection 63 and the second projection 64 therein.<br>
