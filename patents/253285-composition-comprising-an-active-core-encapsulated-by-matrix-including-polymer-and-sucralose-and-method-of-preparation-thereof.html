				<td>FIELD<br>
Included are encapsulated compositions including a polymer and sucralose. The<br>
compositions include an encapsulant including a polymer in combination with sucralose.<br>
Methods of preparing the encapsulated compositions are also provided.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Encapsulated intense sweeteners have a particular advantage when included in gum<br>
compositions such as chewing gum and bubble gum compositions. The encapsulated<br>
sweeteners are not immediately released as sugar would be when included in a chewing gum.<br>
By contrast, an encapsulated sweetener composition provides extended sweetening on<br>
chewing because the sweetener is not released until the encapsulating material has been<br>
subjected to mastication.<br>
Intense sweeteners such as aspartame (APM) and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) have<br>
been used in encapsulated compositions in combination with high molecular weight polymers<br>
which allow for their slow release upon chewing in a gum composition.<br>
Sucralose is another popular intense sweetener which is derived from sucrose in<br>
which one or more hydroxy groups are replaced by chlorine atoms. This compound is<br>
described in U.K. Patent No. 1,543,167, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Sucralose may be referred to by different chemical names including: 4-chloro-4-<br>
deoxy-a-D-galactopyranosyl, l,6-dichlorol,6-dideoxy- P-D-fructofuranoside, and known as<br>
4,r,6',-trichloro-4,r,6'-trideoxygalactosucrose.<br>
Sucralose is relatively stable and inert. This includes exhibiting stability in acid<br>
aqueous solutions, in marked contrast to peptide-based sweeteners such as aspartame. Under<br>
completely dry conditions, however, sucralose which is present in a crystalline form tends to<br>
discolor in response to elevated temperatures. For example, such discoloration can be<br>
exhibited after twenty minutes of exposure of pure dry sucralose to a temperature of 100°C,<br><br>
wherein the color changes to a pale brown. This degradation of sucralose results in a<br>
commercially unacceptable product. This high temperature instability of sucralose has made<br>
it commercially impractical to prepare an encapsulated sucralose with the extrusion<br>
techniques used to prepare the encapsulated APM and Ace-K compositions using high tensile<br>
strength / softening point polymers.<br>
Since sucralose is a desirable sweetener, and is preferred for compositions where<br>
APM stability is questionable, there is a need for an encapsulated sucralose composition<br>
which may be used in a variety of compositions including gum compositions. Ideally, the<br>
encapsulated composition would include an active such as another sweetener, medicament,<br>
vitamin or flavor.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In some embodiments, there is a composition which includes an active and at least<br>
one coating layer. The coating layer includes polyvinyl acetate and sucralose and at least<br>
partially encapsulates the active.<br>
Also provided is a sucralose composition which includes a sucralose region and at<br>
least one encapsulating layer which includes a polymer such as polyvinyl acetate and<br>
sucralose.<br>
Some embodiments also provide a composition including a sucralose region and at<br>
least one coating layer contiguous with the sucralose region. The coating layer includes a<br>
polymer and sucralose; wherein the coating layer completely surrounds the sucralose region.<br>

includes:<br>
(a)	suspending, active particles in a fiuidizing air stream;<br>
(b)	preparing a coating composition including a polymer, sucralose, and a solvent;<br>
and<br>
(c)	spraying the coating composition onto the suspended active particles to<br>
provide an encapsulated composition.<br><br>

steps:<br>
(a)	suspending sucralose particles in a fluidizing air stream;<br>
(b)	preparing a coating composition including a polymer, sucralose, and a solvent;<br>
(c)	spraying the coating composition onto the sucralose particles to provide an<br>
encapsulated sucralose composition; and<br>
(d)	evaporating the solvent from the encapsulated sucralose composition.<br>

sweetness. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br>
spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In some embodiments wherein the active is a sweetener, it may be a high intensity<br>
sweetener such as sucralose, saccharin salts, acesulfame potassium, aspartame, thaumatin,<br>
neotame, alitame, and combinations thereof. More specifically, sucralose may be used alone<br>
or in combination with another sweetener either as the active or in the coating layer.<br>
The flavoring agents which may be used include those flavors known to the skilled<br>
artisan, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavorings may be chosen from synthetic<br>
flavor oils and flavoring aromatics and/or oils, oleoresins and extracts derived from plants,<br>
leaves, flowers, fruits, and so forth, and combinations thereof. Nonlimiting representative<br>
flavor oils include spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate),<br>
peppermint oil, clove oil, bay oil, anise oil, eucalyptus oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf oil, oil of<br>
nutmeg, allspice, oil of sage, mace, oil of bitter almonds, and cassia oil. Also useful<br>
flavorings are artificial, natural and synthetic fruit flavors such as vanilla, and citrus oils<br>
including lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit, and fruit essences including apple, pear, peach,<br>
grape, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, plum, pineapple, apricot and so forth. These flavoring<br>
agents may be used in liquid or solid form and may be used individually or in admixture.<br>
Commonly used flavors include rnints such as peppermint, menthol, spearmint, artificial<br>
vanilla, cinnamon derivatives, and various fruit flavors, whether employed individually or in<br>

In some embodiments, a flavoring agent may be employed in either liquid form and/or<br>
dried form. When employed in the latter form, suitable drying means such as spray drying the<br>
oil may be used. Alternatively, the flavoring agent may be absorbed onto water soluble<br>
materials, such as cellulose, starch, sugar, maltodextrin, gum arabic and so forth or may be<br>
encapsulated. The actual techniques for preparing such dried forms are well-known.<br>
In some embodiments, the flavoring agents may be used in many distinct physical<br>
forms well-known in the art to provide an initial burst of flavor and/or a prolonged sensation<br>
of flavor. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br>
spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of flavoring agent employed herein may be a matter of preference subject<br>
to such factors as the type of final chewing gum composition, the individual flavor, the gum<br>
base employed, and the strength of flavor desired. Thus, the amount of flavoring may be<br>
varied in order to obtain the result desired in the final product and such variations are within<br><br>
the capabilities of those skilled in the art without the need for undue experimentation. In gum<br>
compositions, the flavoring agent is generally present in amounts from about 0.02% to about<br>
5%, and more specifically from about 0.1% to about 2%, and even more specifically, from<br>
about 0.8% to about 1.8%, by weight of the chewing gum composition.<br>

The coating layer which surrounds the active, may also include a solvent. In addition<br>
to the sucralose and polymer, the solvent should be capable of dissolving the polymer, The<br>
solvent may be any solvent known for this purpose. For example, if the polymer is polyvinyl<br>
acetate, suitable solvents include of ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, acetone, benzene, ethylene<br>
dichloride, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, toluene, xylene, amyl acetate, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
One or more coating layers may be present. In some embodiments wherein more than<br>
one coating layer is present, the first coating layer may include sucralose and a high tensile<br>
strength polymer, with the optional addition of another sweetener. A second coating may<br>
completely or partially encapsulate the active particles and may include either a single<br>
polymer, a combination of different polymers, or a combination of one or rnore polymers and<br>
a sweetener such as sucralose.<br>
Polymers which may be used in the coating layers include acrylic polymers and<br>
copolymers, carboxyvinyl polymer, polyamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl<br>
acetate phthalate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and combinations thereof. One or more different<br>
polymers may be used in each of the coating layers. For example, polyvinyl acetate may be<br>
included in a first coating with a combination of polyvinyl acetate and another polymer in a<br>
subsequent exterior coating.<br>
The encapsulated particles of some embodiments may be prepared by any suitable<br>
spray coating method as known in the art. One suitable process is the Wurster process. This<br>
process provides a method for encapsulating individual particulate materials. First the<br>
particles to be encapsulated are suspended in a fluidizing air stream which provides a<br>
generally cyclic flow in front of a spray nozzle. The spray nozzle sprays an atomized flow of<br>
the coating solution, which will include sucralose, a polymer and a suitable solvent.<br>
The atomized coating solution collides with the particles as they are carried away<br>
from the nozzle to provide a particle coating with the coating solution. The temperature of<br>
the fluidizing air stream, which also serves to suspend the particles to be coated, may be<br>
adjusted to evaporate the solvent shortly after the coating solution contacts the particles. This<br>
serves to solidify the coating on the particles, resulting in the desired encapsulated particle.<br><br>
This process may be repeated until the desired thickness of the coating is achieved.<br>
Alternatively, 1he process may be repeated with a different coating solution to provide<br>
different and distinct coating layers in the encapsulated particle composition.<br>
Following the coating process, the particles may then be formed to an appropriate size<br>
as desired, generally from an average particle size range of about 50 µm to about 800 µm.<br>
This may be accomplished by any suitable means such as chopping, pulverizing, milling or<br>
grinding the particles.<br>
The gum compositions of some embodiments may include a gum base as well as the<br>
encapsulated active composition. The gum base may include any component known in the<br>
chewing gum art. For example, the gum base may include elastomers, bulking agents, waxes,<br>
elastomer solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers, fillers and mixtures thereof.<br>
The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of<br>
suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example,<br>
those polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation,<br>
natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero,<br>
rosidinha, jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, gutta kay,<br>
and the like, and combinations thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without<br>
limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
Additional useful polymers include: crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
polymethylmethacrylate; copolymers of lactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, plasticized<br>
ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetatephthalate and combinations thereof.<br>
The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br><br>
product. In general, the elastomer will be present, in the gum base in an amount from about<br>
10% to about 60% by weight of the gum region, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by<br>
weight<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base may include wax. It softens the polymeric<br>
elastomer mixture and improves the elasticity of the gum base. When present, the waxes<br>
employed will have a melting point below about 60°C, and preferably between about 45°C.<br>
and about 55°C. The low melting wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in the<br>
gum base in an amount from about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to about<br>
9.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
In addition to the low melting point waxes, waxes having a higher melting point may<br>
be used in the gum base in amounts up to about 5%, by weight of the gum base. Such high<br>
melting waxes include beeswax, vegetable wax, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, most petroleum<br>
waxes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition to the components set out above, the gum base may include a variety of<br>
other ingredients, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The gum base may contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer<br>
component. Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art,<br>
for example, terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl,<br>
glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as<br>
hydrogenated, dimerized and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
elastomer solvents suitable for use herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially<br>
hydrogenated wood and gum rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood rosin, the glycerol ester of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin,<br>
the glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and<br>
the partially hydrogenated methyl ester of wood and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum base in amounts from about 2% to about<br>
15%, and preferably from about 7% to about 11%, by weight of the gum base.<br><br>
The gum base may also include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing the immiscible<br>
components into a single stable system. The emulsifiers useful in this invention include<br>
glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides, propylene glycol<br>
monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be employed in<br>
amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and more specifically, from about 7% to about 11%,<br>
by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these<br>
ingredients, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of<br>
the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include<br>
lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl<br>
triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated<br>
monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Waxes, for example, natural<br>
and synthetic waxes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane<br>
waxes, polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes, fatty waxes, sorbitan<br>
monostearate, tallow, propylene glycol, mixtures thereof, and the like, may also be<br>
incorporated into the gum base. The plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in the<br>
gum base in amounts up to about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in<br>
amounts from about 9% to about 17%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Plasticizers also include are the hydrogenated vegetable oils and include soybean oil<br>
and cottonseed oil which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers<br>
provide the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizers and<br>
softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more<br>
specifically in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous<br>
conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the gum base of this invention may also include effective<br>
amounts of bulking agents such as mineral adjuvants which may serve as fillers and textural<br>
agents. Useful mineral adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate,<br>
calcium sulfate and the like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may be used in<br>
the gum base compositions in various amounts. The amount of filler, may be present in an<br>
amount from about zero to about 40%, and more specifically from about zero to about 30%,<br>
by weight of the gum base.<br>
A variety of traditional ingredients may be optionally included in the gum<br>
compositions in effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives,<br>
flavoring agents, and the like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food,<br>
drug and cosmetic applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant<br>
such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate,<br>
and mixtures thereof, may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives<br>
known to one having ordinary skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base.<br>
The gum composition may include amounts of conventional additives selected from<br>
the group consisting of sweetening agents (sweeteners), plasticizers, softeners, emulsifiers,<br>
waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral adjuvants,<br>
flavoring agents (flavors, flavorings), coloring agents (colorants, colorings), antioxidants,<br>
acidulants, thickeners, medicaments, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some of these<br>
additives may serve more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum compositions, a<br>
sweetener, such as maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a bulking agent.<br>
The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants<br>
discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing<br>
gum composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include<br>
emulsifiers, such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in<br>
combination with other softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan<br>
gum, gelatin, carob, tragacanth, locust bean gum, pectin, alginates, galactomannans such as<br>
guar gum, carob bean gum, glucomannan, gelatin, starch, starch derivatives, dextrins and<br>
cellulose derivatives such as carboxy methyl cellulose, acidulants such as malic acid, adipic<br><br>
acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumade acid, and mixtures thereof, and fillers, such as those<br>
discussed above under the category of mineral adjuvants.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum region may also contain a bulking agent. Suitable<br>
bulking agents may be water-soluble and include sweetening agents selected from, but not<br>
limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar alcohols, and mixtures<br>
thereof; randomly bonded glucose polymers such as those polymers distributed under the<br>
trade name POLYDEXTROSE by Pfizer, Inc., Groton, Conn.; isomalt (a racemic mixture of<br>
alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-mannitol and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L6-sorbitol manufactured<br>
under the trade name PALATINIT by Suddeutsche Zucker), maltodextrins; hydrogenated<br>
starch hydrolysates; hydrogenated hexoses; hydrogenated disaccharides; minerals, such as<br>
calcium carbonate, talc, titanium dioxide, dicalcium phosphate; celluloses; and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar bulking agents include monosaccharides, disaccharides and<br>
polysaccharides such as xylose, ribulose, glucose (dextrose), mannose, galactose, fructose<br>
(levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, invert sugar, partially hydrolyzed starch and com syrup<br>
solids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar alcohol bulking agents include sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol<br>
maltitol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable hydrogenated starch hydrolysates include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
25,959,3,356,811,4,279,931 and various hydrogenated glucose syrups and/or powders<br>
which contain sorbitol, hydrogenated disaccharides, hydrogenated higher polysaccharides, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of corn syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are<br>
mixtures of monomelic, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different<br>
saccharides give different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, such as LYCASIN, a commercially available product<br>
manufactured, by Roquette Freres of France, and HYSTAR, a commercially available product<br>
manufactured by Lonza, Inc., of Fairlawn, N.J., are also useful.<br><br>
Any sweetening agent or flavoring agent, as described above, may also be added as an<br>
optional component to the gum compositions.<br>
Coloring agents may be used in amounts effective to produce the desired color. The<br>
coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about<br>
6%, by weight of the gum composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated<br>
in amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the gum<br>
composition. The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food,<br>
drug and cosmetic applications. These colorants are known as F.D.&amp; C. dyes and lakes. The<br>
materials acceptable for the foregoing uses are preferably water-soluble. Illustrative<br>
nonlimiting examples include the indigoid dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Blue No.2, which is the<br>
disodium salt of 5,5-indigotmdisulfonic acid. Similarly, the dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Green<br>
No.l comprises a triphenylmethane dye and is the monosodium salt of 4-[4-(N-ethyl-p-<br>
sulfoniumbenzylamino)diphenylmemylene][l-(N-ethyl-N-p-sulfoniumbenzyl)-delta-2,5-<br>
cyclohexadieneimine]. A full recitation of all F.D.&amp; C. colorants and their corresponding<br>
chemical structures may be found in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology,<br>
3rd Edition, in volume 5 at pages 857-884, which text is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable oils and fats usable in gum compositions include partially hydrogenated<br>
vegetable or animal fats, such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef tallow, and lard, among<br>
others. These ingredients when used are generally present in amounts up to about 7%, and<br>
preferably up to about 3.5%, by weight of the gum composition.<br>
Some embodiments may include a method for preparing the improved chewing gum<br>
compositions for the gum region, including both chewing gum and bubble gum compositions.<br>
The chewing gum compositions may be prepared using standard techniques and equipment<br>
known to those skilled in the art. The apparatus useful in accordance with some embodiments<br>
comprises mixing and heating apparatus well known in the chewing gum manufacturing arts,<br>
and therefore the selection of the specific apparatus will be apparent to the artisan.<br>
