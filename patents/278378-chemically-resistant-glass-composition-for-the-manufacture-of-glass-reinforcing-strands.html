				<td>CHEMICALLY RESISTANT GLASS COMPOSITION FOR THE<br>
MANUFACTURE OF GLASS REINFORCING STRANDS<br>
The invention relates to a chemically resistant glass composition, in<br>
particular one having a high hydrolytic resistance, for the production of glass<br>
reinforcing strands, and to the organic and inorganic products (or composites)<br>
containing such strands.<br>
It has been known for a long time to use glass strands to reinforce<br>
organic and inorganic materials so as to give them better mechanical<br>
properties. Usually, the strands consist of a glass with the composition SiO2-<br>
Al2O3-CaO-B2O3 (called E-glass) that exhibits excellent hydrolytic and thermal<br>
resistance. However, this type of glass is not suitable for use in an alkaline<br>
medium, or in an acid medium.<br>
One means of improving the alkaline resistance consists in<br>
incorporating zirconium oxide ZrO2 into the glass composition. For example, it is<br>
known to use glass with a high ZrO2 content to reinforce cements, the basic<br>
character of which is very pronounced (pH possibly ranging up to 12.5).<br>
Numerous patents disclose glass compositions having a high ZrO2<br>
content.<br>
EP 0500325 A1 describes compositions for chemically resistant glass<br>
fibers that can be used as reinforcements in cement or in plastics. The<br>
compositions have, in mol%, a TiO2 content of 5 to 18%, a T1O2 + ZrO2 content<br>
of between 12 and 25%, a BaO content of 4 to 15% and an MgO, CaO, SrO,<br>
BaO and ZnO content of between 12 and 35%.<br>
JP 9156957 describes fiber made of glass resistant to alkalis, to acids<br>
and to water, which comprises 5 to 9 mol% TiO2 and possesses a T1O2 and<br>
ZrO2 content of between 13 and 17 mo!%.<br>
US 5064785 B discloses an alkaline-resistant glass composition for<br>
glass fibers, which contains 10 to 17 wt% Na2O and 0.5 to 7 wt% TiO2.<br>
JP 2000-186787 A describes a pipe (or tube) made of resin reinforced<br>
by fibers of glass resistant to alkalis and to acids, which contains 10 to 17 wt%<br>
Na2O.<br>
 <br>
WO 2004/035497 A1 describes fibers consisting of a glass composition<br>
comprising, in mol%, 50 to 60% SiO2, 0.5 to 20% TiO2, 20 to 45% MgO, CaO,<br>
SrO and BaO and 0 to 2% Li2O, Na2O and K2O, and having a BaO/CaO molar<br>
ratio between 0.3 and 16.<br>
US 6627569 B and US 6630420 B disclose glass compositions<br>
containing, in wt%, 0.5 to 7% AI2O3, less than 10% Na2O and K2O and more<br>
than 0.1% TiO2 or more than 0.6% La2O3.<br>
CN 1046147 A describes fiber made of alkaline-resistant glass<br>
comprising 11 to 14 wt% ZrO2 and 1 to 5.5 wt% TiO2.<br>
CN 1149031 A describes fiber made of alkaline-resistant glass<br>
containing 0.1 to 10 wt% TiO2 and 0.1 to 5 wt% CaF2.<br>
US 4014705 B discloses continuous fibers made of alkaline-resistant<br>
glass containing 3 to 9 mol% F2.<br>
Apart from their alkaline resistance, glasses having a high ZrO2 content<br>
generally exhibit good acid resistance.<br>
Strands consisting of a glass having a high proportion of ZrO2 that can<br>
be used to reinforce cement are sold under the trademark Cem-FIL®. They may<br>
also be used to reinforce polymer matrices, particularly polyester and vinyl ester<br>
polymers, in composites intended for being in contact with acid media<br>
(WO 2006/090030 A1).<br>
One drawback of the aforementioned glass strands is their hydrolytic<br>
sensitivity. The Applicant has in fact found that the materials and composites<br>
reinforced by these strands lose their mechanical strength when aged in a wet<br>
medium, in particular at high temperatures. In the case of composites with a<br>
polymer matrix, the glass strands no longer adhere properly to the matrix, this<br>
being manifested by whitening of the composite. Without wishing to be tied<br>
down by any particular theory, it seems that the whitening is due to exchange<br>
between the Na+ ions present on the surface of the glass and the protons<br>
contained in the aqueous medium. This causes degradation of the surface<br>
structure of the glass and, subsidiarily, a local increase in the proportion of OH"<br>
ions that favors rupture of the chemical bonds between the glass and the<br>
matrix. The amount of whitening is directly linked to the amount of Na2O in the<br>
glass composition.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a chemically resistant<br>
 <br>
glass composition which has in particular an improved hydrolytic resistance,<br>
while still maintaining good resistance to acids and alkalis, and which may be<br>
processed under the usual conditions in existing fiberizing installations.<br>
This object is achieved thanks to a chemically resistant glass<br>
composition for the production of strands, this composition being characterized<br>
in that it comprises the following constituents within the limits defined below,<br>
expressed in mol%:<br>
 <br>
the composition furthermore containing less than 1% of impurities (AI2O3,<br>
Fe2O3, Cr2O3, TiO2, MgO, SrO, BaO and P2O5) and being free of F.<br>
According to one feature of the invention, the glass composition<br>
satisfies the following relationship:<br>
2.5% 
thereby making it possible to guarantee that the fiberizing takes place under<br>
satisfactory conditions, that is to say that the difference between the strand<br>
forming temperature (T(ogη=3) and the liquidus temperature (Tliq) is at least<br>
+10°C. Preferably, the difference is at least +30°C and advantageously at least<br>
+60°C.<br>
Furthermore, the forming temperature is at most 1320°C and is<br>
preferably 1300°C or below, this corresponding to a temperature that is very<br>
acceptable as it does not require the glass to be excessively heated and makes<br>
it possible to minimize bushing wear.<br>
The preferred glass composition according to the invention comprises<br>
the following constituents (in mol%):<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
the composition furthermore containing less than 1% of impurities (AI2O3,<br>
Fe2O3, Cr2O3 and P2O5) and being free of F, TiO2, MgO, SrO and BaO.<br>
The particularly preferred glass composition according to the invention<br>
comprises the following constituents (in mol%):<br>
 <br>
the composition furthermore containing less than 1% of impurities (AI2O3,<br>
Fe2O3, Cr2O3 and P2O5) and being free of F, TiO2, MgO, SrO and BaO.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the CaO content in the<br>
glass composition varies from 3 to 8.5%.<br>
SiO2 is the oxide that forms the network of the glass according to the<br>
invention and plays an essential role in stabilizing it. Within the context of the<br>
invention, when the SiO2 content is less than 67%, the viscosity of the glass<br>
becomes too low and there is a greater risk of the glass devitrifying during<br>
fiberizing. In general, the SiO2 content is kept at 72% or below, as above this<br>
value the glass becomes too viscous and difficult to melt. Preferably, the SiO2<br>
content varies from 68 to 71.5%. Furthermore, SiO2 contributes to improving the<br>
resistance in a neutral or acid medium.<br>
ZrO2 is essential for giving the glass alkaline resistance, and its content<br>
is consequently at least about 5%, preferably 7.5% or higher. Furthermore, ZrO2<br>
helps to improve the acid resistance. A ZrO2 content greater than 9.5%<br>
increases the risk of devitrification during fiberizing and degrades the fusibility.<br>
Na2O, K2O and Li2O are used as fluxing agents to lower the viscosity of<br>
the glass and to allow better dissolution of the ZrO2 during the melting of the<br>
glass batch.<br>
Na2O has a deleterious effect on the hydrolytic resistance of the glass<br>
 <br>
and consequently its content is limited to a value of 10% or less, but preferably<br>
greater than 5%, again to maintain satisfactory melting and fiberizing conditions.<br>
The Li2O and K2O contents are preferably less than 5.5% so as to<br>
maintain an acceptable liquidus temperature and to minimize the cost of the<br>
glass (Li2O-based and K2O-based raw materials are generally carbonates,<br>
which are costly).<br>
A K2O content of greater than 2.5% is preferred.<br>
Preferably, the glass composition contains Li2O and K2O, thereby<br>
reducing the leaching of alkaline metals (Na, K and/or Li) when the glass is in<br>
contact with an aqueous medium. An advantageous level of leaching is<br>
obtained when the Li2O content is greater than 1.5%, preferably around 2%.<br>
According to one advantageous feature of the invention, the Li2O/R2O<br>
and K2O/R2O molar ratios are equal to 0.5 or less. Preferably, U2O/R2O is 0.35<br>
or less and K2O/R2O is 0.30 or less.<br>
According to the invention, the R2O content, that is to say the sum of<br>
the Na2O, K2O and Li2O contents, is 11% or more and preferably less than 17%<br>
so as to have satisfactory melting and fiberizing conditions.<br>
CaO allows the viscosity of the glass to be adjusted and the<br>
devitrification to be controlled. The CaO content varies between 3 and 9% so as<br>
to maintain an acceptable liquidus temperature, as a general rule below<br>
1280°C, preferably below 1260°C and advantageously 1220°C or below.<br>
Preferably, the CaO content is less than 8.5%. CaO contributes to improving the<br>
hydrolytic resistance of the glass compositions according to the invention.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention may contain up to 1%<br>
of unavoidable impurities introduced by the batch materials used to produce the<br>
glass and/or coming from the refractories of the furnace. The impurities consist<br>
of AI2O3, ion oxides (expressed in Fe2O3 form), Cr2O3, TiO2, MgO, SrO, BaO<br>
and P2O5. The AI2O3 content is generally less than 0.5%. Preferably, the Fe2O3<br>
content does not exceed 0.5% so as not to unacceptably impair the color of the<br>
glass strands and the operation of the fiberizing installation, in particular the<br>
heat transfer in the furnace. Also preferably, the Cr2O3 content is less than<br>
0.05% and better still it is zero. Advantageously, the content of each oxide,<br>
TiO2, MgO, SrO and BaO, is less than 0.5%.<br>
As a general rule, the glass composition contains no TiO2, MgO, SrO<br>
 <br>
and BaO.<br>
The glass composition is free of F. The presence of fluorine is<br>
proscribed because of the risk of polluting emissions and of an exothermic<br>
reaction with Li2O, which may occur during melting, and problems of the<br>
refractory elements of the furnace corroding.<br>
The glass strands are obtained from the glass composition described<br>
above using the following fiberizing process: a multiplicity of molten glass<br>
streams, flowing out from a multiplicity of holes placed in the base of one or<br>
more bushings, are attenuated in the form of one or more sheets of continuous<br>
filaments and then the filaments are gathered together into one or more strands<br>
that are collected on a moving support. This may be a rotating support when the<br>
strands are collected in the form of wound packages, or in the form of a support<br>
that moves translationally when the strands are chopped by a device that also<br>
serves to draw them or when the strands are sprayed by a device serving to<br>
draw them, so as to form a mat.<br>
The strands obtained, optionally after further conversion operations,<br>
may thus be in various forms: continuous strands, chopped strands, woven<br>
fabrics, knitted fabrics, braids, tapes or mats, these strands being composed of<br>
filaments having a diameter that may range from about 5 to 30 microns.<br>
The molten glass feeding the bushings is obtained from pure raw<br>
materials or, more usually, natural raw materials (that is to say possibly<br>
containing trace impurities), these raw materials being mixed in appropriate<br>
proportions, and then melted. The temperature of the molten glass is<br>
conventionally regulated so as to allow the glass to be fiberized and to avoid<br>
devitrification problems. Before the filaments are combined in the form of<br>
strands, they are generally coated with a size composition with the aim of<br>
protecting them from abrasion and allowing them to be subsequently<br>
incorporated into the materials to be reinforced. The size composition may be<br>
an aqueous or anhydrous composition (containing less than 5% solvent by<br>
weight), for example the composition described in WO 01/90017 A and<br>
FR 2837818 A. Where appropriate, before and/or after collection, the strands<br>
may undergo a heat treatment for the purpose of drying them and/or of curing<br>
the size.<br>
The glass strands obtained may thus be used to reinforce inorganic<br>
 <br>
materials, such as cementitious materials, and organic materials, particularly<br>
plastics.<br>
The inorganic materials that can be reinforced are especially<br>
cementitious materials, such as cement, concrete, mortar, gypsum, slag and<br>
compounds formed by the reaction between lime, silica and water, and mixtures<br>
of these materials with other materials, for example mixtures of cement,<br>
polymers and fillers (coatings).<br>
The reinforcement may be carried out directly by incorporating the glass<br>
strands into the cementitious material, or indirectly using glass strands<br>
combined beforehand with an organic material, for example to form composite<br>
elements that can be used as rebars for reinforced concrete.<br>
The organic materials that can be reinforced by the glass strands<br>
according to the invention are thermoplastics or thermosets, preferably<br>
thermosets.<br>
As examples of thermoplastics, mention may be made of polyolefins,<br>
such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polybutylene, polyesters, such as<br>
polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, polyamides,<br>
polyurethanes and blends of these compounds.<br>
As examples of thermosets, mention may be made of polyesters, for<br>
example vinyl ester resins, phenolic resins, epoxy resins, polyacrylics and<br>
blends of these compounds. Vinyl ester resins, particularly of the isophthalic<br>
type are preferred as they have better corrosion resistance.<br>
As already indicated above, it is possible to use the glass strands in the<br>
form of continuous strands (for example in the form of cakes or rovings,<br>
meshes, fabrics, etc.) or chopped strands (for example in the form of<br>
nonwovens, such as veils or mats), and their presentation depends on the<br>
nature of the material to be reinforced and on the process employed.<br>
Continuous glass strands according to the invention may thus be used<br>
for manufacture of hollow bodies, such as pipes or tanks using the known<br>
technique of filament winding, which consists in depositing a reinforcement, for<br>
example a layer of roving impregnated with organic material, on a mandrel<br>
rotating about its axis. Such hollow bodies are intended in particular for<br>
collecting and discharging wastewater (as pipes) and for storing or transporting<br>
chemicals (as tanks and containers). As regards chopped strands, these are<br>
 <br>
suitable for reinforcing paints or mastics and for producing composites by<br>
contact molding.<br>
Wound packages of strands may be used for producing meshes or<br>
fabrics used as crack-resistant or earthquake-resistant elements in cementitious<br>
materials, or for repairing civil engineering works (bridges, tunnels, roads, etc.).<br>
The packages may also be used for manufacturing composite sections by<br>
pultrusion, that is to say by passing a reinforcement impregnated with organic<br>
material through a heated die. These composite sections are used in particular<br>
as construction elements in industries where the materials must have a high<br>
resistance to alkalis and acids, for example in the chemical, oil and harbor<br>
industries.<br>
The glass strands are generally incorporated into the inorganic or<br>
organic material to be reinforced in an amount such that the glass represents 15<br>
to 80% by volume, preferably 20 to 60% by volume, of the final material.<br>
In the final composite, the glass strands may be the only elements for<br>
reinforcing the inorganic or organic material, or they may be combined with<br>
other elements, such as metal wires and/or mineral, especial ceramic, strands.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention makes it possible to<br>
produce glass strands having a better hydrolytic resistance than the known<br>
strands for reinforcing organic or inorganic materials, and can be inexpensively<br>
fiberized in conventional installations without the operating conditions being<br>
modified.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that these glass strands exhibit good<br>
dielectric properties, especially a dielectric constant ε" of less than 8 at 1 MHz<br>
and less than 6.5 at 10 GHz, and dielectric losses s" of less than 0.0500 at<br>
1 MHz and less than 0.1250 at 10 GHz.<br>
The examples that follow allow the invention to be illustrated without<br>
however limiting it.<br>
a) production of the glass<br>
Glass was prepared by melting the compositions given in Table 1,<br>
expressed in mol%.<br>
The density, Young's modulus, dielectric constant e' and dielectric<br>
losses e" at 1 MHz and 10 GHz (Table 1) were measured on this glass when<br>
 <br>
cut and polished.<br>
b) production of the strands<br>
Glass strands 10 urn in diameter were formed by attenuating molten<br>
glass streams obtained under a) flowing from a platinum bushing and collected<br>
in the form of a bobbin.<br>
The hydrolytic resistance was measured on the glass strand under the<br>
following conditions: 60 mg of strand extracted from the above bobbin were<br>
placed in a container holding 9 ml of uitrapure water, the container was then<br>
hermetically sealed and placed in a bath thermostated at 80°C for 48 hours.<br>
The test was carried out on five specimens of the same strand. At the same<br>
time, three controls each containing only 9 ml of uitrapure water were produced.<br>
The content of the five specimens containing the glass strand (solution<br>
S1) and of the three controls (solution S2) were collected and the amount of<br>
alkali metal elements in the solutions was measured by inductively coupled<br>
plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy in the case of Na and K and by atomic<br>
emission spectroscopy (AES) in the case of Li. The resulting alkali metal <br>
content due to leaching from the glass (corresponding to the difference in <br>
contents in S1 and S2), expressed in mol/m3, is given inTable 1 below.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Examples 1 to 9 are in accordance with the invention.<br>
Examples 10 to 15 are comparative examples:<br>
-	the glasses of examples 10, 11 and 13 contain a high proportion of<br>
Na2O, K2O and Li2O respectively: these glasses cannot be fiberized under the<br>
usual fiberizing conditions because they have a (Tlogn=3 - Tliq) value that is zero<br>
or negative;<br>
-	the glass of example 12 contains a high proportion of Na2O: it can be<br>
fiberized, especially because it has a suitable K2O content and a suitable CaO<br>
content, but the strands obtained have a low hydrolytic resistance; and<br>
-	examples 14 and 15 correspond to compositions of cement-reinforcing<br>
glass strands sold by Saint-Gobain Vetrotex under the name Cem-FIL® and by<br>
NEG under the name ARG® respectively. The hydrolytic resistance of these<br>
strands remains limited.<br>
The glass strands according to the invention (examples 1 to 9) exhibit<br>
excellent hydrolytic resistance compared with the glass strands having a high<br>
Na2O content (example 12) and compared with commercial strands (examples<br>
14 and 15). This is because the observed diffusion of Na+ ions into the aqueous<br>
medium is less than with the known strands: the reduction is equal to 38% and<br>
45% in the case of the least resistant strands (example 5 compared with<br>
examples 15 and 14, respectively) and is equal to 83% and 85% in the case of<br>
the most resistant strands (example 8 compared with examples 15 and 14,<br>
respectively).<br>
c) production of the composites<br>
Strands composed of 17 urn diameter glass filaments were obtained by<br>
attenuating molten glass streams of composition according to examples 1, 4<br>
and 14 and collected in the form of wound packages. Along their path, the<br>
filaments were coated with a conventional aqueous size A (as described in<br>
comparative example 2 of FR 2 837 818 A) or with a size B suitable for<br>
corrosive media (as described in example 1 of FR 2 837 818 A) before being<br>
collected into strands containing 400 filaments. The wound packages were<br>
dried at 130°C for 12 hours.<br>
The glass strands were used to form composite sheets containing<br>
parallel strands in accordance with the ISO 1268-5 standard. The reinforced<br>
resin was an isophthalic polyester resin (reference "Synolite 1717" sold by<br>
 <br>
DSM) to which 1.5 parts of hardener (reference "Trigonox HM", sold by Akzo)<br>
per 100 parts of resin by weight were added.<br>
Each sheet contained 50% glass by volume and had a thickness of<br>
3	mm. The sheets were then treated at 80°C for 2 hours and then at 120°C for<br>
4	hours in order to accomplish complete crosslinking of the resin.<br>
The following properties were determined on the sheets:<br>
-	the Young's modulus according to the ISO 14125 standard and the<br>
Young's modulus of the glass strand Mstand was calculated using the equation:<br>
in which: <br>
Msheet is the Young's modulus of the strand composite sheet, in MPa;<br>
Mresin is the Young's modulus of the resin, in MPa;<br>
Vresin is the volume fraction of the resin in the sheet; and<br>
VFglass is the volume fraction of the glass in the sheet.<br>
-	hydrolytic resistance<br>
The sheet was placed in a both of boiling water for 72 hours and, at<br>
regular intervals, removed from the bath, drained and weighed. The water<br>
uptake of the composite sheet is equal to the percentage of water absorbed by<br>
this same sheet over a time interval divided by the square root of the time<br>
interval, expressed in hours.<br>
-	acid resistance<br>
The sheets were protected at the edges by a layer of epoxy resin 1 to<br>
2 mm in thickness and then each sheet was placed under a given constant<br>
stress, in three-point bending, in an acid solution (1N HCI at 25°C). The failure<br>
time of the composite under the flexural stress conditions (ISO 14125 standard)<br>
was measured and the curve of the flexural fracture strength as a function of<br>
time plotted. The value of the SC (Stress Corrosion) stress in bending, in MPa,<br>
needed to make the composite fail after 100 hours of aging was determined<br>
from this curve.<br>
The measured values of the tensile strength and the Young's modulus<br>
of the glass strand, and also the hydrolytic resistance and acid resistance, of<br>
the composite are given in Table 2 below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The strands according to the invention (examples 16 and 17) coated with size A<br>
have a higher tensile strength than the commercial strands (example 18), but<br>
this remains below that of the E-glass strands (example 19). The Young's<br>
modulus of these strands is higher than the strands of examples 18 and 19.<br>
The composite sheet containing these strands also has a better resistance in<br>
acid media than that containing E-glass strands (example 19).<br>
The same strands coated with size B (examples 20 and 21) have a tensile<br>
strength equivalent to and a Young's modulus greater than those of the known<br>
strands (example 22).<br>
The composite sheets containing the strands according to the invention exhibit<br>
better resistance to aqueous and acid media: the water uptake is reduced and<br>
the SC stress is improved compared with those obtained with the strands of<br>
example 22.<br>
 <br>
