The features of the invention, and its technical advantages, can be seen from the following description of the preferred embodiments together with the claims and the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	illustrates an exemplary drive system, and<br>
Fig. 2	is a cross-sectional view of one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the belt of the present invention taken along the line 2-2 in<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides a low modulus drive belt for an automotive, multiple-pulley accessory drive system that allows for relatively high elongation during installation and that maintains a relatively high percentage of its install tension throughout the useful life of the belt. The present invention also provides an automotive, multiple-pulley accessory drive system that utilizes such a belt and provides a method for constructing such a bell.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an example of a rear-end accessory drive system 10 for use in an automobile includes a drive pulley 12 driven by the automobile's engine and an accessory pulley 14 operatively coupled to the drive shaft of the accessory component, such as the water pump of the automobile. A drive belt 16 is engaged between the pulleys<br><br>
12,14 to transfer rotational force from the drive pulley 12 to the accessory pulley 14. In an exemplary embodiment, the relative maximum speed for this accessory drive system is approximately 3400 rpm with a relative maximum torque of approximately 27 N-m (2 ft-lbs). Accordingly, in this exemplary embodiment, the belt 16 for use with this drive maintains a drive tension of at least approximately 89 N (20 Ibf.) and has an install tension of at most approximately 445 N (100 IbO. It will be appreciated that, while the accessory drive system of the exemplary embodiment includes only two pulleys, it is within the scope of the invention that the accessory drive system include more than two pulleys.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2. the exemplary embodiment of the belt 16 is a multi-layer composite structure that includes an outer, cover layer 18 of friction fabric material or rubber material bonded to a layer 20 of cushion rubber material, which is bonded to an inner layer 22 of wear-resistant material.   The layer 20 of cushion rubber material, in the exemplary embodiment, includes a plurality of axially aligned, polyamide 6.6 twisted cords 23 extending longitudinally therethrough.  The inner layer 22  of wear-resistant  rubber material  is,   in  the  exemplary embodiment, an EPDM compound selected according to environmental and performance factors that is impregnated with reinforcing fibers. Such a fiber-impregnated compound is shown, for example, in U.S. Pat Nos. 5.267.908 and 5,518,460 (see also, U.S. pal. Nos. 5,273.496; 5.334,107; 5.507,699).   Additionally, in the exemplary embodiment, the cushion matenal in the layer 20 is an elastomeric compound compatible for curing with, and around, the cords 23 and compatible for bonding to the inner layer 22 of wear-resistant rubber material. Additionally, in the exemplary embodiment, the polyamide 6.6 twisted cords 23 are comprised of a pair of 6.6 polyamide yam strands twisted together, where the finished cord<br><br>
has a diameter of approximately 0,58 mm (0.023 in.). Such a construction is commonly referred to by those of ordinary skill in the art as a "840/1/2" cord construction (denier/yarns-per-ply/plies-per-cord). It will be appreciated to those of ordinary skill in the art that alternate arrangements of the 6,6 polyamide yarn strands can be used to create alternate constructions of the twisted cords that include, but are not limited to, 840/1/3, 1000/1/2, 660/1/3. etc.<br>
Finally, in certain embodiments, the axial or lateral spacing between the edges of adjacent polyamide 6.6 twisted cords is approximately 0.3 mm (0,012 in), which amounts to about 12 cords per cm or 30 cords per inch, to approximately 0.4 mm (0.016 in), which amounts to about 10 cords per cm or 26 cords per inch; in the exemplary embodiment, the spacing is approximately 0.3 mm (0.012 in).<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the drive belt 16 is a poly-ribbed belt since it includes a plurality of longitudinal grooves 24 cut into the inner surface of the belt, forming a complementary plurality of ribs 26, where such ribs and grooves 24, 26 are received within corresponding ribs 28 and grooves 30 on the pulleys 12,14.<br>
Before installation on the accessory drive 10, in certain embodiments, the length of the belt 16 is approximately 2% to approximately 3% lower than the nominal drive length between the drive pulley 12 and accessory pulley 14 (where the nofninal drive length is the length of a taut belt when carried on the drive pulley and accessory pulley; or, if more than two pulleys are used in the accessory drive system, the nominal drive length is the length of a taut belt when carried on all the pulleys of the accessory drive system). In the exemplary embodiment, the length of the drive belt 16, before installation on the pulleys, is approximately 2.2% to approximately 2.3% lower than the<br><br>
nominal drive length between the drive pulley 12 and the accessory pulley 14. Such a reduced length of the drive bell 16. in combination with the construction of the drive belt 16 as discussed herein, provides the drive belt with an operational drive tension of approximately 111 N (25lbfO to approximately 200 N (45 Ibf.) over the operational life of the belt 16, which, for a three-ribbed belt, is typically 241.401 Km (150.000 miles) of operation for the automobile on which the belt 16 is used. Operational life will change for other configurations of the bell, e.g, 6-rib belt configurations.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the belts 16 are produced utilizing a novel version of the fabrication method commonly known as the "flycut" method. This involves the application of a cover layer of bias cut friction fabric (woven, non-woven, knit, etc.) or rubber material to an outer surface of a cylindrical drum; applying a layer of cushion stock rubber over the layer of friction fabric on the drum; spinning the polyamide 6.6 twisted cords around the drum at a predetermined spacing and tension, applying an optional second layer of the cushion stock rubber around the cords spun over the first layer of cushion slock rubber, applying a layer of relatively strong and wear-resistant fiber loaded, rubber material to the drum over the second layer of cushion slock (or over the wound cords if no optional second layer of cushion stock is used), curing the layers wrapped on the drum (using high-pressure steam, for example) such thai the layers of cushion slock rubber material flow around the polyamide 6.6 twisted cords and bond to the cover layer of bias-cut friction fabric and to the layer of strong and wear-resistant, fiber loaded, rubber material. Once cured, the composite layers are removed from the curing area or vessel (high-pressure steam) and cooled to stop the curing process. Next, the tubular sleeve of cured composite material is cut into the<br><br>
individual bells and the belts are taken to a profiling machine so that the grooves can be cut into the outer surface of the belts. Once the grooves are cut the belts may be turned inside out for use on the accessory drive system.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment the polyamide 6.6 twisted cords are wound over the first layer of cushion stock rubber at a cord spinning tension of approximately 15.5 N (3.5 Ibf.). Additionally, as discussed above, iri the exemplary embodiment, the winds of the cord are spaced at a distance of approximately 0.30 mm {0.012 in).<br>
The above process is merely an exemplary process for constructing an exemplary belt according to the present invention. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that alternate combinations of layers, material and steps may be used and still remain within the scope of at least certain aspects of the present invention. For example, both layers of cushion stock rubber may be eliminated if the wear-resistant, fiber loaded, rubber material can be cured to flow around the cords and bond to the cover layer. It will also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the grooves may be formed into the belt using other methods, such as grinding or molding.<br>
The belt 16 of the present invention provides a tensile modulus of, in a number of embodiments, at least approximately 7000 N/mm/mm (1572 Ibf/in/in); and in more detailed embodiments, approximately 7800 Wmm/mm (1750 Ibf/in/in) to approximately 8500 N/mm/mm (1910 Ibf/in/in); and in the exemplary embodiment, approximately 8500 N/mm/mm (1910 Ibf/in/in). Therefore, the belt according to the exemplary embodiment is a low modulus belt with a relatively high elongation throughout the installation range. The belt of the exemplary embodiment has been found to maintain a relatively high<br><br>
percentage of its install tension (approximately 40% to approximately 60% of its install tension) throughout the life of the belt, in both cold "non-operating" conditions and in hot "operating" conditions. Such a belt is specifically capable of being installed over the pulleys of the accessory drive by "stretching" the belt over the pulleys; and additionally, the belt is specifically designed to maintain a desired tension throughout the design life of the drive. Because the belt has a relatively low tensile modulus, the tensile force at installation is greatly reduced as compared to conventional belts of this type.<br>
Following from the above description summaries, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that, while the apparatus and processes herein described constitute exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to these precise apparatuses and processes and that changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. Additionally, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the claims and it is not intended that any limitations or element<br>
describing the exemplary embodiments herein are to be incorporated into the meanings of the claims unless such limitations or elements are specifically listed in the claims. Likewise, it is to be understood that it is not necessary to meet any or all of the identified advantages or objects of the present invention disclosed herein in order to fall within the scope of any claim, since the invention is defined by the claims and since inherent and/or unforeseen advantages of the present invention may exist though they may not be explicitly discussed herein.<br><br><br><br>
