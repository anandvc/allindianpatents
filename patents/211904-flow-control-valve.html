Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to Flow Control Valve. This invention pertains to the regulation of the distribution of protected drinking water supply in the Corporation, Municipality and Town Panchayat.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
In the present Government Water Supply mode, using the ferrule Cock to the individual customer from the main source does the regulation of water supply.<br>
However, this scheme docs not fulfill its purpose well as envisaged by the Govt, as the consumer is at ease to draw extra water than the stipulated by using suction electric motor or pump over the ferrule cock. Hence, the Govt, scheme is not only violated in distribution of water but also results in loss to the local authorities.<br>
The Primary object of this invention is to eradicate the defects of the existing system and to develop a fool-proof device for the equal water distribution, which not only allows the stipulated rate of flow or prevents the illegal tapping of water but also stops the return flow from the sewage, which is a major problem for the society in contamination of drinking water. It is also the object of the invention to have device, which is very simple in construction, easy for operation and available at affordable cost.<br>
According to the above, the Apparatus for controlling and regulating the flow of drinking Water in Public drinking water distribution system through pipe lines, that is actuated by Ball Drive Flow Control System at the predetermined pressures; comprising, an external main body, main flow path having a ball within the said body to regulate and control the predetermined quantity of water; said main flow path having an Inlet and Outlet for flow of water, through the Inlet the flow lifts the ball at the main flow path; water flows through the specified flow path inside the body wherein ball is moved by upstream pressure according to variable pressure rate and controls the discharge of water to the designed flow rate through the outlet; said outlet be closed by the ball and water supply get stopped when the Pressure exceeds than the predetermined pressures.<br>
Now the invention will be more clearly described with the figures of the drawings which accompany the complete specification.<br>
The Valve has a body (1) made up of metal such as Brass, Stainless Steel metal. The inlet (2) is provided at the bottom of the valve. The ball (3) within the flow path could be driven by the flow through the flow path(4). The flow path is defined with the inlet and outlet as its two ends(2 fit 5). The outlet is at the top of the valve from where distribution pipe is fitted.<br><br>
Fig 1 of the accompanying drawing shows the layout diagram of the Flow Control Valve.<br>
The Flow Control Valve has the following main components:<br>
l.The Exterior Metallic Body<br>
2. Inlet<br>
3.Ball<br>
4.Ball Drive Flow Path<br>
5.Outlet<br>
The Flow Control Valve is to be kept vertical position. The ball (3) within normally rests at the bottom of the flow path closing over the inlet.<br>
The following drawings shows another embodiment wherein the position of the ball under different working condition is illustrated.<br>
Fig. 2 of the drawing shows the first working condition at minimum operating pressiire 0.01 kgf (10cm Head). It is seen from the drawings that the Ball is lifted up when flow enters in to the flow control valve.<br>
Fig. 3 of the drawing shows the working condition of the control valve wherein the ball is nearly in the middle of the flow path. The normal operating pressure at this condition is around 3.0 m Head to 6.0 m Head. It is to be noted that the Ball floats at appropriate levels to allow the designed quantity of water.<br>
Fig, 4 of the drawings shows the 3rd working condition wherein the ball is closed at the outlet of the flow control valve at this working condition, the pressure level will be 6.0 m Head and above. This condition is comparable to a situation of using electric suction motor. Here the flow is stopped by the ball stress over the outlet hole and the consumer get no water when using electric motor illegally.<br>
Fig. 5 Shows that fourth working condition of flow control valve wherein the device has to function.<br>
a)	It controls return flow from household when distribution is closed.<br>
b)	Functions as a non return valve.<br>
The design of the valve is based on the quantity of water (in litres) in accordance with the flow per minute in the distribution of water to each household eventually. The valve fitted will not supply the water beyond the specified water flow (per minute). The water supply fixed by the Govt, for each household will be distributed equally. Not above all, the Plumbers or Fitters can increase the water flow under the influence of selfish persons.<br>
Salient feature of the invention is that if the flow rate of supply exceeds, the ball is stressed beyond and thereby closes the outlet, the water supply get stopped. If the water is sucked with the electrical motor, water flow increase leads to blocking the outlet.<br><br>
As soon as the water supply is stopped by the local bodies the valve closes automatically and water or air will not go back to the main pipe. Water Meter works due to the air flow both forward and backward and so when the water supply is stopped the airflow from the household is let in with the result the meter runs opposite direction and so the account of the quantity supplied would differ. The valve will cease the water meter to work in opposite direction.<br>
Where there is low supply of water, a pit inside the house is made for storing and use. Hence, the tank is filled during the water supply. Afterwards, water goes into the main pipe when the water supply is ceased. Water inside the house tank may or may not be contaminated. The contaminated water from any house hold may go to the main pipe and when the water supply is given again, the chance of contaminated water going to different houses, is more. This leads to health hazard to the public. The valve arrests this type of water pollution.<br>
Besides domestic water supply is normally linked to household parallel to drainage below to the ground level. The polluted water due to cleaning of utensils around the street tap goes to different area when the water supply in resumed. Again the contaminated water leads to health hazard in that area. The complaints of polluted water are on the increase in almost all the places in the country, with the induction of the valve water getting polluted is cent percent avoided.<br>
The water supply under the control of the staff of local bodies is taken care of, if they try to abuse water supply.<br>
Water supply at both low and high level areas will be maintained equally due to the induction of the valve.<br>
Advantages ;<br>
1.	The device will permit draw of water supply at and below the specified rate<br>
of flow.<br>
2,	The device will not permit the draw of water supply at a higher rate by using any device like suction motor, etc.<br>
3,	The Flow Control Valve does not permit any return of flow thereby ensures the consumer and prevents contaminated sewage into the main for the entire distribution system.<br>
4,	Water supply at both low and high level areas will be maintained equally due to the induction of the valve.<br><br>
5.	The flow control valve, is a simple device and easy for construction, at affordable cost,<br>
6.	The invention is useful not only for water distribution but also for any other<br>
fluid in similar application.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
