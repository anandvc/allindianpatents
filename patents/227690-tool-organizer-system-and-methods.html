				<td>1. Technical Field<br>
This invention generally relates to a tool storage and organization devices, and<br>
specifically to a storage and organization device that enables a user to selectively<br>
group and position tools on a mounting board.<br>
2. State of the Art<br>
Tool storage devices of the past include tool boxes and peg boards. Tool<br>
boxes have trays and drawers for organizing tools. Some tool boxes are large and<br>
form cabinets. Some tool cabinets also include peg boards. However, tool boxes and<br>
tool cabinets have lids or doors enclosing the tools. Rirthermore, the drawers and<br>
compartments are typically stacked in a compact arrangement<br>
Peg boards, whether in combination with tool boxes or not, typically have a<br>
repeating pattern of holes or other mounting structure. The repeating pattern of holes<br>
or other structure provides incremental positions at which objects can be supported.<br>
Pegs are typically inserted in the holes or the other mounting structure provides<br>
protrusions for engaging tools. Thus, the tools are typically supported at positions that<br>
can be incrementally adjusted to discrete positions corresponding to the repeating<br>
pattern of holes or other mounting structure.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tool storage and organization device that<br>
enables a user to selectively group and position tools on a mounting board. The peg<br>
boards and other storage devices of the past are deficient, on the other hand, because<br>
they limit the orientations of stored tools and the position of the tools on a support<br>
substrate. This is because the peg board holes and other mounting structures on the<br>
support substrates of past devices generally have an incremental or repeating pattern.<br>
For example, when a peg board has pre-drilled holes disposed at one inch increments,<br>
the tools supported on the peg board are located at discrete positions corresponding to<br>
the holes. This is because pegs are limited to being supported in pre-drilled holes. If<br>
&amp; user wants to move the mounting pegs closer together or wants to group the tools by<br>
tool type, he or she is generally limited to the positions provided by the locations of<br>
the pre-drilled holes or the other incremental mounting structure.<br>
Even in past devices in which a continuous strip of magnetic, hook, or loop<br>
material is attached to the support substrate, the tools are limited to mounting in<br>
positions that have been predetermined by the placement of the strip of material.<br>
The past devices are also deficient in providing a very durable hard finish to a<br>
peg board Normally, peg boards are formed of a pressed board material and the holes<br>
for the pegs are drilled through the press board. A relatively non-durable paint may be<br>
applied to one surface of the peg board. Therefore, the peg boards of the past are<br>
vulnerable to marring during storing and retrieving of tools.<br>
The tool boxes and cabinets of the past enclose tools that are stored therein.<br>
Even if the doors and drawers arc left open, the compact nature of tool boxes and<br>
cabinets generally causes at least some of the tools in the boxes or cabinets to be<br>
layered and hidden from view. That is, the tool boxes and cabinets of the past are<br>
deficient because they generally require a user to open and close drawers and to dig<br>
for tools during their search for a particular tool.<br>
On the other hand, in a simple form, the present invention overcomes these<br>
deficiencies and inadequacies with a tool organizer system that has a flat sheet of<br>
magnetically attracted material that is not part of another support structure. The<br>
system includes at least one tool that has a magnet At least one position indicator is<br>
selectively placed on a front face of the fiat sheet. The position indicator has a shape<br>
and/or a size adapted to match the at least one tool The flat sheet forms a single<br>
substrate with a height, a width, and a thickness. The flat sheet has a property<br>
throughout the height, the width, and the thickness that together with the magnet holds<br>
the weight of the at least one tool on the front face of the sheet. Advantageously, the<br>
tool organizer system is structurally very simple with no element of the system that<br>
extends outside the height, the width, and the thickness and that has a property or a<br>
geometry for holding the weight of the at least one tool on the front face of the sheet<br>
The tool organizer system is generally for a plurality of tools and includes a<br>
plurality of position indicators. The tools can be formed from predecessor tools that<br>
have been modified by adding respective magnets. Alternatively or additionally, the<br>
tools can have embedded magnets that are integral with the tools. Importantly, the<br>
front face of the flat sheet is smooth and free of incremental holes or protrusions for<br>
mounting tools on the front face of the flat sheet. Thus, the position indicators and<br>
tools can be mounted without limitation to their positions and orientation.<br>
In one aspect, the tool organizer system includes hook and loop fasteners<br>
connecting at least some of the tools to the flat sheet to additionally mount the tools<br>
on the flat sheet Additionally or alternatively, the tool organizer system can have at<br>
least one additional tool with hook and loop fasteners connected to the at least one<br>
additional tool and to die flat sheet to mount the at least one additional tool on the flat<br>
sheet. Using hook and loop fasteners has the advantage of enabling mounting<br>
positions that are not limited to a particular position or orientation. However, the<br>
mounting position is established by the extra step of mounting one of hooks and loops<br>
on the support substrate, whereas using magnets and a magnetically attracted flat sheet<br>
provides unlimited positioning and orientation without the step of mounting a separate<br>
attachment mechanism to the support substrate. Furthermore, when using hook and<br>
loop fasteners, it is not easy to change the position of the attachment mechanism on<br>
the support substrate. Conversely, magnets and the magnetically attracted sheet<br>
permit changing the mounting position because the attachment mechanism is<br>
inherently provided throughout the sheet by nature of the material of the sheet.<br>
Furthermore, magnets and the magnetically attracted flat sheet have the added<br>
advantage of enabling twisting reorientation of the tools without the need to lift the<br>
tools from the flat sheet, m another aspect, the flat sheet is to be coated with a<br>
resistant finish for improved aesthetics and durability. This finish can be provided as<br>
a baked powder coating on a front face of the flat sheet.<br>
The tool organizer system includes an additional attachment mechanism that<br>
selectively mounts the flat sheet on a wall. This additional mounting mechanism can<br>
include any of a variety of conventional mounting devices. By way of example and<br>
not by way of limitation, the additional mounting mechanism can include through<br>
holes and screws, bolts, hooks, wire, brackets, adhesive, and/or magnets. In<br>
particular, the screws can be wood, plaster, brick, or concrete screws. Furthermore,<br>
the screws can be expansion screws for mounting the flat sheet on a plasterboard or<br>
cinder block wall.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention includes a tool set organizer system<br>
kit. The kit of the invention can include one or more of several components for<br>
packaging and distribution in accordance with customer requests. The components of<br>
such a kit can include a continuous flat sheet of magnetically attracted material that<br>
has a front face. Similar to the system described above, the front face does not have<br>
an incremental pattern of tool mounting structure. The kit may also include a set of<br>
position indicator decals adapted for placement on the flat sheet. The position<br>
indicator decals are also not incrementally limited. The kit may also include a set of<br>
tool magnets adapted to magnetically attach tools to the flat sheet. In at least some<br>
cases, the kit will include a set of tools. The set of magnets can be operatively<br>
connected to the tools or supplied separately for attachment to the tools by a user of<br>
the kit. The sets of tools, position indicator decals, and magnets can each be a set of<br>
greater than one.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the set of position indicators can include<br>
pictures of the tools in the set of tools to be stof ed. Such a set can be provided in a kit<br>
of the invention. Furthermore, the kit can include hook and loop fasteners adapted to<br>
additionally or alternatively mount the tools of the set of tools to the flat sheet. The<br>
kit can also include fasteners adapted to mount the flat sheet on a wall. Additionally,<br>
die kit can further include one or more pictures adapted for placement at any position<br>
on the front face of the flat sheet<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention includes a method of storing and<br>
organizing tools. The method can include mounting on a wall, an unenclosed flat<br>
sheet comprising a front face having magnetically attracted material. The method also<br>
includes selecting a tool mounting position in an area including substantially all of the<br>
front face of the flat sheet In this step, the tool mounting position will not be limited<br>
to incremental positions. A position indicator is placed at the tool mounting position.<br>
Of course, when there are a plurality of tools to be stored, a plurality of tool<br>
mounting positions not limited to incremental positions are selected and position<br>
indicators are placed at these positions. The method of storing and organizing can<br>
alternatively or additionally include adhering a magnet or one of a hook and loop<br>
fastener to the flat sheet for connection with a complimentary portion of a fastening<br>
mechanism that resides on a tool, for example.<br>
In one aspect, the method of storing and organizing includes the step of<br>
matching the tools with respective position indicating deeals that uniquely<br>
corresponds to the tools. In another aspect, the method includes storing the tools by<br>
magnetically attracting the tools to the flat sheet at any position on die front face. The<br>
tools need not be limited to the tool mounting positions or any incremental positions.<br>
In still another aspect of the method of storing and organizing, storing the tools<br>
includes magnetically attracting at least some of the tools to the flat sheet while<br>
additionally or alternatively attaching at least some tools to the flat sheet by hook and<br>
loop fasteners.<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention iacludes a method of making a<br>
tool organizer. This method can include feceiviflg a request for at least one of a base<br>
color and/or texture, a picture to be displayed on the tool organizer, and a set of<br>
position indicators based on tools to be organized. The method of making the tool<br>
organizer can include forming the organizer of an unsupported, unenclosed, flat sheet<br>
of magnetically attracted material. The method of making CM also include forming<br>
the organizer to have no incremental holes or protruding structure for supporting tools<br>
on a front face of the flat sheet The method of making also includes providing at<br>
least one of the base color or texture, the picture, and the set of position indicators in<br>
accordance with the customer request. In one aspect, the step of receiving a request<br>
includes receiving a customer request over the Internet<br>
In another aspect, the method of making the tool organizer can include<br>
receiving a request for a set of tools including a particular brand. The step of<br>
providing in this case includes providing the set of tools and the set of position<br>
indicators including at least one of a particular shape, size, or color, corresponding to<br>
the particular brand. On the other hand, if the requestor already has a set of tools, he<br>
or she will simply want to match the tools that he or she has. Therefore, receiving a<br>
request includes receiving a request for matching the system with a set of tools, which<br>
may include a particular brand.<br>
In still another aspect, the method of making the tool organizer includes<br>
providing the set of position indicators as full-size color pictures of tools of the set of<br>
tools. The method of making the tool organizer can also include receiving a request<br>
for one or more of a plurality of predetermined pictures displayed on a web site<br>
configured for Internet orders. Alternatively or additionally, the method of making<br>
can include a request for a picture, a copy of which is included in digital form together<br>
with the request over the Internet.<br>
When the method of making a tool organizer includes a request for a, base<br>
color and/or texture, the step of providing can be accomplished by electrostatically<br>
coating the flat sheet with a powder comprising a requested color and/or texture.<br>
Then the flat sheet and coating is baked at temperatures in a range from 375 degrees F<br>
to 400 degrees F to form a very hard, durable, yet aesthetic flat sheet.<br>
The foregoing and other features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
be apparent from the following more detailed description of the particular<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
As discussed above, embodiments of the present invention relate to a tool<br>
organizer system 10 for storing and organizing a set of tools of which tools 12,14,16,<br>
18,20 are examples. As shown in Figure 1, the system 10 includes a flat sheet 25 of<br>
magnetically attracted material. This material typically is made of a sheet of metal,<br>
such as ferrous metal. However, the thin sheet 25 could also comprise a composite<br>
with metal material dispersed in the sheet or a lamination with a thin magnetically<br>
attracted sheet in a front position among the laminants. The flat sheet of material<br>
includes a front face 30 for supporting the tools 12,14,16,18,20. A position<br>
indicator as shown at 35 is provided for each of the tools to be supported on the front<br>
face 30. These position indicators 35 can take any of many forms. By way of<br>
example and not by way of limitation, the position indicators 35 can include adhesive<br>
backed decals. Other ways of providing the position indicators 35 include painting<br>
such as by stencils, or by attaching silhouette or cutouts substrates in the form of the<br>
respective tool.<br>
In a broad sense, the position indicators 35 could take the form of color coded<br>
marks or shapes that correspond to colors applied to th&amp; tools. Furthermore, position<br>
indicators in the form of markers having shapes associated with particular tools could<br>
be used as position indicators. Further alternatively, shapes that are not associated<br>
with a particular tool or its function, but which are distinct from one another could be<br>
applied to the tool and a position at which a respective tool would be mounted on the<br>
face 30. In a particularly attractive embodiment, the position indicators 35 comprise a<br>
full sized color picture of each tool fa be mounted on the face 30. In this way,<br>
confusion can be avoided and a comparison will bear out which tool is to be mounted<br>
in a particular location. With digital photo technologies, position indicator decals<br>
comprising full sized color pictures can be made and printed on sticky back decals<br>
substrates. Alternatively, similar images can be placed on plastic or vinyl sheets that<br>
can be easily pealed off and put back on a surface without a distinct adhesive layer or<br>
backing. This would have the advantages of removal and replacement without leaving<br>
a sticky or resinous residue, and decals formed in this way would be capable of<br>
repeated removal and replacement without loss of adhesive capability. Such decals<br>
include but may not be limited to those that adhere by static cling to most smooth<br>
surfaces.<br>
Similar to the position indicator decals 35 additional pictures 40 can be<br>
provided in a similar manner. Such pictures could include advertisements,<br>
trademark(s) or pictures for decoration purposes. Pictures 40 can include flags, logos,<br>
or emblems for a sports team or other organization that provides a sense of identity for<br>
a particular user. The picture 40 can be provided as a decal or can be painted during<br>
manufacturing. The picture 40 may be an advertisement and include an illustration of<br>
a particular product such as an automobile part, for example.<br>
Advantageously, the position indicator decals 35 and the picture 40 can be<br>
located at any position on the entire surface of front face 30 of the flat sheet 25. hi<br>
this way, tools can also be positioned at any location on the front face 30 of the flat<br>
sheet 25 without covering the picture 40. Alternatively, the tools can be positioned in<br>
overlying relation to the picture 40. As shown in Figure 1, the tools may be grouped<br>
together with other like tools for convenience and organization. Since the entire<br>
metallic sheet 25 comprises magnetically attracted material, positioning of the tools is<br>
not limited to specific incremental positions on the front race 30. Likewise, the<br>
position indicators 35 can be located at any position on the front face 30. As shown in<br>
Figure 1, some of the tools are positioned in closely abutting relation to each other.<br>
The capability of the organizing system to enable positioning of the tools in closely<br>
abutting relation and in any orientation has great space saving advantages. This<br>
feature also allows subsets such as bit and grinder sets 45,50 to be attached at<br>
convenient locations on the front face 30. These advantages are not achieved by peg<br>
boards which, for example, would require mounting of the tools and the bit sets at<br>
specific locations limited by the incremental attachment structure of such peg boards.<br>
Furthermore, the flat sheet 25 of the system can be conveniently mounted to a wall 52<br>
by way of fasteners 55 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows a kit 60 of a tool set organizer system in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The kit includes the flat sheet 25 mat can be coated with a durable<br>
hard material providing at least a front face 30 with an aesthetic appearance. The<br>
coating can be made smooth as shown in Figure 1 or can be textured as shown at 62 in<br>
Figure 2. A roughened or textured coating can provide the advantage of a frictional<br>
engagement by tools being held on the flat sheet. The kit also includes position<br>
indicators such as decal 64 to be placed on the flat sheet 25, The position indicators<br>
can be placed on the flat sheet 25 by a user's or a manufacturer's hand 68.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, position indicators could be painted on or otherwise<br>
provided during manufacturing. In this case, the kit may be provided without position<br>
indicators. The picture 40 can be included with the kit 60. In one embodiment the<br>
picture 40 is provided as a sticky backed decal. To this end, a sticky backed substrate<br>
72 can be provided with the picture 40 cut out hi a predetermined shape including the<br>
picture 40. Alternatively, the decals can be provided in as plastic or vinyl that adheres<br>
to the front face 30 by nature of the materials of the decal and the front face 30. As<br>
best illustrated hi Figure 2, through holes 75 are provided in corners of the flat sheet<br>
25. Additional through holes may be provided for additional securing capability.<br>
The kit 60 also includes a plurality of sheets 80 of position indicators in the<br>
form of decals. The position indicators include the decal 64 and additional exemplary<br>
decals 82,84,86,88,90 and 92. These decals can be selectively peeled off of the<br>
sheets 80 and selectively position on the front face 30 of the flat sheet 25 by hand as<br>
indicated at 68. It is to be understood that the sticky backed decals 64,82,84,86,88,<br>
90, and 92 could be replaced by paper or any other substrate cut to the particular shape<br>
of the tool or simply having a silhouette or picture of the tool to be stored. With a<br>
non-sticking back, the kit may include a glue for adhering the position indicators on<br>
the flat sheet 25. Alternatively, the decals can be formed of a sheet of plastic, vinyl,<br>
or acrylic material that readily adheres to the front face 30 of the flat sheet 25 without<br>
the use of a separate adhesive or sticky backing. This can be accomplished, for<br>
example, by static cling that the particular material of the sheet tends to have. Further,<br>
alternatively, the substrates comprising the position indicators could be magnetic or<br>
have magnets attached to enable easy removal and replacement of the position<br>
indicators at any position as needed over time.<br>
The kit may also include a set of separate magnets 95 for attachment to tools<br>
to be used with the system 10. Magnets of the set can have a variety of shapes and<br>
sizes as shown at 95. By way of example and not by way of limitation, magnets 96 of<br>
the set 95 are elongate block magnets, while others are shorter block, circular, and<br>
toroid shaped magnets. Furthermore, the magnets can be strong rare earth magnets<br>
such as Neodymium or Samarium, which, by their appearance, may have the<br>
advantage of adding beauty to the tools to which they are attached. In particular, the<br>
appearance of a Neodymium magnet can be affected by a nickel coating that is applied<br>
to protect the magnet from corrosion and cracking. The Samarium magnets may have<br>
a rough outer surface that could advantageously aid in frictionally holding the magnet<br>
and tool from sliding on the flat surface 25. Alternatively, the magnets can be ceramic<br>
or alnico. The variety and number of magnets provided should enable holding tools<br>
from four ounces to five pounds on the flat sheet Of course, more than one magnet<br>
can be attached to a tool. However, the magnets should be of the lowest profile<br>
possible in order to avoid interference with proper function of the tool and/or<br>
discomfort to the user. The magnetg can include a sticky back on oae surface for<br>
attachment to the tools. Alternatively, a tube of adhesive 97 can be included with the<br>
kit for attachment of the magnets 95 to the tools.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the kit 60 can include a set of hook and loop<br>
fasteners 98 each comprising a hook substrate 99 and a loop substrate 100. Similarly,<br>
the kit 60 can include a set of magnetic strips 101 comprising individual strips 102.<br>
The hook and loop fasteners 99,100 and the magnetic strips 102 can be placed at any<br>
position and orientation on the front face 30 of the fiat sheet 25. Thus, hook and loop<br>
fasteners 99,100 and magnetic strips 102 provide a similar advantage of enabling<br>
unlimited tool positioning and orientation as set forth with regard to attachment<br>
directly to the flat sheet by a magnet on the tool However, addition of the hook and<br>
loop fastener 99,100 or magnetic strip 102 provides a system kit 60 that is slightly<br>
less simple than a kit without the hook and loop fasteners 99,100 or magnetic strips<br>
102. Yet, some tools may be particularly well adapted for attachment to the flat sheet<br>
25 by these alternative or additional mechaoisms. For example, the drill bit and<br>
grinder subsets 45,50 may benefit from attachment to the flat sheet 25 by hook and<br>
loop fasteners 99,100 over a larger surface area of the front face 30 than is typically<br>
provided by magnets. Another advantage is that the hook and loop fasteners 99,100<br>
could be provided in a variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and holding strengths that may<br>
surpass those available with a set of magnets for a particular holding application.<br>
Furthermore, the magnetic strips 102 may be particularly advantageous, for example,<br>
when a magnetically attracted portion of the tool is available for attachment to the<br>
magnetic strips 102. However, the hook and loop fasteners 99,100 and/or the<br>
magnetic strips 102 are generally intended to be incorporated in addition to the<br>
holding mechanism of magnets attached to tools and magnetically attracted directly to<br>
the flat sheet 25. Furthermore, large or heavy tools such as bit and grinder subsets 45,<br>
50 can be magnetically supported by adding more magnets from the set of magnets 95.<br>
The kit 60 can include a set of instructions 103. The set of instructions can<br>
include a detailed step-by-step description and/or figures to help a person prepare Ms<br>
or her kit for use. The set of instructions will include instructions for guiding a user<br>
during attachment of the magnets to a set of tools, for example, based on the particular<br>
adhesive being used. The adhesive 97, for example, could be a five minute epoxy that<br>
requires specific steps in preparation and application. Of course, the kit can include a<br>
plurality of fasteners 55 for engaging in holes 75 in order to attach the flat sheet 25 to<br>
a wall.<br>
The kit 60 can also include and be sold together with a set of tools 104. This<br>
set of tools 104 can be a set of mixed and matched tools that are ordered at the time<br>
purchase of the kit 60. Attematively, the set of tools can be a matched set These<br>
tools may be standard off the shelf tools that are available in stores or directly from<br>
manufacturers. Alternatively or additionally, the tools in set 104 can include special<br>
tools that have been made with magnets already attached or embedded.<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view of the tool 18 and the flat sheet 25. As<br>
shown, the tool 18 has a magnet 105 embedded in the handle 107. Alternatively, a<br>
magnet 96 from the set of magnets 95 can be attached to an exterior of the tool handle<br>
107, for example. In either case, the tool 18 will be pulled into contact with the flat<br>
sheet 25 under the influence of the magnetic attraction between the magnet 105 or the<br>
magnet 97 and the sheet 25. This magnetic attraction will be sufficient to pull the tool<br>
into holding contact when the tool is released within a certain predetermined range<br>
110. This range 110 is typically from zero to one half of an inch. However, with<br>
stronger magnets this range may be increased.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention includes a method of using a system for<br>
storing and organizing tools. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, this method includes<br>
selecting positions for placement of a variety of tools on a flat sheet of magnetically<br>
attracted material. Once the positions have been selected the position indicators are<br>
attached to those positions as shown at 68 in Figure 2. Advantageously, the positions<br>
for attachment of the tools are not limited to incremental positions. This is due to the<br>
fact that there are no incremental holes or other attaching structure for mounting the<br>
tools on the front face 30 of the flat sheet 25, as is typical with peg boards and the<br>
like. Once the positions have been selected and the position indicators have been<br>
placed on the front face 30, the tools may be stored in an organized fashion. Figure 1<br>
shows tools in superimposed relation overlapping the position indicators with which<br>
they are associated. As depicted in Figure 1, a tool 18 can be grasped by a user's hand<br>
68 and removed from or placed on the front face 30 as indicated by double headed<br>
arrow 112. It is intended that a tool will be stored in overlying relation with the<br>
position indicator with which it is associated. Advantageously, the system does not<br>
require the user to place the tool precisely on the position indicator. That is, if the<br>
user misses the mark, the tool will still be held to the front face 30 of the flat sheet 25<br>
because the magnetic attraction is present at all locations on the front face 30.<br>
However, the intention is that by storing the tools in the preselected positions, the set<br>
of tools can be well organized in order to facilitate finding a particular tool when it is<br>
needed.<br>
As an alternative to the position indicators in the form of decals shaped and<br>
sized similarly to the tools to be stored, the position indicators can be provided as<br>
outlines or cutouts in the shape of the tools to be stored. In one case for example, a<br>
sheet of material could be provided for a set of tools. This sheet of material can<br>
include outlines or cutouts of each of the tools in the set. Thus, by applying a single<br>
decal or sheet, positions and orientations for a complete set of tools can be<br>
established. Similarly, such a sheet can include cutouts for more than one set of tools<br>
on the sheet. Sheets bearing outlines or cutouts of a variety of sets of tools can be<br>
provided to include position indicators for all of the tools to be stored and organized.<br>
In use, the present invention has the advantage of spreading the tools out in<br>
front of the user in a manner that facilitates easy access and enables the user to quickly<br>
see all of the tools, and the locations for missing tools, at once. Unlike storing the<br>
tools in a toolbox or in a cabinet, the present invention allows the user to quickly<br>
grasp a tool without having to open a drawer or dig through several other tools. To<br>
this end, it is intended that the flat sheet will be a flat sheet thai is not supported in a<br>
cabinet or enclosed in any way. However, it is to be understood that the flat sheet can<br>
be of any of a variety of sizes and shapes and could be one of a plurality of flat sheets<br>
that are usable together. Each of a plurality of sheets could be mounted on one or<br>
more walls without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, the flat sheets could be mounted on a pivotal axis in order to provide<br>
access to the various sheets by swinging one sheet about the axis in order to access a<br>
second sheet and so forth. In this arrangement, the sheets could advantageously be<br>
left open and unenclosed. Further alternatively, it is to be understood that separate<br>
sheets could be slidingly mounted on a wall or other support without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, a plurality of flat sheets can be<br>
placed in non-overlapping relation to enable unenclosed access to tools on the flat<br>
sheets.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention includes a method of making a tool set<br>
organizer system. The method of making the tool set organizer system can include<br>
making or assembling the system to include any number of the specifics set forth<br>
above. However, the method of making is not necessarily tied to the specific structure<br>
and details of the above described systems. As shown in a flow diagram 115 of<br>
Figure 4A, the method of making the tool set organizer system includes the step of<br>
presenting options 120, receiving a request 125, and making or packaging the<br>
components 130. By way of example, the method of making can include receiving a<br>
request 125 for a base color or texture for a support substrate of the system. A<br>
textured support substrate can provide the advantage of frictkmally holding a magnet<br>
and an attached tool against sliding on the support substrate. The method of making<br>
the system can also include a request 125 for a picture to be displayed on the support<br>
substrate of the system. Importantly, the method of making the tool organizer system<br>
can include a request 125 for a set of position indicators based on a set of tools to be<br>
organized. Based on one or more requests 125, the system is then formed to provide<br>
an unsupported unenclosed support substrate as a flat sheet for supporting tools in an<br>
organized fashion.<br>
Advantageously, the method of making can be facilitated by receiving requests<br>
over the Internet. This may be achieved by providing a web site for presenting the<br>
features and options that are available for the system The requestor can then access<br>
the web site via a personal computer or the like, and view the features and options that<br>
are presented, For example, the web site can have a number of pictures stored on a<br>
server, such as can be provided hi association with a host computer of the tool<br>
organizer system provider. The server can be remote from the computer of the tool<br>
organizer system provider, and can be connected via the Internet to the requestor's<br>
computer and to the provider's computer. The number of pictures stored on the server<br>
provides the same number of pictures that arc available for the support substrate from<br>
which the requestor can select his or her favorite(s). All the options can thus be<br>
selected and ordered over the Internet<br>
Advantageously, a requestor can indicate a set of tools including a particular<br>
brand for any or all of the tools. Based on the requestor's indication of these<br>
particular tools, the system can be made to include position indicators that match the<br>
particular took. To this end the position indicators for the tools may include a<br>
particular shape, size, and/or color corresponding to the particular tools to be used in<br>
the system. In one particular embodiment, the position indicators comprise full sized<br>
color pictures of the particular tools with which the system is to be used.<br>
To facilitate receiving the request, the options may include specific<br>
predetermined pictures or advertisements that can be included in the system. That is,<br>
a requestor can browse through a preselected set of pictures to find one or more that<br>
appeals to him or hen One option mat could be made available is that the entire flat<br>
sheet could be covered with one of a plurality of preselected pictures. Alternatively,<br>
the requestor could supply the picture that he or she would like displayed on the flat<br>
sheet of his system. This aspect of the invention is particularly well suited for<br>
receiving requests over the Internet, For example, the requestor could include an<br>
attached digital photo with his or her order.<br>
A particular finish can be requested for the front face of the flat sheet. la one<br>
form, this finish can be provided by a sprayed powder 150 that is baked at<br>
temperatures in a range from 375 degrees F to 400 degrees F in an oven 155 as shown<br>
in Figure 5. The oven 155 is exemplary only, and baking the powder coat can be<br>
accomplished by open heat lamps or other heating methods and apparatuses as is well<br>
known in the art. This method of coating is provided al reduced cost when it is<br>
accomplished by an electrostatic process that holds the powder 150 on the flat sheet.<br>
The powder 150 consists of finely ground resin and pigment. While a predetermined<br>
selection of colors can be provided, it is also to be understood that a virtually<br>
unlimited range of colors and textures can be provided. These colors and textures can<br>
be provided with high to low gloss finishes with clear or metallic paints. Low gloss<br>
finishes and/or rougher textures may be utilized to better hold the magnets connecting<br>
the tools to the front face 25, That is, the rougher textures and low gloss finishes can<br>
provide a higher coefficient of friction to frictionally engage the magnets and keep the<br>
tools and magnets from sliding off the front face. It is to be understood that the<br>
finishes arc intended to be of high durability so that repeated scraping and contact by<br>
tools will not deface the finish of the flat face 25 very easily.<br>
The embodiments and examples set forth herein were presented in order to<br>
best explain the present invention and its practical application and to thereby enable<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention. However, those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing description and examples<br>
have been presented for the purposes of illustration and example only. The<br>
description as set forth is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the<br>
precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the<br>
teachings above without departing from the spirit and scope of the forthcoming<br>
claims. For example, while the flat sheet of the present invention is typically formed<br>
of a sheet of 20 or 22 gage steel material, any sheet including magnetically attracted<br>
material is considered within me scope of the invention.<br>
Similarly, while the magnets disclosed herein are typically of a rigid material,<br>
magnets of a flexible material could be used instead without departing from the scope<br>
of the invention. Likewise, while the position indicators are typically provided as<br>
sticky-backed decals, the position indicators could be provided on printable flexible<br>
magnetic sheets in the form of printed full size photographs of the tools to be stored.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention can be implemented with the materials<br>
and products disclosed herein or with alternatives that function equivalency, including<br>
those that have not yet been discovered. Additionally, while the system has been<br>
disclosed primarily as having a single flat sheet for the support substrate* support<br>
substrates having contours on a front or back face are within the scope of the<br>
invention, This is especially so when the contourfs) do not provide a mechanism that,<br>
by itself, will hold a tool on the support substrate. The back face of the support<br>
substrate can be provided with any contour. In particular, such a contour can be<br>
provided to interface with a particular structure on which the support substrate is to be<br>
mounted in a more stable manner.<br>
