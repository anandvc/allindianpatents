				<td>COMPOUND<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a compound.<br>
In particular the present invention relates to a compound and to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound. The present invention also relates to the use of the compound or composition in therapy applications.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Evidence suggests that oestrogens are the major mitogens involved in promoting the growth of tumours in endocrine-dependent tissues, such as the breast and endometrium. Although plasma oestrogen concentrations are similar in women with or without breast cancer, breast tumour oestrone and oestradiol levels are significantly higher than in normal breast tissue or blood. In situ synthesis of oestrogen is thought to make an important contribution to the high levels of oestrogens in tumours and therefore inhibitors, in particular specific inhibitors, of oestrogen biosynthesis are of potential value for the treatment of endocrine-dependent tumours.<br>
Over the past two decades, there has been considerable interest in the development of inhibitors of the aromatase pathway - which converts the androgen precursor androstenedione to oestrone. However, there is now evidence that the oestrone sulphatase (E1-STS) pathway, i.e. the hydrolysis of oestrone sulphate to oestrone (E1S to E1), and aromatase ( i.e. conversion of androstenedione to oestrone) account for the production of oestrogens in breast tumours.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are schematic diagrams showing some of the enzymes involved in the in situ synthesis of oestrone from oestrone sulphate, oestradiol and androstenedione.<br>
in Figure 2, which schematically shows the origin of oestrogenic steroids in postmenopausal women, "ER" denotes Oestrogen Receptor, "DHA-S" denotes Dehydroepiandrosterone-Sulphate, "Adiol" denotes Androstenediol, "E1-STS" denotes Oestrone Sulphatase, "DHA-STS" denotes DHA-sulphatase, "Adiol-STS" denotes Adiol Sulphatase, and "17B-HSD" denotes Oestradiol 17B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.<br><br>
As can be seen, the main two enzymes that are involved in the peripheral synthesis of oestrogens are the aromatase enzyme and the enzyme oestrone sulphatase.<br>
In short, the aromatase enzyme converts androstenedione, which is secreted in large amounts by the adrenal cortex, to oestrone. Recent reports have suggested that some flavones could inhibit aromatase activity.<br>
Much of the oestrone so formed, however, is converted to oestrone sulphate (E1S) and there is now a considerable body of evidence showing that E1S in plasma and tissue acts as a reservoir for the formation of oestrone by the action of oestrone sulphatase.<br>
In this regard, it is now believed that the oestrone sulphatase (E1-STS) pathway - i.e. the hydrolysis of oestrone sulphate to oestrone (E1S to E1) is a major source of oestrogen in breast tumours. This theory is supported by a modest reduction of plasma oestrogen concentration in postmenopausal women with breast cancer treated by aromatase inhibitors, such as aminoglutethimide and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione and also by the fact that plasma E1S concentration in these aromatase inhibitor-treated patients remains relatively high. The long half-life of E1S in blood (10-12 h) compared with the unconjugated oestrogens (20 min) and high levels of steroid sulphatase activity in liver and, normal and malignant breast tissues, also lend support to this theory.<br>
Thus, oestrogen formation in malignant breast and endometrial tissues via the sulphatase pathway makes a major contribution to the high concentration of oestrogens which are present in these tumours.<br>
PCT/GB92/01587 teaches novel steroid sulphatase inhibitors and pharmaceutical compositions containing them for use in the treatment of oestrone dependent tumours, especially breast cancer. These steroid sulphatase inhibitors are sulphamate esters, such as N,N-dimethyl oestrone-3-sulphamate and, preferably, oestrone-3-sulphamate (otherwise known as "EMATE"). EMATE has the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is known that EMATE is a potent E1-STS inhibitor as it displays more than 99%<br>
inhibition of E1-STS activity in intact MCF-7 cells at 0.1 nM.  EMATE also inhibits the E1-<br>
STS enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, indicating that it acts as an<br>
active site-directed inactivator. Although EMATE was originally designed for the inhibition<br>
of E1-STS, it also inhibits dehydroepiandrosterone sulphatase (DHA-STS), which is an<br>
enzyme that is believed to have a pivotal role in regulating the biosynthesis of the<br>
oestrogenic steroid  androstenediol.     Also,  there  is  now evidence  to  suggest that<br>
androstenediol may be of even greater importance as a promoter of breast tumour<br>
growth.   EMATE is also active in vivo as almost complete inhibition of rat liver E1-STS<br>
(99%) and DHA-STS (99%) activities resulted when it is administered either orally or<br>
subcutaneously.     In addition, EMATE has been shown to have a memory enhancing<br>
effect in rats. Studies in mice have suggested an association between DHA-STS activity<br>
and the regulation of part of the immune response.  It is thought that this may also occur<br>
in humans.   The bridging O-atom of the sulphamate moiety in EMATE is important for<br>
inhibitory activity.    Thus, when the 3-O-atom is replaced by other heteroatoms as in<br>
oestrone-3-N-sulphamate and oestrone-3-S-sulphamate, these analogues are weaker<br>
non-time-dependent inactivators.<br>
In addition to oestrone, the other major steroid with oestrogenic properties which is produced by postmenopausal women is androstenediol (see Figure 2).<br>
Androstenediol, although an androgen, can bind to the oestrogen receptor (ER) and can stimulate the growth of ER positive breast cancer cells and the growth of carcinogen-induced mammary tumours in the rat. Importantly, in postmenopausal women 90% of the androstenediol produced originates from the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-S) which is secreted in large amounts by the adrenal cortex. DHA-S is converted to DHA by DHA sulphatase, which may be the same as, or different from, the enzyme, oestrone sulphatase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of E1S.<br>
During the last 10-15 years considerable research has also been carried out to develop patent aromatase inhibitors, some of which are now marketed. However, in three recent reports of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received aromatase inhibitor therapy, plasma E1S concentrations remained between 400-1000 pg/ml.<br>
In summation therefore in situ synthesis of oestrogen is thought to make an important contribution to the high levels of oestrogens in tumours and therefore specific inhibitors of oestrogen biosynthesis are of potential value for the treatment of endocrine-dependent tumours.<br>
Moreover, even though oestrogen formation in malignant breast and endometrial tissues via the sulphatase pathway makes a major contribution to the high concentration of oestrogens, there are still other enzymatic pathways that contribute to in vivo synthesis of oestrogen.<br>

SOME ADVANTAGES<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can inhibit steroid sulphatase (STS) activity.<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can modulate cell cycling.<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can modulate apoptosis.<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can modulate cell growth.<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can prevent and/or suppress glucose uptake by a tumour.<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can prevent and/or inhibit tumour angiogenesis.<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can disrupt microtubules.<br>
In this respect, microtubules, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments form part of the cytoskeletal system of a cell. Microtubules are responsible for many of cell movements-examples include the beating of cilia and flagella and the transport of membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm. All these movements result from the polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules or the actions of the microtubule motor proteins dynein and kinesins. Some other cell movements , such as the alignment and separation of chromosomes during meiosis and mitosis result from both mechanisms. Microtubules also direct cell movement but in some cases, microtubules serve purely structural functions.<br>
A microtubule is composed of subunits that are heterodimers of a-tubulin and p-tubulin monomers. There are two populations of microtubules: stable, long-lived microtubules and dynamic, short lived microtubules. Dynamic microtubules are found when the microtubule structures need to assemble and dissemble quickly. For example, during mitosis, the cytosolic microtubule network characteristic of interphase cells disappears and the tubulin from it is used to form the spindle apparatus which partitions chromosomes equally to the daughter cells. When mitosis is complete, the spindle disassembles and the interphase microtubule network reforms.<br>
Drugs that inhibit mitosis provide a useful means to manipulate the microtubules in a cell. Three drugs: colchicine, vinblastine and taxol - all purified from plants - have proved to be very powerful probes of microtubule function partly because they bind only to tubulin or microtubuies and not to other proteins and also because their concentrations in cells can be easily controlled.<br>
Because of their effects on mitosis, microtubule inhibitors have been widely used to treat illness and more recently as anticancer agents, since blockage of spindle formation will preferentially inhibit rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells. A highly effective anti-ovarian cancer agent is taxol. In ovarian cancer cells, which undergo rapid cell divisions, mitosis is blocked by taxol treatment while other functions carried out by intact microtubules are not affected. A comprehensive review of microtubules can be found in "Molecular Cell Biology" (Ed: Lodish et al 1995 WH Freeman and Co. New York pp 1051-1122).<br>
One key advantage of the present invention is that the compounds of the present invention can induce apoptosis.<br>
Apoptosis is induced by MT-targeting drugs, a process which may involve the phosphorylation (and inactivation) of the apoptosis regulator, the bcl-2 protein (Haider, Cancer Res. 57:229, 1997).<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising finding that the compound provides an effective treatment of cancer.<br>
Another advantage of the compounds of the present invention is that they may be potent in vivo.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention may be non-oestrogenic compounds. Here, the term "non-oestrogenic" means exhibiting no or substantially no oestrogenic activity. Here, by the term "non-oestrogenic" means exhibiting no or substantially no systemic oestrogenic activity, such as that determined by Protocol 4.<br>
For some applications, the compounds have an oestrogenic effect.<br>
Another advantage is that some of the compounds may not be capable of being metabolised to compounds which display or induce hormonal activity.<br>
For some applications, preferably the compounds have a reversible action.<br>
For some applications, preferably the compounds have an irreversible action.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention are also advantageous in that they may<br><br>
be orally active<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention may useful for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer, such as breast cancer, as well as (or in the alternative) non-malignant conditions, such as the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory conditions - such as conditions associated with any one or more of: autoimmunity, including for example, rheumatoid arthritis, type I and II diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, thyroiditis, vasculitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, skin disorders e.g. acne, psoriasis and contact dermatitis; graft versus host disease; eczema; asthma and organ rejection following transplantation. The compounds of the present invention are useful particularly when Pharmaceuticals may need to be administered from an early age.<br>

COMPOSITION<br>
As described above according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) (i) a compound as defined herein, or (ii) a composition as defined herein, and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient or adjuvant.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the composition of the present invention may comprise more than one biological response modifier.<br>
The term biological response modifier ("BRM") includes cytokines, immune modulators, growth factors, haematopoiesis regulating factors, colony stimulating factors, chemotactic, haemolytic and thrombolytic factors, cell surface receptors, ligands, leukocyte adhesion molecules, monoclonal antibodies, preventative and therapeutic vaccines, hormones, extracellular matrix components, fibronectin, etc.<br>
BRMs may play a role in modulating the immune and inflammatory response in disorders. Examples of BRMs include: Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor, erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interferons (IFNs), interleukins, tissue plasminogen activators, P-, E- or L- Selectins, ICAM-1, VCAM, Selectins, addressins etc.<br>
Preferably, the biological response modifier is a cytokine.<br>
A cytokine is a molecule - often a soluble protein - that allows immune cells to communicate with each other. These molecules exert their biological functions through specific receptors expressed on the surface of target cells. Binding of the receptors triggers the release of a cascade of biochemical signals which profoundly affect the behaviour of the cell bearing the receptor (Poole, S 1995 TibTech 13: 81-82). Many cytokines and their receptors have been identified at the molecular level (Paul and Sedar 1994, Cell 76: 241-251) and make suitable molecules of therapeutic value as well as therapeutic targets in their own right.<br>
More details on cytokines can be found in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Pub. VCH, Ed. Meyers, 1995, pages 202, 203, 394, 390, 475, 790).<br>
Examples of cytokines include: interleukins (IL) - such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, lL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-19; Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) - such as TNF-α; Interferon alpha, beta and gamma; TGF-ß.<br>
For the present invention, preferably the cytokine is tumour necrosis factor (TNF). More preferably the cytokine is TNF-α.<br>
TNF is a cytokine produced by macrophages and lymphocytes which mediates inflammatory and immunopathological responses. TNF has been implicated in the progression of diseases which include but are not limited to immunomodulation disorder, infection, cell proliferation, angiogenesis (neovascularisation), tumour metastasis, apoptosis, sepsis, and endotoxaemia.<br>
The necrotising action of TNF in vivo mainly relates to capillary injury. TNF causes necrosis not only in tumour tissue but also in granulation tissue. It causes morphological changes in growth inhibition of and cytoxicity against cultured vascular endothelial cells (Haranka etal 1987 Ciba Found Symp 131: 140-153).<br>
For the preferred aspect of the present invention, the TNF may be any type of TNF - such as TNF-α, TNF-ß, including derivatives or mixtures thereof.<br>
Teachings on TNF may be found in the art - such as WO-A-98/08870 and WO-A-98/13348.<br>
The TNF can be prepared chemically or it can be extracted from sources. Preferably, the TNF is prepared by use of recombinant DNA techniques.<br>
With this aspect of the present invention the compositions of the present invention are more potent in vivo than the compounds alone or TNF alone. Moreover, in some aspects the combination of compounds and TNF is more potent than one would expect from the potency of the compound alone i.e. this is a synergistic relationship between them.<br>
In addition, the present invention contemplates the composition of the present invention further comprising an inducer of the biological response modifier - such as in vivo inducer of the biological response modifier.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the components of the composition can be added in admixture, simultaneously or sequentially. Furthermore, in accordance with the present invention it may be possible to form at least a part of the composition in situ (such as in vivo) by inducing the expression of - or increasing the expression of - one of the components. For example, it may be possible to induce the expression of - or increase the expression of - the biological response modifier, such as TNF. By way of example, it may be possible to induce the expression of - or increase the expression of - TNF by adding bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP). In this regard, bacterial LPS and MDP in combination can stimulate TNF production from murine spleen cells in vitro and tumour regression in vivo (Fuks et al Biull Eksp Biol Med 1987 104: 497-499).<br>
In the method of treatment, the subject is preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. For some applications, preferably the human is a woman.<br>
The present invention also covers novel intermediates that are useful to prepare the compounds of the present invention. For example, the present invention covers novel alcohol precursors for the compounds. By way of further example, the present invention covers bis protected precursors for the compounds. Examples of each of these precursors are presented herein. The present invention also encompasses a process comprising each or both of those precursors for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
STEROID SULPHATASE<br>
Steroid sulphatase - which is sometimes referred to as steroid sulphatase or steryl sulphatase or "STS" for short - hydrolyses several sulphated steroids, such as oestrone sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and cholesterol sulphate. STS has been allocated the enzyme number EC 3.1.6.2.<br>
STS has been cloned and expressed. For example see Stein et al (J. Biol. Chem. 264:13865-13872 (1989)) and Yen et al (Cell 49:443-454(1987)).<br>
STS is an enzyme that has been implicated in a number of disease conditions.<br>
By way of example, workers have found that a total deficiency in STS produces ichthyosis. According to some workers, STS deficiency is fairly prevalent in Japan. The same workers (Sakura et al, J Inherit Metab Dis 1997 Nov;20(6):807-10) have also reported that allergic diseases - such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis - may be associated with a steroid sulphatase deficiency.<br>
In addition to disease states being brought on through a total lack of STS activity, an increased level of STS activity may also bring about disease conditions. By way of example, and as indicated above, there is strong evidence to support a role of STS in breast cancer growth and metastasis.<br>
STS has also been implicated in other disease conditions. By way of example, Le Roy et al (Behav Genet 1999 Mar;29(2):131-6) have determined that there may be a genetic correlation between steroid sulphatase concentration and initiation of attack behaviour in mice. The authors conclude that sulphatation of steroids may be the prime mover of a complex network, including genes shown to be implicated in aggression by mutagenesis.<br>
STS INHIBITION<br>
It is believed that some disease conditions associated with STS activity are due to conversion of a nonactive, sulphated oestrone to an active, nonsulphated oestrone. In disease conditions associated with STS activity, it would be desirable to inhibit STS activity.<br>
Here, the term "inhibit" includes reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of STS.<br>
STS INHIBITOR<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the compound of the present invention is capable of acting as an STS inhibitor.<br>
Here, the term "inhibitor" as used herein with respect to the compound of the present invention means a compound that can inhibit STS activity - such as reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of STS. The STS inhibitor may act as an antagonist.<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity can be assessed using either intact JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells or placental microsomes. In addition, an animal model may be used. Details on suitable Assay Protocols are presented in following sections. It is to be noted that other assays could be used to determine STS activity and thus STS inhibition. For example, reference may also be made to the teachings of WO-A-99/50453.<br>
In one aspect, for some applications, the compound is further characterised by the feature that if the sulphamate group were to be substituted by a sulphate group to form a sulphate derivative, then the sulphate derivative would be hydrolysable by an enzyme having steroid sulphatase (E.C. 3.1.6.2) activity - i.e. when incubated with steroid sulphatase EC 3.1.6.2 at pH 7.4 and 37°C.<br>

(PROTOCOL 1)<br>
Inhibition of Steroid Sulphatase Activity in JEG3 cells<br>
Steroid sulphatase activity is measured in vitro using intact JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells. This cell line may be used to study the control of human breast cancer cell growth. It possesses significant steroid sulphatase activity (Boivin et al.,J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43: 4465 - 4478) and is available in from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).<br>

(PROTOCOL 4)<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be studied using an animal model, in<br>
particular in ovariectomised rats. In this model, compounds which are oestrogenic stimulate uterine growth.<br>
The compound (0.1 mg/Kg/day for five days) was administered orally to rats with another group of animals receiving vehicle only (propylene glycol). At the end of the study uteri were obtained and weighed with the results being expressed as uterine weight/whole body weight x 100.<br>
Compounds having no significant effect on uterine growth are not oestrogenic.<br>
BIOTECHNOLOGICAL ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING STS ACTIVITY<br>
(PROTOCOL 5)<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity can also be assessed using amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences encoding STS, or active fragments, derivatives, homologues or variants thereof in, for example, high-through put screens.<br>
Any one or more of appropriate targets - such as an amino acid sequence and/or nucleotide sequence - may be used for identifying an agent capable of modulating STS in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The target employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The abolition of target activity or the formation of binding complexes between the target and the agent being tested may be measured.<br>
The assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through put screen.<br>
Techniques for drug screening may be based on the method described in Geysen, European Patent Application 84/03564, published on September 13, 1984. In summary, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesised on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with a suitable target or fragment thereof and washed. Bound entities are then detected - such as by appropriately adapting methods well known in the art. A purified target can also be coated directly onto plates for use in a drug screening techniques. Alternatively, non-neutralising antibodies can be used to capture the peptide and<br>
immobilise it on a solid support.<br>
This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a target specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a target.<br>
Another technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.<br>
It is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays.<br>
In one preferred aspect, the present invention relates to a method of identifying agents that selectively modulate STS, which compounds have the formula (I).<br>
REPORTERS<br>
A wide variety of reporters may be used in the assay methods (as well as screens) of the present invention with preferred reporters providing conveniently detectable signals (e.g. by spectroscopy). By way of example, a reporter gene may encode an enzyme which catalyses a reaction which alters light absorption properties.<br>
Other protocols include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilising monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes may even be used. These and other assays are described, among other places, in Hampton R et al (1990, Serological Methods, A Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St Paul MN) and Maddox DE et al (1983, J Exp Med 15 8:121 1).<br>
Examples of reporter molecules include but are not limited to (p-galactosidase, invertase, green fluorescent protein, luciferase, chloramphenicol, acetyltransferase, (-glucuronidase, exo-glucanase and glucoamylase. Alternatively, radiolabelled or fluorescent tag-labelled nucleotides can be incorporated into nascent transcripts which are then identified when bound to oligonucleotide probes.<br>
By way of further examples, a number of companies such as  Pharmacia  Biotech<br>
(Piscataway, NJ), Promega (Madison, Wl), and US Biochemical Corp (Cleveland, OH)<br>
supply commercial kits and protocols for assay procedures. Suitable reporter molecules or labels include those radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include US-A-3817837; US-A-3850752; US-A-3939350; US-A-3996345; US-A-4277437; US-A-4275149 and US-A-4366241.<br>
HOST CELLS<br>
The term "host cell" - in relation to the present invention includes any cell that could comprise the target for the agent of the present invention.<br>
Thus, a further embodiment of the present invention provides host cells transformed or transfected with a polynucleotide that is or expresses the target of the present invention. Preferably said poiynucleotide is carried in a vector for the replication and expression of polynucleotides that are to be the target or are to express the target. The cells will be chosen to be compatible with the said vector and may for example be prokaryotic (for example bacterial), fungal, yeast or plant cells.<br>
The gram negative bacterium E. coli is widely used as a host for heterologous gene expression. However, large amounts of heterologous protein tend to accumulate inside the cell. Subsequent purification of the desired protein from the bulk of E.coli intracellular proteins can sometimes be difficult.<br>
In contrast to E.coli, bacteria from the genus Bacillus are very suitable as heterologous hosts because of their capability to secrete proteins into the culture medium. Other bacteria suitable as hosts are those from the genera Streptomyces and Pseudomonas.<br>
Depending on the nature of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention, and/or the desirability for further processing of the expressed protein, eukaryotic hosts such as yeasts or other fungi may be preferred. In general, yeast cells are preferred over fungal cells because they are easier to manipulate. However, some proteins are either poorly secreted from the yeast cell, or in some cases are not processed properly (e.g. hyperglycosylation in yeast). In these instances, a different fungal host organism should be selected.<br>
Examples of suitable expression hosts within the scope of the present invention are fungi<br>
such as Aspergillus species (such as those described in EP-A-0184438 and EP-A-<br>
(284603) and Trichoderma species; bacteria such as Bacillus species (such as those described in EP-A-0134048 and EP-A-0253455), Streptomyces species and Pseudomonas species; and yeasts such as Kluyveromyces species (such as those described in EP-A-0096430 and EP-A-0301670) and Saccharomyces species. By way of example, typical expression hosts may be selected from Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger var. tubigenis, Aspergillus niger var. awamori, Aspergillus aculeatis, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus orvzae, Trichoderma reesei, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
The use of suitable host cells - such as yeast, fungal and plant host cells - may provide for post-translational modifications (e.g. myristoylation, glycosylation, truncation, lapidation and tyrosine, serine or threonine phosphorylation) as may be needed to confer optimal biological activity on recombinant expression products of the present invention.<br>
ORGANISM<br>
The term "organism" in relation to the present invention includes any organism that could comprise the target according to the present invention and/or products obtained therefrom. Examples of organisms may include a fungus, yeast or a plant.<br>
The term "transgenic organism" in relation to the present invention includes any organism that comprises the target according to the present invention and/or products obtained.<br>
TRANSFORMATION OF HOST CELLS/HOST ORGANISMS<br>
As indicated earlier, the host organism can be a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic organism. Examples of suitable prokaryotic hosts include E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. Teachings on the transformation of prokaryotic hosts is well documented in the art, for example see Sambrook et al (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press) and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
If a prokaryotic host is used then the nucleotide sequence may need to be suitably modified before transformation - such as by removal of introns.<br>
In another embodiment the transgenic organism can be a yeast.   In this regard, yeast<br>
have also been widely used as a vehicle for heterologous gene expression.  The species<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a long history of industrial use, including its use for heterologous gene expression. Expression of heterologous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been reviewed by Goodey et al (1987, Yeast Biotechnology, D R Berry et al, eds, pp 401-429, Allen and Unwin, London) and by King et al (1989, Molecular and Cell Biology of Yeasts, E F Walton and G T Yarronton, eds, pp 107-133, Blackie, Glasgow),<br>
For several reasons Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited for heterologous gene expression. First, it is non-pathogenic to humans and it is incapable of producing certain endotoxins. Second, it has a long history of safe use following centuries of commercial exploitation for various purposes. This has led to wide public acceptability. Third, the extensive commercial use and research devoted to the organism has resulted in a wealth of knowledge about the genetics and physiology as well as large-scale fermentation characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
A review of the principles of heterologous gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and secretion of gene products is given by E Hinchcliffe E Kenny (1993, "Yeast as a vehicle for the expression of heterologous genes", Yeasts, Vol 5, Anthony H Rose and J Stuart Harrison, eds, 2nd edition, Academic Press Ltd.).<br>
Several types of yeast vectors are available, including integrative vectors, which require recombination with the host genome for their maintenance, and autonomously replicating plasmid vectors.<br>
In order to prepare the transgenic Saccharomyces, expression constructs are prepared by inserting the nucleotide sequence into a construct designed for expression in yeast. Several types of constructs used for heterologous expression have been developed. The constructs contain a promoter active in yeast fused to the nucleotide sequence, usually a promoter of yeast origin, such as the GAL1 promoter, is used. Usually a signal sequence of yeast origin, such as the sequence encoding the SUC2 signal peptide, is used. A terminator active in yeast ends the expression system.<br>
For the transformation of yeast several transformation protocols have been developed. For example, a transgenic Saccharomyces according to the present invention can be prepared by following the teachings of Hinnen et al (1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 75, 1929); Beggs, J D (1978, Nature, London, 275,<br>
104); and Ito, H et al (1983, J Bacteriology 153, 163-168).<br>
The transformed yeast cells are selected using various selective markers. Among the markers used for transformation are a number of auxotrophic markers such as LEU2, HIS4 and TRP1, and dominant antibiotic resistance markers such as aminoglycoside antibiotic markers, e.g. G418.<br>
Another host organism is a plant. The basic principle in the construction of genetically modified plants is to insert genetic information in the plant genome so as to obtain a stable maintenance of the inserted genetic material. Several techniques exist for inserting the genetic information, the two main principles being direct introduction of the genetic information and introduction of the genetic information by use of a vector system. A review of the general techniques may be found in articles by Potrykus (Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol [1991] 42:205-225) and Christou (Agro-Food-Industry Hi-Tech March/April 1994 17-27). Further teachings on plant transformation may be found in EP-A-0449375.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a method of transforming a host cell with a nucleotide sequence that is to be the target or is to express the target. Host cells transformed with the nucleotide sequence may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression of the encoded protein. The protein produced by a recombinant cell may be displayed on the surface of the cell. If desired, and as will be understood by those of skill in the art, expression vectors containing coding sequences can be designed with signal sequences which direct secretion of the coding sequences through a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. Other recombinant constructions may join the coding sequence to nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide domain which will facilitate purification of soluble proteins (Kroll DJ et al (1993) DNA Cell Biol 12:441-53).<br>
VARIANTS/HOMOLOGUES/DERIVATIVES<br>
In addition to the specific amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences mentioned herein, the present invention also encompasses the use of variants, homologue and derivatives thereof. Here, the term "homology" can be equated with "identity".<br>
In the present context, an homologous sequence is taken to include an amino acid sequence which may be at least 75, 85 or 90% identical, preferably at least 95 or 98% identical. Although homology can also be considered in terms of similarity (i.e. amino acid<br>
residues having similar chemical properties/functions), in the context of the present invention it is preferred to express homology in terms of sequence identity.<br>
Homology comparisons can be conducted by eye, or more usually, with the aid of readily available sequence comparison programs. These commercially available computer programs can calculate % homology between two or more sequences.<br>
% homology may be calculated over contiguous sequences, i.e. one sequence is aligned with the other sequence and each amino acid in one sequence is directly compared with the corresponding amino acid in the other sequence, one residue at a time. This is called an "ungapped" alignment. Typically, such ungapped alignments are performed only over a relatively short number of residues.<br>
Although this is a very simple and consistent method, it fails to take into consideration that, for example, in an otherwise identical pair of sequences, one insertion or deletion will cause the following amino acid residues to be put out of alignment, thus potentially resulting in a large reduction in % homology when a global alignment is performed. Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without penalising unduly the overall homology score. This is achieved by inserting "gaps" in the sequence alignment to try to maximise local homology.<br>
However, these more complex methods assign "gap penalties" to each gap that occurs in the alignment so that, for the same number of identical amino acids, a sequence alignment with as few gaps as possible - reflecting higher relatedness between the two compared sequences - will achieve a higher score than one with many gaps. "Affine gap costs" are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties will of course produce optimised alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap penalties to be modified. However, it is preferred to use the default values when using such software for sequence comparisons. For example when using the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (see below) the default gap penalty for amino acid sequences is -12 for a gap and -4 for each extension.<br>
Calculation of maximum % homology therefore firstly requires the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program<br>
for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (University of<br>
Wisconsin, U.S.A.; Devereux et al., 1984, Nucleic Acids Research 12:387). Examples of other software than can perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid - Chapter 18), FASTA (Atschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program.<br>
A further useful reference is that found in FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 May 15;174(2):247-50 (and a published erratum appears in FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 Aug 1;177(1 ):187-8).<br>
Although the final % homology can be measured in terms of identity, the alignment process itself is typically not based on an all-or-nothing pair comparison. Instead, a scaled similarity score matrix is generally used that assigns scores to each pain/vise comparison based on chemical similarity or evolutionary distance. An example of such a matrix commonly used is the BLOSUM62 matrix - the default matrix for the BLAST suite of programs. GCG Wisconsin programs generally use either the public default values or a custom symbol comparison table if supplied (see user manual for further details). It is preferred to use the public default values for the GCG package, or in the case of other software, the default matrix, such as BLOSUM62.<br>
Once the software has produced an optimal alignment, it is possible to calculate % homology, preferably % sequence identity. The software typically does this as part of the sequence comparison and generates a numerical result.<br>
The sequences may also have deletions, insertions or substitutions of amino acid residues which produce a silent change and result in a functionally equivalent substance. Deliberate amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues as long as the secondary binding activity of the substance is retained. For example, negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid; positively charged amino acids include lysine and arginine; and amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values include leucine, isoleucine, valine, glycine, alanine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine.<br>
Conservative substitutions may be made, for example according to the Table below.<br>
Amino acids in the same block in the second column and preferably in the same line in<br>
the  third column may be substituted for each other:<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
The nucleotide sequence for use as the target or for expressing the target can be incorporated into a recombinant replicable vector. The vector may be used to replicate and express the nucleotide sequence in and/or from a compatible host cell. Expression may be controlled using control sequences which include promoters/enhancers and other expression regulation signals, Prokaryotic promoters and promoters functional in eukaryotic cells may be used. Tissue specific or stimuli specific promoters may be used. Chimeric promoters may also be used comprising sequence elements from two or more different promoters described above.<br>
The protein produced by a host recombinant cell by expression of the nucleotide sequence may be secreted or may be contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. The coding sequences can be designed with signal sequences which direct secretion of the substance coding sequences through a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane.<br>
FUSION PROTEINS<br>
The target amino acid sequence may be produced as a fusion protein, for example to aid in extraction and purification. Examples of fusion protein partners include glutathione-S-transferase (GST), 6xHis, GAL4 (DNA binding and/or transcriptional activation domains) and □-galactosidase. It may also be convenient to include a proteolytic cleavage site between the fusion protein partner and the protein sequence of interest to allow removal of fusion protein sequences. Preferably the fusion protein will not hinder the activity of the target.<br>
The fusion protein may comprise an antigen or an antigenic determinant fused to the<br>
substance of the present invention. In this embodiment, the fusion protein may be a non-naturally occurring fusion protein comprising a substance which may act as an adjuvant in the sense of providing a generalised stimulation of the immune system. The antigen or antigenic determinant may be attached to either the amino or carboxy terminus of the substance.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the amino acid sequence may be ligated to a heterologous sequence to encode a fusion protein. For example, for screening of peptide libraries for agents capable of affecting the substance activity, it may be useful to encode a chimeric substance expressing a heterologous epitope that is recognised by a commercially available antibody.<br>
THERAPY<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used as therapeutic agents - i.e. in therapy applications.<br>
The term "therapy" includes curative effects, alleviation effects, and prophylactic effects. The therapy may be on humans or animals, preferably female animals. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound according to the present invention and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient (including combinations thereof).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine and will typically comprise any one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as - or in addition to - the carrier, excipient<br>
or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s),<br>
solubilising agent(s).<br>
Preservatives, stabilisers, dyes and even flavouring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.<br>
There may be different composition/formulation requirements dependent on the different delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.<br>
Where the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant to the detergent effects of bile.<br>
Where appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation, in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a conventional manner.<br>

Examples of other STS inhibitors may be found in the above references. By way of example, STS inhibitors for use in the present invention include either or both of the 2-ethyl and 2-methoxy 17-deoxy compounds that are analogous to compound 5 presented herein.<br>

Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body weight.<br>
By way of further example, the agents of the present invention may be administered in accordance with a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
Aside from the typical modes of delivery - indicated above - the term "administered" also includes delivery by techniques such as lipid mediated transfection, liposomes, immunoliposomes, lipofectin, cationic facial amphiphiles (CFAs) and combinations thereof. The routes for such delivery mechanisms include but are not limited to mucosal, nasal, oral, parenteral, gastrointestinal, topical, or sublingual routes.<br>
The term "administered" includes but is not limited to delivery by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or as an ingestable solution; a parenteral route where delivery is by an injectable form, such as, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route.<br>
Thus, for pharmaceutical administration, the STS inhibitors of the present invention can be formulated in any suitable manner utilising conventional pharmaceutical formulating techniques and pharmaceutical carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents etc. and usually for parenteral administration. Approximate effective dose rates may be in the range from 1 to 1000 mg/day, such as from 10 to 900 mg/day or even from 100 to 800 mg/day depending on the individual activities of the compounds in question and for a patient of average (70Kg) bodyweight. More usual dosage rates for the preferred and more active compounds will be in the range 200 to 800 mg/day, more preferably, 200 to 500 mg/day, most preferably from 200 to 250 mg/day. They may be given in single dose regimes, split dose regimes and/or in multiple dose regimes lasting over several days. For oral administration they may be formulated in tablets, capsules, solution or suspension containing from 100 to 500 mg of compound per unit dose. Alternatively and preferably the compounds will be formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable parenterally administrate carrier and providing single daily dosage rates in the range 200 to 800 mg, preferably 200 to 500, more preferably 200 to 250 mg. Such effective daily doses will, however, vary depending on inherent activity of the active ingredient and on the bodyweight of the patient, such variations being within the skill and judgement of the physician.<br>
CELL CYCLING<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be useful in the method of treatment of a cell cycling disorder.<br>
As discussed in "Molecular Cell Biology" 3rd Ed. Lodish et al. pages 177-181 different eukaryotic cells can grow and divide at quite different rates. Yeast cells, for example, can divide every 120 min., and the first divisions of fertilised eggs in the embryonic cells of sea urchins and insects take only 1530 min. because one large pre-existing cell is subdivided. However, most growing plant and animal cells take 10-20 hours to double in number, and some duplicate at a much slower rate. Many cells in adults, such as nerve cells and striated muscle cells, do not divide at all; others, like the fibroblasts that assist in healing wounds, grow on demand but are otherwise quiescent.<br>
Still, every eukaryotic cell that divides must be ready to donate equal genetic material to two daughter cells. DNA synthesis in eukaryotes does not occur throughout the cell division cycle but is restricted to a part of it before cell division.<br>
The relationship between eukaryotic DNA synthesis and cell division has been thoroughly analysed in cultures of mammalian cells that were all capable of growth and division. In contrast to bacteria, it was found, eukaryotic cells spend only a part of their time in DNA synthesis, and it is completed hours before cell division (mitosis). Thus a gap of time occurs after DNA synthesis and before cell division; another gap was found to occur after division and before the next round of DNA synthesis. This analysis led to the conclusion that the eukaryotic cell cycle consists of an M (mitotic) phase, a G^ phase (the first gap), the S (DNA synthesis) phase, a G2 phase (the second gap), and back to M. The phases between mitoses (G1 S, and G2) are known collectively as the interphase.<br>
Many nondividing cells in tissues (for example, all quiescent fibroblasts) suspend the cycle after mitosis and just prior to DNA synthesis; such "resting" cells are said to have<br>
exited from the cell cycle and to be in the Go state.<br>
It is possible to identify cells when they are in one of the three interphase stages of the cell cycle, by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to measure their relative DNA content: a cell that is in G1 (before DNA synthesis) has a defined amount x of DNA; during S (DNA replication), it has between x and 2x; and when in G2 (or M), it has 2x of DNA.<br>
The stages of mitosis and cytokinesis in an animal cell are as follows<br>
(a) Interphase. The G2 stage of interphase immediately precedes the beginning of mitosis. Chromosomal DNA has been replicated and bound to protein during the S phase, but chromosomes are not yet seen as distinct structures. The nucleolus is the only nuclear substructure that is visible under light microscope. In a diploid cell before DNA replication there are two morphologic chromosomes of each type, and the cell is said to be 2n. In G2, after DNA replication, the cell is 4n. There are four copies of each chromosomal DNA. Since the sister chromosomes have not yet separated from each other, they are called sister chromatids.<br>
b) Early prophase. Centrioles, each with a newly formed daughter centriole, begin moving toward opposite poles of the cell; the chromosomes can be seen as long threads. The nuclear membrane begins to disaggregate into small vesicles.<br>
(c)	Middle and late prophase.  Chromosome condensation is completed; each visible<br>
chromosome structure is composed of two chromatids held together at their centromeres.<br>
Each chromatid contains one of the two newly replicated daughter DNA molecules.  The<br>
microtubular spindle begins to radiate from the regions just adjacent to the centrioles,<br>
which are moving closer to their poles. Some spindle fibres reach from pole to pole; most<br>
go to chromatids and attach at kinetochores.<br>
(d)	Metaphase.   The chromosomes move toward the equator of the cell, where they<br>
become aligned in the equatorial plane. The sister chromatids have not yet separated.<br>
(e)	Anaphase.   The two sister chromatids separate into independent chromosomes.<br>
Each contains a centromere that is linked by a spindle fibre to one pole, to which it<br>
moves.    Thus one copy of each chromosome is donated to each daughter cell.<br>
Simultaneously, the cell elongates, as do the pole-to-pole spindles. Cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow starts to form,<br>
(f)	Telophase.  New membranes form around the daughter nuclei; the chromosomes<br>
uncoil and become less distinct, the nucleolus becomes visible again, and the nuclear<br>
membrane forms around each daughter nucleus. Cytokinesis is nearly complete, and the<br>
spindle disappears as the microtubules and other fibres depolymerise.    Throughout<br>
mitosis the "daughter" centriole at each pole grows until it is full-length. At telophase the<br>
duplication of each of the original centrioles is completed, and new daughter centrioles<br>
will be generated during the next interphase.<br>
(g)	Interphase.   Upon the completion of cytokinesis, the cell enters the G! phase of<br>
the cell cycle and proceeds again around the cycle.<br>
It will be appreciated that cell cycling is an extremely important cell process. Deviations from normal cell cycling can result in a number of medical disorders. Increased and/or unrestricted cell cycling may result in cancer. Reduced cell cycling may result in degenerative conditions. Use of the compound of the present invention may provide a means to treat such disorders and conditions.<br>
Thus, the compound of the present invention may be suitable for use in the treatment of cell cycling disorders such as cancers, including hormone dependent and hormone independent cancers.<br>
In addition, the compound of the present invention may be suitable for the treatment of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, sarcomas, melanomas, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer etc. and other solid tumours.<br>
For some applications, cell cycling is inhibited and/or prevented and/or arrested, preferably wherein cell cycling is prevented and/or arrested. In one aspect cell cycling may be inhibited and/or prevented and/or arrested in the G2/M phase. In one aspect cell cycling may be irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested, preferably wherein cell cycling is irreversibly prevented and/or arrested.<br>
By the term "irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested" it is meant after application of a compound of the present invention, on removal of the compound the effects of the compound, namely prevention and/or inhibition and/or arrest of cell cycling, are still observable. More particularly by the term "irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or<br>
arrested" it is meant that when assayed in accordance with the cell cycling assay protocol<br>
presented herein, cells treated with a compound of interest show less growth after Stage 2 of the protocol I than control cells. Details on this protocol are presented below.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides compounds which: cause inhibition of growth of oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER-) breast cancer cells in vitro by preventing and/or inhibiting and/or arresting cell cycling; and/or cause regression of nitroso-methyl urea (NMU)-induced mammary tumours in intact animals (i.e. not ovariectomised), and/or prevent and/or inhibit and/or arrest cell cycling in cancer cells; and/or act in vivo by preventing and/or inhibiting and/or arresting cell cycling and/or act as a cell cycling agonist.<br>
CELL CYCLING ASSAY<br>
(PROTOCOL 7) Procedure Stage 1<br>
MCF-7 breast cancer cells are seeded into multi-well culture plates at a density of 105 cells/well. Cells were allowed to attach and grown until about 30% confluent when they are treated as follows:<br>
Control - no treatment Compound of Interest (COI)<br>
Cells are grown for 6 days in growth medium containing the COI with changes of medium/COl every 3 days. At the end of this period cell numbers were counted using a Coulter cell counter<br>
Stage 2<br>
After treatment of cells for a 6-day period with the COI cells are re-seeded at a density of 104 cells/well. No further treatments are added. Cells are allowed to continue to grow for a further 6 days in the presence of growth medium. At the end of this period cell numbers are again counted.<br>
CANCER<br>
As indicated, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of a cell cycling disorder A particular cell cycling disorder is cancer.<br>
Cancer remains a major cause of mortality in most Western countries. Cancer therapies developed so far have included blocking the action or synthesis of hormones to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent tumours. However, more aggressive chemotherapy is currently employed for the treatment of hormone-independent tumours.<br>
Hence, the development of a pharmaceutical for anti-cancer treatment of hormone dependent and/or hormone independent tumours, yet lacking some or all of the side-effects associated with chemotherapy, would represent a major therapeutic advance.<br>
It is known that oestrogens undergo a number of hydroxylation and conjugation reactions after their synthesis. Until recently it was thought that such reactions were part of a metabolic process that ultimately rendered oestrogens water soluble and enhanced their elimination from the body. It is now evident that some hydroxy metabolites (e.g. 2-hydroxy and 16alpha-hydroxy) and conjugates (e.g. oestrone sulphate, E1S) are important in determining some of the complex actions that oestrogens have in the body.<br>
Workers have investigated the formation of 2- and 16-hydroxylated oestrogens in relation to conditions that alter the risk of breast cancer. There is now evidence that factors which increase 2-hydroxylase activity are associated with a reduced cancer risk, while those increasing 16alpha-hydroxylation may enhance the risk of breast cancer. Further interest in the biological role of estrogen metabolites has been stimulated by the growing body of evidence that 2-methoxyoestradiol is an endogenous metabolite with anti-mitotic properties. 2-MeOE2 is formed from 2-hydroxy estradiol (2-OHE2) by catechol estrogen methyl transferase, an enzyme that is widely distributed throughout the body.<br>
Workers have shown that in vivo 2-MeOE2 inhibits the growth of tumours arising from the subcutaneous injection of Meth A sarcoma, B16 melanoma or MDA-MB-435 estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer cells. It also inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and in vitro angiogenesis. It was suggested that the ability of 2-MeOE2 to inhibit tumour growth in vivo may be due to its ability to inhibit tumour-induced angiogenesis rather than direct inhibition of the proliferation of tumour cells.<br>
The mechanism by which 2-MeOE2 exerts its potent anti-mitogenic and anti-angiogenic<br>
effects is still being elucidated. There is evidence that at high concentrations it can inhibit microtubule polymerisation and act as a weak inhibitor of colchicine binding to tubulin. Recently, however, at concentrations that block mitosis, tubulin filaments in cells were not found to be depolymerised but to have an identical morphology to that seen after taxol treatment. It is possible, therefore, that like taxol, a drug that is used for breast and ovarian breast cancer therapy, 2-MeOE2 acts by stabilising microtubule dynamics.<br>
While the identification of 2-MeOE2 as a new therapy for cancer represents an important advance, the bioavailability of orally administered oestrogens is poor. Furthermore, they can undergo extensive metabolism during their first pass through the liver. As part of a research programme to develop a steroid sulphatase inhibitor for breast cancer therapy, oestrone-3-O-sulphamate (EMATE) was identified as a potent active site-directed inhibitor. Unexpectedly, EMATE proved to possess potent oestrogenic properties with its oral uterotrophic activity in rats being a 100-times higher than that of estradiol. Its enhanced oestrogenicity is thought to result from its absorption by red blood cells (rbcs) which protects it from inactivation during its passage through the liver and which act as a reservoir for its slow release for a prolonged period of time. A number of A-ring modified analogues were synthesised and tested, including 2-methoxyoestrone-3-O-sulphamate. While this compound was equipotent with EMATE as a steroid sulphatase inhibitor, it was devoid of oestrogenicity.<br>
We believe that the compound of the present invention provides a means for the treatment of cancers and, especially, breast cancer.<br>
In addition or in the alternative the compound of the present invention may be useful in the blocking the growth of cancers including leukaemias and solid tumours such as breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and pancreatic tumours.<br>
THERAPY CONCERNING OESTROGEN<br>
We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the control of oestrogen levels in the body - in particular in females. Thus, some of the compounds may be useful as providing a means of fertility control - such as an oral contraceptive tablet, pill, solution or lozenge. Alternatively, the compound could be in the form of an implant or as a patch.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating hormonal<br>
conditions associated with oestrogen.<br>
In addition or in the alternative the compound of the present invention may be useful in treating hormonal conditions in addition to those associated with oestrogen. Hence, the compound of the present invention may also be capable of affecting hormonal activity and may also be capable of affecting an immune response.<br>
NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES<br>
We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and similar conditions.<br>
By way of example, it is believed that STS inhibitors may be useful in the enhancing the memory function of patients suffering from illnesses such as amnesia, head injuries, Alzheimer's disease, epileptic dementia, presenile dementia, post traumatic dementia, senile dementia, vascular dementia and post-stroke dementia or individuals otherwise seeking memory enhancement.<br>
TH1<br>
We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in TH1 implications.<br>
By way of example, it is believed that the presence of STS inhibitors within the macrophage or other antigen presenting cells may lead to a decreased ability of sensitised T cells to mount a TH1 (high IL-2, IFN^ low IL-4) response. The normal regulatory influence of other steroids such as glucocorticoids would therefore predominate.<br>
INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS<br>
We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating inflammatory conditions - such as conditions associated with any one or more of: autoimmunity, including for example, rheumatoid arthritis, type I and II diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, thyroiditis, vasculitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, skin disorders e.g. psoriasis and contact dermatitis; graft versus host disease; eczema; asthma and organ rejection following transplantation.<br>
By way of example, it is believed that STS inhibitors may prevent the normal physiological effect of DHEA or related steroids on immune and/or inflammatory responses.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be useful in the manufacture of a medicament for revealing an endogenous glucocorticoid-like effect.<br>

COMPOUND PREPARATION<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by reacting an appropriate alcohol with a suitable chloride. By way of example, the sulphamate compounds of the present invention may be prepared by reacting an appropriate alcohol with a suitable sulfamoyl chloride, of the formula R5R6NSO2CI.<br>
Typical conditions for carrying out the reaction are as follows.<br>
Sodium hydride and a sulfamoyl chloride are added to a stirred solution of the alcohol in anhydrous dimethyl formamide at 0°C. Subsequently, the reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature whereupon stirring is continued for a further 24 hours. The reaction mixture is poured onto a cold saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate and the resulting aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Filtration followed by solvent evaporation in vacuo and co-evaporated with toluene affords a crude residue which is further purified by flash chromatography.Preferably, the alcohol is derivatised, as appropriate, prior to reaction with the sulfamoyl chloride. Where necessary, functional groups in the alcohol may be protected in known manner and the protecting group or groups removed at the end of the reaction.<br>

Inhibition of taxol-induced microtubule polymerization<br>
The ability of drugs to inhibit taxol-induced polymerisation of tubulin was measured by turbidity at 350nm. Tubulin (Cryoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO), at a final concentration of 1mg/ml was incubated at 32°C in G-PEM buffer [80mM piperazine-N,N-bis (2-ethane sulfonic acid) sequisodium salt, 1mM MgCI2, 1mM EGTA and 1mM GTP (pH 6.8)] in the presence of taxol with or without estrone derivatives [20µM ].<br>
Figure 3 shows the inhibition of taxol-induced polymerisation of tubulin by STX641 and related compounds. STX641 is thought to act as an anti-microtubule agent, i.e. to disrupt microtubule function. To show this, tubulin was incubated in the presence of taxol (a compound known to promote tubulin polymerisation). Taxol induced efficient in vitro microtubule assembly as reflected in the increase in turbidity as measured at 350nm.<br>
Addition of STX641 , STX 505, STX564 or STX640 to the tubulin and taxol reaction<br>
fixture effectively blocked tubulin assembly with little increase in turbidity being detected. These results show that STX641 and related compounds inhibit tubulin polymerisation in vitro and that such compounds are likely to disrupt microtubule dynamics in vivo (and hence tumour growth).<br>
Inhibition of Glucose Uptake<br>
To measure the inhibition of glucose uptake into cells, cells were plated into 12-well multi-well plates and grown to confluence. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 15min in incubation buffer containing 1VCi 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H] glucose (NEN-Dupont, UK) per well in the absence or presence of potential inhibitors (0.1 - 10µM). Uptake was terminated by washing the cells in cold (4°C) PBS. The cells were solubilized in Triton-X in 0.01M sodium hydroxide and processed for liquid scintillation counting (Singh et al., Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology, 160: 61-66, 2000).<br><br>

Figure 4 shows the inhibition of glucose uptake. An increased uptake of glucose (as an energy source) is a characteristic feature of most cancer cells. Glucose is taken up into cells by a number of glucose transporters and one such transporter (GLUT 1) is over-expressed in malignant breast tissues. Figure 4 shows that STX641 (and related compounds) inhibits glucose uptake by MCF-7 (oestrogen receptor positive, ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-) breast cancer cells. Inhibition of glucose uptake in vivo should inhibit tumour growth and this may be an important mechanism by which STX641 and related compounds will act to inhibit tumour growth in patients.<br>
Effects on Tubule Formation<br>
The effects of drugs on tubule formation (measured as a marker of their anti-angiogenic potential) was assessed using an Angiogenesis kit (TCS-Cellworks Ltd (Bucks, UK).  For<br>
this, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in a 24-well plate<br>
within a matrix of human diploid fibroblasts of dermal origin. The co-cultured cells were incubated throughout the experiment at 37°C under 5% C02 in a humidified incubator. On day 1, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium containing the drugs under investigation. On days 4, 7 and 9, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the drugs under investigation. On day 11, the cells were washed with PBS and 70% ethanol (1ml) added to each well for 30min to fix the cells. After fixation, the cells were washed with blocking buffer (1ml PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin, Sigma, UK) and stained with either von Willebrand's factor or CD31. The extent of tubule formation was quantified by manual scoring or by computer analysis. Images were captured using a Kodak DC120 digital camera. In addition, details of changes in tubule formation induced by drugs were also recorded by high definition scanning of plates with some of the scans being presented as Photoshop processed images.<br>
Most solid tumours can only grow beyond 1-2mm in size if they develop a blood vessel network so that they can obtain essential nutrients to support their growth (a process known as angiogenesis). Drugs that block this angiogenic process should therefore inhibit the growth of a wide range of solid tumours.<br>
In this assay, the ability of STX641 (and related compounds) to act as an inhibitor of angiogenesis was examined using a co-culture of HUVECs and dermal fibroblasts. In this system, the endothelial cells initially form small islands within the fibroblast matrix. They subsequently proliferate and enter a migratory phase during which they move through the matrix to form thread-like tubule structures. These coalesce to form a network of anastomosing tubules. Representative figures showing the effects of STX641 on tubule formation are shown in Figures 5 and 6. In Figure 5, for untreated (control) co-cultures of HUVECs and dermal fibroblasts, the thread-like nature of the extensive tubule network is clearly visible. In contrast, for co-cultured cells treated with STX641 (0.1µM) the tubules have been completely destroyed showing that this drug has potent anti-angiogenic properties. In Figure 6, plates have been recorded by high definition scanning and also processed to give pixalated images. Again, the thread-like tubules are clearly visible for the untreated (control) co-cultures whereas STX641 (and STX140) at 0.05µM completely abolish tubule formation.<br>
The extent of inhibition of tubule formation can be quantified by computer analysis (Figure 7).  As shown STX641, STX564 and STX639 at 0.05µM and 0.1µM completely inhibited<br>
tubule formation confirming the anti-angiogenic potential of these compounds.<br>

In each case the calibration was 1.0 pixels and the image area was 3211216.  VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor.<br>
These data are displayed in Figure 11. Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells<br>
Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis was performed on 40% confluent populations of MCF-7s with 500nM of compound.<br>
At 8h STX 140, STX 640 and STX 641 induced significant G2/M arrest compared to control (16% to27%).<br>
After 24h of STX 641 exposure, 68% of cells were G2/M arrested compared to control (28%), STX 140 (28%) and STX 640 (18%). This increase in the population of G2/M cells was accompanied by a decrease in G1- and S-phase populations (37% to 15%, and 30% to 9% respectively). In STX 140 treated cells, a significant increase in the sub-G1 population was observed, normally indicative of apoptosis (36%, compared to 2% in control cells).<br>
After 48h, STX 641-treated cells were still G2/M-arrested with no significant increase in the apoptotic sub-G1 population. Cells treated with STX 140 continued to show an increasing population of sub-G1 cells.<br>

Figure 12 shows the effect of STX 641 at a concentration of 1µM on A2780 ovarian cancer cells, showing G2/M arrest induced by STX 641 after 24 hours (left hand graphs) The right hand graphs show the results of FACs analysis for cells stained with annexin V antibody. For controls, there is no cell surface expression as indicated by a lack of a peak in the M2 region. In contrast, STX 641 treated cells showed a marked increase in staining for this apoptopic marker, as indicated by the increase in the M2 region, showing that the compound induces apoptosis.<br>

MCF-7 Breast Cancer Nude Mouse Model<br>
Adult female ICRF nude (nu/nu) mice were injected with 10x106 MCF-7 cells/0.1ml Matrigel s.c and tumour growth was monitored weekly. When tumours reached 100-150mm3 in volume, the mice were divided into the following groups:<br>
A:        Control	vehicle 0.1 ml p.o for 5 times a week for a period of 3 weeks<br>
B:        STX 140         20mg/kg p.o for 5 times a week for a period of 3 weeks<br>
 C:        STX 641         20mg/kg p.o for 5 times a week for a period of 3 weeks<br>
The mice were injected intravenously with 0.1ml of 25mg/ml FITC-Dextran solution 20 minutes prior to killing to allow the visualisation and quantification of tumour angiogenesis.<br>
The results of this study are shown in the following figures.<br>
Figure 13 shows the effect of STX 140 and STX 641 (20mg/kg p.o) on the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cell tumours in ICRF nude mice.<br>
STX 140 resulted in 59% tumour regression and STX 641 gave 25% tumour regression over the 3 week dosing period.<br><br>
Figure 14 shows fluorescent photographs showing effects of STX 140 and STX 641 (20 mg/kg p.o) treatment on tumour vasculature.<br>
FITC imaging of tumours revealed controls to have well defined structured vasculature, whereas in STX 140 and STX 641 treated animals the tumour vasculature was disrupted and ill defined.<br>
Figure 15 shows the effect of STX-140 and STX641 (20mg/kg) on tumour angiogenesis in MCF-7 breast tumours.<br>
FITC quantification of tumour angiogenesis showed both STX 140 and STX 641 produced significant inhibition of 40% and 60% of tumour angiogenesis respectively.<br>
Figure 16 shows the effect of STX 140 and 641 (20mg/kg op) on liver and tumour sulphatase activity in nude mice.<br>
Liver sulphatase activity was nearly completely inhibited by both STX 140 and STX 641.<br>
