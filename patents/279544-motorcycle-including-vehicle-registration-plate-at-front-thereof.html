10<br>
is inclined at least at an angle θ1 with respect to the vertical line V. When viewed from a lateral side of the motorcycle, the vehicle registration plate 13 is inclined backward at an angle θ2 with respect to the vertical line V. The angle θ2 is smaller than the angle θ1. More specifically, the vehicle registration plate 13 is provided substantially in the vertical direction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, when viewed from a lateral side of the motorcycle, the vehicle registration plate 13 is provided above the side cover 19. Therefore, the vehicle registration plate 13 may be provided as near as possible to the head pipe 2a.<br>
Headlight Stay<br>
The motorcycle 1 further includes a headlight stay 16 and a meter bracket 15 shown in Figs. 15 to 17. As shown in Fig. 4, the headlight stay 16 is a component used to attach the headlight unit 12 to the front fork 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, the headlight stay 16 includes a pair of right and left round rods 16a and a coupling plate 16b. The round rods 16a extend in the vertical direction. The coupling plate 16b is fixed at the lower ends of the round rods 16a. The connecting rod 15e of the meter bracket 15 that will be described is welded to the upper ends of the round rods 16a. The headlight stay 16 and the meter bracket 15 have substantially a rectangular shape when viewed from the front. The round rods 16a have their upper ends bent backward to form engagement portions 16c. As shown in Fig. 4, the lower surface of the upper bracket 6c of the front fork 6 has an engagement recess 6f. The engagement portion 16c is secured to the engagement recess 6f through a damper 17. The coupling<br>
11<br>
plate 16b is fixed to the lower bracket 6d of the front fork 6 by a bolt 16d. In this way, the headlight stay 16 is attached to the front fork 6.<br>
As shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the headlight stay 16 further includes a pair of right and left support members 16e. As shown in Fig. 4, attachment members 18a are provided in the right and left parts of the headlight 18. A bolt 16f is inserted laterally into the attachment hole of the attachment member 18a and screwed to the support member 16e of the headlight stay 16.<br>
As shown in Figs. 15 to 17, the headlight stay 16 further includes a pair of right and left support members 16g. As shown in Fig. 4, an adjuster 18b is formed in the left part of the bottom of the headlight 18. The adjuster 18b is attached to the support member 16g of the headlight stay 16 by a bolt 16h. The bolt 16h is inserted laterally in an elongate hole formed in the adjuster 18b and screwed to the support member 16g of the headlight stay 16. When the bolt 16h is loosened, the entire headlight unit 12 can be rotated around the bolt 16f. In this way, the optical axis of the headlight 18 can be adjusted.<br>
Meter Bracket<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the meter bracket 15 is a component used to attach the meter unit 11 to the front fork 6. As shown in Fig. 18, the meter bracket 15 includes a front side 15a and a pair of right and left sides 15b. The meter bracket 15 is made of a sheet metal and substantially C-shaped when viewed in a plan view.<br>
As shown in Figs. 15, 16, and 18, the meter bracket 15 further includes a pair of right and left connecting rods 15e. The connecting rods 15e are welded to the upper ends<br>
12<br>
of the round rods 16a of the headlight stay 16, so that the meter bracket 15 is coupled to the headlight stay 16.<br>
As shown in Figs. 15 and 18, attachment holes 15c are formed at the central part of the front side 15a and the rear ends of the sides 15b. As shown in Fig. 4, a bolt 15d is inserted into the attachment hole 15c from below and fastened to the bottom of the meter case 11a. In this way, the meter unit 11 is attached to the meter bracket 15. Therefore, the meter unit 11 is attached to the front fork 6 through the meter bracket 15 and the headlight stay 16.<br>
Visor Bracket<br>
The motorcycle 1 further includes a visor bracket 23 shown in Figs. 19 and 20. As shown in Fig. 4, the visor bracket 23 is a component used to attach the meter visor 14 to the meter bracket 15.<br>
As shown in Figs. 19 and 20, the visor bracket 23 includes a pair of right and left support members 23a, a pair of right and left coupling members 23b, and a coupling member 23c used to couple them. The support members 23a each have two collars 23d used to attach the vehicle registration plate 13 and the meter visor 14. The coupling members 23b each have an attachment hole 23f. A bolt 23e is inserted into the attachment hole 23f of the visor bracket 23 from below and screwed to the screw hole 15f of the bracket 15. In this way, the visor bracket 23 is attached to the meter bracket 15.<br>
13<br>
Plate Bracket<br>
The motorcycle 1 further includes a plate bracket 22 as shown in Figs. 21 and 22. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the plate bracket 22 is a component used to attach the vehicle registration plate 13 to the meter visor 14.<br>
As shown in Figs. 21 and 22, the plate bracket 22 includes a plate attachment portion 22a, a pair of right and left legs 22b, and a pair of right and left coupling members 22c. The plate attachment member 22a is a strip shaped plate that extends in the motorcycle widthwise direction. The plate attachment portion 22a has two screw holes 22f in the right and the left parts. The right and left ends of the plate attachment portion 22a are bent backward to form the legs 22b. The legs 22b are further bent outward in the motorcycle widthwise direction to form the coupling members 22c. The coupling members 22c each have two attachment holes 22g.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 to 6, bolts 22e are inserted into the attachment holes (not shown) of the vehicle registration plate 13 from the front and screwed to the screw holes 22f of the plate bracket 22. Therefore, the vehicle registration plate 13 is attached to the plate bracket 22 by the bolts 22e.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 to 6, bolts 22d are inserted into the attachment holes 22g (Figs. 21 to 22) of the plate bracket 22 from above and further into the attachment holes 14b (Figs. 13 and 14) of the meter visor 14 and screwed to the collars 23d (Figs. 19 and 20) of the visor bracket 23. Therefore, the plate bracket 22 and the meter visor 14 are attached to the visor bracket 23 by the bolts 22d. As a result, the vehicle registration plate 13 is attached to the front fork 6 through the plate bracket 22, the visor bracket 23,<br>
14<br>
and the headlight stay 16. The meter visor 14 is attached to the front fork 6 through the visor bracket 23 and the headlight stay 16.<br>
As described above, the meter unit 11, the headlight unit 12, the vehicle registration plate 13, and the meter visor 14 are attached to the headlight stay 16 to form a unit and attached to the front fork 6 together as the unit.<br>
Effects of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
According to the present preferred embodiment, the vehicle registration plate 13 is attached above the meter visor 14, so that the vehicle registration plate 13 does not come within sight of the rider. Furthermore, the vehicle registration plate 13 does not get in the way, when the headlight unit 12 and the meter unit 11 are positioned close to the center of gravity of the motorcycle 1.<br>
The meter visor 14 overlaps the vehicle registration plate 13 in the center of the motorcycle widthwise direction from a view point in the orthogonal direction XII to the meter panel 11b. Therefore, if light from the light bulb 181 of the headlight 18 is reflected by the back surface of the vehicle registration plate 13, the light hardly comes in the rider’s eyes.<br>
The lower portion 14c of the meter visor 14 is positioned in front of the vehicle registration plate 13. Therefore, light from the headlight 18 is shielded by the lower portion 14c of the meter visor 14 and unlikely to reach the back surface of the vehicle registration plate 13.<br>
The size L2 of the meter visor 14 in the motorcycle widthwise direction is equal to or larger than the size L1 of the vehicle registration plate 13 in the motorcycle<br>
15<br>
widthwise direction. Therefore, if light from the headlight 18 is reflected by the back surface of the vehicle registration plate 13, the light hardly comes in the rider’s eyes.<br>
When viewed from a lateral side of the motorcycle, the central line C of the transparent cover 18f of the headlight 18 in the motorcycle widthwise direction is inclined at an angle θ1 or more with respect to the vertical line V, and the vehicle registration plate 13 is inclined backward at an angle θ2 that is smaller than the angle θ1 with respect to the vertical line V. Therefore, light from the headlight 18 hardly reaches the back surface of the vehicle registration plate 13.<br>
When viewed from a lateral side of the motorcycle, the meter visor 14 overlaps the front portion 11” of the meter unit 11, and sunlight hardly reaches the meter panel 11b.<br>
Since the rear end 11” of the meter unit 11 is positioned substantially immediately above the lower end 2a’ of the head pipe 2a, the meter unit 11 may be provided close to the center of gravity of the motorcycle 1.<br>
The headlight unit 12, the meter unit 11, and the meter visor 14 are attached to the headlight stay 16, and the vehicle registration plate 13 is attached above the meter visor 14. Therefore, these four components 11 to 14 may be attached to the head stay 16 in advance to form a unit and may be attached to the front fork 6 together as the unit. Furthermore, when the handle 7 is turned to the right or left, the four components 11 to 14 are turned together with the front fork 6, and therefore these four components 11 to 14 do not collide against one another.<br>
When viewed from the front of the motorcycle, the lower portion 14c of the meter visor 14 overlaps the recesses 20d of the top cover 20. Therefore, the top cover 20 does<br>
16<br>
not get in the way when the meter visor 14 is positioned close to the center of gravity of the motorcycle 1.<br>
When viewed from a lateral side of the motorcycle, the rear end 19’ of the side cover 19 is provided above the lower end 2a’ of the head pipe 2a, and the meter visor 14 and the vehicle registration plate 13 are provided above the side cover 19. Therefore, the side cover 19, the meter visor 14, and the vehicle registration plate 13 may be provided close to the center of gravity of the motorcycle 1.<br>
