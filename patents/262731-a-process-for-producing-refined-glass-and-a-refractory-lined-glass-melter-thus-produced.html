				<td>This invention also relates to a glass melting process using at least one oxygen-fuel<br>
burner in the roof of the glass melting furnace to melt raw glass-forming material also<br>
known as batch. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to a glass melting process using at least one oxygen-fuel burner in the<br>
roof of the glass melting furnace for melting raw glass-forming material without the use<br>
of regenerators or recuperators to improve the rate of melting and the quality of glass<br>
products.<br>
	Regenerative or recuperative furnaces having melting and fining zones have been<br>
commonly employed to manufacture glass. The regenerative or recuperative furnaces.<br>
unlike other types of furnaces, employ at least one regenerator or recuperator in operating<br>
air-fuel burners. At least one regenerator or recuperator, which may come in many<br>
different shapes and sizes, serves to preheat air used in the air-fuel burners. In the<br>
regenerator the preheating is generally accomplished by transferring the heat in the<br>
existing waste gas from a melting chamber to refractory bricks stacked in a checkerboard<br>
fashion. The bricks, in turn, give up their heat to the incoming air which will be used in<br>
combusting the fuel. Commonly, the recuperator may consist generally of a double wall<br>
tubing in which the off gas from the melting chamber flows in the central tube either<br>
countercurrent or concurrent to the air which is passing through the annulus. The<br>
performance of the regenerator or recuperator, however, may deteriorate with time<br>
because the regenerator or recuperator may be partially plugged or destroyed when it is<br>
subject to the waste gas containing chemical contaminants for a long period. The partially<br>
plugged or destroyed regenerator or recuperator adversely affects the performance of air-<br>
fuel burners, thereby decreasing the glass production rate and fuel efficiency.<br>
It has been known, therefore, to employ oxygen-fuel burners, in a number of<br>
furnaces to supplement or totally replace the air-fuel burners. The oxygen-fuel burners<br>
have been designed to produce a flame and heat transfer similar to that of convention air-<br><br>
fuel burners. Specifically, the oxygen fuel burners are designed to fire parallel or<br>
substantially parallel to the surface of the glass. These burners transfer heat upward into<br>
the furnace crown and surrounding refractories as well as into the glass. Heat transfer is<br>
achieved by direct radiation from the flame and by re-radiation from the refractory<br>
superstructure of the glass furnace. Little heat is transferred to the glass by convection or<br>
conduction. The capacity of the glass furnace is limited by the highest refractory<br>
temperature within the melting chamber. Accordingly, one concern in the use of oxygen-<br>
fuel burners has been the risk associated with the high temperature of the burners and<br>
overheating of the refractory roof and walls of the furnace. Examples of furnaces utilizing<br>
oxygen-fuel burners firing generally parallel to the glass surface are described in US<br>
Patents 4,531,960 and 5,500,030.<br><br>
The present invention utilizes the higher flame temperature and lower mass flow<br>
rate achievable with oxygen-fuel combustion to significantly increase the heat transfer<br>
into the glass while maintaining refractory temperatures within operating limits. This is<br>
accomplished by utilizing at least one oxygen-fuel burner firing perpendicular or<br>
substantially perpendicular to the glass surface rather than in the conventional parallel<br>
configuration. By firing the burners perpendicular to the glass surface the convective and<br>
radiant properties of the flame are utilized to transfer energy to the raw glass-forming<br>
material rather than radiant heat transfer only. Accordingly, the luminosity and high<br>
temperature portion of the flame is placed in close proximity if not in direct contact with<br>
the raw glass-forming material to increase heat transfer via radiation. With radiation<br>
being an exponential function of distance from the heat source, the heat transfer by<br>
radiation is much greater in the glass melting furnace in accordance with the present<br>
invention than conventional furnaces. In addition, the impingement of the high<br>
temperature flame onto the raw glass forming material substantially increases the heat<br>
transfer via convection at the area of impingement of the flame. Consequently, the<br>
increased rate of heat transfer to the glass and batch results in a very substantial increase<br>
in the rate of melting and fining the glass. Furthermore, because the majority of the heat<br>
transfer is directly from the higher temperature impinging flame and not from the<br>
refractory, the melting capacity of the glass furnace is increased, without thermal<br>
deterioration of the refractory.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to increase the melting capacity of a<br>
glass furnace without increasing the risk of overheating the roof and walls of the furnace.<br>
It is another object of the invention to maintain a particular glass production rate without<br><br>
The invention achieves its advantageous effects by utilizing an oxygen-fuel burner<br>
designed to enable control of the velocities of the gaseous fuel and of the oxygen from the<br>
vurner whereby the velocities are substantially equivalent to provide generally laminar<br>
gaseous fuel and oxygen flow to combust proximate the surface of the raw glass-forming<br>
material. This is to be contrasted with the arrangement described in US Patent 3,337,324.<br>
Accordingly, the invention seeks to increase the melting capacity of a glass<br>
furnace without increasing the risk of overheating the roof and walls of the furnace and to<br>
maintain a particular glass production rate without the use of regenerators or recuperators.<br>
It seeks further reduce the formation of NOx during the glass melting, to reduce the size<br>
of glass furnace required per given capacity over a conventional air-fuel glass furnace or a<br>
conventional oxygen-fuel glass furnace, to reduce the total energy required per ton of<br>
glass melted over conventional air-fuel glass furnaces, and to permit better utilization of<br>
capacity and more flexibility of operation thus reducing melter capital cost per ton of glass<br>
produced.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, there is now provided a process for producing<br>
refined glass from raw glass-forming material in a refractory lined glass melter without<br>
the use of regenerators or recuperators, the glass melter having a roof connected to a<br>
bottom by side walls and defining therebetween an elongated channel having a melting<br>
zone and a downstream fining zone, the process comprising the steps of:<br>
charging raw glass-forming material to the melting zone of the glass melter;<br>
providing at least one oxygen-fuel burner recessed within a burner block in the<br>
roof of the glass melter and arranged to fire perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to<br>
the surface of the raw glass-forming material, the oxygen-fuel burner having an inner<br>

to reduce the size of glass furnace required per given capacity over a conventional air-fuel<br>
glass furnace or a conventional oxygen-fuel glass furnace. Still another object of the<br>
present invention is to reduce the total energy required per ton of glass melted over<br>

a glass furnace that permits better utilization of capacity and more flexibility of operation<br>

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, according to the present invention there is provided a refractory lined<br>
glass melter for producing refined glass from raw glass-forming material. The glass<br>
melter includes a roof connected to a bottom by side walls and defining an elongated<br>
channel having a melting zone and a downstream fining zone and at least one oxygen-fuel<br>
burner located within the roof of the glass melter. The oxygen-fuel burner has an inner<br>
central cylindrical fuel conduit for providing gaseous fuel and an outer cylindrical oxygen<br>
conduit concentric with the central fuel outlet for providing oxygen. The burner is<br>
designed so as to control the velocity of the gaseous fuel and the oxygen from the oxygen-<br>
fuel burner such that the velocity of the gaseous fuel and the oxygen are substantially<br>
equivalent to provide a generally laminar gaseous fuel and oxygen flow to combust<br>
proximate a top surface of the raw glass-forming material and produce a flame which<br>
impinges the surface of the raw glass-forming material and which has a middle portion of<br>
a columnar shape.<br>
The present invention also includes a process for producing refined glass from raw glass-<br>
forming material in the refractory lined glass melter. The process includes the steps of<br>
charging raw glass-forming material to the melting zone of the glass melter and providing<br>
at least one oxygen-fuel burner within the roof of the glass melter having an inner central<br>
cylindrical gaseous fuel conduit for providing gaseous fuel and an outer cylindrical<br>
oxygen conduit concentric with the central fuel outlet for providing oxygen. The velocity<br>
of the gaseous fuel and the oxygen from the oxygen-fuel burner is controlled such that the<br>
velocity of the gaseous fuel and the oxygen are substantially equivalent to provide a<br>
generally laminar gaseous fuel flow and generally laminar oxygen flow to combust<br><br>

Referring to the figures, there is shown a glass melting furnace 10 for providing<br>
molten glass to a glass forehearth 12 wherein the molten glass is further refined and<br>
subsequently fed to one or more glass-forming machines such as containers, fiberizers and<br>
the like (not shown). In considering the figures, it will be appreciated that for purposes of<br>
clarity certain details of construction are not provided in view of such details being<br><br>
conventional and well within the skill of the art once the invention is disclosed and<br>
explained.<br>
The glass melting furnace 10 typically includes an elongated channel having an<br>
upstream end wall 14 and a downstream end wall 16, side walls 18, a floor 20 and a roof<br>
22 all made from appropriate refractory materials such as alumina, silica, alumina-silica.<br>
zircon, zirconia-alumina-silica and the like. The roof 22 is shown generally as having an<br>
arcuate shape transverse to the longitudinal axis of the channel, however, the roof may be<br>
of most any suitable design. The roof 22 of the glass melting furnace 10 is positioned<br>
between 9.9-300m about 3-10 feet above the surface of the raw glass-forming material. As well<br>
known in the art, the glass melting furnace 10 may optionally include one or more<br>
bubblers 24 and/or electrical boost electrodes. The bubblers and/or electrical boost<br>
electrodes increase the temperature of the bulk glass and increase the molten glass<br>
circulation under the batch cover.<br>
The glass melting furnace 10 includes two successive zones, a melting zone 26<br>
and a downstream fining zone 28. The melting zone 26 is considered the upstream zone<br>
of the glass melting furnace 10 wherein raw glass-forming material 30 is charged into the<br>
furnace using a charging device 32 of a type well known in the art. The raw glass-<br>
forming material 30 may be a mixture of raw materials typically used in the manufacture<br>
of glass. It will be appreciated that the raw glass-forming material 30 make-up is<br>
dependent on the type of glass being produced. Normally, the material comprises, inter<br>
alia, silica containing materials including finely ground scrap glass commonly referred to<br>
as cullet. Other glass-forming materials including feldspar, limestone, dolomite, soda ash,<br>
potash, borax and alumina may also be used. To alter the properties of the glass, a minor<br>
amount of arsenic, antimony, sulfates, carbon and/or fluorides may also be added.<br>
Moreover, color forming metal oxides may be added to obtain the desired color.<br>
The raw glass-forming material 30 forms a batch layer of solid particles on the<br>
surface of the molten glass in the melting zone 26 of the glass melting furnace 10. The<br>
floating solid batch particles of raw glass-forming material 30 are melted principally by at<br>
least one oxygen-fuel burner 34 having a controlled impinging flame shape and length<br>
mounted within the roof 22 of the glass melting furnace 10. It will be appreciated that it<br>
has been found that the installation of at least one oxygen-fuel burner 34 in the roof 22 of<br>
the glass melting furnace 10 over the raw glass-forming material 30 in accordance with<br><br>
the present invention increases the melting rate of the solid raw glass-forming material<br>
and, at the same time, maintains the operating temperature of the surrounding refractory<br>
material within acceptable operating limits.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "at least one oxygen-fuel burner" means one or more<br>
oxygen fuel burners. Furthermore, as used herein the phrase "principally by at least one<br>
oxygen-fuel burner" refers to the condition wherein at least 70% of the energy for melting<br>
of the raw glass-forming material is from at least one oxygen-fuel burner.<br>
In one particular embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 4, the glass melting<br>
furnace 10 includes three oxygen-fuel burners 34. A single oxygen-fuel burner 34 is<br>
positioned upstream of two adjacently positioned downstream oxygen-fuel burners.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that any number of oxygen-fuel burners 34 may be<br>
positioned at most any suitable location in the roof 22 of the furnace 10 over the batch to<br>
melt the raw glass-forming material 30. For example, two oxygen-fuel burners 34 may be<br>
positioned in a side-by-side relation (FIG. 3) or a single oxygen-fuel burner may be used<br>
(FIG. 4). Nonetheless, in accordance with the present invention, the angular orientation of<br>
each oxygen-fuel burner 34 in the roof 22 of the glass melting furnace must be such that<br>
the flame 36 produced is directed substantially perpendicular to the glass batch surface to<br>
produce a flame which impinges on the glass surface. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
oxygen-fuel burners 34 are positioned at an angle of about 90 +/- 10 degrees relative to<br>
the raw glass-forming material 30. It has been found that the glass production rate and the<br>
quality of glass produced may be improved by melting the raw glass-forming material 30<br>
with at least one downwardly firing oxygen-fuel burner 34 having a controlled impinging<br>
flame shape and length in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the at least one oxygen-fuel burner 34 within the roof 22 of<br>
the glass melting furnace 10 has an inner central cylindrical gaseous fuel conduit 40 for<br>
providing gaseous fuel and an outer cylindrical oxygen conduit 42 concentric with the<br>
central fuel outlet for providing oxygen flow. The oxygen-fuel burner 34 may have a<br>
capacity ranging from about 1-10 MM Btu/hr depending upon the glass melting furnace<br>
10 size and desired pull rate. The oxygen-fuel burner 34 is designed to use a higher<br>
percentage of oxygen than is present in air and thus the temperature above the area of<br>
impingement of the flame 36 from the oxygen-fuel burner 34 is substantially higher than<br>
in a conventional glass melting furnace utilizing air-fuel burners. Notwithstanding, as<br><br>
well known to one skilled in the art the temperature of the flame 36 imparted by an<br>
oxygen-fuel burner 34 is dependent on the quality of the fuel and the oxygen/fuel ratio. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the oxygen concentration of the oxygen-fuel burner 34 is<br>
typically at a level of about 95 - 125 percent of the stoichiometric amount of oxygen<br>
required to combust the fuel. However, the fuel to oxygen ratio can be varied to produce<br>
a range of operating conditions in the glass melting furnace 10 to effect one or more<br>
desired properties, including, for example, redox level, seed level and/or most any other<br>
glass property.<br>
The oxygen-fuel burner 34 extends downwardly from a burner block 38 located in the<br>
roof 22 of the glass melting furnace 10. Each burner block 38 includes an opening having<br>
an inside diameter (id) which is at least as great as the external diameter of the cylindrical<br>
oxygen conduit 42. The inside diameter (id) of the opening of the burner block 38 may<br><br>
range between 50-200mm about 2-8 inches. The end of the oxygen-fuel burner 34 is recessed from<br>
the end of the burner block 38 a distance (LBb) between 75-450mm about 3-18 inches. It will be<br>
appreciated that the opening of the burner block 38 between the end of the oxygen-fuel<br>
burner 34 and the end of the burner block acts to focus the burner flame and prevent the<br>
burner flame from spreading outwardly. The burner block 38 is made of a refractor.<br>
material as well known in the art and may be of most any suitable shape such as<br>
rectangular and the like.<br>
The bottom surface of the burner block 38 may be flush with the inside surface of<br>
the roof 22 or the bottom surface may project below the inside surface of the roof from 2 -<br>
18 inches to protect the roof and promote the formation of the impinging flame pattern<br>
having a controlled flame velocity at the point of impingement on the raw glass forming<br>
material. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 5, the fuel conduit 40 and oxygen conduit 42 of<br>
the oxygen-fuel burner 34 extend downwardly within the burner block 38 and terminate at<br>
substantially the same vertical height from the surface of the raw glass-forming material<br>
30.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the downwardly directed impinging<br>
flame 36 produced by the at least one oxygen-fuel burner 34 is precisely controlled to<br>
direct heat energy toward the raw glass-forming ingredients 30 and the surface of the<br>
molten glass and away from the surrounding refractory thereby reducing the risk of<br>
overheating the roof 22 and side walls 18 of the glass melting furnace 10. The impinging<br><br>
flame 36 may be controlled by such control devices as are conventional and standard in<br>
chemical processing. For example, valves, thermocouples, thermistors coupled with<br>
suitable servo circuits, heater controllers and the like are readily available and<br>
conventionally used for controlling the quantity and velocity of the fuel and oxygen from<br>
the oxygen-fuel burner 34. The resulting temperature profile produced within the glass<br>
melting furnace 10 is generally more uniform throughout the length of the glass melting<br>
furnace as opposed to a glass melting furnace employing air-fuel burners or a<br>
conventional oxygen-fuel furnace with oxygen-fuel burners placed in the side walls firing<br>
parallel 4o the surface of the glass. Typically, the temperature within the glass melting<br>
furnace 10 employing at least one oxygen-fuel burner 34 varies between 1260-1704oC aboul 2300 -<br>
3100 degrees Fahrenheit. The impinging flame 36 is precisely controlled by controlling<br>
both the relative velocity and the maximum and minimum velocities of the fuel and of the<br>
oxygen from the at least one oxygen-fuel burner 34.<br>
The relative velocity, i.e., the velocities of the gaseous fuel and the oxygen, must<br>
be substantially equivalent to provide a generally laminar gaseous fuel flow and generally<br>
laminar oxygen flow downward to the surface of the raw glass-forming material 30. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the relative velocity of the gaseous fuel and the oxygen from the<br>
oxygen-fuel burner 34 may vary from one another by no more than about 20%.<br>
Furthermore, the maximum difference between the oxygen and fuel flow velocity at the<br>
exit of the oxygen-fuel burner 34 may not exceed 15.25m about 50 standard feet per second. It<br>
will be appreciated that the laminar fuel flow and oxygen flow prevents premature mixing<br>
of the fuel and oxygen to allow for delayed mixing and combustion proximate a top<br>
surface of the raw glass-forming material 30 to produce a flame 36 which has a middle<br>
portion of an approximately columnar shape and which impinges the surface of the raw<br>
glass-forming material thereby providing optimum heat transfer to the raw glass-forming<br>
material. The "middle portion" refers to the free jet region 54 as further described herein.<br>
In addition to providing substantially equivalent oxygen and fuel flow velocity,<br>
the maximum and minimum velocity of the fuel and oxygen flow impinging on the<br>
surface of the raw glass-forming material 30 must be controlled to prevent the entrainment<br>
of or the displacement of glass batch material against the side walls 18 and roof 22 while<br>
maintaining optimum convective heat transfer to the surface of the raw glass-forming<br>
material. It will be appreciated that the displacement of glass batch material against the<br><br>
side walls 18 and roof 22 will adversely effect the refractory material and possibly shorten<br>
the operating life of the glass melting furnace 10.<br>
The maximum and minimum velocity of the fuel and of the oxygen of the oxygen-<br>
fuel burner 34 are also controlled to harness the maximum energy from the impinging<br>
flame 36 without damaging the surrounding refractory material. The maximum energy<br>
from the impinging flame 36 is achieved by minimizing the amount of heat released to the<br>
glass melting furnace 10 combustion space and maximizing the heat transfer to the raw-<br>
glass forming material 30. The operational maximum and minimum velocity range for<br>
the oxygen-fuel burner 34 to generate an acceptable heat transfer rate to the raw glass-<br>
forming material 30 without damaging the refractory material furnace walls and<br>
 superstructure is a function of the concentric tube-in-tube design of the oxygen-fuel<br>
burner, burner block opening geometry and the velocities of the fuel and oxygen from the<br>
oxygen-fuel burner 34.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a chart is shown including an upper operating curve 44 and a<br>
lower operating curve 46. The x-axis of the chart is defined in terms of a dimensionless<br>
parameter (H/id) and the y-axis of the chart is defined in terms of the maximum flame<br>
velocity at the tip of the burner block (VBb). The upper operating curve 44 and the lower<br>
operating curve 46 represent the maximum and minimum allowed velocities at the tip of<br>
the burner block 38 (VBb) for a given (H/id) and define three operating zones; an upper<br>
operating zone 48, a middle operating zone 50, and a lower operating zone 52. The upper<br>
operating zone 48 represents excessive high velocity or an unsafe operating zone and the<br>
lower operating zone 52 represents a thermally inefficient zone. The middle operating<br>
zone 50 defines an acceptable area of operation of the oxygen-fuel burners 34 in<br>
accordance with the present invention. As shown in FIG. 6, the (H/id) parameter ranges<br>
between about 6-30 and the maximum permissible velocity at the tip of the burner block<br>
(VBb) is 167 m\s 550 feet per second. It will be appreciated that the middle operating zone 50<br>
provides the required impinging flame 36 columnar shape and desired heat transfer<br>
properties to the raw glass-forming material 30.<br>
The upper operating curve 44 and the lower operating curve 46 for the oxygen-fuel<br>
burner 34 are described by a fourth order linear polynomial:<br><br><br>
Wherein,	<br>
VBb = maximum velocity at the end of the burner block m/or feet/second).<br>
H = distance from the end of the burner block to the top of the raw glass-<br>
forming material surface m/or feet),<br>
id = inside diameter of the opening of the burner block (feet).<br>
For the upper operating curve 44 as shown in FIG. 6, the ratio of H/id is between<br>
about 6 - 20 and the range of VBb is between58-168 m/s about 190 - 550 feet per second, and the<br>
value of the coefficients is as follows: a=571.0801, b=-187.2957, c=30.1164, d=-1.8198<br>
and e=0.04. For the lower operating curve 46 as shown in FIG. 6, the ratio of H/id is<br>
between about 6-30 and the range of VBb is between 15-91 m/s about 50 - 300 feet per second, and<br>
the value of the coefficients is as follows: a=-103.6111, b-38.9939, c=-2.8772, d=0.1033<br>
and e=-0.00125. For a particular (H) and (id) as provided above, the (H/id) parameter is<br>
set (x-axis of the chart) which in turn determines the maximum velocity of the oxygen-<br>
fuel burner 36 at the tip of the burner block (VBb) (y-axis of the chart) which must be<br>
between the upper operating curve 44 and the lower operating curve 46 to provide the<br>
required impinging columnar flame 36 shape and desired heat transfer properties to melt<br>
the raw glass-forming material 30.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in accordance with the present invention, the columnar shape<br>
of the impinging flame 36 when operating within the middle operating zone 50 of FIG. 6<br>
is shown. The impinging flame 36 is an axisymmetric columnar flame having three<br>
distinct flow regions; a free jet region 54, a stagnation region 56 and a wall jet region 58.<br>
The free jet region 54 is an unobstructed impinging flame region. Within the free<br>
jet region 54, the flame 36 develops a columnar shape before the flame impinges on the<br>
surface of the raw glass-forming material 30. The columnar flame shape is produced as a<br>
result of the controlled exit velocities of the oxygen and fuel streams. More particularly,<br>
within the free jet region 54, the oxygen and fuel streams flow from the opening of the<br>
burner block 38 to produce a controlled shear stress between the two streams that yields a<br>
controlled laminar stream for an extended length to provide a precisely controlled mixing<br><br>
of the two streams and a partial controlled combustion. The partial controlled combustion<br>
that is achieved in the free-jet region 54 is critical to the heat transfer characteristics of the<br>
developing impinging flame 36. The columnar free-jet flame shape has a flame diameter<br>
D2 at half the distance H/2 between the end of the burner block 38 and the surface of the<br>
raw glass-forming material 30 which is defined by the following relation.<br><br>
Wherein,<br>
id = inside diameter of the opening of the burner block,<br>
H = distance from the end of the burner block to the top surface of the raw glass-<br>
forming material,<br>
D2 = flame diameter at one half the distance between the end of the burner block<br>
and the surface of the raw glass-forming material.<br>
The second region, the stagnation region 56, is the region where the flame 36<br>
penetrates the thermal boundary layer and impinges upon the surface of the raw glass-<br>
forming material 30. Within this region 56, the flame 36 penetrates the thermal boundary<br>
layer and impinges on the surface of the raw glass-forming material building a sharp<br>
pressure gradient at the surface that accelerates the horizontal flow of the deflected flame<br>
causing the flame to spread outwardly radially along the impinged surface. The end of the<br>
stagnation region 56 is defined as the location on the surface of the raw glass-forming<br>
material where the pressure gradient generated by the impinging flame 36 drops to zero.<br>
Within the stagnation region 56, by carefully controlling the flame 36 momentum, the<br>
thermal boundary layer that naturally exists at the surface of the raw glass-forming<br>
material 30 is penetrated and eliminated and thus its strong heat resistive features are<br>
attenuated. Accordingly, the heat generated by the impinging flame 36 penetrates more<br>
easily into the partially melted raw glass-forming material 30. Furthermore, within the<br>
stagnation region 56 the flame 36 luminosity significantly increases which enhances the<br>
radiation heat transfer into the relatively colder raw glass-forming material 30.<br>
At the radial limits of the stagnation region 56 the wall jet region 58 begins. In<br>
this region, the flame 36 flows essentially parallel to the impinging surface and the<br>
thermal boundary layer grows along the impingement surface and outward from the<br><br>
stagnation region 56, thus the thermal boundary layer starts to build up restoring the<br>
surface resistance to the heat flow into the raw glass-forming material surface.<br>
The controlled flame heat generation in the free-jet region 54 is the result of the<br>
tube-in-tube concentric design of the oxygen-fuel burner 34, inside diameter of the<br>
opening (id) of the burner block 38 and both the relative velocities and maximum and<br>
minimum velocities of the oxygen and fuel streams. By selectively controlling the design<br>
of the oxygen-fuel burner 34, the burner block 38 geometrical design and the velocities of<br>
the oxygen and fuel streams a reduced shear stress between the oxygen and gas streams is<br>
produced providing controlled partial combustion and reduced thermal radiation<br>
emissions. It will be appreciated that by operating the oxygen-fuel burner 34 within the<br>
middle operating zone 50 described herein, the flame heat generated in the free jet region<br>
54 and the heat transfer resistance at the raw glass surface in the stagnation region 56 are<br>
minimized thereby maximizing the heat generated in the stagnation region.<br>
The heat generated in the free-jet region 54 is the result of the following processes.<br>
First, the controlled partial combustion in the free-jet region 54 permits controlled<br>
combustion at the surface of the raw glass-forming material 30 thereby bringing the<br>
combustion process proximate to the surface of the raw glass-forming material. Bringing<br>
the combustion process proximate the surface of the raw glass-forming material 30<br>
generates an elevated temperature gradient at the surface of the raw glass-forming<br>
material thereby improving the convection heat transfer. Second, the controlled partial<br>
combustion in the free-jet region 54 generates an acceptable temperature for the chemical<br>
dissociation of the combustion gases and the products of combustion. These dissociated<br>
species, once impinged on the relatively colder surface of the raw glass-forming material<br>
30, partially recombine, exothermically, generating significant heat at the surface of the<br>
raw glass-forming material. The heat from the exothermic reactions further augments the<br>
convective heat transfer process.<br>
The minimization of the heat resistance at the stagnation region 56 of the surface<br>
of the raw glass-forming material 30 is the result of the following factors. First, the<br>
thermal boundary layer is eliminated through the controlled flame 36 momentum and the<br>
turbulence generated by the carefully controlled combustion characteristics at the surface<br>
xof the raw glass-forming material 30. Second, the localized surface heat generation<br>
the conversion of the low thermal conductive raw glass-forming material 30<br><br><br>
the heat generated at the surface to penetrate more efficiently into the raw glass-forming<br>
material depth. This improved heat penetration lowers the molten glass surface-<br>
temperature, which increases the temperature gradient between the flame 36 and the<br>
molten-glass surface and augments the convective heat transfer process.<br>
The molten glass flows from the melting zone 26 of the glass melting furnace 10<br>
to the fining zone 28. In a preferred embodiment, the fining zone 28 includes at least one<br>
downstream oxygen-fuel burner 34 mounted in the roof 22 of the glass melting furnace<br>
10. The downstream oxygen-fuel burner 34 is of an identical design as described above<br>
and must operate under the same conditions subject to controlled variation to achieve the<br>
desired net effect of the impinging flames. For example, the impinging flame 30 may be<br>
adjusted to be more luminous to affect the melting characteristics. The downstream<br>
oxygen-fuel burner 34 is positioned to fire downwardly over the location at which the<br>
normal convection currents tend to rise. e.g. 2/3 - 3/4 the length of the glass melting<br>
furnace 10.<br>
It will be appreciated that the at least one downstream oxygen-fuel burner 34 has<br>
been found to improve the quality of the glass moving forward into the forming area by<br>
removing surface defects such as incompletely reacted raw glass-forming material or<br>
insufficiently mixed surface materials by substantially raising the surface glass<br>
temperature, promoting melting and mixing. Furthermore, the at least one downstream<br>
oxygen-fuel burner 34 provides a barrier to the forward flow of material, promotes natural<br>
convection currents within the molten glass causing hotter glass to flow backwards under<br>
the raw glass-forming material thereby preventing a forward surge of the molten glass,<br>
increasing the melting effect and increasing the glass temperatures in the fining zone. The<br>
glass moving forward is also hotter and this leads to more rapid fining and reduced fuel<br>
consumption in the forward zones. In addition, for glass melting furnaces that normally<br>
have a layer of foam on the downstream glass surface, the downstream oxygen-fuel burner<br>
34 has been found to reduce the foam. It will be appreciated that by reducing the foam the<br>
heat transfer is increased into the body of glass material so as to reduce the thermal energy<br>
otherwise required in the glass melting furnace 10 and improving the operating efficiency<br>
of the glass melting furnace.<br><br>
The at least one roof mounted oxygen-fuel burner 34 may be either placed in a new glass<br>
melter furnace 10 or retrofitted into an existing glass melter furnace to substantially<br>
reduce plant space and increase the glass quality relative to an air-fuel fired furnace or a<br>
"conventional" side fired oxygen-fuel furnace. It will be appreciated that the present<br>
invention facilitates a substantial pull rate increase, reduction in glass melting furnace 10<br>
wall temperature and improved glass quality as compared to the same air-fuel furnace or<br>
conventional oxygen-fuel furnace that is not retrofitted with at least one roof mounted<br>
oxygen-fuel burner as described herein. Furthermore, as will be readily appreciated by<br>
one skilled in the art, the use of at least one oxygen-fuel burner as opposed to an all air-<br>
fuel burner system appreciably reduces NOx emissions.<br><br>
