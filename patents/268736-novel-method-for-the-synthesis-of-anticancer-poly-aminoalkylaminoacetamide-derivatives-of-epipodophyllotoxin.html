				<td>NEW PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ANTICANCER<br>
(POLY)AMINOALKYLAMINOACETAMIDE DERIVATIVES OF<br>
EPIPODOPHYLLOTOXIN<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of (poly)aminoalkylaminoacetamide derivatives of epipodophyllotoxin, of formula 1, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a group —(CH2)C—NHb, with 2<a></a>
These compounds are composed of an epipodophyllotoxin-type lignan portion and a polyamine portion attached at the 4-position of the epipodophyllotoxin by way of an acetamide moiety.<br>
The presence of the polyamine chain provides the molecule with its water solubility properties, especially for its hydrochlorides, and also its especially valuable pharmacological properties in the treatment of cancers.<br>
These compounds, which are described in patent application WO 2005/100363, are anticancer compounds that are especially useful in the treatment of solid or non-solid tumours such as melanomas, colorectal cancers, cancers of the lung, prostate, bladder, breast, uterus, stomach, pancreas, liver and ovaries and also in the treatment of leukaemias, lymphomas and myelomas, cancers of the ENT system and brain tumours. The synthesis process described in WO 2005/100363 for the preparation of compounds of formula 1 uses, as starting material, podophyllotoxin of formula 2:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with which chloroacetonitrile is reabted in an acid medium to obtain the synthesis<br>
intermediate 4-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of formula 4:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This   compound   is   then  condensed   with  a  primary-amine-containing  reactant  of<br>
formula 5:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R' represents a hydrogen atom or a chain —(CH2)C—NHP and wherein P represents a group protecting the amine functions.<br>
Appropriate protecting groups may be a benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl radical. This condensation is carried out in a mixture of solvents comprising a polar aprotic solvent (acetonitrile, DMF) in the presence of a Lewis base (triethylamine).<br>
However, this process, besides the fact that it has a high number of steps and therefore quite a low overall yield, has two disadvantages:<br>
On the one hand, the conditions used in patent specification WO 2005/100363 are conducive to epimerisation of the carbon in the 2-position of the epipodophyllotoxin derivative of formula 1, resulting in a cis-lactone form, referred to as the "picro" form, of formula 7:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Purification of the desired trans-lactone product is therefore difficult and necessitates laborious and costly chromatography operations.<br>
On the other hand, the method described hereinbefore also produces bis-alkylation type by-products, as a result of reaction of another molecule of 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin with the product of formula 1 already formed. The use of an excess of primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 5 is then necessary for conversion of the starting materials that is as complete as possible whilst minimising the by-products obtained, which necessitates a difficult step of recovering the excess amine, making this process uneconomical.<br>
The Applicant has found, in unexpected manner, that by using a primary-amine-containing reactant corresponding to formula 6, wherein a, b and R are as defined hereinbefore but in which the amine functions are not protected, the potential secondary products are minimised and their presence does not present a major handicap to obtaining a pure final compound.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The   direct   condensation   of   4-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin   of formula 4 with the primary-amine-containing reactant, without an additional step of protecting the amine functions of the latter, is then carried out under conditions that are satisfactory in terms of yield and the purity of the product obtained. Accordingly, in the case of the compound wherein a = 3, b = 4 and c = 3, a synthesis procedure which, when the process as described in WO 2005/100363 is employed, comprises 11 steps with an overall yield of about 15% is replaced by a synthesis procedure according to the present invention which makes it possible in only 3 steps to obtain an overall yield of 30%. Within  the   framework   of the   synthesis  procedure   of the  present   invention,   a stoichiometric amount of reagents is employed, which minimises the cost. The preponderant product of the reaction is, then, the alkylation product forming the linear-chain compound as a result of its being very largely the primary amine function that is substituted. Such reaction selectivity is surprising in view of the secondary products obtained when using the synthesis route described in WO 2005/100363. Use of the non-protected amine results predominantly in the desired product. This method moreover has the advantage of limiting the number of steps because of the fact that the steps for protection of the primary-amine-containing reactant are no longer necessary.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a process for the synthesis of compounds of<br>
formula   1,   comprising   a   step   of   condensation   of  the   4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-<br>
demethylepipodophyllotoxin intermediate of formula 4 with a primary-amine-containing<br>
reactant of formula 6 not having prior protection of the amine functions.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 are preferably obtained in hydrochloride form.<br>
This condensation reaction is carried out in direct manner without its being necessary for<br>
any amine function of the primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6 used to be<br>
protected by any suitable protecting group.<br>
The  step  of condensation of 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of<br>
formula 4 with the non-protected primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6 is<br>
preferably carried out in a polar aprotic solvent.<br>
Preference is given to the polar aprotic solvent used in the condensation step being selected from: dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and also dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
Preference is also given to the condensation reaction being carried out in a temperature range between -20°C and 30°C inclusive. An increase in temperature is observed when the operation is conducted using an amount of several tens of grams and therefore controlling the reaction temperature is preferable. Even more preferably, the temperature will accordingly be maintained at 0°C.<br>
The invention relates also to a process for the synthesis of compounds of formula 1 wherein the step of condensation of the 4(3-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodo-phyllotoxin intermediate of formula 4 with the primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6 is followed by a step of recovery of compound 1.<br>
The step of recovery of the product of formula 1 is preferably carried out by precipitation from an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, followed by a step of reverse-phase chromatography in an acid medium. The compound is purified in an acid solution, e.g. hydrochloric acid. It is not subject to the risk of epimerisation at the lactone resulting in the "picro" derivative. Final lyophilisation makes it possible to isolate the salt of the desired compound.<br>
Preference is also given to using, as the non-protected primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6, spermine or spermidine of formulae 8 and 9 below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the case of condensation with spermidine, which is a dissymmetrical polyamine, 2 isomeric compounds of formula 1 are obtained in equal parts (compounds wherein a = 3, b = 4, R = H and a = 4, b = 3, R = H).<br>
In the case of condensation with spermine, it is the compound wherein a = 3, b = 4 and R = (CH2)3-NH2 that is obtained.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to a process for the synthesis of the compound wherein a = 3, b = 4 and R = H, or 2-[3-(4-aminobutylamino)-propylamino]-N-[9-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-oxo-5,5a,6,8,8a,9-hexahydrofuro[3',4':6,7]-naphtho[2,3-d][l,3]dioxol-5-yl]-acetamide, comprising a step of condensation of 40-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of formula 4 with spermidine, followed by a step of recovery of said compound.<br>
The present invention relates also to a process for the synthesis of the compound wherein a = 4, b = 3 and R = H, or 2-[4-(3-aminopropylamino)-butylamino]-N-[9-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-oxo-5,5a,6,8,8a,9-hexahydrofuro[3',4':6,7]naphtho[2,3-d][l,3]-dioxol-5-yl]-acetamide, comprising a step of condensation of 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of formula 4 with spermidine, followed by a step of recovery of said compound.<br>
The present invention relates also to a process for the synthesis of the compound wherein a = 3, b = 4 and R = (CH2)3-NH2, or 2-{3-[4-(3-aminopropylamino)-butylamino]-propylamino}-N-[9-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-oxo-5,5a,6,8,8a,9-hexahydro-furo[3',4':6,7]naphtho[2,3-d][l,3]dioxol-5-yl]-acetamide, comprising a step of condensation of 4(3-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of formula 4 with spermine, followed by a step of recovery of said compound.<br>
The invention relates also to use of the primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6 in the preparation of compounds of general formula 1 in accordance with a process involving a step of condensation between that primary-amine-containing reactant and 4(3-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of formula 4.<br>
The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1 starting from podophyllotoxin of formula 2, comprising the following steps and characterised in that the primary-amine-containing reactant used in step c) is the reactant of formula 6. The condensation of step c) is carried out in direct manner without a step of protection, by any protecting group, of the amine functions of the primary-amine-containing reactant used.<br>
a)	Preparation   of  4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin   of  formula  3   starting   from podophyllotoxin of formula 2<br>
b)	Conversion of the 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin into 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin of formula 4<br>
c)	Condensation of the 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin with a primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6<br>
Step a) will preferably be carried by the process described in patent application<br>
WO 97/21713, that is to say by treatment of podophyllotoxin with a pairing of strong<br>
acid/aliphatic, aromatic or functionalised sulfide in the presence of an organic or<br>
inorganic acid or in the presence of water with or without an organic water-miscible<br>
solvent.<br>
Step b) will preferably be carried out according to the method described in patent<br>
application WO 2005/100363, that is to say by reaction of the 4'-demethylepipodo-<br>
phyllotoxin obtained in the preceding step, with chloroacetonitrile, in an acid medium.<br>
Step c) and also the subsequent recovery step are carried out as described hereinbefore,<br>
the primary-amine-containing reactant used not having any protection of its amine<br>
functions.<br>
At the end of the recovery step, the compound of general formula 1 may optionally be<br>
converted into a salt with the aid of an inorganic or organic acid.<br>
Preference is given to carrying out the condensation step c) in a polar aprotic solvent<br>
selected from: dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and also<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
Preference is given also to the condensation reaction being carried out in a temperature<br>
range between -20°C and 30°C inclusive, more especially at 0°C.<br>
Preference is given to the step of recovery of the compound of formula 1 being carried<br>
out by precipitation from an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, followed by a<br>
step of reverse-phase chromatography in an acid medium. The compound is purified in an acid solution, e.g. hydrochloric acid.<br>
Preference is given also to the non-protected primary-amine-containing reactant of<br>
formula 6 used in the condensation step c) being spermine or spermidine.<br>
When it is spermidine that is used in step c), there will be obtained the two isomeric<br>
compounds of formula 1 wherein a = 3,b = 4, R = H and a = 4, b=3,R=H in equal<br>
parts.<br>
In the case of condensation with spermine, it is the compound wherein a = 3, b = 4 and<br>
R = (CH2)3-NH2 that is obtained.<br>
The invention relates also to use of the primary-amine-containing reactant of formula 6<br>
in the preparation of compounds of general formula 1 starting from podophyllotoxin, in<br>
accordance with steps a) and then b) and then c) described hereinbefore.<br>

c)	Condensation   of   the   4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin   of formula 4 with spermidine.<br>

The crystals are filtered off and dried to obtain 1.9 g of crude compound 1. Purification by preparative HPLC is carried out (Lichrospher 100 RP 18, elution HC1: c = 5mM). The fractions are lyophilised and then taken up in ethyl ether, and the hydrochloride of compound 1 is obtained in amorphous form with a purity of 97%, yield 40%.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
Under the same conditions as for the derivative of Example 1, but replacing the spermine by spermidine of formula 9, there are obtained the compounds of formula 1 (product A: a = 3, b = 4, R = H; and product B: a = 4, b = 3, R = H). In the same manner as in Example 1, these 2 products are isolated in equivalent proportions, with an overall yield of 40%.<br>
These products are in all points the same as the compounds obtained in Examples 31 and 32 respectively of patent application WO 2005/100363.<br>

acetamide, in hydrochloride form, starting from podophyllotoxin, in 3 steps<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
10 g (24 nmol) of podophyllotoxin are dissolved in 60 ml of trifluoroacetic acid. There are successively added 5.4 ml (72 mmol) of methanesulfonic acid. Stirring is carried out for 9 hours, 5.4 ml (72 mmol) of dimethyl sulfide are again added and stirring is carried out for 9 hours. The mixture is discharged onto ice (600 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 300 ml). The organic phases are washed with water and then with NaHCO3 solution until neutral. After drying over sodium sulfate, filtration and evaporation, there are obtained 6.3 g of 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin, which is used directly in the next step.<br>
2nd step<br>
30 g of 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin are added to 47.4 ml of chloroacetonitrile and then, with stirring, 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid are added. Stirring is carried out for 3 hours at ambient temperature. 300 ml of isopropanol are then added, with stirring. The precipitate obtained is filtered off and washed with 200 ml of isopropanol. The precipitate is rinsed with water until the pH is neutral, and then with ethyl ether. After drying in vacuo, there are obtained 34.2 g (yield 96%) of a white solid (m.p. = 240°C) corresponding to 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin.<br>
3rd step<br>
Starting from the 4ß-chloroacetamido-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin obtained in the preceding step, synthesis is continued in accordance with the method described in Example 1 to obtain the product of formula 1 (a = 3, b = 4, c = 3).<br>
This Example is transferrable to all compounds of formula 1 by using the corresponding non-protected primary-amine-containing reactants of formula 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
