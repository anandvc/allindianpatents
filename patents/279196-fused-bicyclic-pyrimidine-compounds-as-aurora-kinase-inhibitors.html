AS AURORA KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of the priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C.<br>
§ 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/049,063, filed April<br>
30, 2008. The content of the prior application is incorporated herein by its<br>
entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Protein kinases play important roles in cellular signal pathways that<br>
regulate various cell functions such as differentiation, proliferation, migration<br>
and apoptosis. Deregulation of protein kinases is implicated in a number of<br>
diseases including cancer. Thus protein kinases are attractive therapeutic<br>
targets in cancer treatment.<br>
Aurora kinases, belonging to the serine/threonine subclass of kinases,<br>
are involved in the regulation of mitosis. Three isoforms A, B and C are<br>
known. Aurora A is involved in centrosome maturation and separation, bi-<br>
polar spindle assembly and mitotic entry; Aurora B and C are essential for<br>
accurate chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The deregulated Aurora<br>
kinase activity has been linked to genetic instability, defects in centrosome<br>
function, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis, all of<br>
which can lead to tumorigenesis. For exampAle, both Aurora A and B levels<br>
are up-regulated in various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancers.<br>
Thus, it is of great interest to develop Aurora kinase inhibitors as anti-cancer<br>
drugs.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
This invention is based on the discovery that certain fused bicyclic<br>
pyrimidine compounds can be used to inhibit activity of Aurora kinase (e.g.,<br>
Aurora A, Aurora B, and or Aurora C), which allows these compounds to be<br>
applied in treating Aurora kinase mediated disorders such as cancer.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Shown below arc exemplary compounds of this invention:<br>
The fused bicyclic pyrimidine compounds of this invention can be<br>
prepared by conventional chemical transformations (including protecting<br>
group methodologies), e.g., those described in R. Larock, Comprehensive<br>
Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T.W. Greene and P.G.M.<br>
Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3 Ed., John Wiley and Sons<br>
(1999); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic<br>
Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of<br>
Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent<br>
editions thereof. Schemes land 2 below show transformations for<br>
synthesizing compounds of this invention.<br>
The route shown in Scheme 1 exemplifies synthesis of the<br>
furanopyrimidine compounds (VIII) of the present invention. To a mixture of<br>
appropriately substituted benzoin (I) and malanonitrile (II) in DMF maintained<br>
at 0°C, diethylamine is added dropwise over a time of 30 min. The reaction<br>
mixture is allowed to stir for 16 h. Water is then added to the reaction<br>
mixture. A precipitate thus formed is collected and crystallized in ethanol to<br>
give substituted furan (III). To a mixture of furan (III) and formic acid<br>
maintained at 0°C, acetic anhydride is added dropwise over a period of 30<br>
min. Then the reaction is maintained at 100°C for 16 h. Water is then added<br>
to the reaction mixture and a precipitate is formed to afford a<br>
furanopyrimidinone (IV). A mixture of (IV) and POCl3 is heated at 55-65°C<br>
for 3 h. Water is then added followed by sodium bicarbonate. The resulting<br>
mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate. Concentration of the organic layer,<br>
followed purification of the residue by column chromatography, affords a<br>
chlorine-substituted furanopyrimidine (V). Reaction of (V) with amine (VI)<br>
by heating in n-butanol for 16 h affords amino-substitutcd furanopyrimidine<br>
(VII). Compound (VIII) can be synthesized via reacting (VII) with<br>
appropriate isocyanates in refluxing dichloromethane or by reacting (VII) with<br>
l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in dichloromethane, followed by reaction with<br>
the desired amines or anilines.<br>
The furanopyrimidine compounds of this invention can also be<br>
synthesised by alternative methods. Schemes 2 and 3 below exemplify such<br>
alternative synthetic routes.<br>
As shown in Scheme 2 below, bromination of a chloro-substituted<br>
furanopyrimidine (IX) using AT-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF affords the<br>
bromo, chloro-substituted furanopyrimidine (X). Alternative use of N-<br>
chlorosuccinimide (NCS) ran afford the corresponding chloro derivative of<br>
(X). Reaction of (X) with the amine (VI) by refluxing in ethanol gives bromo,<br>
amino-substituted furanopyrimidine (XI). Compound (XII) is then<br>
synthesized by reacting (XI) with appropriate isocyanates in refluxing<br>
dichloromethane or by reacting (XI) with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in<br>
dichloromethane, followed by reaction with the desired amines or anilines.<br>
Furanopyrimidine compound (XIII) of this invention can be synthesized under<br>
standard Suzuki coupling condition by reacting compound (XII) with<br>
appropriate boronic acid, in the presence of Pd(OAc)2, PPb.3, and sodium<br>
carbonate in a mixture of water and dioxane under refluxing conditions for 2-3<br>
h. Furanopyrimidine compound (XIV) of this invention can be synthesized<br>
under standard Sonagashira coupling condition by reacting compound (XII)<br>
with appropriate alkynyl compound, in the presence of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, PPh3 and<br>
diisopropylcthyl amine (DIPEA) in DMF at 60°C for 16 h.<br>
As shown in Scheme 3 below, compound (XV) is reacted with the<br>
amine (VI) by refluxing in ethanol to give furanopyrimidine (XVI).<br>
Compound (XVII) is then synthesized by reacting (XVI) with an isocyanatc of<br>
choice in refluxing dichloromethane or by reacting (XVI) with 1,1'-<br>
carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in dichloromethane, followed by a reaction with a<br>
desired amine or aniline. Treatment of compound (XVII) with BBr3 in<br>
dichloromethane affords demethylated compound (XVIII). This compound is<br>
alkylated with bromo-chloro-alkane compound (XIX) and then reacted with<br>
amine (XX) of choice to afford the desired product (XXI).<br>
The thienopyrimidine and pyrrolopyrimidine compounds of this<br>
invention can also be synthesized in manners similar to those outlined in<br>
Schemes 1,2, and 3 with necessary modifications as recognized by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
A fused bicyclic pyrimidine compound thus synthesized can be further<br>
purified by flash column chromatography, high performance liquid<br>
chromatography, crystallization, or any other suitable methods.<br>
Also within the scope of this invention are (1) a pharmaceutical<br>
composition that contains an effective amount of at least one of the fused<br>
bicyclic pyrimidine compounds of this invention and a pharmaceutic ally<br>
acceptable carrier, and (2) a method for treating an Aurora kinase mediated<br>
disorder such as cancer by administering to a subject in need of this treatment<br>
an effective amount of such a fused bicyclic pyrimidine compound.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating" refers to administering a fused<br>
bicyclic pyrimidine compound to a subject that has an Aurora kinase mediated<br>
disorder such as cancer, or has a symptom of or a predisposition toward it,<br>
with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate,<br>
improve, affect, or reduce the risk of, the disorder, the symptoms of or the<br>
predisposition toward the disorder. For example, certain compounds of this<br>
invention can be used to reduce the risk of metastasis. The term "an effective<br>
amount" refers to the amount of the active agent that is required to confer the<br>
intended therapeutic effect in the subject. Effective amounts may vary, as<br>
recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on route of administration,<br>
excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other agents.<br>

To practice the method of this invention, the above-described<br>
pharmaceutical composition can be administered orally, parenterally, by<br>
inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an<br>
implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes<br>
subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular,<br>
intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, and<br>
intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
A sterile injectable composition, e.g., a sterile injectable aqueous or<br>
oleaginous suspension, can be formulated according to techniques known in<br>
the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as Tween 80) and<br>
suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile<br>
injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent<br>
or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that can be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils<br>
are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium (e.g.,<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides). Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its<br>
glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in<br>
their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions can also<br>
contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
or similar dispersing agents. Other commonly used surfactants such as<br>
Tweens or Spans or other similar emulsifying agents or bioavailability<br>
enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms can also be used for the<br>
purposes of formulation.<br>
A composition for oral administration can be any orally acceptable<br>
dosage form mcludmg, but not limited to, capsules; tablets, emulsions and<br>
aqueous suspensions, dispersions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral<br>
use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and com starch.<br>
Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For<br>
oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried<br>
com starch. When aqueous suspensions or emulsions are administered orally,<br>
the active ingredient can be suspended or dissolved in an oily phase combined<br>
with emulsifying or suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening,<br>
flavoring, or coloring agents can be added. A nasal aerosol or inhalation<br>
composition can be prepared according to techniques well known in the art of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation. A fused bicyclic pyrimidine compound-<br>
containing composition can also be administered in the form of suppositories<br>
for rectal administration.<br>
The carrier in the pharmaceutical composition must be "acceptable" in<br>
the sense of being compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation<br>
(and preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to<br>
be treated. For example, one or more solubilizing agents which form more<br>
soluble complexes with the fused bicyclic pyrimidine compounds, or more<br>
solubilizing agents, can be utilized as pharmaceutical carriers for delivery of<br>
the active compounds. Examples of other carriers include colloidal silicon<br>
dioxide, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and D&amp;C Yellow #10.<br>
Suitable in vitro assays can be used to preliminarily evaluate the<br>
efficacy of the fused bicyclic pyrimidine compounds of this invention in<br>
inhibiting activity of Aurora kinase. The compounds can further be examined<br>
for their efficacy in treating cancer. For example, a compound can be<br>
administered to an animal (e.g., a mouse model) having cancer and its<br>
therapeutic effects are then assessed. Based on the results, an appropriate<br>
dosage range and administration route can also be determined.<br>
Certain compounds of this invention can also inhibit the activities of<br>
other protein kinases. For example, Compound 82 inhibits the activities of<br>
PLK4, PDGFRB, and FLT3. Therefore, this invention also features a method<br>
for inhibiting the acitivites of protein kinases other than Aurora kinase and a<br>
method for treating disorders mediated via such protein kinases by<br>
"administerihg to a subject in need of this treatment an effective amount of the<br>
fused bicyclic pyrimidine compound described herein. Protein kinases that<br>
can be inhibited by the compounds of the invention include but are not limited<br>
to AURORA, BCR-ABL, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, FLT3, JAK2, C-ABL,<br>
PDK1, CDK, CHK1, LCK, FGFR, RET, C-KIT, C-MET, EPH, SRC, MEK1,<br>
RAF, AKT, PI3K, MTOR, PLK, RET, TIE2, AXL, IKK, PIM, and ROCK<br>
kinase. Other target protein kinases are described by, e.g., Manning et al,<br>
Science 2002,298,1912 and Noble et al., Science 2004, 303, 1800. Diseases<br>
that are associated with protein kinases and can be treated by the methods of<br>
the invention include but are not limited to cancer, diabetes, inflammation,<br>
allergy/asthma, immune diseases, central nervous system diseases, and<br>
angiogenesis disorders.<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that the above description<br>
has adequately enabled the present invention. The following examples are,<br>
therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the<br>
remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. All of the publications<br>

Example 184: Co-crystallization of a fused bicyclic pyrimidine compound and<br>
Aurora kinase<br>
Expression and Purification of Aurora A: Aurora A catalytic<br>
domain (residues 123-401) with one mutation at residue 288 (T288D) and six<br>
His as the tag at the N-terminus was cloned into the pET-28a vector and<br>
expressed in BL21 DE3 E. coli. The protein was then purified by nickel<br>
column following the procedures as suggested by the suppliers (Amersham<br>
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The bound protein was washed with 10% of<br>
Tuffer solution (40 mmol HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mmol NaCl and 500 mmol<br>
imidazole) and eluted with 100% of buffer solution. The fractions containing<br>
Aurora A catalytic domain was then treated with TEV protease (Invitrogen)<br>
overnight at 4 °C to remove the His tag and concentrated to 8 mg/mL in a<br>
buffer containing 40 mmol HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mmol NaCl, 1 mmol DTT.<br>
Crystallization and Structure Determination: The hanging drop<br>
method was used to obtain the crystals of Aurora A in complex with test<br>
compounds. A drop of 1.5 1 protein pre-incubated with a test compound for<br>
half hour on ice was mixed with the equal volume of reservoir solution (22%<br>
PEG400 and 0.1 mmol ammonia sulfate). The crystals were grown at 18 °C<br>
for 3-7 days. Before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, the crystal was<br>
immersed briefly in a cryoprotectant containing 37% PEG400. Diffraction<br>
data were collected on beamline SP12B2 at the SPring-8 (Japan) and<br>
beamlines, BL13B1 and BL13C1, at the NSRRC (Taiwan). The data were<br>
processed by DENZO (see Otwinowski, Z.; Minor, W. Processing of x-ray<br>
diffraction data collected in oscillation mode. Methods in Enzymology 1997,<br>
276, 307-326) and reduced with SCALEPACK. The structure was solved by<br>
molecular replacement in MOLREP (see Vagin A , T. A. MOLREP: an<br>
automated program for molecular replacement. J. Appl. Cryst. 1997, 30, 1022-<br>
1025) using the published Aurora A structure (PDB code: 1MQ4) as the<br>
search model. The refinement calculation were performed by REFMAC5 (see<br>
Murshudov GN, V. A., Dodson EJ. Refinement of macromolecular structures<br>
by the maximum-likelihood method. Acta Crystallogr 1997, D, 240-255) and<br>
model building was carried out with the program O9.0 (see Jones TA, Z. J.,<br>
Cowan SW, Kjeldgaard. Improved methods for building protein models in<br>
electron density maps and the location of errors in these models. Acta<br>
Crystallogr 1991, A, 110-119).<br>
Compounds 6, 202, and 206 were each co-crystallized with Aurora A.<br>
Each of the compound-Aurara A complex structures was solved by x-ray<br>
crystallography.<br>
Example 185: Inhibiting Aurora A activity<br>
Aurora kinase A protein purification: The GST-tAurora A (123-<br>
401 aa) fusion protein was produced by baculovirus expression system. The<br>
Aurora A catalytic domain with an N-terminal GST tag was constructed in<br>
pBacPAK8 plasmid and expressed in sf9 cells. Recombinant baculovirus<br>
infected sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were<br>
resuspended in PBS buffer (PBS, pH 7.3, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4,<br>
0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail table<br>
(1125700, Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication, and lysates were cleared<br>
by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The supematants were loaded<br>
into 1 ml of GST Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (17-5132-01, GE healthcare) column<br>
previously washed with PBS buffer. The column were washed with 30<br>
volumes of PBS buffer, and then eluted by elution buffer (50 mM Tris (pH<br>
8.0), 10 mM glutathione). To concentrate GST-tAurora A, buffer was<br>
replaced with Tris buffer (100 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM<br>
EDTA, 4 mM DTT) using Amicon ultra-15 (MWCO:30K, Millipore) to 2.4<br>
mg/ml. After the addition of equal volume of glycerol and 0.04% Triton X-<br>
100, the proteins were stored aliquoted at -80°C.<br>
Aurora Kinase A luminescent kinase assay: The inhibitory activity<br>

modified method described in Koresawa, M.; Okabe, T. Assay Drug Dev<br>
Technol 2004, 2,153. Briefly, a test compound, enzyme, substrate-<br>
tetra(LRRWSLG), DTT and ATP were dissolved in Aur buffer (50 mM Tris-<br>
HC1 pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 µg/ml BSA) individually<br>
before the assay. Test compounds were consecutively diluted from 10 mM<br>
stock (for single dose: compounds were diluted from 10 mM stock to 100 uM<br>
and<br>
20 µM; for IC50: 5x serial dilution was made from 100 µM to 0.16 µM) in Aur<br>
buffer. Diluted compounds (25 µl) were pre-incubated with purified 105 ng<br>
(10 ul) of GST-tAurora A (123-401aa) fusion protein at 25°C for 15 min into<br>
96 well U-bottomed plates (268152, NUNC). 5 µM ATP (5 µl), 1 mM DTT (5<br>
µl) and 0.1 mM tetra(LRRWSLG) peptide substrate (5 µl) were added into the<br>
reactions of test compounds and GST-tAurora A. The reactions were<br>
incubated at 37°C for 90 min. 50 µl of Kinase-Glo Plus Reagent (V3771,<br>
Promega) was added into the reactions, followed by the incubation at 25°C for<br>
20 min. 70 µl of reaction solutions were transferred to 96 well black plates<br>
(237108, NUNC) to quantify the ATP remaining in the solutions, which<br>
inversely relates to kinase activity. The luminescence was recorded by vector2<br>
(V-1420 multilabel HTS counter, Perkin Elmer).<br>

Example 186: In vitro anticancer activity<br>
HCT-116 cell viability was examined by the MTS assay (Promega,<br>
Madison, WI, USA). 2000 HCT-116 cells in 100 nL McCoy's 5a medium<br>
were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. After 96-h incubation with a test<br>
compound, the cells were incubated with 20 µL of a MTS/PMS mixture<br>
(MTS/PMS ratio: 20:1) for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5%<br>
CO2 to allow viable cells to convert the tetrazolium salt (MTS) into formazan.<br>
The amount/concentration of formazan, which indicates the number of live<br>
cells, was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a<br>
PerkinElmer Victor2 plate reader (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA).<br>
Compounds 6, 10, 13-16, 19-21, 23, 24, 27-33, 35, 36, 38-42, 57, 58,<br>
60, 61, 79, 80, 82, 91-98,100, 107, 115, 118, 119, 122-124, 126, 146-148,<br>
151, 152, 160, 161,163, 164, 171-173, 175, 176, and 196-257 were tested in<br>
this assay. Unexpectedly, Compounds 6, 14, 23, 24, 42, 57, 58, 60, 61, 79, 80,<br>
82,92,93,96, 115, 123, 147, 148, 171, 172, 176, 196,202,204,207,211-215,<br>
217-226, 230, 232, 235-237, 239-241, 244, 245, and 247-256 showed IC50<br>
values (i.e., the concentration of a test compound which causes 50% of the cell<br>
death) between 100 nM and 900 nM; and Compounds 205, 206,209, and 210<br>
showed IC50 values lower than 100 nM.<br>
Example 187: In vivo anticancer activity<br>
In vivo efficacy of the compounds of this invention was assessed using<br>
colon tumor xenograft mice (injected with HCT-116), as described in Cancer<br>
Research 2004, 64,4621-4628.<br>
HCT-116 cells were grown as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice.<br>
When well-established HCT-116 xenografts were palpable with tumor size of<br>
~100 mm , mice were randomly assigned to three groups: a vehicle control<br>
group (10 mice), a positive control group (10 mice), and a treatment group (21<br>
mice). Of the treated mice, ten received Compound 209 at a daily dosage of 5<br>
mg/kg and eleven received the same compound at a daily dosage of 15 mg/kg<br>
of via IV injection through the tail veins for 5 days/week for 2 consecutive<br>
weeks (days 1-5 and 8-12). The positive control mice received VX-680 (a<br>
known anti-cancer compound) at a daily dosage of 50mg/kg also via IV<br>
injection through the tail veins for 5 days/week for 2 consecutive weeks (days<br>
1-5 and 8-12).<br>
At the dosage of 5 mg/kg, Compound 209 suppressed tumor growth<br>
insignificantly while at a higher dosage, 15 mg/kg, Compound 209,<br>
unexpectedly showed inhibition of tumor growth comparable to that of VX-<br>
680 at a dosage of 50 mg/kg, indicating potent in vivo anti-cancer activity.<br>
More specifically, the treated mice on average had a tumor size of 381 mm3 on<br>
the fourth day and 654 mm3 on the eleventh day, while the vehicle control<br>
mice on average had a tumor size 567 mm on the fourth day and 1254 mm3<br>
on the eleventh day.<br>
