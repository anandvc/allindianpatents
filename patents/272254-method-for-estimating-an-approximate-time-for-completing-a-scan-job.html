				<td>A method and system for displaying dynamic time calculation and progression in MFP, based on job settings is explained in the proposed invention. The standard time required for scanning one page of a document with a given scan settings is obtained from the scanner in the MFP. Total number of pages to be scanned is dynamically obtained by using Automatic Document Feeder. The dynamically obtained number of pages is multiplied with the standard time obtained from the scanner to obtain total time required for completion of the job. The total time thus obtained is displayed on a user interface of the MFP. Further, the number of pages left to be scanned is also obtained from the ADF to calculate and display the time remaining for the job to complete at any instant during the progress of the job. The invention thereby enables calculation of approximate job time before the start of the job. The invention enables dynamic calculation of progression time at any instant during the progress of the job.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to Multi Function Peripherals (MFPs). Particularly the present invention relates to a method of calculating the job-time based on the given job with a user interface that can display the estimated time. More particularly the present invention relates to a method for displaying dynamic job time calculation and progression in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
MFPs are becoming common in almost all the office environments. The usage of MFP will be cumbersome unless or otherwise the given jobs are managed properly especially in the case of shared environments. The problem can be solved to a great extend if the time required for various jobs can be calculated in advance. Researches have been going on in this field and the following description enumerates some of the prior arts relating to this field.<br>
The US patent publication titled, “Time to Completion Interaction for a Copier”, describes a method for continuously monitoring time for completion of a programmed job in a copier. According to the method, total number of copies to be made are calculated from the number of original copies supplied by an operator and the number of copies required for each original copy programmed by the operator. Total time required to complete the programmed job is calculated by multiplying the total number of copies to be made with a constant time required to produce one<br>
 <br>
copy. The total time thus obtained is displayed on a display device. Further, the progress of the programmed job is monitored to compute number of copies remaining to be produced. The number of copies remaining to be produced is used to find out time remaining for the completion of the programmed job at any instant during the progress of the programmed job. The time remaining for completion of the job at any instant is displayed on the display device. However the patent publication discloses a method for continuously monitoring time for completion of a programmed job in a copier. The patent mentions about calculating and displaying time required for completion of a job. However, the time required is not found based on the job settings, rather a constant time required to produce a single copy is used for finding the time required.<br>
Another patent publication titled, “System and Method for Determining the Time Required to Complete a Print Job”, describes a method for estimating time required to print a document. According to the method, a document to be printed is selected and a printer for printing the document is also selected. The selected document’s characteristic is displayed on home page of the selected printer. Time required for printing the selected document is determined on displaying the characteristic of the selected printer. The determined time is displayed on a display and then the document id printed on the selected printer. However the patent publication does not seem to disclose the concept of determining and displaying time remaining for the printing job to complete at any instant during the progress of the job.<br>
 <br>
Yet another patent titled,” Estimation of Time to Complete a Print Job”, describes a method and a system for estimating time required to print a document. According to the method, a document to be printed is selected. Number of pages in the print job is determined by multiplying number of pages in the document with the number of copies required for the document. The printer then calculates a complexity metric for each page to be printed. The complexity metric is calculated by using an algorithm. The algorithm calculates complexity metric based on number of vectors required to describe the page, number of complex graphic functions required to print the page, and the dimensions and bit depth of raster images included on the page. Values in complexity metric thus obtained are used to calculate value of a function. The value of the function provides estimated time required for printing the page. Similarly, estimated time required for printing other pages is determined and the estimated time values are summed up to obtain the total estimated time required for printing the document. The total time thus obtained is displayed on a display device and the time is continuously decreased as the job proceeds. However, time remaining for the print job is not calculated based on the number of pages left to be printed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a method and system to dynamically calculate and display the approximate time required or remaining time progress bar for the current job in MFP.<br>
 <br>
In MFP the documents are fed in ADF and various MFP supported setting is made before the start of the scan (Eg: Scan Setting: dpi/ color /darkness level/ etc). The scan time is dependent on the various scan setting being made. All the documents fed in ADF are the input documents for the current job.<br>
So the approximate time for the job to end can be shown to the user by calculation based on the two factors:<br>
a)	approximate time required for the various job specific setting for the current job;<br>
b)	number of documents that are to be processed or scanned for the current job.<br>
Time required for various settings differ. E.g., color scan of 1200dpi of A4 sheet will take a considerably more time than the time required for 300dpi black and white scan. Also the time required by factor (a) is multiplied by the number of sheets factor (b) to be scanned.<br>
The time required for factor (a) can be obtained from the scanner as the scan time is constant and pre-defined for various combinations of settings for various scanners. The number of paper to be scanned for the current job can be calculated from the number of sheets present in the ADF. It can be done by incorporating the electronic document counter in the ADF.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for displaying dynamic job time progression in MFP comprising the steps of;<br>
(a)	initializing the settings for multiple scanners for multiple combinations of documents;<br>
(b)	getting one page scan time based on the initialized settings;<br>
(c)	getting the number of pages. in ADF dynamically;<br>
(d)	finding the approximate time for executing the said job;<br>
(e)	displaying the said time for execution of the job dynamically through a user interface;<br>
(f)	checking whether the said job has started execution by a control unit in the said MFP;<br>
(g)	reducing the value of the number of pages in ADF dynamically as the document scan gets completed;<br>
(h) finding the approximate time for the remaining job; and (i) displaying the said time for the remaining job through a user interface, where the said process is repeated until the said job is over.<br>
Finding the approximate time for executing the said job is obtained by multiplying the one page scan time and the number of pages in ADF. Finding the approximate time for the remaining job is obtained by multiplying the reduced value of the number of pages and one page scan time.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for displaying dynamic job time progression in MFP comprising:<br>
 <br>
(a)	means for initializing the settings for multiple scanners for multiple combinations of documents;<br>
(b)	means for getting one page scan time based on the initialized settings;<br>
(c)	means for getting the number of pages in ADF dynamically;<br>
(d)	means for finding the approximate time for executing the said job;<br>
(e)	means for displaying the said time for execution of the job dynamically through a user interface;<br>
(f)	means for checking whether the said job has started execution by a control unit in the said MFP;<br>
(g)	means for reducing the value of the number of pages in ADF dynamically as the document scan gets completed;<br>
(h) means for finding the approximate time for the remaining job; and (i) means for displaying the said time for the remaining job through a user interface.<br>
The said means for finding the approximate time for executing the said job obtain the said time by multiplying the one page scan time and the number of pages in ADF. The said means for finding the approximate time for the remaining job obtain the said time by multiplying the reduced value of the number of pages and one page scan time.<br>
Thus the time required for the job and also the progressive time for the current job in progress can be calculated dynamically and displayed so that the user can estimate the time for the completion of the required job and can schedule the works<br>
 <br>
accordingly.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
 <br>
Figure 1 is the flow diagram for displaying dynamic job time calculation. The various steps involved are:<br>
step 1) The scan settings are initialized as the requirement.<br>
step 2) Get the standard time ‘a1 from scanner for one page scan time based on<br>
the settings.<br>
step 3) Get the number of pages ‘b’ in ADF by dynamically from the document<br>
counter.<br>
step 4) The product ‘c1 is calculated c=a* b, to find out approximate time for the<br>
job.<br>
step 5) Display the time ‘c’ needed for the current job dynamically through any<br>
standard user interface.<br>
Figure 2 is the flow diagram for displaying dynamic job progressing time. After the various steps depicted in the first figure, the program control goes to the following steps:<br>
step 1)The scan settings are initialized as the requirement.<br>
step 2) Get the standard time ‘a1 from scanner for one page scan time based on<br>
the settings.<br>
step 3) Get the number of pages ‘b’ in ADF by dynamically.<br>
step 4) Multiply c=a* b, to find out approximate time for the job.<br>
step 5) Display the time c needed for the current job dynamically through any<br>
standard user interface.<br>
step 6) The control unit checks whether the job has started. If it has started, it will<br>
reduce the value of b dynamically as the document scan gets completed.<br>
 <br>
step 7) Recalculate the product with the reduced b value to find out the<br>
approximate time for the remaining job.<br>
step 8) Display the time c needed for the remaining current job dynamically<br>
through any standard user interface and this process is repeated until the job is<br>
over.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
