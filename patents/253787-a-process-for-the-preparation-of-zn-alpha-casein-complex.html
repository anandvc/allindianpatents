				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of heat stable Zn-alpha casein complex.<br>
Nutritional significance of zinc is well known. Zinc is an essential micronutrient and has a role in neonatal growth and immunity. The major consequences of zinc deficiency were shown to be growth retardation, retarded sexual maturation, skin lesions iron deficiency anemia, and has neuromodulatory effect. Zinc requirement for cell-mediated immunity is also well established. Zinc is an essential trace element in human nutrition playing a role in structure and function of several enzymes. Zinc deficiency will lead to anorexia, poor growth and wound healing, and skin problems. Zinc according to the World Health Organization reports is considered to be an essential mineral along with Iron and Beta-Carotene. A crude estimate of zinc deficiency in children indicates that it ranks before iron deficiency anemia but after Vitamin A deficiency in the global burden of diseases and disabilities. Zinc deficiencies are also known to cause diarrheal diseases and malaria. Zinc is an essential requirement to all forms of life. Among the trace metals present in higher mammals, Zinc is second to iron and is tightly bound to metalloproteins and enzymes. Decrease in Zinc levels can reduce memory function in brain.<br>
To date no programs have been implemented to address iron and zinc deficiencies in children. Such programs can be food based; including fortification of commonly used foods or consists of the provision of supplements. Milk in its natural form is almost unique and as a balanced source of man's dietary need. The various steps in processing and storage have a measurable impact on some specific nutrients.   Milk also  provides  a  convenient and  useful  vehicle for<br>
addition of certain nutrients to man's diet and has the following benefits: Milk and milk products are widely consumed regularly in predictable amounts by the people of all age groups. Costs are affordable by target population. The stability and bioavailablility of the added micronutrients are very high. Addition of fortificants usually caused minimum change in color, taste, and appearance.<br>
The minerals in bovine milk are present in a solution in which there exists equilibrium between the free ions and complexes with various components such as proteins, carbohydrates, and aminoacids. The mineral content of the milk is not constant. Based on the knowledge that nearly all the twenty minerals that are considered as essential in the human diet are present in higher amount in cow's milk than in human milk. The availability of zinc in human   milk   is   1.5   mg/L   compared   to   3.5   mg/L   in   cows   milk.<br>
Cow's milk contains about 78% casein, of which 65% is a Casein, a Casein is a major fraction of milk caseins involved in transport of calcium and other metal ions to neonates. It is present in all mammalian milk as random coil protein. The a Casein found to be protective against heat coagulation, having chaperone like activity, binds to membrane receptors and acts as a signal transducer, rheomorphic (plasticity), having poly (1-proline) II (PPII) helical conformation, transporter of other milk proteins to secretary organelles in the mammalian epithelial cells.<br>
Much attention has been paid in the last few years to zinc absorption by infants fed on different milks. The average zinc content of bovine milk is 3.5 mg/   L   and   it   is   associated   with   skim   milk   fraction   and   over<br>
95% is associated with casein micelles. It has been proposed that the relatively high Zn- binding capacity of casein, together with its relatively poor digestibility, could lead to the formation of complexes of Zn(II) with undigested casein and render a significant portion of Zn(II) unavailable for absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the apparent nutritional significance of the zinc-casein interaction the nature of Zn(II) binding by caseins has received little study.<br>
Milk essentially carried or have the capacity to retain only 4mg/L of zinc but the required amount of Zinc as per RDA values is 15.5 mg/L. So there is a need to increase the capacity of zinc intake so that efficient biofortification is possible.<br>
The present invention related to a process for preparation of Zn -alpha casein complex<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent 6,849,595 wherein Calorically dense nutritional composition by Mark, et al. (February 1, 2005) the generated composition is for metabolically stressed people the drawbacks of this patent applicants are that they have used milk fat and whey hydrolysate along with 225% more zinc than specified by USRDA for normal humans was included as this product. This product according to the applicants is only for patients and disorder people. This product cannot be specified for the normal growing children and the infants, because of ingredients present in large excess. This product is not having wider applicability. All the ingredients specified here are in large excess as required for normal human beings based on the specifications of USRDA which can have serious hyper nutrient implication for normal growing children and humans fed on this product.<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent 6,797,293 by Shin, et al. (September 28, 2004) where in there is use of enriched milk with capsules containing nutrients the drawbacks are milk is used as a vehicle for biofortification and with nutrients enclosed in capsules. This patent emphasizes only on the deficient nutrients and method to enrich them. The nutrients are encapsulated and made easy for ingestion. Among the nutrients there is mention of zinc but there are no details about the amount added and the methodology therein. Applicants have made this enriched milk based on Korean population as the recommended daily intake for Korean people is taken for formulations. The capsules are made up of variety of compounds like gelatin, agar, sorbitol where some are digestible in stomach and some in intestine. The effect of these materials on the digestive enzymes or vice versa has not been discussed.<br>
