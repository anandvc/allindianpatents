				<td>FAIL-SAFE POWER CONTROL APPARATUS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fail-safe power control apparatus as<br>
defined in the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Prior art<br>
Transport systems, such as elevator systems, are traditionally provided with<br>
a separate control system for controlling the transport system and a separate<br>
safety system for ensuring the safety of the transport system.<br>
The control system of an elevator system comprises at least an elevator<br>
motor, an elevator controller and a power control apparatus for supplying<br>
power to the elevator motor. The elevator controller comprises an elevator<br>
group control function and functions for the handling of car calls and landing<br>
calls.<br>
The safety system of an elevator system comprises a safety circuit, which<br>
comprises a series circuit of one or more safety contacts that open in a<br>
failure situation, and safety devices activated upon opening of the safety<br>
circuit, such as a machine brake or a car brake. Moreover, the safety system<br>
may comprise, among other things, an overspeed governor which, in the<br>
case of an overspeed, activates the safety gear of the elevator car, and<br>
terminal buffers at the ends of the elevator shaft.<br>
During recent years, the safety regulations concerning transport systems<br>
have changed and it has become possible in terms of regulatory technology<br>
to replace various mechanical safety devices with corresponding electric<br>
safety devices.<br>
Specification US 6,170,614 discloses an electronic overspeed governor<br>
which can be used to replace a mechanical, centrifugally operated overspeed<br>
governor in an elevator system. The electronic overspeed governor<br>
measures the velocity or position of the elevator car and, upon concluding<br>
that an overspeed of the elevator car is occurring, activates a stopping<br>
device, such as a safety gear, of the elevator car to stop it.<br>
Specification EP 1,159,218 discloses an electronically implemented safety<br>
circuit for an elevator system. The traditional elevator-system safety circuit<br>
with a series connection of safety contacts has been modified by using an<br>
arrangement whereby the state of the safety contacts or corresponding<br>
sensors is measured and transmitted by serial transfer to a separate<br>
controller. This modification of the safety circuit is approved in the new<br>
elevator-system safety standards concerning electric safety equipment, in the<br>
so-called PESSRAL standards.<br>
Replacing separate mechanical safety devices, or safety devices<br>
implemented using mechanical switches, such as relays, with corresponding<br>
electronic safety devices does not essentially reduce the number of safety<br>
devices. The basic function of the safety devices is still based on measuring<br>
specific transport system parameters, such as the velocity or position of the<br>
transporting equipment, and inferring from the measured parameters whether<br>
a failure of the transporting equipment may have occurred. For example, if a<br>
dangerous failure occurs in a power control apparatus, such as an inverter<br>
controlling the motor of the transporting equipment, this failure is only<br>
detected after a delay e.g. by the overspeed governor when the speed of the<br>
transporting equipment has increased to a dangerous level exceeding the<br>
limit value of the highest allowed velocity.<br>
Specification US 2003/0150690 A1 discloses a fail-safe control apparatus<br>
provided with two channels for monitoring the speed of a transport system<br>
and for stopping the system.<br>
Specification US 2006/0060427 A1 discloses fail-safe control apparatus<br>
provided with two controllers for monitoring the speed of a transport system<br>
and for stopping the system.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to disclose a failure-safe power control<br>
apparatus which is so arranged that a possible failure situation of the<br>
transport system can be detected substantially earlier than is possible when<br>
prior-art transport system safety systems are used. At the same time, it is an<br>
object of the invention to disclose an apparatus that will enable the safety<br>
system of a transport system to be made considerably simpler than prior-art<br>
safety systems. A safety system containing a fail-safe power control<br>
apparatus according to the invention contains fewer separate safety devices<br>
than prior-art safety systems do.<br>
Features of the invention<br>
The fail-safe power control apparatus of the invention is characterized by<br>
what is stated in the characterizing part of claim 1. Other embodiments of the<br>
invention are characterized by what is stated in the other claims. Inventive<br>
embodiments are also presented in the description part of the present<br>
application. The inventive content disclosed in the application can also be<br>
defined in other ways than is done in the claims below. The inventive content<br>
may also consist of several separate inventions, especially if the invention is<br>
considered in the light of explicit or implicit sub-tasks or with respect to<br>
advantages or sets of advantages achieved. In this case, some of the<br>
attributes contained in the claims below may be superfluous from the point of<br>
view of separate inventive concepts.<br>
The present invention concerns a fail-safe power control apparatus for a<br>
transport system. Fail-safe in this context refers to an apparatus which is so<br>
designed that failure takes place safely in such manner that the failure of the<br>
apparatus will in no circumstances cause a danger to the users of the<br>
transport system controlled by the power control apparatus.<br>
The transport system concerned by the invention may be e.g. an elevator<br>
system, an escalator system, a moving walkway system or a crane system.<br>
The term 'transport system' here refers to the entire system intended for<br>
transportation, such as an elevator system, whereas the term 'transporting<br>
equipment' refers to a system component, such as an elevator car, used for<br>
actual transportation.<br>
The power control apparatus of the invention for supplying power between an<br>
energy source and the motor of a transport system comprises a power supply<br>
circuit comprising at least one electronic power converter containing<br>
controllable change-over switches. The power control apparatus comprises<br>
at least a first and a second controller adapted to communicate with each<br>
other, which controllers comprise altogether at least one converter control<br>
function. The power control apparatus comprises the control of at least one<br>
braking device. At least the first and the second controllers comprise inputs<br>
for transporting-equipment motion signals, monitoring of the motion of the<br>
transporting equipment, and outputs for control signals for at least one<br>
braking device. Transporting equipment motion signal' refers to a signal<br>
indicating a motional state of the transporting equipment, such as<br>
acceleration, velocity or position of the transporting equipment. Such a signal<br>
may be e.g. the measurement signal of an encoder or acceleration sensor<br>
measuring the motion of the transporting equipment. Correspondingly,<br>
'monitoring the motion of the transporting equipment' refers to monitoring of<br>
the motional state, such as acceleration, velocity or position, of the<br>
transporting equipment. 'Determination of a motion reference for the<br>
transporting equipment' means determining a reference value / set of<br>
reference values for the motional state, such as acceleration, velocity or<br>
position, of the transporting equipment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at least the first controller comprises<br>
inverter control, while at least the second controller comprises adjustment of<br>
the speed of the transporting equipment. In this case, the first and second<br>
controllers comprise inputs for measurement signals indicating transporting<br>
equipment velocity and / or position, as well as monitoring of the velocity and<br>
/ or position of the transporting equipment.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, the first and second<br>
controllers contain safety diagnostics. 'Safety diagnostics' refers to<br>
monitoring or control designed according to a specific safety procedure, such<br>
as a computer program, and / or control electronics designed in accordance<br>
with a safety procedure.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a failure situation of the aforesaid safety<br>
diagnostics is determined on the basis of motion monitoring of the<br>
transporting equipment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a failure situation of the aforesaid safety<br>
diagnostics is determined on the basis of the communication between the<br>
first and the second controllers.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, at least the first and<br>
the second controllers comprise outputs for control signals for a first and a<br>
second braking device. In this case, the first braking device may be a<br>
machine brake mechanically engaging the axle or drive sheave of the motor<br>
of the transporting equipment. The second braking device may also be a<br>
machine brake engaging the said motor, or e.g. a brake which is<br>
mechanically engaged between the elevator car and a guide rail of the<br>
elevator car, such as a rail brake or an overspeed-governor wedge brake.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, a communication<br>
bus is arranged between the first and the second controllers. The second<br>
controller is adapted to send to the first controller a message at<br>
predetermined time intervals, and the first controller is adapted to send upon<br>
receiving the message a reply message to the second controller within a<br>
predetermined period of time. Upon detecting a deviation of the interval<br>
between messages or reply messages from the predetermined limit values,<br>
both controllers are adapted to perform independently of each other an action<br>
to stop the transport system.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, both the message<br>
and the reply message contain at least the following data items: velocity<br>
and/or position measurement data read by the controller sending a message<br>
or reply message; notification regarding a fault detected by the controller<br>
sending a message or reply message; and a control command to at least one<br>
braking device. Upon detecting a deviation between the control commands to<br>
a braking device or between the velocity and/or position measurement data<br>
of the controllers, or upon receiving a message regarding a fault detected,<br>
both controllers are adapted to perform an action independently of each other<br>
to stop the transport system.<br>
A power control apparatus according to the invention comprises interruption<br>
of the power supply circuit, in which case at least the first and the second<br>
controllers comprise an output for a control signal for interrupting the power<br>
supply circuit.<br>
A power control apparatus according to the invention comprises control<br>
means for controlling the change-over switches of the converter, said control<br>
means comprising a power source at least for control energy controlling the<br>
positive or negative change-over contacts. In this case, the interruption of the<br>
power supply circuit comprises two controllable switches fitted in series with<br>
the power source for interrupting the supply of control energy, and the first<br>
controller is adapted to control the first switch and the second controller is<br>
adapted to control the second switch to interrupt the supply of control energy.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the control of at least one braking device<br>
comprises two switches fitted in series in a brake control circuit, the first<br>
controller comprises an output for the control signal of the first switch and the<br>
second controller comprises an output for the control signal of the second<br>
switch, and both the first and the second controllers comprise inputs for data<br>
indicating the positions of the first and the second switches.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, the first controller<br>
comprises an output for a first pulse-shaped control signal and the second<br>
controller comprises an output for a second pulse-shaped control signal. The<br>
first controller comprises an input for the measurement of the second pulse-<br>
shaped control signal, and the second controller comprises an input for the<br>
measurement of the first pulse-shaped control signal. In this embodiment of<br>
the invention, the control of at least one braking device comprises an input<br>
for the first and second pulse-shaped control signals, and the control of the<br>
said braking device is adapted to supply control power to the braking device<br>
only via simultaneous control by the first and the second pulse-shaped<br>
control signals.<br>
A power control apparatus according to the invention comprises a data<br>
transfer bus, which comprises at least a first data bus, in which the first<br>
controller is adapted to communicate. Another power control apparatus<br>
according to the invention comprises, in addition to the first data bus, a<br>
second data bus, in which the second controller is adapted to communicate.<br>
In this case, the power control apparatus further comprises a transmitter<br>
connected to the first data bus for the transmission of a first motion signal of<br>
the transporting equipment and a transmitter connected to the second data<br>
bus for the transmission of a second motion signal of the transporting<br>
equipment. In this embodiment of the invention, the first and the second<br>
controllers are adapted to compare the first and the second motion signals<br>
read by them parallelly from the data buses and, upon detecting that the<br>
signals differ from each other by more than a certain limit value, to perform<br>
an action to stop the transport system. The aforesaid first and second data<br>
buses may be wired or wireless buses. In wireless data buses, data can be<br>
transferred in the form of e.g. an electromagnetic signal or an ultrasound<br>
signal.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the data transfer bus comprises a<br>
transmitter connected to the first data bus for the transmission of status data<br>
of a safety contact of the transport system and a transmitter connected to the<br>
second data bus for the transmission of status data of a safety contact of the<br>
transport system.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, the converter control<br>
comprises a motor driving mode, and at least the first controller is adapted to<br>
switch alternatively the positive or the negative change-over contacts of the<br>
converter to a conducting state for dynamic braking of the motor in a situation<br>
where the state of the converter control differs from the motor driving mode.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, the monitoring of the<br>
velocity and / or position of the transporting equipment comprises in<br>
connection with the first controller an envelope curve of a first maximum<br>
allowed velocity and in connection with the second controller an envelope<br>
curve of a second maximum allowed velocity. In this case, the first and the<br>
second controllers are adapted to compare the measured velocity with the<br>
value of the corresponding envelope curve of the maximum allowed velocity<br>
and, upon detecting a difference exceeding a predetermined limit value<br>
between the measured velocity and the envelope curve value, to perform an<br>
action to stop the transport system.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the second controller, upon detecting a<br>
difference exceeding a predetermined limit value between the measured<br>
velocity and the value of the envelope curve of the maximum allowed<br>
velocity, is adapted to send to the first controller a motor-torque set value to<br>
stop the transport system with predetermined deceleration.<br>
A power control apparatus according to the invention is adapted, upon<br>
detecting a difference exceeding a predetermined limit value between the<br>
measured velocity and the value of the envelope curve of the maximum<br>
allowed velocity, to stop the motor by converter control with predetermined<br>
deceleration.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, the first controller<br>
comprises mains converter control.<br>
In a power control apparatus according to the invention, at least the first<br>
controller is adapted, upon detecting a failure situation, to interrupt by mains<br>
converter control the supply of power from the energy source to the direct-<br>
voltage intermediate circuit of the power supply circuit.<br>
A power control apparatus according to the invention is adapted to supply<br>
power between an energy source and the motor of an elevator system.<br>
Using the power control apparatus of the invention, power can be supplied<br>
between any energy source and any transport system motor. The motor may<br>
be an electric motor of any type, either a rotating or a linear motor. The<br>
energy source may be e.g. a mains supply or an electricity generator. The<br>
energy source may also be a direct voltage source, such as a battery or<br>
supercapacitor.<br>
The power supply circuit of the power control apparatus of the invention<br>
comprises at least one converter which comprises controllable switches and<br>
which may be e.g. an inverter supplying a voltage of varying frequency and<br>
amplitude to a motor. The power supply circuit may also comprise other<br>
converters, such as a mains converter. In this case, the mains converter<br>
converts the alternating voltage of a mains supply into a direct voltage to the<br>
direct-voltage intermediate circuit of the power supply circuit, and an inverter<br>
again converts the voltage of the direct-voltage intermediate circuit into an<br>
alternating voltage for the motor.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a communication bus is provided between<br>
the first and the second controllers. The second one of the controllers is<br>
adapted to send to the first controller at predetermined time intervals a<br>
message, whose length and content may be predetermined. The first one of<br>
the controllers is adapted to send a reply message to the second controller<br>
within a given predetermined period of time. If the first controller detects that<br>
no message arrives from the second controller within the predetermined time<br>
interval, then it concludes that the second controller has failed. Similarly, if<br>
the second controller detects that the first controller does not send a reply<br>
message within the predetermined period of time, it concludes that the first<br>
controller has failed. In such a case, the controller having detected a failure<br>
situation is able to perform an action to stop the transport system on its own<br>
accord, independently of the other controller, which it has concluded to have<br>
failed. An 'action to stop the transport system' refers to stopping the transport<br>
system in a controlled manner with predetermined acceleration or stopping<br>
the transport system by actuating at least one stopping device, such as a<br>
machine brake or a braking device of an elevator car. The action to stop the<br>
transport system may also comprise an action to prevent restarting of the<br>
transport system, e.g. by setting at least the first or the second controller into<br>
an operating state where release of the brake and / or starting of the motor is<br>
inhibited. The time interval between successive messages to be transmitted<br>
and the allowed time delay of the reply message are typically so short that a<br>
failure of a controller can be detected essentially before this could cause a<br>
danger situation in the transport system. The time interval between<br>
successive messages may be e.g. 10 milliseconds.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the change-over switches used in the<br>
converter are IGBT transistors. In this case, 'means for controlling the<br>
change-over switches of the converter' refers to signal paths for the control<br>
signals controlling the change-over switches and to means for amplifying the<br>
control signals. These means comprise at least a power source for control<br>
energy for the gate controllers of the IGBT transistors and an amplifier circuit<br>
for amplifying the control signals to the gate of the IGBT transistor. The<br>
change-over switches used may also be controllable switches other than<br>
IGBT transistors, e.g. prior-art MOSFET transistors or GTO thyristors. In this<br>
case, too, the control means may comprise a signal path, a power source for<br>
control energy for controlling the switches and an amplifier circuit for<br>
amplifying the control signals.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the power control apparatus comprises a<br>
function for interrupting the power supply circuit. In an embodiment of the<br>
invention, the interruption of the power supply circuit is implemented by<br>
inhibiting the supply of power to the amplifier circuit comprised in the means<br>
for controlling the change-over switches. This supply of power is inhibited by<br>
means of two controllable switches connected mutually in series, which are in<br>
series with the power source supplying power to the amplifier circuit. The first<br>
one of these switches is controlled by the first controller and the second one<br>
by the second controller. It is thus possible to interrupt the power supply<br>
circuit by either one of the controllers independently the other one. In<br>
addition, the state of the control signal of the second switch can be measured<br>
by the first controller and the state of the first switch by the second controller,<br>
and so the operating state of the power-supply-circuit interruption function<br>
can be verified for correctness via crosswise measurement. The controllable<br>
switches used for the interruption may preferably be MOSFET transistors.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the power control apparatus comprises a<br>
brake control circuit and two controllable switches fitted in series with each<br>
other in the brake control circuit. When at least one of the these switches is<br>
open, the brake control circuit is in an interrupted state and no current is<br>
flowing to the brake coil. The brake is thus engaged, preventing movement of<br>
the transporting equipment. In this embodiment of the invention, the first<br>
switch is controlled by the first controller and the second switch by the<br>
second controller, and thus the brake control circuit can be interrupted by<br>
either controller independently of each other.<br>
The apparatus of the invention may also comprise one or more control<br>
functions for controlling a braking device, which comprise an input for a first<br>
and a second pulse-shaped control signal. The first controller may supply a<br>
first pulse-shaped control signal and the second controller a second pulse-<br>
shaped control signal to each one of the aforesaid braking device control<br>
functions. Each braking device control function is adapted to supply power to<br>
the braking device only upon receiving both the first and the second pulse-<br>
shaped control signals. If either one of the pulse-shaped control signals<br>
ceases, i.e. if the control signal changes into a DC signal, then the control<br>
function controlling the braking device immediately stops supplying power to<br>
the braking device. The braking device now starts braking, thus preventing<br>
movement of the transporting equipment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the power control apparatus comprises a<br>
data transfer bus consisting of two separate data buses. The first controller is<br>
adapted to communicate over the first data bus and the second controller is<br>
adapted to communicate over the second data bus. The controllers are able<br>
to read data simultaneously from the separate data buses of the data transfer<br>
bus, to send the data they have read to each other via the communication<br>
bus between the controllers, to compare the simultaneously read data items<br>
to each other and thus to verify the correctness of the data. For example,<br>
there may be fitted to the first data bus a first measuring unit, which<br>
measures the acceleration, velocity or position of the transporting equipment<br>
and sends via its transmitter the measured data regarding the acceleration,<br>
velocity or position of the transporting equipment over the first data bus to the<br>
first controller. Fitted to the second data bus there may be a second<br>
measuring unit, which measures the acceleration, velocity or position of the<br>
transporting equipment and sends via its transmitter the measured data<br>
regarding the acceleration, velocity or position of the transporting equipment<br>
over the second data bus to the second controller. The controllers can<br>
perform a mutual comparison between the measurement data of the first and<br>
the second measuring units and, upon detecting between the measurement<br>
data a difference exceeding a maximum allowed limit value, conclude that<br>
one of the measuring units has failed. In this case, the power control<br>
apparatus can perform an action to stop the transport system and prevent<br>
restarting of operation, e.g. by stopping the transporting equipment with<br>
predetermined acceleration and / or by actuating at least one stopping<br>
device.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the power control apparatus is adapted to<br>
read the status of at least one safety switch of the transporting equipment.<br>
Fitted in conjunction with the safety switch is an electronic reading unit, which<br>
reads the status of the safety switch and transmits it separately into the first<br>
and the second data buses. The first and the second controllers read the<br>
status of the safety switch and compare the status data to each other. In this<br>
way, by comparing the status data, it is possible to verify the correctness of<br>
the safety switch status data. Safety switches like these include e.g. landing-<br>
door safety switches in an elevator system and comb-plate safety switches in<br>
an escalator system.<br>
At least the first controller in the power control apparatus according to the<br>
invention comprises a converter control stage. The converter control may<br>
comprise different operating modes, such as a motor driving mode, which<br>
means a mode wherein at least the first controller adjusts the torque of the<br>
motor of the transport system according to the speed reference as far as<br>
possible. The converter control may also comprise a dynamic braking mode,<br>
and the converter control may be adapted to enter the dynamic braking mode<br>
each time upon exiting the motor driving mode. In the dynamic braking mode,<br>
at least the first controller can control alternatively the positive or the negative<br>
change-over contacts of the converter to the conducting state, thus activating<br>
prior-art dynamic braking of the motor.<br>
In this context, 'change-over switch' refers to two controllable switches fitted<br>
in series between the positive and negative current rails of the direct-voltage<br>
intermediate circuit in the power supply circuit. 'Positive change-over contact'<br>
means the one of the switches which is fitted to the positive current rail and<br>
'negative change-over contact' means the switch fitted to the negative current<br>
rail.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the first and the second controllers<br>
comprise envelope curves for the maximum allowed velocity. The values of<br>
the envelope curve of the maximum allowed velocity may vary as a function<br>
of position of the transporting equipment, e.g. in such manner that the limit<br>
values are smaller in absolute value when the transporting equipment is<br>
approaching the end limits of movement. Further, the limit values may vary<br>
according to the desired velocity of the transporting equipment, i.e. according<br>
to the speed reference, in such manner that the limit values are always<br>
higher in absolute value than the absolute value of the speed reference,<br>
according to either a predetermined constant value or a scaling factor greater<br>
than unity. In an embodiment of the invention, the first and the second<br>
controllers make separate comparisons between the velocity of the<br>
transporting equipment and the value of the envelope curve of the maximum<br>
allowed velocity. If the first or the second controller detects that the measured<br>
velocity of the transporting equipment differs by more than a predetermined<br>
limit value, they can perform an action to stop the transport system<br>
independently of each other.<br>
The controllers mentioned in the invention may be e.g. microcontrollers or<br>
programmable FPGA (field programmable gate array) circuits. The<br>
controllers may also be implemented using discrete components, such as<br>
logic circuits.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The advantages achieved by the invention include at least one of the<br>
following:<br>
- the number of separate safety devices is reduced, the overall system<br>
being thus simplified. The reliability of the overall system is improved<br>
and the costs are reduced.<br>
- as the stopping devices are not directly controlled by mechanical<br>
switches but the switch statuses are measured and the measurement<br>
data may be filtered, system reliability problems due to transient<br>
interruptions of the switches are reduced.<br>
- as the power control apparatus takes care of safe stopping of the<br>
elevator in a centralized manner, the apparatus can, based on the<br>
inference it has made, bring the elevator car to a standstill with a<br>
predetermined deceleration and e.g. park the elevator car at the<br>
nearest floor, thus letting the passengers to leave the elevator car, or,<br>
if the situation so requires, the power control apparatus can actuate at<br>
least one stopping device to stop the elevator car as quickly as<br>
possible.<br>
- the controllers included in the power control apparatus can monitor<br>
each other's operation and, upon detecting a failure situation, control<br>
the elevator car so as to bring it immediately to a standstill, the<br>
reaction time of the system in the case of a failure of the power control<br>
apparatus being thus shortened.<br>
- when the motor is to be controlled by the power control apparatus, the<br>
controllers need to calculate a set value, i.e. a motion reference, for<br>
the elevator car movement as a function of distance or time. When the<br>
extreme limits of allowed movement are to be monitored, forming the<br>
extreme limits from this motion reference does not require much<br>
calculation. For example, the envelope curve of the maximum allowed<br>
velocity used in overspeed control can be easily generated from the<br>
set value of velocity as a function of distance or time, i.e. from the<br>
speed reference, e.g. via linear scaling in a prior-art manner, so the<br>
calculation of the envelope curve can be performed faster, which<br>
again saves calculation capacity of the controllers.<br>

Embodiment examples<br>
The following example is a description of an elevator system provided with a<br>
fail-safe power control apparatus.<br>
Fig. 1 represents a fail-safe power control apparatus according to the<br>
invention. The power supply circuit 6 comprises a mains converter 8 and an<br>
inverter 7. The mains converter converts a sinusoidal mains voltage 4 into a<br>
direct voltage, which is passed to the direct-voltage intermediate circuit 23 of<br>
the power supply circuit. The direct-voltage intermediate circuit comprises an<br>
energy storage 22 for smoothing the voltage. The inverter 7 converts the<br>
direct voltage into a variable-frequency and variable-amplitude voltage for<br>
feeding a motor 5. The mains supply is additionally provided with a main<br>
switch 16.<br>
A second controller 2 measures the motor speed 13 and adjusts the<br>
measured speed according to a speed reference 59 as far as possible by<br>
transmitting via a communication bus 17 a motor-torque set value<br>
corresponding to the difference between the speed reference and the velocity<br>
measurement to a first controller 1. The first controller 1 adjusts the motor<br>
torque via its converter control function by controlling the change-over<br>
switches 32 of the inverter 7.<br>
The second controller 2 sends the velocity value it has measured to the first<br>
controller 1 as a message via the communication bus 17. The first controller<br>
likewise measures the velocity 12 and sends the velocity value thus obtained<br>
as a reply message to the second controller via the communication bus. Both<br>
controllers compare the velocity measurements to each other and, upon<br>
detecting a difference exceeding a predetermined limit value between the<br>
measurements, perform an action to bring the elevator system to a safe state<br>
independently of each other. An 'action to bring the elevator system to a safe<br>
state' here means stopping the elevator car with a predetermined<br>
acceleration or by actuating at least one braking device. The first and the<br>
second controllers independently calculate an envelope curve 58 of the<br>
maximum allowed velocity. This is accomplished by scaling the set value of<br>
velocity, i.e. the velocity reference of the elevator car by a constant value<br>
greater than unity. In addition, the first and the second controllers compare<br>
the measured velocity values 12, 13 to the envelope curve of the maximum<br>
allowed velocity and, if the velocity measurement exceeds the value of the<br>
envelope curve, then the controllers perform independently of each other an<br>
action to bring the elevator system to a safe state.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the velocity of the elevator car is<br>
measured by two encoders engaging the traction sheave of the elevator<br>
motor 5, but the measurement of elevator movement can also be arranged<br>
e.g. in such manner that the first controller 1 measures the motion of the<br>
elevator car e.g. by means of an acceleration sensor or encoder attached to<br>
the elevator car while the second controller 2 measures the motion of the<br>
motor 5 by means of an encoder coupled to the rotating axle or traction<br>
sheave. It is thus possible to detect via comparison of the measurements of<br>
elevator car movement e.g. the occurrence of an elevator rope breakage.<br>
However, it is also possible for both the first 1 and the second 2 controller to<br>
measure the elevator car movement, e.g. by means of sensors connected<br>
directly to the elevator car or to a rope pulley of the elevator overspeed<br>
governor.<br>
To bring the elevator system to a safe state, either one of the controllers can<br>
actuate at least one braking device 44, 45 independently of each other. The<br>
control of the braking devices is so arranged that, for the brake to be<br>
released, a congruent control command is required from each controller. If no<br>
control command is obtained from either one of the controllers, then the<br>
brake is not released.<br>
If bringing the elevator system to a safe state does not require immediate<br>
closing of the brake, then the second controller may send to the first<br>
controller a set value of the torque of the elevator motor to stop the elevator<br>
car with a predetermined deceleration 60. The first controller can also stop<br>
the elevator car with a predetermined deceleration independently of the<br>
second controller by controlling the motor torque via converter control.<br>
The fail-safe power control apparatus also comprises a data transfer bus 10.<br>
Via the data transfer bus, the first 1 and the second 2 controllers can read<br>
sensors, such as the positions of safety switches 57, in the elevator system.<br>
The first and second controllers can compare the said position data and thus<br>
verify the operating condition of the measurements. Based on the<br>
measurements, the first and / or the second controller can perform an action<br>
to bring the elevator system to a safe state when necessary.<br>
The first 1 and the second 2 controllers can independently interrupt the<br>
power supply circuit 6 by inhibiting the control of the negative 34 and / or<br>
positive 33 change-over contacts of the change-over switches of the inverter<br>
7. In addition, the second controller can prevent the mains inverter 8 from<br>
supplying power from the mains supply 4 to the direct-voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 23 by sending an inhibition command to the first controller. The first<br>
controller can inhibit the supply of power from the mains to the direct-voltage<br>
intermediate circuit by controlling the mains inverter 8 via mains inverter<br>
control in such manner that no power flows into the direct-voltage<br>
intermediate circuit 23.<br>
The mains inverter 8 may be a thyristor bridge, in which case the first and<br>
second controllers can interrupt the supply of power from the mains 4 to the<br>
direct-voltage intermediate circuit 23 by preventing the flow of current to the<br>
gates of the thyristors in the thyristor bridge.<br>
Fig. 2 visualizes the timing of the messages in the communication bus 17<br>
between the first 1 and the second 2 controllers. The second controller 2<br>
sends a message 19 to the first controller. The message is transmitted at<br>
regular intervals 18. The first controller 1 sends a reply message 20 to the<br>
second controller 2 within a predetermined period of time 21 after receiving<br>
the message 19. If the first controller detects that no message 19 arrives<br>
from the second controller at predetermined regular intervals 18, the first<br>
controller can infer that the second controller has failed and perform an<br>
action to bring the elevator system to a safe state. Similarly, if the second<br>
controller detects that the first controller does not send a reply message 20<br>
within the predetermined period of time 21, the second controller can infer<br>
that the first controller has failed and perform an action to bring the elevator<br>
system to a safe state.<br>
Fig. 4 represents the interruption of the power supply circuit 6. The<br>
interruption circuit comprises two controllable switches 25, 31, which can be<br>
used to prevent the supply of power to the amplifier circuit 29 amplifying the<br>
control signals 30 of the change-over contacts. The first controller controls<br>
switch 25 by means of control signal 26, and the second controller controls<br>
switch 31 by means of control signal 27. Since the switches 25, 31 are in<br>
series, both the first 1 and the second 2 controller can independently interrupt<br>
the power supply circuit 6 by opening the switch and thus preventing the<br>
supply of power to the amplifier circuit 29.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the control of a braking device. The braking device is<br>
controlled by supplying a magnetizing current to a magnetizing coil 36 of the<br>
braking device 36. The brake is released when current is flowing in the coil.<br>
The brake control circuit 39 contains two controllable switches 37, 38<br>
arranged in series. When either one of the switches is opened, the flow of<br>
current to the magnetizing coil is interrupted, thus preventing release of the<br>
brake. The first controller 1 controls the first switch 37 by means of control<br>
signal 40, and the second controller 2 controls the second switch 38 by<br>
means of control signal 41. Each controller can independently open the brake<br>
control circuit and thus prevent release of the brake. In other words, for the<br>
brake to be released, congruent control is required from both controllers 1, 2.<br>
Fig. 7 represents a brake control arrangement 11. The brake control<br>
arrangement comprises a transformer 50 with two magnetizing coils on the<br>
primary side and one output coil on the secondary side. The currents in the<br>
magnetizing coils is controlled by alternately switching the switches 51, 42<br>
controlled by a pulse-shaped control signal, the first switch 51 being<br>
controlled by the first controller 1 and the second controllable switch 42 by<br>
the second controller 2. For the output coil to feed power to the magnetizing<br>
coil 44 of the braking device, the transformer 50 must be alternately<br>
magnetized and demagnetized by the magnetizing coils. For this reason, the<br>
pulse-shaped control signals 14, 15 from the first and second controllers<br>
must be in opposite phase so that the switches 51 and 42 are alternately<br>
turned on and off. If either one of the controllers starts producing a DC signal<br>
instead of a pulse-shaped control signal, thereby ceasing to control the<br>
magnetization, then the supply of power to the magnetizing coil 44 of the<br>
braking device ceases and the brake is engaged.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates control arrangements 11, 43 used to control the magnetizing<br>
coils of a first 44 and a second 45 braking device. The first 1 and the second<br>
2 controllers control the first 11 and the second 43 brake control<br>
arrangements simultaneously in such manner that, for power to be supplied<br>
to the magnetizing coils 44, 45 of the braking devices, the first and second<br>
controllers are required to produce a pulse-shaped control signal 14, 15. In<br>
addition, the first controller 1 has an input 48 for the measurement of the<br>
pulse-shaped control signal produced by the second controller 2, and the<br>
second controller 2 has an input 49 for the measurement of the control signal<br>
produced by the first controller. In this way, the controllers can measure the<br>
operating state of the brake control and verify the operating reliability.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates the control of the magnetizing coils 44, 45 of the braking<br>
devices. The first controller 1 has outputs for a control signal 14 for the first<br>
brake control arrangement 11 and for a control signal 46 for the second<br>
brake control arrangement 43. The second controller 2 has outputs for a<br>
control signal 15 for the first brake control arrangement 11 and for a control<br>
signal 47 for the second brake control arrangement 43. In this embodiment,<br>
the first and second magnetizing coils 44, 45 can be controlled independently<br>
of each other by pulse-shaped control signals.<br>
Fig. 10 represents the data transfer bus 10 of the power control apparatus.<br>
The data transfer bus comprises a first data bus 52, over which the first<br>
controller 1 is fitted to communicate, and a second data bus 53, over which<br>
the second controller 2 is fitted to communicate. Connected to the data<br>
transfer bus are transmitters, such as a transmitter 54 for transmitting a first<br>
measurement 12 of elevator car velocity into the first data bus 52 and a<br>
transmitter 58 for transmitting a second measurement 13 of elevator car<br>
velocity into the second data bus 53. In addition, there may be connected to<br>
the data transfer bus e.g. transmitters 55, 56 for transmitting position data<br>
indicating the positions of safety switches in the elevator system into the first<br>
and second data buses. Examples of such safety switches of the elevator<br>
system are the landing-door safety switches.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates the operation of the safety diagnostics of the controller. The<br>
controller 1,2 determines a first error situation 70, such as a failure signal or<br>
functional deviation. The controller 1,2 then makes an inference 71 as to<br>
whether the error situation involves a hazard. If necessary, the controller sets<br>
the program execution into operation inhibition mode 78, in which case an<br>
action for stopping the transport system is carried out and in addition<br>
restarting of the transport system is inhibited. If the error situation does not<br>
require a transition into operation inhibition mode 78, the controller can still<br>
either stop the transport system 72, in which case the program execution<br>
enters a stopped state 79 where restarting of the transport system is allowed,<br>
or it can allow the transport system to continue operating in the normal<br>
manner. If the controller subsequently detects a second error situation 80, it<br>
again performs an inference in a corresponding manner to determine<br>
whether the error situation involves a hazard 73, 74, whereupon the<br>
controller either sets the transport system into operation inhibition mode 78,<br>
performs normal stopping 79 of the transport system, or allows normal<br>
operation of the transport system. After a third error situation 81, a similar<br>
inference procedure 75, 76 is repeated once more, and if after this a new<br>
error situation 82 follows, the transport system is stopped and the program<br>
execution is set either into an operation inhibition mode 78 as defined in the<br>
safety diagnostics software or into a stopped mode 79 permitting restarting.<br>
The invention has been described above with reference to a few embodiment<br>
examples. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the invention is not<br>
exclusively limited to the embodiments described above, but that many other<br>

in the claims.<br>
