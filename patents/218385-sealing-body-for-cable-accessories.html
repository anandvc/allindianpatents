Sealing body for cable accessories<br>
The invention relates to a sealing body for cable accessories made of thermoplastic synthetic material with cable entrance openings in a separation plane of the split sealing body and with a cable catch apparatus.<br>
A sealing body for cable accessories made of thermoplastic synthetic material split lengthwise is known from EP 0 408 967 Bl, in which, if needed, cable entrance openings can be cut into a separation plane. The sealing body consists of successive lamellae, wherein pressure plates are directed into the interstices between the lamellae, which pressure plates are pressed against the cable sheath inserted cable by inwardly operative pressure means. In this sort of cable catch apparatus, the respective cable is constricted to an acceptable degree and is thereby fixed in its lengthwise direction. Here, however, the pressure plates directed between the sealing lamellae have to be adapted to the respective cable entrance opening. If subsequent cable insertions are required with a sealing body arrangement of this sort, the entire sealing system has to be dismantled, additional cable entrance openings have to be cut and, finally, the seals have to be replaced.<br>
The goal of the present invention is to provide a sealing body for cable accessories in which it is possible to subsequently provide cable entrances which are independent of cable seals already installed, wherein one has to take into account that every subsequently inserted cable can be caught with a cable catch apparatus. The goal is now met according to the<br>
invention by providing a sealing body for cable accessories made of thermoplastic material comprising cable entry holes (KEU) in a separating plane (TE) of the split sealing body and with a cable catch apparatus, having cable entrances (KEN) arranged outside the region of separating plane (TE) of the sealing body (DK), and with these cable entrances (KEN) provided with closures (KEV) which can be disconnected as and<br>
when required, characterized in that;<br>
-	the cable entrances (KEN) having inner threads (G) on both end sides,<br>
-	in each of the cable entrances (KEN) with closures (KEV), a pressure bushing<br>
(AH) with an outer thread (AG) and an inwardly directed fore surface provided<br>
with toothed profiles (ZSF), a toothed disk(ZS) provided on both sides with<br>
toothed profiles, a sealing bushing (DH) made of elastic material and a thrust<br>
bearing bushing (GH) with an outer thread (AG) are arranged one after another; and,<br>
-	guide profiles (F) are arranged on a fore surface of the sealing body (DK) for the<br>
use of cable catch apparatus (KA) for every inserted cable (K).<br>
The advantages of the instant invention as regard to a sealing body for the cable<br>
accessories particularly to be seen in that cable entrances can be subsequently occupied in<br>
already equipped cable accessories without damaging the existing cable entrance systems<br>
in the separation plane. In addition, cable catch apparati are provided that are allocated to<br>
every cable entrance, and can be adapted in their position to the diameter of the inserted<br>
cable. The cable catch apparati can be connected with one another in a conductive<br>
manner by corresponding connections so that shieldings can be combined. The sealing<br>
body is split and cable entrance openings are arranged in a known manner in the<br>
separation plane for the first insertion, above all as well for the insertion of uncut cables.<br>
The cable entrances which may be subsequently required are, in contrast, first provided<br>
with a fastener. According to the invention, these cable entrances are each outfitted with a<br>
compression sealing system in which a sealing bushing made of elastic material and<br>
roughly adjusted according to the diameter of the cable is used. This sealing bushing is<br>
pressed in an axial direction from both sides by a pressure bushing and a  thrust<br>
baaring bushing, wherein a seal over a large surface between the inserted cable and the wall of the cable entrance results due to the change in shape. A particularity of this inventive seeling system is also to be seen in the fact that, by insertion of a toothed disk between the pressure bushing anci the sealing bushing, an escapement against unintended loosening of the pressure bushing is achieved. Here, the systeir. is designed in the manner of a ratchet in thar the screwmg-in of the pressure bushing is possible, while the unscrewing is inhibited.<br>
The cable catch apparati on the individual cable entrances co.nsist in principle of ertachment arches on which each of th
Sealing bodies according to the invention can be"used with cable accessories split lengthwise as well as with hood-shaped cable accessories.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail by means ci eight figures.<br>
Fi.gure 1 shows a split sealing body- with, designs according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a closed cable entrance for cables to on subsequently inserted.<br>
Figure 3 shows the use of the single elements in a cable entrance.<br>
Figure 4 shows a sealing upon introduction of the cable of largest possible cable diameter.<br>
Figure 5 shows the sealing" upon insertion of a cable with a small cable diameter.<br>
Figure 6 shows the schematic construction of a cable insertion apparatus in perspective representation.<br>
Figure 7 shows the use of a cable catch apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 8 shows the cable catch apparatus according to the invention.<br>
The sealing body is shown in figure 1, which sealing body is provided with cable entrances KEN according x.o   the invention, which cable entrances KEN do not lie in the separation plane TE and, in particular, serve for the introduction of branch cables or cables to be subsequently inserted. Since these cable entrances KEN lie outside of the separation plane TE, the original cable entrance openings KEU can remain untouched in the retrofitting. The cable entrance openings KEU are, however, also suitable for the.  passage of uncut cable since they lie in the separation plane. Here, conventional sealing systems in the form of successive lamellae of the sealing bo<iy with an inserted sealing strip are also used. the systems for between branch cables or subsequently and walls of cable entrances ken provided to this end on other hand different. here a bushing visible is used which pressed axially such that takes place over></iy>
a large surface area due to the deformation of the elastic Tiaterial. It is also shown in this figure that additional passages DU are provided which, depending on need, are equipped with valves, ground passages or the like, wherein they are first closed.<br>
Figure 2 shows rhe cross-section of a cable entrance KSN toi the insertion of a cut cable, preferably for subsequent need. Emerging from this figure is zhe fact that, for rhe case that it is not used, the cable entrance KEN is provided v^iuh a fastener KEV which-can be removed according to need. Such a fastener KEV can be formed as a removable wall or for example also as filling. Inner threads G are provided on the border areas of the cable entrance KEN, in which a pressure bushinq and a thrust bearing bushing can be axially screwed xn. The middle region between both of the inner threads G is provided for the sealing region in which a sealing bushing is pressea. Guides Fl, F2, F3 can be recognized on the inner end side of the sealing body DK, which guides are a component of cable catch apparati which are allocated to the individual cable entrances KEN as well as to the original cable entrance openings KEU. These guides Fl, F2, F3 form pair wise undercut guide grooves FNl, °FN2, FN3 into which attachment tongues of the cable catch apparati area are slidingly inserted following the introduction, fixing and sealing of the cables. Such a slidcable seating of the cable catch apparati allows the adjustment to different cable diameters, wherein a mcvement in -he axial direction is not possible. In this way, a ca1:ching of pressure and tugging forces is achieved. The catching of torsion forces is also provided for since the attachnent tongues set into the guide grooves do not allow a rotation.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cable entrance KEN equipped with the single sealing elements. This sealing system is composed of a pressure bushing AH with an outer thread and a toothlike<br>
profiled fore side facing a toothed disk ZS, which are successively arranged in the axial direction outward to inward. Connected to this is a sealing bushing DH made of elastic naterial, wherein the inner diameter of this sealing bushing DH corresponds roughly to the diameter of the cable to be inserted. A thrust bearing bushing GH forms the inner end, which thrust bearing bushing GH serves as the thrust bearing upon pressing the sealing bushing DH by the pressure bushinc AH. It also emerges from this figure that the teethed surface cf the pressure bushing AH formed at the fore side zorrr.-firs to the profiling of the toothed disk ZS. The second inwardly pointing side of the toothed disk ZS is supported by the fore side of the sealing bushing DH and is pressed into the elastic material of the sealing bushing DH by the contact pressure generated by the screwing-in of the pressure bushing AK. In this way it is achieved that, due to the sharp leading edge o.l the toothed profiling, a turning back and, therefore, an undesired loosening of the contact pressure, is only very difficultly possible. In addition, the sharp interlocking leading edges of the toothed disk ZS and the fore side of tne pressure bushing AH do not allow a reverse turning, as   is Kinown in the sort of design of a ratchet.<br>
Figure 4 conveys the sealing circumstances in one of the previously shown cable entrance KEN upon insertion of a cable KG with a large, here the largest possible, outer diameter. It becomes clear that it is just barely still possible to insert rhe cable KG into the pressure bushing AH. The inner diameter of the sealing bushing DHG is also chosen corresponding to this, the walls of which sealing bushing D.HG are pressed against the inner walls of the cable enrranee KEN "and against the cable sheath of the cable KG upon screwing-in cf the pressure bushing AH. Here, the sealing ex-ends along the entire length of the sealing bushing DHG. The thrust bearing bushing GK serves as a thrust bearinc.<br>
Figure 5 explains the sealing circumstances upon insertion of the cable KK with a small diameter, so that the cable KK runs within the pressure bushing AH and within the thrust bearing bushing GH with corresponding free space. The sealing bushing DH is on the other hand roughly adapted to the diameter of the cable KK in the sealing region, so that once again a form fitting surface pressing can take place over the entire region. Flange rings AR are formed at the ends of the sealing buishing DH, which flange rings AR are adapted to the inner diameter of the pressure bushing AH and the thrust bearing bushing GH. This way an axial shaping of the sealing bushing DK is prevented.<br>
Figure 6 shows a cable entrance KEN in the sealing body DK, which cable entrance KEN is equipped wirh the sealing assenbly according to the invention, wherein the sequence of the individual parts and their shapes is rendered better recognizable by the perspective representation. The pressure bushing AH with its outer thrread AG is screwed into the inner thread (not visible here) of the cable entrance KEK, wherein the fore surface provided with toothed profilings is pointed inwards. This fore surface ZSF impinges on the toothed disk ZS which is also provided with corresponding toothed profilings, whereby the lock and freeing effect already described is achieved. The second fore surface of the toothed disk ZS is set against the sealing bushing DH and effects the inhibitory effect by engaging in the elastic material of the sealing bushing. Here, the sealing bushing DH is provided for cables with a small diameter; for this reason flange rings AR are formed on the fore sides. The thrust bearing bushing GH finally follows at the end of the sealing system, which thrur.t bearing bushing GH is provided with an outer thread AG and in screwed into the cable entrance KEN. Guides F are further<br>
shown, into which a catch apparatus according to the invention can be inserted.<br>
The use of a cable catch apparatus KA according to the invention is shown in figure 7. It consists of an approximately hemispherically bent attachment arch BB with which even the strongest cable can be bridged. Attachment tongues BL are formed on this attachment arch BB, with which attachment tongues 3L the cable catch apparatus KA  can be hung into undercut guide grooves of the guide profiles F on the sealing body DK. The cable catch apparatus can be moved within the guide grooves FN perpendicular to the insertion direction, so that in this way an adaptation to the diameter of the inserted cable K can take place. The cable K is fixed on a fixing tongue FL of the attachment arch BB with the help of a retainer strap SB. The fixing tongue FL is provided with a recess A in which the retainer strap SB is fed. In this way a fixing in the lengthwise direction is sufficiently provided. Further, the attachment arch BB is provided with flanges AVS for connection rails or connection lines, via which an electrically conductive connection of all cable catch apparatJ KA can be established.<br>
A cable catch apparatus KA according to the invention is shown in figure 8 and is composed of the attachment arch 3B and the bent attachment tongues BL, for example here three attachment: tongues BL. Flanges AVS for connection rails VS or connection lines are formed on these attachment tongues BL. The fixing tongue FL comprises a recess A for insertion of a retainer strap, whereby a lengthwise slipping is prevented.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
