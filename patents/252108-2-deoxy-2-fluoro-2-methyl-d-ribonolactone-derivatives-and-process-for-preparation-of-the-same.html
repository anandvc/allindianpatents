				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides (i) a process for preparing a 2-deoxy-2-<br>
fluoro-2-methyl-D-ribonolactone derivative, (ii) conversion of the lactone to<br>
nucleosides with potent anti- HCV activity, and their analogues, and (iii) a method to<br>
prepare the anti-HCV nucleosides containing the 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methyl-β-<br>
D-ribofuranosyl nucleosides from a preformed, preferably naturally-occurring,<br>
nucleoside.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In light of the fact that HCV infection has reached epidemic levels<br>
worldwide, and has tragic effects on the infected patients. Presently there is no<br>
universally effective treatment for this infection and the only drugs available for<br>
treatment of chronic hepatitis C are various forms of alpha interferon (IFN-a), either<br>
alone or in combination with ribavirin. However, the therapeutic value of these<br>
treatments has been compromised largely due to adverse effects, which highlights<br>
the need for development of additional options for treatment.<br>
HCV is a small, enveloped virus in the Flaviviridae family, with a positive<br>
single-stranded RNA genome of~9.6 kb within the nucleocapsid. The genome<br>
contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of just over<br>
3,000 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature structural and<br><br><br>
nonstructural viral proteins. ORF is flanked by 5' and 3' non-translated regions<br>
(NTRs) of a few hundred nucleotides in length, which are important for RNA<br>
translation and replication. The translated polyprotein contains the structural core<br>
(C) and envelope proteins (E1, E2, p7) at the N-terminus, followed by the<br>
nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B). The mature<br>
structural proteins are generated via cleavage by the host signal peptidase. The<br>
junction between NS2 and NS3 is autocatalytically cleaved by the NS2/NS3<br>
protease, while the remaining four junctions are cleaved by the N-terminal serine<br>
protease domain of NS3 complexed with NS4A. The NS3 protein also contains the<br>
NTP-dependent helicase activity which unwinds duplex RNA during replication.<br>
The NS5B protein possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity,<br>
which is essential for viral replication. It is emphasized here that, unlike HBV or<br>
HIV, no DNA is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
U. S. Patent Application (Serial No. 10/828,753) discloses that l-(2-deoxy-2-<br>
fluoro-2-C-memyl-β-D-ribofuranosyl)cytosine (14) is a potent and selective anti-<br>
HCV agent. The original synthetic procedures (Schemes 1 - 3) are quite inefficient,<br>
with overall yields at or below 4% and are not amenable to large-scale.<br><br><br><br><br>
What is needed is a novel and cost effective process for the synthesis of 2-C-<br>
alkyl-2-deoxy-2-substituted-D-ribopyranosyl nucleosides that have activity against<br>
HCV.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

an amino acid residue), cycloalkyl, optionally substituted alkynyl of C2-C6,<br>
optionally substituted lower alkenyl of C2-C6, or optionally substituted acyl.<br>
In other aspects, the present invention provides methods to prepare<br>
nucleosides containing the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methyl-D-ribofuranosyl moiety of<br>
general structures of III and IV,<br><br><br>
through (i) synthesis of the 3,5-protected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methyl-D-ribono-γ-<br>
lactone intermediate of general structure V, (ii) conversion of V into purine and<br>
pyrimidine nucleosides of general structures of III and IV, and (iii) preparation of<br>
nucleosides of general structures of III and IV from preformed, preferably natural,<br>
nucleosides.<br><br>

be independently H, Me, Acyl (such as Ac, Bz, substituted Bz), benzyl, substituted<br>
benzyl, Trityl, Trialkylsilyl, t-Butyldialkylsilyl, t-Butyldiphenylsilyl, TIPDS, THP,<br>

of formula V and processes for the preparation of the lactone intermediates as<br>
detailed below, including precursor ester intermediates as also detailed below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Presently no preventive means against Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C<br>
virus (HCV), Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) or Yellow Fever virus<br>
(YFV), infection is available. The only approved therapies are for treatment of HCV<br>
infection with alpha interferon alone or in combination with the nucleoside ribavirin,<br>
but the therapeutic value of these treatments has been compromised largely due to<br>
adverse effects. It was recently discovered that a group of nucleosides, including 2'-<br>
deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methylcytidine (14), exhibit potent and selective activity<br>
against replication of HCV in a replicon system. However, the difficulty of chemical<br>
synthesis of this and analogous nucleosides impedes further biophysical,<br>
biochemical, pharmacological evaluations mandatory for development of clinical<br>
drugs for treatment of Flaviviridae infection.<br><br>
The present invention provides an efficient preparation of nucleosides<br>
containing the 2-deoxy-2-fiuoro-2-C-niethyl-D-ribofuranosyl moiety III and IV,<br>
through (i) synthesis of intermediate the 3,5-protected 2-deoxy-2-fiuoro-2-C-methyl-<br>
D-ribono-γ-latone of general structure V, (ii) conversion of V into purine and<br>
pyrimidine nucleosides of general structures of III and IV, and (iii) preparation of<br>
nucleosides of general structures of III and IV from preformed, preferably natural, <br>
nucleosides.	<br>

PREPARATION OF THE COMPOUNDS<br>
(i) Synthesis of 3,5-Di-O-protected-D-ribono-γ-lactone<br>
Wittig reaction of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde 39 (Scheme 4)<br>
with commercially available 40 affords the (E)-product 41 as a major product.<br>
Sharpless dihydroxylation (J. Org. Chem. 1992,57,2768-2771) using AD-mix-β as<br>
a dihydroxylation reagent gives only the desired product 42 in very high yield. High<br>
yield lactonization of 42 to 2-C-methyl-D-arabino-γ-lactone (46) is achieved by<br>
HCl/MeOH treatment. Selective O-benzoylation of primary and secondary OH<br>
groups yields 3,5-di-O-benzol derivative 47 in high yield. Treatment of 47 with<br>
DAST or Deoxofluor, [bis(2-methoxyethyl)amino]sulfur trifluoride, under various<br>
conditions gives trace amounts of the desired 2'-fluoro-ribono-γ-lactone 49, but<br>
mostly a mixture from which the non-fluorinated ribonolactone (48) is isolated.<br>
However, treatment of 47 with excess, preferably three (3) equivalents, of tertiary<br>
amine, preferably diisopropylethylamine, and excess, preferably five (5) equivalents,<br>
of DAST or Deoxofluor provides 49 in ~50% yield. It was also found that using 3,5-<br>
O-MOM instead of benzoyl protection, the yield of 48 approaches 90%. Thus,<br>
treatment of 46 with dimethoxymethane in the presence of strong acid such as<br>
trifluoromethylsulfonic acid affords 50, which upon reaction with DAST or<br>
Deoxofluor in the presence of base yielded 87% isolated yield of 49.<br>
It was also discovered that smooth fluorination can occur upon treatment of<br>
the open-chain monobenzoate 43, which can be readily obtained by selective<br>
benzoylation of 42, with DAST or Deoxofluor giving rise to the desired ethyl 2-<br>
deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methyl-3-O-benzoyl-4,5-O-isopropylidene-D-ribonate 44.<br>
Lactonization of 44 gives only the γ-lactone 45. Further benzoylation of 45 affords<br>
dibenzoate 49.<br><br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for the<br>
synthesis of intermediate 49 through Reformatsky condensation of 39 with an alkyl<br>
2-bromopropionate such as 53 (Scheme 5) in the presence of activated zinc in an<br>
ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (or a mixture of the two<br>
solvents) to give 54, which is converted to 55 by oxidation. Possible oxidizing<br>
agents are: activated dimethylsulfoxide, such as a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide,<br>
trifluoroacetic anhydride or acetic anhydride (a Swern/Moffat oxidiation); chromium<br>
trioxide or other chromate reagent; Dess-Martin periodinane; or<br>
tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) with or without molecular sieves. This<br>
oxidation to provide the C-3 ketone preferably proceeds without affecting the<br>
stereochemistry at C-4.<br>
Fluorination of 55 is performed at the 2-position using an electrophilic<br>
fluorination ("F+") in an appropriate solvent such as dimethylformamide,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, tert-butanol, or diethyl ether or any combination of these<br>
solvents known to those skilled in the art (Rozen, et. al., J. Org. Chem., 2001,66,<br>
7646-7468; Jun-An Ma and Dominique Cahard, Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,<br><br>
2004, in press, and references cited therein), to afford 56. Some non-limiting<br>
examples of electrophilic fluorinating reagents are Selectflour®, N-fluorosulfonimide<br>
(NFSI), and AcOF. Stereoselective fluorination can be achieved by using a catalyst<br>
such as an asymmetric transition metal complex catalyst as taught by Sodeoka, et al.<br>
(JP2004010555) or by other catalysts. The starting β-keto ester 55 may also be first<br>
converted to a ketene silyl acetal prior to fluorination (Rozen, et. al., J. Org. Chem.,<br>
2001,66,7646-7468).<br>
Selective reduction of the C-3 ketone 56 using triphenylsilane in the presence<br>
of a Lewis acid such as AlCl3 or in the presence of an organic acid such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (Kitazume, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1987, 52, 3218-3223) provides<br>
two 2,3 anti products 57 and 58. However, by utilizing a stereoselective fluorination<br>
combined with the selective reduction, a good yield (with high diastereomeric<br>
excess) of 58 can be achieved. Benzoylation of 58 gives 44 which is converted to<br>
lactone 45 as described earlier.<br><br>
(ii) Preparation of nucleosides containing 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-3-methyl-D-<br>
ribofuranosyl moiety by condensation.<br>
A lactone such as 49 can be reduced to the corresponding sugar with DIBAL-<br>
H. After acetylation of the anomeric hydroxyl group, 59 (Scheme 12) is obtained in<br>
high yield. Condensation of 59 with silylated base (e.g., silylated N4-<br>
benzoylcytosine under Vorbrüggen's conditions) affords a mixture of protected<br>
anomeric nucleosides 60 and 60-a. After separation of the anomers, the desired β-<br>
nucleoside 14 is prepared by deprotection with metal alcoholate in alcohol,<br>
preferably NaOMe/MeOH, or methanolic ammonia.<br><br><br>
Compound 59 can be converted into the bromo sugar 61, (Scheme 7) which<br>
is condensed with a sodium salt of purine, e.g., sodio-N6-benzoyladenine to give the<br>
corresponding protected purine nucleoside 62. The desired free nucleoside 63 is<br>
readily obtainable by saponification.<br><br>
(iii) Synthesis from preformed nucleosides:<br>
Using preformed nucleosides as starting materials for preparation of the<br>
desired 2'-C-alkyl-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-β-D-ribonucleosides has certain advantages,<br>
as the formation of anomers and their subsequent separation can be circumvented,<br>
resulting in high yields of the targeted nucleosides.<br><br>
Two procedures to prepare the desired nucleoside 14 from nucleoside<br>
starting materials have been disclosed (Schemes 2 and 3). As mentioned earlier,<br>
however, these procedures also produced two undesirable products 22 and 23, the<br>
latter produced by neighboring group participation as shown in Scheme 8. The<br>
separation of the desired nucleoside 14 from the mixture is rather cumbersome.<br>
Thus, this invention prevents production of 23 using non-participating protecting<br>
group, such as THP, methyl, ethyl, benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl-, benzyloxymethyl,<br>
phenoxymethyl, methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, mesyl, tosyl, trifluoroacetyl,<br>
trichloroacetyl, at the 3'-OH group.<br><br>
An example is shown in Scheme 17. When N4,5'-O-dibenzoyl-3'-O-mesyl-<br>
2'-deoxy-2'-C-methyl-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (64) is treated with DAST or<br>
Deoxofluor, the desired fluorinated product 65 is obtained in 54% yield along with<br>
the olefin 66 in 39% yield. As expected, no unfluorinated cytidine derivative 67 is<br>
formed in detectable amounts. There are several ways to de-protect 65 to 14. An<br>
example is shown in Scheme 9 that requires a double inversion of the 3'-<br>
configuration.<br><br><br>
When the 3'-O-substituent is a non-participating and non-leaving group, such<br>
as methoxymethyl (MOM), methyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or tetrahydropyranyl, the<br>
intermediate is fluorinated more effectively than 64.<br>
The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention but<br>
are not to be limited thereto.<br>
Experimental: 2,3-O-Isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde (39) is prepared by<br>
literature procedures (Organic Synthesis, Annual Volume 72, page 6; J. Org. Chem.<br>
