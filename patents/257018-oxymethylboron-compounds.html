After completion of the reaction of the above each method, and each step , an obj ective compound of each step can be collected from a reaction mixture according to a conventional method.<br>
For example, when a whole reaction mixture is liquid, a reaction mixture is optionally returned to room temperature, or an acid, an alkali, an oxidizing agent or a reducing agent is appropriately added to neutralize under cooling (ice cooling to -78°C) , an organic solvent such as water and ethyl acetate which is not miscible, and does not react with an objective compound is added and a layer containing the objective compound is separated.  Then, a solvent which is not miscible with the<br><br>
resulting layer, and does not react with the objective compound is added, a layer containing the objective compound is washed, and the layer is separated. In addition, when the layer is an organic layer, the layer is dried using a drying agent such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate or anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent is distilled off to collect the objective compound. On the other hand, when the layer is an aqueous layer, the layer is electrically desalted, and lyophilized, thereby, the objective compound can be collected.<br>
In addition, when a whole reaction mixture is liquid, and if possible, an objective compound can be collected only by distilling off substances other than the obj ective compound (e.g. solvent, reagent or the like) under a normal pressure or reduced pressure.<br>
In addition, when a whole reaction mixture is liquid, and if possible, a reaction mixture can be purified by using various chromatographies (thin layer chromatography, column chromatography or the like) to collect the objective compound.<br>
Further, when only an objective compound is precipitated as a solid, or when the whole reaction mixture is liquid, and only an objective compound is precipitated as a solid during a process of collection, first, an obj ective compound is filtered by a filtration method, a filtered objective compound is washed with an organic solvent or an inorganic solvent such as water, and is dried. In addition, by treating a mother liquor as in the case where the whole reaction mixture is liquid, an obj ective compound can be further collected.<br><br>
In addition, further, when only a reagent or a catalyst is present as a solid, or when the whole reaction mixture is liquid, and only a reagent,or a catalyst is newly precipitated as a solid during a process of collection, and an objective compound is dissolved in a solution, first, the reagent or the catalyst is filtered off by a filtration method. The reagent or catalyst which has been filtered off is washed with a suitable organic or inorganic solvent, the resulting washing solution is combined with a mother liquor, and the resulting mixed solution is treated as in a case where the whole reactionmixture is liquid, thereby, an objective compound can be collected.<br>
In particular, when substances other than an objective compound contained in the reaction mixture do not inhibit a reaction of a next step, the reaction mixture as it is may be used in the next step without particularly isolating the obj ective compound,<br>
In order to improve a purity of the objective compound collected by the Producing Process A or C, a recrystallization method, various chromatography methods , or a distillationmethod can be appropriately performed. When the collected objective compound is a solid, usually, a purity of the objective compound can be improved by a recrystallization method. In the recrystallization method, a single solvent or a mixture of plural solvents which do not react with the objective compound can be used. Specifically, first, the obj ective compound is dissolved in a single or plural solvents which do not react with an obj ective compound at room temperature or under heating.  By cooling the<br><br>
resulting mixed solution with ice-water or the like , or allowing to stand it at room temperature, the objective compound can be precipitated from the mixed solution.<br>
When the collected objective compound is liquid, a purity of the objective compound can be improved by various chromatography methods.  Generally, weakly acidic silica gels such as silica gel 60 (70 to 230 mesh or 340 to 400 mesh) manufactured by Merck &amp; Co. , Inc. and silica gel 60 (0.040 to 0.050 mm) manufactured by Kanto Chemical Co. , Inc. can be used. When the obj ective compound is acidic and unstable, neutral silica gel 60N (0.10 to 0 . 21 mm) manufactured by Kanto Chemical Co . , Inc . may be used.  When the obj ective compound has basicity, propylamine-coated silica gel (NH-silica gel column chromatography)(200 to 350 mesh) manufactured by Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd. may be used.  In addition, when the objective compound has a structure of a zwitterion, or when elution with a highly polar solvent such as methanol and the like is necessary, NAM-200H or NAM-300H manufactured by NAM Laboratory may be used. Using these silica gels, the objective compound is dissolved with single or plural solvents which do not react with the objective compound, and the solvent is distilled off, thereby, the objective compound with an improved purity can be obtained.<br>
When the collected objective compound is liquid, a purity of the objective compound may be also improved by a distillation method. In the distillation method, the objective compound can be distilled by subjecting the objective compound to reduced pressure at room temperature or under heating.<br><br>
