FOR DELIVERY OF OSTEOGENIC PROTEINS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subject invention relates to the field of osteogenic proteins and<br>
pharmaceutical formulations thereof. More particularly, the subject invention<br>
involves injectable or implantable solid pharmaceutical formulations<br>
comprising hyaluronic acid derivatives and osteogenic proteins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Idiopathic osteoporosis is a disease of unknown etiology characterized<br>
by progressive loss of bone mass and increased fragility, resulting in a<br>
marked increase in susceptibility to fractures. Osteoporosis is among the<br>
most prevalent of all musculoskeletal disorders, afflicting fifty-six percent of<br>
women over 45 years of age. Praemer et al., Musculoskeletal Conditions in<br>
the United States, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Park Ridge,<br>
IL (1992). Because its incidence increases with age and the percentage of<br>
elderly in the population is increasing, osteoporosis will become more<br>
common with time. Osteoporosis is difficult to treat locally, and there is<br>
presently no known cure. Finally, and most significantly, osteoporosis is<br>
associated with a substantial morbidity and mortality. The most serious<br>
fracture resulting from osteoporosis is that of the proximal femur in the region<br>
of the hip joint. With an annual incidence of over 300,000, hip fractures are<br>
currently the most common fracture in the elderly. One out of every six<br>
Caucasian women will have a hip fracture during her lifetime (Cummings et<br>
al., Arch Intern Med 149:2455-2458 (1989)), and for those who attain the age<br>
of 90, this figure becomes one in three.<br>
Of the patients who are independent and living at home at the time of<br>
hip fracture, approximately 20 percent remain in a long term care institution for<br>
at least one year following the fracture. During the first year following injury,<br>
the mortality rate is approximately 15 % higher than for age and gender<br>
matched controls. Praemer et al., supra. The increased incidence of proximal<br>
femur fracture observed in elderly patients is mainly related to a decreased<br>
bone density of their proximal femora, as well as an increased propensity to<br>
fall. There is an inverse relationship between the age-related bone loss in the<br>
proximal femur and the risk of hip fracture. Each decrease of one standard<br>
deviation (SD) in femoral neck bone density increases the age-adjusted risk of<br>
hip fracture 2.6 times (95% CI 1.9 - 3.6), and women with bone density in the<br>
lowest quartile have an 8.5-fold greater risk of hip fracture than those in the<br>
highest quartile. Cummings et al., The Lancet 341:72-75 (1993). This<br>
relation between hip bone mass and hip fracture risk allows the screening and<br>
identification of patients at risk for fracture. Patients who are two standard<br>
deviations below peak hip bone mass have passed beneath the "fracture<br>
threshold."<br>
Current therapies for osteoporosis are systemic. These include<br>
fluoride, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, estrogens and progestins, testosterone,<br>
vitamin D metabolites, and/or calcium. In the United States, only estrogens<br>
and alendronate, a bisphosphonate, are indicated for the prevention of hip<br>
fractures in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Each of these agents<br>
requires continuous administration over a time period of years.<br>
In addition to treating osteoporotic bone, a need exists for methods of<br>
treating or preventing osteoporosis-related fractures, for example by local<br>
administration of osteogenic proteins. Because of this need, despite the<br>
variety and availability of carrier materials for delivering osteogenic proteins, a<br>
need also exists for safe, effective and generally applicable carriers for local<br>
treatment of bone defects. Accordingly, despite substantial endeavors in this<br>
field, there remains a need for an effective method of repair and/or treatment<br>
of osteoporotic and osteopenic bone, and for minimizing or reducing the<br>
incidence or severity of osteoporosis-related fractures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides injectable or implantable solid, rod-<br>
shaped compositions for intraosseous delivery of osteogenic proteins. In one<br>
embodiment, the composition comprises the osteogenic protein and<br>
hyaluronic acid esters. In another embodiment, the composition may further<br>
comprise a bone resorption inhibitor such as a bisphosphonate. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the composition may further comprise one or more<br>
excipients, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polysaccharide,<br>
peptide, protein, amino acid, synthetic polymer, natural polymers, or<br>
surfactant. The solid, rod-shaped injectable or implantable compositions of<br>
the invention provide prolonged retention of the osteoinductive agent at the<br>
site of administration.<br>
The present invention further provides methods and compositions for<br>
increasing bone mass and quality, and for minimizing or reducing the<br>
incidence or severity of osteoporosis-related fractures. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention provides methods and compositions useful for decreasing<br>
the incidence of fractures of osteoporotic or osteopenic bone. In particular,<br>
the present invention comprises methods of treating patients with<br>
osteoporosis, or with other evidence of osteoporosis or osteopenic condition.<br>
Preferred embodiments where the present invention may prove particularly<br>
useful include treatment of metaphyseal bone, including proximal femur (hip),<br>
proximal humerus (upper arm), distal radius (wrist), and vertebral bodies<br>
(spine), particularly the vertebral body.<br>
The method comprises administering to a site of osteopenic or<br>
osteoporotic bone, or a site of low bone mass or density, a solid rod-shaped<br>
composition comprising an effective amount of at least one active agent that<br>
is capable of inducing growth of bone or increasing the formation of bone<br>
tissue or reducing bone loss at the site. Bone mass is commonly designated<br>
"bone mineral content" or "BMC" and is measured in grams. Bone density is<br>
commonly designated "bone mineral density" or "BMD" and is expressed as<br>
grams per unit area or grams per unit volume. In a particular embodiment, the<br>
mode of administration is by intraosseous injection. In illustrative<br>
embodiments, the active agent is one or more proteins selected from the<br>
group of proteins known as the transforming growth factors-beta ("TGF-ß")<br>
superfamily of proteins, preferably selected from the bone morphogenetic<br>
proteins ("BMPs"), the growth and differentiation factors ("GDFs"), as well as<br>
other proteins, as described more fully herein. The methods and<br>
compositions of the present invention are advantageous in that they provide a<br>
localized treatment for osteoporosis or osteopenic bone, rather than systemic<br>
treatment. The present invention is further advantageous in that it utilizes as<br>
active agents osteogenic proteins, which may be produced via recombinant<br>
DNA technology, and therefore are of potentially unlimited supply. The<br>
methods and compositions of the present invention are further advantageous<br>
in that regeneration of the bone tissue increases the bone mass/density,<br>
increase the bone strength, and thereby reduce the severity of osteoporosis<br>
or incidence of osteoporotic lesions, ultimately lessening the incidence of<br>
bone fractures.<br>
In other embodiments, the active agent further comprises, in addition to<br>
one or more proteins selected from the TGF-ß superfamily of proteins, one or<br>
more auxiliary proteins, such as Hedgehog, Noggin, Chordin, Frazzled,<br>
Cerberus and Follistatin, soluble BMP receptors, or other protein or agent, as<br>
described further herein.<br>
The present invention further provides a methods for increasing bone<br>
mass and quality, and for minimizing or reducing the incidence or severity of<br>
osteoporosis-related fractures, by administering an injectable rod-shaped<br>
composition comprising at least one osteogenic protein and a second<br>
composition comprising an effective amount of a bone resorption inhibitor.<br>
The second composition comprising the bone resorption inhibitor may be<br>
administered prior to, after, or substantially simultaneously with the osteogenic<br>
composition.<br>
In addition to healing of osteoporotic bone, compositions of the present<br>
invention may be useful for injectable formulations of BMPs for uses such as<br>
injection into joints for treatment and repair of osseous defects, cartilage<br>
defects, inhibition of cartilage degradation and to promote cartilage repair.<br>
The formulations may also be injected into tendons, ligaments and/or their<br>
attachment sites to bone. Injectable formulations of BMPs may also find<br>
application to other bone sites such as bone cysts, implants into bones,<br>
closed or open fractures and distraction osteogenesis.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the compositions of the present invention<br>
are prepared by a process comprising the steps of mixing an osteogenic<br>
protein and a hyaluronic acid derivative to form an osteogenic mixture. The<br>
osteogenic mixture is then formed, for example by extruding the osteogenic<br>
mixture into air or a nonsolvent such as ethanol, and drying. The<br>
compositions of the invention may further comprise a bone resorption inhibitor<br>
and/or an excipient, either or both of which may be included in the mixing<br>
step.<br>
The hyaluronic acid derivative may be a natural or synthetic hyaluronic<br>
acid, or a modification thereof. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally-occurring<br>
polysaccharide containing alternating N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-<br>
glucuronic acid monosaccharide units linked with beta 1-4 bonds and the<br>
disaccharide units linked with beta 1-3 glycoside bonds. It occurs usually as<br>
the sodium salt and has a molecular weight range of about 50,000 to 8 x 106.<br>
The bone resorption inhibitor may be a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate,<br>
cimadronate, clodronate, EB-1053, etidronate, ibandrohate, neridronate,<br>
olpadronate, pamidronate, risedronate, tiludronate, YH 529, zoledronate, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, and mixtures thereof. The<br>
excipient may be an agent that stabilizes and/or modulates release of the<br>
active ingredient(s), such as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
polysaccharide, peptide, protein, amino acid, synthetic polymer, natural<br>
polymers, and/or surfactant. The osteogenic protein can be in a solid or liquid<br>
form, and the hyaluronic acid derivative and excipient(s) can be in a solid<br>
form. The molding may be accomplished by extruding the osteogenic mixture<br>
into air or a nonsolvent such as ethanol; the drying may accomplished by air-<br>
drying or freeze-drying. The sustained-release preparation may further<br>
comprise a bone resorption inhibitor such as a bisphosphonate.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for preparing an<br>
injectable sustained-release preparation comprising the steps of admixing an<br>
osteogenic protein with a hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan-based material to<br>
form an admixture, compressing the admixture to form a dense osteogenic<br>
admixture, then forming the dense osteogenic admixture into a solid<br>
cylindrical rod suitable for injecting or implanting into a body. The forming<br>
step may be performed by extruding, pressing, molding, boring and/or cutting<br>
to form a cylindrical rod. The injectable sustained-release preparation may<br>
further comprise a bone resorption inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate, and<br>
one or more excipients, such as those described above.<br>
The injectable, solid, osteoinductive compositions of the present<br>
invention may have a diameter of between about 0.1 to 3.0 mm, and<br>
preferably between about 0.5 to 1.5 mm. The length of the solid rod-shaped<br>
compositions may be between about 1 mm and about 10 cm, and particularly<br>
between about 2 cm and about 5 cm. The compositions of the present<br>
invention may have a height to diameter ratio within the range of about 1000:1<br>
to 1:1. This ratio may be about 1000:1, 500:1,250:1, 100:1, 50:1,25:1, 10:1,<br>
5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1 or 1:1. The osteoinductive compositions of the present<br>
invention are rigid (but not brittle) to withstand loading into a conventional<br>
needle or syringe, and injection into an intraosseous site. The osteoinductive<br>
compositions have a density of between about 0.5 and 100 percent material,<br>
and preferably of between about 50 and 90 percent material. The<br>
compositions have a low macroporosity and a low water content, between<br>
about 0.1 and about 10.0 percent water, and particularly between about 0.1<br>
and about 5 percent water. The proportion of active ingredient to carrier may<br>
be between about 0.01-0.90 gram of active ingredient to about 1 gram of<br>
carrier, and particularly between 0.1-0.3 gram of active ingredient to about 1<br>
gram of carrier. The hyaluronic acid derivative may be a partial or full ester<br>
comprising between about 50 and about 100 percent hyaluronic acid<br>
esterification.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to the present invention, methods and compositions are<br>
provided for treatment of patients who exhibit signs of osteoporosis, or<br>
osteopenic conditions, including osteoporotic bone lesions. The identification<br>
of such patients may be accomplished by procedures that are well known in<br>
the art. These procedures include measurement of bone mass/density using<br>

11:243-249 (1990); and radiographic assessment, Glueret al., J. Bone Min.<br>
Res. 9:671-677 (1994). Other methods of identification of patients at risk of<br>
bone fracture include assessment of age-related factors, such as cognisance,<br>
as well as prior occurrence of osteoporosis-related fractures. Porter et al.,<br>
BMJ 301:638-641 (1990); Hui et al., J. Clin. Invest. 81:1804-1809 (1988). The<br>
above publications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The methods comprise injecting into the osteoporotic or osteopenic site<br>
a solid rod-shaped composition comprising one or more purified osteogenic<br>
proteins, which is effective to induce the formation and/or maintenance of<br>
bone, and a hyaluronic acid as a carrier. Unlike existing injectable<br>
formulations, the osteogenic composition of the present invention is<br>
administered in a solid form, thereby avoiding the deficiencies inherent in<br>
liquid or viscous formulations. For example, using liquid or gel formulations,<br>
the osteoinductive agent may be prematurely diluted by the body fluids before<br>
the bone promoting effect can be achieved. The present invention obviates<br>
the dilution effect by employing a solid carrier that degrades slowly in vivo,<br>
thereby providing delayed, sustained release of the active ingredients).<br>
Furthermore, unlike liquid or viscous formulations that may migrate from the<br>
site of administration, the solid compositions of the present invention become<br>
lodged and persist at the site of desired bone growth to effect the bone growth<br>
promoting activity. Typically, the composition must persist at the site for a<br>
period from about seven days to about six months. If the composition is<br>
dispersed prematurely, the desired bone growth-promotion effect either will<br>
not occur or the formed bone will not have the desired strength. Finally,<br>
although the osteogenic composition of the present invention is administered<br>
as a solid, it is formed as a cylindrical rod, thereby being suitable for either<br>
injection or implantation into the body. In addition, the well-known surgical<br>
complication of inducing an embolism during an intraosseous injection<br>
procedure is considerably mitigated through the use of solid rods (vs. liquid or<br>
gel forms). The potential displacement of intraosseous bone fragments, fat or<br>
an embolism caused by a pressurized injection of a large volume of liquid/gel<br>
carrier is reduced since the volume injected of highly concentrated solid rod<br>
carrier is much less than that required if a similar dose was dispensed in a<br>
liquid or gel form. The composition may be applied to the site of desired bone<br>
growth in any convenient manner, including by introduction through a<br>
conventional hypodermic needle or syringe.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are prepared by mixing the<br>
osteogenic protein, hyaluronic acid carrier and optional excipients to form,<br>
depending upon the hyaluronic acid starting material, either a viscous<br>
liquid/gel or paste. The ensuing mass is then shaped into cylindrical rods and<br>
dried. The shaping may be accomplished using any one of a number of<br>
known techniques, for example by molding, pressing, boring and/or cutting. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the osteogenic mixture is packed into and extruded<br>
through the hub end of a hypodermic syringe. The material is extruded as<br>
continuous cylindrical^ shaped rods, dried at room temperature and<br>
sectioned into small, injectable rods.<br>
If the hyaluronic acid starting material is a hydrophobic solid, such as<br>
Hyaff-11®, the hyaluronic acid is first solubilized in an organic solvent to form<br>
a solution. The organic solvent may be any pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvent, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),<br>
preferably NMP. The solution may comprise between about 1 and about 50<br>
% (w/v) hyaluronic acid, preferably between about 5 and 20 % (w/v), and most<br>
preferably about 10 % (w/v) hyaluronic acid. The dry powdered osteogenic<br>
protein is dispersed in the hyaluronic acid solution at a concentration of<br>
between about 1 and about 50 % (w/w), preferably about 20 % (w/w), and<br>
optional excipients (e.g., amino acids, sugars, salts, surfactants, polymers,<br>
etc.) are added at a concentration of between about 1 and about 50 % (w/w),<br>
preferably between about 20 and about 40 % (w/w). The compositions of the<br>
invention may further comprise a bone resorption inhibitor, which may be<br>
included in the mixing step in dry powder or soluble form, individually or in<br>
combination with the osteogenic protein component<br>
If the hyaluronic acid starting material is in a hydrophilic form, such as<br>
Hyaff-11 p65®, the hyaluronic acid may be blended with an aqueous buffer<br>
comprising optionaf excipients until the mass assumes a paste-like<br>
consistency. The paste-like substance may comprise between about 1 and<br>
about 40 % (w/v), preferably between about 5 and about 30 % (w/v), and<br>
more preferably between about 15 and about 20 % (w/v) hyaluronic acid. In<br>
an exemplified embodiment, the paste-like substance comprises 18.75 %<br>
(w/v) hyaluronic acid. The dry powdered osteogenic protein is then mixed into<br>
the hyaluronic acid paste prior to shaping. Alternatively, rather than blending<br>
with an aqueous buffer comprising optional excipients, the hyaluronic acid<br>
starting material may be blended with an aqueous buffer comprising soluble<br>
osteogenic protein with optional excipients until the mass assumes a paste-<br>
like consistency or a viscous liquid or gel appearance. The compositions may<br>
further comprise a bone resorption inhibitor, which may be included in the<br>
mixing step in dry powder or soluble form, individually or in combination with<br>
the osteogenic protein component.<br>
Once the components have been combined and blended into a paste<br>
or viscous liquid or gel, the osteogenic material is packed into a cylindrical<br>
mold, air or gas-permeable tubing (e.g., silastic or Teflon®/FEP), or extrusion<br>
type apparatus, such as a syringe. If a syringe is used for the forming step,<br>
the plunger of the syringe is inserted and a sufficient amount of pressure is<br>
applied to extrude a continuous length of paste onto a dry surface, in the case<br>
of water soluble hyaluronic acid. In the case of water insoluble hyaluronic<br>
acid, a continuous length of gel is extruded into a nonsolvent bath enabling<br>
precipitation of the material. Sections are then cut using a cutting tool such as<br>
a razor, scalpe), knife or the like, to form injectable, rod-shaped compositions.<br>
After sectioning, the rod-shaped compositions are dried, for example by air<br>
drying or freeze drying.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for preparing an<br>
injectable sustained-release preparation comprising the steps of admixing an<br>
osteogenic protein, a hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan-based material, and<br>
optional excipients to form a dense osteogenic admixture, then forming the<br>
dense osteogenic admixture into a solid cylindrical rod suitable for injecting or<br>
implanting into a body.<br>
The active agent can be selected from the family of proteins known as<br>
the transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-ß) superfamily of proteins, which<br>
includes the activins, inhibins and bone morphogenetic proteins {BMPs). "<br>
Particularly, the active agent includes at least one protein selected from the<br>
subclass of proteins known generally as BMPs, which have been disclosed to<br>
have osteogenic activity, and other growth and differentiation type activities.<br>
These BMPs include BMP proteins BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6<br>
and BMP-7, disclosed for instance in United States Patents 5,108,922;<br>

WO95/01801; WO95/01802; WO94/21681; WO94/15966; WO95/10539;<br>
WO96/01845; WO96/02559 and others. Also useful in the present invention<br>
may be BIP, disclosed in WO94/01557; HP00269, disclosed in JP Publication<br>
number: 7-250688; and MP52, disclosed in PCT application WO93/16099.<br>
The disclosures of all of the above applications are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. A subset of BMPs that are presently preferred for use in the<br>
present invention include BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-10,<br>
BMP-12 and BMP-13. In an illustrative embodiment, the active agent isBMP-<br>
2, the sequence of which is disclosed in United States Patent 5,013,649, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Other BMPs and<br>
TGF-ß proteins known in the art can also be used.<br>
The active agent may be recombinantly produced, or purified from a<br>
protein composition. The active agent, if a TGF-ß such as a BMP, or other<br>
dimeric protein, may be homodimeric, or may be heterodimeric with other<br>
BMPs (e.g., a heterodimer composed of one monomer each of BMP-2 and<br>
BMP-6) or with other members of the TGF-ß superfamily, such as activins,<br>
inhibins and TGF-ß1 (e.g., a heterodimer composed of one monomer each of<br>
a BMP and a related member of the TGF-ß superfamily). Examples of such<br>
heterodimeric proteins are described for example in Published PCT Patent<br>
Application WO 93/09229, the specification of which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The active agent may further comprise additional agents such as the<br>
Hedgehog, Frazzled, Chordin, Noggin, Cerberus and Follistatin proteins.<br>
These families of proteins are generally described in Sasai et al., Cell, 79:779-<br>
790 (1994) (Chordin); PCT Patent Publication WO94/05800 (Noggin); and<br>
Fukui et al., Dev. Biol. 159:131-139 (1993) (Follistatin). Hedgehog proteins<br>
are described in WO96/16668; WO96/17924; and WO95/18856. The<br>
Frazzled family of proteins is a.relatively recently discovered family of proteins<br>
with high homology to the extracellular binding domain of the receptor protein<br>
family known as Frizzled. The Frizzled family of genes and proteins is<br>
described in Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271.4468-4476 (1996). The active<br>
agent may also include other soluble receptors, such as the truncated soluble<br>
receptors disclosed in PCT patent publication WO95/07982. From the<br>
teaching of WO95/07982, one skilled in the art will recognize that truncated<br>
soluble receptors can be prepared for numerous other receptor proteins.<br>
Such would also be encompassed within the present invention. The above<br>
publications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The amount of active agent useful herein is that amount effective to<br>
stimulate increased osteogenic activity of present or infiltrating progenitor or<br>
other cells, and will depend upon the size and nature of the defect being<br>
treated. Generally, the amount of protein to be delivered is in a range of from<br>
about 0.1 to about 500 mg, particularly about 10 to about 300 mg, and more<br>
particularly about 150 to about 250 mg per cubic centimeter of material<br>
required.<br>
Materials which may be useful as the carrier in practicing the present<br>
invention include pharmaceutically acceptable materials having a rigidity such<br>
that, when mixed and dried with a bone morphogenetic protein, form a<br>
composition that possesses appropriate handling characteristics for injectable<br>
or implantable application to the site of osteoporotic or osteopenic bone.<br>
Incorporating the bone morphogenetic protein in a solid carrier allows the<br>
protein to remain in the diseased or lesioned site for a time sufficient to allow<br>
the protein to increase the otherwise natural rate of regenerative osteogenic<br>
activity of the infiltrating mammalian progenitor or other cells, and to form a<br>
space in which new tissue can grow and allow for ingrowth of cells. The<br>
carrier may also allow the bone morphogenetic protein to be released from<br>
the disease or lesion site over a time interval appropriate for optimally<br>
increasing the rate of regenerative osteogenic activity of the progenitor cells.<br>
The carrier may also supply a framework on which to induce new formation in<br>
severely osteoporotic bone.<br>
In illustrative embodiments, the family of carriers comprises hyaluronic<br>
acid esters or hyaluronan-based materials. As used herein, the terms<br>
"hyaluronic acid," "hyaluronan-based material," and "hyaluronic acid<br>
derivatives" are used interchangeably to mean hyaluronic acid (as defined<br>
below) and its salts such as the sodium, potassium magnesium calcium and<br>
the like, salts. After molding and drying, the hyaluronic acid carriers are in a<br>
form suitable for injection or implantation, such as a cylindrical rod, described<br>
in detail below. Such rods are rigid enough to withstand loading into a<br>
conventional hypodermic needle or syringe, as well as injection into an<br>
intraosseous space. Although rigid, the hyaluronic acid-based carrier<br>
materials have high tensile strength and low fragility. The solid rod<br>
compositions of the invention preferably have a relatively high density of<br>
material (30-100%), low macroporosity, and low water content.<br>
Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally in a variety of tissues, including<br>
synovial fluid, vitreous humor, human umbilical cord and cocks" combs. It is<br>
the main component of the intracellular matrix of connective tissues such as<br>
skin, tendons, muscles and cartilage. In addition to providing mechanical<br>
support for the cells of these tissues, hyaluronic acid also facilitates other<br>
important biological functions, including hydration, lubrication, cellular<br>
migration and differentiation (see, e.g., Balazs et al., Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries<br>
5(84):8-17). Hyaluronic acid may be extracted from natural tissues, such as<br>
cocks" combs, or produced by recombinant methods. The molecular weight of<br>
hyaluronic acid obtained by extraction generally ranges from between 8 and<br>
13 million. The polyscaccharide is labile and readily degraded by a variety of<br>
physical (mechanical, radiation) and chemical agents. As a result, ordinary<br>
purification procedures generally produce hydrolyzed fractions of low<br>
molecular weight hyaluronic acids (see Balazs et al., supra).<br>
As used herein, the term "hyaluronic acid" refers to an acidic<br>
polysaccharide comprising D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine<br>
residues, regardless of molecular weight, including mixtures of various<br>
molecular weight fractions and derivatives thereof. Derivatives of hyaluronic<br>
acid include, for example, hyaluronic acid that has been chemically modified<br>
through esterification, cross-linking, sulphation, etc. The hyaluronic acid may<br>
be an ester, such as a methyl ester of a hyaluronic acid as described, for<br>
example, in Jeanloz et al., J. Biol. Chem. 186:495-511 (1950); Jager et al., J.<br>
Bacteriology 1065-1067; Biochem. J. 167:711-716(1977); Jeanloz et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 194:141-150 (1952); or Jeanloz et al., Helvetica Chimica Acta<br>
35:262-271 (1952).<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, the hyaluronic acid is an ester of<br>
hyaluronic acid with aliphatic, aromatic, aroaliphatic, cycloaliphatic or<br>
etherocyclic alcohols, in which all or a portion of the carboxylic groups of the<br>
acid are esterified, such as the hyaluronic acid derivatives described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,336,767, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety<br>
herein. The hyaluronic acid starting materials may be as described in co-<br>
pending U.S. application Serial No. 09/687,283, filed October 13, 2000, which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Particularly, the<br>
hyaluronan-based starting materials are solids such as non-woven pads, felts,<br>
sheets, powders, sponges, and microspheres sold under the tradename<br>
Hyaff® by Fidia Advanced Biopolymers, Abano Terme, Italy. Hyaff® materials<br>
are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,851,521; 4,965,353; and<br>
5,202,431; and EP 0 216 453, all of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entireties herein. The Hyaff® materials are esters of<br>
hyaluronic acid having one or a combination of ester moieties (e.g., benzyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, pentyl, or larger molecules such as hydrocortisone or methyl<br>
prednisone), as well as various degrees of esterification (i.e., partial esters or<br>
complete esters). Partial esters of Hyaff® materials are designated by<br>
percent esterification ranging from 50-99 % (e.g., Hyaff-11p65® and Hyaff-<br>
11p80®), while complete esters are 100 % esters of hyaluronic acid (e.g.,<br>
Hyaff-11®). In addition to providing the desired handling characteristics of the<br>
compositions of the present invention, Hyaff® materials also provide a means<br>
for manipulating the bioavailability and absorption kinetics of the active<br>
ingredient(s) [see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,339,074; 6,232,303; and 6,066,340,<br>
all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties herein].<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, the hyaluronan-based starting<br>
materials are non-woven fabrics comprising mixtures of fibers of hyaluronic<br>
acid esters and natural polymers, semisynthetic derivatives of natural<br>
polymers, and/or synthetic polymers. The mixture may comprise from about 1<br>
to about 100 % hyaluronic acid. Natural polymers useful in the present<br>
invention include, without limitation, collagen, or coprecipitates of collagen<br>
and glycosaminoglycans; cellulose; polysaccharides such as chitin, chitosan,<br>
pectin or pectic acid, agar, agarose, xanthan gum, gellan, alginic acid or<br>
alginates, polymannan or polyglycans, starches, and natural gums.<br>
Semisynthetic derivatives of natural polymers useful in the present invention<br>
include, for example, natural polymers such as collagen cross-linked with<br>
agents such as aldehydes or aldehyde precursors, dicarboxylic acids or<br>
halides thereof, diamines, derivatives of cellulose, alginic acid, starch,<br>
hyaluronic acid, chitin or chitosan, gellan, xanthan, pectin, or pectic acid,<br>
polyglycans, polymannan, agar, agarose, natural gums, and<br>
glycosaminoglycans. Synthetic polymers include, for example, polylactic acid,<br>
polyglycolic acid, polydioxanes, polyphosphazenes, polysulfone resins,<br>
polyurethane resins, and copolymers and derivatives thereof. Exemplary non-<br>
woven fabric materials useful in the present invention, including methods of<br>
making these materials, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,520,916, issued May<br>
28, 1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.<br>
Although much is known about the osteogenic potential of TGF-ß<br>
proteins, recent reports show that local administration of certain<br>
osteoinductive agents, such as BMP-2, stimulates transient osteoclastic<br>
activity at the site of administration. This reaction, which proceeds new bone<br>
formation induced by the BMP, has been termed "transient resorption<br>
phenomenon."<br>
Agents known to inhibit bone resorption may play an important role in<br>
delaying or reducing the initial bone resorption associated with local BMP<br>
administration, without inhibiting the subsequent bone formation. Clinically,<br>
bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to dramatically reduce indices of<br>
bone turnover, increase bone mineral density, and, in osteopenic women,<br>
reduce hip and spine fracture risk (see, e.g., Fleisch, H., Bisphosphonates In<br>
Bone Disease, From The Laboratory To The Patient, 3rd Ed., Parthenon<br>
Publishing (1997), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein).<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, a bone resorption inhibitor such as a<br>
bisphosphonate is co-administered with the osteoinductive agent to prevent or<br>
minimize the initial bone resorption associated with intraosseous delivery of<br>
BMP. The co-administration of bisphosphonate blocks this undesirable<br>
resorption phase, while still allowing the bone augmentation effect to occur.<br>
Despite their therapeutic benefit, bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed<br>
in the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally. To overcome this poor<br>
bioavailability issue, intravenous administration has been used; however, this<br>
modality is seen as costly and inconvenient due to the duration and frequency<br>
of dosing. The present invention overcomes this deficiency by incorporating<br>
the bisphosphonate within a carrier, and delivering it locally directly to the site<br>
of desired action.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the bone resorption inhibitor is<br>
incorporated into the injectable osteoinductive composition as a second active<br>
ingredient. The bone resorption inhibitor may be mixed with the osteogenic<br>
protein, hyaluronic acid carrier, and/or optional excipient(s) prior to the<br>
molding and drying steps. The final mixture is then molded, for example by<br>
extrusion into a nonsolvent or air.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the bone resorption inhibitor is<br>
administered sequentially or concurrently with the osteogenic composition. In<br>
accordance with this embodiment, the osteogenic composition may be<br>
administered locally to a specific area in need of bone growth or repair, with<br>
either the concurrent or sequential administration of the bone resorption<br>
inhibitor in a separate delivery vehicle. Thus, the bone resorption inhibitor<br>
may be injected or implanted directly at the site to be treated, for example, by<br>
injection or surgical implantation in a sustained-release carrier. The carrier<br>
may be any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a wide variety of which are<br>
well known and readily available in the art (see, e.g., Martin, E.W.,<br>
Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., current edition), which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein). Preferably the<br>
carrier is a sustained-release carrier, most preferably the hyaluronic acid<br>
esters or hyaluronan-based materials described above. Presently preferred<br>
carriers are formed into solid rods, as described elsewhere herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "inhibition of bone resorption" refers to<br>
prevention of bone loss, especially the inhibition of removal of existing bone<br>
through direct or indirect alteration of osteoclast formation or activity. Thus,<br>
the term "bone resorption inhibitor" as used herein refers to agents that<br>
prevent or inhibit bone loss by the direct or indirect alteration of osteoclast<br>
formation or activity.<br>
As used herein, the term "bisphosphonate" refers to the related<br>
bisphosphonic acids and salts, and various crystalline and amorphous forms<br>
of bisphosphonate. In a particular embodiment, the bisphosphonate is<br>
selected from the group consisting of alendronate, cimadronate, clodronate,<br>
EB-1053, etidronates, ibandronate, neridronate, olpadronate, pamidronate,<br>
risedronate, tiludronate, YH 529, zolendronate, and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, esters, acids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of bone resorption inhibitor useful herein is that amount<br>
effective to prevent or inhibit the initial bone loss, typically associated with the<br>
local administration of BMP, by the direct or indirect alteration of osteoclast<br>
formation or activity. The precise dosage necessary will depend upon the<br>
size and nature of the defect being treated, as well as the amount of<br>
osteogenic agent being delivered. Generally, the amount of phosphonate to<br>
be delivered is in a range of from about 1 to about 3000 mg, particularly about<br>
10 to about 1000 mg, and illustratively about 100 to about 500 mg per cubic<br>
centimeter of material. The application site is preferably local (intraosseous),<br>
but can be other parenteral sites such as intramuscular or subcutaneous for<br>
systemic delivery.<br>
Additional additives or excipients that may be useful in the<br>
compositions of the present invention include, without limitation,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polysaccharides, peptides, proteins, amino<br>
acids, synthetic polymers, natural polymers, and/or surfactants. Such<br>
excipients are well known in the formulation art to stabilize and/or modulate<br>
release of the active ingredient(s). Useful polymers include, for example,<br>
those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,171,579, the entire disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Synthetic polymers or surfactants include,<br>
without limitation, the pluronics, such as Poloxamer 407 gel, which are a class<br>
of water soluble ABA type block surfactant copolymers which exhibit the<br>
unique property of reverse thermal gelation. Other useful synthetic polymers<br>
include polylactides and polyethylene glycols including<br>
poly(lactide)/poly(ethylene glycol), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene<br>
glycol), polyoxyethylene oxide, carboxyvinyl polymer and polyvinyl alcohol).<br>
Natural polymers include, without limitation, sodium alginate, chitosan,<br>
collagen, gelatin, hyaluronan, and cellulosic materials, such as<br>
hydroxycelluloses. Other useful excipients include peptides, proteins, and<br>
amino acids.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the excipient is present in<br>
powder form, which is then mixed with the active agent(s) into solubilized<br>
Hyaff-11® in organic solvent, and extruded into ethanol (nonsolvent) to form<br>
rods, which are then rinsed and dried. The final composition may contain one<br>
or a combination of excipients, preferably a salt, sugar (e.g., sucrose) and/or<br>
amino acid (e.g., glycine and/or glutamic acid). Compositions of the present<br>
invention may comprise about 1 to about 60 % (w/w) amino acid, about 1 to<br>
about 60 % (w/w) of a sugar, and about 1 to about 60 % (w/w) synthetic<br>
polymer. In another embodiment of the invention, the formulation comprises<br>
about 20-50 % (w/w) amino acid, and/or about 5-50 % (w/w) sugar, and/or<br>
about 20-50 % (w/w) synthetic polymer.<br>
The injectable compositions of the present invention may be<br>
administered in any clinically acceptable manner of injection. A number of<br>
commercially available syringes may be suitable for use in the present<br>
invention, and for administration of the compositions of the present invention.<br>
For example, suitable syringes are available the Catesept® syringe [JS Dental<br>
Manufacturing, Ridgefield CT] comprises sterile calcium hydroxide paste in<br>
isotonic saline solution, in a non-aspirating or modified aspirating cartridge<br>
syringe; Henke-Ject® aspirating syringe and Hypo® dental syringes/needles<br>
[Smith &amp; Nephew MPL, Franklin Park, IL]; intraosseous needles from MPL,<br>
Inc., Chicago IL; and Luer-Lok® Syringes [Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,<br>
NJ], may all be appropriate syringes for use in the present invention. Any<br>
syringe capable of holding and delivering an injectable rod and/or enabling<br>
extrusion with an obdurator is appropriate for use.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the solid rod-shaped compositions<br>
are delivered intraosseously using an appropriate size and type hypodermic<br>
needle percutaneously or surgically preplaced into the selected anatomic<br>
location. Percutaneous placement of the hypodermic needle may be<br>
accomplished using manual palpation of known anatomic landmarks, with or<br>
without the use of fluoroscopy for visualize placement. Fluoroscopy may also<br>
be used in conjunction with surgical implantation prior to and/or concurrent<br>
with placement of the hypodermic needle.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, a guide wire (commonly referred to as a<br>
"k-wire") is first inserted percutaneously into the desired anatomic location to<br>
serve as a guide for the hypodermic needle. The hypodermic needle is<br>
inserted over the guide wire, which is subsequently removed leaving only the<br>
hypodermic needle in place. The solid rod-shaped composition is then<br>
inserted into the hub end of the hypodermic needle. Following loading of the<br>
composition, a second guide wire is inserted into the needle, which is used to<br>
advance the solid composition to the tip of the needle. The needle is then<br>
removed leaving the guide wire to anchor the composition within the bone at<br>
the desired location. Finally, the guide wire is removed leaving the solid<br>
composition in place. In another embodiment, the solid rod-shaped<br>
composition of the invention is preplaced within the needle barrel. After<br>
placement into the desired anatomic site, the plunger of the syringe is<br>
advanced into the needle barrel as the device is withdrawn, leaving the solid<br>
rod-shaped composition at the desired location.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, bone morphogenetic<br>
proteins are used as an osteoinductive agent to treat osteoporosis. Patients<br>
who might benefit from such treatment may be identified using any one or<br>
more of a variety of standard procedures, including measurement of bone<br>
mass/density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), quantitative<br>
computed tomography (QCT), single-photon absorptiometry, ultrasound<br>
transmission velocity (UTV), and/or radiographic assessment. Such<br>
procedures provide the clinician with information on the location and severity<br>
of osteoporotic or osteopenic bone lesions. In addition to locating the<br>
lesion(s) to be treated, the clinician can use this information to select the<br>
appropriate mode of administration and dose of osteoinductive agent for the<br>
patient.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, bone morphogenetic<br>
proteins are used as an osteoinductive agent in the process known as<br>
distraction osteogenesis. This process is an alternative to segmental bone<br>
regeneration in response to implanted osteoinductive agents. In traditional<br>
segmental bone repair, the osteoinductive agent and carrier are placed in the<br>
defect created between the parent bone ends. For bone formation to occur,<br>
the osteoinductive agent has to have sufficient residence time in the defect to<br>
stimulate differentiation of sufficient numbers of bone forming cells to support<br>
new bone formation. The process of distraction osteogenesis creates a<br>
regenerate construct between the distracted parent bone ends that is highly<br>
vascular and contains a large population of mesenchymal stem cells destined<br>
to become bone forming cells. As a result, the regenerate construct<br>
represents a much more ideal environment for cell differentiation growth<br>
factors such rhBMP-2 to stimulate rapid bone induction relative to induction of<br>
bone within a segmental defect.<br>
The process of distraction osteogenesis begins with an initial latency<br>
period allowing a fibrous connection to form between the bone ends to be<br>
distracted. Following this latency period, the bone ends are slowly distracted<br>
at a controlled rate of up to 1 mm per day in human clinical cases. Once the<br>
regenerate forms and the bone ends are distracted to the appropriate length,<br>
a prolonged consolidation period is required to allow the regenerate to form<br>
bone. This prolonged consolidation period which can be on the order 4 to 6<br>
months is associated with considerable morbidity. A frequent complication is<br>
the occurrence of pin track infections resulting from the extended length of<br>
time the external fixator used to generate the distraction must remain in place.<br>
In addition, there are considerable psychological effects and life style<br>
alterations associated with wearing the external fixator for prolonged periods<br>
of time. In addition to complications associated with the external fixator, there<br>
are a number of patients where the regenerate does not form properly and a<br>
delayed union or non-union occurs. Since the regenerate contains a<br>
responsive cell population and is already highly vascularized following the<br>
initial distraction phase, the use of bone morphogenetic proteins may rapidly<br>
accelerate the rate of bone formation during the normally prolonged<br>
consolidation phase of distraction osteogenesis. Acceleration of the<br>
distraction phase is limited by stretching of the soft tissues associated with<br>
bone. The cells created using distraction osteogenesis may also be<br>
harvested in order to provide a source of cells that are primed for<br>
osteogenesis. These cells can be cultured to prepare immortalized cell lines.<br>
If desired, these cells can also be immunotolerized using agents such as<br>
CTLA4 receptors [U.S. Patent 5,434,131] or CTLA4 ligands or B7 monoclonal<br>
antibodies [WO 96/40915]. Methods and materials for such<br>
immunotolerization are disclosed in the above references, and include co-<br>
transfection or treatment with these factors. The disclosure of these<br>
references is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In addition to treating osteoporosis and closed fractures, the rod-<br>
shaped compositions of the present invention may also find application to<br>
other bone sites such as bone cysts and defects. Injectable solid<br>
compositions may also be administered to non-bone sites, for example into<br>
tendons, damaged cartilage tissue, ligaments, and/or their attachment sites to<br>
bones.<br>
Although the foregoing discussion relates to the administration of a<br>
single osteoinductive composition, the present invention expressly<br>
contemplates the co-administration of multiple active ingredients in separate<br>
formulations, for example the bisphosphonate compositions described above.<br>
Multiple active ingredients may be delivered concurrently or sequentially in<br>
separate delivery vehicles, and individually or in combination.<br>
The dosage regimen will be determined by the clinical indication being<br>
addressed, as well as by various patient variables (e.g. weight, age, sex) and<br>
clinical presentation (e.g. extent of injury, site of injury, etc.).<br>
The compositions of the subject invention allow therapeutically effective<br>
amounts of osteoinductive protein to be delivered to an injury site where<br>
-cartilage and/or bone formation is desired. The formulations may be used as<br>
a substitute for autologous bone graft in fresh and non-union fractures, spinal<br>
fusions, and bone defect repair in the orthopaedic field; in cranio/maxillofacial<br>
reconstructions; in osteomyelitis for bone regeneration; and in the dental field<br>
for augmentation of the alveolar ridge and periodontal defects and tooth<br>
extraction sockets. When used to treat osteomyelitis or for bone repair with<br>
minimal infection, the osteogenic protein may be used in combination with<br>
antibiotics. The antibiotic is selected for its ability to decrease infection while<br>
having minimal adverse effects on bone formation. Preferred antibiotics for<br>
use in the compositions of the present invention include vancomycin and<br>
gentamycin. The antibiotic may be in any pharmaceutically acceptable form,<br>
such as vancomycin HCI or gentamycin sulfate. The antibiotic is preferably<br>
present in a concentration of from about 0.1 mg/mL to about 10.0 mg/mL.<br>
The traditional preparation of formulations in pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
form (i.e. pyrogen free, appropriate pH and isotonicity, sterility, etc.) is well<br>
within the skill in the art and is applicable to the formulations of the invention.<br>
The solid rod-shaped compositions of the present invention may also<br>
be utilized in combination with other drugs, growth factors, peptides, proteins,<br>
cytokines, oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, DNA and polymers.<br>
These compounds may be added by mixing them with the hyaluronic acid<br>
carrier or by covalent attachment to the carriers. The hyaluronic acid<br>
compositions may also be used with DNA encoding for BMPs and cells<br>
transduced or transfected with genes encoding BMP proteins.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are<br>
not limiting in any manner. Modifications, variations and minor enhancements<br>
are contemplated and are within the present invention.<br>
Example 1: Formulation of Hvaff-11 Rods<br>
Injectable 100% esterified Hyaff-11 rod-shaped compositions (1 mm in<br>
diameter) were prepared and evaluated for recombinant human bone<br>
morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) retention and bone formation efficacy.<br>
The rod-shaped compositions comprised Hyaff-11® hyaluronan-based<br>
material as carrier, two doses (see Table 1) of rhBMP-2 as active ingredient,<br>
and varying amounts of excipients for modulation of release kinetics.<br>
Excipients used in this example consisted of dry powder forms of either<br>
glutamic acid or buffer salts. Buffer salts contained 0.5% sucrose, 2.5%<br>
glycine, 5 mM L-glutamic acid, 5 mM NaCI, and 0.01% polysorbate 80. The<br>
Hyaff-11® based compositions were formed into rod shapes using a phase<br>
inversion process. Briefly, rhBMP-2 and excipients (glutamate and buffer<br>
salts) were mixed into pre-solubilized Hyaff-11® particulates (10% w/v) in<br>
organic solvent N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), extruded into excess ethanol<br>
(nonsolvent) using a syringe and a catheter (e.g., 16-gauge), phase inverted<br>
for 1 hour, rinsed, and dried. The drying step consisted of 24 hour air-drying<br>
followed by a 24 hour lyophilization step. Extrusion was performed using a<br>
metered syringe pump, preferably at 0.2 mL/min injection rate. The following<br>
Hyaff-11®-based compositions were prepared: Hyaff-11®, 20% (w/w) rhBMP-<br>
2, and 40% (w/w) glutamate (i.e., 40/40/20 (w/w) Hyaff-11®/glutamate/rhBMP-<br>
2); Hyaff-11®, 60% (w/w) rhBMP-2/buffer salts (i.e., 40/60 (w/w) Hyaff-<br>
11®/rhBMP-2); and Hyaff-11®, 20% (w/w) rhBMP-2, and 20% (w/w) buffer<br>
salts (i.e., 60/20/20 (w/w) Hyaff-11®/buffer salts/rhBMP-2). High rhBMP-2<br>
doses were obtained by desalting the protein formulation prior to combination<br>
with the Hyaff-11. Dried rods were typically cut into 1 or 2 cm segments for<br>
further evaluation. The theoretical doses of the rods are listed in Table 1.<br>
The preferred mode of administration is a 16-gauge hypodermic needle<br>
equipped with an obdurator to inject the solid rods into the intraosseous site.<br>
Example 2: Formulation of Hyaff-11 p65® Rods<br>
Injectable 65% esterified Hyaff-11p65 rod-shaped compositions (1 mm<br>
in diameter) were prepared and evaluated for rhBMP-2 retention and bone<br>
formation efficacy. The rod-shaped compositions comprised Hyaff-11p65®<br>
hyaluronan-based material as carrier and two doses (see Table 1) of rhBMP-2<br>
as active ingredient. Hyaff-11 p65®-based compositions comprising 20%<br>
(w/w) rhBMP-2 (i.e., 80/20 (w/w) Hyaff-11p65®/rhBMP-2) or 40% (w/w)<br>
rhBMP-2 (i.e., 60/40 (w/w) Hyaff-11p65®/rhBMP-2) were prepared by mixing<br>
desalted rhBMP-2 and Hyaff-11p65® non-woven pads in dry forms, followed<br>
by hydrating to 18.75% (w/v) of the weight of the non-woven pad, mixing to a<br>
white paste-like consistency, transferring to a syringe, extruding through a<br>
catheter (e.g., 16-gauge), and drying. A variation of this method consists of<br>
extruding the paste through a catheter to a rod form, freezing the rod (in -80°C<br>
or liquid nitrogen), inserting into a slightly larger diameter tubing (e.g., 14-<br>
gauge catheter), and drying. The drying step consisted of 24-hour air-drying<br>
followed by a 24-hour lyophilization step. Alternative methods of rod<br>
preparation include molding the Hyaff-11 p65® paste into a 1.5 mm inner-<br>
diameter silastic or Teflon®/FeP tubing followed by drying. The preferred<br>
mode of administration is a 16-gauge hypodermic needle equipped with an<br>
obdurator to force the solid rods into the intraosseous site.<br>
Example 3: In Vitro Characterization<br>
All rod-shaped compositions were rigid, straight, handleable, and<br>
injectable through a 16-gauge needle. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM)<br>
of Hyaff-11® rod compositions were typically solid, dense, and smooth, while<br>
those of Hyaff-11 p65® rod compositions were densely packed with short,<br>
fibrillar segments of the native non-woven fibers. Bioactivity of rhBMP-2 in the<br>
rod-shaped compositions was obtained after extracting rhBMP-2 from the<br>
compositions and testing its ability to induce alkaline phosphatase (a bone<br>
marker) expression in mouse W-20-17 stromal cells. The rhBMP-2 from<br>
Hyaff-11® and Hyaff-11p65® rod compositions were bioactive.<br>
Example 4: In Vivo Local Biodistribution<br>
A range of in vivo rhBMP-2 retention profiles were obtained using<br>
Hyaff-11® and Hyaff-11 p65® rod compositions. Local retention times of<br>
rhBMP-2 in 1 cm rod-shaped compositions (prepared as described in<br>
Example 1 and 2) were evaluated in a rabbit distal femur intraosseous model<br>
using 125l-rhBMP-2 and gamma scintigraphy (Figure 1). Formulations<br>
comprising Hyaff-11® (not Hyaff-11p65®) provided slow, sustained release of<br>
rhBMP-2, regardless of BMP-2 dose or excipients. Sterilization of the<br>
glutamate excipient by ethylene oxide provided a slightly more burst release<br>
during the initial 3-day period as compared to gamma-sterilized glutamate.<br>
The 80/20 (w/w) Hyaff-11p65®/rhBMP-2 composition provided the fastest<br>
release kinetics of rhBMP-2.<br>
Example 5: Efficacy and Biocompatibilitv<br>
The Hyaff-11 ©-based compositions (not Hyaff-11 p65®), prepared as<br>
described above, were evaluated for biocompatibility and effect on bone<br>
formation two weeks following subcutaneous (ventral thorax) and<br>
intraosseous (distal femur) administration in rats. The rod-shaped<br>
compositions were 2 mm and 10 mm in length for intraosseous and<br>
subcutaneous administration, respectively. Radiographic and histologic<br>
analysis of subcutaneous sites of administration showed bone formation<br>
adjacent to the rod-shaped compositions containing rhBMP-2, suggesting that<br>
rhBMP-2/Hyaff-11® rods were osteoinductive (data not shown). Both<br>
subcutaneous and intraosseous sites of administration showed minimum<br>
inflammatory responses, suggesting good biocompatibility of the hyaluronic<br>
acid/BMP-2 compositions. The Hyaff-11® and Hyaff-11 p65® rod<br>
compositions were additionally injected into rabbit distal femurs and after 7<br>
weeks, considerable de novo bone formation in the intraosseous space was<br>
observed by histology (data not shown) and particularly in the 80/20 (w/w)<br>
Hyaff-11 p65®/rhBMP-2 and 40/40/20 (w/w) Hyaff-11-®/g!utamate/rhBMP-2<br>
formulations. Injection of 80/20 (w/w) Hyaff-11 p65®/rhBMP-2 rod formulation<br>
into the distal radius of ovariectomized baboons resulted in a 30 % relative<br>
increase in trabecular bone volume compared to untreated controls<br>
histologically (data not shown).<br>
