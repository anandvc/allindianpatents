				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of flavoured dry roasted nuts or fried nut formulation. The present invention particularly relates to application of oleoresin on roasted or fried nuts thereby providing uniform coating of the oleoresin on the nuts and retaining the flavor of the nuts.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Major limitations of flavoring of nuts such as deep fat fried/dry roasted cashew nuts/peanuts with powdered spices are: (1) presence of thermo resistant bacterial load, which creates safety problems during storage. (2) Non-uniformity of the flavor quality (3) reduced impact of natural spice flavor, and (4) rapid loss of aroma during storage and presence of intense colored spots randomly distributed throughout the surface of the nut. In order to sustain a continuous demand for spiced nuts it is necessary to develop alternate flavorings as well as well as methods of application. The problems encountered by using powdered spices can be overcome to a large extent by developing suitable method of using spice oleoresins to flavor the processed nuts. By definition, the oleoresin is the total soluble extractives of a material in a specified solvent. In flavor work the best oleoresin is that which is a concentrate of all the flavor components (aroma, taste, pungency, and related sensory factors) and which truly recreates, when diluted, the sensory quality of the original natural material. Oleoresins do not have many of the disadvantages inherent in the use of powdered spices in terms of flavored quality, uniformity, and separation of storage. At the same time oleoresin offer convenience, while using in food industry or large-scale preparation. The work reported in this patent gives a detailed account of use of oleoresins for flavoring of deep fat fried/dry roasted cashew nuts.<br>
Reference may be made to 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,865, in which an adhesive for adhering flavoring which is a mixture of a reducing sugar preferable lactose and a maltodextrin. The adhesive is particularly useful for coating peanuts with a dry honey coating providing honey coated and salted nuts. In the present method adhesives are not used.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US patent no 4,931,304, 1990, describing a process for<br>
flavoring edible nuts which comprises roasting of nuts, partially cooling the nuts to<br>
about 56°C to 92°C, applying a volatile flavoring agent and blending the nuts until the<br>
flavor agent is absorbed by the nuts. This patent refers to only volatile flavorings<br>
where as oleoresins contain non-volatiles also.<br>
Reference may be made to 1993 US patent 5,194,278, which relates to edible cores,<br>
especially nuts (peanuts, cashews etc) having a desirable fruit flavoring. More<br>
particularly the invention relates to edible cores which are prepared by coating with<br>
an adhesive solution containing a source of fruit flavoring and then roasting, to<br>
provide a snack having desired toasted taste and appearance and a fruit flavoring<br>
the present invention does not make use of adhesive solutions.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 5,061,499, which describes the coating the<br>
raw nuts (peanuts, cashews etc) with an adhesive solution containing honey, corn<br>
syrup, sucrose, carbohydrate gum and water followed by a coating of powdered<br>
sugar, roasting the nuts preferably in oil, and then applying a coating of a dry mixture<br>
of sugar and salt. The final coating is tightly adherent after roasting. Present<br>
invention relates to a single stage coating without using adhesive.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 5,939,119, which describes a process for<br>
coating nuts by immersing the nuts in a molten edible material to coat the nuts with<br>
molten edible material, separating the excess molten edible material and then<br>
cooling the coated nuts to solidify the molten edible materials. The present invention<br>
does not involve coating by immersion.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 5,093,139, relating the to a method of<br>
preparing roasted sunflower shells containing seeds having a generally uniform<br>
coating of a flavoring agent. A liquid flavor containing a coating solution is used in<br>
the form of a spray. The present invention does not use a coating solution.<br>
Reference may be made to 1987 US patent 4,692,342, describing a process for<br>
honey-roasting nuts by applying a predusting of a minor amount of an adhesive, filmforming<br>
material, honey and water; enrobing the adhesive coated nuts with a dry<br>
mixture of honey sugar and salt; and subjecting the coated nuts to roasting,<br>
preferably air roasting. Present process does not use any dusting material or film<br>
forming material.<br>
Reference may be made 1979 US patent no 4,161,545, which describes the coating<br>
nuts with the combination of honey and water followed by enrobing with a dry<br>
mixture of sugar and starch and the nuts are then roasted. The present process<br>
does not relate to use of honey or sugar or starch.<br>
Reference may be made to 1987 US patent no 4,692,342, that describes the storage<br>
stability of prepared peanuts/cashew nuts by applying a pre-dusting of minor amount<br>
of an adhesive and coating material and the product was air roasted. But the<br>
present process does not contain any pre-dusting material or any coating material<br>
and here the product is not air roasted it is deep fat fried and flavored.<br>
Reference may be made to 1988 US patent 4,769,248, relates to the a process for<br>
preparing dry roasting nuts, comprising applying a uniform coating of a starch to raw<br>
nuts, applying, a uniform coating of a gelatin solution to the starch coated nuts by<br>
applying a coating of a seasoning mix to the coated nuts, and roasting the resulting<br>
nuts. But in this present invention the nuts are not roasted after flavor addition.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
roasted and oleoresin flavored nut, which obviates from the drawbacks listed above.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide roasted and uniformly oleoresin<br>
flavored nuts.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
roasted and uniformly oleoresin flavored nuts.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process with a liquid<br>
coating, which strongly adheres to the surface of the nuts.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process that does not use any separate binding agent in order to improve or maintain the flavor and aroma of the roasted or deep fried nuts<br>

salt is sprayed using the powder sprayer. Diluted pepper oleoresin is sprayed over<br>
the cashew kernels tumbling in the drum and mixed thoroughly for another<br>
Sminutes. Cashew kernels are then dried in a tray drier at 55°C for 40minut.es and<br>

and allowed to cool under ambient condition (26-27°C and 40-45%RH) for 25<br>
minutes.<br>
Advantages<br>
1. Instead of powdered spices, oleoresins are used resulting in uniform coating.<br>
2. Diluted oleoresin when applied to the kernel does not require any binding agent<br>
whereas while adding powdered spices binding agent is needed for better<br>
adhesion.<br>
3. Since the flavoring is in the liquid form, the problem of separation of flavoring<br>
during handling and storage is totally avoided.<br>
4. Spice oleoresin coated as a thin film all over the kernel gives uniform color to the<br>
surface.<br>
5. In the case of fried kernels the coating of oleoresin offers protection to the<br>
surface oil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
