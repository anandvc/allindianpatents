COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"POLYCARBONATE   COMPOSITION  AND   A   METHOD   OF   PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
BAYER    AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,     a    German     company,     of    D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   invention   and   the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
The  present  invention  relates to  polycarbonate  composition  and  a method  of preparation thereof<br>
It is known to add talc as a reinforcing substance to polycarbonate compositions in order to increase the rigidity and tensile strength, to increase the dimensional stability during variations in temperature and to improve the surface properties. The talc added also serves as a flameproofing synergist in flame-resistant matenals.<br>
WO 98/51737 AT discloses ablend of polycarbonate and copolymer of acrylonitrile and styrene (hereinafter referred to as PC/SAN) which have polystyrene-grafted polybutadiene rubber as an impact modifier and comprise mineral fillers, e. g. talc, with an average particle size of preferably 1.5 to 5 pm. The moulding compositions described are not given a flame-resistant treatment. It furthermore emerges from the examples that moulding compositions which comprise talc with a particle size of 
US-A   5   162   419   describes ablend   of  polycarbonate   and   copolymer   of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (hereinafter referred to as  PC/ABS) moulding compositions which comprise talc with an average particle size of 1.5 to 20 p.m, preferably 4.0 to lOpm, to improve the surface appearance of injection-moulded finished components. The moulding compositions described are distinguished by a matt surface and improved mechanical properties. JP-A 11/199768 discloses flame-resistant PC/ABS compositions comprising talc and phosphoric acid esters, 90 wt.% of the talc having a particle size of 
2<br><br>
To.A 25 359 Foreign<br>
US-A 5 091 461 discloses PC/ABS compositions which comprise as the reinforcing substance talc and non-calcined clay minerals. The talc types used have a particle size of less than 44 urn (= 44,000 nm). The PC'ABS compositions are distinguished by a reduced linear thermal expansion coefficient and a relatively high impact strength at low temperatures.<br>
EP-A 0 758 003 A2 describes PC moulding compositions which can comprise inorganic fillers with a particle diameter of &gt; 0.5 mm as the reinforcing substance. Talc with a particle diameter of &gt; 0.2 mm is mentioned, inter alia as a filler. The PC moulding compositions can furthermore be given a flame-resistant treatment and are distinguished by an improved surface appearance and a high modulus of elasticity. Polycarbonate blends are not described in this specification.<br>
A disadvantage of the talc-containing PC/ABS blends known from the prior art is that an increase in the E modulus is indeed achieved by the addition of talc, but at the same time other mechanical properties, such as elongation at break and toughness, are impaired. The addition of talc to PC/ABS blends as a rule leads to a significant deterioration in the toughness of the shaped article produced from the composition. Either the toughness achieved by addition of talc is often therefore not sufficient for specific uses, or the amount of the inorganic material employed is too low to realize the property advantages intended from its addition to a sufficient extent.<br>
In addition, the weld strength in known talc-containing PC/ABS blends is often inadequate.<br>
It is thus desirable to provide polycarbonate compositions to which talc is added in a known manner for the purpose of improving at least one material property, but which are distinguished by an improved level of toughness and/or toughness at low temperatures compared with the prior art and an increased weld strength. In particular, the polycarbonate compositions should be distinguished by an improved<br>
.   <br><br><br>
toughness at low temperatures with simultaneously good values for the elongation at break and E modulus.<br>
The polycarbonate compositions according to the invention should furthermore have<br>
5	good processing properties, i.e. a high melt flow rate.<br>
This object is achieved by a polycarbonate composition which comprises<br>
(A)	at least one aromatic polycarbonate and/or polyester-carbonate,<br>
(B)	at least one graft polymer of 5 to 95 wt.% of a mixture of 50 to 99 parts by wt, of vmylaromatics and/or vinylaromatics substituted on the nucleus and/or methacrylic acid (Ci-Cs)-alkyl esters and 1 to 50 parts by wt. of vinyl cyanides and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters and/or derivatives of unsaturated carboxylic acids, on 95 to 5 wt.% of at least one graft base with a glass transition temperature of below about 10°C and<br>
(C)       at least one talc with an average particle diameter of less than 1,000 nm.<br>
The invention furthermore provides shaped articles consisting of these compositions or comprising them.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that by addition of specific talc types with an average<br>
particle diameter of less than about  1,000 nm to PC/ABS blends, a significant<br>
	improvement in weld strength, elongation at break and toughness compared with<br>
comparable moulding compositions with conventional talc types can be achieved, while retaining the E modulus and the melt flow properties.<br>
The polycarbonate or polyester-carbonate compositions according to the invention can comprise further polymeric constituents and conventional additives, in addition to the graft polymers described. Further possible polymeric constituents are, for example,   graft  polymers   of a  vinyl   monomer  on  one   or  more   sraft  bases.<br>
4<br><br>
thermoplastic vinyl (co)polymers, polyalkylene terephthalares. polyamides and further thermoplastic resins. Possible polymer additives are mould release agents, stabilizers, antioxidants, flameproofmg agents, dyestuffs and pigments, antistatics, nucleating agents, anti-drippmg agents and organic and further inorganic fillers and reinforcing substances.<br>

Component A<br>
Aromatic polycarbonates and/or aromatic polyester-carbonates according to component A which are suitable according to the invention are known from the literature or can be prepared by processes known from the literature (for the preparation of aromatic polycarbonates see, for example, Schnell.

Investigation of the properties of the moulding compositions according to the invention<br>
The notched impact strength ak and the impact strength an are determined in accordance with ISO 180/1 A or ISO 180/1 U. To determine the temperature of the tough/brittle transition, the notched impact strengths ak are measured at various temperatures and evaluated. For this, starting from room temperature the test temperature is lowered in steps of 5° until a brittle fracture is observed.<br>
To determine the weld strength, the impact strength at the weld seam of test specimens injection-moulded from both sides (processing temperature: 240/260°C) of dimensions 170 x 10 x 4 mm is measured in accordance with ISO 179/1 eU.<br><br>
The E modulus and the elongation at break were determined in the tensile test according to ISO 527.<br>
The burning properties of the flame-resistant specimens were measured in accordance with UL-Subj. 94 V on bars of dimensions 127 x 12.7 x 1.2 mm, which were produced on an injection moulding machine at 260°C.<br>
