				<td>FEEDBACK AND RATE ADAPTATION FOR MIMO<br>
TRANSMISSION IN A TIME DIVISION DUPLEXED (TDD)<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to provisional U.S. Application Serial No. 60/955,622, entitled "METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR FEEDBACK MECHANISM AND RATE ADAPTATION FOR TIME DIVISION DUPLEX (TDD) MIMO SYSTEMS," filed August 13, 2007, assigned to the assignee hereof and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more<br>
specifically to techniques for transmitting and receiving data in a wireless<br>
communication system.	-<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003] In a wireless communication system, a transmitter may utilize multiple (T) transmit anteimas for data transmission to a receiver equipped with multiple (R) receive antennas. The multiple transmit and receive anteimas form a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel that may be used to increase throughput and/or improve reliability. For example, the transmitter may transmit up to T symbol streams simultaneously from the T transmit antennas to improve throughput. Alternatively, the transmitter may transmit a single symbol stream from all T transmit anteimas to improve reception by the receiver.<br>
[0004] To achieve good performance, the receiver may estimate the MIMO channel response and determine a precoding matrix to use for a MIMO transmission. The receiver may also determine a channel quality indicator (CQI) or a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for each symbol stream sent m the MIMO transmission. The receiver may send feedback information to the transmitter. This feedback information may include the precoding matrix as well as the CQI or MCS for each symbol stream. The feedback information is usefiil to the transmitter but represents oveibead.   It is<br>
 <br>
desirable to reduce the amount of feedback information to send for the MIMO transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Techniques for sending a MIMO transmission with less feedback overhead in a wireless communication system are described herein. In an aspect, feedback overhead may be reduced by having both a transmitter and a receiver determine a precoding matrix to use for a MIMO transmission. This may be achieved by exploiting chamiel reciprocity due to time division duplexing in the system. [0006] In one design, a transmitter may send a first reference signal or pilot to a receiver. The receiver may select a precoding matrix based on the first reference signal and in accordance with a selection criterion. In one design, the receiver may obtain a MIMO chamiel matrix based on the first reference signal and may obtain a beamforming matrix based on (e.g., by performing singular value decomposition of) the MIMO channel matrix. The receiver may then select the precoding matrix firom a cddebook of precoding matrices based on the beamfomung matrix and in accordance with the selection criterion, e.g., the closest distance between the beamforming matrix and the precoding matrix. The receiver may estimate noise and interference at the receiver. The receiver may determine the number of symbol streams (S) to send and CQI or MCS information for the S symbol streams based on the precoding matrix, the estimated noise and interference, and possibly other information. The receiver may send the CQI or MCS information and a second reference signal or pilot to the transmitter.<br>
[0007] The transmitter may select the precoding matrix based on the second reference signal and in accordance with the same selection criterion used by the receiver. The transmitter may then send a MIMO transmission to the receiver based on the CQI or MCS information obtained fi-om the receiver and the precoding matrix selected by the transmitter. The transmitter may encode and modulate S symbol streams in accordance with the CQI or MCS information and may perform precoding for these symbol streams based on the precoding matrix.<br>
[0008] The techniques described herein may be used for MIMO transmission on the downlink as well as the uplink. Various aspects and features of the disclosure are described in further detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems. Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems. Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) systems, Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) systems, and other systems. The terms "system" and "network" are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) and other variants of CDMA. cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM®, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is an upcoming release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlmk and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents firom an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP). cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2). For clarity, certain aspects of the techniqiws are described below for data transmissiiMi m LTE, and LTE tenninol
 <br>
[0018] FIG. 1 shows a wireless communication system 100, which may be an LTE system. System 100 may include a number of Node Bs 110 and other network entities. A Node B may be a fixed station that communicates with the UEs and may also be referred to as an evolved Node B (eNB), a base station, an access point, etc. Each Node B 110 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area. The overall coverage area of a Node B may be partitioned into multiple (e.g., three) smaller areas. Each smaller area may be served by a respective Node B subsystem. In 3GPP, the term "cell" can refer to the smallest coverage area of a Node B and/or a Node B subsystem serving this coverage area.<br>
[0019] UEs 120 may be dispersed throughout the system, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as a mobile station, a terminal, an access terminal, a subscriber unit, a station, etc. A UE may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a l£top computer, a cordless phone, etc. A UE may communicate with a Node B via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the commimication link fi-om the Node B to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link fi:om the UE to the Node B.<br>
[0020] The system may utilize time division duplexing (TDD). For TDD, the downlink and uplink may share the same frequency channel, and a downlink channel response may be correlated with an uplink chaimel response.<br>
[0021] FIG. 2 shows an example frame structure 200 that may be used for TDD in LTE. The transmission timeline may be partitioned into units of radio frames. Each radio frame may have a predetermined duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)) and may be partitioned into 10 subframes with mdices of 0 through 9. LTE supports multiple downlink-uplink configurations. Subframes 0 and S may be used for the downlink (DL) and subframe 2 may be used for the uplmk (UL) for all downlink-uplink configurations. Subframes 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 may each be used for the downlink or uplink depending on the downlink-uplink configuration. Subfirame 1 may include three special fields composed of a Downlink Pilot Time Slot (DwPTS) used for downlink control channels as well as data transmissions, a Guard Period (GP) of no transmission, and an Uplink Pilot Time Slot (UpPTS) used for either a random access channel (RACH) or sounding reference signals (SRS). Subframe 6 may inclxide <mly the dwpts or all three special fields a downlink subframe depending on downlmk-uplink configufotion.></mly>
 <br>
DwPTS, GP and UpPTS may have different durations for different subframe configurations.<br>
[0022] Each subframe that is not used for the special fields may be partitioned into two slots. Each slot may include L symbol periods, e.g., L = 6 symbol p«iods for an extended cyclic prefix or L = 7 symbol periods for a normal cyclic prefix. Frame structure 200 is described in 3GPP TS 36.211, entitled "Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical Channels and Modulation," which is publicly available.<br>
[0023] LTE utilizes orthogonal fi«quency division multiplexmg (OFDM) on the downlink and single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) on the uplink. OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as tones, bins, etc. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the fiquency domain with OFDM and in the time domam with SC-FDM. The spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers (K) may be dependent on the system bandwidth. For example, K may be equal to 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 for system bandwidtii of 1.25,2.5,5,10 or 20 MHz, respectively. [0024] The K total subcarrio may be grouped into resource blocks. Each resource block may include N subcarriers (e.g., N = 12 subcarriers) in one slot. The available resource blocks may be assigned to the UEs for transmission of data and control information. The K total subcarriers may also be partitioned into subbands. Each subband may include 72 subcarriers in 6 resource blocks covering 1.08 MHz. [0025] A Node B may periodically transmit a downlink reference signal, which may be a cell-specific reference signal for all UEs within a cell of the Node B or a UE-specific reference signal for a specific UE. A UE may be configured to periodically transmit a sounding reference signal to the Node B. A reference signal is a signal that is known a priori by both a transmitter and a receiver. A reference signal may also be referred to as pilot, preamble, sounding, training, etc. A Node B may transmit a downlink reference signal across all or part of the system bandwidth. A UE may use the downlink reference signal for channel estimation to estimate the downlink channel response and downlink channel quality for the Node B. The UE may transmit a sounding reference signal on a subband in a subframe. The UE may cycle through all subbands and transmit the sounding reference signal on different subbands m different<br>
 <br>
subframes. The Node B may use the sounding reference signal for channel estimation to estimate the uplink channel response and uplink channel quality for the UE. The downlink reference signal and the sounding reference signal may be generated and transmitted as described in the aforementioned 3GPP TS 36.211. Other reference signals and pilots may also be transmitted on the downlink and uplink to support channel estimation.<br>
[0026] A transmitter may send a MIMO transmission to a receiver. The receiver may estimate the MIMO channel response and determine a precoding matrix to use for the MIMO transmission. The receiver may also perform rank selection and determine the rank or number of symbol streams (S) to send for the MIMO transmission, where 1  S  min {T, R}, T is the niunber of antemias at the transmitter, and R is the number of antennas at the receiver. The receiver may also perform rate selection and determine a CQI or an MCS for each symbol stream. CQI and MCS may provide equivalent information and may be used to select a coding scheme or code rate as well as a modulation scheme for a symbol stream to achieve a desired reliability, e.g., a target packet error rate (PER). The receiver may send feedback information comprising the precoding matrix and a CQI/MCS value for each symbol stream. The rank may be implicitly provided by the dimension of the precoding matrix or by the number of CQI/MCS values sent by the receiver. The transmitter may process (e.g., encode and modulate) each symbol stream m accordance with the CQI/MCS value for that symbol stream. The transmitter may fiirther perform precoding for aU S symbol streams based on the precoding matrix and may then send a MIMO transmission comprising the S preceded symbol streams to the receiver. Feedback overhead may be high to send both the precoding matrix and the CQI/MCS value for each symbol stream. [0027] In an aspect, feedback overhead for a MIMO transmission in a TDD system may be reduced by having both the transmitter and receiver determine the precoding matrix to use for the MIMO transmission. This may be achieved by exploiting reciprocity of the MIMO channel in the TDD system, as described below. Tie receiver may determine the CQI/MCS value for each symbol stream based on the selected precoding matrix and the noise and interference estimated by the receiver. ITie receiver may send feedback information comprising only a CQI/MCS value for each symbol stream. Feedback overhead may be reduced by not sending the precodmg matrix.<br>
 <br>
[0028] FIG. 3 shows a design of processing for a MIMO transmission from a transmitter 310 to a receiver 320 with reduced feedback overhead. For MIMO transmission on the downlink, transmitter 310 may be a Node B and receiver 320 may be a UE. For MIMO transmission on the uplink, transmitter 310 may be a UE and receiver 320 may be a Node B. The MIMO transmission may be sent on multiple subcarriers, and the processing at transmitter 310 and receiver 320 may be repeated for each subcarrier. For simplicity, much of the description below is for one subcarrier. [0029] Transmitter 310 may send a first reference signal via all T antennas at the transmitter (step 1). The first reference signal may be a downlink reference signal if transmitter 310 is a Node B or a sounding reference signal if transmitter 310 is a UE. Receiver 320 may receive the first reference signal via all R antennas at tiie receiver. Receiver 320 may estimate the response of the MIMO chaimel from transmitter 310 to receiver 320 based on the first reference signal (step 2). Receiver 320 may obtain an R X T MIMO channel matrix H, which may be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
transmitter 310 and antenna i at receiver 320.<br>
[0030]      Transmitter 310 may transmit data on multiple subcarriers in xme or more<br>
resource blocks. Receiver 320 may obtain a MIMO channel matrix for each subcarrier<br>
of interest, e.g., each subcarrier usable for data transmission. Receiver 320 may also<br>
estimate the noise and interference at the receiver (e.g., for each resource block usable<br>
for daKsi transmission) based on the first reference signal a]»l/or other received symbols<br>
(step 3).<br>
[0031]      Receiver 320 may select a precodmg matrix W based on the MJMO channel<br>
matrix H and in accordance with a selection criterion (step 4). In one design, receiver<br>
320 may diagonalize the MIMO channel matrix with singular value decomposition, as<br>
follows:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0032] A unitary matrix has columns that are orthogonal to one another, and each column has unit power. A diagonal matrix has possible non-zero values along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Matrix V may also be referred to as a beamforming matrix. Receiver 320 may also obtain the beamforming matrix V by performing eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix of H. The eigenvalue decomposition<br>
 <br>
[0033] Transmitter 310 may perform precoding with the beamforming matrix V in order to transmit data on the eigenmodes of H. The eigenmodes may be viewed as orthogonal spatial channels. The singular values in £ are indicative of the cluinnel gains of the eigerraiodes of H. The number of eigenmodes (M) may be given as M  min {T, R}. Transmitter 310 may transmit up to M symbol streams on up to M eigenmodes using up to M columns of the beamforming matrix V. Good poformance may be achieved by transmitting data on the eigenmodes of H. [0034] A set of precoding matrices may be supported and may be referred to as a codebook. In one design, a precoding matrix in the codebook that is closest to the beamforming matrix V may be selected. A distance metric may be computed for each precoding matrix in the cookbook, as follows:<br>
 <br>
i-th row andy-th column of matrix V, Wj is the (/,y) -th element of the -th precoding matrix in the cookbook, and<br>
£)
[0035] The design in equation (3) assumes that receiver 320 obtained one MIMO channel matrix. Ifreceiv 320 obtained multiple MIMO channel matrices for multiple<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0036] The distance metric in equation (3) may be indicative of the distance between the beamforming matrix V and a preceding matrix in the cookbook. The distance metric may be computed for each preceding matrix in the coold)ook. The preceding matrix with the smallest distance metric among ail preceding matrices in the cookbook may be selected. The selected preceding matrix W may be the closest approximation of the beamforming matrix V.<br>
[0037] In the design described above, receiver 320 may select a preceding matrix based on the selection criterion of the selected preceding matrix being closest to the beamforming matrix among all preceding matrices in the cedebook. In another design, receiver 320 may select a preceding matrix based on the MMO channel matrix in accordance with a pseudo eigen-beamforming technique described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/317,413, entitled "PSEUDO EIGEN-BEAMFORMING WITH DYNAMIC BEAM SELECTION," filed December 22,2005. Receiver 320 may also select a preceding matrix based on some ether selection criterion.<br>
[0038] Receiver 320 may select a preceding matrix based solely on the MIMO channel matrix H, as described above. Receiver 320 may also select a preceding matrix based en ether information such as a noise covariance matrix.<br>
[0039] Receiver 320 may determine the number of symbol streams to send and a CQI/MCS value for each symbol stream based on the selected preceding matrix W, the MIMO channel matrix H, the estimated noise and interference, and the available transmit power (step S). Each symbol stream may be sent on one layer. Each layer may correspond to an eigenmede of H if the select preceding matrix W resembles the beamforming matrix V. Receiver 320 may hypothesize that transmitter 310 will transmit data using the selected precodmg matrix W. The received symbols at receiver 320 may then be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Hgff =HWG isanRxT effective MIMO channel observed by the data symbols, r is an R X1 vector of received symbols, and n is an R X1 vector of noise and interference.<br>
[0040]      The   noise   and   interference   may   have   a   covariance   matrix   of<br>
 <br>
be assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a zero mean vector and a covariance matrix of R = cr I, where er is the variance of the noise and interference. Receiver 320 may estimate the noise and interference based on the first reference signal and/or other received symbols. Receiver 320 may average the noise and interference measurements over a suitable time period to obtain the noise variance or the noise covariance matrix.<br>
[0041] Receiver 320 may perform MIMO detection based on minimum mean square error (MMSE), zero-forcmg, MMSE with successive mterference cancellation, or some other MIMO detection technique. For MMSE, receiver 320 may derive a TxR detection matrix M, as follows:<br>
 <br>
whore d is a T X1 vector of symbol estimates and is an estimate of data vector d sent by tnuismitter 310. If data is transmitted on multiple subcarriers, then receiver 320 may derive a detection matrix M() for each subcarrier k based on a MIMO clumnel matrix H(A:) for that subcarrier and the selected precoding matrix W. Receiver 320 may then perform MIMO detection for each subcarrier k based on the detection matrix M() for that subcarrier.<br>
[0043] Receiver 320 may determine a signal-to-and-noise-and-interfin'ence ratio (SINR) for each layer, as follows:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
where z, is the 5-th diagonal element of matrix Z and SINRj is the SINK of layer s. [0044] The SINR of each layer may be dependent on the MIMO detection technique used by receiver 320. Different MIMO detection techniques may be associated with different equations for computing SINR. If data is transmitted on multiple subcarriers, then receiver 320 may determine the SINR of each layer s for each subcarrier k based on matrix Zj(k) for that subcarrier.<br>
[0045] Receiver 320 may perform rank selection to select one or more layers to use for data transmission. Receiver 320 may evaluate each possible combination of layers that can be used for data transmission. For a given layer combination oit hypothesis, receiver 320 may allocate the available transmit power of Pwaii to the S layers in that combination based on uniform power allocation, so that P, =P,vui/S may be allocated<br>
to each layer. The power allocation may also be based on water-filling or some other technique. The available transmit power may be dependent on the differeoce between the transmit power for the downlink and the transmit power for the uplink. This power difference may be known or ascertainable by both transmitter 310 and receiver 320. The available transmit power may be given by a difference between the transmit power for data (which may be reflected in the gain matrix G) and the transmit power for the first reference signal (which may be reflected in the MIMO channel matrix H). In any case, receiver 320 may determine the gain matrix G based on the tralismit power allocated to the S layers. The gain matrix G may include a non-zero gJEun for each selected layer and a zero gain for each unselected layer. Receiver 3210 may then determine the effective MIMO channel matrix Heer based on the MIMO channel matrix H, the precoding matrix W, and the gain matrix G. Receiver 320 may determine the SINRs of the S layers based on the effective MIMO channel matrix Heff and the noise covariance matrix , as described above. Receiver 320 may compute a mlc such as overall throughput based on the SINRs of the S layers for the current hypothesis. [0046] Receiver 320 may repeat the computation described above for each possible combination of layers and may obtain an overall throughput for each combination. Receiver 320 may select the combination of layers with the highest overall throughput. Receiver 320 may convert the SINR of each layer in the selected combination to a CQI value baaed on a predetermined mapping.   Alternatively, receiver 320 may select an<br>
 <br>
MCS value for each layer based on the SINR of that layer using a predetermined mapping. Receiver 320 may obtain S CQI values or S MCS values for the S layers in the selected combination. These S CQI/MCS values may reflect both tiie selected precoding matrix W and the estimated noise and interference at receiver 320. Receiver 320 may send CQI/MCS information comprising the S CQI/MCS values for tiie S layers to transmitter 310 (step 6).<br>
[0047] Receiver 320 may also send a second reference signal via all R antennas at the reiver (step 7). The second reference signal may be a sounding reference signal if receiver 320 is a UE or a downlink reference signal if receiver 320 is a Node B. [0048] Transmitter 310 may receive the second reference signal via all T antennas at the transmitter. Transmitter 310 may estimate the response of the MIMO channel from receiver 320 to transmitter 310 based on the second reference signal (step 8). For a TDD system, the MIMO channel from receiver 320 to transmitter 310 may be assumed to be reciprocal of the MIMO channel from transmitter 310 to receiver 320. The MIMO channel matrix obtained by transmitter 310 may be given as H, y/hete " " denotes a transpose.<br>
[0049] An overall MIMO channel from transmitter 310 to receiver 320 may be composed of the transmit chains for the T antmnas at transmitter 310, the MIMO channel, and the receive chains for the R antennas at receiver 320. An overall MIMO channel from receiver 320 to transmitter 310 may be composed of the transmit chains for the R antennas at receiver 320, the MIMO channel, and the receive chains for the T antennas at transmitter 310. The responses of the transmit and receive chains at transmitter 310 may not match the responses of the transmit and receive chains at receiver 320. Calibration may be performed to determine a calibration matrix that may be applied (e.g., at transmitter 310) to account for the differences between the responses of the transmit and receive chains at transmitter 310 and receive: 320. Calibration may be poformed as described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Applicati(Hi Serial No. 10/693,169, entitled "CHANNEL CALIBRATION FOR A TIME DIVISION DUPLEXED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM," filed October 23, 2003. With the calibration matrix applied, the overall MIMO chomel from transmitter 310 to receiver 320 may be assumed to be reciprocal of the overall MIMO channel frt}m rwpeiver 320 to transmitter 310. For simplicity, the following description assumes that the transmit and receive chams have flat responses and that the calibration matrix is an idmtity matrix.<br>
 <br>
Transmitter 310 may use the transpose of the MIMO channel matrix H obtained by transmitter 310 as an estimate of the MIMO chaimel matrix H obtained by receiver 320. [0050] Transmitter 310 may select a precoding matrix W based on the MIMO channel matrix H obtained by transmitter 310 and in accordance with the same selection criterion used by receiver 320 (step 9). For the design described above, transmitter 310 may perform singular value decomposition of the MIMO channel matrix H to obtain the beamforming matrix V, as shown in equation (2). Transmitter 310 may then select the precoding matrix W based on the selection criterion of the selected precoding matrix W being closest to the beamforming matrix V among all precoding matrices in the codebook, as described above. Transmitter 310 and receiver 320 may be able to select the same precoding matrix W due to (i) the MIMO channel matrix obtained by transmitter 310 resembling the MIMO channel matrix obtained by receiver 320 due to chaimel reciprocity and (ii) the same selection criterion being used by both transmitter 310 and receiver 320.<br>
[0051] The received symbols for MIMO transmissions on the downlink and uplink may be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
where HDL and HUL are MIMO chaimel matrices for the downlink and uplink, respectively, XDL and XUL are vectors of transmitted symbols for the downlink and uplink, roL and FUL are vectors of received symbols for the downlink and uplink, and ODL and nuL are vectors of noise and interference for the downlink and uplink.<br>
[0052] For a TDD system,, the MIMO channel matrix obtained by transmitter 310 may be reciprocal of the MIMO channel matrix ohtgdocd by receiver 320. This reciprocity may result in HDL = HUL in equation set (8). However, the noise and interference observed by receiver 320 may not match the noise and interference observed by transmitter 310. This may result in DDL being different finm OUL in equation set (8). In one design, the difference in noise and interference may be accounted for by having receiver 320 determine the CQI/MCS value for each layer based on the noise and interference observed by receiva* 320. Furthermore, receiver 320 may determine the CQI/MCS value for each layer based on the MIMO detection<br>
 <br>
technique used by receiver 320, which may be unknown to transmitter 3iO. For this design, transmitter 310 may use the CQI/MCS value provided by receiver 320 for each layer. In another design, receiver 320 may send to transmitter 310 information indicative of the noise and interference observed by receiver 320. This information may comprise the noise variance (T, the noise covariance matrix Rnn&gt; or some other information. Transmitter 310 may then determine the CQI/MCS value for each layer based on the information received from receiver 320. In yet another design, receiver 320 may send to transmitter 310 information indicative of the difference between the noise and interference observed by receiver 320 and the noise and interference observed by transmitter 310. This mformation may comprise CQI, MCS, noise variance, or some other information that can be used by transmitter 310 to compare against corresponding CQI, MCS, noise variance, etc., obtained by transmitter 310. Transmitter 310 may then determine the CQI/MCS value for each layer based on the noise and interference observed by transmitter 310 and the information received from receiver 320. For clarity, the following description assumes the design in which receiver 320 sends CQI/MCS information to transmitter 310.<br>
[0053] Transmitter 310 may send S symbol streams on S layers and may process (e.g., encode and modulate) each symbol stream based on the CQI/MCS value for that symbol stream (step 10). In one design, transmitter 310 may process the S symbol streams based directly on the CQI/MCS values obtained from receiver 320. In another design, transmitter 310 may adjust the CQI/MCS valuw, e.g., to account for any difference betvwen the transmit power assumed by receiver 320 in determining the CQI/MCS values and the transmit power actually used by transmitter 310. Transmitter 310 may then process the S symbol streams based on the adjusted CQI/MCS values. [0054] Transmitter 310 may scale the S symbol streams based on the transmit power used for these symbol streams. Transmitter 310 may also perform precodli for the S symbol streams based on the precoding matrix W selected by transmitter 310 (also step 10). The symbol scaling and precoding may be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
where x is a Txl vector of transmitted symbols. Transmitter 310 may then send a MIMO transmission comprising the S symbol streams to receive: 320 (also step 10).<br>
 <br>
[0055] The techniques described herein may be used for MIMO transmissions on the downlink as well as the uplink. In one design of MIMO transmission on the downlink, a Node B may transmit a downlink reference signal or a common pilot via T antennas at the Node B (step 1). A UE may estimate the downlink MIMO chaimel response based on the downlink ref(»-ence signal or common pilot and may obtain a downlink MIMO channel matrix HDL (step 2). The UE may also estimate the noise and interference observed by the UE (step 3). The UE may select a precoding matrix W based on the downlink MIMO channel matrix and in accordance with a selection criterion, e.g., the closest distance to a beamforming matrix VDL obtained from the downlink MIMO channel matrix (step 4). The UE may determine S CQI values for S symbol streams based on the selected precoding matrix W and the estimated noise and interference and with consideration of the transmit power difference for the downlink and uplink (step 5). The UE may send the S CQI values to the Node B (step 6). [0056] The UE may also send a sounding reference signal or pilot via the R antennas at the UE (step 7). The Node B may estimate the uplink MIMO channel response based on the sounding reference signal or pilot and may obtain an uplink MIMO channel matrix HUL (step 8). The Node B may obtain a downlink MIMO chanittl matrix HDL &amp;om the uplink MIMO channel matrix HUL by assuming channel reciprocity. The Node B may then select the precoding matrix W based on the downlink MIMO channel matrix and in accordance with same selection criterion used by the UE (step 9). The Node B may determine S MGS values for S symbol streams based on the S CQI values received from the UE. The Node B may then process the S symbol streams based on the S MCS values and may perform precoding for the S symbol streams based on the selected precoding matrix W (step 10). The Node B may then send a MIMO transmission comprising the S symbol streams to the UE. [0057] In one design of MIMO transmission on the upUnk, a UE may transmit a sounding reference signal or pilot via R antennas at the UE (step 1). A Node B may estimate the uplink MIMO channel response based on t} sounding reference signal or pilot and may obtain an uplink MEMO channel matrix HUL (step 2). The Node B may also estimate the noise and interference observed by the Node B (step 3). The Node B may select a precoding matrix W based on the uplink MIMO channel matrix and in accordance with a selection criterion, e.g., the closest distance to a beamfolming matrix VUL obtained from the uplink MIMO channel matrix (stq&gt; 4).   The Node B may<br>
 <br>
determine S MCS values for S symbol streams based on the selected preceding matrix W and the estimated noise and interference and with consideration of tiie transmit power difference for the downlink and uplink (step 5). The Node B may send the S MCS values to the UE (step 6).<br>
[0058] The Node B may also send a downlink reference signal or comnK&gt;n pilot via the T antennas at the Node B (step 7). The UE may estimate the downlink MIMO channel response based on the downlink reference signal or common pilot and may obtain a downlink MIMO channel matrix HDL (step 8). The UE may obtain an uplink MIMO channel matrix HUL from the downlink MIMO channel matrix HDL by assuming channel reciprocity. The UE may then select the preceding matrix W based on the uplink MIMO channel matrix and in accordance with same selection criterion used by the Node B (step 9). The UE may process S symbol streams based on the S MCS values received from the Node B and may perform preceding for the S symbol streams based on the selected preceding matrix W (step 10). The UE may then send a MIMO transmission comprising the S symbol streams to the Node B. [0059] The techniques described herein may provide certain advantages. The techniques exploit channel reciprocity to reduce feedback to just the CQI/MCS valiMs. The Node B and the UE may both select the preceding matrix based on their estimated MIMO chatmel responses and using the same selection criterion. Hence, ambiguity in the selection of the preceding matrix and feedback of the precodii matrix may both be avoided. The CQI/MCS values may be determined based on the selected preceding matrix as well as the estimated noise and interference at the receiver. The CQI/MCS values may thus be able to account for any differences between the noise and interference at the Node B and the UE. Any differences between the downlink transmit power and the uplink transmit power may be accounted for in the determination of the CQI/MCS values at the receiver or may be adjusted at the transmitter. The downlink reference signal from the Node B and the sounding reference sipal from the UE may be used to support MIMO transmissions on both the downlink and tiie uplink. [0060] FIG. 4 shows a design of a process 400 for sending a MIMO transmission in a wireless communication systrai. Process 400 may be performed by a transmitter, which may be a Node B for MIMO transmission on tiie downlink or a UE for MIMO transmission en the uplink.

The transmitter may select a precoding matrix based on the second reference signal and in accordance with a selection criterion (block 418). The receiver may also select the precoding matrix based on the first reference signal in accordance with the same selection criterion used by the transmitter. The receiver may determine the CQI or MCS information based on the precoding matrix and estimated noise and interference at the receiver.<br>
[0061] In one design of block 418, the transmitter may obtain a MIMO channel matrix based on the second reference signal. The transmitter may obtain a beamforming matrix based on the MIMO channel matrix, e.g., using singular or eigenvalue decomposition. The transmitter may then select the precoding matrix from a codebook of precoding matrices based on the beamforming matrix and in accordance with the selection criterion, which may be the closest distance between the beamforming matrix and the precoding matrix. The precoding matrix may be determined by the transmitter and thus not sent by the receiver, which may reduce feedback overhead. [0062] The transmitter may send a MIMO transmission to the receiver based on the CQI or MCS information and the precoding matrix (block 420). In one design, the transmitter may obtain S CQI values or S MCS values for S symbol streams from the CQI or MCS information, \vbsTe S may be one or greater. The transmitter may adjust the S CQI or MCS values, e.g., to accoimt for difference m the transmit power used by the receiver to determine the CQI or MCS information and the transmit power used by the transmitter for the MIMO transmission. The transmitter may encode and modulate the S symbol streams in accordance with the S CQI or MCS values. The transmitter may also perform precoding for S symbol streams based on S columns of the precoding matrix. In general, the precoding matrix may have one or more columns used for precoding. The precoding matrix may be referred to as a precodii vector if only one column is used for precoding.<br>

The receiver may select a preceding matrix based on the first reference signal and in accordance with a selection criterion also used by the transmitter to select the preceding matrix (block 614). In one design of block 614, the receiver may obtain a MIMO channel matrix based on the first reference signal. The receiver may obtain a beamforming matrix based on the MIMO channel matrix, e.g., using singular or eigenvalue decomposition. The receiver may then select the preceding matrix fi-om a codebook of preceding matrices based on the beamforming matrix and in accordance with the selection criterion, which may be the closest distance between the beamforming matrix and the preceding matrix.<br>
[0065] The receiver may estimate noise and interference at the receiver (block 616). The receiver may determine the number of symbol streams to transmit and CQI or MCS information for the symbol streams based on the preceding matrix, the estimated noise and interference, and possibly ether information such as the difference between the downlink transmit power and the uplink transmit power (block 618).
