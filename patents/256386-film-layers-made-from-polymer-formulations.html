FILM LAYERS MADE FROM POLYMER FORMULATIONS<br>
This invention relates to compositions comprising specific polymer formulations or blends. The polymer formulations or blends preferably comprise:<br>
(A)	at least one ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer or ethylene homoplymer having<br>
specific characteristics, blended together with<br>
(B)	at least one other ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer or ethyline homopolymer<br>
having physical properties different from the polymer of (A).<br>
Such compositions are particularly useful in film applications where low water vapor transmission rates are important (for example film for use in cereal liners).<br>
For many years, the films industry has endeavored to improve water vapor transmission rates by various techniques. Some of these are described, for example, in US-A-5,562,905 (Nummila-Pakarinen et al.), EP- 0 799 274 Bl (Davis), and WO 01/70827 Al, the disclosures of each are incorporated herein by reference. WO 2004/000933 Al, in contrast, describes blends of polyethylene for use in films having very high water vapor transmission rates. US-A-65127,484 (Cribbs et al), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a multiple zone process to make olefin polymers using a single-site catalyst and a Ziegler-Natta catalyst; the polymers are said to be useful in making films.<br>
Prior work in literature highlights the complex relationship between resin morphology, molecular properties, film fabrication conditions and the resulting water vapor barrier performance. Water vapor permeation in polyethylene film occurs mainly through the non-crystalline region of the polymer. Orientation of the crystalline region also has a significant effect on the permeation rate. High resin crystallroity, narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD) and low levels of long chain branching (LCB) favor low water vapor transmission rates (WVTR). These resin properties in combination with the appropriate film fabrication conditions result in a film morphology that presents a more tortuous path to permeating entities.<br>
A blown film resin with good processability, on the other hand, requires properties such as, low melt index, broad MWD, and a high level of LCB, which are contradictory to the requirements for low WVTR.<br><br>
Surprisingly, we have now discovered that film can have synergistically enhanced physical properties, especially when the film is made from a formulation of (A) at least one ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer or ethylene homopolymer and (B) at least one ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer or ethylene homopolymer, wherein (B) has physical properties different from that of (A). In the present invention a balance between good resin processability and WVTR performance was obtained by developing a bimodal, high density polyethylene resin. The resin has WVTR performance equivalent to the market leader and an improved processability as evidenced by the lower back pressure.<br>
The compositions preferably comprise:<br>
(A)	preferably from 35 percent to 65 percent (by weight of the total composition) of at least<br>
one ethylene polymer having:<br>
(i) a density greater than or equal to about 0.94 grams/cubic centimeter (g/cm3), (ii) preferably, a molecular weight distribution (Mw /Mn) from 1.5 to 5, (iii) a melt index (I-) from 0-001 grams/10 minutes (g/10 min) to 1 g/10 min; and .<br>
(B)	preferably from 35 percent to 65 percent (by weight of the total composition) of at least<br>
one ethylene polymer having a density greater than or equal to 0.940 g/cm3, and a melt<br>
index from 50 to 700 g/10 min.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is a film comprising at least one film layer made from a polymer composition, wherein the composition comprises<br>
(A) preferably from 35 percent to 65 percent (by weight of the total composition) of at least one ethylene polymer having:<br>
(i) a density greater than or equal to about 0.94 grams/cubic centimeter (g/cm3),<br>
(ii) preferably, a molecular weight distribution (Mw /Mn) from 1.5 to 5,<br>
(iii) a melt index (I:) from 0.001 grams/10 minutes (g/10<br>
min) to 1 g/10 min; and<br>
(B) preferably from 35 percent (by weight of the total composition) to 65 percent (by weight of the total composition) of at least one ethylene polymer having a density greater than or equal to 0.94 g/crrr1, and a melt index from 50 to 700 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably, the film layer has a water vapor transmission rate, WVTR, of less than or equal to about 0.3 g-mil/(100 in x day), more preferably less than or equal to about 0.25<br><br>
g-mil/(100 in x day), and especially less than or equal to about 0.2 g-mil/(100 in2 x day), as measured in accordance with ASTM F 1249-90.<br>
The composition of matter of the present invention can also be characterized according to its unique molecular architecture as evidenced by multiple detector gel permeation chromatography (GPC). When using a properly calibrated GPC, equipped with a± least a low angle laser light scattering (LS) detector and a refractive index (RI) detector, the compositions of the present invention will exhibit one or preferably both of the following properties: First, the percentage fraction of a GPC-LS chromatogram which has a molecular weight equal to or greater than 1,000,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography with a low angle laser light scattering detector, is at least 2.5 percent but less than or equal to about 20 percent, preferably equal to or less than about 15 percent, and especially equal to or less than about 10 percent, of the total area of the GPC-LS chromatogram. Second, the percentage fraction of a GPC-RI chromatogram which has a molecular weight equal to or less than about 10,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography with a differential refractometer is equal to or greater than about 10 percent, preferably equal to or greater than about 15 percent, especially equal to or greater than about 20 percent and less than about 25 percent of the total area of the GPC-RI chromatogram. A blown film layer comprising a composition having one or preferably both of these GPC characteristics will preferably have a water vapor transmission rate. WVTR, of less than or equal to about 0.3 g-mil/(100 in2, x day).<br>

All compositional percentages used herein are presented on a "by weight" basis, unless designated otherwise.<br>
Test Methods Density<br>
Resin density was measured by the Archimedes displacement method, ASTM D 792-03, Method B, in isopropanol.   Specimens were measured within 1 hour of molding after conditioning in the isopropanol bath at 23°C for 8 min to achieve thermal equilibrium prior to measurement. The specimens were compression molded according to ASTM D-4703-00 Annex A with a 5 min initial heating period at about 190°C and a 15°C/min cooling rate per Procedure C. The specimen was cooled to 45°C in the press with continued cooling until "cool to the touch".<br>
Melt Flaw Bute by Extrusion Plasiomer<br>
Measurements were performed according to ASTM D-1238-03, Condition 190°C/2.16 kg , Condition 190°C/10.0 kg, and Condition 190°C/21.6 kg, to determine melt flow rates   I2, I10, and I2, respectively.    Melt flow rate is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the polymer. Thus, the higher the molecular weight, the lower the melt flow rate, although the relationship is not linear.<br>
Rheology<br>
The sample was compression molded into a disk for rheology measurement. The disks were prepared by pressing the samples into 0.06" (1.5 mm) thick plaques and were subsequently cut into 1 in (25.4 mm) disks. The compression molding procedure was as follows: 350°F (177°C) for 5 min at 1500 psi (1xl04 kPa) under nitrogen purge; cool to ambient temperature (about 23 °C ) while still under nitrogen purge.<br>
The resin rheology was measured on the ARES I (Advanced Rheometric Expansion System) Rheometer. The ARES is a strain controlled rheometer. A rotary actuator (servomotor) applies shear deformation in the form of strain to a sample. In response, the sample generates torque, which is measured by the transducer. Strain and torque are used to<br><br>
calculate dynamic mechanical properties such as modulus and viscosity. The viscoelastic properties of the sample were measured in the melt using a parallel plate set up, at constant strain (5%) and temperature (190°C), and as a function of varying frequency (0.01 to 100 rad/s). The storage modulus (G')3 loss modulus (G"), tan delta, and complex viscosity (eta*) of the resin were determined using Rheometrics Orchestrator software (v. 6.5.8).<br>
Molecular Weight<br>
Described below in Section "Molecular Architecture Determination".<br>
Melt Strength<br>
Melt Strength is measured using a Goettfert Rheotens capillary rheometer to supply molten polymer at a temperature of 190°C and at a rate of 30.26 3/s to a die with an inside diameter of 2.1 mm, a die length of 41.9 cm, and an entrance angle of 90 degrees. The piston diameter is 9.54 mm, the piston velocity is 0.423 mm/s, the shear rate is 33 s-]5 the draw down is 100 mm   The melt is then pulled with the wheels of a Goettfert Rheotens Model 71.97 extensional rheometer with an air gap of 10 cm and an acceleration rate of 2.4 mm2 /s The melt strength is the plateau value of the force in the spin line measured in centinewtons (cN), or the peak value in the case of a lack of a plateau, as is often experienced with high strength materials.<br>
Water Vapor Transmission Rate<br>
The film water vapor transmission rate was determined by ASTM F 1249-90<br>
Polymer Composition<br>
The ethylene homopolymer or interpolymer composition of the present invention comprises at least two components. One of the components is an ethylene polymer having a density of greater than or equal to about 0.94 g/cm3, more preferably 0.95 g/cm3, most preferably greater than about 0.958 g/cm3, and a melt index (determined according to ASTM D-1238-03 Condition 190°C/2.16 kg (formerly known as "Condition (E)" and also known as I2). from about 0.001, more preferably 0.005, most preferably 0.01 to about 1, more preferably 0.5 most preferably 0.1  grams/10 minutes.    Preferably the first component<br><br>
comprises from 35 to 65 more preferably 40 to 55 most preferably 45 to 50 percent by weight of the composition. . A second component of the compositions of the present invention is an ethylene polymer having a density greater than or equal to about 0.94 g/cm3, more preferably 0.95 g/cm3, more preferably 0.958 g/cm3, and a melt index from about 50, more preferably 65, most preferably 80 to 700. more preferably 650, most preferably 600 grams./10 minutes The second component preferably comprises from 35 to 65 percent, more preferably 45 to 60 most preferably from 50 to 55 percent by weight of the total composition.<br>
The ethylene polymers used in the present invention may be homopolymers or inter polymers and may have homogeneous or heterogeneous branching. In general the more comonomer present in the ethylene polymers of the present invention, the greater the WVTR, and so in general homopolymer is preferred. For purposes of the present invention it is most preferred that the homopolymer contains no comonomer but may contain up to 2 weight percent comonomer, preferably no more than 1.5 weight percent and even more preferably no more than 1 weight percent comonomer.<br>
If inter polymers are present, they may be homogeneously or heterogeneously branched. Suitable homogeneously branched inter polymers include homo geneously branched substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5?272?236. Homogeneously branched ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers can also be a linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymer as described in U.S. Pat No. 3,645,992 (Elston).<br>
The substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers discussed above are not "linear" polymers in the traditional sense of the term, as used to describe linear low density polyethylene (for example, Ziegler polymerized linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)), nor are they highly branched polymers, as used to describe low density polyethylene (LDPE). Substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers suitable for use in the present invention are herein defined as in U.S. Pat No. 5,272,236 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,272. Such substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers typically are inter polymers of ethylene with at least one C3-C20 alpha-olefin and/or C4-C16 diolefins. Copolymers of ethylene and 1-octene are especially preferred.<br>
The term “inter polymer” is used herein to indicate a copolymer. or a terpolymer, or the like. That is, at least one other comonomer is polymerized with ethylene to make the inter polymer.   Ethylene copolymerized with two or more comonomers can also be used to<br><br>
make the homogeneously branched substantially linear inter polymers useful in this invention. Preferred comonomers include the C3-C20 alpha-olefins, especially propene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1- hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, l-nonene, and 1-decene, more preferably 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene and 1-octene.<br>
The term "linear ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer" means that the inter polymer does not have long chain branching. That is, the linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inte rpolymer has an absence of long chain branching, as for example the linear low density polyethylene polymers or linear high density polyethylene polymers made using uniform (that is, homogeneous) branching distribution polymerization processes (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992 (Elston)) and are those in which the comonomer is randomly distributed within a given inter polymer molecule and wherein substantially all of the inter polymer molecules have the same ethylene/comonomer ratio within that inter polymer. The term "linear ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer11 does not refer to high pressure branched (free-radical polymerized) polyethylene which is known to those skilled in the art to have numerous long chain branches. The branching distribution of the homogeneously branched linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers is the same or substantially the same as that described for the homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers, with the exception that the linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers do not have any long chain branching. The homogeneous!}' branched linear ethylene/alpha- olefin inter polymers comprise ethylene with at least one C3-C20 alpha-olefin and/or C4-C18 diolefin. Preferred comonomers include the C3-C20 alpha-olefins, especially propene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, and 1-decene, more preferably 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l- pentene and 1-octene.<br>
Both the homogeneously branched substantially linear and linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers can have a single melting point, as opposed to traditional heterogeneously branched Ziegler polymerized ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers having two or more melting points, as determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
The density of the first polyethylene component (as measured in accordance with ASTM D-792-03) for use is the present invention is generally from 0.86 g/cm3 to 0.97 g/cm3, preferably greater than or equal to about 0.94 g/cm3 to 0.97 g/cm , and especialty greater than or equal to about 0.95 g/cm" to 0.97 g/cm .<br><br>
The amount of the first component incorporated into the composition varies depending upon the second ethylene polymer to which it is combined, but is generally about 35-65 percent by weight of the final composition.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyethylines for use in the present invention is conveniently indicated using a melt index measurement according to ASTM D-1238-03, Condition 190cC/2.16 kg (formerly known as "Condition (E)" and also known as I2). Melt index is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the polymer. Thus, the higher the molecular weight, the lower the melt index, although the relationship is not linear.<br>
The melt index limit for the overall ethylene polymer compositions is as high as about 10 g/10 min, preferably about 5 g/10 min, more preferably about 1 g/10 min; and can be as low as 0.001 g/10 min, preferably as low as 0.01 g/10 min, more preferably as low as about 0.1 g/10 min.<br>
Another measurement useful in characterizing the molecular weight of the polyethylenes is conveniently indicated using a melt flow rate measurement according to ASTM D-1238-03, Condition 190°C/10 kg (formerly known as "Condition (N)" and also known as I10). The ratio of the I10 and h terms is referred to as the melt flow ratio and is designated as I10/L- Generally, the I10/k ratio for the homogeneously branched linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers which may be used in the present invention is about 5.6.<br>
For the homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers and ethylene homopolymers which may be used in the compositions of the invention, the I10/I2 ratio indicates the degree of long chain branching, that is, the higher the I10/I2 ratio, the more long chain branching in the inter polymer. Generally, the I10/I2 ratio of the homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers is at least 6, preferably at least 7, especially at least 8 or above. For the homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers, the higher the I10/I2 ratio, the better the processability.<br>
Other additives such as antioxidants (for example, hindered phenolics (e. g.; Irganox 1010 made by Ciba Geigy Corp.), phosphites (for example, Irgafos 168 also made by Ciba Geigy Corp.)), cling additives (for example, PIB), anti block additives; pigments, fillers, can also be included in the formulations, to the extent that they do not interfere with the enhanced formulation properties discovered by Applicants.<br><br>
Molecular Architecture Determination<br>
The preferred polyethylene composition of the present invention can also be characterized as having a percentage fraction of a GPC-LS chromatogram which has a molecular weight equal to or greater than 1,000,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography with a low angle laser light scattering detector is at least about 2.5 percent but no more than about 20 percent, more preferably no more than about 15 percent, even more preferably no more than about 10 percent of the total area of the GPC-LS chromatogram. The ethylene homopolymer or inter polymer composition of the present invention can also be characterized as having a percentage fraction of a GPC-RI chromatogram which has a molecular weight equal to or less than about 10,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography with a differential refractometer is equal to or greater than about 10 percent, more preferably 15 percent, even more preferably 20 percent and preferably no more than about 25 percent of the total area of the GPC-RI chromatogram.<br>
In order to determine the molecular architecture of various polymer compositions, the following procedure was used:<br>
The chromatographic system consisted of a Waters (Millford, MA) 150C high temperature chromatograph equipped with a Precision Detectors (Amherst, MA) 2-angle laser light scattering detector Model 2040. The 15-degree angle of the light scattering detector was used for the calculation of molecular weights. Data collection was performed using Viscotek TriSEC software version 3 and a 4-channel Viscotek Data Manager DM400. The system was equipped with an on-line solvent degas device from Polymer Laboratories.<br>
The carousel compartment was operated at 140°C and the column compartment was operated at 150°C. The columns used were 4 Shodex HT 8O6M 13-micron columns. The solvent used was L2,4 trichlorobenzene. The samples were prepared at a concentration of 0.1 grams of polymer in 50 milliliters of solvent. The chromatographic solvent and the sample preparation solvent contained 200 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Both solvent sources were nitrogen sparged. Polyethylene samples were stirred gently at 160 degrees Celsius for 4 hours. The injection volume used was 200 micro liters and the flow rate was 0.63 milliliters/minute.<br><br>
Calibration of the GPC column set was performed with a minimum of 15 narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 8,400,000 and were arranged in 6 "cocktail" mixtures with at least a decade of separation between individual molecular weights. The standards were purchased from Polymer Laboratories (Shropshire, UK). The polystyrene standards were prepared at 0.025 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights equal to or greater than 1,000.000, and 0.05 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for "molecular weights less than 1,000,000. The polystyrene standards were dissolved at 80 degrees Celsius with gentle agitation for 30 minutes. The narrow standards mixtures were run first and in order of decreasing highest molecular weight component to minimize degradation. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights were converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the Equation 1 (as described in Williams and Ward, J. Polym. Sci, Polym.

The Systematic Approach for the determination of multi-detector offsets was done in a manner consistent with that published by Balke, Mourey, et. Al (Mourey and Balke;<br><br>
Chromatography Polym. Chpt 12, (1992)) (Bailee, Thitiratsakul, Lew, Cheung, Mourey, Chrornatography Polym. Chpt 13, (1992)), optimizing dual detector log results from Dow broad polystyrene 1683 to the narrow standard column calibration results from the narrow standards calibration curve using in-house software. The molecular weight data for off-set determination was obtained in a manner consistent with that published by Zimm (Zimm,B,H, IChem. Phys., 16, 1099 (1948)) and Kratochvil (Kratochvil, P., Classical Light Scattering from Polymer Solutions, Elsevier, Oxford, NY (1987)). The overall injected concentration used for the determination of the molecular weight was obtained from the sample refractive index area and the refractive index detector calibration from a linear polyethylene homopolymer of 115,000 molecular weight. The chromatographic concentrations were assumed low enough to eliminate addressing 2nd Virial coefficient effects (concentration effects on molecular weight).<br>
In order to monitor the deviations over time, which may contain an elution component (caused by chromatographic changes) and a flowrate component (caused by pump changes), a late eluting narrow peak is generally used as a "marker peak". A flowrate marker was therefore established based on the air peak mismatch between the degassed chromatographic system solvent and the elution sample on one of the polystyrene cocktail mixtures. This flowrate marker was used to linearly correct the flowrate for all samples by alignment of the air peaks. Any changes in the time of the marker peak are then assumed to be related to a linear shift in both flowrate and chromatographic slope.<br>
To facilitate the highest accuracy of a RV measurement of the flow marker peak, a least-squares fitting routine is used to fit the peak of the flow marker concentration chromatogram to a quadratic equation. The first derivative of the quadratic equation is then used to solve for the true peak position. After calibrating the system based on a flow marker peak, the effective flowrate (as a measurement of the calibration slope) is calculated as Equation 4. In a high-temperature SEC system, an antioxidant mismatch peak or an air peak (if the mobile phase is sufficiently degassed) can be used as an effective flow marker. The primary features of an effective flowrate marker are as follows: the flow marker should be mono-dispersed. The flow marker should elute close to the total column permeation volume. The flow marker should not interfere with the chromatographic integration window of the sample.<br><br>

The preferred column set is of 13 micron particle size and "mixed" porosity to adequately separate the highest molecular weight fractions appropriate to the claims.<br>
The verification of adequate column separation and appropriate shear rate can be made by viewing the low angle (less than 20 degrees) of the on-line light scattering detector on an NBS 1476 high, pressure low density polyethylene standard. The appropriate light scattering chromatogram should appear bimodal (very high MW peak and moderate molecular weight peak) with approximately equivalent peak heights as shown in the Figure 0. There should be adequate separation by demonstrating a trough height between the two peaks less than half of the total LS peak height. The plate count for the chromatographic system (based on elcosane as discussed previously) should be greater than 32,000 and symmetry should be between LOO and 1.12.<br>
"The calculation of the cumulative detector fractions (CDF) for the refractoraeter ("CDF RT) and the low angle laser light scattering detector ("CDF LS") are accomplished by the following steps:<br>
1)	Linearly flow correct the chromatogram based on the relative retention volume ratio<br>
of the air peak "between the sample and that of a consistent narrow standards cocktail<br>
mixture.<br>
2)	Correct the light scattering detector offset relative to the refractometer as described<br>
in the calibration section.<br>
3)	Subtract baselines from the light scattering and refractometer chromatograms and set<br>
integration windows making certain to integrate all of the low molecular weight<br>
retention volume range in the light scattering chromatogram that is observable from<br>
the refractometer chromatogram.<br>
4)	Calculate the   molecular weights at  each data slice based on the polystyrene<br>
calibration curve, modified by the polystyrene to polyethylene conversion factor<br>
(0.4315) as described in the calibration section.<br><br>
5) Calculate the cumulative detector fraction (CDF) of each chromatogram (CDFRJ and CDFLS) based on its baseline-subtracted peak height (H) from high to low molecular weight (low to high retention volume) at each data slice ( i ) according to the Equation 5:<br>
Equations. <br>
where i is between the Lowest RV index and the Highest RV index<br>
6) A plot of CDF versus molecular weight is obtained by calculating the CDF at each integrated data slice from step (5) and plotting it versus the log of the polyethylene equivalent molecular weight at each integrated data slice from step (4).<br>
Using this GPC method, an analysis was done on the following resins: a commercially available comparative example 2, and example 1 of the invention. The plots for these materials are shown in Figures 1 and 2. These figures also indicate the log of 10,000 MW for the CDFRI plot and the log of 1,000,000 MW for CDFLS plot. From these lines it can clearly be seen that none of the comparative examples meet both the CDFLS criteria for the present invention and the CDFRI criteria for the present invention.<br>
As known by a person of ordinary skill in the art, the chromatographic moments representing the number-average molecular weight of the distribution can be calculated from the polyethylene-equivalent calibration curve where the weight fraction is obtained from the normalization of the refractometer height as a function of the volume slice (i) as shown in Equation 6.<br><br><br>
For the Mw and Mz calculations, the molecular weight can be obtained from absolute light scattering measurements using equations 7 and 8.<br><br>
The Heterogeneously Branched Ethylene Polymer<br>
Preferably, the ethylene polymer to be combined with the first component is an ethylene homopolymer, but could also be a heterogeneously branched (for example, Ziegler-Natta polymerized) inter polymer of ethylene with at least one C3-C20 alpha-olefin (for example, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)). For ethylene homopolymer, the density is typically about 0.97 g/cubic centimeter, but the measured density can be slightly lower, for example, greater than or equal to about 0.94 g/cm5 for very high molecular weight ethylene homopolymers, such as the molecular weights required for component (A) of the invention (melt indices from 0.001 to 1 g/10 ruin).<br>
Heterogeneously branched ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers differ from the homogeneously branched ethylene/alpha-olefin inter polymers primarily in their branching distribution- For example, heterogeneously branched LLDPE polymers have a distribution of branching, including a highly branched portion (similar to a very low density polyethylene), a medium branched portion (similar to a medium branched polyethylene) and an essentially linear portion (similar to linear homopolymer polyethylene). Such manufacturing techniques for making the keterogeneously branched ethylene polymer is taught in U.S. Patent 3,914,342 (Mitchell) and U.S. Patent 4,076,698 (Anderson et al).<br>
Examples of catalyst suitable for preparing the heterogeneous component are described in U.S. Pat Nos. 4,314,912 (Lowery et al.), U.S. Pat No. 4,547,475 (Glass et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698 (Anderson)., and 4,612,300 (Coleman, IH); examples of catalyst suitable for producing the homogeneous component are described in U.S. Pat Nos. 5,026,798 and 5,055,438 (Canich); 3,645,992 (Elston); 5,017,714 (Welbom); and 5,064,802 (Stevens et al.).<br>
The amount of each of these fractions varies depending upon the whole polymer properties desired. For example, linear homopolymer polyethylene has neither branched nor<br><br>
highly branched fractions, but is linear A very low density heterogeneous polyethylene having a density from 0.9 g/cm3 to 0.915 g/cm3 (such as ATTANE™ copolymers, sold by The Dow Chemical Company and FLEXOMER sold by Union Carbide Corporation) has a higher percentage of the highly short chain branched fraction, thus lowering the density of the whole polymer.<br>
Heterogeneously branched LLDPE (such as DOWLEX™ sold by The Dow Chemical Company) has a lower amount of the highly branched fraction, but has a greater amount of the medium branched fraction.<br>
The Formulated Compositions<br>
The compositions disclosed herein can be formed by any convenient method, including dry blending the individual components and subsequently melt mixing or by pre-melt mixing in a separate extruder (e. g., a Banbury mixer, a Haake mixer, a Brabender internal mixer, or a twin screw extruder).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,844,045, U.S. Patent No. 5,869,575 and U.S. Patent No. 6,448,341 describes, inter alia, inter polymerizations of ethylene and, optionally, C3-C20 alpha-olefins. using a homogeneous catalyst in at least one reactor and a heterogeneous catalyst in at least one other reactor. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,566,446 (Parish et al.) and 6,538,070 (Cardwell et al.) disclose ethylene inter polymerizations using a homogeneous catalyst in two different reactors, where the polymerization conditions vary so as to affect the reactivity of the catalysts. In any case, the reactors can be operated sequentially or in parallel. In any case, the catalyst components (which may include activators, modifiers, and cocatalysts) can be injected very close to each other, for example, each injection point is within two linear feet of every other catalyst component injection point, (but not necessarily pre-mixed) in the same reactor.<br>
The compositions can also be made by fractionating a heterogeneous ethylene/alpha-olefin polymer into specific polymer fractions with each fraction having a narrow composition (that is, branching) distribution, selecting the fraction having the specified properties, and blending the selected fraction in the appropriate amounts with another ethylene polymer. This method is obviously not as economical as the in-situ inter polymerizations of U.S. Patent No. 5,844,045, U.S. Patent No. 5,869,575, U.S. Patent<br><br>
No. 6,566,446, U.S. Patent No. 6:538,070, and U.S. Patent No. 6,448,341, but can be used to obtain the compositions of the invention.<br>
There are a variety of ways to make these types of polymers, and include slurry, solution and gas phase polymerizations, especially preferred is the solution process. Various patents disclose polymerization techniques, including USP 4,076,698 (Andersen et al), USP 5,977,251 (Kao et al.) and WO 97/36942 (Kao et al), the disclosures of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. By "solution" process it is meant that the polymer, typically 10-30 percent by weight of the solution, but which can be as high as 30-50 percent by weight of the solution and unconverted monomer(s) are substantially dissolved in the solvent; although  it should be understood that solids and gases (including undissolved monomer) may be present in this "solution" without resulting in substantial gel production, and in fact minimizing gel formation. Sometimes, the support for the catalyst is inert and not soluble in the solution, but is suspended in the "solution." Unsupported catalysts, however, can be soluble in the solution and become part of the liquid phase. However, the "solution" is substantially in a liquid phase. Another solution process is described in U.S. Patent 3,914,342 (Mitchell).<br>
Fabricated Articles Made from the Novel Compositions<br>
Many useful fabricated articles benefit from the novel compositions disclosed herein. For example, molding operations can be used to form useful fabricated articles or parts from the compositions disclosed herein, including various injection molding processes (for example, that described in Modern Plastics Encyclopedia/89, Mid October 1988 Issue, Volume 65, Number 11, pp. 264-268, "Introduction to Injection Molding" by EL Randall Parker and on pp. 270-271, "injection Molding Thermoplastics" by Michael W. Green, and blow molding processes (for example, that described in Modem Plastics Encyclopedia/89. Mid October 1988 Issue, Volume 65, Number 11, pp. 217-218, "Extrusion-Blow Molding1' by Christopher Irwin, profile extrusion, calandering, pultrusion (for example, pipes). Rotomolded articles can also benefit from the novel compositions described herein. Rotomolding techniques are well known to those skilled in the art and include, for example, those described in Modern Plastics Encyclopedia/89, Mid October 1988 Issue, Volume 65, Number 11, pp. 296-301, "Rotational Molding" by R.L. Fair.<br><br>
Fibers (for example, staple fibers, melt blown fibers or spunbonded fibers (using, for example, systems as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,340,563, 4,663,220, 4,668,566, or 4,322,027, and gel spun fibers (for example, the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,413.110). both woven and nonwoven fabrics (for example, spunlaced fabrics disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 3, 4S5.706, or structures made from such fibers (including, for example, blends of these fibers with, other fibers, for example, PET or cotton)) an also be made from the novel compositions disclosed herein.<br>
Film and film structures particularly benefit from the novel compositions described herein and can be made using conventional hot blown film fabrication techniques or other biaxial orientation processes such as tenter frames or double bubble processes. A blown film layer comprising the composition preferably has a water vapor transmission rate, WVTR, of less than or equal to about 0.3 g-mil/(100 in x day), as measured in accordance with ASTM F 1249-90.<br>
Conventional hot blown film processes are described, for example, in The Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk-Othmer, Third Edition., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981. Vol. 16, pp. 416-417 and Vol. IS, pp. 191-192. Biaxial orientation -film manufacturing process such as described in a "double bubble" process as in U.S. Pat No. 3,456,044 (Pahlke), and the processes described in U.S. Pat No. 4,352,849 (Mueller), U.S. Pat No. 4,597,920 (Golike), U.S. Pat No. 4:S20r557 (Warren), U.S. Pat. No. 4, 837,084 (Wairen), U.S. Pat No. 4,865,902 (Golike et aL), U.S. Pat No. 4,927,708 (Herran et aL), U.S. Pat No. 4,952,451 (Mueller), U.S. Pat No. 4,963,419 (Lustig et al), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,481 (Lustig et al), can also be used to make film structures from the novel compositions described herein. The film structures can also be made as described in a tenter-frame technique, such as that used for oriented polypropylene.<br>
Other multi-layer film manufacturing techniques for food packaging applications are described in Packaging Foods With Plastics, by Wilmer A. Jenkins and James P. Harrington (1991), pp. 19-27, and in "Coextrusion Basics" by Thomas I. Butler, Film Extrusion Manual: Process, Materials. Properties pp. 31-80 (published by TAPPI Press (1992)).<br>
The films may be monolayer or multilayer films. The film made from the novel compositions can also be coextruded with the other layer(s) or the film can be laminated onto another layer(s) in a secondary operation, such as that described in Packaging Foods With Plastics, by Wilmer A. Jenkins and James P. Harrington (1991) or that described in<br><br>
"Coextrusion For Barrier Packaging" by W. J. Schrenk and C. R. Finch, Society of Plastics Engineers RETEC Proceedings, Jun. 15-17 (1981), pp. 211-229. If a monolayer film is produced via tubular film (that is, blown film techniques) or flat die (that is, cast film) as described by K. R. Osbom and W. A. Jenkins in "Plastic Films, Technology and Packaging Applications" (Technomic Publishing Co., Inc. (1992)), then the film must go through an additional post-extrusion step of adhesive or extrusion lamination to other packaging material layers to form a multilayer structure. If the film is a coextrusion of two or more layers (also described by Osborn and Jenkins), the film may still be laminated to additional layers of packaging materials, depending on the other physical requirements of the final film.<br>
"Laminations Vs. Coextrusion" by D. Dumbleton (Converting Magazine (September 1992)), also discusses lamination versus coextrusion. Monolayer and coextruded films can also go through other post extrusion techniques, such as a biaxial orientation process.<br>
Extrusion coating is yet another technique for producing multilayer film structures using the novel compositions described herein. The novel compositions comprise at least one layer of the film structure. Similar to cast film, extrusion coating is a fiat die technique, A sealant can be extrusion coated onto a substrate either in the form of a monolayer or a coextruded extrudate.<br>
The films and film layers of this invention are especially useful in vertical-form-fill-    seal (VTFS) applications. Patents describing improvements for VFFS applications, especially polymer improvements, include US 5,228,531; US 5,360,648; US 5,364,486; US 5,721,025; US 5,879,768; US 5,942,579; US 6,117,465.<br>
The films and film layers of this invention are also useful as grease barriers such as food packaging applications (for example, dog food packaging).<br>
Generally for a multilayer film structure, the novel compositions described herein comprise at least one layer of the total multilayer film structure. Other layers of the multilayer structure include but are not limited to barrier layers, and/or tie layers, and/or structural layers.<br>
Various materials can be used for these layers, with some of them being used as more than one layer in the same film structure. Some of these materials include: foil, nylon, ethylene/vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymers, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene, oriented polypropylene (OPP), ethylene/vinyl acetate<br><br>
(EVA) copolymers, ethylene/aciylic acid (EAA) copolymers, ethylene/methacrylic acid (EMAA) copolymers, LLDPE, HDPE, LDPE, nylon, graft adhesive polymers (for example, maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene), and paper. Generally, the multilayer film structures comprise from 2 to 7 layers.<br>
Film can be made by cast extrusion (for raonolayer films) or coextrusion (fox miltilaysr Sims) by techniques well known in the art The films can be quenched, irradiated by electron beam irradiation at a dosage of between 20 and 35 kiloGrays, and reheated to their orientation temperature, and then stretched at a ratio of 5:1 in each of the longitudinal and transverse directions.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Example 1 is an in-situ blend made according to U.S. Patent No. 5,844.045 (Kolthammer et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5,869,575 and U.S. Patent No. 6,448,341 _ wherein the homogeneously branched polymer is made in a first reactor and is an ethylene homopolymer having a melt index (I2) of about 0.02 g/10 min., and a density of greater than, about 0.955 g/cm\ and a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of about 2 and comprises about 45 percent   by  weight  of the  total   composition.  A  heterogeneously  branched   ethylene<br><br>
homopolymer is made in a second reactor operated sequentially -with the first reactor such that the final composition has a melt index (I?) of about 0.9 g/10 min., and a density of greater than about 0.955 g/cm3; the heterogeneous component comprises the remaining 55 percent by weight of the total composition. The resin was produced by reactor blending a narrow MWD fraction produced by a constrained geometry catalyst in the first reactor, using those catalysts as described in U. S. Patent 5,965.756 and U.S. Patent 6,034,022, and a broad MWD fraction produced by a standard Ziegler-Natta catalyst in a sequential second reactor, using those cataleysts as described in U. S. Patent 3,257,332, U.S. Patent 3,051,690, U.S. Patent 4,314,912 (Lowery, Jr. et al), U.S. Patent 4,547,475 (Glass et al.), U.S. Patent 4,612,300 (Coleraan, HI) and U.S. Patent 4,659,685 (Coleman, HI). The total composition has a melt index (I2) of about 0.8-0.9 g/10 min, a density of about 0.96 g/cm3, a melt flow ratio (I10 /I2) of about 12 to 14. I21/I3. of less than about 70 and a molecular weight distribution [Mw/Mn)] of about 8.4, as described in Table 1.<br>
The resin composition is fabricated into a three-layer (A/A/A) blown film with water vapor barrier properties as described in Table 2. The three layer film was fabricated on a co-extrusion blown film line consisting of two 2.5 inch, 24 L/D Egan extruders and a one 2 inctL 24 L/D Johnson extruder. The extruders are powdered by 60 (Extruder 1, outer layer), 75 (Extruder 2, core layer) and 20 (Extruder 3, inner layer) HP DC motors. Extruder 1 is equipped with a 2.88 compression ratio Newcastle single flight high shear screw with Twisted Egan Z Mixer. Extruder 2 is equipped with a 2.35 compression ratio DSB II barrier screw with Maddock Mixer. Extruder 3 is equipped with a 2.5 compression ratio Johnson single flight screw with Maddock Mixer. An 8 inch, Bottenfeld Gloucester 3 layer (32/36/32 layer ratio) die with internal bubble cooling and a 70 roil die pin was used. All the extruders are smooth bore with barrel heating and cooling. The pressure is monitored by pressure transducers on each extruder. An Extrol 6032 Microprocessor controls extrusion parameters such as rpm, % FLC (full load capacity) horse power (HP), rate, lay flat width and melt temperature on each extruder.<br>
The resin is further used as the water vapor barrier layer in a coextruded multilayer (A/A/A)   blown   film      and   the   resultant   film  properties   are   reported   in   Table   3<br><br><br><br>

Table 2 shows an improved resin processability and water vapor transmission performance balance for Example 1 as compared to the comparative examples.<br><br>
Table 3 Multilayer Film Characteristics: Film Composition A/A/A where A = Moisture<br>
Barrier Resin<br><br>
In general films made from the novel formulated ethylene compositions<br><br>
exhibitt good bubble stability during fabrication, and an especially good low water vapor transmission rate.<br>
The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of HDPE film is strongly affected by the morphology of the crystalline fraction. We found that high molecular weight (MW) fraction, even when present at low concentration, can induce a shish-kabob crystalline morphology that is determinal to WVTR performance. Thus, a narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD) is preferred to prevent the occurrence of the undesirable shish-kabob morphology by eliminating the high molecular weight component. Also, one skilled in the art would know that long chain branching (LCB) would be undesirable, since chain entanglements would retard relaxation of the branched molecules. On the other hand, in order to obtain good resin processability, broad MWD and presence of LCB are desirable.<br>
In this invention, contrary to the current understanding of the MWD-LCB-WVTR relationship, we have discovered that broad MWD resins with good WVTR performance can be made. This was achieved by utilizing a single site-metallocene catalyst a biraodal MWD, and elimination of high molecular weight fractions. Surprisingly, the LCB from a single-site constrained geometry catalyst does not cause the undesired shish kabob morphology. Thus, a bimodal single site constrained geometry- based HDPE molecular architecture provides improved processability and at the same time provides a better barrier to water vapor transmission. HDPE film with good water vapor barrier properties finds application in dry food packaging as they increase the food shelf life.<br><br><br>
