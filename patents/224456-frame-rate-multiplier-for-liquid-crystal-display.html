Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention arrangements relate to the field of LCOS<br>
(liquid crystal on silicon) and/or LCD (liquid crystal<br>
display) video display systems, both reflective and<br>
transmissive.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) can be thought of as one<br>
large liquid crystal formed on a silicon wafer. The silicon<br>
wafer is divided into an incremental array of tiny plate<br>
electrodes. A tiny incremental region of the liquid crystal<br>
is influenced by the electric field generated by each tiny<br>
plate and the common plate. Each such tiny plate and<br>
corresponding liquid crystal region are together referred to<br>
as a cell of the imager. Each cell corresponds to an<br>
individually controllable pixel. A common plate electrode is<br>
disposed on the other side of the liquid crystal. Each cell,<br>
or pixel, remains lighted with the same intensity until the<br>
input signal is changed, thus acting as a sample and hold.<br>
The pixel does not decay, as is the case with the phosphors in<br>
a cathode ray tube. Each set of common and variable plate<br>
electrodes forms an imager. One imager is provided for each<br>
color, in this case, one imager each for red, green and blue.<br>
It is typical to drive the imager of an LCOS display with<br>
a frame-doubled signal to avoid 30 Hz flicker, by sending<br>
first a normal frame (positive picture) and then an inverted<br>
frame (negative picture) in response to a given input picture.<br>
The generation of positive and negative pictures ensures that<br>
each pixel will be written with a positive electric field<br>
followed by a negative electric field. The resulting drive<br>
field has a zero DC component, which is necessary to avoid the<br>
image sticking, and ultimately, permanent degradation of the<br>
imager. It has been determined that the human eye responds to<br>
the average value of the brightness of the pixels produced by<br>
these positive and negative pictures.<br>
The drive voltages are supplied to plate electrodes on<br>
each side of the LCOS array. In the presently preferred LCOS<br>
system to which the inventive arrangements pertain, the common<br>
plate is always at a potential of about 8 volts. This voltage<br>
can be adjustable. Each of the other plates in the array of<br>
tiny plates is operated in two voltage ranges. For positive<br>
pictures, the voltage varies between 0 volts and 8 volts. For<br>
negative pictures the voltage varies between 8 volts and 16<br>
volts.<br>
The light supplied to the imager, and therefore supplied<br>
to each cell of the imager, is field polarized. Each liquid<br>
crystal cell rotates the polarization of the input light<br>
responsive to the root mean square (RMS) value of the electric<br>
field applied to the cell by the plate electrodes. Generally<br>
speaking, the cells are not responsive to the polarity<br>
(positive or negative) of the applied electric field. Rather,<br>
the brightness of each pixel's cell is generally only a<br>
function of the rotation of the polarization of the light<br>
incident on the cell. As a practical matter, however, it has<br>
been found that the brightness can vary somewhat between the<br>
positive and negative field polarities for the same<br>
polarization rotation of the light. Such variation of the<br>
brightness can cause an undesirable flicker in the displayed<br>
picture.<br>
In this embodiment, in the case of either positive or<br>
negative pictures, as the field driving the cells approaches a<br>
zero electric field strength, corresponding to 8 volts, the<br>
closer each cell comes to white, corresponding to a full on<br>
condition. Other systems are possible, for example where the<br>
common voltage is set to 0 volts. It will be appreciated that<br>
the inventive arrangements taught herein are applicable to all<br>
such positive and negative field LCOS imager driving systems.<br>
Pictures are defined as positive pictures when the<br>
variable voltage applied to the tiny plate electrodes is less <br>
than the voltage applied to the common plate electrode,<br>
because the higher the tiny plate electrode voltage, the<br>
brighter the pixels. Conversely, pictures are defined as<br>
negative pictures when the variable voltage applied to the<br>
tiny plate electrodes is greater than the voltage applied to<br>
the common plate electrode, because the higher the tiny plate<br>
electrode voltage, the darker the pixels. The designations of<br>
pictures as positive or negative should not be confused with<br>
terms used to distinguish field types in interlaced video<br>
formats.<br>
The present state of the art in LCOS requires the<br>
adjustment of the common-mode electrode voltage, denoted Vito,<br>
to be precisely between the positive and negative field drive<br>
for the LCOS. The subscript ITO refers to the material indium<br>
tin oxide. The average balance is necessary in order to<br>
minimize flicker, as well as to prevent a phenomenon known as<br>
image sticking.<br>
In the following description, the term fHin is used<br>
herein to denote the horizontal scanning frequency of an input<br>
video signal. The term fVin is used to denote the vertical<br>
scanning frequency of an input video signal. In the standard<br>
definition interlaced NTSC system, fHin might be 15,750 Hz<br>
(1fH) Or 31,500 Hz (2fn).Typically, fvin is 60 Hz for NTSC<br>
and 50 Hz for PAL. High definition formats have been defined<br>
by the ATSC. The term 480p refers to a video signal having<br>
480 lines of video in each progressive (non-interlaced) frame.<br>
A 720p video signal has 720 lines of video in each frame. The<br>
term 1080i refers to a video signal having 1,080 interlaced<br>
horizontal lines in top and bottom fields, each field having<br>
540 horizontal lines. In accordance with this convention, the<br>
term 720i would denote 720 lines of interlaced video per frame<br>
and the term 1080p would denote 1,080 lines of progressive<br>
horizontal lines in each frame. Typically, such high<br>
definition systems have an fHin ³ 2fH.<br>
The letter n is used herein to denote a multiple of fHin<br>
or fVin. Assume, for example, that a 480p input video signal<br>
is speeded up by the multiple n = 2. Since fHin = 2fH the<br>
horizontal scanning frequency is doubled to 4fH- Assume, for<br>
example, that the same 480p input video signal is subjected to<br>
a 1/n-frame delay, also where n = 2. Since the 480p input<br>
video signal has an fVin = 60 Hz, the delay is 1/120 second.<br>
The multiple n need not be an integer. If fHin = 2.14fH, and<br>
n = 2, the video signal is speeded up to 4.28fH. A 720p video<br>
signal, for example, has fHin = 3fH- If fHin = 3fH and n = 2,<br>
the video signal is speeded up to 6fH-<br>
In order to avoid visible flicker, it is common practice<br>
to use a higher vertical scanning frequency, or frame rate, to<br>
suppress flicker. In an NTSC system, for example, if n = 2 a<br>
frame rate of 60 Hz is doubled to a frame rate of 120 Hz. In<br>
a PAL system, a field rate of 50 Hz is doubled to a field rate<br>
of 100 Hz. However, the higher frame rate or field rate makes<br>
adjustment of the common mode electrode voltage more difficult<br>
because the flicker is not visible to the human eye. An<br>
operator can not make the necessary adjustments without<br>
special instruments.<br>
Faster frame rates have required frame rate doublers,<br>
that is, a circuit that can cause each picture to be scanned<br>
twice within each frame period of the incoming video signal.<br>
A 60 Hz frame rate has a frame period of 1/60 second. Doubling<br>
a frame rate of 60 Hz requires scanning at 120 Hz. A 120 Hz<br>
frame rate has a frame period of 1/120 second. If an incoming<br>
video signal has a horizontal scanning frequency of 2fH/ where<br>
fH is for example a standard NTSC horizontal scanning rate,<br>
and a standard frame rate of 6 0 Hz, the pictures must be<br>
displayed at 4fH and 120 Hz. In other words, each picture<br>
must be displayed twice during each 60 Hz frame period, that<br>
is, in every 1/60 second. Each line must be written to the<br>
display at 4fH.<br>
In accordance with the prior art, frame rate doublers<br>
utilize two full frame memories in a so-called ping-pong<br>
arrangement. A frame is written into one memory as another<br>
frame is read out of the other memory, and vice versa, in an<br>
alternating manner. This technique always incurs a full frame<br>
period of video delay because neither of the ping-pong frame<br>
memories can be read out until a full frame has been written<br>
in. Accordingly, the audio signal must be delayed to match<br>
the video delay. It was known that the memory requirements<br>
could be reduced to one full frame memory by proper<br>
utilization of the memory in a correctly implemented video<br>
speedup arrangement. However, for any frame multiplication<br>
greater than doubling, the alternative use of one full frame<br>
memory is not workable. Two full frame memories are always<br>
required in such a situation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The problems of the prior art in implementing frame rate<br>
doublers, and more generally in providing frame rate<br>
multipliers, are overcome in accordance with the inventive<br>
arrangements. The solutions provided by the inventive<br>
arrangements are particularly appropriate for liquid crystal<br>
displays, for example LCOS. Moreover, the savings in memory<br>
requirements in accordance with certain embodiments enable<br>
more of the frame rate multiplier to be integrated.<br>
A frame rate multiplier in accordance with the inventive<br>
arrangements can be implemented by writing the incoming video<br>
signal directly to the display, for example an LCOS display,<br>
as well as to a frame rate multiplier memory. In the case of<br>
a frame rate doubler, for example, this advantageously allows<br>
a one-half frame memory to be used instead of a full frame<br>
memory, and advantageously reduces the memory bandwidth<br>
required. The memory size reduction is very important,<br>
because a half-frame memory can be embedded on an integrated<br>
circuit providing other functions, whereas a full frame memory<br>
is too large, or at least, too expensive to embed. Moreover,<br>
it is advantageously not necessary to delay the audio to match<br>
the frame rate multiplied video, as in the ping-pong memory<br>
arrangement. Speedup memories, for example line memories, can<br>
be used to speed up the signals at the input to the display,<br>
allowing an LCOS display to be used, for example an LCOS<br>
display operating at 4fH.<br>
The smaller memory bandwidth is a sufficient reduction to<br>
simultaneously write to and read from the half-frame memory<br>
with the same bandwidth as the incoming signal. The bandwidth<br>
in this embodiment of the invention is about ? of the<br>
bandwidth needed for the ping-pong arrangement. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, the speedup memory following the half-<br>
frame delay can be omitted if the half-frame memory can be<br>
read intermittently, twice as fast as the half-frame memory is<br>
written. In other words, the half-frame memory is also used<br>
as a speedup memory. This embodiment requires one less<br>
speedup memory, but there is no reduction in the memory<br>
bandwidth, as the half-frame memory must be read at a faster<br>
rate (e.g., 4fH) than the rate of the incoming video signal<br>
(e.g., 2fH). The half-frame memory and both of the speed up<br>
memories can also be combined into a single memory.<br>
It should be noted that the only special characteristic<br>
needed by the display is to have a direct row address select<br>
capability for writing any row selected, as opposed to only<br>
being writable strictly sequentially. In the frame rate<br>
doubler embodiment, successively written rows, or lines, are<br>
separated by half of the picture height. More specifically,<br>
for example, the line, or row, writing sequence for a 480p<br>
display can be 1, 241, 2, 242, and so on.<br>
The frame rate multiplier can advantageously be<br>
implemented together with a number of different schemes for<br>
reversing the polarities of the fields driving the LCOS<br>
display as required. Moreover, the frame rate multiplier<br>
operates in such a way that the flicker due to the difference<br>
In brightness between the positive and negative fields is<br>
advantageously not perceptible.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A frame rate multiplier 10 in accordance with the<br>
inventive arrangements is shown block diagram form in Figure<br>
1. The frame rate multiplier is embodied as a frame rate<br>
doubler in order to simplify the description. A frame rate<br>
multiplier for the general case of multiplying the frame rate<br>
by n, where n &gt; 2, is explained later in connection with<br>
Figures 8 and 9(a)-9(c). An input video signal 12 has a<br>
horizontal scanning frequency of fHin = 2fH and a vertical<br>
scanning frequency fVin = fV. It will be assumed for purposes<br>
of illustration that input video signal 12 is in 4 80p format.<br>
Input video signal 12 is an input to a partial frame<br>
memory 14. The partial frame memory is used to delay the<br>
video signal in time by ½ of a frame period. If fv = 6 0 Hz,<br>
the temporal frame delay is Vfv = 1/l20 second.<br>
The output signal 16 from the partial frame memory is at<br>
2fH and is delayed in time. The delayed video signal is<br>
speeded up by a 2:1 speedup memory 18. The output, signal 2 0<br>
of speedup memory 18 is both delayed and speeded up. The<br>
delayed and speeded up video signal 2 0 is an input to a<br>
multiplexer (MUX) 26.<br>
The input video signal 12 is also an input to a 2:1<br>
speedup memory 22. The speeded up output signal 24 is a<br>
second input to multiplexer 26. The memories 18 and 22 can be<br>
distinguished for reference as a memory for delayed video and<br>
a memory for real time video respectively. The output signals<br>
20 and 24 can be distinguished for reference as 4fH delayed<br>
and 4fH real time respectively.<br>
The multiplexer 26 has an output 28 coupled to a liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD) 30 that operates at 4fH. The LCD in the<br>
presently preferred embodiment is a liquid crystal on silicon<br>
(LCOS) as described earlier. The LCD 30 is capable of random<br>
row access control, that is, successive lines of video need<br>
not be written into successive rows of the LCD matrix<br>
sequentially. Moreover, in such liquid crystal displays, each<br>
cell, or pixel, remains lighted with the same intensity until<br>
the input signal is changed, thus acting as a sample and hold.<br>
The pixel does not decay.<br>
A controller 32 is a source of clock signals and control<br>
signals for the operation of the partial frame memory 14, the<br>
speedup memories 18 and 22, the multiplexer 26 and the liquid<br>
crystal display. The operation of controller 32 is<br>
constrained to provide, for example, the operating<br>
characteristics and results illustrated by the Tables in<br>
Figures 2(a), 2(b), 3, 4(a)-4g) and 5(a)-5(g).<br>
Each real time line and each delayed line supplied to the<br>
liquid crystal display must be available as an input to the<br>
multiplexer, which is the same as being available as a speeded<br>
up video line, within ½ of the frame period of the input<br>
video signal, to use a frame rate doubler as an example.<br>
However, it is not a problem if the video lines are available<br>
before ½ of the frame period has passed. Accordingly, it is<br>
not strictly necessary that the speedup factor of the real<br>
time video and the delayed video be limited to 2:1. The<br>
speedup factor can be faster if that proves convenient in the<br>
circuit design for other reasons. Moreover, it is not<br>
strictly necessary that the speedup factors for the real time<br>
video and the delayed video be the same as one another, as<br>
long as each is fast enough.<br>
The Tables in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate two<br>
different modes of operation of the circuit 10. Figure 3 is a<br>
summary of operation at a higher level that is appropriate for<br>
both Figures 2(a) and 2(b). As in Figure 1, it is assumed<br>
that memory 14 is a ½ frame memory, and the frame delay is<br>
½ of a frame period. The video speedup provided by each of<br>
memories 18 and 22 is 2:1. The input is a 480p 2fH signal.<br>
The speeded up video is at 4fH and the LCD 3 0 operates at 4fH.<br>
The 480p signal has fH = 60 Hz. The ½ frame delay in memory<br>
14 is 1/120 second.<br>
With reference to Figure 2(a), the first column<br>
represents a picture number and line number of a 480p input<br>
video signal. The row 1 entry "P1/L1" denotes picture 1, line<br>
1. The row 4 entry denotes picture 1, line 24 0. The second<br>
column represents the picture and line number of the 2fH<br>
Delayed input signal 20 to the multiplexer 26. The third<br>
column represents the picture and line number of the 2fH Real<br>
Time input signal 24 to the multiplexer 26. The fourth column<br>
represents the output of the multiplexer 26. The fifth column<br>
represents the result of writing the selected output of the<br>
multiplexer 26 into the LCD 30. The sixth column is a<br>
Sequence designation useful for reference in Figure 2(a) and<br>
keyed to Figures 3, Figures 4(b)-4(g) and Figures 5(b)-5(g).<br>
Using the Sequence designation as a reference, in the first<br>
row of Sequence B the first line of the second picture<br>
overwrites, that is replaces, the first line of the first<br>
picture.<br>
With reference to Sequence A and Figure 1, assume that<br>
line 1 of picture 1 in the input video signal propagates<br>
through speedup memory 22. At the same time, line 1 of<br>
picture 1 will propagate though the delay frame memory 14. As<br>
successive lines are received, line 241 will eventually be<br>
available to be read as the input signal 24 to the<br>
multiplexer. By that time, line 1 will have propagated<br>
through delay memory 14 and speedup memory 18, and be<br>
available to be read as the input signal 2 0 to the<br>
multiplexer. Then, line 1 can be selected for an output of<br>
the multiplexer for writing into line 1 of the LCD 30. Next,<br>
line 241 can be selected for an output of the multiplexer for<br>
writing into line 241 of the LCD 30. By the time lines 1 and<br>
241 have been written, lines 2 and 242 will be available to be<br>
read as the inputs to the multiplexer. Line 2 is written,<br>
followed by line 242; line 3 is written, followed by line 243,<br>
and so on. The picture is written in top and bottom halves<br>
simultaneously. The spatial separation of the lines being<br>
written to the display is ½ of the picture height. In other<br>
words, the separation of successively written lines of each<br>
pair of inputs available to the multiplexer is one-half of the<br>
picture height. It is of course possible for the LCD display<br>
to have more rows and/or columns of pixels than are needed to<br>
display the video signal.<br>
The sequence described above is more fully illustrated in<br>
Figure 2(a). Rows with large dots (•••••) denote rows<br>
skipped to conserve space. Rows with dashes (- - -) denote<br>
that a place is being held in the time sequence to permit both<br>
input signals to the multiplexer to be sequentially selected<br>
and written.<br>
Sequence A described how the first picture was written<br>
into the display 30. Sequences B-F illustrate how the frame<br>
doubling is actually accomplished. At the beginning of<br>
Sequence B, as shown in the first row of Sequence B, the<br>
second picture is beginning as an input to the frame rate<br>
multiplier. Picture 2, line 1 is the Real Time input to the<br>
multiplexer and picture 1, line 241 has propagated through<br>
memory 14 and is now the Delayed input to the multiplexer. As<br>
sequence B proceeds, the top half of picture 1 is replaced by<br>
the top half of picture 2 and the bottom half of picture 1 is<br>
replaced by the bottom half of picture 1.<br>
At the beginning of Sequence C, as shown in the first row<br>
of Sequence C, the bottom half of the second picture is<br>
beginning as an input to the frame rate multiplier. Picture<br>
2, line 241 is the Real Time input to the multiplexer and<br>
picture 2, line 1 has propagated through memory 14 and is now<br>
the Delayed input to the multiplexer. As sequence C proceeds,<br>
the top half of picture 2 is replaced by the top half of<br>
picture 2 and the bottom half of picture 1 is replaced by the<br>
bottom half of picture 2.<br>
At the beginning of Sequence D, as shown in the first row<br>
of Sequence D, the top half of the third picture is beginning<br>
as an input to the frame rate multiplier. Picture 3, line 1<br>
is the Real Time input to the multiplexer and picture 2, line<br>
241 has propagated through memory 14 and is now the Delayed<br>
input to the multiplexer. As sequence D proceeds, the top<br>
half of picture 2 is replaced by the top half of picture 3 and<br>
the bottom half of picture 2 is replaced by the bottom half of<br>
picture 2.<br>
Sequences E and F follow the pattern of Sequences B, C<br>
and D. The pattern of writing top and bottom halves of<br>
successive pictures is summarized in Figure 3. The column<br>
entitled New or Repeat indicates whether a given top or bottom<br>
half has been written for the first time or the second time.<br>
The right hand column are Greek letters followed by numbers<br>
that link the writing of top and bottom halves of pictures in<br>
successive sequences. It should be noted again that each<br>
sequence requires 1/2 of the frame period to complete.<br>
Accordingly, every successive pair of sequences (e.g., BC, CD,<br>
DE, etc.) requires one full frame period to complete.<br>
As a first example, al denotes the first time that the<br>
bottom half of picture 1 is written to the display. b1<br>
denotes the first time that the top half of picture 2 is<br>
written to the display. a2 denotes the second time that the<br>
bottom half of picture 2 is written to the display. b2<br>
denotes the second time that the top half of picture 2 is<br>
written to the display.<br>
As a second example, consider the sequence beginning with<br>
hl. hl denotes the first time that the bottom half of picture<br>
4 is written to the display. 91 denotes the first time that<br>
the top half of picture 5 is written to the display. h2<br>
denotes the second time that the bottom half of picture 4 is<br>
written to the display. q2 denotes the second time that the<br>
top half of picture 5 is written to the display.<br>
In each example, two top picture halves and two bottom<br>
picture halves have been written into the liquid crystal<br>
display in one frame period. The frame rate has thus been<br>
multiplied by 2.<br>
It must be remembered that the average DC level of the<br>
positive and negative polarity fields is desirably 0. At the<br>
line or row level of the display, each row is desirably driven<br>
at a 50% duty cycle with regard to field polarity. It appears<br>
that the Delayed and Real Time inputs to the multiplexer are<br>
always alternately selected as outputs. This is generally<br>
true of the inventive arrangements, and strictly true in the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 2(b), but not strictly the case in<br>
the embodiment of Figure 2(a). In fact, this is the only<br>
difference between the embodiments represented by Figures 2(a)<br>
and 2(b), and a row by row description of Figure 2(b) as with<br>
Figure 2(a) is unnecessary. Indeed, the summary of Figure 3<br>
applies to both embodiments.<br>
It can be seen in Figure 2(a) that the first row output<br>
from the multiplexer in each of the sequences is the first<br>
line of a given picture, that is, P1/L1, P2/L1, P2/L1,<br>
P3/L1, P3/L1, etc. At the beginning of Sequence B, the first<br>
output of the multiplexer is the Real Time input P2/L1. At<br>
the beginning of Sequence C, the first output of the<br>
multiplexer is the Delayed input P2/L1. But, the last output<br>
of Sequence B, namely P1/L480, was also the Delayed output.<br>
Accordingly, the alternating selection of inputs for the<br>
multiplexer is periodically interrupted in order to maintain<br>
the desirable 50% duty cycle.<br>
It can be seen in Figure 2(b) that the first row output<br>
from the multiplexer in each of the sequences is not the first<br>
line of a given picture, that is, P1/L241, P2/L1, P2/L241,<br>
P3/L1, P3/L241, etc. If the multiplexer selection always<br>
alternates, as in Figure 2(b), the following sequence of<br>
writing lines will occur for two successive pictures: 1, 241,<br>
2, 242, 3, 243, . . . 238, 478, 239, 479, 240, 48C, 241, 1,_<br>
24 2_. 2,241^ ... 478, 238, 479 , 239 _480_,__240 , 1, 241,<br>
etc. In the first part of the sequence with the single<br>
underline, there are 480 lines written before line 1 is<br>
written again. In the second part of the sequence with the<br>
double underline there are 479 lines written before line 1 is<br>
written again. This represents a small deviation from a 50%<br>
duty cycle.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 2(a) achieves the 50% duty cycle<br>
but requires a more complex operation of the multiplexer. The<br>
embodiment of Figure 2(b) departs somewhat from the 50% duty<br>
cycle, but if the liquid crystal display can tolerate the<br>
deviation, the operation of the frame rate multiplier is less<br>
complex.<br>
Electrical field polarity can be managed in accordance<br>
with the inventive arrangements. A first scheme for managing<br>
field polarity is shown in Figures 4(a)-(g). A second scheme<br>
for managing field polarity is shown in Figures 5(a)-(g).<br>
Each of these representative schemes can be used with the<br>
embodiment of Figure 1, operated in accordance with Figure<br>
2(a) or 2(b), as well as the further embodiments shown in<br>
Figures 6, 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 4(a) is a key for understanding Figures 4(b) -(g).<br>
A white background 40 represents a liquid crystal display with<br>
a positive field polarity and a gray background 42 represents<br>
a liquid crystal display with a negative field polarity. A<br>
liquid crystal display 44 in Figure 4(b) has a top half 46 and<br>
a bottom half 48. During Sequence B, for example, the display<br>
44 is driven by a negative polarity field in each of the top<br>
and bottom halves. The driving field polarity reverses to<br>
positive at the beginning of Sequence C as shown in Figure<br>
4(c). The driving field polarity reverses to negative at the<br>
beginning of Sequence D as shown in Figure 4(d). The driving<br>
field polarity reverses to positive at the beginning of<br>
Sequence E as shown in Figure 4(e). The field polarity<br>
continues to alternate as shown in Figures 4(f) and 4(g).<br>
This embodiment can be implemented, for example, by changing<br>
the driving field polarity every time the multiplexer supplies<br>
the number of lines constituting a full picture height, in<br>
this example, every 480 lines. In other words, before writing<br>
the first line of each sequence.<br>
Figure 5(a) is a key for understanding Figures 5(b) -(g).<br>
A liquid crystal display 50 has a top half 52 and a bottom<br>
half 54. One of the top and bottom halves is always written<br>
with a positive electric field while the other one of the top<br>
and bottom halves is always written with a negative electric<br>
field. Further, each of the top and bottom halves is<br>
successively and completely written with alternating polarity<br>
electric fields. A white background represents a liquid<br>
crystal display with a positive field polarity and a gray<br>
background represents a liquid crystal display with a negative<br>
field polarity. A liquid crystal display 56 in Figure 5(b)<br>
has a top half 58 and a bottom half 60. During Sequence B,<br>
for example, the display 56 is driven by a negative polarity<br>
field in the top half 58 and a positive polarity field in the<br>
bottom half 60. The driving field polarity for each of the<br>
top and bottom halves reverses at the beginning of Sequence C<br>
as shown in Figure 5(c). The driving field polarity for each<br>
of the top and bottom halves reverses again at the beginning<br>
of Sequence D as shown in Figure 5(d). The driving field<br>
polarity for each of the top and bottom halves continues to<br>
reverse as shown in Figures 5(e), 5(f) and 5(g). This scheme<br>
requires that the driving field polarity for each line<br>
reverses with each output line of the multiplexer.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment. Frame<br>
rate multiplier 100, embodied as a frame rate doubler, is<br>
identical to the frame rate multiplier 10 in Figure 1 except<br>
that the partial frame 14 and the speedup memory 18 are<br>
replaced by a single frame memory 114. Memory 114 provides<br>
both the partial frame delay and the video speedup. This<br>
embodiment requires one less speedup memory, but there is no<br>
reduction in the memory bandwidth, as the half-frame memory<br>
must be read a faster rate (e.g., 4fH) than the rate of the<br>
incoming video signal (e.g., 2fH). In all other respects, the<br>
operation of this embodiment is the same as that shown in<br>
Figure 1. The embodiment of Figure 6 can be operated, for<br>
example, as explained in Figures 2(a) , 2(b), 3, 4(a)-(g) and<br>
5(a)-(g) .<br>
Figure 7 illustrates another alternative embodiment.<br>
Frame rate multiplier 150, embodied as a frame rate doubler,<br>
is identical to the frame rate multiplier 10 in Figure 1<br>
except that the partial frame memory 14, the speedup memory 18<br>
and the speedup memory 22 are replaced by a single: memory 154 .<br>
Memory 154 provides both the partial frame delay and the video<br>
speedup for both the delayed and real time versions of the<br>
input video signal 12. It is necessary that the read port be<br>
selectively addressable in order that real time video lines<br>
and the delayed video lines can be read alternately, speeded<br>
up and then supplied to the liquid crystal display in<br>
accordance with the methods taught herein. All of the data<br>
manipulations result from controlling the read port of the<br>
memory 154, which is reflected in the corresponding operation<br>
of the controller 32. This embodiment requires only one<br>
memory that functions as both of the speedup memories and the<br>
delay memory. As in the embodiment of Figure 6, there is no<br>
reduction in the memory bandwidth, as the half-frame memory<br>
must be read a faster rate (e.g., 4fH) than the rate of the<br>
incoming video signal (e.g., 2fH) . Moreover, it is expected<br>
that the half-frame memory must be somewhat larger than one-<br>
half of a frame, for example in the range of one-half of a<br>
line to several lines, particularly to operate in accordance<br>
with the embodiment represented by Figure 2(a). Accordingly,<br>
the size of half-frame memory 154 is approximately (@) one-<br>
half of a frame. With regard to the advantage of embodying<br>
the memory in an integrated circuit, the extra lines needed<br>
are of no practical consequence. In this respect, the memory<br>
154 is still fairly referred to in general as a half-frame<br>
memory. In all other respects, the operation of this<br>
embodiment is the same as that shown in Figure 1. The<br>
embodiment of Figure 6 can be operated, for example, as<br>
explained in Figures 2(a), 2(b), 3, 4(a)-(g) and 5(a)-(g).<br>
Frame rate multiplier 200 shown in Figure 8 illustrates<br>
how the frame rate multiplier is adapted for operation when<br>
n &gt; 2. A partial frame memory 214 has multiple output taps<br>
216A, 216B, 216C, etc., providing equal delays. An array 218<br>
of n-1 speedup memories includes speedup memories 218A, 218B,<br>
218C, etc. An n:l speedup memory is provided for each delayed<br>
output of memory 214. Each speedup memory provides an output<br>
220A, 220B, 220C, etc., which is a selectable input for the<br>
multiplexer 226. The operation of the Real Time speedup<br>
memory 22,with output 24 is the same. There are n-1 speedup<br>
memories in the array 218, and there are n speedup memories in<br>
the circuit 200. Whether or not the Real Time speedup memory<br>
is or is not considered a part of the array 218 is a matter of<br>
convenience.<br>
The operation of the liquid crystal display is altered<br>
insofar as the picture will be written into the display as n<br>
parts. If n = 3, for example, the picture will be divided<br>
into and processed as top, middle and bottom thirds. Each<br>
third would have 160 lines. The output taps of the frame<br>
memory would be timed for ? of frame period and ? of a<br>
frame period. The writing sequence by line for n = 3 for a<br>
480p video signal can be, for example, 1, 161, 321, 2, 162,<br>
322, 3, 163, 323, etc. If n = 4, for example, the picture<br>
will be divided into and processed as top, upper middle, lower<br>
middle and bottom fourths. Each fourth would have 120 lines.<br>
The output taps of the frame memory would be timed for 1/4 of<br>
frame period, ½ of frame period and ¾ of a frame period.<br>
The writing sequence by line for n = 4 for a 480p video signal<br>
can be, for example, 1, 121, 241, 361, 2, 122, 242, 362, 3,<br>
123, 243, 363, etc. The further detailed operation of this<br>
embodiment is very tedious to illustrate and explain as was<br>
done in Figures 2(a), 2(b) and 3. However, those skilled in<br>
the art will encounter no difficulties in scaling up the size<br>
and capacity of the frame rate multiplier 200 based upon the<br>
teachings of the preceding embodiments. It can be noted, for<br>
example, that when n = 3 the size of the delay memory must be<br>
? of a frame memory. When n = 4 the size of the delay<br>
memory must be 3/4 of a frame memory. Therefore,, the trade-<br>
off for higher frame multiplication rates is the need for a<br>
larger frame memory, as well as a more complex set of clock<br>
and control signals generated by controller 232. In view of<br>
the foregoing teachings, it can be understood by one skilled<br>
in the art that under some circumstances, for example when<br>
1 
written more than once. It should be noted that all of the<br>
operations implemented by frame rate multiplier 200 can be<br>
implemented by a frame rate multiplier with a single memory as<br>
shown in Figure 7. Accordingly, the Tables in Figures 9 (a) -<br>
(c) are appropriate for both Figures 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 9(a) is a Table illustrating the frame period of<br>
the speeded up video signals for n = 2, 3 or 4 when fVin is 50<br>
Hz or 60 Hz. Figure 9(b) is a Table illustrating the<br>
horizontal scanning frequency nfHin of the speeded up video<br>
signals for n = 2, 3 or 4 when fHin is fH, 2fH and 3fH.<br>
Figure 9(c) is a Table summarizing the operating<br>
parameters and structure of frame rate multiplier for n = 2, 3<br>
and 4. When n = 2, the size of the memory 214 is ½ of a<br>
frame, there are 2 speedup memories and the outputs must be<br>
delayed by ½ of a frame relative to one another, as in<br>
Figure 1. When n = 3, the size of the memory 214 is ? of a<br>
frame, there are 2 speedup memories in the array 218, 3<br>
speedup memories altogether, and the outputs must be delayed<br>
by ? of a frame period relative to one another. When n = 4,<br>
the size of the memory 214 is 3/4 of a frame, there are 3<br>
speedup memories in the array 218, 4 speedup memories<br>
altogether and the outputs must be delayed by ¼ of a frame<br>
period relative to one another.<br>
It can now be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that the methods taught herein are generally applicable to all<br>
frame rate multipliers where the multiplication factor n &gt; 1.<br>
A multiplication factor of n = 1.5, for example, can represent<br>
a situation where a 50 Hz frame rate input signal can<br>
advantageously be frame rate multiplied to 75 Hz to avoid<br>
flicker. However, it can also now be appreciated that<br>
hardware implementations of the methods taught herein are<br>
advantageously easier when n = 2, and more particularly, when<br>
n is also an integer.<br>
