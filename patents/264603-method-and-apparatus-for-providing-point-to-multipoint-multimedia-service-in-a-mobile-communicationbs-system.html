[DESCRIPTION]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communications system and, more<br>
particularly, to a method and apparatus for providing at least one mobile communication<br>
terminal, or user equipment (UE), with a point-to-multipoint multimedia service through<br>
two or more common physical channels in a mobile communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a network structure of a universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (UMTS). Referring to FIG. 1, the universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (hereinafter, referred to as 'UMTS') includes a user<br>
equipment 1 (hereinafter, referred to as 'UE'), a UMTS terrestrial radio access network<br>
2 (hereinafter, referred to as 'UTRAN') and a core network 3 (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
'CN'). The UTRAN 2 includes at least one radio network sub-system 4 (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'RNS') and each RNS includes a radio network controller 5 (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'RNC') and at least one base station 6 (hereinafter, referred to as 'Node<br>
B') managed by the RNC. The Node B 6 includes at least one cell.<br>
FIG. 2 is an architectural diagram of a radio interface protocol between a UE 1<br>
and UTRAN 2 based on the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) radio access<br><br>
network specifications. Referring to FIG. 2, the radio interface protocol horizontally<br>
includes a physical layer, a data link layer and a network layer and the radio interface<br>
protocol vertically includes a user plane for data information transfer and a control<br>
plane for signaling transfer. The protocol layers in FIG. 2 can be divided into LI (first<br>
layer), L2 (second layer), and L3 (third layer) based on lower three layers of the open<br>
system interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in the communications<br>
systems.<br>
The physical layer as the first layer provides an information transfer service to<br>
an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer is connected to a medium<br>
access control (MAC) layer above the physical layer via transport channels through<br>
which data are transferred between the medium access control layer and the physical<br>
layer. Data is transmitted between different physical layers, and more particularly,<br>
between the physical layer of a transmitting side and the physical layer of a receiving<br>
side via physical channels.<br>
The medium access control (MAC) layer of the second layer provides services to<br>
a radio link control (hereinafter abbreviated RLC) layer above the MAC layer via<br>
logical channels. The RLC layer of the second layer supports reliable data transfer and<br>
is operative in segmentation and concatenation of RLC service data units (SDUs) sent<br>
down from an upper layer.<br>
A radio resource control (RRC) layer located on the lowest part of the third layer<br>
is defined in the control plane only and controls the logical channels, the transport<br>
channels, and the physical channels with configuration, reconfiguration, and release of<br><br>
radio bearers (RBs). An RB is a service offered by the second layer for the data transfer<br>
between the UE 1 and the UTRAN 2. Generally, configuring an RB refers to defining<br>
the characteristics of protocol layers and channels necessary for providing a specific<br>
service and is to establish respective specific parameters and operational methods for<br>
them.<br>
A multimedia broadcast/multicast service (hereinafter, referred to as 'MBMS')<br>
offers a streaming or background service to a plurality of UEs 1 using a downlink<br>
dedicated MBMS bearer service. An MBMS is provided during one session, and data<br>
for the MBMS is transmitted to the plurality of UEs 1 via ihe MBMS bearer service<br>
during an ongoing session only. A UE 1 performs activation first for receiving the<br>
MBMS to which the UE has subscribed and receives the activated services only.<br>
The UTRAN 2 provides the MBMS bearer service to at least one UE 1 using<br>
radio bearers. The radio bearers (RBs) used by the UTRAN 2 include a point-to-point<br>
radio bearer and a point-to-multipoint radio bearer.<br>
The point-to-point radio bearer is a bi-directional radio bearer and is configured<br>
by a logical channel DTCH (dedicated traffic channel), a transport channel DCH<br>
(dedicated channel), and a physical channel DPCH (dedicated physical channel) or a<br>
physical channel SCCPCH (secondary common control physical channel). The point-<br>
to-multipoint radio bearer is a unidirectional downlink radio bearer and is configured by<br>
a logical channel MTCH (MBMS traffic channel), a transport channel FACH (forward<br>
access channel), and a physical channel SCPCH. The logical channel MTCH is<br><br>
configured for each MBMS offered to one cell and is used for transmitting user-plane<br>
data of a specific MBMS to a plurality of UEs.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, a logical channel MCCH (MBMS control channel) in a<br>
conventional system is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel used in transmitting<br>
control information associated with the MBMS. The logical channel MCCH is mapped<br>
to the transport channel FACH (forward access channel), while the transport channel<br>
FACH is mapped to the physical channel SCCPCH (secondary common control<br>
physical channel). A cell has only one MCCH.<br>
The UTRAN 2 providing MBMS services transmits MCCH information through<br>
the MCCH channel to at least one UE 1. The MCCH information includes notification<br>
messages, specifically RRC messages related to the MBMS. For example, the MCCH<br>
information may include messages indicating MBMS service information, messages<br>
indicating point-to-multipoint radio bearer information or access information indicating<br>
that RRC connection for the MBMS is needed.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating how MCCH information is transmitted in a<br>
conventional method. FIG. 5 illustrates a conventional method for providing an MBMS.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, the UTRAN 2 providing an MBMS service transmits the<br>
MCCH information to a plurality of UEs 1 via the MCCH channel. The MCCH<br>
information is periodically transmitted according to a modification period and a<br>
repetition period.<br>
The MCCH information is categorized into critical information and non-critical<br>
information.   The non-critical information can be freely modified each modification<br><br>
period or each repetition period.  However, the critical information can be modified<br>
only each modification period.<br>
Specifically, the critical information is repeated one time each repetition period.<br>
However, the modified critical information can be transmitted only at a start point of the<br>
modification period.<br>
The UTRAN 2 periodically transmits a physical channel MICH (MBMS<br>
notification indicator channel) to indicate whether the MCCH information is updated<br>
during the modification period. Therefore, a UE 1 attempting to receive only a specific<br>
MBMS does not receive the MCCH or MTCH until a session of the service begins but<br>
receives the MICH (MBMS notification indicator channel) periodically. The update of<br>
the MCCH information refers to a generation, addition, modification or removal of a<br>
specific item of the MCCH information.<br>
Once a session of a specific MBMS begins, the UTRAN 2 transmits an NI<br>
(notification indicator) through a MICH. The NI is an indication to a UE 1 attempting<br>
to receive the specific MBMS that it is to receive an MCCH channel. The UE 1, having<br>
received the NI via the MICH, receives an MCCH during a specific modification period<br>
indicated by the MICH.<br>
The MCCH information is control information, specifically RRC messages,<br>
associated with an MBMS. The MCCH information includes MBMS modification<br>
service information, MBMS non-modification service information, MBMS point-to-<br>
multipoint RB information and access information.<br><br>
A UE 1 attempting to receive a specific MBMS using a point-to-multipoint radio<br>
bearer receives MCCH information including radio bearer information via an MCCH<br>
and then configures the point-to-multipoint radio bearer using the received information.<br>
After configuring the point-to-multipoint radio bearer, the UE 1 keeps receiving a<br>
physical channel SCCPCH, to which an MTCH is mapped, in order to acquire data of<br>
the specific MBMS transmitted via the MTCH.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 6, a UTRAN 2 in a conventional system may transmit<br>
MBMS data discontinuously via the MTCH. In doing so, the UTRAN 2 periodically<br>
transmits a scheduling message to UEs 1 via an MSCH, specifically a SCCPCH<br>
carrying MTCH, to which an MTCH is mapped. The scheduling message indicates a<br>
transmission start timing point and transmission period of MBMS data transmitted<br>
during one scheduling period. The UTRAN 2 should previously inform the UE of a<br>
transmission period, specifically a scheduling period, of scheduling information.<br>
The UE 1 obtains the scheduling period from the UTRAN 2 and then receives<br>
scheduling messages according to the scheduling period periodically. The UE 1<br>
receives a SCCPCH carrying a MTCH discontinuously and periodically using the<br>
received scheduling messages. Specifically, according to the scheduling messages, the<br>
UE 1 receives the SCCPCH carrying the MTCH during times for which data is<br>
transmitted but does not receive the SCCPCH carrying the MTCH during times for<br>
which data is not transmitted. Using the above-described scheme, the UE 1 can receive<br>
data efficiently so that battery consumption may be diminished.<br><br>
In the conventional method described above, a WCDMA system using a FDD<br>
(Time Division Duplex) mode transmits the SCCPCH using a channel code. This<br>
results in restricting the maximum transmission speed of an MBMS transmitted through<br>
the SCCPCH below 256 kbps, which is the maximum speed of the SCCPCH.<br>
Therefore, a disadvantage of the conventional method is that an MBMS service<br>
exceeding 256 kbps cannot be provided<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus and method that facilitates providing<br>
an MBMS service exceeding 256 kbps. The present invention addresses this and other<br>
needs.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing at least<br>
one user equipment (UE) with a point-to-multipoint multimedia service at a higher<br>
speed through two or more common physical channels in a mobile communications<br>
system. Although the present invention is illustrated with respect to a mobile<br>
communication terminal, it is contemplated that the present invention may be utilized<br>
anytime it is desired to provide a point-to-multipoint multimedia service to any device<br>
in a mobile communications system.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or like parts.<br>
FIG 7 illustrates a method according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The embodiment of FIG 7 is an example in which the technical features of<br>
the present invention are applied to a multimedia broadcast or multicast service<br>
(MBMS) in a UMTS system having the structure depicted in FIG 1, for example, when<br>
a UE 1 transmits and receives data in a FDD mode of WCDMA.<br>
As illustrated in FIG 7, a UTRAN 2 transmits an MBMS transmission identifier<br>
of an MBMS via an MBMS service information message through an MCCH to a UE 1<br>
(S10). The UE 1, intending to receive the MBMS after receiving the MBMS service<br>
information message, receives MBMS point-to-multipoint radio bearer (RB)<br>
information from the UTRAN (S12).<br><br>
The UTRAN 2 informs the UE via the MBMS point-to-multipoint RB<br>
information of multi channel code information for configuring multi-code physical<br>
channels through which the MBMS is transmitted. The multi channel code information<br>
includes code information allocated to at least two physical channels (SCCPCH)<br>
through which the MBMS is transmitted.<br>
The UE 1 checks whether it has the capacity to receive the MBMS using the<br>
multi channels. If the UE is able to receive the MBMS, an RRC layer of the UE 1<br>
configures two or more physical channels using the received multi channel code<br>
information (S14).<br>
The UE 1 receives physical channels carrying MTCH data using the multi-code<br>
(S16). When the UE 1 receives radio bearer information of neighbor cells, it may<br>
receive data by combining physical channels transmitted from two or more cells.<br>
FIG 8 is a diagram illustrating the structure of a physical channel related to<br>
multi code SCCPCH channels in a UE 1 according to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. When an MTCH is mapped to a FACH to be transmitted, the<br>
physical layer of the UTRA 2 divides and transmits the MBMS data of at least one<br>
EACH mapped to a coded composite transport channel (CCTrCH) through two or more<br>
code physical channels configured using the multi channel code information. The UE 1<br>
obtains transmit format combination indicator (TFCI) information through a physical<br>
channel from the multiplexed two or more physical channels and receives the two or<br>
more physical channels using the TFCI information.<br><br>
The UE 1, which has received the two or more physical channels for the<br>
CCTrCH, combines, decodes, and multiplexes the received data and then transmits the<br>
result to the corresponding FACHs. MTCH data can be transmitted and received<br>
through two or more physical channels.<br>
FIGS. 9A and 9B are diagrams illustrating a multi-code transmission scheme<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. FIG 9A illustrates an<br>
example where the TFCI and pilot signals are transmitted with the MBMS data in one<br>
slot FIG 9B illustrates an example where the TFCI and the MBMS data are transmitted.<br>
FIGS. 9A and 9B are diagrams illustrating a structure for one slot. The same structure<br>
can be applicable to every slot of the SCCPCH.<br>
When control information for physical channels, such as the TFCI or the pilot<br>
signals, is transmitted together with the MBMS data, the control information is<br>
transmitted through one physical channel alone. The MBMS data is transmitted through<br>
the multiple physical channels.<br>
The above-described embodiments are illustrated for a 3GPP mobile<br>
communications system. However, it will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in<br>
the art that the present invention is also applicable to a wireless communications system<br>
for a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a personal computer (PC) within which a<br>
mobile communication interface is installed.<br>
Furthermore, the scope of the present invention should not be interpreted within<br>
the scope of a UTMS system. The present invention may be applied to other mobile<br><br>
communications systems using other air interfaces and physical channels, for example,<br>
TDMA, CDMA, or FDMA.<br>
The present invention can be implemented in software, firmware, hardware or a<br>
combination thereof. Specifically, the present invention can be implemented using<br>
hardware logic such as codes, circuit chips or ASIC, or by using a computer program<br>
language in a computer-readable storage medium, such as a hard disk, floppy disk, tape,<br>
optical storage medium, ROM or RAM.<br>
The code stored in the computer-readable storage medium can be accessed and<br>
processed by a processor through a transmission medium or a file server on a network.<br>
The apparatus storing the code includes a wire transmission medium, such as a network<br>
transmission line, a wireless transmission medium, signal transmission, wireless signals,<br>
and infrared ray signals.<br>
FIG 10 illustrates a block diagram of a mobile communication device 100 for<br>
performing the functions of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The<br>
mobile communication device 100 includes a processing unit module 110, such as a<br>
microprocessor or a digital processor, an RF module 135, a power control module 105,<br>
an antenna 140, a battery 155, a display module 115, a keypad 120, a storage module<br>
130, such as a ROM, a SRAM, or flash memory, a speaker 145 and a microphone 150.<br>
A user inputs command information, such as phone numbers, using the keypad<br>
120 or uses voice activation using the microphone 145. The processing unit module 110<br>
receives and processes the command information to perform the function requested by<br>
the user. In order to perform the function, the processing unit module 110 retrieves and<br><br>
uses data stored in the storage module 130 and displays the command information and<br>
the retrieved data on the display module 115 for the user's convenience.<br>
The processing unit module 110 instructs the RF module 135 to transmit radio<br>
signals including voice data. The RF module 135 includes a transceiver and a receiver<br>
for transmitting and receiving the radio signals and the radio signals are transmitted and<br>
received through the antenna 140. When receiving the radio signals, the RF module 135<br>
converts the radio signals into base band frequency signals such that the processing unit<br>
module 110 may process the base band frequency signals. The processed signals can be<br>
delivered to the user through the speaker 145 or in a form of readable information.<br>
The RF module 135 receives data from a network or transmits information<br>
measured or generated by the mobile communication device 100 to the network. The<br>
storage module 130 stores information measured or generated by the mobile<br>
communication device 100. The processing unit module 110 processes the received<br>
data or data to be transmitted as well as performing the methods of the present invention<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
