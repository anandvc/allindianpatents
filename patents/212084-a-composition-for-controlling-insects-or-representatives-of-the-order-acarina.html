				<td>The present invention relates to a composition which comprises a pesticidal active compound combination, a method for controlling pests with this composition, a process for the preparation of the composition, its use and plant propagation material treated with it, and the use of a compound of the following formula (A) for the preparation of the composition.<br>
Certain mixtures of active compounds are proposed for pest control in the literature. However, the biological properties of these mixtures of known compounds are not completely satisfactory in the field of pest control, and for this reason there is a need to provide further mixtures having synergistic pest control properties, in particular for control of insects and representatives of the order Acarina. This object is achieved according to the invention by providing the present composition.<br>
The invention accordingly relates to a composition for controlling insects and representatives of the order Acarina, which comprises a combination of variable amounts of one or more compounds of the formula<br><br>

The compounds of the formula (A) can in some cases be in the form of tautomers. For example, if R is hydrogen, corresponding compounds of the formula (A), i.e. those having a 3-H-4-imino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine partial structure, can be in equilibrium with the particular tautomers which contain a 4-amino-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine partial structure. Compounds of the formula (A) above and below are accordingly also to be un- derstood as meaning, where appropriate, corresponding tautomers, even if the latter are not mentioned specifically in each case.<br>
Compounds of the formula (A) which contain at least one basic centre can form, for example, acid addition salts. These are formed, for example, with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, for example perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, nitrous acid, a phosphoric acid or a hydrogen halide acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as C1-C4alkanecarboxylic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, for example acetic acid, such as dicarboxylic acids which are saturated or unsaturated, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric or phthalic acid, such as hydroxycar-boxylic acids, for example ascorbic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, or such as benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as C1-C4alkane- or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, for example methane- or p-toluenesulfonic acid. Compounds of the formula (A) with at least one acid group can furthermore form salts with bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl-, diethyl-, triethyl- or di-methyl-propyl-amine, or a mono- di- or trihydroxy-lower alkylamine, for example mono-, di-or triethanolamine. If appropriate, corresponding inner salts can furthermore be formed. Agrochemically advantageous salts are preferred in the context of the invention. As a result of the close relationship between the compounds of the formula (A) in the free form and in the form of their salts, the free compounds of the formula (A) and their salts above and below are also appropriately and expediently to be understood as meaning, where appropriate, the corresponding salts and the free compounds of the formula (A). The same applies correspondingly to tautomers of compounds of the formula (A) and salts thereof. In each case the free form is in general preferred.<br>

are<br>

(A.7) (2-chloropyrid-5-ylmethyl)-4-nitroimino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine;<br>
(A.8) (2-chlorothiazol-5-ylmethyl)-4-nitroimino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine, or<br>
(A.9) (2-chloropyrid-5-ylmethyl)-3-ethyl-4-nitroimino-peitiydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine.<br>
5-(2-chlorothiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-4-nitroimino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine is especially preferred in the context of the invention as the mixing partner of the formula (A). A composition which, in addition to the compound of the formula (A), also comprises only one further compound (I) to (CLXXXIV) having a pesticidal action is also preferred. Compositions which comprise pirimicarb in addition to a compound of the formula (A) are furthermore preferred. Compositions which comprise pyriproxyfen, fipronil, endosulfan or buprofezin in addition to a compound of the formula (A) are likewise preferred.<br>
The active compound combination according to the invention preferably comprises the active compound of the formula (A) and one of the active compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) in a mixing ratio of 100:1 to 1:6000, in particular 1:50 to 50:1, in particular in a ratio of between 1:20 and 20:1, in particular between 10:1 and 1:10, especially between 5:1 and 1:5, particularly preferably between 2:1 and 1:2, and also preferably between 4:1 and 2:1, especially in the ratio of 1:1, or 5:1, or 5:2, or 5:3, or 5:4, or 4:1, or 4:2, or 4:3, or 3:1, or 3:2, or 2:1, or 1:5, or 2:5, or 3:5, or 4:5, or 1:4, or 2:4, or 3:4, or 1:3, or 2:3, or 1:2, or, 1:600, or 1:300, or 1:150, or 1:35, or 2:35, or 4:35, or 1:75, or 2:75, or 4:75, or 1:6000, or 1:3000, or 1:1500, or 1:350, or 2:350, or 4:350, or 1:750, or 2:750, or 4:750. These ratios are understood as meaning weight ratios on the one hand, and also molar ratios on the other hand.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the combination of the active compound of the formula (A) or of one of its salts with one of the active compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) not only causes an additive increase in the action spectrum on the pests to be controlled, which is to be expected in principle, but that it achieves a synergistic effect which extends the action limits of both preparations under two aspects:<br>
On the one hand, the rates of application of the compound of the formula (A) and of the individual compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) are lowered for the same good action. On the other hand, the combined mixture also still has a high degree of pest control where the two individual substances have become completely inactive in the range of excessively low rates of application. This allows on the one hand a considerable extension to the spectrum of pests which can be controlled and on the other hand an increase in application reliability.<br>
In addition to the actual synergistic action in respect of pesticidal activity, however, the compositions according to the invention also additionally have further surprising advantages which can likewise be described as synergistic in a broadened sense: thus, for example, it is possible to control pests which cannot be controlled or sufficiently effectively controlled with the individual compounds(A) or (I) to (CLXXXIV), and the compositions according to the invention show a better toleration by plants, i.e., for example, a reduced phyto-toxicity, than the individual compounds (A) and (I) to (CLXXXIV). The insects can furthermore be controlled in their various stages of development, which sometimes is not the case with the individual compounds (A) and (I) to (CLXXXIV), since these compounds can be used, for example, only as adulticides or only as larvicides against quite specific larval stages. In addition, combinations of the compound (A) with certain compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) show more favourable properties during grinding, mixing, storage and also spraying.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are valuable preventively and/or curatively even at low rates of concentration in the field of pest control, while being tolerated by warmblooded animals, fishes and plants, and have a very favourable biocidal spectrum. The compositions according to the invention are active against all or individual stages of development of normally sensitive and also resistant animal pests, such as insects and representatives of the order Acarina. The insecticidal and/or acaricidal action of the compositions according to the invention can manifest itself here directly, i.e. in a destruction of the pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during moulting, or indirectly, for example in a reduced oviposition and/or hatching rate, the good action corresponding to a rate of destruction (mortality) of at least 50 to 60%.<br>

The pesticidal mixture according to the invention can advantageously be employed for pest control in cereals, such as maize or sorghum; in fruit, for example pome, stone and soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries or berries, for example strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; in leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils, peas or soya; in oil-bearing crops, such as oilseed rape, mustard, poppy seed, olives, sunflower, coconut, castor, cacao or groundnuts; in gourds, such as pumpkins, cucumbers or melons; in fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; in citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; in vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbage varieties, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes or capsicum; in lauraceous plants, such as avocado, cinnamonium, camphor; or in tobacco, nuts, coffee, aubergines, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, musaceous plants, natural rubber plants or ornamentals, in particular in maize, sorghum, pome and stone fruits, leguminous plants, cucurbits, cotton, citrus fruits, vegetables, aubergines, vines, hops or ornamentals, especially in maize, sorghum, apples, pears, plums, peaches, beans, peas, soya, olives, sunflower, coconut, cacao, groundnuts, cucumbers, pumpkins, citrus fruits, cabbage varieties, tomatoes, potatoes, vines or cotton, particularly preferably in vines, citrus fruits, apples, pears, tomatoes and cotton.<br>
Other fields of use of the active compound mixtures according to the invention are protection of stored products and stocks and of material, and in the hygiene sector, in particular the protection of domestic animals and productive livestock against pests of the type mentioned.<br>
Depending on the aims to be achieved and the given circumstances, the pesticides according to the invention are emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, directly spra-yable or dilutable solutions, spreadable pastes, dilute emulsions, sprayable powders, soluble powders, dispersible powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules or encapsulations in polymeric substances which comprise the compound of the formula (A) or one of its salts and one of the other active compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds are employed in these compositions in a pure form, the solid active compounds, for example, being employed in a specific particle size, or, preferably, together with - at least - one of the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, such as extenders, for example solvents or solid carriers, or such as surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Solvents are, for example: non-hydrogenated or partly hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably fractions C8 to C12 of alkylbenzenes, such as xylene mixtures, alkylated naphthalenes or tetrahydronaphthalene, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as paraffins or cyclohexane, alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and ethers and esters thereof, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol or ethylene glycol monomethyl or -ethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolid-2-one, dimethyl sulfoxi-de or N,N-dimethylformamide, water, non-epoxidized or epoxidized plant oils, such as non-epoxidized or epoxidized rapeseed, castor, coconut or soya oil, and silicone oils.<br>
Solid carriers, for example for dusts and dispersible powders, which are as a rule used are natural rock powders, such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. Highly disperse silicic acids or highly disperse absorbent polymers can also be added to improve the physical properties. Granular, adsorptive granule carriers are porous types, such as pumice, crushed brick, sepiolite or bentonite, and non-adsorptive carrier materials are calcite or sand. A large number of granulated materials of inorganic or organic nature, in particular dolomite or comminuted plant residues, can furthermore be used.<br>
Surface-active compounds are, depending on the nature of the active compound to be formulated, nonionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants or surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The surfactants listed below are to be regarded only as examples here; many other surfactants which are conventionally used in the art of formulation and are suitable according to the invention are described in the relevant literature.<br>
Nonionic surfactants are, in particular, polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, which can contain 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon radical and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical of the alkylphenols. Water-soluble adducts, containing 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups, of polyethylene oxide on polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol and alkylpolypropylene glycol having 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain are furthermore suitable. The compounds mentioned usually comprise 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Examples are nonylphenol-polyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ether, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypoly-ethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene-sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene-sorbitan trioleate, are furthermore possible.<br>
Cationic surfactants are, in particular, quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as sub-stituents, at least one alkyl radical having 8 to 22 C atoms and, as further substituents, lower, non-halogenated or halogenated alkyl, benzyl or lower hydroxy alkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methyl-sulfates or ethyl-sulfates. Examples are ste-aryltrimethylammonium chloride and benzyldi(2-chloroethyl)ethylammonium bromide.<br>
Suitable inorganic surfactants can be both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds. Suitable soaps are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and substituted and unsubstituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22), such as the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of naturally occurring fatty acid mixtures, which can be obtained, for example, from coconut oil or tall oil; and furthermore also the fatty acid methyl-taurine salts. However, synthetic surfactants are more frequently used, in particular fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alky-larylsulfonates. The fatty sulfonates and sulfates are as a rule in the form of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts, and in general contain an alkyl radical having 8 to 22 C atoms, alkyl also including the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals; examples are the sodium or calcium salt of ligninsulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfuric acid ester or of a fatty alcohol sulfate mixture prepared from naturally occurring fatty acids. These also include the salts of sulfuric acid esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol-ethylene oxide ad-ducts. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain two sulfonic acid groups and one fatty acid radical having about 8 to 22 C atoms. Alkylarylsulfonates are, for example, the sodium, calcium or triethanolammonium salts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, of dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid-formaldehyde condensati- on product. Corresponding phosphates, such as salts of the phosphoric acid ester of a p-nonylphenol-(4-14)-ethylene oxide adduct or phospholipids, are furthermore also suitable.<br>
The compositions as a rule comprise 0.1 to 99%, in particular 0.1 to 95%, of a mixture of the active compound of the formula (A) with one of the active compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV), and 1 to 99.9%, in particular 5 to 99.9%, of - at least - one solid or liquid auxiliary, where as a rule 0 to 25%, in particular 0.1 to 20%, of the compositions can be surfactants (% is in each case per cent by weight). While concentrated compositions are rather preferred as commercial goods, the end user as a rule uses dilute compositions which have considerably lower active compound concentrations. Preferred compositions have, in particular, the following composition (% = per cent by weight):<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates:<br>
Active compound mixture	1 to 90%, preferably 5 to 20%<br>
Surfactant:-	1 to 30%, preferably 10 to20 %<br>
Solvent:	5 to 98%, preferably 70 to 85%<br>
Dusts:<br>
Active compound mixture:	0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 1%<br>
Solid carrier:"	99.9 to 90%, preferably 99.9 to 99%<br>
Suspension concentrates:<br>
Active compound mixture:	5 to 75%, preferably 10 to 50%<br>
Water:	94 to 24%, preferably 88 to 30%<br>
Surfactant:	1 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%<br>
Wettable powders:<br>
Active compound mixture:	0.5 to 90%, preferably 1 to 80%<br>
Surfactant:	0.5 to 20%, preferably 1 to 15%<br>
Solid carrier:	5 to 99%, preferably 15 to 98%<br>
Granules:<br>
Active compound mixture:	0.5 to 30%, preferably 3 to 15%<br>
Solid carrier:	99.5 to 70%, preferably 97 to 85%<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also comprise other solid or liquid auxiliaries, such as, stabilizers, for example non-epoxidized or epoxidized plant oils (for example epoxidized coconut oil, rape oil or soya oil), defoamers, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and/or tackifiers, as well as fertilizers or other active compounds for-achieving specific effects, for example bactericides, fungicides, nematicides, mollusicides or herbicides.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are prepared in a known manner, in the absence of auxiliaries, for example, by grinding, sieving and/or pressing a solid active compound or active compound mixture, for example to a particular particle size, and in the presence of at least one auxiliary, for example, by intimate mixing and/or grinding of the active compound or active compound mixture with the auxiliary or auxilaries. The invention therefore also relates to the process for the preparation of the compositions.<br>
Mixtures of a compound of the formula (A) with one or more of the compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) are preferably employed with the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, and are therefore processed, for example, to emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts and granules, and also to encapsulations in, for example, polymeric substances, in a known manner. The methods of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, wetting, scattering or pouring are chosen, as is the nature of the composition, according to the aims to be achieved and the given circumstances.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the methods of application for the compositions, i.e. the methods for controlling pests of the type mentioned, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading, dressing, scattering or pouring, to be chosen according to the aims to be achieved and the given circumstances, and the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the type mentioned. Typical rates of concentration here are between 0.1 and 1000 ppm, preferably between 0.1 and 500 ppm, of active compound. The rate of application can vary within wide limits and depends on the nature of the soil, the nature of the application, (leaf application; seed dressing, application in the seed furrow), the crop plant, the pest to be controlled, the particular climatic circumstances which prevail and other factors determined by the nature of the application, the time of application and the target crop. The rates of application per hectare are in general 1 to 2000 g of active compound per hectare, in particular 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably 20 to 600 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the field of crop protection is application to the foliage of the plants (leaf application), where the frequency of application and rate of application can be chosen according to the risk of infestation by the particular pest. However, the active compound can also enter the plants via the root system (systemic action) by impregnating the locus of the plants with a liquid composition or introducing the active compounds in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example into the soil, for example in the form of. granules (soil application). In paddy rice crops, such granules can be metered onto the flooded rice field.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are also suitable for the protection of plant propagation material, for example seeds, such as fruit, tubers, or grain, or plant seedlings, against animal pests. The propagation material can be treated with the composition before being brought out, for example seed can be dressed before sowing. The active compounds according to the invention can also be applied to the seed grains (coating) either by impregnating the grains in a liquid composition or coating them with a solid composition. The composition can also be applied to the site where the propagation material is brought out, during broadcasting, for example into the seed furrow during sowing. The invention furthermore relates to the treatment methods for plant propagation material and the plant propagation material treated in this way.<br>

Biological Examples (% = per cent by weight, unless stated otherwise)<br>
A synergistic effect is always present if the action EA of the combination of an active compound of the formula (A) with one of the active compounds (I) to (CLXXXIV) is greater than the sum of the action of the active compounds applied individually:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
However, the pesticidal action EA to be expected for a given combination of two pesticides can also be calculated as follows (cf. COLBY, S.R., "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic response of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, Pages 20-22, 1967).<br>
In this equation:	(Equation Removed)<br><br>
X =   Per cent mortality on treatment with the compound of the formula (A) at a rate of application of p kg per hectare compared with the untreated control (= 0 %).<br>
Y =   Per cent mortality on treatment with a compound (I) to (CLXXXIV) at a rate of application of q kg per hectare compared with the untreated control.<br>
EA = Expected pesticidal action (per cent mortality compared with the untreated control) after treatment with the compound of the formula (A) and a compound (I) to (CLXXXIV) at a rate of application of p + q kg of active compound per hectare.<br>
If the action actually observed is greater than the expected value EA, synergism exists.<br>
