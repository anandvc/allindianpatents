				<td>METHOD FOR MAKING AN ISOMALTO-OLIGOSACCHARIDE GRAIN COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention describes grain compositions containing isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides and methods for making the same. The method includes the<br>
derivation of the isomalto-oligosaccharides from the starch contained within the<br>
grain.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharides ("IMOs") are mixed linkage oligosaccharides, having<br>
mixtures of 1,4 alpha and/or 1,6 alpha glucosidic linkages. They are also known<br>
as anomalously linked oligosaccharides ("ALOs"). Isomalto-oligosaccharides<br>
contain a substantial amount of branched oligo-saccharides such as isomaltose,<br>
panose, isomaltotriose, isomaltotetraose, isopanose and hiaher branched oligo-<br>
saccharides.<br>
There is a market demand for products containing IMO's. I MO products are sold<br>
in powder or liquid form, depending on the intended application. The potential<br>
applications are situated in the food area. Examples of IMO products are:<br>
seasonings (mayonnaise, vinegar, soup base etc.), confectionery (candy,<br>
chewing gum, chocolate, ice cream, sherbet, syrup), processed foods of fruits<br>
and vegetables (jam, marmalade, fruit sauces, pickles), meat or fish foods (ham,<br>
sausage, etc.), bakery products (bread, cake, cookie, pastry), precooked foods<br>
(salad, boiled beans, etc.), canned and bottled foods, convenience foods (instant<br>
coffee, instant cake base, etc.), and beverages, both alcoholic (liquor, seju, wine,<br>
sake, beer [International Publication No. WO 02/20712 A1], etc.) and non-<br>
alcoholic (coffee, juice, nectar, aerated or carbonated drinks, lemonade, cola).<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharide can further be applied as ingredients in animal feed<br><br>
and pet foods. Non-food application areas are cosmetics and medicine<br>
(cigarette, lipstick, toothpaste, internal medicine, etc.).<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharides belong to a group of oligosaccharides classified as<br>
functional-health food oligosaccharides ("FHFO"). Exemplary IMO's include<br>
fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides and<br>
gentio-oligosaccharides. IMO's have been linked to the increase of the general<br>
well being of humans and animals when taken orally on a regular dally basis and<br>
are classified as "prebiotics". Prebiotics are defined as non-digestible<br>
substances (e.g., dietary fiber) that exert some biological effect on humans by<br>
selective stimulation of growth or bioactivity of beneficial microorganisms either<br>
present or therapeutically introduced to the intestine. (Przemyslaw Jan Tomasik<br>
and Plotr Tomasik. 2003 American Association of Cereal Chemists, Inc. 80(2):<br>
113-117). The "prebiotic" action of the oligosaccharides is to increase the<br>
numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli ("prebiotic") in the large intestine and to<br>
reduce the concentration of putrifactive bacteria. Bifidobacteria are associated<br>
with some health promoting properties like the inhibition of the growth of<br>
pathogens, either by acid formation or by anti-microbial activity. They are also<br>
associated with such diverse effects as the modulation of the immune system<br>
(anti-tumor properties), the reduction of the levels of triglycerides and<br>
cholesterol, the production of vitamins (B group), the reduction of blood<br>
ammonia concentrations, the prevention of translocation, the restoration of the<br>
normal gut flora after anti-microbial therapy, the production of digestive<br>
enzymes, the reduction of antibiotic associated side effects (Kohmoto T., Fukui<br>
F., Takaku H., Machida Y., et al., Bifidobacteria Microflora, 7(2)(1988),61-69;<br>

242). Modler, H.W., 1992, "Compounds which enhance the growth of Prebiotic<br>
Bacteria", presented at the International Roundtable on Animal Feed<br>
Biotechnology, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.<br><br>
The isomalto-oligosaccharides are synthesized by an enzyme catalyzed<br>
transglucosylation reaction using a D-glucosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.24,<br>
transglucosidase, alpha-glucosidase). This enzyme catalyzes both hydrolytic<br>
and transfer reactions on incubation with alpha-D-gluco-oligosaccharides. The<br>
transfer occurs most frequently to 6-OH (hydroxyl group 6 of the glucose<br>
molecule), producing isomaltose from D-glucose, or panose from maltose. The<br>
enzyme can also transfer to the 2-OH or 3-OH of D-glucose to form kojibiose or<br>
nigerose, or back to 4-OH to reform maltose. As a result of transglucosidase<br>
reactions, the malto-oligosaccharides are converted into isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides resulting in a class of oligosaccharides containing a higher<br>
proportion of glucose moieties linked to a primary hydroxy! group of a glucose<br>
molecule from the non-reducing end, e.g., by alpha-D-1,6 glucosidic linkages.<br>
The transglucosidase from A. niqer acts only on oligosaccharides with a low<br>
degree polymerization (DP) (McCleary B. V., Gibson T. S., Carbohydrate<br>
Research 185(1989)147-162; Benson C. P., Kelly C.T., Fogarty W. M., J. Chem.<br>
Tech. Biotechnol., 32(1982)790-798; Pazur J. H., Tominaga Y., DeBrosse C. W.,<br>
Jackman L. M., Carbohydrate Research, 61(1978) 279-290). Degree of<br>
polymerization refers to the number of dextrose units. For example, a di-<br>
glucosyl molecule, for example maltose, has a DP of 2. These sugars are<br>
receiving increased attention as food additives because they help prevent dental<br>
caries (Oshima, et.al 1988. The caries inhibitory effects of gos-sugar in vitro and<br>
rat experiments. Microbial Immunol. 32,1093-1105) and improve human<br>
intestinal microflora acting as a growth factor (prebiotic) for bifidobacteria<br>
(Komoto.et.al 1988; Effect of Isomalto-oligosaccharides on human fecal flora<br>
Bifidobacteria Micro flora 7,61-69).<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharides can be obtained in different ways. For example<br>
glucose syrups at high dry solids concentration i.e. 60-80% are treated with<br>
glucoamylase resulting in the formation of isomalto-oligosaccharides mainly<br>
DP2. The high solids levels are present to force the reaction to reverse from the<br>
normal direction in favor of hydrolysis.<br><br>
Grains, including wheat, barley, etc., are excellent raw materials in the<br>
commercial production of many value added functional food ingredients such as<br>
wheat flour, starch, starch hydrolysates (glucose, fructose, high maltose syrup,<br>
etc.) and wheat gluten. Syrup containing a high level of maltose is also used in<br>
many microbial fermentations as a carbon source in the production of antibiotics,<br>
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biochemical, such as alcohol (both potable and fuel),<br>
amino acids, organic acids, etc and recently in the production of functional health<br>
-food oligosaccarides called isomalto-oligosaccharides. In a conventional<br>
process for the production of starch hydrolysate, such as maltose syrups, the<br>
insoluble granular starch is generally separated from other cellular components<br>
of wheat prior to the hydrolysis by starch liquefying and maltogenic alpha<br>
amylases enzymes. Maltose is a disaccharide consisting of two glucosyl<br>
residues linked by a 1-4 D-glucosidic linkage and is the smallest in the family of<br>
malto-oligosaccharides. It is produced on a large scale as syrup, powder and<br>
crystals in several grades of purity. Various maltose syrups are drawing<br>
considerable interest for commercial applications in brewing, baking, soft drink<br>
canning, confectionary and other food and beverage industries. Ultra pure<br>
maltose is used as an intravenous nutrient in Japan. Catalytic reduction of<br>
maltose results in maltitol, which is considered to be a low calorie sweetener.<br>
Recently, high maltose syrup has become a key raw material for industrial<br>
production of isomalto-oligosaccharides (J. K. Shetty and O. J. Lantero, 1999<br>
Transglucosylation of Malto-oligosaccharides." Paper presented at 50th Starch<br>
Convention, Detmold, Germany).<br>
In a conventional process for the production of starch hydrolysate such as high<br>
maltose syrup, the insoluble starch is separated prior to the hydrolysis by<br>
thermostable liquefying alpha amylases [EC 3.2.1.2,alpha (1,4)-glucan<br>
glucanohydrolase] derived either from Bacillus licheniformis or Bacillus<br>
stearothermophilus. Hydrolysis of the purified starch (refined) is carried out by<br>
suspending insoluble granular starch in water (30-35 % dissolved solid basis<br>
[dsb]) and heated to a temperature of between 85° C and 120 ° C to solubilize<br>
the starch and making it susceptible for enzymatic hydrolysis. The liquefied<br>
starch is further processed to manufacture starch hydrolysate with different<br><br>
carbohydrate composition using specific maltose producing enzymes such as<br>
fungal alpha amylase (sold under the tradename CLARASE L from Genencor<br>
International, Palo Alto, CA) for syrup containing less than 55% maltose, p<br>
Amylase (sold under the tradename OPTIMALT BBA from Genencor<br>
International, Palo Alto, CA) for syrup containing maltose content between 55%<br>
and 62% and less than1% glucose. For higher levels of maltose syrup, &gt;62%,<br>
addition of debranching enzyme (sold under the tradename OPTIMAX L-1000<br>
from Genencor International, Palo Alto, CA) in conjunction p Amylase is useful.<br>
(Faigh, J.; Duan, G.; Strohm, B. and Shetty, J. (2002) "Production of Maltose,<br>
High Maltose &amp; Very High Maltose Syrups," Technical Bulletin, Genencor<br>
International Inc.).<br>
A process for converting granular starch (refined) into soluble hydrolysate by<br>
incubating with bacterial alpha amylase at a temperature below the starch<br>
gelatinization temperature (Leach et.al 1978; US Pat. No. 4,113,509) and<br>
subsequent hydrolysis by beta amylase to produce high maltose syrup have<br>
been reported (Leach et.al 1975;US Pat. No. 3,922,196), However the syrup<br>
produced by such process resulted in only 55 % maltose of the total sugar<br>
content, with a very high level of maltotriose. The process for producing high<br>
maltose syrup using liquefied starch (gelatinized followed by hydrolysis using<br>
thermostable alpha amylase) is described in European Patent Application<br>
#0905256 (Christophersen, et.al 2000) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,859 (Nimmi,<br>
et.al 1992). The process is cumbersome, expensive and it requires the<br>
separation of starch from other cellular components, high cost of the additional<br>
maltose producing enzymes, high temperature treatment and longer reaction<br>
time. European Patent Application #0350737 A2 (Shinke, et.al 1989) disclosed<br>
a process for producing maltose syrup by hydrolyzing a granular (purified) starch<br>
from corn, wheat, potato and sweet potato at 60° C without the conventional<br>
liquefaction step (gelatinization followed by liquefaction at high temperature)<br>
using an alpha amylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus. However, the<br>
hydrolyzed starch resulted in a maltose concentration ranging from 50% to 55%.<br>
The syrup also contained very high level of maltotriose (30-36%). The process<br>
resulted in a ratio of maitose to maltotriose less than 2.0 irrespective of the<br><br>
source of the starch. Maltose syrup containing a high level of maltotriose is not<br>
a preferred substrate as carbon feed in many microbial fermentations including<br>
the alcohol fermentation by yeast because of the difficulties in metabolizing<br>
maltotriose. Maltose is a preferred donor of glucosyl residue in the<br>
transglucosylation reaction catalyzed by glucosyltransferases in the production<br>
of isomalto-oligosaccharides (J. K. Shetty and O. J. Lantero, 1999<br>
"Transglucosylation of Malto-oligosaccharides." Paper presented at 50th Starch<br>
Convention, Detmold, Germany). U.S. Pat. No. 6,361,809 described a method<br>
for producing maltose and a limit dextrin by treating the purified granular waxy<br>
maize starch with a hydrolase, maltogenase alpha amylase classified as EC<br>
3.2.1.133 from Bacillus stearothermophilus followed by separating the maltose<br>
using ultra filtration process. Evaporation of the dilute permeate containing the<br>
maltose is expensive because of high energy cost and also faces a very high<br>
risk of microbial contamination.<br>
Traditionally grains such as wheat, malt, sorghum (milo), millet (ragi), particularly<br>
whole grains are used in nutrition as carriers of macro- and micro- elements,<br>
proteins, fiber and vitamins. The majority of cereal grains appeared to be too<br>
readily digested to play an effective role as prebiotics or even as nutraceuticals.<br>
It has been suggested that designing genetically modified, less digestible cereals<br>
suitable as prebiotics to manipulate gut microflora (Gibson, G.R, and Roberfroid,<br>
M. B. 1995, Dietary modulation of the human colonic micrflora: Introducing the<br>
concept of prebiotics. J. Nutr. 125, 1401-1412).<br>
There is a continuing interest in methods for producing grain compositions with<br>
isomalto-oligosaccharides enzymatically derived from the source substrate, e.g.,<br>
grain or tuber, without having to separate the starch from other grain<br>
components and/or subject the starch of the substrate to high temperatures of jet<br>
cooking prior to transglucosidation action. There is also a continuing interest in<br>
low DH processes for minimizing the risk of microbial contamination. The<br>
present invention addresses these interests.<br><br>

Substrates<br>
The present invention includes a substrate containing a starch, for example a<br>
grain or a tuber containing a starch that is contacted with a maltogenic enzyme<br><br>
and a starch liquefying enzyme to produce maltose. The term substrate refers to<br>
materials that can be enzymatically converted to maltose and thus IMO's.<br>
Exemplary substrates can be at least one substrate selected from the group<br>
consisting of grains and tubers. The maltose can be in the form of a maltose<br>
rich syrup or slurry.<br>
Starch occurs in two forms, amylose, a linear chain polysaccharide, and<br>
amylopectin, a branched chain polysaccharide. Amylose contains long<br>
unbranched chains in which all the D-glucose units are linked by alpha-1,4-<br>
linkages ("a-1,4 linkages" or "1,4-a-D-glucosyl linkages"). Amylopectin is highly<br>
branched, the backbone glucosidic linkage being a-1,4, but the branch points<br>
being a-1,6 linkages. The major components of starch can be enzymatically<br>
hydrolyzed in two different ways. Amylose can be hydrolyzed by a-amylases<br>
(E.C. 3.2.1.1), e.g., a-(1-4)-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase. Alpha amylases<br>
hydrolyze the a-(1,4)-linkages to yield a mixture of glucose, maltose, maltotriose<br>
and higher sugars. Amylose can also be hydrolyzed by a beta-amlylase (E.C.<br>
r<br>
3.2.1.2) [alpha(1,4)-glucan maltohydrolase, 1,4-a-D-glucan maltohydrolase ].<br>
This enzyme cleaves away successive maltose units beginning from the non-<br>
reducing end to yield maltose quantitatively. The alpha and beta amylases also<br>
hydrolyze amylopectin. Neither the alpha and beta amylases can hydrolyze the<br>
alpha (1-6) linkages at the branch points of amylopectin. The end product of<br>
exhaustive beta-amylase action on amylopectin is a large, highly branched core<br>
or beta limit dextrin. A debranching enzyme (E.C. 3.2.1.41 .e.g., pullulanases,<br>
[a-(1-6)-glucan 6-glucanohydrolase, also called a-(1,6)-glucosidase]) can<br>
hydrolyze the a-(1-6) linkages at the branch points. Thus the combined action<br>
of p-amylase and the a 1,6-glucosidase can therefore completely degrade<br>
amylopectin to maltose and glucose, resulting in a maltose content as high as<br>
60%, 65%, 79%, 75%, 80% or higher of the total sugar content.<br>
For the purposes of this invention, the substrate containing starch can be a grain<br>
or a tuber or mixtures thereof. The grain can be any cereal or seed containing<br>
starch. The substrate can be milled, ground or otherwise reduced in size to<br>
increase the surface area of the substrate for contacting with the respective<br>
enzymes. For example, the substrate can be wet or dry milled as desired. In<br><br>
one embodiment of the present invention, the starch is granular starch. Grains<br>
contemplated for use within the present invention includes any grain currently<br>
used in baking, pasta or other uses. Exemplary grains contemplated by the<br>
inventors include, but are not limited to at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of wheat (Triticum sp. Including, but not limited to T. monococcum. T.<br>
turgidum. T. spelta. and/or T. aestivum). barley (e.g., Hordeum vulaare. and the<br>
varieties described in U.S.Pat. No. 6,492,576, Table 1), rye (Secale sp..<br>
including but not limited to S. cereale). corn (Zea sp.. including, but not limited to<br>
Zea mays), buckwheat (Faqoprvum sp., including, but not limited to F<br>
esculentum), malt (for example, germinated barley), sorghum (Sorghum sp..<br>
including, but not limited to Sorghum bicolor') or otherwise known as milo, millet<br>
(ragi) (Panicum sp.and Setaria sp.. including, but not limited to P. milaceum: and<br>
Setaria sp., including, but not limited to Sitalica) and rice (Orvza sp.. including,<br>
but not limited to Orvza sativa). It is contemplated by the inventors that wild-type<br>
and transgenic plants having beneficial attributes, such as increased enzyme<br>
levels of endogenous enzymes or the presence of exogenous enzymes are also<br>
useful as starch containing substrates.<br>
Germinated cereals, for example, malt, are used as one of the key ingredients in<br>
many food and health drink formulations because of their high nutritive value,<br>
e.g., malt containing food products (TABLE A). Germination results in the<br>
synthesis and activation of endogenous maltogenic and proteolytic enzymes.<br>
Thus germinated cereals are a good source of grains containing endogenous<br>
maltogenic enzymes. Malt flour and malt extract are also used as a source of<br>
digestive enzymes in brewing and baking applications. However, germination of<br>
the barley renders the cereal grain components too readily digestible to play an<br>
effective role as a prebiotic or even as a nutraceuticals, since they tend to be<br>
digested in their entirety before arrival in the lower gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Unfortunately, the beneficial effects of prebiotic compounds are best realized in<br>
the lower gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, converting the highly digestible malto-<br>
sugars into less digestible isomalto sugars allows for the use of the modified<br>
malt to play a role as a prebiotic, allowing the malt to arrive in the lower<br>
gastrointestinal tract and provide additional functional and health benefits. For<br><br><br>
Thus the use of malt as a starch containing substrate converts some of the<br>
granular starch contained within the substrate to an additional beneficial form of<br>
the oligosaccharide, e.g., an IMO.<br>
In addition, the substrate containing starch can be a tuber. Tubers contemplated<br>
by the inventors include potato (Solanum sp.. including, but not limited to S<br>
tuberosum), sweet potato (Ipomoea sp.. including, but not limited to Ipomoea<br>
batatas), manioc [tapioca, cassava] (Manihot sp., including, but not limited to<br>
Manihot esculenta, Manihot aipi and Manihot utilissima) and/or taro root<br>
(Colocasia sp., including, not limited to C. esculenta or C. macrorhiza).<br>
The amount of substrate containing starch can be an aqueous slurry<br>
characterized by having a concentration of 10 to 50% dissolved solids (DS). In<br>
another embodiment, the substrate containing starch is characterized by having<br>
a concentration of 2 -90% DS. In another embodiment, the substrate containing<br>
starch is characterized by having a concentration of 5 -70% DS. In another<br><br>
embodiment, the substrate containing starch is characterized by having a<br>
concentration of 10-60% DS. In another embodiment, the substrate containing<br>
starch is characterized by having a concentration of 20-40% DS. In another<br>
embodiment, the substrate containing starch is characterized by having a<br>
concentration of 25-35% DS.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pH of the substrate containing<br>
starch is between 1.00 to 9.00. In another embodiment of the invention, the pH<br>
of the substrate containing starch is between 2.00 to 8.00. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention, the pH of the substrate containing starch is<br>
between 3.00 to 7.50. In another embodiment of the invention, the pH of the<br>
substrate containing starch is between 4.00 to 6.50. In another embodiment of<br>
the invention, the pH of the substrate containing starch is between 4.25 to 5.75.<br>
Enzymes<br>
The present invention includes contacting the substrate containing starch with a<br>
maltogenic and a starch liquefying enzyme to produce maltose. By maltogenic<br>
is meant that the enzyme is able to enzymatically convert starch to maltose.<br>
Exemplary maltogenic enzymes include alpha amylases and beta amylases. As<br>
described before, amylose can be hydrolyzed by D-amylases (E.C. 3.2.1.1),<br>
e.g., D-(1-4)-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase. Alpha amylases hydrolyzethe D-(1,4)-<br>
linkages to yield a mixture of glucose, maltose, maltotriose and higher sugars.<br>
Amylose can also be hydrolyzed by a beta-amlylase (E.C. 3.2.1.2) [alpha(1,4)-<br>
glucan maltohydrolase, 1,4-D-D-glucan maltohydrolase ]. This enzyme cleaves<br>
away successive maltose units beginning from the non-reducing end to yield<br>
maltose quantitatively. The alpha and beta amylases also hydrolyze<br>
amylopectin.<br>
Alpha Amylases -<br>

thermostable fungal alpha amylase. Suitable alpha amylases may be naturally<br>
occurring as well as recombinant and mutant alpha amylases. In some<br><br>
embodiments, the alpha amylase is derived from a Bacillus species. Preferred<br>
Bacillus species include Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. lentus, B. licheniformis,<br>
and B. stearothermophilus. In particularly preferred embodiments, the alpha<br>
amylase is derived from a Aspergillus species. Preferred Aspergillus species<br>

the invention include; CLARASE L (fAspergilus orvzael Genencor International<br>
Inc.) and NOVAMYL ([B stearothermophilus] Novozyme Biotech.).<br>
As understood by those in the art, the quantity of alpha amylase used in the<br>
methods of the present invention will depend on the enzymatic activity of the<br>
alpha amylase. In general, an amount of about 0.01 to 5.0 kg of the alpha<br>
amylase is added to a metric ton (MT) of the substrate containing starch.<br>
Although in some embodiments the alpha amylase is added in an amount about<br>
0.05 to 4.0 kg per MT. In other embodiments, the alpha amylase is added in an<br>
amount of about 0.1 to 2.5 kg per MT and also about 0.5 to 1.5 kg per MT. In<br>
further embodiments, other quantities are utilized. For example, generally an<br>
amount of between about 0.01 to 1.5 kg of CLARASE L (Genencor International<br>
Inc.) is added to a MT of starch. In other embodiments, the enzyme is added in<br>
an amount between about 0.05 to 1.0 kg; between about 0.1 to 0.6 kg; between<br>
about 0.2 to 0.6 kg and between about 0.4 to 0.6 kg of CLARASE L per MT of<br>
starch.<br>

In some of the embodiments encompassed by the invention, the maltogenic<br>
enzyme is a beta amylase. While alpha amylases are maltogenic in the sense<br>
that contacting alpha amylases with a substrate containing starch would provide<br>
maltose, the use of beta amylases are useful in that their contact with granular<br>
starch would provide a greater amount of maltose to the exclusion of other<br>
saccharides, e.g., glucose. In some embodiments, the beta amylase is a plant<br>
or microbial enzyme having ah E.C. number, E.C. 3.2.1.2 (for example those<br>
beta amylases described in US 4,970,158 and 4,647,538). In some<br><br>
embodiments, the beta amylase is a thermostable bacterial beta amylase.<br>
Suitable beta amylases may be naturally occurring as well as recombinant and<br>
mutant beta amylases. The term bacterial refers to the enzyme being derived<br>
from Bacillus sp.. e.g., B. subtilis. B. licheniformis. B. stearothermophilus. B^<br>
coaqulans. B. amyloliquefaciens. and/or B. lentus. Particularly preferred beta<br>
amylases are derived from Bacillus strains B. stearothermophilus, B.<br>
amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis. Also reference is made to strains having<br>
NCIB 11608. The term plant origin refers to the enzyme being derived,<br>
extracted, isolated, expressed from a plant source, for example from barley malt,<br>
soybean, wheat or barley.<br>
Commercially available beta amylases contemplated for use in the methods of<br>
the invention include; OPTIMALT BBA, Spezyme DBA, and OPTIMALT ME<br>
(Genencor International Inc.). Other commercially available wheat beta<br>
amylases are also useful in the methods of the invention.<br>
In some embodiments, the substrate containing starch, e.g., wheat, rye, barley,<br>
malt, comprises an endogenous maltogenic enzyme at sufficient levels to<br>
produce sufficient maltose for conversion to isomalto oligosaccharides.. The<br>
term "endogenous" refers to the enzyme being present in the grain or tuber<br>
without having to resort to adding the maltogenic enzyme to the grain, or the<br>
grain being genetically engineered to provide maltogenic enzymes.<br>
In embodiments where the substrate containing starch does not contain an<br>
endogenous maltogenic enzyme or has low endogenous levels of maltogenic<br>
enzymes, e.g., rice, millet, sorghum, and/or corn, the addition of an equivalent<br>
amount of any exogenous maltogenic enzyme is also contemplated by the<br>
inventors. The exogenous maltogenic enzyme can be added, for example by<br>
genetically manipulating the host cell to express sufficient levels of maltogenic<br>
enzyme, and/or providing a maltogenic enzyme concentrate or material from<br>
another source. The term exogenous maltogenic enzyme refers to a maltogenic<br>
enzyme that is not present within the grain. In this embodiment, a sufficient<br><br>
amount of maltogenic enzyme is contacted with the substrate to produce<br>
maltose.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount of exogenous maltogenic enzyme contacted<br>
with the substrate containing starch is between 0.050 to 5.000 Degrees of<br>
Diastatic Power ("DP0") units /gm of maltogenic enzyme. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention, 0.100 to 2.000 DP0 units/gm of maltogenic enzyme<br>
is contacted with the grain containing a starch. In still another embodiment of<br>
the invention, 0.100 to 3.000 DP0 units/gm of maltogenic enzyme is contacted<br>
with the grain containing a starch.<br>
In another embodiment, the amount of exogenous maltogenic enzyme contacted<br>
with the substrate containing starch is expressed in kilograms of maltogenic<br>
enzyme per metric ton of substrate. In one embodiment, the amount of<br>
exogenous maltogenic enzyme contacted with the substrate is about 0.05 kg of<br>
maltogenic enzyme per metric ton dry solids basis ("kg/mt dsb"). In another<br>
embodiment, the amount of exogenous maltogenic enzyme is about 0.1 kg of<br>
maltogenic enzyme per metric ton dry solids basis ("kg/mt dsb"). In other<br>
embodiments 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8. and/or 1.0 kg/mt dsb provide sufficient amounts<br>
of maltogenic enzyme, e.g., (3-amylase.<br>
In another embodiment, the amount of exogenous maltogenic enzyme contacted<br>
with the substrate containing starch is expressed in kilograms of maltogenic<br>
enzyme per metric ton of substrate. In one embodiment, the amount of<br>
exogenous maltogenic enzyme contacted with the substrate is about 0.05 kg of<br>
maltogenic enzyme per metric ton dissolved starch basis ("kg/mt dsb"). In<br>
another embodiment, the amount of exogenous maltogenic enzyme is about 0.1<br>
kg of maltogenic enzyme per metric ton dissolved starch basis ("kg/mt dsb"). In<br>
other embodiments 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8. and/or 1.0 kg/mt dissolved starch basis<br>
provide sufficient amounts of maltogenic enzyme, e.g., p-amylase.<br>
In another embodiment, the amount of maltogenic enzyme to be contacted with<br>
the grain is in terms of maltogenic enzyme units. Assays useful to determine<br>
the maltogenic activity include those described in the examples and those<br>
describing |3-amylase activity. The term DP° unit refers to the amount of<br><br>
enzyme contained in 0.10 ml of a 5% solution of the sample enzyme preparation<br>
that will produce sufficient reducing sugars to reduce 5 ml of Fehling's solution<br>
when the sample is incubated with 100 ml of substrate for 1 hour at 20° C (68°<br>
F).<br>
In another embodiment, a grain having endogenous maltogenic enzymes<br>
(barley, wheat, etc.) can be mixed with those grains needing exogenous<br>
maltogenic enzymes. Mixtures of 30:70, 60:40, 50:50, 60:40, 70:30 grains<br>
having an endogenous maltogenic enzyme: grains utilizing exogenous<br>
maltogenic enzyme sources are contemplated by the inventors, so long as<br>
sufficient amounts of maltogenic enzymes are present in the mixture<br>
(endogenous or exogenous sources). Use of endogenous sources of<br>
maltogenic enzymes can reduce the amount of exogenous enzymes added or<br>
contacted with the grain mixture.<br>
Starch liquefying enzymes<br>
A starch liquefying enzyme is contacted with the starch to reduce the viscosity of<br>
the liquefied or solubilized starch. In one embodiment of the invention the starch<br>
liquefying enzyme is an enzyme selected from the E.G. 3.2.1.1, e.g., alpha<br>
amylases. Exemplary alpha-amylases can be derived, isolated or extracted from<br>
a bacterial source. In one embodiment, the bacterial source is a Bacillus. In<br>
another embodiment, the alpha-amylases derived from Bacillus include those<br>
derived from at least one bacterial source selected from B. subtilis. B.<br>
licheniformis, B. stearothermophilus. B. coaqulans. B. amvloliquefaciens. and B..<br>
lentus. Those of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus stearothermophilus are<br>
especially useful. Other amylases are contemplated by the inventors, for<br>
example, but not limited to those of EC 3.2.1.133 (U.S.Pat. No. 6,361,809).<br>
Other amylases contemplated by the inventors include those characterized by<br>
increased oxidative or thermostability, including those mutants or genetically<br>
modified or variant amylases described in U.S.Patent Nos. 5,763,385;<br>
5,824,532; 5,958,739; and/or 6,008,026. Useful alpha amylases are those<br>
derived from B. licheniformis strains NCIB 8059, ATCC 6598, ATCC 6634,<br><br>
ATCC 8480, ATCC 9945A, ATCC 11945. Useful alpha amylases are those<br>
derived from B. stearothermophilus strains ATCC 39709. Such enzymes are<br>
identified by the trade names "SPEZYME AA" or "SPEZYME FRED", "SPEZYME<br>
LT300", and "SPEZYME LT75", available from Genencor International (Palo<br>
Also, California, USA). Other such enzymes include alpha amylases from<br>
Bacillus stearothermophilus sold under the tradename GZYME G997, GC007<br>
and from Bacillus licheniformis sold under the tradename GC262 SP, also<br>
available from Genencor International.<br>
Contacting the grain containing starch with the maltogenic enzyme and the<br>
starch liquefying enzyme produces maltose. As understood by those in the art,<br>
the quantity of starch liquefying enzyme used in the methods of the present<br>
invention will depend on the enzymatic activity of the starch liquefying enzyme.<br>
In one embodiment, 0.01 to 25 Liquefon Units/gm of starch liquefying enzyme is<br>
contacted with the grain containing starch. In another embodiment, 1 to 10<br>
Liquefon Units/gm of starch liquefying enzyme is contacted with the grain<br>
containing a starch. One Liquefon Unit (LU) is the measure of digestion time<br>
required to produce a color change with iodine solution, indicating a definite<br>
stage of dextrinization of starch substrate under specified conditions.<br>
In one embodiment, 0.1 kg of starch liquefying enzyme is added per metric ton<br>
of grain dissolved solid basis (kg/mt dsb). In other embodiments, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4,<br>
0.8, or 1.0 kg of starch liquefying enzyme is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt<br>
dissolved starch basis). In one embodiment, 0.1 kg of starch liquefying enzyme<br>
is added per metric ton of grain dissolved starch basis (kg/mt dissolved starch<br>
basis). In other embodiments, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.0 kg of starch liquefying<br>
enzyme is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt dissolved starch basis). Assays<br>
useful to determine the starch liquefying activity include those described in the<br>
examples herein. Exemplary assays for the determination of a-amylase activity<br>
are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,763,385; 5,824,532; 5,958,739; and/or<br>
6,008,026 which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Transglucosidic enzyme<br><br>
Contacting the maltose with a transglucosidic enzyme obtains a grain<br>
composition having an enzymatically produced isomalto-oligosaccharide,<br>
derived from the grain containing starch. The transglucosidic enzyme catalyzes<br>
hydrolytic and transfer reactions on incubation with alpha-D-gluco-<br>
oligosaccharides to produce isomaltose, panose, kojibiose or nigerose. The<br>
presence of these sugars and thus conversion by the transglucosidic enzyme is<br>
indicated in an increased amount of DP2 disaccharides. The transglucosidic<br>
enzyme (E.C. 2.4.1.24) can be transglucosidase. Exemplary transglucosidase<br>
enzymes are identified as TRANSGLUCOSIDASE L-1000 (Genencor<br>
International, Inc.) and TRANSGLUCOSIDE L by Amano Enzymes, Inc.,<br>
(Nagoya, Japan). In one embodiment the transglucosidic enzyme is derived<br>
from a filamentous fungal source, e.g., Aspergillus SP. The transglucosidic<br>
enzyme that is derived from Aspergillus can be derived from Aspergillus niger.<br>
In one embodiment, the Aspergillus niger strain is ATCC14916.<br>
In this embodiment, a sufficient amount of the transglucosidic enzyme is<br>
contacted with the substrate, e.g. the grain containing a starch to produce<br>
maltose. As understood by those in the art, the quantity of transglucosidic<br>
enzyme used in the methods of the present invention will depend on the<br>
enzymatic activity of the alpha amylase. In one embodiment, 0.01 to 25.00<br>
transglucosidase units ("TGU")/gm of transglucosidase is contacted with the<br>
grain containing a starch. In another embodiment of the invention, 0.05 TGU to<br>
10.00 TGU/gm of transglucosidase is contacted with the grain containing a<br>
starch. In still another embodiment of the invention, 0.10 to 5.00 TGU /gm of<br>
grain is contacted with the grain containing a starch. The term TGU refers to the<br>
activity of the enzyme required to produce one micromole of panose per minute<br>
under the conditions of the assay.<br>
In one embodiment, 0.05 to 6.00 kg of transglucosidic enzyme is added per<br>
metric ton of grain (kg/mt dsb). In another embodiment, 0.10 to 5.00 kg of<br>
transglucosidic enzyme is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt dsb). In another<br>
embodiment, 0.25 to 3.00 kg of transglucosidic enzyme is added per metric ton<br>
of grain (kg/mt dsb). In another embodiment, 0.50 to 1.50 kg of transglucosidic<br>
enzyme is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt dsb). Additional assays useful to<br><br>
determine the transglucosidic activity include those described in the Examples<br>
and in Shetty, J., et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,575,487 (1986) entitled, "Method for<br>
determination of transglucosidase"), which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In one embodiment, 0.05 to 6.00 kg of transglucosidic enzyme is added per<br>
metric ton of dissolved starch (kg/mt starch dsb). In another embodiment, 0.10<br>
to 5.00 kg of transglucosidic enzyme is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt<br>
starch dsb). In another embodiment, 0.25 to 3.00 kg of transglucosidic enzyme<br>
is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt starch dsb). In another embodiment, 0.50<br>
to 1.50 kg of transglucosidic enzyme is added per metric ton of grain (kg/mt<br>
starch dsb).<br>
As a result of transglucosidase reactions, the malto-oligosaccharides are<br>
converted to isomalto-oligosaccharides resulting in a new class of<br>
polysaccharides containing higher proportion of glucosyl residues linked to a<br>
primary hydroxyl group of a glucose molecule from the non-reducing end .<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharides produced by this method include isomaltose, panose,<br>
isomalto-triose, isomalto-tetrose, isomalto-pentose, isomalto-hexose and<br>
isomalto-heptose. These sugars are receiving increased attention as food<br>
additives because they help prevent dental caries (Oshima, et.al 1988, The<br>
caries inhibitory effects of gos-sugar in vitro and rat experiments. Microbial<br>
Immunol. 32.1093-1105 )) and improve human intestinal microflora acting as a<br>
growth factor (prebiotic) for bifidobacteria (Komoto.et.al 1988; Effect of Isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides on human fecal flora .Bifidobacteria Micro flora 7,61-69).<br>
To ascertain the production of the IMO's, assays and/or other analytical methods<br>
can be used to determine the amount of IMO produced. One method for<br>
determining the levels of IMO produced includes high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC). For example, analysis of the mixture can provide an<br>
indication of the levels of the various sugars produced by the process. A useful<br>
rating is the degree of polymerization (DP) of the mixture. The term degree of<br>
polymerization is a measure of ther relative amounts of the number of glucose<br>
residues in the molecule. For example, glucose (one glucosyl unit, the lowest<br>
level of polymerization) is usually found as DP1. Isomalto-oligosaccharides are<br><br>
usually found in DP2 (two glucosyl units). In one embodiment, the grain<br>
composition contains greater than at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 25%, at least<br>
40%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70% by<br>
weight of at least one isomalto-oligosaccharide. In one embodiment the at least<br>
one isomalto-oligosaccharide is selected from the group of isomaltose, panose<br>
and/or isomalto-triose. In one embodiment, the amount of isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides produced in the grain composition is between 1% and 99% of<br>
the grain composition. In one embodiment, the amount of isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides produced in the grain composition is between 1 % and 90% of<br>
the grain composition. In one embodiment, the amount of isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides produced in the grain composition is between 1 % and 80% of<br>
the grain composition. In one embodiment, the amount of isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides produced in the grain composition is between 1% and 70% of<br>
the grain composition. In one embodiment of the present invention, the total<br>
sugar present in the grain composition after the above described procedure<br>
includes a level of maltose in the total sugar content of greater than 50%,<br>
greater than 60%, greater than 70%, or greater than 80%. Levels of maltose<br>
greater than 50% include ranges from 50% to 85%, from 55% to 80%, and/or<br>
from 60% to 75%. The term RBS ratio refers to the ratio of maltose (DP2)<br>
present in the grain as compared to the level of maltotriose (DPS) present in the<br>
resultant grain composition. A higher RBS value indicates a higher amount of<br>
maltose present and thus a more complete conversion of the starch to maltose<br>
as opposed to the presence of other less desireable end-products, e.g.,<br>
maltotriose. In one embodiment, the RBS ratio is greater than 2.0. In one<br>
embodiments, the RBS ratio is greater than 3.0, greater than 4.0. Exemplary<br>
ranges include an RBS ratio of 2.0 to 50.0, 2.0 to 30.0 and/or 2.0 to 10.0.<br>
Various RBS ratios are described in the examples. It is noted that the hydrolysis<br>
of liquefied starch by commercial beta-amylases (barley or wheat) generally<br>
produces a maltose content between 55% and 65%. For maltose content<br>
greater than 50% using liquefied starch, the addition of debranching enzyme<br>
and/or a very low starting DE of the liquefied starch was previously required.<br>
Optionally, the addition of a debranching enzyme can be used to increase the<br>
production of maltose. The term debranching enzyme refers to enzymes that<br><br>
catalyze the hydrolysis of a-1,6-linkages. An enzyme of the class E.C.3.2.1.41 is<br>
useful in this regard. An exemplary enzyme of this class is a pullanase, also<br>
known as a-dextrin endo-1,6- a glucosidase, limit dextrinase, debranching<br>
enzyme, amylopectin 1,6-glucanohydrolase.<br>
Contacting the grain containing starch with a maltogenic enzyme to produce the<br>
maltose and the contacting of the maltose with a transglucosidic enzyme occurs<br>
at a temperature less than the gelatinization temperature of the starch of the<br>
grain used. The enzymes are contacted or incubated with the respective<br>
enzymes for an incubation time of at least 12 hours, at least 18 hours, at least 24<br>
hours, at least 30 hours and/or at least 36 hours. The period of at least a noted<br>
time refers to a period of 12-80 hours, at least 18-60 hours and/or at least 24-48<br>
hours. The term incubation time refers to the period of time for the conversion of<br>
maltose or the substrate to IMO's. The transglucosidic enzyme can be<br>
contacted or added separately or concurrently with the substrate, e.g. grain<br>
containing starch, the maltogenic enzyme, e.g., the alpha amylase or beta<br>
amylase, and/or the liquefying enzyme, e.g., the alpha amylase. In one<br>
embodiment, the transglucosidic enzyme is added concurrently with the<br>
liquefying enzyme. Thus in one embodiment, steps (a) and (b) are performed<br>
concurrently. In another embodiment, the steps (a) and (b) are performed<br>
sequentially or separately. In another embodiment, the step (a) is performed<br>
before step (b). The term gelatinization temperature refers to the temperature at<br>
which the starch contained within the grain changes phases or gelatinizes.<br>
While the specific temperature varies from grain to grain, temperatures sufficient<br>
to effect the gelatinization of starch include those greater than 45° C, greater<br>
than 50° C, greater than 60° C, greater than 70° C, greater than 80° C, and/or<br>
greater than 90° C. Exemplary temperatures greater than the indicated<br>
gelatinization temperatures include 45° C to 120° C, 50° C to 110° C, 50° to 100°<br>
C. In one embodiment, e.g. wheat, the gelatinization temperature is a<br>
temperature the grain is kept below, e.g. a temperature selected from below 50°<br>
C to 70° C, in another embodiment below 55° C to 65° C, and in another<br>
embodiment, below 60° C. For example, gelatinization temperatures have been<br>
described for corn, potato, wheat, tapioca, waxy maize, sorghum, rice sago,<br>
arrowroot amylomaize and/or sweet potato as shown in Table 1 (Beynum, G.M.A<br><br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the slurry, after the incubation<br>
time, can be subjected to a flash heat period sufficient to halt further enzymatic<br>
activity, but not gelatinize or liquefy the slurry. For example, the slurry can be<br>
heated to a temperature of 80°, 85°, 90° 95° or 100° C for a period of 5-60<br>
minutes, 10.0 to 40.0 minutes or 30.0 minutes.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention further includes the step of<br>
separating the slurry into insolubles and solubles. The separating step can be<br>
by any chromatographic method known in the arts, for example, but not limited<br><br>
to HPLC, size exclusion and/or charge chromatography. Filtering can be used to<br>
separate the insolubles from the solubles. The insolubles or entire slurry can be<br>
subjected to the drying steps described later in this application. In another<br>
embodiment, the solubles resulting from the separating step can be<br>
concentrated by evaporation, for example by roto-evaporation, tray drying, etc.<br>
The evaporated concentrate can be subjected to carbon treatment (filtered<br>
through carbon granules) and /or further chromatographic treatment to provide<br>
an isolated IMO liquid concentrate. The isolated IMO concentrate can have an<br>
IMO concentration of greater than 75%, greater than 85%, greater than 90%,<br>
greater than 95%, greater than 97%, and/or greater than 99%.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the use or incorporation of such<br>
syrup (the isomalto-oligosaccharides enzymatically derived from the substrate<br>
having ungelatinized starch) in oral rehydration solutions. The amount of the<br>
isomalto-saccharides can be in the amounts or formulations as described as<br>
U.S.Pat. Nos. 4,981,687; 5,096,894; and/or 5,733,579.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the drying of the aforementioned<br>
isomalto-oligosaccharide substrate, grain or tuber composition to produce a<br>
powder including the grain composition. Typically, this drying step is accelerated<br>
by heating. The grain composition can be dried to a desired moisture level by<br>
using a suitable drying method, for example, but not limited to a spray dryer, tray<br>
dryer, tumble dryer, drum dryer or cabinet dryer. Other drying methodologies can<br>
be used, for example spray drying, evaporative drying under reduced pressure.<br>
By drying the grain composition, slurry, separated insolubles, and/or separated<br>
solubles, a flour or other dried powder is obtained therefrom. The resulting<br>
powder or flour can be incorporated into compositions in which the presence of<br>
isomalto-oligosaccharides is desired, for example in food stuffs (breakfast<br>
cereals, pastas), food additives and baked goods. The term food additive refers<br>
to the use of the isomalto-oligosaccharides as a sprinkle on material, as an<br>
ingredient for use in the manufacture of other foods, and/or a topical ingredient<br>
added to the food.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the dried powder can be incorporated into food<br>
supplements. The incorporation of the dried powder into a food supplement can<br>
be provided in any acceptable supplement or form. The dietary supplements can<br>
be formulated for oral administration in a matrix as, for example but not limited<br>
to, drug powders, crystals, granules, small particles (which include particles<br>
sized on the order of micrometers, such as microspheres and microcapsules),<br>
particles (which include particles sized on the order of millimeters), beads,<br>
microbeads, pellets, pills, microtablets, compressed tablets or tablettriturates,<br>
molded tablets or tablet triturates, and in capsules, which are either hard or soft<br>
and contain the composition as a powder, particle, bead, solution or suspension.<br>
The dietary supplement can also be formulated for oral administration as a<br>
solution or suspension in an aqueous liquid, as a liquid incorporated into a gel<br>
capsule or as any other convenient form for administration or for rectal<br>
administration, as a suppository, enema or other convenient form. The isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharide composition can also be provided as a controlled release<br>
system.<br>
The dietary supplement formulation can also include any type of acceptable<br>
exicipients, additives or vehicles. For example, but not by way of limitation,<br>
diluents or fillers, such as dextrates, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate,<br>
lactose, cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, dry starch, sorbitol, sucrose,<br>
inositol, powdered sugar, bentonitc, microcrystalline cellulose, or hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose may be added to isomalto-oligosacccharide composition to<br>
increase the bulk of the composition. Also, binders, such as, but not limited to,<br>
starch, gelatin, sucrose, glucose, dextrose, molasses, lactose, acacia gum,<br>
sodium alginate, extract of Irish moss, panwar gum, ghatti gum, mucilage of<br>
isapgol husks, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone,Veegurn and starch arabogalactan, polyethylene glycol,<br>
ethylcellulose, glycerylmonostearate and waxes, may be added to the<br>
formulation to increase its cohesive qualities.<br>
Additionally, lubricants, such as, but not limited to, glyceryl monostereate, talc,<br>
magnesium15 stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, hydrogenated vegetable<br><br>
oils, polyethylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride,<br>
leucine, carbowax, sodium laurylsulfate, and magnesium lauryl sulfate may be<br>
added to the formulation. Also, glidants, such as but not limited to, colloidal<br>
silicon dioxide, magnesium silicate or talc may be added to improve the flow<br>
characteristics of a powdered formulation. Finally, disintegrants, for example, but<br>
not limited to, starches, clays, celluloses, algins, gums, crosslinked polymers<br>
(e.g.,croscarmelose, crospovidone, and sodium starch glycolate), Veegum,<br>
methylcellulose, agar,benton:ite, cellulose and wood products, natural sponge,<br>
cation-exchange resins, alginicacid, guar gum, citrus pulp,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, or sodium lauryl sulfate with starchmay also be added<br>
to facilitate disintegration of the formulation in the stomach or intestine.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the use of the novel substrate,<br>
tuber or grain composition described herein in the production of flour for use in<br>
various baked goods. The term baked goods refers to leavened and unleavened<br>
goods. The term leavened refers to baked goods using yeast in the baking<br>
process. Whereas the term unleavened means baked goods not using yeast in<br>
the baking process. Exemplary goods include bread, cookies, cakes, pies,<br>
biscuits, naan, bagels, pasta, crackers, rolls, donuts, pitas and pastries.<br>
Exemplary unlevened goods include matzoh, chapathi, breakfast cereals and<br>
torillas. Another embodiment of the present invention is the use of the novel<br>

udon, etc.). Another embodiment of the present invention is a substrate, tuber<br>
or grain composition made according to the above described method. Another<br>

method. Another embodiment of the present invention is a substrate, tuber or<br>
grain composition made according to the above described method.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a substrate, tuber or grain<br>
composition made according to the above described method. Another<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention is the use of the novel grain compositions<br>
in fermentive/beer worts or substrates. For example, the novel grain<br>
composition can be used as described in beer fermentation as described in<br>
International Publication No WO 02/20712 A1, which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein. The novel grain compositions can also be incorporated in beer<br>
adjuncts.<br>
The isomalto-oligosaccharide containing substrate can also be subjected to an<br>
additional step of recovering the maltose by extraction and isolation of the<br>
generated maltose, for example as a maltose syrup. The syrup can be extracted<br>
and/or isolated from the grain composition by methods familiar in the art, for<br>
example in U.S.Pat. Nos. 3,922,196 and 4,113,509, which are incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
Another route to enhance the sweetness or the isomalto-oligosaccharide<br>
content, is to treat the produced isomalto-oligosaccharide syrup with a hydrolase<br>
(in soluble or immobilised form) which hydrolyses preferentially or even<br>
exclusively malto-oligosaccharides, and has only a small or even no affinity for<br>
isomalto-oligosaccharides. Examples of such an enzyme is glucoamylase from<br>
A. niqer or other sources like Aspergillus sp. or Rhizopus sp. which preferentially<br>
hydrolyses malto-oligosaccharides ( Manjunath P., Shenoy B. C, Raghavendra<br>
Rao M. R., Journal of Applied Biochemistry, 5(1983),235-260; Meagher M. M., et<br>
al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 34(1989), 681-693; Pazur J. H., Kleppe<br>
K., The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 237(4)(1962),1002-1006; Hiromi K.,<br>
Nitta Y., et al.,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 302(1973),362-37).<br>
Also an enzyme like the alpha-D-glucopyranosidase from Bacillus<br>
stearothermophilus can be applied. This enzyme is not capable of hydrolysing<br>
isomalto-oligosaccharides and will only degrade the malto-oligosaccharides<br>
present in the isomalto-oligosaccharide rich syrup (Suzuki Y., Shinji M.,<br>
Nobuyuki E., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 787(1984),281 -289). Also other<br>
alpha-D-glucosidases which are called maltases can be used. The maltase from<br>
yeast for example will only hydrolyse maltose and to a lesser extent maltotriose<br>
(Kelly C. T., Fogarty W. M., Process Biochemistry, May/June(1983),6-12).<br><br>
After the hydrolysis of the malto-oligosaccharides to glucose, the syrup can be<br>
enriched in isomalto-oligosaccharides by a chromatographic technique or by<br>
nano- or ultra-filtration.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the main embodiments of this<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following specific examples further illustrate the compositions and the<br>
methods of the invention. It is to be understood that these examples are for<br>
illustrative purposes only and can be applied to any other suitable materials rich<br>
in starch and containing endogenous maltose producing enzyme, for example,<br>
wheat, rice, barley, malt, potato, sweet potato, etc.<br>
Enzyme Activity Determination<br>
The transglucosidase activity is measured by the method of Shetty, J., et al,<br>
1986 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,575,487).<br>
The beta amylase activity was measured by a 30-minute hydrolysis of a starch<br>
substrate at pH 4.6 and 20° C. The reducing sugar groups produced on<br>
hydrolysis are measured in titrimetirc procedure using alkaline ferricyanide.<br>
One unit of diastase activity, expressed as degrees DP refers to the amount of<br>
enzyme, contained in 0.1 ml of 5% solution of the sample enzyme preparation,<br>
that will produce sufficient reducing sugars to reduce 5 mL of Fehlings' solution<br>
when the sample is incubated with 100 mL of the substrate for 1 hour at 20 C.<br>
The alpha amylase activity was developed based on an end-point assay kit<br>
supplied by Megazyme (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. A vial of substrate (p-nitrophenyl<br>
maltoheptaoside, BPNPG7) was dissolved in 10ml of sterile water followed by a<br>
1:4 dilution in assay buffer (50mM maleate buffer, pH 6.7, 5mM calcium chloride,<br>
0.002% Tween20). Assays were performed by adding 10µl of amylase to 790µl<br>
of the substrate in a cuvette at 25°C. Rates of hydrolysis were measured as the<br>
rate of change of absorbance at 41 Onm, after a delay of 75 seconds. The assay<br>
was linear up to rates of 0.2 absorption units/min.<br><br>
a-Amylase protein concentration was measured using the standard Bio-Rad<br>
Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) based on the method of Bradford, Anal. Biochem..<br>
Vol. 72, p. 248 (1976) using bovine serum albumin standards.<br>
Substrates:<br>
The wheat flour used as substrates in all examples, was purchased from retail<br>
commercial stores . Other tuber or grain substrates, e.g., rice and barley used<br>
as substrates may be purchased from commercial sources (Huai An Liujun Food<br>
processing company, Jiangshu province, China).<br>
Oligosaccharide Analysis<br>
The composition of the reaction products of oligosaccharides was measured by<br>
HPLC (Agilent 1010, Palo Alto, California, USA) equipped with a HPLC column<br>
(Rezex 8 u8% H, Monosaccharides), maintained at 60°C fitted with a refractive<br>
index (Rl) detector (ERC-7515A, Rl Detector from The Anspec Company, Inc.).<br>
Dilute sulfuric acid (0.01 N) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6<br>
ml per minute. Twenty microliter of 4.0% solution was injected on to the column.<br>
The column separates based on the molecular weight of the saccharides. For<br>
example a designation of DP1 is a monosacchride, such as glucose; a<br>
designation of DP2 is a disaccharide, such as maltose; a designation of DP3 is a<br>
trisaccharide, such as maltotriose and the designation DP4+ is an<br>
oligosaccharide having a degree of polymerization (DP) of 4 or greater. The<br>
term Higher sugar ("Hr. Sugar") refers to sugars having DP greater than 3.<br>
For iso-saccharides or branched sugars.the reaction products were measured by<br>
HPLC (Agilent 1010, Palo Alto, California, USA) equipped with a HPLC column<br>
(Shodex Rspak Oligosaccharide Column #DC-613), maintained at 50°C fitted<br>
with a refractive index (Rl) detector (ERC-7515A, Rl Detector from The Anspec<br>
Company, Inc.). 70 (Acetonitrile):25 (methanol):5 Water was used as the mobile<br>
phase at a flow rate of 2.5 ml per minute. Twenty microliter of 4.0% solution was<br>
injected on to the column. The column separates based on the molecular weight<br><br>
of the saccharides. The standard sugars, glucose, maltose, maltotriose,<br>
isomaltose, panose and isomalto-triose (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Missouri,<br>
USA) were used to calibrate the column.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Maltose production from wheat flour by alpha amylase from Bacillus<br>
licheniformis (an alpha amylase sold under the tradename GC262SP by<br>
Genencor International, Palo Alto, CA) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (an<br>
alpha amylase sold under the tradename GC007 by Genencor International,<br>
Palo Alto, CA) were compared. One hundred fifty grams of wheat flour from<br>
commercial retail sources was suspended in 450 ml of deionized water. The<br>
suspension was stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature for uniform mixing<br>
(pH 5.5). The pH was adjusted with 6.0 N sulphuric acid (H2SO4). The resultant<br>
suspension was kept in a water bath maintained at 60° C and stirred for uniform<br>
mixing before the enzymes were added.. About 6,000 LU/g of amylase from<br>
Bacillus stearothermophilus (0.6 kg of GC007 [from Genencor International.<br>
Inc.]/Metric ton (Mt) starch dsb) and 15,100 LU/g of amylase from Bacillus<br>
licheniformis (0.6 kg GC262 SP from [Genencor International. Inc.]/Mt. starch<br>
dsb) were added separately and incubated with constant stirring at 60° C .<br>
Samples were withdrawn at different predetermined intervals of time and<br>
analyzed for total sugar composition using high-pressure liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC). Two ml of sample was taken from each container at a predetermined<br>
time interval using a plastic pipette and transferred to a centrifuge tube. The<br>
sample was centrifuged at 8000 prm for 3 minutes. The supernatent was<br>
withdrawn from the centrifuge tube and a few drops were placed into a sample<br>
well of a Lecia AR200 (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA) digital hand<br>
held refractometer and recorded (Table 2). The Brix (as a measure of the<br>
dissolved sugars) of the solution was determined (Table 2).<br>
Table 2<br><br><br>
The results in the table 2 showed that wheat flour incubated with alpha amylase<br>
from Bacillus stearothermophilus gave a higher maltose content compared to the<br>
maltose content from the incubation with alpha amylase from Bacillus<br>
licheniformis. Incubation of wheat flour with alpha amylases resulted in a<br>
significant increase in the dissolved solids due to the hydrolysis of the granular<br>
starch compared to incubation of wheat flour without alpha amylase addition. It<br>
is interesting to note here that the reaction product of alpha amylase from<br>
Bacillus stearothermophilus resulted in a higher ratio of maltose to glucose and<br>
maltose to maltotriose compared to alpha amylase from Bacillus licheniformis.<br>
These results indicate that the alpha amylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus<br>
is an especially useful enzyme for producing very high maltose syrup.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Effect of Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha amylase (alpha amylase sold under<br>
the tradename GC 007by Genencor International, Palo Alto, CA) concentration<br>
on the maltose production during incubation with wheat flour. The experimental<br>
conditions were identical as explained in Example 1. In addition, Bacillus<br>
stearothermophilus (6,000 Units/g) was added at 0.1 Kg, 0.2 Kg and 0.6 Kg /MT<br>
of starch dsb. The results are summarized in table 3.<br>
Table 3<br>
Effect of Alpha Amylase [GC007] Concentration on Maltose Yield during<br>
incubation of wheat flour, pH 5.5, 60° C<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
One hundred fifty grams of wheat flour was suspended in 450 ml of deionized<br>
water and the pH was adjusted to pH 5.00, 4.50 and 4.00 using 6.0 N H2S04.<br>
The slurry was stirred well for uniform mixing and the pH was adjusted until the<br>
specified pH was stabilized. GC007 was added at 0.1 Kgs/MT, starch dsb to<br>
each of the trial and incubated at 60° C. The samples were withdrawn at<br>
different predetermined intervals of time and the composition of the sugar and<br>
brix were measured as described in Example 1. (Table 4).<br><br>
The maltose content increased with decreasing pH of the incubation of the<br>
wheat flour from pH 5.5 and reached maximum of about 68% at pH 4.5 followed<br>
by a decrease at pH 4.0. This is an unexpected result showing the production of<br>
maltose content greater than 60 % without the addition of a debranching enzyme<br>
during the hydrolysis of starch with plant beta amylases. The hydrolysis of<br>
liquefied starch by commercial Beta amylases (barley or wheat) generally<br><br>
produces maltose content between 55% and 60 %. For maltose content greater<br>
than 60 % using liquefied starch, the addition of debranching enzyme and or a<br>
very low starting DE of the liquefied starch are required. It is also important to<br>
note here that the process described in this invention allows maltose<br>
manufacturers to process at pH 4.5 and 60° C that reduces the high risk of<br>
microbial contamination of the current process.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
One hundred fifty grams of wheat flour was suspended in 450 ml of deionized<br>
water and the pH of the slurry was adjusted to pH 4.5. The slurry was stirred<br>
well for uniform mixing and the pH was adjusted with 6.0 N H2SO4 until the pH<br>
was stabilized. The resultant suspension was kept in a water bath maintained at<br>
60° C and stirred for uniform mixing before the enzymes were added. A starch<br>
liquefying enzyme, e.g., a Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha amylase sold under<br>
the tradename "GC 007" (Genencor International, Inc.) was added at 0.1 Kg/MT,<br>
dsb. A debranching enzyme, a pullulanase sold under the tradename OPTIMAX<br>
L-1000 (Genencor International, Inc.) was then added at 0.25 Kg, 0.5 Kg and 1.0<br>
Kg/M T dsb and incubated at 60° C. The samples were withdrawn at<br>
predetermined different intervals of time (2, 4, 6 and 24 hours) and the<br>
composition of the sugar and brix were measured as described in Example 1.<br>
The results were recorded (Table 5).<br><br><br><br>
Maltogenic enzymes (such as beta amylases) or starch liquefying alpha<br>
amylases (such as GC007) can not hydrolyze the alpha 1-6 glucosidic linkages,<br>
the branch point in the amylopectin of the starch substrate. So it is a common<br>
practice to add debranching enzyme, pullulanase (OPTIMAX L-1000 from<br>
Genencor International Inc) for producing maltose greater than 65 % during the<br>
incubation of starch substrate with beta amylase. The effect of OPTIMAX L-1000<br>
concentration during the incubation of wheat flour with GC007 was studied and<br>
the results were shown in Table 5. OPTIMAX L-1000 addition resulted in a<br>
significantly higher level (&gt;75 %) of maltose (DP2) compared to the control.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
It is generally the common practice in the industry to use high maltose<br>
syrup produced by an enzymatic process using a high temperature (&gt;90° C)<br>
enzyme liquefied starch substrate followed by treating with enzyme<br>
glucosyltransferase for producing isomalto-oligosaccharides syrups. This<br>
example illustrates the process of converting the granular starch in the wheat<br>
flour into isomalto-oligosaccahrides in a single step. In this example, 275 grams<br>
of wheat flour was placed in a flask and 688 ml of deionized water was added. It<br>
was then stirred for 15 minutes for uniform mixing and the pH was then adjusted<br>
to pH 4.5 using 6.0 N H2SO4. The resultant suspension was kept in a water bath<br>
maintained at 60 C and stirred for uniform mixing before the enzymes were<br><br>
added. A starch liquefying enzyme, e.g., Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha<br>
amylase ([GC007 supplied by Genencor International] (0.1 Kgs /MT dsb) and a<br>
debranching enzyme, e.g., a pullulanase (OPTIMAX L-1000 supplied by<br>
Genencor International) (0.5 kgs/MT dsb) were added. The suspension was then<br>
divided into two equal parts. To one of the parts, an Aspergillus niqer<br>
transglucosidase sold under the tradename TRANSGLUCOSIDASE L-500"<br>
(Genencor International) was added at 1.0 Kg/MT dsb and kept in a wafer bath<br>
maintained at 60° C (Sample1). The other part was incubated first for four hours<br>
at 60°, followed by the addition of Aspergillus niaer transglucosidase sold under<br>
the tradename "TRANSGLUCOSIDASE L-500" (Genencor International) at 1.0<br>
Kg/MT dsb and maintenance in a water bath maintained at 60° C (Sample 2).<br>
The results shown in Table 6 indicate that conversion of the substrate to IMO's<br>
occurs with or without preincubation of the substrate (wheat flour) prior to the<br>
addition of the transglucosidase.<br><br><br><br>
Incubation of modified wheat flour containing high content of maltose with<br>
Translucosidase produced isomalto-oligosaccharides identical to the<br>
composition produced by the conventional process. The process is simple,<br>
economical and can be easily scaled to commercial production<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
It is common knowledge that cereals like wheat, barley and rye contain<br>
high levels of beta-amylase. Incubation of these cereals at 55°-60° C, pH 5.5<br>
generally results in syrups containing greater than 50% maltose. A 28%<br>
slurry of wheat, barley and rye flour, respectively, was each prepared by<br>
adding 280 grams of the respective flour to 720 gm of deionized water. To<br>
each of these preparations, a Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha amylase<br>
(e.g., a Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha amylase sold under the trademark<br>
"GC007" by Genencor International) was added at 0.2 kg/MT of the flour. The<br>
pH was then adjusted to pH 5.5 using 6.0 N H2SO4 and incubated at 60° C for<br>
4.5 hours. The pH of the incubated samples was then adjusted to pH 4.5<br>
using 6 N H2SO4 and 1.25 kg of transglulcosidase (e.g., a transglucosidase<br>
sold under the tradename TRANSGLUCOSIDASE L-500 by Genencor<br>
International) / MT of the flour was added. The slurries were then incubated<br>
at 60° C water bath for 48 hours. The samples were then centrifuged and<br>
analyzed for I MO composition (Table 7) as set forth in Example 1.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
In an experiment, 140 grams of malt (Cargill Malt/Schreier-Malting<br>
Company, Wisconsin, USA) was mixed with 360 grams of distilled water. The<br>
slurry was stirred for 15.0 minutes at room temperature for uniform mixing and<br>
pH was then adjusted to pH 4.5 using dilute acetic acid. After stabilization of<br>
the pH, the slurry was kept in a water bath maintained at 60° C. Incubation<br>
was continued for 30.0 minutes with constant stirring and a 2 ml sample was<br>
withdrawn for Brix and HPLC analysis (0, time). Transglucosidase L-500 was<br>
added at 1.5 kg/MT malt and incubated at 60° C. Samples were withdrawn at<br>
different predetermined intervals of time during incubation, e.g., 2, 4, 6,<br>
12,and 24 hours, to ascertain Brix and IMO composition (Table 8) as<br>
described in Example 1.<br><br><br><br>
The results in Table 8 showed that the commercial malt extract can be used<br>
as a suitable substrate for producing malt extract containing isomalto-<br>
oligosaccharides. The reaction time and the composition of IMO sugars of the<br>
malt extract could be adjusted by controlling the enzyme dosage. The<br>
addition of maltogenic enzymes can increase IMO content of the resulting<br>
composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 8: Sorghum, Millet and Rice (Exogenous Maltogenic enzymes)<br>
In another experiment, 280 grams of sorghum, millet and rice flour<br>
were each taken separately and mixed separately with 720 grams of<br>
deionized water. The pH of the suspension was adjusted to pH 5.5 and a<br>
Bacillus stearotherphilus alpha amylase sold under the trademark "GC007"<br>
(Genencor International) was added at 0.5 kg/mt of the flour. After uniform<br>
mixing, the suspension was kept in a water bath maintained at 75° C. The<br>
reaction mixture was continuously stirred during incubation for 6 hours. The<br>
temperature was then reduced to 60° C and a beta-amylase (sold under the<br>
tradename OPTIMALT BBA by Genencor International) was added at 1.0<br>
kg/mt of the flour. The incubation was continued for additional 10-15 hours (a<br>
sample was taken for Brix and HPLC). After the specified time, the pH was<br>
reduced to pH 4.5 by 6N H2SO4 and an Aspergillus niger transglucosidase<br>
(sold under the tradename "TRANSGLUCOSIDASE L-500" by Genencor<br>
International) was added at 1.0 kg/mt flour. Samples were taken at 24 and<br>
48 hrs. for analysis (Table 9).<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 9, IMO Numbers of 41 to 54 % (52.20, 53.03, 43.90, 41.19,<br>
54.40, and 51.25) were achieved.<br>
EXAMPLE 9: Mixed Grain/Cereals Composition<br>
The data in Example 5 for wheat and Example 6 for barley and rye showed<br>
considerable amount of endogeneous maltogenic enzyme activity resulting in a<br>
syrup containing very high maltose. On the other hand, grains known to not<br>
contain endogenous maltogenic enzymes, for example sorghum, millet and rice,<br>
required the addition of exogenous maltogenic enzyme for producing the<br>
substrate suitable for transglucosidase treatment. In this experiment we studied<br>
the supplementation of maltogenic enzyme containing cereals like wheat or<br>
barley with sorghum and rice for converting the starch to substrates containing<br>
high maltose levels. In a typical experiment, a 15% suspension of sorghum and<br>
rice was prepared by suspending 140 grams of the flour in 720 grams of<br>
deionized water. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.5 using 6 N H2SO4 and Bacillus<br>
sterarothermophilus alpha amylase sold under the trademark "GC007"<br>
(Genencor International) was added at 0.5 kg/mt of the flour. The resultant<br>
suspension was then left in a water bath maintained at 75° C. The suspension<br>
was stirred continuously for 6 hours. The temperature was then reduced to 60°<br>
C. Solid content of flour, e.g., pre-treated rice flour, was increased from 15% to<br>
30% by the addition of barley flour. Similarly, wheat was added to pre-treated<br>
sorghum to a final concentration to reach 30%. The incubation was then<br>
continued for an additional 10-12 hrs. at 60° C. The pH was reduced to 4.5 and<br>
TRANSGLUCOSIDASE L-500 was added at 1.0 kg/mt flour. The incubation at<br>
60° C was continued for 24 hours and 48 hours. The samples were taken for<br>
HPLC analysis and brix; the results are shown in Table 10.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 10 above, the mixtures of millet and barley; and rice and<br>
wheat resulted in 45 to 56 % IMO in the resultant suspension after the above<br>
described incubation periods.<br>
