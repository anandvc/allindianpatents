				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for producing a combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gas(es) and air/oxygen, yielding enhanced quantity of heat energy, for use in a burner for domestic purpose, or for industrial application, e.g. in cutting, welding, melting of metals and the like materials, to result in saving of fuel consumption. More specifically, this invention is concerned with a device which produces an easily ignitable composition by mixing a hydrocarbon or mixtures thereof, such as those present in liquefied petroleum gas, with a controlled volume of air or oxygen, said composition being capable of producing a substantially higher quantity of heat compared to what is achieved from the conventional burners, resulting in considerable saving of fuel consumption, and consequent economy.<br>
It is known that burning of hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof generate heat which could be used both for domestic as well as for industrial purposes. But, burning of hydrocarbons in air does not ensure complete combustion, whereby unburnt hydrocarbons and/or carbon particles result in noxious fumes and consequent loss in energy output. It has been found that if the hydrocarbon( s) or mixtures thereof are mixed with a controlled amount of air or oxygen, then enhanced quantum of heat may be obtained by burning the mixture.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
In this specification, unless otherwise specified, abbreviations like "L.P.G." and "mmwc" stand for "liquefied petroleum gas" and "millimeter Water column", respectively, the latter being used to denote the pressure of fluids.<br>
Heretofore hydrocarbons have been used both in the domestic as well as in the industrial fronts for producing heat by burning. With the advent of L.P.G., a sea-change in the style and manner of cooking has already taken place on the domestic front. However, on close observation it has been found that a considerable quantity of hydrocarbons emanating from a standard gas cylinder either goes unburnt or gets partially burnt resulting in unsatisfactory generation of heat, loss or wastage of fuel and consequent loss of money value.<br>
It has also been observed that certain low boiling hydrocarbons are kept under pressure in a container in a liquified form, as in a L.P.G. cylinder, and when allowed to escape through an orifice or nozzle it undergoes volume expansion due to a change from liquid to gaseous or vapour state. Conventionally, this expanded volume of gas burns in air in a burner where volume of air supply can be controlled only over a very limited range, by adjusting the openings of air inlet holes. This mechanism, though in vogue, has been found to be inadequate. Hence the need to find out an effective process for ensuring complete combustion of liquefied hydrocarbon gases,<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a device which will produce a combustible composition of hydrocarbon gases and air or oxygen, which in turn is capable of generating enhanced quantum of heat energy when ignited or burnt in any suitable appliance, either for domestic purpose or for industrial purpose, as aforesaid.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a device which ensures mixing of a hydrocarbon gas and air or oxygen in a predetermined proportion.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a device which ensures a steady supply of the combustible mixture for the purpose of generating greater amount of heat and consequent fuel saving.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a device which may be adapted to be connected to the domestic LPG cylinder - burner system, in order to generate more heat and save fuel to the tune of around 25%.<br>
The device according to this invention, as developed, may be marketed as a self-sufficient device, so that it can be adapted to be used in household gas-cooking systems to achieve fuel economy and utilise L.P.G. more effectively for a longer period of time.<br>
With the foregoing and other objects in view, the present<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a device for producing an energy efficient combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gases and air/oxygen, comprising a housing supporting a sealed mixing chamber having separate inlet means to feed therein air/oxygen under controlled pressure and hydrocarbon gases, such as hereindescribed, under controlled pressure, the inlet for the hydrocarbon gases and that for the air/oxygen being located in mutually perpendicular position in relation to one another, to ensure proper mixing of air/oxygen with hydrocarbon gases., said mixing chamber also provided with an outlet means for supply of energy efficient combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gases and air/oxygen in predetermined ratio from said mixing chamber for energy efficient combustion in a combustion means.<br>
Preferably, the inlet for the air /oxygen is adapted to be connected to a pump or compressor, provided/mounted within the housing , for introducing air/oxygen, under controlled pressure, into the mixing chamber.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the device the connecting line between the pump/compressor and the inlet provided in the mixing chamber for the air/oxygen ,is provided with a flow meter for regulating/controlling the pressure of the air/oxygen, as desired<br>
-5-<br><br>
Preferably, the connecting line between the pump/compressor and the inlet for the air/oxygen into the mixing chamber, is provided with an one-way valve for arresting back-flow of air/oxygen, in the event of the inoperative state of the pump/compressor.<br>
The pump/compressor may be electric ally/battery, or diesel/ kerosene - operated.<br>
Also preferably, the inlet for the hydrocarbon gas(es) is adapted to be connected to a source of hydrocarbon gas(es), e.g. LPG Cylinder, and the connecting line between the said source and the mixing chamber, is provided with a valve for controlling/regulating the pressure of the hydrocarbon gas(es).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the device the said outlet of the mixing chamber is adapted to be connected to a cooking burner for domestic use, or to an appropriate appliance, such as herein described, for industrial application of the combustible mixture of gases, formed in the mixing chamber, the connecting line from the said outlet being provided with a valve for controlling/regulating the pressure of the combustible mixture of gases, supplied from the mixing chamber.<br>
Preferably, the volume ratio of hydrocarbon gas(es) to air/ oxygen in the mixing chamber is adapted to be maintained 1:3, by means of the respective regulating/controlling valves.<br>
Preferably, the mixing chamber is a sealed one, made of non-inflammable sheet material, e.g. of steel,<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, hydrocarbons used for the purpose of this invention may be selected from a wide range of compounds the principal criteria being easy volatility and a low ignition/flash point. Hydrocarbons most widely used are L.P.G., coal gas, naphtha-cracker gases, etc. All these may conveniently be used as the starting materials for this invention, which will form readily ignitable compositions with air or oxygen. It is envisaged that the concept of the present invention may be extended to industrial applications also, e.g., for cutting, welding, melting of metals, alloys and the like materials. For the sake of convenience it is recommended to select hydrocarbons, either gaseous or low - boiling, volatile liquid having ignition/flash point not exceeding 50°C.<br>
The supply of air or oxygen may be made with the help of<br>
a compressor or pump. Normally such compressors or pumps<br>
are driven by electricity, but they may even be battery-driven,<br>
or driven by burning fuels like diesel or kerosene.<br>
The compressor or pump forces air or oxygen for mixing with hydrocarbons. The rate and volume of flow is controlled by a valve, optionally but preferable fitted with an one-way cock which will permit air or oxygen to flow but will prevent the back-flow of L.P.G. when the compressor is not working.<br>
The mixing of hydrocarbon( s) and air or oxygen is carried out in a sealed chamber having a plurality of openings. In fact,<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
there are normally three ports or openings which are fitted with nozzles of predetermined cross-section. Through one such nozzle usually located in the upper surface, L.P.G. is allowed to enter the sealed chamber, and compressed air or oxygen, normally three times the volume of L.P.G., is introduced through another nozzle serving as inlet for air located at the side of the said sealed chamber. The third opening of the sealed chamber serves as an outlet for the combustible mixture. To eliminate any possibility of a mishap, a suitable flash-back arrestor may also be included in the system.<br>
The material of construction for the sealed chamber should be such that it is machinable, capable of withstanding rough handling, not reacted upon readily by the ingredients and be reasonably priced. Mild steel is generally used as it nearly fulfils the foregoing criteria.<br>
The nature and scope of the invention can be better understood from the following description, set out by way of illustration but not by way of limitation, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein :-<br>
Fig.1 shows in a diagrammatic view, one embodiment of the device, according to the present invention, with the front lid thereof being removed for the purpose of showing the various features of the device; and Fig.2 is a pictorial representation of the<br>
embodiment of the device according to the<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
invention, as shown in Fig.1, as and when connected to a source of hydrocarbon gas, e.g. L.P.G. cylinder, and a burner used for domestic cooking.<br>
As shown in Fig.1, the particular embodiment of the device according to the invention comprises a housing (1), made/ fabricated out of sheet metal, wherein there are provided a compressor (2), which is adapted to be actuated by connecting the power line (2A) thereof to the mains supply (not shown). In operation, as and When the power line is connected to the Mains, the compressor (2) supplies air under controlled pressure through a pipe line (3). As shown, a flow meter (4) is mounted on the wall of the housing (1), the actuating knob (4A) of the flow meter being kept outside the housing (1) for proper operation of the flow meter (4), with a view to regulate/control the supply of air through the pipe line (3), which, as shown, is connected through an inlet nozzle (6) of a chamber (7) (hereinafter referred to as "mixing chamber" and which will be described in detail hereinafter). As shown, the pipe line for the supply of air under controlled pressure, regulated by the flow meter (4), passes through a gas-cock (5) acting as an one-way valve, the said gas-cock being also mounted on the base of the housing (1). Apart from the inlet nozzle (6) for the introduction of air, under controlled pressure into the mixing chamber (7), the latter has another inlet nozzle (8)<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
through which gaseous hydrocarbon (e.g. liquid petroleum gas) can be introduced through a pipe line (3'), which is connected to an inlet (9), provided at the wall/base of the housing (1). The mixing chamber (7) is made/fabricated out of sheet metal, and it is also provided with an outlet (10), the said outlet protruding from the base of the housing (1). The said mixing chamber (7) is otherwise kept totally sealed, so that, in operation, as and when air, under controlled pressure, is introduced through its inlet (6),and simultaneously, hydrocarbon gas (e.g, LPG) is introduced through the inlet nozzle (8), the combustion mixture of the hydrocarbon gas and air/oxygen, in predetermined ratio, maintained by actuating the respective valves/flow meters provided in the supply lines of the air/oxygen and the hydrocarbon gas, is adapted to be supplied through the outlet (10), and as shown in Fig.2, the said outlet (10) is connected to a domestic cooking burner (11), by means of a connecting pipe line (12). As further shown in Fig.2, the inlet nozzle (9) is for supply of hydrocarbon gas (e.g. LPG) from a LPG cylinder (13), by means of a connecting pipe line (14).<br>
The pipes, conduits and tubings used in the device of the present invention are made of durable, tough, yet resilient material, which do not enter into chemical reaction with either hydrocarbons or air/oxygen. The material in question should be substantially fire-proof. The pipes are usually made of<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
synthetic rubber, e.g., neoprene or chloroprene, although high density polyethylene, p.v.c. or polypropylene may also be used, and the tubes may optionally be metal-reinforced or "armoured".<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the Example given, which is given by way of illustration and hot by way of limitation. It is to be noted that the invention is not at all limited or restricted to the data given hereinbelow.<br>
Example<br>
The arrangement of the present invention leading to the production of a combustible gaseous mixture comprises a number of individual units like air compressor, controller, valve, mixing chamber, inlet and outlet nozzles, pipes, power connections, switches, lamp, etc., are housed in a metal box. The pertinent data are given below :<br>
a) Size of the metal box	- 8n x 7n x 4n<br>
b) (i) Outlet diameter of air-<br>
compressor	- 0°1 - 0°2 cm.<br>
(ii) air pressure	- 3mmwc.<br>
c)	(i) Sealed chamber for mixing<br>
gases	- 2"x2.5"x2"<br>
(ii) Max. pressure inside the<br>
chamber	- 350 - 400 mmwc.<br>
d)	Diameter of the delivery end of one-<br>
way gas cock for supply of<br>
air/oxygen	- 0°1" or 2°54 mm.<br>
e)	1/4" nozzle	- 2 Nos.<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
f) 1/8" nozzle	- (male &amp; female)<br>
g) 1/8" nozzle	- 2 Nos. one for air<br>
&amp; other for hydrocarbons)<br>
h) Gas flow controller	- 1 No.<br>
i) Switch	- 2 Nos. (one for<br>
compressor &amp; the other for indicator light)<br>
j)	Indicator lamp	- One<br>
k)	L.P.G. or similar gas container	- One<br>
1)	Burner	- One unit<br>
m)	Pipes, glands, clamps, nuts	- As may be necessary.<br>
In front of the metal box containing the aforesaid units, there are affixed two 1/4" nozzles, one for the entry of L.P.G. from the cylinder to the mixing chamber and the other serving as the outlet for the combustible mixture of hydrocarbons and air leading to a conventional L.P. gas stove.<br>
L.P.G. inlet into the mixing chamber is done by connecting the L.P.G. cylinder directly to the mixing chamber entry nozzle by means of suitable pipeline.<br>
The function of the air compressor commences on putting the switch 'on'. Air coming out of the compressor at a pressure of around 3 mmwc is passed through a 'controller', being the flow meter, as aforesaid, by means of which the air pressure is adjusted to about 1 mmwc. or less and this air is led<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
through the gas-cock which functions like an one-way valve. When the compressor is 'on', the gas-cock continues to pass air into the mixing chamber at a predetermined rate. When the compressor is switched "off', L.P.G. exerts pressure in the opposite direction, but cannot travel backwards because of the pressure of one-way gas-cock. The L.P.G. inlet nozzle and the air-inlet nozzle are located in mutually perpendicular position as shown in Fig.1 of the drawings and have similar dimensions, e.g. size 1/8" and internal diameter 0°1". The object of such disposition of nozzles on the mixing chamber is to ensure proper mixing of air with hydrocarbons. The pressure of L.P.G. inside the mixing chamber has been found to be 10 mmwc. and that of air as 5 mmwc. after mixing and storage inside the chamber. The pressure of the outgoing combustible gas mixture of air and hydrocarbon is around 15 mmwc. and this pressure works the burner satisfactorily, when the gas stove is 'on'. The maximum pressure of the combustible gas mixture inside the mixing chamber has been found to vary between 95 and 100 mmwc, provided the compressor is 'on', the regulator on the L.P.G. cylinder is set at 'one', and the oven is completely 'off' (and assuming that there is no leakage of gas whatsoever).<br>
The maximum storage pressure in the mixing chamber varies<br>
between 350 and 400 mmwc, and it is to be noted that entry<br>
of L.P.G. in the mixing chamber takes place directly and cannot be minimised. In the course of use if the power goes off,<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
the flame-intensity will hardly be affected as the L.P.G. line to the burner is connected directly to the LPG cylinder.<br>
For a satisfactory performance of the device of the present invention, it is recommended to take the following measures :<br>
(i)	Metal sheet of minimum 24-gauge thickness (preferably<br>
22-gauge) should be used in fabricating the mixing chamber and weldings must be done properly,<br>
(ii) Before commencing operation, tests are to be performed (e.g. aqua test) to ensure that there is no leakage in the entire system.<br>
(iii) Air supply should be balanced vis-a-vis L.P.G. supply to ensure a steady 3:1 proportion. Otherwise, flame quality may be affected.<br>
(iv) Pipe-joints, particularly in the one-way gas-cock, must be lubricated with good quality grease, to prevent the joints from going dry which may result in gas-leakage.<br>
It has been found that with satisfactory performance of the subject device, a LPG cylinder life is extended by about 25%, which is directly related to the fuel saving due to enhanced thermal efficiency of the combustible mixture.<br>
As already indicated, for the sake of additional safety, a suitable flash-back arrestor may be included in the present device to prevent combustible mixture to travel backwards through pipeline 3', particularly when the L.P.G. content is nearly exhausted.<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
The invention described, illustrated, exemplified and to be claimed hereinafter, also includes within its scope variations and/or equivalents, without deviating from the spirit of the invention.<br>
Having described the invention at length, it will be more particularly defined by the claims appended hereinafter.<br>
