				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hinge device for the door of a switchboard enclosure.<br>
Switchboard enclosures comprise a rear box fixabie to a vertical wall and capable of containing a plurality of e1ectrical switches . Attached to the box is a front cover having one or more one or more openings for access to the contro1 levres or pushbuttons of the electrical switches housed in the box. Along a vertical side of the box there are fixed two hinges forming pintles on which a door is rotatably mounted for c1osing the front of the enclosure. <br>
A general object of the present invention is to provide a hinge device capable of making the steps of assembling and disassembling the door of a switchboard enclosure safer and easior.<br>
A particular object of the invention is to provide a hinge devi ce that a 1 1 ows an ope ra tor to assemble and d.i sassemble a door in two phases, with an intermediate assembling or disassembling phase in which the door is secured to the enclosure provisional 1y but steadily enough to prevent the door from accidentally fa1ling while the operator is completing the locking or unLocking of the door.<br>
These and other objects and advantages, which will be understood more fully below, are achieved, in accordance with the present invention, by a hinge device having the features defined in claim 1 . According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a door for a switchboard enclosure as defined in claim 15. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br><br>
The features and advantages of the Invention will  emerge from the detai1ed description of an example of embodiment thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawings, provided by way of a non-limiting illustration, in which:<br>
figures 1 to 5 are perspective views showing the assembling steps of a hinge device according to the invention and a door on a switchboard enclosure;<br>
figure 6 is an exploded perspective view showing the front side of the hinge device and a fastening screw;<br>
figure 7 is a perspective view showing the rear side of the hinge device of 1igure 6; and<br>
figures 8 and 9 a partia1 cross sectional views of the end1osure where a hinge is fitted.<br>
With reference to the drawings, numeral 10indicates overall one of the two hinge devices fixable along a side of a front cover 30 of a switchboard enclosure for rotatably mounting a door 40. The cover 30 is removably fixable by moans of screw 50 to a rear box 34 (shown partially in figures 8 and 9) of the enclosure. the cover 30 typically has an opening 31 in. which there are 1ocated recessed panels 60 allowing access to the centro1s of the e1ectrical switches (not shown) housed in the one1osure.<br>
Throughout the description and the claims which follow, terms indicating positions and orientations, such as "front", "rear", "horizontal" and "vertical", must be understood from the view point of a person standing in the front of an electric switchboard mounted on a vertical wall.<br>
Each hinge device 10 (only one is shown in the drawings) comprises a body 11 of moulded plastic material forming a bush portion 12. rearwardly projecting with an inner cy1indrical non-threaded passage 13 that passes through the <br>
body 11 from side to side in the front rear direction. On its outside, the bush portion 12 forms a pair of angularly spaced L-shaped radial recesses 14 intended to cooperate with a respective pair of formations 32 (figure 1) radially projecting in a horizontal through bore 33 of the cover 30 . The hinge device 10 is coupled with the cover 30 by fitting the bush portion 12 in the bore 33, as indicated schematica1ly by arrows A and B in figure 1. The recesses 14 and projections 32 provided bayonet, coupling mechanism that a11ows to fix the hinge device 10 to the cover 30 quickly and removab1y.<br>
each hinge device 10 has two verticatlly aligned pintles 15, 16 on which the door 40 is rotatably mounted. One of the pintles, indicated l5, is a fixed pintle or pin formed integrally with the body 11, whereas the other pintle 16 is a mobile  element formed separately from the body 11 (figure 6) . The mobi1e pintle 16 comprises a vortical pin portion 17 and a locking 1ever 18 perpendicular to the pin 17 . The pintle 16 is sliding1y accommodated in the body 11 along a vertical axis x a1igned with the fixed pint1 e 15.<br>
The mobi1e pint1e 16 is inserted in a vertical guiding channel  19 formed by the body 11 (figure 6) and aligned with the axis x and a through bore 20 obtained in a side wall 21 of the body 11 . The pin 17 is inserted in snap manner in the guide 19, e1astica1ly forcing a tooth 22 that serves to hold the pin 17 along the quide 19. After insertion, the mobile pintle 16 is brought in a refracted position in which the end 17a of the pin 17 does not protrude out of the bore 20 (figure 2) .This position is determined by the abutment of the other end 17b of the pin against a stop 23.<br>
The door 40 is preliminarily coupled with the fixed pintle of each hinge device by a snap coupling (figure 3, arrow C)<br><br>
obtained by fitting the fixed pintle l5 in a fork formati on 41 of the door. A preliminarily assembled condition is so achieved (fiquro 4), in which a bore 42 of the door is axially adjacent, and a hingned with the bore 20 of each hinge and with the pin 17 refracted. By acting manually on the lever 18, the mobile pintles 16 are then forced to slide in the vertical direction indicated by arrow D in figure 4, the reby bringing the pins 17 i.n an extended position where they pass through both of the aligned bores 20 and 42. Sliding motion of the mobile pintle 16 with respect to the door 40 and the body 11 of the hinge are prevented by rotating the lever 18 about the axis x until the lever is locked between a pair of vertica11y spaced and elastically openab1e 1ocking teeth 25 (only one o f which is visible in the drawings ) . In this position ( figure 5 ) ,the teeth 25 hold the lever 18 so as to prevent the pintle 16 from sliding in the direction of axis x and thereby the door from accidentally coming off . The door is so secured steadi1y to each hinge device at two distinct points.<br>
In ordor to assemb1e a door, two hinge devices must first be mounted on the enclosure cover 30. Then the door 40 is pre1iminari1y coupled with each hinge device by making the forks 41 snap-engage the fixed pintles l5. It should be noted that in this condition (as shown in figure 4) the door is suspended to the enclosure but needs to be secured more steadily, because if it, were opened by rotating it more than 180° degrees from its closed posit ion, the forks 41 would be forcefully brought apart from one another and would come off the fixed pint1es 15 . However, the provisiona1ly secured condition of figure 4 a11ows the operator to complete closing the mobi1e pintles 16 safe1y enough for himself and the door, which will not fall unless it is opened too much, as said The same safety is attained upon disassembling the door. After un1ocking the mobile pintles 16 by making the levers 18 first rotate free of The locking teeth 25 and then withdrawing the ends 17a of the pins from the bores 42 of the door, the operator has both of his hands free to grab the door and remove if in snap manner of the fixed pintles l5.<br>
Referring final1y to figures 8 and 9, the horizontal bore 33 of the cover 30 is axially a ligned with the threaded bore 35 of the rear box 34. A screw 50 for fastening the cover 30 onto the box 34 ( figure 9) is fitted through the cylindricall passage 13 of the hinge and the non-threaded bore 33 of the cover and serewed in to the threaded bore 35. Upon unscrewing the serews 5O, the cover can be separated from the rear box. Owing to the bayonet coupling between the hinge and the cover, removal of the screws will not cause separation of the hinges, and therefore the door, from the cover 30. While carrying out this operation, the operator does not need to take care of ho1ding both the cover and the door to avoid that either or both may fa11 and get damaged. The door remains secured to the cover whereby if is sufficient to use one hand to take ho1d of either the cover or the door to prevent, both from fa11ing.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figures 8 and 9, the hinge body 11 forms an abutment surface 13a within the cy1indrleal passage 13 for the head 51 of the screw 50. Similarly, the two-diameter bore 33 has an abutment surface 36 for the rear or free end of the bush portion 12. When the screw 50 is tightly screwed in the threaded bore 35, the head 51 prevents the hinge device 10 from being accidenta1ly removed from the rest of the enclosure. Owing to the fact that the mechanism for coupling the hinge to the cover is formed integrally with these two parts, each hinge i s associated to on1y one screw. The smaller the number of screws, the less is the risk of 1osing one of them when the cover is disassembled. The coax-ia1 arrangement of the screw 50 with respect to the bush portion 12 an the bayonet, coupling mechanism allows the manufacturing of very compact hinge, having a body even much smaller than the one i1lustrated by way of example in the attached drawings.<br>
Furthermore, if will be appreciated that the provision of two pintles or securing points on each hinge device guarantees that the door will be steady also incase one of the two pintles (of plastic material ) is broken.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not limited to the em-bodiment described and illustrated here, which is to be considered as an examp1e of imp1ementing the hinge device. Rather, the invention is open to modifications concerning the shape and layout of parts, constructional details and materials used. In a further alternative embodiment (not shown), the quick coupling bayonet mechanism may be replaced by a different kind of quick coupling, preferably threaded. For example, the outer surface of the bush portion 12 may form a number of inclined ribs providing a thread for cooperating with corresponding radia1 reliefs formed in the cover bore 33. Proferab1y the inclination of the ribs wi11 be chosen such that the hinge body is fixab1e to the cover by rotating it a fraction of a furn, typically one fourth turn.<br><br><br>
