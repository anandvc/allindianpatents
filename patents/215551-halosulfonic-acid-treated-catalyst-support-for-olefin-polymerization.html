				<td>HALOSULFONIC ACID TREATED CATALYST SUPPORT FOR OLEFIN<br>
POLYMERIZATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to catalyst supports which are used for olefin<br>
polymerizations, especially ethylene polymerization.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The use of an aluminoxane as a cocatalyst for ethylene<br>
polymerization catalyst was reported by Manyik et al in United States<br>
Patent (USP) 3,231,550.<br>
Subsequently, Kamisky and Sinn discovered that aluminoxanes are<br>
excellent cocatalysts for metallocene catalysts, as disclosed in USP<br>
4,404,344.<br>
The use of a supported aluminoxane/metallocene catalyst is further<br>
described in, for example, USP 4,808,561.<br>
Hlatky and Turner disclosed the activation of bis-cyclopentadienyl<br>
metallocene catalysts with boron activators in USP 5,198,401.<br>
We have now discovered that the use of a metal oxide support<br>
which has been treated with a halosulfonic acid improves the productivity<br>
of group 4 metal catalysts which are activated with an aluminoxane or a<br>
boron activator.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a catalyst<br>
support for olefin polymerization comprising:<br>
1) a treated metal oxide support which is prepared by<br>
contacting a particulate metal oxide support with a halosulfonic acid; and<br>
2) an activator selected from the group consisting of an<br>
aluminoxane and a boron activator, wherein said activator is deposited<br>
upon said treated metal oxide support.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention also provides a<br>
supported olefin polymerization catalyst comprising the above defined<br>
catalyst support and a group 4 metal catalyst.<br>
The present invention further provides a process to prepare<br>
polyolefins using the catalyst technology of this invention. In a highly<br>
preferred embodiment, the group 4 metal catalyst is a phosphinimine<br>
catalyst.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The use of metal oxide supports in the preparation of olefin<br>
polymerization catalysts is known to those skilled in the art. An exemplary<br>
list of suitable metal oxides includes oxides of aluminum, silicon,<br>
zirconium, zinc and titanium. Alumina, silica and silica-alumina are metal<br>
oxides which are well known for use in olefin polymerization catalysts and<br>
are preferred for reasons of cost and convenience. Silica is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
The metal oxide may be calcined using conventional calcining<br>
conditions (such as temperatures of from 200 to 800°C for time periods of<br>
from 20 minutes to 12 hours).<br>
It is preferred that the metal oxide have a particle size of from about<br>
1 to about 200 microns. It is especially preferred that the particle size be<br>
between about 30 and 100 microns if the catalyst is to be used in a gas<br>
phase or slurry polymerization process and that a smaller particle size<br>
(less than 10 microns) be used if the catalyst is used in a solution<br>
polymerization.<br>
Conventional porous metal oxides which have comparatively high<br>
surface areas (greater than 1 m2/g, particularly greater than 100 m2/g,<br>
more particularly greater than 200 m2/g) are preferred to non-porous metal<br>
oxides.<br>
The treated metal oxides used in this invention are prepared by<br>
directly treating the metal oxide with a halosulfonic acid such as<br>
chlorosulfonic acid or fluorosulfonic acid. Fluorosulfonic acid is readily<br>
available and the use thereof is preferred.<br>
Activators<br>
The activator used in this invention is selected from 1)<br>
aluminoxanes; and 2) boron activators. It is preferred to use an<br>
aluminoxane. Descriptions of suitable activators are provided below.<br>
Aluminoxanes are readily available items of commerce which are<br>
known to be cocatalysts for olefin polymerization catalysts (especially<br>
group 4 metal metallocene catalysts). A generally accepted formula to<br>
represent aluminoxanes is:<br>
(R)2AIO(RAIO)mAI(R)2<br>
wherein each R is independently an alkyl group having from 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms and m is between 0 and about 50. The preferred aluminoxane is<br>
methylaluminoxane wherein R is predominantly methyl. Commercially<br>
available methylaluminoxane ("MAO") and "modified MAO" are preferred<br>
for use in this invention. [Note: In "modified MAO", the R groups of the<br>
above formula are predominantly methyl but a small fraction of the R<br>
groups are higher hydrocarbyls - such as ethyl, butyl or octyl - so as to<br>
improve the solubility of the "modified MAO" in aliphatic solvents.]<br>
The halosulfonic acid-treated metal oxide and aluminoxane are<br>
contacted together to form a catalyst support according to this invention.<br>
This is preferably done using conventional techniques such as mixing the<br>
aluminoxane and treated metal oxide together in an aliphatic or aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon (such as hexane or toluene) at a temperature of from 10 to<br>
200°C for a time of from 1 minute to several hours. The amount of<br>
aluminoxane is preferably sufficient to provide from 1 to 40 weight %<br>
aluminoxane (based on the combined weight of the aluminoxane and the<br>
treated metal oxide).<br>
Boron Activators<br>
As used herein, the term "boron activator" refers to both boranes<br>
and borate salts which function as activators for olefin polymerization<br>
catalysts. These activators are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The boranes may be generally described by the formula<br>
B(L)3<br>
wherein B is boron and each L is independently a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted hydrocarbyl ligand. Preferred examples of the ligand L<br>
include phenyl, alkyl substituted phenyl and halogen-substituted phenyl<br>
with perfluorophenyl being particularly preferred.<br>
The borates may be generally described by the formula<br>
[A] [B(L)4]<br>
wherein B is boron and each of the four L ligands is as described above;<br>
and<br>
[A] is a carbonium, oxonium, sulfonium or anilinium component of the<br>
borate salt. Specific examples of boron activators include:<br>
triethylammonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
tripropylammonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
trimethylammonium tetra(p-tolyl)boron,<br>
trimethylammonium tetra(o-tolyl)boron,<br>
tributylammonium tetra(pentafluorophenyl)boron,<br>
tripropylammonium tetra(o,p-dimethylphenyl)boron,<br>
tributylammonium tetra(m,m-dimethylphenyl)boron,<br>
tributylammonium tetra(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)boron,<br>
tributylammonium tetra(pentafluorophenyl)boron,<br>
tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetra(o-tolyl)boron,<br>
N,N-dimethylanilinium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
N,N-diethylanilinium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
N,N-diethylanilinium tetra(phenyl)n-butylboron,<br>
N,N-2,4,6-pentamethylanilinium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
di-(isopropyl)ammonium tetra(pentafluorophenyl)boron,<br>
dicyclohexylammonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
triphenylphosphonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
tri(methylphenyl)phosphonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
tri(dimethylphenyl)phosphonium tetra(phenyl)boron,<br>
tropillium tetrakispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
triphenylmethylium tetrakispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
benzene (diazonium) tetrakispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
tropillium phenyltrispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
triphenylmethylium phenyltrispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
benzene (diazonium) phenyltrispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
tropillium tetrakis (2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl) borate,<br>
triphenylmethylium tetrakis (2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl) borate,<br>
benzene (diazonium) tetrakis (3,4,5-trifluorophenyl) borate,<br>
tropillium tetrakis (3,4,5-trifluorophenyl) borate,<br>
benzene (diazonium) tetrakis (3,4,5-trifluorophenyl) borate,<br>
tropillium tetrakis (1,2,2-trifluoroethenyl) borate,<br>
triphenylmethylium tetrakis (1,2,2-trifluoroethenyl) borate,<br>
benzene (diazonium) tetrakis (1,2,2-trifluoroethenyl) borate,<br>
tropillium tetrakis (2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl) borate,<br>
triphenylmethylium tetrakis (2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl) borate, and<br>
benzene (diazonium) tetrakis (2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
Readily commercially available ionic activators include:<br>
N,N- dimethylaniliniumtetrakispentafluorophenyl borate,<br>
triphenylmethylium tetrakispentafluorophenyl borate, and<br>
trispentafluorophenyl borane.<br>
The boron activator is preferably used in an equimolar ratio with<br>
respect to the transition metal in the catalyst molecule (e.g. if the catalyst<br>
is an organometallic complex of titanium, then the B:Ti mole ratio is 1)<br>
although the boron activator may be used in lower amounts or in molar<br>
excess.<br>
It is also permissible to use a mixture of a boron activation and an<br>
aluminoxane.<br>
The metal oxide is preferably (but optionally) also treated with a<br>
metal alkyl compound.<br>
As used herein, the term metal alkyl compound is referred to a<br>
metal alkyl which may react with surface hydroxyl groups on the preferred<br>
silica or alumina supports.<br>
Examples including aluminum, zinc or magnesium complexes<br>
having an active alkyl group. Zinc alkyls and magnesium alkyls fall within<br>
the scope of this definition as do aluminum complexes which are defined<br>
by the formula:<br>
AI(R)a(OR)b(X)c<br>
Aluminum alkyls (such as tri-isobutyl aluminum) are particularly<br>
preferred for resins of cost and convenience. Mixtures of different alkyls<br>
such as a mixture of an aluminum alkyl and a magnesium alkyl may also<br>
be employed.<br>
The metal oxide may also (optionally) be treated with a bulky<br>
amine. As used herein, the term bulky amine refers to an amine having at<br>
least one substituent which is bulkier than a methyl group. Readily<br>
available amines such as phenyl dimethyl amine (PhNMe2) are preferred.<br>
The resulting catalyst support is suitable for use in olefin<br>
polymerization reactions when combined with a polymerization catalyst.<br>
Any polymerization catalyst which is activated by an aluminoxane may be<br>
employed. Exemplary catalysts include olefin polymerization catalysts<br>
which contain group 4 metals (such as Ti, Hf or Zr), group 5 metals<br>
(especially V), Fe, Cr and Pd. Preferred catalysts contain a group 4 metal.<br>
It is especially preferred to provide an AI:M mole ratio of from 10:1 to<br>
200:1, especially 50:1 to 150:1 in the finished catalyst complex (where Al<br>
is the aluminum provided by the aluminoxane and M is the group 4 metal).<br>
The catalyst support (i.e. the treated metal oxide/aluminoxane) may be<br>
combined with the polymerization catalyst using techniques which are<br>
conventionally used to prepare supported alurninoxane/metallocene<br>
catalysts. Such techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. In<br>
general, a hydrocarbon slurry of the catalyst support may be contacted<br>
with the catalyst complex. It is preferred to use a hydrocarbon in which the<br>
catalyst complex is soluble. The examples illustrate suitable techniques to<br>
prepare the supported catalyst of this invention. Particularly preferred<br>
catalysts are group 4 metal catalysts defined by the formula:<br>
wherein M is selected from titanium, hafnium and zirconium; L1 and L2 are<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadienyl,<br>
substituted cyclopentadienyl (including indenyl and fluorenyl) and<br>
heteroatom ligands, with the proviso that L1 and L2 may optionally be<br>
bridged together so as to form a bidentate ligand; L3 (each occurrence) is<br>
an activatable ligand and n is 1 or 2. It is preferred that n=2 (i.e. that there<br>
are 2 monoanionic activatable ligands).<br>
As previously noted, each of L1 and L2 may independently be a<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand or a heteroatom ligand. Preferred catalysts<br>
include metallocenes (where both L1 and L2 are cyclopentadienyl ligands<br>
which may be substituted and/or bridged) and monocyclopentadienyl-<br>
heteroatom catalysts (especially a catalyst having a cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligand and a phosphinimine ligand), as illustrated in the Examples.<br>
Brief descriptions of exemplary ligands are provided below.<br>
Cyclopentadienyl Ligands<br>
L1 and L2 may each independently be a cyclopentadienyl ligand. As<br>
used herein, the term "cyclopentadienyl ligand" is meant to convey its<br>
broad meaning, namely a substituted or unsubstituted ligand having a five<br>
carbon ring which is bonded to the metal via eta-5 bonding. Thus, the<br>
term cyclopentadienyl includes unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, substituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted indenyl, substituted indenyl, unsubstituted<br>
fluorenyl and substituted fluorenyl. An exemplary list of substituents for a<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand includes the group consisting of 1) C1-10<br>
hydrocarbyl radical (which hydrocarbyl substituents may be further<br>
substituted); 2) a halogen atom; 3) a C1-8 alkoxy radical; 4) a C6-10 aryl or<br>
aryloxy radical; 5) an amido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted<br>
by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; 6) a phosphido radical which is<br>
unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; 7) silyl radicals<br>
of the formula -Si-(RX)3 wherein each Rx is independently selected from<br>
the group consisting of hydrogen, a C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical C6-10 aryl or<br>
aryloxy radicals; 8) germanyl radicals of the formula Ge-(RY)3 wherein Rx<br>
is as defined directly above.<br>
Activatable Liaands<br>
L3 is an activatable ligand. The term "activatable ligand" refers to a<br>
ligand which may be activated by a cocatalyst or "activator" (e.g. the<br>
aluminoxane) to facilitate olefin polymerization. Exemplary activatable<br>
ligands are independently selected from the group consisting of a<br>
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-10 hydrocarbyl radical, a C1-10 alkoxy<br>
radical, a C5.10 aryl oxide radical; each of which said hydrocarbyl, alkoxy,<br>
and aryl oxide radicals may be unsubstituted by or further substituted by a<br>
halogen atom, a C1-8 alkyl radical, a C1-8 alkoxy radical, a C6-10 aryl or<br>
aryloxy radical, an amido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by<br>
up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; a phosphido radical which is unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals.<br>
The number of activatable ligands depends upon the valency of the<br>
metal and the valency of the activatable ligand. As previously noted, the<br>
preferred catalysts contain a group 4 metal in the highest oxidation state<br>
(i.e. 4+) and the preferred activatable ligands are monoanionic (such as a<br>
halide - especially chloride, or an alkyl - especially methyl). Thus, the<br>
preferred catalyst contains two activatable ligands. In some instances, the<br>
metal of the catalyst component may not be in the highest oxidation state.<br>
For example, a titanium (III) component would contain only one activatable<br>
ligand. Also, it is permitted to use a dianionic activatable ligand although<br>
this is not preferred.<br>
Heteroatom Ligands<br>
As used herein, the term "heteroatom ligand" refers to a ligand<br>
which contains a heteroatom selected from the group consisting of<br>
nitrogen, boron, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. The ligand may be sigma<br>
or pi bonded to the metal. Exemplary heteroatom ligands include<br>
phosphinimine ligands, ketimide ligands, siloxy ligands amido ligands,<br>
alkoxy ligands, boron heterocyclic ligands and phosphole ligands. Brief<br>
descriptions of such ligands follow:<br>
Phosphinimine Ligands<br>
Phosphinimine ligands are defined by the formula:<br>
wherein each R1 is independently selected from the group consisting of 1)<br>
a hydrogen atom; 2) a halogen atom; 3) C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals which<br>
are either unsubstituted or substituted by a halogen atom; 4) a C1-8 alkoxy<br>
radical; 5) a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical; 6) an amido radical; 7) a silyl<br>
radical of the formula:<br>
-Si-(R2)3<br>
wherein each R2 is independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, a C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical, C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radicals; and<br>
8) a germanyl radical of the formula:<br>
Ge-(R2)3<br>
wherein R2 is as defined above.<br>
The preferred phosphinimines are those in which each R1 is a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical. A particularly preferred phosphinimine is tri-(tertiary<br>
butyl) phosphinimine (i.e. where each R1 is a tertiary butyl group).<br>
Ketimide Ligands<br>
As used herein, the term "ketimide ligand" refers to a ligand which:<br>
(a) is bonded to the group 4 metal via a metal-nitrogen atom<br>
bond;<br>
(b) has a single substituent on the nitrogen atom, (where this<br>
single substituent is a carbon atom which is doubly bonded to the N atom);<br>
and<br>
(c) has two substituents (Sub 1 and Sub 2, described below)<br>
which are bonded to the carbon atom.<br>
Conditions a, b, and c are illustrated below:<br>
The substituents "Sub 1" and "Sub 2" may be the same or different.<br>
Exemplary substituents include hydrocarbyls having from 1 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms; silyl groups, amido groups and phosphido groups. For reasons of<br>
cost and convenience it is preferred that these substituents both be<br>
hydrocarbyls, especially simple alkyls and most preferably tertiary butyl.<br>
Siloxy Heteroligands<br>
These ligands are defined by the formula:<br>
- (µ)SiRxRyRz<br>
where the - denotes a bond to the transition metal and µ is sulfur or<br>
oxygen.<br>
The substituents on the Si atom, namely Rx, Ry and Rz are required<br>
in order to satisfy the bonding orbital of the Si atom. The use of any<br>
particular substituent Rx, Ry or Rz is not especially important to the<br>
success of this invention. It is preferred that each of Rx, Ry and Rz is a C1-4<br>
hydrocarbyl group such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or tertiary butyl (simply<br>
because such materials are readily synthesized from commercially<br>
available materials).<br>
Amido Ligands<br>
The term "amido" is meant to convey its broad, conventional<br>
meaning. Thus, these ligands are characterized by (a) a metal-nitrogen<br>
bond, and (b) the presence of two substituents (which are typically simple<br>
alkyl or silyl groups) on the nitrogen atom.<br>
Alkoxy Ligands<br>
The term "alkoxy" is also intended to convey its conventional<br>
meaning. Thus these ligands are characterized by (a) a metal oxygen<br>
bond, and (b) the presence of a hydrocarbyl group bonded to the oxygen<br>
atom. The hydrocarbyl group may be a ring structure and/or substituted<br>
(e.g. 2, 6 di-tertiary butyl phenoxy).<br>
Boron Heterocvclic Ligands<br>
These ligands are characterized by the presence of a boron atom in<br>
a closed ring ligand. This definition includes heterocyclic ligands which<br>
also contain a nitrogen atom in the ring. These ligands are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art of olefin polymerization and are fully described in<br>
the literature (see, for example, USP"s 5,637,659; 5,554,775 and the<br>
references cited therein).<br>
Phosphole Liaands<br>
The term "phosphole" is also meant to convey its conventional<br>
meaning. "Phosphole" is also meant to convey its conventional meaning.<br>
"Phospholes" are cyclic dienyl structures having four carbon atoms and<br>
one phosphorus atom in the closed ring. The simplest phosphole is C4PH4<br>
(which is analogous to cyclopentadiene with one carbon in the ring being<br>
replaced by phosphorus). The phosphole ligands may be substituted with,<br>
for example, C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals (which may, optionally, contain<br>
halogen substituents); phosphido radicals; amido radicals; silyl or alkoxy<br>
radicals.<br>
Phosphole ligands are also well known to those skilled in the art of<br>
olefin polymerization and are described as such in USP 5,434,116 (Sone,<br>
to Tosoh).<br>
Polymerization Processes<br>
This invention is suitable for use in any conventional olefin<br>
polymerization process, such as the so-called "gas phase", "slurry", "high<br>
pressure" or "solution" polymerization processes. Polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene and ethylene propylene elastomers are examples of olefin<br>
polymers which may be produced according to this invention.<br>
The preferred polymerization process according to this invention<br>
uses ethylene and may include other monomers which are<br>
copolymerizable therewith such as other alpha olefins (having from three<br>
to ten carbon atoms, preferably butene, hexene or octene) and, under<br>
certain conditions, dienes such as hexadiene isomers, vinyl aromatic<br>
monomers such as styrene or cyclic olefin monomers such as norbornene.<br>
The present invention may also be used to prepare elastomeric co-<br>
and terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and optionally one or more diene<br>
monomers. Generally, such elastomeric polymers will contain about 50 to<br>
abut 75 weight % ethylene, preferably about 50 to 60 weight % ethylene<br>
and correspondingly from 50 to 25% of propylene. A portion of the<br>
monomers, typically the propylene monomer, may be replaced by a<br>
conjugated diolefin. The diolefin may be present in amounts up to 10<br>
weight % of the polymer although typically is present in amounts from<br>
about 3 to 5 weight %. The resulting polymer may have a composition<br>
comprising from 40 to 75 weight % of ethylene, from 50 to 15 weight % of<br>
propylene and up to 10 weight % of a diene monomer to provide 100<br>
weight % of the polymer. Preferred but not limiting examples of the dienes<br>
are dicyclopentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-<br>
ethylidene-2-norbornene and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene. Particularly preferred<br>
dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene and 1,4-hexadiene.<br>
The polyethylene polymers which may be prepared in accordance<br>
with the present invention typically comprise not less than 60, preferably<br>
not less than 70 weight % of ethylene and the balance one or more C4-10<br>
alpha olefins, preferably selected from the group consisting of 1-butene, 1-<br>
hexene and 1-octene. The polyethylene prepared in accordance with the<br>
present invention may be linear low density polyethylene having density<br>
from about 0.910 to 0.935 g/cc. The present invention might also be<br>
useful to prepare polyethylene having a density below 0.910 g/cc, the so-<br>
called very low and ultra low density polyethylenes.<br>
The catalyst of this invention is preferably used in a slurry<br>
polymerization process or a gas phase polymerization process.<br>
A typical slurry polymerization process uses total reactor pressures<br>
of up to about 50 bars and reactor temperature of up to about 200°C. The<br>
process employs a liquid medium (e.g. an aromatic such as toluene or an<br>
alkane such as hexane, propane or isobutane) in which the polymerization<br>
takes place. This results in a suspension of solid polymer particles in the<br>
medium. Loop reactors are widely used in slurry processes. Detailed<br>
descriptions of slurry polymerization processes are widely reported in the<br>
open and patent literature.<br>
In general, a fluidized bed gas phase polymerization reactor<br>
employs a "bed" of polymer and catalyst which is fluidized by a flow of<br>
monomer which is at least partially gaseous. Heat is generated by the<br>
enthalpy of polymerization of the monomer flowing through the bed.<br>
Unreacted monomer exits the fluidized bed and is contacted with a cooling<br>
system to remove this heat. The cooled monomer is then re-circulated<br>
through the polymerization zone together with "make-up" monomer to<br>
replace that which was polymerized on the previous pass. As will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art, the "fluidized" nature of the<br>
polymerization bed helps to evenly distribute/mix the heat of reaction and<br>
thereby minimize the formation of localized temperature gradients (or "hot<br>
spots"). Nonetheless, it is essential that the heat of reaction be properly<br>
removed so as to avoid softening or melting of the polymer (and the<br>
resultant-and highly undesirable - "reactor chunks"). The obvious way to<br>
maintain good mixing and cooling is to have a very high monomer flow<br>
through the bed. However, extremely high monomer flow causes<br>
undesirable polymer entrainment.<br>
An alternative (and preferable) approach to high monomer flow is<br>
the use of an inert condensable fluid which will boil in the fluidized bed<br>
(when exposed to the enthalpy of polymerization), then exit the fluidized<br>
bed as a gas, then come into contact with a cooling element which<br>
condenses the inert fluid. The condensed, cooled fluid is then returned to<br>
the polymerization zone and the boiling/condensing cycle is repeated.<br>
The above-described use of a condensable fluid additive in a gas<br>
phase polymerization is often referred to by those skilled in the art as<br>
"condensed mode operation" and is described in additional detail in USP<br>
4,543,399 and USP 5,352,749. As noted in the "399 reference, it is<br>
permissible to use alkanes such as butane, pentanes or hexanes as the<br>
condensable fluid and the amount of such condensed fluid preferably does<br>
not exceed about 20 weight per cent of the gas phase.<br>
Other reaction conditions for the polymerization of ethylene which<br>
are reported in the "399 reference are:<br>
Preferred Polymerization Temperatures: about 75°C to about 115°C<br>
(with the lower temperatures being preferred for lower melting<br>
copolymers - especially those having densities of less than 0.915<br>
g/cc - and the higher temperatures being preferred for higher<br>
density copolymers and homopolymers); and<br>
Pressure: up to about 1000 psi (with a preferred range of from<br>
about 100 to 350 psi for olefin polymerization).<br>
The "399 reference teaches that the fluidized bed process is well<br>
adapted for the preparation of polyethylene but further notes that other<br>
monomers may be employed - as is the case in the polymerization<br>
process of this invention.<br>
Further details are provided by the following non-limiting examples.<br>

Anhydrous toluene (~125 ml) was added, and the slurry agitated by<br>
mechanical overhead stirrer (~300 rpm) at room temperature. Stirring of<br>
the slightly beige reaction mixture was maintained overnight.<br>
The slurry was heated at 60°C for an additional 22.5 hours with<br>

was sieved (removing 0.02 g solids) and stored in a glove box for further<br>
use (11.6 g).<br>
Example S10<br>
HO3SF (3.0 g, 30 mmol) was added drop-wise to a slurry of silica (a<br>
commercially available silica, purchased from W. R. Grace under the<br>
tradename "XPO-2408" and previously calcined; 10 g) in anhydrous<br>
heptane (~100 ml) agitated by overhead mechanical stirrer (~250 rpm).<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for several hours,<br>
and stirring decreased to ~150 rpm overnight. The slurry was a very deep<br>
yellow-orange suspension.<br>

pre-treated with TIBAL (25.2 wt % in heptane, 19.68 g, 25 mmol) in<br>
heptane (~100 ml) agitated by mechanical overhead stirrer (~210 rpm) at<br>
room temperature, and the reaction mixture stirred for 15 minutes.<br>
CF3SO3H (0.750 g, 5 mmol) diluted in heptane (~2-3 ml) was added<br>
drop-wise to the reaction mixture, inducing fuming. Stirring was<br>
maintained overnight.<br>
The slurry was observed to have a yellowish coloration<br>
concentrated at the bottom of the reaction vessel. Filtration was<br>
undertaken, the solid rinsed with anhydrous heptane and dried under<br>
vacuum. The white silica was sieved, removing some white solids, and<br>
stored in a glove box for further use (11.4 g).<br>
Example S12<br>
TIBAL (25.2 wt % in heptane, 31.51 g, 40 mmol) was added rapidly<br>
to a slurry of aluminum oxide (activated, basic, Brockmann I, purchased<br>
from Sigma-Aldrich and previously calcined; 10 g) in anhydrous heptane<br>
(~125 ml) agitated by mechanical overhead stirrer (~300 rpm) at room<br>
temperature. Within 5-10 minutes of addition of the TIBAL, there was an<br>
observable thickening of the reaction mixture. Stirring was maintained for<br>
~68 hours.<br>
The TIBAL treated aluminum oxide was collected on a frit and<br>
rinsed thoroughly with heptane. The mostly dry aluminum oxide was<br>
transferred to a 3-necked round bottom flask and re-slurried in heptane.<br>
PhNMe2 (0.606 g, 5 mmol) was added drop-wise to the slurry as a neat<br>
reagent and stirring maintained for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
HO3SF (0.5 g, 5 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture as a neat<br>

of the fluorosulfonic acid induced fuming, and a noticeable beige-brown<br>
coloration of the mixture was observed.<br>
After ~24 hours stirring, the modified aluminum oxide was filtered,<br>
rinsed with heptane and dried in vacuo. The isolated product was sieved<br>

Duplication of S2.<br>
Part B______Preparation of Supported Catalysts<br>
Part B.1 Preparation of Catalyst Component<br>
General procedure: Toluene was deoxygenated and dried (through<br>
columns of alumina, deoxo catalyst and activated molecular sieves under<br>
nitrogen) prior to use. Unless otherwise specified, the toluene and other<br>
solvents (e.g. heptane) are dried and deoxygenated this way. The support<br>
material, namely silica "XPO-2408" for comparative examples or modified<br>
support for the inventive examples was weighted into a 100 ml flask and<br>
toluene was added to make a slurry. A solution of methyaluminoxane (a<br>
commercially available material, sold under the tradename "PMAO-IP" by<br>
Akzo Nobel) of 12% weight aluminum was added to the slurry while the<br>
slurry was stirred with a mechanical stirrer or with a minimum stirring<br>
speed with a magnetic stirrer.<br>
Part B.2 Preparation of Supported Catalyst Systems<br>
The catalyst component slurry from Part 1 was stirred for 16 hours,<br>
which was filtered to remove the supernatant, and the solid was re-slurried<br>
into toluene.<br>
A solution of a catalyst complex (sufficient to provide an AI:Ti or<br>
AI:Zr molar ratio of approximately 120:1) was added slowly to the slurry.<br>
The combined mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature and an<br>
additional 2 hours at 45°C. The catalyst system solids were recovered by<br>
filtration and washed with small amounts of toluene for 3 times. The<br>
catalyst was dried under vacuum and sieved.<br>
Part C______Polymerization of Ethvlene<br>
General Procedures: All polymerization work was conducted by<br>
using a 2 litre, stirred, autoclave reactor running in a gas phase mode of<br>
operation. Polymerizations were conducted at 80 to 90°C under a total<br>
reaction pressure of 200 psig. A seed bed of dry NaCI (160 g) was used.<br>
A specified amount of 25% solution of tri-isobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) was<br>
used as a poison scavenger. Some copolymerizations were studied by<br>
injecting hexene (5 ml or 10 ml) and/or hydrogen into the reactor.<br>
After the addition of scavenger (and comonomer), ethylene was<br>
used to push the catalyst system into the reactor and to bring the reactor<br>
pressure to the total pressure of 200 psig. General polymerization<br>
conditions are summarized in Table 1.<br>
The results of polymerization runs (Examples 1 to 36) are collected<br>
in Table 2.<br>
Example 1 - Comparative<br>
The catalyst was made by supporting PMAO-IP (Akzo-Nobel) and<br>
(tBu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2 on calcined silica (XPO-2408, calcined at 200°C for 2<br>
hours under air and 600°C for 6 hours under N2) with a titanium loading of<br>
0.037 mmol/g. The ratio of AI:Ti was 120:1. 35 mg of such catalyst<br>
produced 26 g of polyethylene. The activity of the catalyst was 39,812<br>
gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Example 2<br>
The catalyst was made by supporting PMAO-IP and<br>
(tBu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2 on support S1. The titanium loading was 0.037 mmol/g<br>
and the ratio of AI:Ti was 120:1. 13 mg of such catalyst produced 10 g of<br>
polyethylene. The activity of the catalyst was 41,225 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Example 3<br>
The catalyst was made by supporting PMAO-IP and<br>
(tBu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2 on support S2. The loading of titanium was 0.037<br>
mmol/g. 30 mg of such a catalyst resulted in run-away reaction. The<br>
polymerization had to be quenched.<br>
Examples 4 and 5<br>
The same catalyst as in Example 3 was used. But the amount was<br>
reduced to 11 mg. In both cases, the temperature excursion was too high.<br>
No meaningful activity was obtained.<br>
Example 6<br>
The catalyst was made in the same way as in Example 2, but the<br>
loading of the titanium was reduced to 0.019 mmol/g. 10 mg of this<br>
catalyst was used and the run was very smooth. 32 g of polyethylene was<br>
obtained. The activity was 333,970 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Example 7<br>
6 mg of the catalyst in Example 6 was used. Copolymerization with<br>
5 ml of 1-hexene produced 32 g of polymers. The activity was 604,569<br>
gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Examples 8 and 9<br>
Similar to Example 7, but 5 psi of hydrogen was added to the<br>
reactor. Activities of 80,766 and 118,764 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr were<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 10<br>
The support was made to duplicate S2. This support (S3) was used<br>
to make a catalyst similar to the one in Example 6. 11 mg of the catalyst<br>
was used and 33 g of polyethylene was produced. The activity was<br>
313,096 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Examples 11 and 12<br>
The support was re-made again. This support (S4) was used to<br>
make a catalyst similar to the one in Example 6 and in Example 10. The<br>
polymerization was carried out in another reactor. The activities obtained<br>
were 286,000 and 211,442 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Examples 13 and 14<br>
Support S5 was made reacting the calcined silica with butyl ethyl<br>
magnesium (BEM). The loading of Ti was 0.037mmol/g. The activities<br>
obtained were 120,611 and 96,347 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Examples 15 and 16<br>
Support S6 was used to make the supported catalyst. The activities<br>
were 118,366 and 111,256 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Examples 17 to 21<br>
The support (S7) was made by using substantially the same<br>
procedures which were used to prepare support S2 except that the<br>
PhNMe2 was omitted. The catalyst made by using S7 was still very active<br>
but not as active as the ones made by using S2, S3 or S4. See Table 2.<br>
Examples 22 and 23 - Comparative<br>
Silica supported PMAO-IP was modified by reacting with<br>
[PhNHMe2][FSO3]. That is, no further aluminoxane was added after the<br>
[PhNHMe2][FSO3]. This support was used to support the titanium catalyst.<br>
The activities for the two runs were only 6,431 and 10,886<br>
gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Example 24<br>
Support S9 which was made by reacting TIBAL treated silica with<br>
[PhNHMe2][FSO3]. The catalyst made with this support had an activity of<br>
63,824 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Example 25<br>
32 mg of the catalyst made by using support S10 was used. The<br>
polymerization temperature increased very rapidly so the experiment was<br>
repeated (Example 26) with a lower concentration of titanium catalyst.<br>
Example 26<br>
The amount of catalyst was reduced from 32 mg to 10 mg. A<br>
smooth run was obtained. The catalyst activity was calculated to be<br>
107,186 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Examples 27 and 28<br>
S11 was used to make the supported catalyst. Catalyst activities<br>
for these two randomized runs were found to be 66,794 and 72,012<br>
gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr.<br>
Example 29<br>
The catalyst made by using S12 had an activity of 53,530<br>
gPE/mmolTi[C2]hr only.<br>
Example 30 - Comparative<br>
(n-BuCp)2ZrCI2 was supported on calcined XPO-2408. The catalyst<br>
activity was found to be 28,422 gPE/mmolZr[C2]hr.<br>
Example 31<br>
(n-BuCp)2ZrCI2 was supported on S4 with Zr loading of 0.05<br>
mmol/g. 42 mg of the catalyst produced 89.8 g of polyethylene. The<br>
catalyst activity was 84,795 gPE/mmolZr[C2]hr.<br>
Example 32<br>
Repeat of Example 31.<br>
Example 33 and 34<br>
The catalyst (lnd)(t-Bu3P=N)TiMe2 (loading: 0.037 mmol/g support)<br>
was mixed in toluene with B(C6F5)3 with a ratio of 1:3. The solution was<br>
then added to a slurry of the support S3 in toluene. The slurry was stirred<br>
for 1 hour and was pumped to dryness. The solid catalyst was sieved<br>
prior to use. The activity is reported in Table 2.<br>
Example 35<br>
The support S3 was mixed with B(C6F5)3 (0.111 mmol/g support)<br>
and was stirred mechanically overnight. The catalyst (lnd)(t-<br>
Bu3P=N)TiMe2 (loading: 0.37 mmol/g support) was then added. The<br>
mixture was stirred for 1 hour and was pumped to dryness. The activity for<br>
ethylene polymerization is shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 36 - Comparative<br>
The catalyst (lnd)(t-Bu3P=N)TiMe2 was mixed with B(C6F5)3 in<br>
toluene with a ratio of 1:3. The solution was added to calcined XPO-2408<br>
silica treated with TIBAL. The mixture was pumped to dryness. The<br>
polymerization result is shown in Table 2.<br>

11. The supported catalyst of claim 10 wherein said transition metal catalyst is an<br>
organometallic complex of a group 4 metal<br>
12. The supported catalyst of claim 11 wherein said organometallic complex of a<br>
group 4 metal is defined by the formula:<br>
wherein M is selected from the titanium, hafnium and zirconium; L1 and L2<br>
are independently selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadienyl,<br>
substituted cyclopentadienyl (including indenyl and fluorenyl) and<br>
heteroatom ligands, with the proviso that L1 and L2 may be bridged together<br>
so as to form a bidentate ligand; L1 (each occurrence) is an activatable ligand<br>
and n is 1 or 2.<br>
13. A process for the preparation of linear low density polyethylene which<br>
comprises contacting ethyiene and at least one C3-8 alpha olefin under<br>
polymerization conditions in the presence of the supported catalyst of claim<br>
10.<br>
A supported catalyst for olefin polymerization comprises a<br>
combination of a novel metal oxide support and an activator which is an<br>
aluminoxane or a boron activator. The novel metal oxide support of this<br>
invention is a conventional particulate metal oxide support material (such<br>
as silica or alumina) which has been treated with a halosulfonic acid. A<br>
catalyst system which contains this novel catalyst support and a transition<br>
metal catalyst is highly active for olefin polymerization (in comparison to<br>
prior art catalyst systems which use a conventional metal oxide support).</td>
