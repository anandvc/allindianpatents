BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system, and in particular, to a system and method for<br>
performing a fast handover of a mobile subscriber station, initiated by a handover<br>
request of a serving base station.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Research into a 4th generation (4G) communication system, which is the<br>
next generation communication system, is currently being conducted to provide<br>
users with services having various Qualities-of-Service (QoSs) at a transfer rate<br>
of about 100 Mbps. More particularly, active research into the 4G communication<br>
system is being carried out to support high-speed services for guaranteeing<br>
mobility and QoS in a broadband wireless access (BWA) communication system,<br>
such as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and a wireless<br>
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system. Conventional communication<br>
systems include an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)<br>
802.16a communication system and an IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a and IEEE 802.16e communication systems use an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and/or an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme in order to<br>
support a broadband transmission network for a physical channel of the wireless<br>
MAN system. The IEEE 802.16a communication system considers only a state in<br>
which a subscriber station (SS) is located in a fixed position, i.e., mobility of an<br>
SS is never taken into consideration, and a unicell structure. However, the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system considers mobility of an SS in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system, and accordingly, in the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system, the SS is called a mobile subscriber station (MSS).<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram schematically illustrating a a conventional<br><br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system. Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system has a multicell structure, i.e., a cell 100 and a cell 150,<br>
and includes a base station (BS) 110 managing the cell 100, a BS 140 managing<br>
the cell 150, and a plurality of MSSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153. Signal<br>
exchange between the base stations 110 and 140 and the MSSs 111, 113, 130, 151,<br>
and 153 is achieved using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br>
The MSS 130 is located in a boundary region of the cell 100 and the cell<br>
150, i.e., a handover region. If the MSS 130, while exchanging signals with the<br>
BS 110, moves in the direction of the cell 150 managed by the BS 140, its serving<br>
BS changes from the BS 110 to the BS 140.<br>
FIG. 2 is a signaling diagram illustrating a handover process initiated at<br>
the request of an MSS in a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a serving BS 210 transmits a Mobile Neighbor Advertisement<br>
(MOB_NBR_ADV) message to an MSS 200 in Step 211. A format of the<br>
MOBNBRADV message is shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the MOB NBR ADV message includes a plurality<br>
of information elements (IEs), i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type<br>
of a transmission message, an Operator ID indicating a network identifier (ID), an<br>
N_NEIGHBORS indicating the number of neighbor BSs, a Neighbor BS-ID<br>
indicating IDs of the neighbor BSs, a Physical Frequency indicating a physical<br>
channel frequency of the neighbor BS, a Configuration Change Count indicating<br>
the number of changes in configuration, a Hysteresis threshold indicating<br>
hysteresis information, a MAHO (Mobile Assisted Handover) report period<br>
indicating a period for which an average carrier-to-interference and noise ratio<br>
(CINR) value of a neighbor BS is reported, and a TLV (Type/Length/Value)<br>
Encoded Neighbor Information indicating other information related to the<br>
neighbor BS.<br>
The MSS 200 can acquire information on neighbor BSs by receiving the<br>
MOBNBRADV message. If the MSS 200 desires to scan CINRs of pilot<br>
channel signals transmitted from neighbor BSs and the serving BS 210, it<br>
transmits a Mobile Scanning Interval Allocation Request (MOB SCNREQ)<br>
message to the serving BS 210 in Step 213. A format of the MOB_SCN_REQ<br>
message is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the MOB_SCN_REQ message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a transmission<br>
message, and a Scan Duration indicating a scanning duration for which the MSS<br>
200 desires to scan CINRs of pilot channel signals received from the neighbor<br>
BSs. Because a time at which the MSS 200 makes a scan request is not directly<br>
related to a CINR scanning operation for the pilot channel signals, a detailed<br>
description thereof will not be given herein.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBSCNREQ message, the serving BS 210<br>
includes information based on which the MSS 200 will perform scanning in a<br>
Mobile Scanning Interval Allocation Response (MOBSCNRSP) message with<br>
Scan Duration^, and transmits the MOB_SCN_RSP message to the MSS 200 in<br>
Step\215. A format of the MOBSCNRSP message is shown in Table 3.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, the MOBSCNRSP message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a transmission<br>
message, a Connection ID (CID) indicating a CID of the MSS 200 that<br>
transmitted the MOB_SCN_REQ message, a Scan Duration, and a Start Frame .<br>
indicating a time at which a scanning operation starts. The Scan Duration<br>
indicates a scanning duration for which the MSS 200 performs the pilot CINR<br>
scanning, and if the Scan Duration is set to '0' (Scan Duration=0), it indicates that<br>
the scan request of the MSS 200 is rejected by an SS.<br><br>
Upon receiving the MOB_SCN_RSP message including the scanning<br>
information, the MSS 200 performs CINR scanning on the pilot channel signals<br>
received from the serving BS 210 and neighbor BSs acquired through reception<br>
of the MOB NBRADV message according to parameters, i.e., Scan Duration,<br>
included in the MOBSCNRSP message in Step 217.<br>
After completing CINR scanning on the pilot channel signals received<br>
from the neighbor BSs and the serving BS 210, the MSS 200 determines if it<br>
should change its current serving BS to a new serving BS, which is different from<br>
the serving BS 210, in Step 219.<br>
When the MSS 200 determines to changes its current serving BS, it<br>
transmits a Mobile Subscriber Station Handover Request (MOBMSSHOREQ)<br>
message to the serving BS 210 in Step 221. Herein, a new BS other than the<br>
serving BS to which the MSS 200 currently belongs, i.e., a possible new serving<br>
BS to which the MSS 200 will be handed over, will be referred to as a "target<br>
BS."<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 4, the MOBMSSHO REQ message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a<br>
transmission message and the scanning results acquired by the MSS 200. In Table<br>
4, an N_Recommended indicates the number of neighbor BSs that transmitted<br>
pilot channel signals of which CINRs are higher than or equal to a predetermined<br>
CINR, as a result of CINR scanning on the pilot channel signals from the<br>
neighbor BSs by the MSS 200. That is, the NRecommended indicates the<br>
number of recommended neighbor BSs to which the MSS 200 can be handed over.<br>
The MOBMSSHOREQ message also includes a Neighbor BS-ID<br>
indicating IDs of neighbor BSs indicated by the NRecommended, a BS CINR<br>
mean, which indicates an average CINR for pilot channel signals from the<br>
neighbor BSs, a Service level prediction indicating a service level predicted to be<br>
provided to the MSS 200 by the neighbor BSs, and an Estimated HO start<br>
indicating a time at which the MSS 200 will start handover.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBMSSHOREQ message transmitted by the<br>
MSS 200, the serving BS 210 detects a list of candidate target BSs to which the<br>
MSS 200 can be handed over, from N_Recommended information in the received<br>
MOBMSSHOREQ message in Step 223. Herein, the list of candidate target<br>
BSs to which the MSS 200 can be handed over will be referred to as a "candidate<br>
target BS list," and it will be assumed in FIG. 2 that the candidate target BS list<br>
has a first target BS 220 and a second target BS 230. The candidate target BS list<br>
can also include a plurality of target BSs, in addition to the two target BSs.<br>
The serving BS 210 transmits HO_PRE NOTIFICATION messages to<br>
the target BSs included in the candidate target BS list, i.e., the first target BS 220<br>
and the second target BS 230 in Steps 225 and 227. A format of the<br>
HOPRENOTIFICATION message is shown in Table 5.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 5, the HOPRE NOTIFICATION message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, i.e., a Global Header which is commonly included in messages<br>
exchanged between BSs in a backbone network, an MSS ID of the MSS 200 that<br>
desires to be handed over to the first target BS 220 or the second target BS 230,<br>
an Estimated Time to HO indicating an estimated time at which the MSS 200 will<br>
start handover, a Required BW indicating information on a bandwidth for which<br><br>
the MSS 200 requests a target BS which will become a new serving BS, an SFID<br>
indicating an ID of a service flow that the MSS 200 is receiving, and a Required<br>
QoS indicating information on a service level for each SFID. The bandwidth<br>
(BW) and the service level (QoS) requested by the MSS 200 are equal to the<br>
predicted service level information recorded in the MOB_MSSHO_REQ message<br>
described in Table 4.<br>
A format of the general Global Header commonly included in messages<br>
exchanged between BSs in a backbone network, like the<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION message, is shown in Table 6.<br><br>
As shown in Table 6, the Global Header includes a plurality of IEs, i.e., a<br>
Message Type indicating a type of a transmission message, a Sender BS-ID<br>
indicating a transmission BS that transmits the transmission message, a Target<br>
BS-ID indicating a reception BS that receives the transmission message, and a<br>
Num Records indicating the number of MSSs corresponding to records included<br>
in the transmission message.<br>
Upon receiving the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION messages from the<br>
serving BS 210, the first target BS 220 and the second target BS 230 transmit<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE messages to the serving BS 210 in<br>
response to the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION messages in Steps 229 and 231. A<br><br>
format of the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message is shown in<br>
Table 7.<br><br>
As shown in Table 7, the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE<br>
message includes a plurality of IEs, i.e., a Global Header which is commonly<br>
included in messages exchanged between BSs in a backbone network, an MSS<br>
unique ID of the MSS 200 that desires to be handed over to the target BSs, and<br>
bandwidth and service level information for indicating a bandwidth and a service<br>
level supportable by the target BSs to which the MSS 200 is handed over.<br>
Upon receiving the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE messages<br>
from the first target BS 220 and the second target BS 230, the serving BS 210<br>
analyzes the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE messages received from<br>
the first target BS 220 and the second target BS 230, and selects a target BS that<br><br>
can optimally support the bandwidth and service level requested by the MSS 200<br>
after handover, as a final target BS to which the MSS 200 will be handed over.<br>
For example, if it is assumed that a service level supportable by the first target BS<br>
220 is lower than the service level requested by the MSS 200 and a service level<br>
supportable by the second target BS 230 is higher than or equal to the service<br>
level requested by the MSS 200, the serving BS 210 selects the second target BS<br>
230 as a final target BS to which the MSS 200 will be handed over. Therefore, the<br>
serving BS 210 transmits a HOCONFIRM message to the second target BS 230<br>
in response to the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message in Step 233.<br>
A format of the HO_CONFIRM message is shown in Table 8.<br><br>
As shown in Table 8, the HO_CONFIRM message includes a plurality of<br>
IEs, i.e., a Global Header which is commonly included in messages exchanged<br>
between BSs in a backbone network as described with reference to Table 6, an<br><br>
MSS ID of the MSS 200 that desires to be handed over to the selected target BS,<br>
and bandwidth and service level information for indicating a bandwidth and a<br>
service level supportable by the selected target BS to which the MSS 200 is<br>
handed over.<br>
In addition, the serving BS 210 transmits a Mobile BS Handover<br>
Response (MOB_BSHO_RSP) message to the MSS 200 in response to the<br>
MOB_MSSHO_REQ message in Step 235. Herein, the MOB_BSHO_RSP<br>
message includes information on a target BS to which the MSS 200 will be<br>
handed over. A format of the MOBBSHORSP message is shown in Table 9.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 9, the MOBBSHO RSP message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a transmission<br>
message, an Estimated HO time indicating an estimated time at which a handover<br>
process will start, and information on target BSs selected by the serving BS. In<br>
addition, an N_Recommended in the MOBBSHORSP message indicates the<br>
number of target BSs satisfying the bandwidth and service level requested by the<br>
MSS 200, among the target BSs in the candidate target BS list. The<br>
MOBBSHORSP message includes IDs for target BSs indicated by the<br>
NRecommended, and a predicted service level supportable to the MSS 200 by<br>
the target BSs.<br>
Although only the information on one target BS of the second target BS<br>
230 among the target BSs existing in the candidate target BS list is finally<br>
included in the MOBBSHO RSP message in FIG. 2, if there are several target<br>
BSs satisfying the bandwidth and service level requested by the MSS 200 among<br>
the target BSs existing in the candidate target BS list, information on the several<br>
target BSs is included in the MOBBSHORSP message.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBBSHORSP message, the MSS 200 analyzes<br>
NRecommended information included in the received MOBBSHORSP<br>
message, and selects a target BS to which it will be handed over based on the<br>
analysis result.<br>
After selecting the target BS, the MSS 200 transmits a Mobile Handover<br>
Indication (MOBHOIND) message to the serving BS 210 in response to the<br>
MOB_BSHO_RSP message in Step 237. A format of the MOB_HO_IND<br>
message is shown in Table 10.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 10, the MOBHOIND message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a transmission<br>
message, a HOINDtype indicating whether the MSS 200 has determined,<br>
canceled, or rejected handover to the selected final target BS, a TargetBSID<br>
indicating an ID of the selected final target BS when the MSS 200 determines the<br>
handover, and a HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) Tuple used for<br>
authentication of the MOB_HO_IND message. The MSS 200 transmits a<br>
MOB_HO_RSP message with HO _IND_type=00 when it has determined to<br>
perform handover to the final target BS, transmits a MOBHO RSP message<br>
with HO_IND_type=01 when it has determined to cancel the handover to the<br>
final target BS, and transmits a MOBHORSP message with HO_IND_type=10<br>
when it has determined to reject the handover to the final target BS. Upon<br>
receiving the MOBHOIND message with HO_IND_type=10, the serving BS<br>
210 updates the candidate target BS list and retransmits a MOBBSHOJR.SP<br>
message with the candidate target BS list to the MSS 200.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBHOIND message with HO_IND_type=00, the<br>
serving BS 210 recognizes that the MSS 200 will perform handover to the target<br>
BS included in the MOB_HO_IND message, i.e., the second target BS 230, and<br>
releases a connection currently set up to the MSS 200 or retains the connection<br>
set up to the MSS 200 for a predetermined time until it receives a report<br>
indicating completion of the handover process from the target BS finally selected<br>
by the MSS 200, i.e., the second target BS 230, in Step 239.<br><br>
After transmitting the MOBHOIND message to the serving BS 210,<br>
the MSS 200 performs the remaining handover operation with the second target<br>
BS 230.<br>
FIG. 3 is a signaling diagram illustrating a handover process initiated at<br>
the request of a BS in a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
However, before a description of FIG. 3 is given, it should be noted that the<br>
handover initiated at the request of a BS occurs when the BS requires load<br>
sharing for dispersing its own load to neighbor BSs due to its excessive load, or<br>
when it is necessary to cope with a variation in an uplink state of an MSS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a serving BS 310 transmits a MOBNBRADV<br>
message to an MSS 300 in Step 311. The MSS 300 can acquire information on<br>
neighbor BSs by receiving the MOBNBRADV message.<br>
If the serving BS 310 detects a need for handover of the MSS 300 that it<br>
is currently managing in Step 313, it transmits HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION<br>
messages to neighbor BSs in Steps 315 and 317. Herein, the<br>
HOPRENOTIFICATION message includes information on a bandwidth and<br>
service level that should be supported by a target BS, which will become a new<br>
serving BS of the MSS 300. Additionally, it is assumed in FIG. 3 that the neighbor<br>
BSs of the serving BS 310 include two BSs, i.e., a first target BS 320 and a<br>
second target BS 330.<br>
Upon receiving the HOPRENOTIFICATION messages, the first target<br>
BS 320 and the second target BS 330 transmit<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE messages to the serving BS 310 in<br>
response to the HOPRENOTIFICATION messages, respectively, in Steps 319<br>
and 321. The HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message includes<br>
ACK/NACK indicating if the target BSs can perform handover requested by the<br>
, serving BS 310, and information on a bandwidth and service level supportable to<br>
the MSS 300.<br>
Upon receiving the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE messages<br>
from the first target BS 320 and the second target BS 330, the serving BS 310<br><br>
selects target BSs that can support the bandwidth and service level requested by<br>
the MSS 300. For example, if it is assumed that a service level supportable by the<br>
first target BS 320 is lower than the service level requested by the MSS 300 and a<br>
service level supportable by the second target BS 330 is higher than or equal to<br>
the service level requested by the MSS 300, the serving BS 310 selects the second<br>
target BS 330 as a target BS to which the MSS 300 can be handed over.<br>
After selecting the second target BS 330 as a candidate target BS, the<br>
serving BS 310 transmits a Mobile BS Handover Request (MOBBSHOREQ)<br>
message including the updated candidate target BS list to the MSS 300 in Step<br>
323. Herein, the candidate target BS list can include a plurality of target BSs. A<br>
format of the MOBBSHOREQ message is shown in Table 11.<br><br>
As shown in Table 11, the MOBBSHOREQ message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a<br>
transmission message and information on the target BSs selected by the serving<br>
BS 310. In Table 11, an NRecommended indicates the number of neighbor BSs<br>
selected as candidate target BSs by the serving BS 310, and the<br>
MOBBSHOREQ message includes a Neighbor BS-ID indicating IDs for the<br>
neighbor BSs indicated by the NRecommended, and information on a bandwidth<br><br>
and service level supportable to the MSS 300 by the neighbor BSs.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBBSHOREQ message, the MSS 300<br>
recognizes that handover has been requested by the serving BS 310, and selects a<br>
final target BS to which it will perform handover, based on the NRecommended<br>
information included in the MOBBSHOREQ message. Before selecting the<br>
final target BS, if the MSS 300 desires to scan CINRs of the pilot channel signals<br>
transmitted from the serving BS 310 and the neighbor BSs, the MSS 300<br>
transmits a MOBSCNREQ message to the serving BS 310 in Step 325.<br>
Because a time at which the MSS 300 makes a scan request is not directly related<br>
to a CINR scanning operation for the pilot channel signals, a detailed description<br>
thereof will not be given herein.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBSCNREQ message, the serving BS 310<br>
transmits a MOBSCNRSP message including scanning information based on<br>
which the MSS 300 will perform scanning, to the MSS 300 in Step 327. Upon<br>
receiving the MOB_SCN_RSP message including the scanning information, the<br>
MSS 300 performs CINR scanning on the pilot channel signals received from<br>
neighbor BSs acquired through reception of the MOBNBRADV message,<br>
candidate target BSs acquired through reception of the MOBBSHOREQ<br>
message, and the serving BS 310, according to parameters, i.e., Scan Duration,<br>
included in the MOB SCNRSP message, in Step 329.<br>
After selecting its final candidate target BS, the MSS 300 transmits a<br>
Mobile MSS Handover Response (MOB_MSSHO_RSP) to the serving BS 310 in<br>
response to the MOB BSHOREQ message in Step 331. A format of the<br>
MOB_MSSHO_RSP message is shown in Table 12.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 12, the MOBMSSHORSP includes a plurality of<br>
IEs, i.e., a Management Message Type indicating a type of a transmission<br>
message, an Estimated HO time indicating an estimated time at which the<br>
handover process will start, and information on the target BSs selected by the<br>
MSS 310. In Table 12, an NRecommended indicates the number of neighbor<br>
BSs selected as candidate target BSs by the MSS 300, and the<br>
MOBMSSHORSP message includes a Neighbor BS-ID indicating IDs for the<br>
neighbor BSs indicated by the NRecommended, and information on a service<br>
level supportable to the MSS 300 by the neighbor BSs.<br>
The serving BS 310 transmits a HOCONFIRM message to the neighbor<br>
BS selected as the final target BS by the MSS 300 in response to the<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message in Step 333. After selecting<br>
the final target BS, the MSS 300 transmits a MOB_HO_IND message with<br>
HO_IND_type=00 to the serving BS 310 in Step 335.<br>
Upon receiving the MOB_HO_IND message with HO_IND_type=00, the<br>
serving BS 310 re-recognizes that the MSS 300 will perform handover to the final<br>
target BS included in the MOB_HO_IND message, and then releases a<br>
connection currently set up to the MSS 300 or retains the connection set up to the<br>
MSS 300 for a predetermined time, until it receives a report indicating completion<br>
of the handover process from the finally selected target BS, i.e., the second target<br><br>
BS 330, in Step 337.<br>
After transmitting the MOB_HO_IND message to the serving BS 310,<br>
the MSS 300 performs the remaining handover operation with the second target<br>
BS330.<br>
FIG. 4 is a signaling diagram illustrating a network re-entry process<br>
performed after a handover of an MSS in a conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system. Referring to FIG. 4, as an MSS 400 changes its<br>
connection to a final target BS 450, acquires downlink synchronization with the<br>
final target BS 450, and receives a downlinkJVlAP (DL_MAP) message from the<br>
final target BS 450 in Step 411. Herein, the DLMAP message includes<br>
parameters related to a downlink of the final target BS 450.<br>
Further, the MSS 400 receives an uplinkJVlAP (ULMAP) message from<br>
the final target BS 450 in Step 413. The ULMAP message includes parameters<br>
related to an uplink of the final target BS 450, and includes a Fast UL Ranging IE<br>
allocated to support fast UL ranging of the MSS 400 whose handover is being<br>
performed by the final target BS 450. The final target BS 450 allocates the Fast<br>
UL Ranging IE to the MSS 400 to minimize a possible delay caused by handover.<br>
Therefore, the MSS 400 can perform initial ranging with the final target BS 450<br>
on a contention-free basis according to the Fast UL Ranging IE. A format of the<br>
Fast UL Ranging IE included in the UL_MAP message is shown in Table 13.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 13, Fast_UL_ranging_IE() includes a Medium Access Control<br>
(MAC) address of an MSS that will be provided with ranging opportunity, an<br>
Uplink Interval Usage Code (UIUC) providing information on a field in which a<br>
start offset value for the Fast_UL_ranging_IE() is recorded, an offset of and the<br>
number of symbols in a contention-free-based ranging opportunity interval<br>
allocated to the MSS 400, and the number of subchannels. A MAC address of the<br>
MSS 400 has been reported to the final target BS 450 through messages<br>
exchanged between a serving BS and a target BS in a backbone network in the<br>
handover process described with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3, e.g., the<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION/HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE/HO_CON<br>
FIRM messages.<br>
Upon receiving the UL_MAP message, the MSS 400 transmits a Ranging<br>
Request (RNG_REQ) message to the final target BS 450 according to the Fast UL<br>
Ranging IE in Step 415. Upon receiving the RNG_REQ message, the final target<br>
BS 450 transmits a Ranging Response (RNGRSP) message including<br>
information used for correcting frequency, time and transmission power for the<br>
ranging, to the MSS 400 in Step 417.<br><br>
After completing the initial ranging, the MSS 400 and the final target BS<br>
450 perform a re-authorization operation on the MSS 400 (MSS RE-<br>
AUTHORIZATION) in Step 419. In the re-authorization operation, if there is no<br>
change in security context exchanged between an old (or former) serving BS of<br>
the MSS 400 and the final target BS 450, the final target BS 450 uses the security<br>
context intact. A format of an MSS Information Response (MSS_INFO_RSP)<br>
message, which is a backbone network message for providing security context<br>
information of the MSS 400, is shown in Table 14.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 14, the MSSINFORSP message includes ID information of an<br>
MSS registered in a serving BS, security context information such as Security<br>
Association Information for each MSS, network service information for each<br>
MSS, and capability information of each MSS.<br>
When the re-authentication operation for the final target BS 450 and the<br>
MSS 400 is completed, the MSS 400 transmits a Registration Request<br>
(REG_REQ) message to the final target BS 450 in Step 421. The REGREQ<br>
message includes registration information of the MSS 400. The final target BS<br>
450 transmits a Registration Response (REGRSP) message to the MSS 400 in<br>
response to the REG_REQ message in Step 423. Herein, the final target BS 450<br>
can recognize the MSS 400 as an MSS that has been handed over thereto, by<br>
detecting registration information of the MSS 400 included in the REG_REQ<br>
message received from the MSS 400. Accordingly, the final target BS 450 maps<br>
connection information in the old serving BS of the MSS 400 to connection<br>
information in the final target BS 450, and transmits to the MSS 400 the<br>
REG_RSP message including TLV values based on which a service flow that can<br>
be actually provided in the final target BS can be reset. A format of the TLV .<br>
including mapping information for connection setup in the serving BS and the<br>
final target BS 450 is shown in Table 15.<br>
Table 15<br><br><br>
In Table 15, TLV included in the REG_RSP message transmitted to the<br>
MSS 400 provides CID information used in the old serving BS, before handover<br>
of the MSS 400, and CID information to be used in the final target BS 450, after<br>
handover of the MSS 400. In addition, when the final target BS 450 provides a<br>
service that is different from the service flow provided by the old serving BS<br>
before handover, the TLV includes information on the changed service parameters.<br>
After completing the network re-entry process with the final target BS<br>
450, the MSS 400 performs a normal communication service through the final<br>
target BS 450 in Step 425.<br>
As described above, in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, in a<br>
handover process initiated at the request of an MSS, the MSS determines a need<br>
for handover by measuring a change in downlink channel through a scanning<br>
process and transmits a handover request message to a serving BS. In response,<br>
the serving BS receives service level prediction information for neighbor BSs<br>
recommended by the MSS and delivers the service level prediction information<br>
back to the MSS. Then the MSS can select a final target BS based on CINRs of<br><br>
downlink channels from the neighbor BSs and service level information of the<br>
neighbor BSs. The CINR measurement is performed before the MSS determines<br>
handover, and a message exchange for predicting a service level supportable in a<br>
backbone network is performed after the MSS determines to handover.<br>
However, in a handover process initiated at the request of a BS, a serving<br>
BS, after determining a need for handover, should exchange messages for service<br>
level prediction with all neighbor BSs. An MSS receiving a MOBBSHOREQ<br>
message including a recommended-BS list should perform a scanning operation<br>
to-select-a final target BS among the recommended BSs. Therefore, compared<br>
with the handover process initiated at the request of an MSS, the handover<br>
process initiated at the request of a BS performs both the service level<br>
measurement and the scanning operation after the handover is determined.<br>
It can be expected that the number of BSs recommended by an MSS<br>
through CINR values in the handover process initiated at the request of an MSS is<br>
less than the number of BSs recommended through service level prediction in the<br>
handover process initiated at the request of a BS because a time for which the<br>
MSS performs CINR scanning on each of neighbor BSs is short. Accordingly,<br>
compared with the handover process initiated at the request of an MSS, the<br>
handover process initiated at the request of a BS requires a longer processing time.<br>
Further, a BS sends a handover request to an MSS for several reasons,<br>
especially when the BS determines that handover of the MSS is urgent. Therefore,<br>
there is a demand for a method capable of performing a handover over a shorter<br>
time by improving the handover process initiated at the request of a BS, which<br>
requires a longer processing time compared with the handover process initiated at<br>
the request of an MSS.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail herein below with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention proposes a scheme for a fast handover of a mobile<br>
subscriber station (MSS) initiated at a handover request of a base station (BS) in<br>
an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e<br>
communication system, "which is a broadband wireless access (BWA)<br>
communication system. Herein, the IEEE 802.16e communication system is a<br>
BWA communication system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and/or an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme. The IEEE 802.16e communication system,<br>
as it uses the OFDM/OFDMA scheme, can support high-speed data transmission<br>
by transmitting physical channel signals using a plurality of subcarriers. Further,<br><br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system supports a multicell structure to support<br>
mobility of MSSs.<br>
FIG. 5 is a signaling diagram illustrating a signaling procedure between<br>
an MSS and BSs for supporting fast handover of the MSS initiated by a BS in an<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 5, if a serving BS 540 detects a need for a handover<br>
of an MSS 500 that it is managing in Step 511, the serving BS 540 starts a<br>
handover process initiated at the request of a BS. Accordingly, the serving BS 540<br>
transmits HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION messages to neighbor BSs to which the<br>
MSS 500 will possibly be handed over in Steps 513, 515, and 517. It is assumed<br>
in FIG. 5 that the neighbor BSs of the serving BS 540 includes three BSs, i.e., a<br>
first target BS 560, a second target BS 580, and a third target BS 590.<br>
Upon receiving the HOPRENOTIFICATION message, each of the<br>
target BSs transmit a HOPRENOTIFICATIONRESPONSE message to the<br>
serving BS 540 in Steps 519, 521, and 523. Thereafter, the serving BS 540 selects<br>
a target BS or target BSs that can support a bandwidth and a service level<br>
requested by the MSS 500. For example, if it is assumed that a service level<br>
supportable by the first target BS 560 and the second target BS 580 is higher than<br>
or equal to the service level requested by the MSS 500 and a service level<br>
supportable by the third target BS 590 is lower than the service level requested by<br>
the MSS 500, the serving BS 540 selects the first target BS 560 and the second<br>
target BS 580 as candidate target BSs.<br>
The serving BS 540 creates a recommended list using the candidate target<br>
BSs, and transmits a MOBBSHOREQ message including the recommended list<br>
to the MSS 500 in Step 527. A format of the MOB BSHOREQ message used in<br>
this embodiment is shown in Table 16.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 16, compared with the conventional<br>
MOB_BSHO_REQ message of Table 11, the redefined MOB_BSHO_REQ<br>
message further includes a 1-bit HOoption field and a 7-bit reserved field,. If a<br>
HOoption value of the redefined MOBBSHOREQ message is set to '0'<br>
(HO_option=0), the MSS 500 operates as when the conventional<br>
MOBBSHOREQ message is received, i.e., the procedure illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
However, if the HOoption value is set to '1' (HO_option=l), the MSS 500<br>
performs a fast (network assisted) handover process as proposed in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The serving BS 540 transmits HOCONFIRM messages of Table 8 to the<br>
target BSs included in the recommended list, i.e., the first and second target BSs<br>
560 and 580, in Steps 525 and 529. Upon receiving the HO_CONFIRM messages,<br>
the first and second target BSs 560 and 580 each reserve a Fast UL Ranging IE<br>
for the MSS 500, and transmits a ULJMAP message including the Fast UL<br>
Ranging IE to the MSS 500 in Steps 535 and 537.<br>
Optionally, in addition to the HO_CONFIRM messages, the serving BS<br>
540 can transmit information needed for an operation of the MSS 500, stored<br>
therein, to the first and second target BSs 560 and 580 using backbone messages.<br>
Herein, the information needed for an operation of the MSS 500 refers to<br>
handover process optimization information such as service information of the<br>
MSS 500 and operational context information. Thereafter, the MSS 500, when it<br><br>
performs the handover to a BS included in the recommended list, can perform<br>
ranging with the corresponding BS for a fast ranging interval detected from a<br>
UL_MAP message. If a target BS to which the MSS 500 will be handed over has<br>
already acquired information on the MSS 500, the MSS 500 can perform a<br>
network re-entry process caused by handover more rapidly.<br>
Although it is illustrated in FIG. 5 that the first and second target BSs 560<br>
and 580 each transmit the Fast UL Ranging IE, after the MSS 500 performs<br>
carrier-to-interference and noise ratio (CINR) scanning on pilot channel signals<br>
from neighbor BSs in Step 533, the first and second target BSs 560 and 580 each<br>
can optionally transmit the Fast UL Ranging IE immediately after receiving the<br>
HO_CONFIRM messages. That is, the first target BS 560 can transmit the Fast<br>
UL Ranging IE to the MSS 500 after receiving the HO_CONFIRM message from<br>
the serving BS 540 in Step 525. Also, the second target BS 580 can transmit the<br>
Fast UL Ranging IE to the MSS 500 after receiving the HOCONFIRM message<br>
from the serving BS 540 in Step 529.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBBSHOREQ message with HO_option=l, the<br>
MSS 500 transmits a MOB HOJND message to the serving BS 540 in Step 531.<br>
Herein, a value recorded in a TargetBSID field of the MOBHO IND message<br>
can be either an identifier (ID) of a certain target BS or a value predefined<br>
between the target BS and the MSS 500. For example, 0x000000000000 or<br>
Oxffffffffffff can be used as the predefined value. When there are two or more<br>
recommended BSs for CINR scanning, the MSS 500 can write the predefined<br>
value in the TargetBSID field of the MOBHOIND message.<br>
The conventional MOBHO IND message was used when an MSS<br>
informs a serving BS of a selected final target BS to which it will be handed over.<br>
Conventionally, therefore, the serving BS must receive the MOBHOIND<br>
message to perform handover of the MSS. However, even when a serving BS fails<br>
to receive a MOB_HO_IND message defined in the system supporting fast<br>
handover of an MSS according to the present invention or the MSS does not<br>
transmit the redefined MOBHOIND message to the serving BS, the present<br>
invention enables the MSS to perform a handover because a value recorded in a<br>
TargetBSID field of the redefined MOBHOIND message may not be an ID<br><br>
of a final target BS to which the MSS will perform handover.<br>
After transmitting the MOBHOIND message, the MSS 500 performs<br>
CINR scanning on the BSs included in the recommended list in Step 533, and<br>
selects a best target BS (hereinafter referred to as a "new serving BS"). For<br>
example, if a CINR value for the second target BS 580 is the greatest among the<br>
scanned BSs, the MSS 500 can select the second target BS 580 as a new serving<br>
BS.<br>
In a method proposed by the present invention, because the MSS 500 is<br>
not required to transmit the MOBMSSHORSP message including CINR values<br>
for the recommended target BSs to the serving BS 540, after performing CINR<br>
scanning on pilot channel signals from the recommended target BSs, it is not<br>
necessary for the MSS 500 to perform CINR scanning on all BSs belonging to the<br>
recommended list. For example, assuming that there is a CINR threshold based<br>
on which the MSS 500 can perform handover, the MSS 500 first performs CINR<br>
scanning on the second target BS 580. If the scanning result value is sufficiently<br>
higher than the CINR threshold, such that a handover is possible, the MSS 500 is<br>
not required to perform CINR scanning on the first target BS 560.<br>
Therefore, the MSS 500 can read a Fast UL Ranging IE allocated thereto<br>
by checking a ULMAP message broadcasted by the second target BS 580 and<br>
start a network re-entry process by transmitting a Ranging Request (RNGREQ)<br>
message to the second target BS 580.<br>
In the network re-entry process, the MSS 500 returns to the serving BS<br>
540 after CINR scanning, acquires synchronization with the serving BS 540, and<br>
performs a ranging process, thereby reducing a time required for transmitting the<br>
MOBMSSHORSP message and the MOBJIOJND message. In addition, the<br>
MSS 500 starts the network re-entry process immediately after early completion<br>
of CINR scanning, without performing CINR scanning on all target BSs included<br>
in the recommended list, thereby contributing to additional time saving.<br>
After completing the CINR scanning, the MSS 500 receives the Fast UL<br>
Ranging IE transmitted by the second target BS 580 that is selected as a new<br><br>
serving BS in Step 537, and performs a network re-entry process with the second<br>
target BS 580 in Steps 539, 541, and 543.<br>
Upon receiving a request for authentication on the MSS 500 from the<br>
second target BS 580, which is a new serving BS of the MSS 500, the serving BS<br>
540 recognizes that the MSS 500 is performing handover to the second target BS<br>
580. The serving BS 540 transmits a handover withdraw (HO_WITHDRAW)<br>
message to each of the remaining recommended BSs in the recommended list (,<br>
except the second target BS 580, which is the new serving BS, in Step 545. A<br>
format of the HO WITHDRAW message is shown in Table 17.<br><br>
Because it is assumed in FIG. 5 that the recommended list includes the<br>
first target BS 560 and the second target BS 580, the HOWITHDRAW message<br>
is transmitted only to the first target BS 560.<br>
Upon receiving the HO_WITHDRAW message, the first target BS 560<br>
releases a reserved uplink resource by deleting the Fast UL Ranging IE for the<br>
MSS 500. The serving BS 540 can transmit the HO_WITHDRAW message at any<br>
time after the time at which it recognizes that the MSS 500 has selected the<br>
second target BS 580 as its final target BS.<br>
For example, the serving BS 540 can transmit the HO_WITHDRAW<br>
message using an authentication-related HMAC Tuple field included in the<br>
MOBHOIND message at the time when it responds to the request for<br><br>
authentication on the MSS 500 from the second target BS 580. Alternatively, if<br>
the MSS 500 completes the network re-entry process to the second target BS 580,<br>
which is its new serving BS, the serving BS 540 can transmit the<br>
HO_WITHDRAW message, upon receiving a backbone message that the second<br>
target BS 580 transmits to inform neighbor BSs of the completed handover of the<br>
MSS 500.<br>
Furthermore, if the first target BS 560 excluded from the handover<br>
target BSs fails to receive the RNGREQ message from the MSS 500 for a<br>
predetermined time, the MSS 500 may release the Fast UL Ranging IE allocated<br>
thereto. Although the old serving BS 540 transmits the HO_WITHDRAW<br>
message using the method of releasing the Fast UL Ranging IE in the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the message can be transmitted in another<br>
method.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a handover process of an MSS initiated<br>
by a BS in an IEEE 802.16e communication system according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, in step 611, the MSS receives a<br>
MOBBSHO REQ message for requesting handover from a serving BS. In step<br>
613, if a value recorded in a HO_option field included in the MOBBSHOREQ<br>
message is set to '1', the MSS recognizes that it can perform fast handover, and<br>
then performs steps 625 and the following process, which is a fast handover<br>
process. However, if the value recorded in the HO_option field is set to '0', the<br>
MSS performs step 615 and the following process, which is the conventional<br>
handover process.<br>
In step 615, the MSS performs CINR scanning on each of pilot channel<br>
signals from recommended BSs included in the MOBBSHOREQ message. In<br>
step 617, the MSS transmits a MOB_MSSHO_RSP message to its serving BS.<br>
Herein, the MOB_MSSHO_RSP message includes the CINR values for the<br>
scanned BSs.<br>
In step 619, the MSS selects a new serving BS among the scanned BSs.<br>
For example, the MSS can select a BS, a CINR value for which is greatest, as the<br>
new serving BS. In step 621, the MSS transmits a MOB_HO_IND message<br><br>
including a predefined value between the MSS and the serving BS. Herein, the<br>
MSS may not transmits the MOBHOIND message to the serving BS.<br>
In step 633, the MSS acquires synchronization with the new serving BS,<br>
and acquires network re-entry process-related information by receiving a<br>
UL_MAP message. For example, the MSS can perform a ranging process with<br>
the new serving BS on a contention-free basis by detecting a Fast UL Ranging IE<br>
included in the UL_MAP message. In step 635, the MSS performs a network re-<br>
entry process with the selected target BS, i.e., the new serving BS, to resume a<br>
communication service.<br>
Alternatively, in step 625, the MSS transmits a MOBHOIND message<br>
with HO_IND_type=0 and Target_BS_ID='predefined value' to the serving BS.<br>
Herein, the predefined value means, for example, 0x000000000000 or<br>
Oxffffffffffff other than one of IDs of BSs supporting fast handover. That is, the<br>
MSS can select a random BS among BSs supporting fast handover and set the<br>
TargetBSID to an ID value of the selected BS.<br>
In step 629, the MSS performs CINR scanning on the target BSs<br>
recommended by the serving BS. In step 631, the MSS selects a new serving BS<br>
according to the scanning result, and then performs steps 633 and 635. The MSS<br>
can select the new serving BS by performing CINR scanning on each of the<br>
recommended BSs.<br>
Alternatively, the MSS can perform CINR scanning on a random<br>
recommended BS and, if the scanning result satisfies a predetermined condition,<br>
select the random recommended BS as the new serving BS after stopping CINR<br>
scanning on the remaining recommended BSs.<br>
»	FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a serving BS during a<br>
handover initiated by a BS in an IEEE 802.16e communication system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, in step 711, the<br>
serving BS detects a need for handover of a particular MSS. In step 713, the<br>
serving BS transmits a HOPRENOTIFICATION message to each of neighbor<br>
BSs to determine if the neighbor BSs can support a service level requested by the<br><br>
MSS. In step 715, the serving BS generates a recommended-BS list using<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE messages received from the neighbor<br>
BSs in response to the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION message. In step 717, if the<br>
serving BS can support fast handover for the MSS, the serving BS proceeds to<br>
step 727. However, if the serving BS cannot support fast handover for the MSS, it<br>
proceeds to step 719.<br>
In step 719, the serving BS transmits a MOB BSHOREQ message<br>
including the generate recommended-BS list and service level prediction (SLP)<br>
information of each of the recommended BSs to the MSS. In step 721, the serving<br>
BS receives an MOBMSSHORSP message including CINR canning result for<br>
each of the recommended BSs from the MSS. In step 723, the serving BS<br>
receives an MOBHOIND message including an ID of a target BS selected by<br>
the MSS, i.e., a new serving BS. In step 725, the serving BS transmits a<br>
HOCONFIRM message to the new serving BS. In step 741, the serving BS<br>
releases information on a connection set up to the MSS or retains the connection<br>
information for a predetermined time.<br>
In step 727, the serving BS transmits a MOBBSHO REQ message<br>
including the generated recommended-BS list and SLP information of each of the<br>
recommended BSs to the MSS. A HOoption field in the MOBBSHOREQ<br>
message is set to '1'.<br>
In step 729, the serving BS transmits a HOCONFIRM message to each<br>
of the recommended BSs. In step 731, the serving BS receives a MOBHOIND<br>
message from the MSS. In step 733, the serving BS recognizes that the MSS has<br>
selected a new serving BS. As described above, a time at which the serving BS<br>
transmits a HOWITHDRAW message is possible any time after the time at<br>
which it recognizes that the MSS has selected the new serving BS. Therefore, the<br>
serving BS can transmit the HOWITHDRAW message using an authentication-<br>
related HMAC Tuple field included in the MOBHOIND message at the time<br>
when it responds to a request for authentication on the MSS from the new serving<br>
BS selected by the MSS.<br>
Alternatively, if the MSS completes a network re-entry process to the new<br><br>
serving BS, the new serving BS transmits a backbone message indicating the<br>
completed handover of the MSS to each of neighbor BSs. The serving BS can<br>
also transmit the HOWITHDRAW message to BSs in the recommended-BS list,<br>
except the new serving BS, upon receiving the backbone message. Therefore, in<br>
step 735, the serving BS selects BSs, not including the final target BS, among the<br>
BSs in the recommended-BS list.<br>
In step 737, the serving BS transmits the HOWITHDRAW message to<br>
the selected BSs, i.e., target BSs. Upon receiving the HO_WITHDRAW message,<br>
the target BSs release a Fast UL Ranging IE allocated to the MSS, and delete any<br>
handover process information of the MSS stored therein.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a target BS during<br>
handover initiated by a BS in an IEEE 802.16e communication system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 8, in step 811, the<br>
target BS receives a HOPRENOTIFICATION message for requesting SLP for<br>
.a particular MSS from a serving BS. In step 813, the target BS transmits a<br>
HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message to the serving BS in response<br>
to the HO_PRE_NOTIFICATION message. In step 815, the target BS receives a<br>
HO_CONFIRM message from the serving BS. In step 817, the target BS<br>
transmits a UL_MAP message including a Fast UL Ranging IE to the MSS.<br>
In step 819, the target BS determines if it receives a HO_WITHDRAW<br>
message from the serving BS. If it is determined that the HOWITHDRAW<br>
message is received, the target BS proceeds to step 821 where it releases the Fast<br>
UL Ranging IE allocated to the MSS.<br>
However, upon failure to receive the HOWITHDRAW message, the<br>
target BS determines in step 823 if it receives an RNG_REQ message from the<br>
MSS. If it is determined that the RNG_REQ message is received, the target BS<br>
proceeds to step 825, where it transmits an RNG_RSP message to the MSS in<br>
response to the RNGREQ message.<br>
In step 827, the target BS performs a network re-entry process except a<br>
ranging process, with the MSS.<br><br>
Upon failure to receive the RNG_REQ message in step 823, the target BS<br>
proceeds to step 824, where it determines if a timer set for releasing a Fast UL<br>
Ranging IE has expired. If it is determined that the timer has expired, the target<br>
BS proceeds to step 821, where it releases the Fast UL Ranging IE. However, if<br>
the timer has not expired yet, the target BS returns to step 819 where it awaits a<br>
HO_WITHDRAW message.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, a proposed BWA<br>
communication system using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme supports fast handover<br>
to an MSS at the handover request of a serving BS to omit a part of the<br>
conventional handover process, thereby contributing to a reduction in handover<br>
processing time. More specifically, it is possible to exclude one process in which<br>
the MSS transmits a handover response message to the serving BS and another<br>
process in which the MSS acquires synchronization with the serving BS and<br>
performs ranging with the serving BS after performing CINR scanning to transmit<br>
the handover response message. The exclusion of these processes reduces the<br>
time required for the processes, thereby reducing the overall time required for the<br>
handover process initiated by the BS.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
