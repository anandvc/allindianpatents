METHODS FOR DESIGNING MULTEFOCAL OPHTHALMIC LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the invention<br>
provides lenses that use more than one optical power, or focal length, and are useful<br>
in the correction of presbyopia.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As an individual ages, the eye is less able to accommodate, or bend the<br>
natural lens, to focus on objects that are relatively near to the observer. This<br>
condition is known as presbyopia. Additionally, for persons who have had their<br>
natural lens removed and an intraocular lens inserted as a replacement, the ability to<br>
accommodate is totally absent.<br>
Among the methods used to correct for the eye's failure to accommodate is<br>
the mono-vision system in which a person is fitted with one contact lens for distance<br>
vision and one lens for near vision. The mono-vision system permits the lens wearer<br>
to distinguish both distance and near objects, but is disadvantageous in that a<br>
substantial loss in depth perception results.<br>
In another type of multifocal contact lenses, the optic zone of each lens is<br>
provided with more than one power. For example, the optic zone may have both<br>
distance and near power, which the eye uses simultaneously.<br>
Neither of these methods provides good results in terms of visual acuity and<br>
lens wearer satisfaction. Thus, a need exists for lenses that both provide correction<br>
for the wearer's inability to accommodate and that overcome some or all of the<br>
disadvantages of known lenses.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides methods for designing lenses useful for correcting<br>
presbyopia, lenses incorporating such designs, and methods for producing these<br>
lenses. In one embodiment, the method of the invention permits multifocal zones of<br>
near vision power and distance vision power to be varied as to amplitude, position,<br>
and width. The result of this variation is that there is a better distribution of the<br>
distance and near vision powers within the multifocal zone and, thus, improved<br>
visual acuity and wearer satisfaction.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a multifocal ophthalmic lens<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of an optic zone comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, and consisting of one or more multifocal power zones<br>
wherein a position, an amplitude, and a width for the zone is determined by the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
4 <br><br>
Y is the Add power at any point x on a surface;<br>
x is a point on the lens surface;<br>
a is 0.5;<br>
k is the point within the power zone at which the power peaks;<br>
P is the coefficient that controls the width of the power zone and is greater than<br>
about 0 and less than about 15;<br>
S is the coefficient that controls the amplitude and its decrease in the periphery of<br>
the zone and is greater than about 0 and less than about 30; and<br>
Add is a value that is equal to or less than the difference in power between the near<br>
vision power and distance vision power of the lens.<br>
For purposes of the invention, by "ophthalmic lens" is meant a contact lens,<br>
intraocular lens, or the like. Preferably, the lenses of the invention are contact<br>
lenses. By "position" is meant the power zone position in reference to the pupil. By<br>
"amplitude" is meant the extent or range of the power progression within the power<br>
zone. By "distance vision power" is meant the amount of refractive power required<br>
to correct the wearer's distance vision acuity to the desired degree. By "near vision<br>
power" is meant the amount of refractive power required to correct the wearer's near<br>
vision acuity to the desired degree.<br>
In the lenses of the invention, the multifocal power zones may be on the<br>
object-side, or front, surface, the eye-side, or rear, surface, or both surfaces. The<br>
multifocal power zones have at least two regions of differing power alternating<br>
between distance and near vision power, and preferably three regions alternating<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
5<br>
between distance, near, and intermediate vision power. Each of the distance and<br>
near power regions may be of the same or of a different power from the other<br>
distance and near regions. Intermediate power may be supplied as a consequence of<br>
the power progression between the peak of the power of the near and distance vision<br>
regions. Alternatively, a region of intermediate power may also be designed using<br>
Equation I.<br>
The multifocal power zone may occur at any point within the optic zone of<br>
the lens. The multifocal power zone is coaxial, the common axis being the Z axis<br>
and preferably rotationally symmetric. In the lenses of the invention, the distance,<br>
near, and intermediate optical powers are spherical or toric powers. Additionally,<br>
the distance, near, and intermediate optical power zones may be of any desired and<br>
practical dimensions.<br>
In Fig. 1 is graphically depicted the power progression in four different<br>
multifocal power zone designs. In each design, the near vision power is at the center<br>
of the zone and the distance vision power is at or towards the periphery of the zone.<br>
By periphery is meant the region or area farthest from the center of the zone. The<br>
values used in Equation I for each of the designs is set forth in the following Table<br>
1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Add	Design A	Design B	Design C	Design D<br><br>
	2.50 D	2.50 D	2.50 D	2.50 D<br>
a	0.50	0.50	0.50	0.50<br>
k	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0<br>
P	1.0	2.5	5.0	10.0<br>
S	2.000	2.000	2.000	2.000<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
6<br>
In FIG. 2 is graphically depicted the power progression in a multifocal power<br>
zone having five power regions. The composite design of Fig. 2 is achieved by<br>
taking the sum of the values generated by using Equation I in the two cases as<br>
follows:<br>
Table 2<br><br>
	Case A	CaseB<br>
Add	2.50 D	2.50 D<br>
A	0.50	0.50<br>
K	-1.5	-2.5<br>
P	3.5	5.0<br>
S	4.000	6.283<br>
Use of the composite design provides a simple method for creating multifocal power<br>
zones in which the characteristics of the inner power regions, meaning the regions<br>
nearest to the geometric center of the lens, differ from those of the outer, or<br>
peripheral, regions.<br>
In FIG. 3 is graphically depicted the power progression of a multi-region<br>
composite design in which the Add differs from one near vision power region to the<br>
other. The composite design was achieved by taking the sum of the values<br>
generated by using Equation I in the two cases as follows:<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Add	Case C	Case D<br><br>
	2.50 D	1.75 D<br>
A	0.50	0.50<br>
K	-1.5	-2.5<br>
P	3.5	5.0<br>
S	4.000	6.283<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
7<br>
The advantage of this design is that it may result in an improvement of night vision<br>
in the lens wearer because the near vision power decreases in the peripheral portions<br>
of the optic zone.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention a method for designing lenses, and<br>
lenses made by this method, are provided in which the rate of change and contour of<br>
the power change from distance to near and near to distance vision power is varied.<br>
In this embodiment, the invention provides a multifocal ophthalmic lens comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, and consisting of an optic zone comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of near vision power and distance vision power,<br>
wherein a rate of change and a contour of a power change between the distance near<br>
vision powers is determined according to an equation selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
Power = A-((1-P)x)*A<br>
(II)<br>
and<br>
Power = ((1-P)x)*A<br>
(III)<br>
wherein :<br>
A is the Add power;<br>
P is the pupil fraction from 0 to 1; and<br>
X is greater than 0, preferably greater than 1, and more preferably 2, n, or 2n.<br>
For purposes of Equation II and III, P is determined as follows. The<br>
maximum and minimum pupil diameters are selected along with interval steps from<br>
the minimum to the maximum. The interval steps selected are at the designers<br>
discretion, but preferably are suitable to facilitate production of the lens as, for<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
8<br>
example, by computer numerical controlled lathe. From the maximum diameter, the<br>
percentage of total diameter P is defined.<br>
Equation II is used for center distance lens designs meaning that the distance<br>
vision power is in the center of the optic zone and the near vision power is at the<br>
optic zone's periphery. Equation HI is used for center near lens designs, or lenses in<br>
which the near vision power is in the center and the distance vision is at the<br>
periphery.<br>
Alternatively, and as yet another embodiment of the invention, the rate of<br>
change and contour of the power change from distance to near and near to distance<br>
vision power is varied using one of the following equations:<br>
Power = A- | Sin(t)x | * A<br>
(IV)<br>
and<br>
Power = | Sin(t)x | *A<br>
(V)<br>
wherein:<br>
A is the Add power;<br>
t is the pupil fraction from 90 to 180 degrees; and<br>
X is greater than 0, preferably greater than 1, and more preferably 2, π, or 2π.<br>
For purposes of Equation IV and V, t is determined by selection of the<br>
maximum and minimum pupil diameters. The minimum diameter is assigned a<br>
value of 90 degrees and the maximum diameter of 180 degrees, in linear intervals.<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
9<br>
Equation TV is used for center distance designs and Equation V is used for<br>
center near lenses. Thus, in yet another embodiment, the invention provides a<br>
multifocal ophthalmic lens comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of<br>
an optic zone comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of near vision<br>
power and distance vision power wherein a rate of change and a contour of a power<br>
change between the distance near vision powers is determined according to and<br>
equation selected from the group consisting of:<br>
Power = A- | Sin(t)x | * A<br>
(IV)<br>
and<br>
Power = | Sin(t)x | * A<br>
(V)<br>
wherein :<br>
A is the Add power;<br>
t is the pupil fraction from 90 to 180 degrees; and<br>
X is greater than 0, preferably greater than 1, and more preferably 2, π, or 2π.<br>
In Fig. 4 is graphically depicted the power progression for a variety of<br>
designs. Designs A through D are calculated using Equation III and E through G<br>
using equation V. Both equations map the same interval (0,1) and start and end at<br>
the same values (A and 0). However, because Sin(t) is not a linear function, the<br>
progression rate generated differs. Thus, using one equation instead of the other<br>
enables the amount of Add power for a given pupil size to be changed, similar to<br>
Equations II and IV.<br><br>
WO 03/016985	PCT/US02/24024<br>
10<br>
The designs of the invention are useful in producing contact lenses that are<br>
hard or soft lenses. Soft contact lenses, made of any material suitable for producing<br>
such lenses, preferably are used. The lenses of the invention may have any of a<br>
variety of corrective optical characteristics incorporated onto the surfaces in addition<br>
to distance and near optical powers, such as, for example, cylinder power.<br>
The lenses of the invention may be formed by any conventional method. For<br>
example, the multifocal zones formed therein may produced by diamond-turning<br>
using alternating radii. The zones may be diamond-turned into the molds that are<br>
used to form the lens of the invention. Subsequently, a suitable liquid resin is placed<br>
between the molds followed by compression and curing of the resin to form the<br>
lenses of the invention. Alternatively, the zones may be diamond-turned into lens<br>
buttons.<br><br>
