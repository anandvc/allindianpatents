				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to "smart packaging" systems and methods,<br>
and more particularly to electronic detection devices, such as radio frequency<br>
identification devices ("RFID" tags or devices hereinafter) and methods of using<br>
these devices in packaging and package tracking systems.<br>
Monitoring the location and status of items is advantageous in many<br>
applications. For example, in manufacturing environments it is important to know<br>
the whereabouts of items in a factory, and in transportation environments it is<br>
important to identify and document the coming and going of items from a<br>
warehouse or the like. Bar codes have traditionally been used to identify and<br>
track items. In particular, ID bar codes are most common and are used to identify<br>
items at the grocery store, etc. More recently, 2D bar codes have been developed<br>
and provide substantially more information than ID bar codes. Thus, 2D bar<br>
codes are used with shipping labels and other items where more information is<br>
typically needed to identify the item(s) associated with the bar code. However,<br>
ID and 2D bar code systems are often not compatible with one another, and the<br>
bar code must be clearly visible and readable by a scanner or the like in order to<br>
transfer the information associated with the bar code.<br>
Another method for tracking an item and/or transferring information about<br>
an item is through a magnetic strip having pre-programmed coded information<br>
that is attached to an outer surface of an item. The information is read by passing<br>
the magnetic strip through a high-resolution magnetic reader to produce an<br>
electric field. While this technology does not require a clear line-of-sight between<br>
the reader and the strip for proper reading of the information, the distance at<br><br>
which the strip can be read is limited, and the system is limited to read-only. The<br>
magnetic strips are also prone to damage, which can be a problem for longer<br>
magnetic strips that contain more data.<br>
Another way to track items is through the use of RFID. RFID has been<br>
used for some time in a variety of applications, from tracking garments to pallets<br>
to trucks. RFID works on an inductive principle. In a passive RFID system, a<br>
reader generates a magnetic field at a predetermined frequency. When a RFID<br>
tag, which can be usually categorized as being read-only or read/write, enters the<br>
magnetic field, a small electric current forms in the tag's resonant circuit, which<br>
includes a coiled antenna and a capacitor. This circuit provides power to the<br>
RFID tag, which then modulates the magnetic field in order to transmit<br>
information that is pre-programmed on the tag back to the reader at a<br>
predetermined frequency, such as 125kHz (low frequency) or 13.56MHz (high<br>
frequency). The reader then receives, demodulates, and decodes the signal<br>
transmission, and then sends the data onto a host computer associated with the<br>
system for further processing.<br>
An active RFID system operates in much the same way, but in an active<br>
system the RFID tag includes its own battery, allowing the tag to transmit data<br>
and information at the touch of a button. For example, a remote control garage<br>
door opener typically uses an active RFID tag that transmits a predetermined code<br>
to the receiver in order to raise and lower the garage door at the user's discretion.<br>
Another technology that is related to RFID tags is known as Bistatix, which<br>
operates much the same way as RFID tags except that the coiled antenna and<br>
capacitor of the RFID tags have been replaced by a printed, carbon-based<br>
material. As a result, a Bistatix tag is extremely flat and relatively flexible,<br>
although currently these types of devices are limited to a frequency range of about<br>
125KHz. In addition, the read range of a Bistatix tag is dependent on size, so for<br>
long read ranges a very large tag may be required. Regardless, whether a Bistatix,<br>
active, or passive RFID tag is used in a particular tracking system, these tags and<br>
systems have greatly advanced package tracking and data management.<br>
One of the challenges that exist with electronic detection devices, and with<br>
RFID systems in particular, is how to apply a RFID tag to an item. Currently tags<br><br>
are glued to an outer surface of a container or pallet, and while this method is<br>
satisfactory for many applications, the prominent location of the tag often leaves<br>
the tag exposed and subject to damage or inadvertent removal during processing.<br>
Other types of tag applications include sewing tags into a garment and clipping<br>
tags to an item with metal fasteners. The difficulties in applying a detection<br>
device is particularly pronounced when applying such devices or tags to tubular<br>
rolls or containers, such as those used in supporting roll goods or for packaging<br>
food products, as these types of structures often rub against one another during<br>
production and thereby cause damage to the tags. In addition, reusable carriers or<br>
containers are often used for many cycles, such as in doffing and creeling textile<br>
yarn, which can further accelerate damage to the RFID tag. Thus, there is a need<br>
to manufacture a container or carrier having an electronic detection device that<br>
will not be damaged or destroyed during processing.<br>
Another problem facing RFID technology is the cost associated with<br>
wasting RFID tags, particularly when used with objects with a relatively short<br>
lifespan. For example, tubular core that are used with roll goods are often made<br>
out of paperboard stock and are recycled after being damaged or worn.<br>
Conventional RFID tags that are glued to the core are destroyed when the core is<br>
recycled, even though the tag can be used for a much longer period. Thus, there is<br>
a need for an RFID tag that can be recycled when the lifespan of the object it is<br>
associated with is over.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other needs are provided by the tubular structure and methods of<br>
forming the tubular structure according to the present invention. Advantageously,<br>
the tubular structure of the present invention includes a tubular core and an<br>
electronic detection or identification device, such as a radio frequency<br>
identification device or tag, which is releasably associated with the tubular core by<br>
a resiliently flexible band or sheet. The flexible band is biased against the inside<br>
of the core or about the outer surface of the core, and the detection device is<br>
interposed between the band and the core. In this manner, the detection device is<br>
protected from damage by the band, and the detection device can be removed<br><br>
from the core if the core is recycled or the like. In another embodiment, the<br>
detection device is attached to the flexible sheet that is itself biased against the<br>
inner surface of the core and held in place by a frictional or interference fit. The<br>
sheet and detection device can be removed when the core is recycled.<br>
Methods of manufacturing tubular structures for storing products are also<br>
provided, wherein the resiliently flexible sheet or band is biased to form an<br>
interference fit with the tubular core. A detection device is in contact with the<br>
flexible sheet or band, and is releasably secured during the biasing step.<br>
The tubular structure of the present invention has many uses. Because the<br>
identification device is protected by the flexible band or sheet, there is less risk of<br>
damage or breakage from being hit or bumped during processing of the products<br>
or movement of the core. In addition, the flexible band or sheet and the<br>
identification device can be removed, such as if the core is recycled. The tubular<br>
structure is particularly useful for tracking products that are stored on or therein,<br>
such as cookies, potato crisps, roll goods, and the like. The methods of the<br>
present invention do not require special construction techniques, end caps, or<br>
special grooves cut into portions of the tubular structure, all of which can decrease<br>
manufacturing efficiency and increase manufacturing costs.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments<br>
of the invention are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many<br>
different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set<br>
forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will<br>
satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements<br>
throughout.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show a tubular structure 10 for storing goods or products<br>
11 according to one embodiment of the present invention that comprises a tubular<br>
core 12 having inner and outer surfaces 18, 20 and opposed ends 14,16. Such<br>
tubular bodies are used as containers for packaging products, such as cookies and<br>
potato crisps, and as winding cores for supporting products wound around the<br>
outer surface of the tube, such as textiles, paper goods, and the like (as shown in<br>
Figure 1). The term "tubular structure" is used herein to denote both containers<br>
and winding cores, noting that the advantageous features of the present invention<br>
may exist in each type of tubular body.<br>
In one embodiment, the tubular core 12 is formed from multiple plies or<br>
layers of flexible material, such as paperboard, wrapped one upon another about<br>
an axis of the tubular core and adhered together in a radially layered construction.<br>
The tubular core 12 can also be formed from other materials, such as plastics or<br>
composite materials. The inner surface 18 of the tubular core 12 defines an inner<br>
diameter D1, while the outer surface 20 defines an outer diameter D2. The<br>
thickness of the tubular core 12 is primarily a function of the products stored in or<br>
on the core, as well as the processing and use of the core. As such, the thickness<br>
of the core 12 may be from about 0.1 inch to about 3.0 inches, although the<br>
thickness may be greater or less than this range as desired. The length of the core<br><br>
12 is also subject to the particular use of the core and the products associated<br>
therewith. Typically, containers for packaging products are about 1 foot in length,<br>
while cores used with roll goods can be up to 5 feet and longer. The features and<br>
advantages of the tubular structure 10, however, can be achieved regardless of the<br>
particular thickness and length of the core 12. Figure 1 also shows a resiliency<br>
flexible band or sheet 30 for securing an electronic detection or identification<br>
device 40, as discussed below.<br>
More specifically, Figure 3 shows a resiliency flexible band or sheet 30<br>
that is releasably secured to the core 12 in one of several ways. In particular, the<br>
band 30 has opposing side edges 33, 35 and inner and outer surfaces 36, 38. The<br>
band 30 may be formed from a variety of materials, including polymers, metals,<br>
composites, and fibrous materials, such as paperboard. It should be noted that the<br>
term "band" and the term "sheet" refer to the same structure and can be<br>
interchanged. However, the terms will be used in a manner that reflects a<br>
particular arrangement most accurately. In this regard, the band 30 shown in<br>
Figure 3 is curled into a generally cylindrical form so that the opposing side edges<br>
33, 35 are proximate one another. It is possible that the side edges 33, 35 may be<br>
in contact with one another, although preferably a small gap is present<br>
therebetween. The band 30 forms an inner diameter D3 and an outer diameter D4<br>
that are sized according to the particular application.<br>
For example, in one embodiment the inner diameter D3 of the band 30 is<br>
sized to be less than the outer diameter D2 of the core 12, such that when the band<br>
is stretched or biased about the core, the side edges 33,35 spread slightly and an<br>
interference or frictional fit is formed between the band and core. In this example,<br>
the identification device 40 is interposed between the inner surface 36 of the band<br>
30 and the outer surface 20 of the core 12 and is held in place by the interference<br>
fit. In another example, the outer diameter D4 of the band 30 is sized to be<br>
slightly more than the inner diameter D1 of the core 12, such that when the band<br>
is compressed or biased within the core, the side edges 33, 35 draw nearer one<br>
another and an interference fit is formed between the band and the core. In this<br>
example, the identification device 40 is interposed between the outer surface 38 of<br>
the band 30 and the inner surface 18 of the core 12 and held in place by the<br><br>
interference fit. In each example, the band 30 (and preferably the identification<br>
device 40) can be inserted into or about the core 12 at any position along the<br>
length of the core, yet still be removed from the core 12 and reused in other<br>
applications. The band 30 may also be color-coded or include text to more easily<br>
identify the particular products, core, customer, or other such information.<br>
The identification device 40 is preferably a radio frequency identification<br>
(RFID) device that is capable of storing and transmitting data associated with the<br>
tubular structure 10, the products 11 stored in or on the structure, or both.<br>
Examples of such data and other data that can be stored, transmitted to and from,<br>
and deleted from the identification device 40 includes product ID, technical data,<br>
quality control information, code dating, location, and order status. Information<br>
can also be deleted, which includes overwriting, erasing, substituting, and<br>
disabling, so that the identification device 40 can be re-used for additional<br>
products or goods. These types of features allow for improved inventory<br>
management, inventory control, in-house product location, and supply chain<br>
management.<br>
The identification device 40 can have many shapes and configurations, but<br>
according to one embodiment the device is relatively thin and flat, and includes a<br>
coiled antenna and a capacitor that respond to magnetic fields, such as presented<br>
by radio frequency transmitters. Such RFID devices or tags are known and<br>
available from a variety of manufacturers, such as Motorola® and Texas<br>
Instruments®. The coiled antenna of the identification device 40 is typically<br>
made from metal, although printed carbon-based materials may also be used. As<br>
discussed above, the location of the identification device 40 is determined by the<br>
location of the flexible band or sheet 30, although preferably the identification<br>
device 40 is located near one of the ends 14,16 of the core 12 so that it can be<br>
easily removed and be in more direct proximity to surrounding electronic<br>
transmitters.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate alternative arrangements between the core 12,<br>
band 30, and identification device 40. In particular, Figure 4 shows one<br>
embodiment of the band 30 whereby the band includes opposing flanges 37 at the<br>
ends 32, 34 thereof. The flanges 37 include sides 37a and 37b, which are shown<br><br>
as being approximately perpendicular to one another, although the angle formed<br>
by the sides can be different, including a more curved transition between the sides.<br>
The sides 37b, however, form the interference fit between the band 30 and the<br>
inner surface 18 of the core 12, so enough surface area of the sides 37b must be<br>
presented as well as sufficient diameter of the band 30 in order to accomplish<br>
sufficient friction. The sides 37 define the outer surface 38 of the band 30 as a<br>
relief or recess, and the identification device 40 is positioned in the recess and is<br>
held between the sides 37. Depending on the depth of the recess and the thickness<br>
of the identification device 40, the identification device may be free to move<br>
freely about the recess.<br>
Figure 5 shows another embodiment of the band 30 whereby the band<br>
includes a flange 43 that includes surface 45 that fits against one end 16 of the<br>
core 12 and prevents further insertion of the band 30 into the core. Preferably, the<br>
surface 45 extends radially no greater than the outer surface 20 of the core 12 and<br>
is flush therewith, although the surface 45 may extend greater or less than the<br>
outer surface of the core, depending on the needs and circumstances.<br>
Advantageously, the flange 43 may include color and/or text so that information<br>
can be easily seen. In addition, the flange 43 assists in easy removal of the band<br>
30 from the core 12, as well as indicating that the core 12 has a band 30 already<br>
inserted therein. As described generally above, the identification device 40 is<br>
interposed between the band 30 and the inner surface 18 of the core 12 and is held<br>
by the interference fit between the band and the core.<br>
Figures 6-10 illustrate various methods of installing the band 30 and<br>
identification device 40 in conjunction with the tubular structure 10 of the present<br>
invention. In addition, Figures 6-10 illustrate how the core 12, band 30, and<br>
identification device 40 can be recycled or reused for future applications.<br>
Referring specifically to Figure 6, step 6A includes attaching or placing the<br>
identification device 40 to the band 30, such as by positioning the identification<br>
device against the inside surface 36 of the band. Step 6B includes positioning the<br>
band 30 and identification device 40 about the outer surface 20 of the core 12 such<br>
that the identification device is interposed between the band and the core. Step<br>
6C includes winding the material or product 11 about core 12 and over the band<br><br>
30. Step 6D includes using the product 11 or otherwise removing a majority of<br>
the product. If any leftover product remains, step 6E includes removing the<br>
excess or leftover product 11 so that the band 30 is exposed. Step 6F includes<br>
sliding or otherwise removing the band 30 and identification device 40 from the<br>
core 12, whereafter the core may be repulped or recycled, and the band 30 and<br>
identification device 40 may be reused in future applications. During the steps of<br>
Figure 6, information can be stored, transferred, and deleted from the<br>
identification device 40 as is known in the art. Advantageously, the band 30<br>
protects the identification device 40 from damage and abuse during the process<br>
steps and transportation. This is particularly advantageous when the leftover<br>
material or product is removed, as typically the removal is performed by cutting<br>
the material from the core 12 using a knife, which could damage the identification<br>
device 40 if not for the band 30.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates another method according to the present invention,<br>
wherein Figure 7A includes attaching or positioning the identification device 40 to<br>
the outer surface 38 of the band 30. Step 7B includes positioning the band 30 and<br>
the identification device 40 inside the core 12 such that the identification device is<br>
interposed between the outer surface 38 of the band 30 and the inner surface 18 of<br>
the core 12. Step 7C includes winding the material or product 11 about core 12.<br>
Step 7D includes using the product 11 as described above, which depletes the<br>
product remaining on the core 12. Step 7E includes removing the excess or<br>
leftover product 11, and step 7F includes sliding or otherwise removing the band<br>
30 and identification device 40 from the core 12 in order to facilitate reuse and/or<br>
recycling.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates another embodiment according to the present invention,<br>
wherein steps 8A-8F are performed in a manner described above for Figure 7, but<br>
in this embodiment the band 30 includes the opposing flanges 37 so that the<br>
identification device 40 is located in the recess defined by the outer surface 38 and<br>
the flanges 37 of the band. Similarly, Figure 9 illustrates another embodiment of<br>
the present invention, wherein steps 9A-9F are performed in a manner described<br>
above for Figure 7, but in this embodiment the band 30 includes the flange 43 that<br>
registers with the end 16 of the core 12 as described above wherein the<br><br>
identification device 40 is interposed between the band 30 and the inner surface<br>
18 of the core 12.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates yet another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
While most of the steps 10A-10F are similar to the steps of Figures 6-9, the<br>
identification device 40 in this embodiment is attached to a resiliently flexible<br>
sheet 30 that has opposing ends 32, 34 and side edges 33, 35. The distance<br>
between the side edges 33,35 of the sheet 30 is greater than the inner diameter D1<br>
of the core 12, so in order the position the sheet 30 inside the core, the sheet is<br>
biased, e.g., bowed, compressed, squeezed, or the like, so that the opposing side<br>
edges 33,35 are biased against the inner surface 18 of the core 12 and releasably<br>
secured thereto by an interference fit. The natural tendency of the sheet 30 to<br>
straighten to an unbiased shape maintains the interference fit with the core 12.<br>
The identification device 40 is attached to one side 36 of the sheet 30, such as by<br>
adhesive or the like, and can be removed from the sheet at the end of the process<br>
cycle, as shown in step 10F.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an advantageous system for<br>
recording information about products and or structures relating thereto. The<br>
flexible sheet or band 30 provides protection to the identification device 40 while<br>
also being able to convey information itself by including color and/or text in the<br>
design of the band 30. The present invention limits the amount of waste by<br>
allowing the band and identification device to be recycled or reused for future<br>
applications, while the core 12 may be repulped or recycled independently.<br>
Because the lifespan of the core 12 is significantly less than that of the<br>
identification device 40 and band 30, the present invention reduces cost in the<br>
production of new cores. At the same time, the present invention allows for a new<br>
