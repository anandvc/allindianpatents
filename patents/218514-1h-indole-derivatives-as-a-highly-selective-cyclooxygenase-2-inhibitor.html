1H-INDOLE  DERIVATIVES  AS A HIGHLY   SELECTIVE CYCLOOXYGENASE-2   INHIBITOR<br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
The     present     invention     relates     to     lH-indole derivatives    as    a    highly    selective    cyclooxygenase-2<br>
inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Most of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs represent actions such as anti-inflammation, ataralgesia, defervescence by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin G/H synthase. In addition, they can suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. First, only cyclooxygenase-1 was known to be found in cow as a constitutional enzyme. But recently, cyclooxygenase-2 is elucidated as an induced form. Cyclooxygenase-2 is identified to be discriminated clearly from cyclooxygenase-1 and can be provoked easily by mitogen, endotoxin, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the<br>
like-Pros taglandins  have  various  pathological  and physiological functions. Precisely, cvclooxvaenase-1 as<br><br>
a constitutional enzyme participates in the secretion of basic endogenous prostaglandin and plays an important role in physiological aspects such as stomach homeostasis, renal blood circulation and so on. On the other hand, cyclooxygenase-2 is induced by inflammatory factors, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the like and thus plays an important role in pathological effects of prostaglandins. Therefore, selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 are expected to have no side effect on account of the functional mechanism compared with the anti-inflammatory drugs such as conventional non-steroid agents and to represent actions such as anti-inflammation, ataralgesia and defervescence. Furthermore, it is estimated to suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. Especially, it probably has lesser side effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity and the like. Also, it is assumed to prevent the synthesis of contractive prostanoids and thus inhibit the contraction of smooth muscle induced by the prostanoid. Hence, it can be applied usefully to treat a premature birth, dysmenorrhea, asthma and several diseases associated with eosinophilic leukocytes. Besides, it can be exploited widely to cure osteoporosis, glaucoma and athymia, which has been disclosed  in a  lot  of references,  especially the<br><br>
usefulness of selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 (References: John Vane, " Towards a better aspirin " in Nature, Vol. 367, pp 215-216, 1994; Bruno Battistini, Regina Botting and Y. S. Bakhle, " COX-1 and COX-2; Toward the Development of More Selective NSAIDs " in Drug News and Perspectives, Vol. 7, pp 501-512, 1994; David B- Reitz and Karen Seibert, " Selective Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors " in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, James A. Bristol, Editor, Vol. 30, pp 179-188, 1995).<br>
The selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 have been reported to have various structural forms. Among these, the diaryl heterocycle structure, namely a tricyclic system, has been studied most frequently and exploited to construct a lot of candidate substances. In this structure, it is essential that sulfonamide or methanesulfone group exist onto one phenyl group. The initial substance of such a structure is identified to be Dup697 (Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 5, No. 18, p 2123, 1995). Then, as a derivative, SC-58635 (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 40, p 1347, 1997) having a pyrrazole structure, MK-966 (WO 95/00501) having a furanone structure and the like are disclosed.<br><br>

Experimental     Example&gt;     The     activity      of      selective inhibition against cyclot»xyqenase-2<br><br>
(1)   Experimental procedure<br>
In order to investigate the activity of the present compound for the selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pharmacologically, the enzymatic activities inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 were measured quantitatively.<br>
First of all, the cyclooxygenase-1 was examined through the following procedure,<br>
Peritoneal fluid in which macrophages were suspended was extracted from a mouse peritoneal cavity and centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was removed, suspended with 20ml of incomplete RPMI medium [PC/SM (penicilin/streptomycin)] and again centrifuged under the same condition. In addition, the reactant was washed twice and then the cell pellet was suspended with 10 ml of incomplete RPMI 1640 medium so as to prepare a cell suspension. Then, the cell number was calculated with the hemocytometer and adjusted to reach 1 X 106 cells/ml of cell concentration in the final cell suspension. 100]il of the resulting suspension was transferred into each well of 96-well plate and left at 37°C in 5% C02 with the incubator for about 2 hours in order to attach macrophages. The attached macrophage was washed twice by using PBS buffer, treated to experimental samples in a proper concentration and then blended with 3% FBS-<br><br>
RPMI 1640 medium so as to adjust the total volume reaching 200 \xl. The resulting cell was cultivated in the incubator at 37°C in 5% C02 for about 12 ~ 16 hours. Then, arachidonic acid was added, adjusting to 10 p.M of a final concentration and incubated at 37°C for more 10 minutes and the supernatant of the reacted solution (-180 ^il) was recovered to finish the reaction. In order to quantitate the amount of PGE2 in the samples, the ELISA method recommended from Cayman Chemical company was exploited and the obtained results was used to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-1.<br>
Second, the cyclooxygenase-2 was examined through the following procedure.<br>
Peritoneal fluid suspended with macrophages was extracted from a mouse peritoneal cavity and centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was removed, suspended using incomplete RPMI medium [PC/SM (penicilin/streptomycin)] and again centrifuged under the same condition. In addition, the react ant was washed twice and then the cell pellet was suspended with 10 ml of incomplete RPMI 1640 medium so as to prepare a cell suspension. Then, the cell number was calculated with the hemocytometer and adjusted to reach IX 106 eel Is /ml of cell concentration in the final cell suspension. The resulting suspension was treated  with  aspirin,  adjusting  500  p,M  of  final<br><br>
concentration and transderred into each well of 96-well plate in 100 |il respectively. Again, it was left at 37°C in 5% C02 in the incubator for about 2 hours in order to attach macrophages. The attached macrophage was washed twice by using PBS buffer, treated to experimental samples in a proper concentration and then blended with 3% FBS-RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 Hg/ml of LPS in each well. The resulting cell was cultivated in the incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2 for about 12 ~ 16 hours. Then, arachidonic acid was added, adjusting to 10 |iM of a final concentration and incubated at 37°C for more 10 minutes and the supernatant of the reacted solution (~ 180 \xl) was recovered to finish the reaction. In order to quantitate the amount of PGE2 in the samples, the EL1SA method recommended from Cayman Chemical company was exploited and the obtained results was used to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
(2) Experimental results<br>
The experimental results were demonstrated in Table 1 as follows.<br><br><table>
<br>
Inhibitory effects of cyclooxygenase  (COX)  (unit:  % inhibition)<br><br>
In vitro experiments were observed to measure the inhibitional ratios against cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Consequently, in case of the compound of Example 7, N-(l-benzyl-lH-indole-5-yl)-methanesulfonamide, the inhibition effect against cyclooxygenase-2 was identified to be more excellent than a comparative substance and coincidently, the inhibition effect against cyclooxygenase-1 be in much lower level than a comparative substance. That is to say, the selectivity of cyclooxygenase-2 is confirmed<br><br>
to be better than any other substances, which proves the structural efficacy of IH-indole derivatives in the present invention.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As demonstrated and confirmed above, the novel compound of 1H-indole derivative is a substitute drug improved in side effects of conventional non-steroids anti-inflammatory drug and is useful for patients suffering from peptic ulcer, gastritis, partial enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhagia, hypoprothrombinemia and the like. Besides, it is expected to treat inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and the like effectively.<br>

1H-INDOLE  DERIVATIVES  AS A HIGHLY   SELECTIVE CYCLOOXYGENASE-2   INHIBITOR<br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
The     present     invention     relates     to     lH-indole derivatives    as    a    highly    selective    cyclooxygenase-2<br>
inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Most of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs represent actions such as anti-inflammation, ataralgesia, defervescence by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin G/H synthase. In addition, they can suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. First, only cyclooxygenase-1 was known to be found in cow as a constitutional enzyme. But recently, cyclooxygenase-2 is elucidated as an induced form. Cyclooxygenase-2 is identified to be discriminated clearly from cyclooxygenase-1 and can be provoked easily by mitogen, endotoxin, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the<br>
like-Pros taglandins  have  various  pathological  and physiological functions. Precisely, cvclooxvaenase-1 as<br><br>
a constitutional enzyme participates in the secretion of basic endogenous prostaglandin and plays an important role in physiological aspects such as stomach homeostasis, renal blood circulation and so on. On the other hand, cyclooxygenase-2 is induced by inflammatory factors, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the like and thus plays an important role in pathological effects of prostaglandins. Therefore, selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 are expected to have no side effect on account of the functional mechanism compared with the anti-inflammatory drugs such as conventional non-steroid agents and to represent actions such as anti-inflammation, ataralgesia and defervescence. Furthermore, it is estimated to suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. Especially, it probably has lesser side effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity and the like. Also, it is assumed to prevent the synthesis of contractive prostanoids and thus inhibit the contraction of smooth muscle induced by the prostanoid. Hence, it can be applied usefully to treat a premature birth, dysmenorrhea, asthma and several diseases associated with eosinophilic leukocytes. Besides, it can be exploited widely to cure osteoporosis, glaucoma and athymia, which has been disclosed  in a  lot  of references,  especially the<br><br>
usefulness of selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 (References: John Vane, " Towards a better aspirin " in Nature, Vol. 367, pp 215-216, 1994; Bruno Battistini, Regina Botting and Y. S. Bakhle, " COX-1 and COX-2; Toward the Development of More Selective NSAIDs " in Drug News and Perspectives, Vol. 7, pp 501-512, 1994; David B- Reitz and Karen Seibert, " Selective Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors " in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, James A. Bristol, Editor, Vol. 30, pp 179-188, 1995).<br>
The selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 have been reported to have various structural forms. Among these, the diaryl heterocycle structure, namely a tricyclic system, has been studied most frequently and exploited to construct a lot of candidate substances. In this structure, it is essential that sulfonamide or methanesulfone group exist onto one phenyl group. The initial substance of such a structure is identified to be Dup697 (Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 5, No. 18, p 2123, 1995). Then, as a derivative, SC-58635 (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 40, p 1347, 1997) having a pyrrazole structure, MK-966 (WO 95/00501) having a furanone structure and the like are disclosed.<br><br>

Concretely,  the compound of formula 1 in the present  invention  can  be  prepared  as  illustrated schematically in following reaction formula 1. <reaction formula><br><br><br>
Wherein, X, Y, and Q are defined above,<br>
L is halogen. As demonstrated in the above reaction formula 1, the compound of the present invention can be prepared through  2  pathways  from  5-nitroindole   or  5-nitroindoline  as  initial material.  Namely,  benzoyl group or benzyl group are introduced to a nitrogen atom included  in  the  parent  nucleus  first  and  then, methanesulfonyl group is inserted to an amine group on 5-location   (method  1) .     On  the  other  hand, methanesulfonyl group is adopted to an amine group on 5-location of parent nucleus first, and then benzoyl group or benzyl group are introduced later (method 2).<br>
A detailed description on preparing the compound of the present invention by the above method (1) is as follows.<br>
The reaction of 5-nitroindole or 5-nitroindoline with benzoylhalide or benzylhalide derivatives should be specifically accomplished under the presence of a base.

On the other hand, a detailed description on preparing the compound of the present invention by the above method (2) is as follows.<br>
The reduction of 5-nitroindole or 5-nitroindoline as initial material is performed under the same condition with the above method (1) which exploites palladium/ carbon as a catalyst.<br>
Then,  the  formation  of  sulfonamide  of  5-<br><br>
aminoindole  or  5-aminoincloline  prepared  thereby  is accomplished as follows: amine and mesyl chloride is reacted  under  the  presence  of  a  base  such  as triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, pyridine, imidazole, and a solvent selected among tetrahydrofuran, diethylether,      dimethoxyethane,      ethylacetate, dichloromethane, methanol, and ethanol, Preferably, it should be performed at the range of -30 "C - room temperature and more preferably, at a low temperature in between -20 - -10°C.<br>
The  resulting  sulfonamide  compound  will  be reacted with bezoylhalide or benzylhalide derivatives through the following procedure.

In order to investigate the activity of the present compound for the selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pharmacologically, the enzymatic activities inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 were measured quantitatively.<br>
First of all, the cyclooxygenase-1 was examined through the following procedure,<br>
Peritoneal fluid in which macrophages were suspended was extracted from a mouse peritoneal cavity and centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was removed, suspended with 20ml of incomplete RPMI medium [PC/SM (penicilin/streptomycin)] and again centrifuged under the same condition. In addition, the reactant was washed twice and then the cell pellet was suspended with 10 ml of incomplete RPMI 1640 medium so as to prepare a cell suspension. Then, the cell number was calculated with the hemocytometer and adjusted to reach 1 X 106 cells/ml of cell concentration in the final cell suspension. 100]il of the resulting suspension was transferred into each well of 96-well plate and left at 37°C in 5% C02 with the incubator for about 2 hours in order to attach macrophages. The attached macrophage was washed twice by using PBS buffer, treated to experimental samples in a proper concentration and then blended with 3% FBS-<br><br>
RPMI 1640 medium so as to adjust the total volume reaching 200 \xl. The resulting cell was cultivated in the incubator at 37°C in 5% C02 for about 12 ~ 16 hours. Then, arachidonic acid was added, adjusting to 10 p.M of a final concentration and incubated at 37°C for more 10 minutes and the supernatant of the reacted solution (-180 ^il) was recovered to finish the reaction. In order to quantitate the amount of PGE2 in the samples, the ELISA method recommended from Cayman Chemical company was exploited and the obtained results was used to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-1.<br>
Second, the cyclooxygenase-2 was examined through the following procedure.<br>
Peritoneal fluid suspended with macrophages was extracted from a mouse peritoneal cavity and centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was removed, suspended using incomplete RPMI medium [PC/SM (penicilin/streptomycin)] and again centrifuged under the same condition. In addition, the react ant was washed twice and then the cell pellet was suspended with 10 ml of incomplete RPMI 1640 medium so as to prepare a cell suspension. Then, the cell number was calculated with the hemocytometer and adjusted to reach IX 106 eel Is /ml of cell concentration in the final cell suspension. The resulting suspension was treated  with  aspirin,  adjusting  500  p,M  of  final<br><br>
concentration and transderred into each well of 96-well plate in 100 |il respectively. Again, it was left at 37°C in 5% C02 in the incubator for about 2 hours in order to attach macrophages. The attached macrophage was washed twice by using PBS buffer, treated to experimental samples in a proper concentration and then blended with 3% FBS-RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 Hg/ml of LPS in each well. The resulting cell was cultivated in the incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2 for about 12 ~ 16 hours. Then, arachidonic acid was added, adjusting to 10 |iM of a final concentration and incubated at 37°C for more 10 minutes and the supernatant of the reacted solution (~ 180 \xl) was recovered to finish the reaction. In order to quantitate the amount of PGE2 in the samples, the EL1SA method recommended from Cayman Chemical company was exploited and the obtained results was used to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
