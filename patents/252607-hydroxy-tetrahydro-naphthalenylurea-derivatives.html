DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to hydroxy-tetrahydro-naphmalenylurea derivatives which are useful as an active ingredient of pharmaceutical preparations. The, hydroxy-tetrahydro-naphthalenylurea derivatives of the present invention has vanilloid receptor (VR) antagonistic activity, and can be used for the prophylaxis and ' treatment of diseases associated with VR1 activity, in particular for the treatment of urge urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritic pain, neuralgia, neuropathies, algesia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration, stroke, incontinence and/or inflammatory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<br>
Urinary incontinence (UI) is the involuntary loss of urine. Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) is one of the most common types of UI together with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) which is usually caused by a defect in the urethral closure mechanism. UUI is often associated with neurological disorders or diseases causing neuronal damages such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and diabetes, although it also occurs in individuals with no such disorders. One of the usual causes of UUI is overactive bladder (OAB) which is a medical condition referring to the symptoms of frequency and urgency derived from abnormal contractions and instability of the detrusor muscle.<br>
There are several medications for urinary incontinence on the market today mainly to help treating UUI. Therapy for OAB is focused on drugs that affect peripheral neural control mechanisms or those that act directly on bladder detrusor smooth muscle contraction, with a major emphasis on development of anticholinergic agents. These<br>
agents can inhibit the parasympathetic nerves which control bladder voiding or can exert a direct spasmolytic effect on the detrusor muscle of the bladder. This results in a decrease in intravesicular pressure, an increase in capacity and a reduction in the frequency of bladder contraction. Orally active anticholinergic drugs such as propantheline (ProBanthine), tolterodine tartrate (Detrol) and oxyburynin (Ditropan) are the most commonly prescribed drugs. However, their most serious drawbacks are unacceptable side effects such as dry mouth, abnormal visions, constipation, and central nervous system disturbances. These side effects lead to poor compliance. Dry mouth symptoms alone are responsible for a 70% non-compliance rate with oxyburynin. The inadequacies of present therapies highlight the need for novel, efficacious, safe, orally available drugs that have fewer side effects.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Vanilloid compounds are characterized by the presence of a vanillyl group or a functionally equivalent group. Examples of several vanilloid compounds or vanilloid receptor modulators are vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde)', guaiacol (2-methoxy-phenol), zingerone (4-/4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl/-2-butanon), eugenol-(2-methoxy4-/2-propenyl/phenol), and capsaicin (8-methy-N-vanillyl-6-nonene-amide).<br>
Among others, capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in "hot" chili peppers, is a specific neurotoxin that desensitizes C-fiber afferent neurons. Capsaicin interacts with vanilloid receptors (VR1), which are predominantly expressed in cell bodies of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or nerve endings of afferent sensory fibers including C-fiber nerve endings [Tominaga M, Caterina MJ, Malmberg AB, Rosen TA, Gilbert H, Skinner K, Raumann BE, Basbaum AI, Julius D: The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli. Neuron. 21: 531-543, 1998]. The VR1 receptor was recently cloned [Caterina MJ, Schumacher MA, Tominaga M, Rosen TA, Levine JD, Julius D: Nature 389: 816-824, (1997)] and identified as a nonselective cation channel with six transmembrane domains that is structurally<br>
related to the TRP (transient receptor potential) channel family. Binding of capsaicin . to VR1 allows sodium, calcium and possibly potassium ions to flow down their concentration gradients, causing initial depolarization and release of neurotransmitters from the nerve terrnmals. VR1 can therefore be viewed as a molecular integrator of chemical and physical stimuh that elicit neuronal signals in a pathological conditions or diseases.<br>
There are abundant of direct or indirect evidence that shows the relation between VR1 activity and diseases such as pain, ischaemia, and inflammatory (e.g., WO 99/00115 and 00/50387). Further, it has been demonstrated that VR1 transduce reflex signals that are involved in the overactive bladder of patients who have damaged or abnormal spinal reflex pathways [De Groat WC: A neurologic basis for the overactive bladder. Urology 50 (6A Suppl): 36-52, 1997]. Desensitisation of the. afferent nerves by depleting neurotransmitters using VR1 agonists such as capsaicin has been shown to give promising results in the treatment of bladder dysfunction associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis [(Maggi CA: Therapeutic potential of capsaicin-like molecules - Studies in animals and humans. Life Sciences 51: 1777-1781, 1992) and (DeRidder D; Chandirafnani V;.Dasgupta P; VanPoppel H; Baert L; Fowler CJ: Intravesical capsaicin as a treatment for refractory detrusor hyperreflexia: A dual center study with long-term followup. J. Urol. 158: 2087-2092, 1997)].<br>
It is anticipated that antagonism of the VR1 receptor would lead to the blockage of neurotransmitter release, resulting in prophylaxis and treatment of the condition and diseases associated with VR1 activity.<br>
It is therefore expected that antagonists of the VR1 receptor can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of the condition and diseases including chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritic pain, neuralgia, neuropathies, algesia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration,  stroke,  incontinence,<br>

At least three reproducible micturition cycles, corresponding to a 20-minute period, were recorded before a test compound administration and used as baseline values.<br>
(4)	Administration of test compounds and stimulation of bladder with capsaicin<br>
The saline infusion was stopped before adnoinistrating compounds. A testing compound dissolved in the mixture of ethanol, Tween 80 (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) and saline (1:1:8, v/v/v) was administered intraarterially at 10 mg/kg.. 2min after the adrninistration of the compound 10 jag of capsaicin (Nacalai Tesque) dissolved in ethanol was administered intraarterially.<br>
(5)      Analysis of cystometry parameters<br>
Relative increases in the capsaicin-induced intravesical pressure were analyzed from the cystometry data. The capsaicin-induced bladder pressures were compared with the maximum bladder pressure during micturition without the capsaicin stimulation. The testing compounds-mediated inhibition of the increased bladder pressures was evaluated using Student's t-test. A probability level less than 5% was accepted as significant difference.<br>
[Measurement of over active bladder in anesthetized cystitis rats] (Assay 5)<br>
(1)	Animals<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (180-250 g / Charles River Japan) were used. Cyclophosphamide (CYP) dissolved in saline was administered iritra-peritoneally at 150 mg/kg 48 hours before experiment.<br>
(2)	Catheter implantation<br>
Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of urethane (Sigma) at 1.25 g/kg. The abdomen was opened through a midline incision,. and a polyethylene catheter (BECTON DICKINSON, PE50) was implanted into the bladder through the dome". In parallel, the inguinal region was incised, and a polyethylene catheter (BECTON DICKINSON, PE50) filled with saline (Otsuka) was inserted into a femoral vein. After the bladder was emptied, the rats were left for 1 hour for recovery from the operation.<br>
(3)	Cystometric investigation<br>
The bladder catheter was connected via T-tube to a pressure transducer (Viggo-Spectranied   Pte   Ltd,   DT-XXAD)   and   a   microinjection   pump<br>
(TERUMO). Saline was infiised at room temperature into the bladder at a rate . of 3.6 ml/hr for 20 rain. Intravesical pressure was recorded continuously on a chart pen recorder (Yokogawa). At least three reproducible micturition cycles, corresponding to a 20-rninute period, were recorded before a test compound administration.<br>
(4)	     Administration of test compounds<br>
A testing compound dissolved in the mixture of ethanol, Tween 80 (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) and saline (1:1: 8, v/v/v) was administered-intravenously at 0.05 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg. 3min after the administration of the compound, saline (Nacalai Tesque) was infused at room temperature into the bladder at a rate of 3.6 ml/hr.<br>
(5)	Analysis of cystometry parameters<br>
The cystometry parameters were analyzed as described previously [ Lecci A et al: Eur. J. Pharmacol. 259: 129-135, 1994]. The micturition frequency calculated from micturition interval and the bladder capacity calculated from a volume of infused saline until the first micturition were analyzed from the cystometry data. The testing compounds-mediated inhibition of the frequency and the testing compounds—mediated increase of bladder capacity were evaluated using unpaired Student's t-test. A probability levels less than 5% was accepted as significant difference. Data were. analyzed as the mean + SEM from 4-7 rats.<br>
[Measurement of Acute Pain]<br>
Acute pain is measured on a hot plate mainly in rats. Two variants of hot plate testing are used: In the classical variant animals are put on a hot surface (52 to 56°C) and the latency time is measured until the animals show nociceptive<br>
behavior, such as stepping or foot licking. The other variant is an increasing temperature hot plate where the experimental animals are put on a surface of neutral temperature. Subsequently this surface is slowly but constantly heated until the animals begin to lick a hind paw. The temperature which is reached when hind paw licking begins is a measure for pain threshold.<br>
Compounds are tested against a vehicle treated control group. Substance application is performed at different time points via different application routes (i.v., i.p., p.o., i.t., i.c.v., s.c, intradermal, transdermal) prior to pain testing.<br>
[Measurement of Persistent Pain]<br>
Persistent pain is measured with the formalin or capsaicin test, mainly in rats. A solution of 1 to 5%. formalin or 10 to 100 ug capsaicin is injected into one hind paw of the experimental animal. After formalin or capsaicin application the animals show nociceptive reactions like flinching, licking and biting of the affected paw. The number of nociceptive reactions within a time frame of up to 90 minutes is a measure for intensity of pain.<br>
Compounds are tested against a vehicle treated control group. Substance application is performed at different time points via different application routes (i.v., i.p., p.o., i.t, i.c.v., s.c, intradermal, transdermal) prior to formalin or capsaicin administration.<br>
[Measurement of Neuropathic Pain]<br>
Neuropathic pain is induced by different variants of unilateral sciatic nerve injury mainly in rats. The operation is performed under anesthesia. The first variant of sciatic nerve injury is produced by placing loosely constrictive ligatures around the common sciatic nerve (Bennett and Xie, Pain 33 (1988):<br>
87-107). The second variant is the tight ligation of about the half of the diameter of the common sciatic nerve (Seltzer et al., Pain 43 (1990): 205-218). In the next variant, a group of models is used in which tight ligations or transections are made of either the L5 and L6 spinal nerves, or the L5 spinal nerve only (KIM SH; CHUNG IM, AN EXPERIMENTAL-MODEL FOR PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PRODUCED BY SEGMENTAL SPINAL NERVE LIGATION IN THE RA, PAIN 50 (3) (1992): 355-363). The fourth variant.involves an axotomy of two of the three terminal branches of the sciatic nerve (tibial and common peroneal nerves) leaving the remaining sural nerve intact whereas the last variant comprises the axotomy of only the tibial branch leaving the sural and common nerves uninjured. Control animals are treated with a sham operation.<br>
Postoperatively, the nerve injured animals develop a chronic mechanical . allodynia, cold allodynioa, as well as a thermal hyperalgesia. Mechanical allodynia is measured by means of a pressure transducer (electronic von Frey Anesthesiometer, ETC Inc.-Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, SA, USA; Electronic von Frey System, Somedic Sales AB, Horby, Sweden). Thermal hyperalgesia is measured by means of a radiant heat source (Plantar Test, Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy), or by means of a cold plate of 5 to 10 °C where the nocifensive reactions of the affected hind paw are counted as a measure of pain intensity. A further test for cold induced pain is the counting of nocifensive reactions, or duration of nocifensive responses after plantar administration of acetone to the affected hind limb. Chronic pain in general is assessed by registering the circadanian rhytms in activity (Surjo and Amdt, Universitat zu Koln, Cologne, Germany), and by scoring differences in gait (foot print patterns; FOOTPRINTS program, Klapdor et al., 1997- A low cost method to analyse footprint patterns. J. Neurosci. Methods 75, 49-54).<br>
Compounds are tested against sham operated and vehicle treated control groups.  Substance  application is performed at different time points via<br>
different application routes (i.v., i.p., p.o., i.t., i.c.v., s.c, intradermal, transdermal) prior to pain testing.<br>
[Measurement of Inflammatory Pain]<br>
Inflammatory pain is induced mainly in rats by injection of 0.75 mg . cafrageenan or complete Freund's. adjuvant into one hind paw. The animals develop an edema with mechanical allodynia as well as thermal hyperalgesia. Mechanical allodynia is measured by means of a pressure transducer (electronic von Frey Anesthesiometer, IITC Inc.-Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, SA, USA). Thermal hyperalgesia is measured by means of a radiant heat source (Plantar Test, Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy, Paw thermal stimulator, G. . Ozaki, University of California, USA). For edema measurement two methods are being used. In the first method, the animals are sacrificed and the affected hindpaws sectioned and weighed. The second method comprises differences in paw volume by measuring water displacement in a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy).<br>
Compounds are tested against uninflamed as well as vehicle treated control groups. Substance application is performed at different time points via different application routes (i.v., i.p., p.o., i.t., i.c.v., s.c, intradermal, transdermal) prior to pain testing.<br>
[Measurement of Diabetic Neuropathic Pain]<br>
Rats treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 to 80 mg/kg streptozotocin develop a profound hyperglycemia and mechanical allodynia within 1 to 3 weeks. Mechanical allodynia is measured by means of a pressure transducer (electronic von Frey Anesthesiometer, IITC Inc.-Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, SA, USA).<br>
Compounds are tested against diabetic and non-diabetic vehicle treated . control groups. Substance application is performed at different time points via different application routes  (i.v.,  i.p.,  p.o.,  i.t.,  i.c.v.,   s.c,  intradermal, transdermal) prior to pain testing.<br>
