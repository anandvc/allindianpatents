BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a robust control for a three-position actuator piston assembly of the type utilized to control the double-acting clutches of a change-gear transmission, such as the splitter clutches or range clutches of a compound transmission. In particular, the present Invention relates to a robust control for a pressurized, fluid-actuated actuator piston assembly providing three selectable, maintainable positions (axialry centered, axially displaced in B first direction, and axially displaced in a second direction) and requiring only a single controllable, variable pressure fluid supply device Including 8 pulse-width-modulated, solenoid-controlled valve<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Change-gear mechanical transmissions having double-acting clutch mechanisms, of both the synchronized and non-synchronized types, are well known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to US Pats. No 3,105,395; 3.335.616; 4,428.469; 4.754,665, 4.9.2.0,8.15.. 4,944,197, 5,086,897; 5.370,013 and 5,390,561, the disclosures of which are Incorporated herein by reference Two-position and three-position, fluid-actuated, actuator piston assemblies and actuator systems associated therewith also are well known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats No 4,899,607; 4,928,544; 4,936,156; 5,054,591; 5.193.410; 5,263,379; 5.272,441 and 5,329,826, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
A transmission utilizing a three-position splitter actuator and a splitter cluich having Increased backlash is disclosed in U.S. Pat No 5,651,292, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference<br><br>
2<br>
A fluid pressure-operated, three-position shift actuator requiring only a single   controlled   source   of  pressurized  fluid   is   disclosed   in   US    Pat No. 5,661,998, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,998, the three-position piston is used to achieve a mid-position or neutral state in which neither of the splitter gears is engaged. This neutral state allows the gear set that is being shifted to, to achieve a synchronized speed with the engaging member (the sliding clutch) and, as such, provides a much smoother shift.<br>
This mid or neutral posrtion is obtained by applying a constant air pressure signal to the smaller piston face side of the splitter cylinder and a lower pressure to the larger piston face side. This lower pressure is achieved by pulse width modulating (PWM'Ing) a solenoid valve that applies air pressure to the aft side of the piston. This PWM'ing entails rapidly turning a three-way, two-position, solenoid-controlled valve on and then off to achieve a pressure somewhere between zero psl and the full system pressure.<br>
Testing of the prior art system has shown that the range of PWM values resulting in this neutral state is so small that it makes utilizing this method of control difficult for vehicular transmission applications Operating variables such as temperature, voltage, pressure, contamination and manufacturing variations for both the solenoid valve and the splitter piston all play together to affect the range of PWM values that yield neutral.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the drawbacks of the prior art are minimized or overcome by the provision of a robust control for a relatively simple and inexpensive fluid-actuated three-position shift actuator piston assembly and actuator system which requires only a single controllable source of selectably variably pressurized fluid.<br>
The foregoing is accomplished by modifying the prior art controls in at least one of the following manners:<br><br>
3<br>
(1)	The voltage applied to the solenoid valve directly affects the<br>
valve response time and, as such, the PWM values that result in a neutral<br>
slate.  This valve response time can vary by more than a factor of 2 over the range of 9 to 18 VDC ihai the system must operate under   The robust control of the present invention, therefore, senses system voltage with the ECU and adjusts the valve PWM value so that the spliter  will achieve a neutral state.<br>
(2)	The response time of the valve turning off is directly affected by<br>
the maximum current in the coil.   The robust control of the present invention,<br>
therefore, employs a circuit in the ECU that rolls back the current In the coil of<br>
the solenoid valve to a lower and constant value, regardless of the voltage at<br>
the coil.  By starting from the same poinl every time, the valve off times are<br>
very constant and, as such, the effects of coil current levels are greatly<br>
reduced.<br>
(3)	A spring-loaded plunger that fits into a notch in the splitter rod (or<br>
piston) is used to hold the splitter piston in neutral.   This spring-loaded plunger<br>
or detent increases the range of PWM values that keeps the splitter in the<br>
neutral state by requiring additional force to move out of this state.  The detent<br>
is designed such that it gives added force to hold the piston in neutral during<br>
PWM conditions but not so much force that it slows the response time for the<br>
cylinder as it moves from neutral into gear.<br>
(4)	The larger the flow orifice in the valve, the smaller the PWM<br>
range that will result in the neutral state for the splitter piston.   This is because<br>
larger orifices flow so much air that the valve can only be open for a very short<br>
time before the pressure in the cylinder rises to a point that the splitter moves<br>
through neutral.  Since the same valve that is used for the splitter piston also<br>
may be used for the range piston (one that requires high flow), the robust<br>
control of the present invention Initially had a very small PWM lange for neutral.<br>
An orifice was added between the splitter solenoid valve and the splitter piston to improve this situation. This significantly increased the PWM range to achieve neutral and allowed common valves to be used for the splitter and the range pistons.<br><br>
4<br>
By utilzing one or more of the features described above, an open loop control, more robust to the various system variations, is provided<br>
This and other objects and advantages of the present Invention will become apparent from a reading of the following description of the preferred embodiment taken in connection with the attached drawings.<br>

cause the clutch members and all members rotating therewith to rotate at a substantially synchronous speed<br>
The fluid-actuated, three-position shift actuator system 10 of the present Invention, and the three-position actuator piston assembly 12 utilized therein, may be especially advantageously utilized as a splitter clutch actuator in a compound transmission 110, as illustrated in Figs 2-4<br>
Transmission 110 includes a mainsection 112 and an auxiliary section 114, both contained within housing 116 Housing 116 includes a forward end wall 116A and a rearward end wall 116B, but not an intermediate wall.<br>
Input shaft 118 carries input gear 120 fixed for rotation therewith and defines a rearwardly opening pocket 118A wherein a reduced diameter extension 158A of output shaft 158 is piloted.   A non-friction bushing 118B or<br><br>
6<br>
the tike may be provided in pocket or blind bore 118A. The forward end of input shaft 118 is supported by bearing 118C in front end wall 116A while thee rearward end 158C of output shaft 158 is supported by beating assembly 158D in rear and wall 116B Bearing assembly 158D may be a pair of opposed taper bearings or a single roller or ball bearing as is illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
The mains haft 146, which carries mainshafl clutches 148 and 150, and the mains haft splitter clutch 180 is In the form of a generally tubular body I46A having an externally spllned outer surface 146B and an axially extending through bore 146C for passage of output shaft 158 Shift forks 152 and 154 are provided for shifting clutches 148 and 150. respectively. Mainshaft 146 is Independently rotatable relative to Input shaft 118 and output shaft 158 and. preferably, is free for limited radial movements relative thereto<br>
The mainsection 112 includes two substantially Identical mainsection countershaft assemblies 122, each comprising a mainsection countershaft 124 carrying countershaft gears 130, 132, 134, 136 and 138 fixed thereto Gear pairs 130, 134, 136 and 138 are constantly meshed with Input gear 118. mainshafl gears 140 and 142 and Idler 157, which is meshed with reverse mainshaft gear 144, respectively<br>
Mainsection countershaft 124 extends rearwardly into the auxiliary section, where its rearward end 124A is supported directly or indirectly in rear housing end wall 116B.<br>
The auxiliary section 114 includes two substantially identical auxiliary countershaft  assemblies 160,  each  including   an   auxiliary   countershaft 162 carrying auxiliary countershaft gears 168, 170 and 172 for rotation therewith. Auxiliary countershaft gear pairs 168, 170 and 172 are constantly meshed with splitter gear 174, splitter/range gear 176 and range gear 178, respectively Splitter clutch 180 is fixed to mainshafl 146 for selectively clutching either gear 174 or 176 thereto, while synchronized range clutch 182 is fixed to output shaft 158  for  selectively  clutching   either   gear 176   or   gear 178   thereto<br><br>
7<br>
Preferably,  the   splitter   clutch  is   axially   positioned   by   a   shift   fork 180A controlled by the actuator system 10 of the present Invention<br>
Auxiliary countershafts 162 are generally tubular in shape defining a through bore 162A for receipt of the rearward extensions of the malnsectlon countershafts 124 Bearings or bushings 162B and 162C are provided to rotatably support auxiliary countershaft 162 on mainsection countershaft 124 Bearing 1620 directly or indireclly supports the rear ends of countershafts 124 and 162 in the rear end wall 116B<br>
The structure and function of double-acting jaw clutch collar 180 is substantially Identical to the structure and function of the sliding clutch collars 148 and 150 utilized in the main transmission section 112 and the function of double-acting synchronized clutch assembly 182 is substantially identical to the structure and function of prior art double-acting synchronized clutch assemblies, examples of which may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats No 4.462.489; 4.125.179 and 2,667.955, the disclosures of which are Incorporated herein by reference The synchronized clutch assembly 182 Illustrated   is   of   the   pin   type   described   in   aforementioned   U.S.   Pat.<br>
No 4,462,489.<br>
When used in connection with the actuator system 10 of the present invention, tne splitter jaw clutch 180 is a three position clutch assembly which may be selectively positioned in the rightwardmost (direct) or leftwardmost (overdrive) positions for engaging either gear 176 or gear 174, respectively, to the mainshaft 146 or in an intermediate non-engaged (neutral) position. The neutral position refers to the range of intermediate positions of clutch 180 wherein neither gear 1 74 nor 176 is engaged to the mainshaft 146<br>
As may be seen by reference to Figs 2-4, by selectively axially positioning both the splitter clutch 180 and the range clutch 182 in the forward and rearward axial positions thereof, four distinct ratios of mainshaft rotation to output shaft rotation may be provided. Accordingly, auxiliary transmission section 114 is a three-layer auxiliary section of the combined range and splitter type providing four selectable  speeds  or   drive  ratios  between the  input<br><br>
8<br>
(mainshaft 146) and output (output shaft 158) thereof The mainsection 112 provides a reverse and three potentially selectable forward speeds However, one of the selectable mainsection forward gear ratios, the low speed gear ratios associated with mainshafi gear 142, is not utilized in the high range Thus, transmission 110 is property designated as a "(2+1) x (2x2)" type transmission providing nine or ten selectable forward speeds, depending upon the desirability and practicality of splitting the low gear ratio<br>
The shift pattern for shifting transmission 110 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. Divisions in the vertical direction at each gear lever position signify splitter shifts, while movement In the horizontal direction from the 3/4 and 5/6 leg of the H pattern to the 7/8 and 9/10 leg of the H pattern signifies a shift from the low range to the high range of the transmission As discussed above, splitter shifting is accomplished in the usual manner by means of a vehicle operator-actuated splitter button or the like, usually a button located at the shift lever knob, while operation of the range clutch shifting assembly is an automatic response to movement of the gear shift lever between the central and rightwardmost legs of the shift pattern, as illustrated in Fig. 6 Range shift devices of this general type are known In the prior art and may be seen hy reference to US Pate. No. 3.429,202; 4.45.6,883. 4,561,325 4.663.72b and 4.974.468. Ihe disclosures of which are Incorporated herein by reference<br>
Refarring again to Fig.4 and assumming that it is desirable that a <br>
transmission have generally equal ratio steps, the mainsection ratio steps should be generally equal, the splitter step should be generally equal to the square root of the mainsection ratio steps, and the range step should equal about the mainsection ratio step raised to the Nth power, where N equals the number of mainsection ratio steps occurring in both ranges (i e , N = 2 In the (2+1) x (2x2) transmission 110). Given the desired Ideal ratios, gearing to approximate these ratios is selected in the above example, the splitter steps are about 33 3%, white the range step is about 316%, which generally is suitable for a "2+1" main transmission section having about 78% steps, as the<br><br>
9<br>
square root of 1.78 equals about 1.33, and 1.78 raised to the second power (i.e.. N = 2) equals about 3 16<br>
For certain at feast partially automated mechanical transmission systems utilizing mechanical transmissions simitar to transmission 110 illustrated in Figs. 2-4, it may be desirable under certain operating conditions to cause the splitter jaw cluSch 180 to move to and remain in the neutral position thereof and/or to vary the force applied to the shift fork 180A and clutch 180. The shift actuator piston assembly 12 and actuator system-10 of the present invention provides a relatrvely simple, inexpensive and reliable means to provide these desirable splitter clutch control features<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the fluid-actuated, three-position actuator piston assembly 12 includes a two-plece cylinder body 14, including a main body piece 14A and an end cap 14B. The cylinder body defines a blind bore 16 from which extends a piston shaft 18 carrying a shift actuator such as the shift fork 180A for axial movement therewith. The blind bore 16 includes an enlarged interior diameter portion 16A, a reduced interior diameter portion 16B, and an intermediate interior diameter portion 16C interposed between the large and small interior diameter portions Shoulders 16D and 16E, respectively, are defined at the intersections of bote portions 16A and 16C and of bore portions 16C and 16B, respectively. By way of example, for a heavy-duty transmission, the interior diameters 16F, 16G and 16H of bore portions 16A, 16B and 16C, respectively, may be about 2.203 inches, 1.197 inches and 1.850 inches, respectively.<br>
An enlarged differential area piston member 20 is slidably and sealingly received in enlarged bore portion 16A and is fixed to shaft 1B for axial movement therewith Piston 20 defines a leftward facing large race 20A and a fightward-facing smaller face 20B.<br>
Shaft 18 is slidably received in smaller diameter bore portion 16B and carries an annular, tubular piston member 22 on the outer diameter surface 18A thereof. Annular, tubular piston member 22 defines an interior diameter surface 22A  slidabry  and   sealingly  carried   by  the   outer  diameter<br><br>
10<br>
surface 18A of shaft 18 and an outer diameter surface 22B slidably and seafingly received in intermediate diameter portion 16C The tubular piston also defines a leftward-facing piston face 22C.<br>
Although shaft 18 is illustrated in connection with shift yoke 180A, it also may be utilized to operate other devices such as shift mechanisms of the types illustrated in U.S Pat. No. 4,920,815.<br>
Rightward axial movement of the annular, tubular piston 22 relative to shaft 18 is limited by stop member 24, while leftward axial movement of the piston 22 relative to shaft 18 is limited by piston face 208. Rightward axial movement of tubular piston 22 relative to bore 16 and body 14 is limited by shoulder 16E. Piston face 20A and bore portion 16A define a first chamber 26 connected by passage 28 to a selectably pressurized and exhausted fluid conduit A, while piston face 20B, bore piston 16A and the leftward face 22C of tubular secondary piston 22 define a second chamber 30 connected by passage 32 to a constantly pressurized conduit B.<br>
A position sensor 34 may be provided to provide an input signal indicative of the axial position of shaft 18 and/or shift yoke 180A. As is Illustrated, shift yoke 180A may be fully leftwardly displaced to engage the overdrive splitter ratio (i.e., gear 174 engaged to mainshaft 46), fully rightwardly displaced to engage the direct drive splitter ratio (i.e.. gear 176 engaged to mainshaft 146), or centered in a neutral position area (mainshaft 146 not engaged to either gears 174 or 176).<br>
A microprocessor-based controller 36 may be provided to receive various input signals 38 which are processed according to predetermined logic rules to issue command output signals 40 to various system actuators, such as the pulse-width-modulated, solenoid-controlled valve assembly 42 used to control the pressurization and exhaust of conduit. A and piston chamber 26. Controllers of this type are known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats. No. 4,360,060; 4,595,986; 5,281,902 and 5,445,126, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A source of onboard filtered and  regulated air 44, usually from the<br><br><br>
11<br>
vehicle compressor, is constantly connected directly to chamber 30 through conduit B and passage 32 in body 14 The chamber 26 is selectably connected by conduit A and passage 38 to (he source 44 or to atmosphere (ATMO), depending upon the position of the three-way, two-position pulse-width-modulated, solenoid-controlled valve assembly 42. In a typical heavy- duty vehicle, the source of pressurized air 44 will be regulated at about 80 psl<br>
The microprocessor-based controller 36 may receive input signals from an electronic data link, such as those conforming to industry-established protocols such as SAE J1922, SAE J1939 and/or ISO 11898 and/or from various sensors such as sensors indicative of throttle pedal position, vehicle speed, transmission shaft speed, engine speed, engine torque, shift lever and/or splitter selector manipulation, master clutch condition and the like The controller 36 also may issue command output signals 40 to display devices, transmission main section and/or range section actuators, engine controllers, master clutch operators, driveline retarder operators and the like The controller 36 also may issue command output signals to pulse-width-modulated, solenoid-controlled valve assembly 42.<br>
A sensor 158E may be provided to provide a signal indicative of the rotational speed of output shaft 158 (also indicative of vehicle speed), and a sensor 60 may be provided to provide a signal Indicative of operation of the splitter selector switch 62 located on the shift lever 64<br>
It is important lo note that when piston shaft 18/shift yoke 180A is in the neutral position and tubular piston 22 is on stop 24 (which is the natural consequence of constantly pressurizing chamber 30). then tubular piston 22 will be in contact with shoulder 16E. Accordingly, if the shaft 18/yoke 180A is displaced in the overdrive (leftward) direction, the face 22C of piston 22 will apply a rightward force on the shaft and yoke (about 130 pounds in the current example), which force will abruptly cease as the shaft 18/yoke 180A moves to neutral or to the direct drive (rightward) direction from neutral. This behavior is utilized to control positioning of the three-position actuator 12, as will be described in greater detail below.<br><br>

Fig. 5 is a graphic representation of the forces applied to the shift yoke 180A at various degrees of pulse width modulation, depending on the positioning of the yoke, and assuming the dimensions set forth above, and an 80-psi source of pressurized fluid (ie. 20A = 2.203 inches; 20B - 1.197 inches; 20C = 1850 inches; and source 44 = 80 psi) In Fig. 5, the percentage of pulse width modulation (% PWM) varies from 0% modulation (fully energized) to 100% modulation (energized none of the time), and positive force is in the direct (rightward) direction, while negative' force is in the overdrive (leftward) direction. Line 50 represents the forces applied to the yoke if the yoke is displaced to the overdrive (rightward) direction of neutral, while line 52 represents the forces applied to the yoke if the yoke is displaced to the direct (leftward) direction of neutral At any given level of pulse width modulation of solenoid-controlled valve 42, or in the corresponding resulting pressurization of conduit A, the difference between lines 50 and 52 is the approximately 130 pounds of force to the right which the tubular piston will provide if the yoke 180A is located to the left (overdrive) side of neutral<br>
By way of example, if engaged in overdrive, if a 0% modulation {i.e., full energization) of solenoid-controlled valve 42 is commanded, the yoke will be biased from the overdrive position toward neutral with about 220 pounds of force until reaching neutral (line 50) and then will be biased with about 90 pounds of force from neulral to the direct position (line 52). Similarly, at 20% modulation (i.e.. valve energized 80% of time), the yoke will be urged toward neutral with about 170 pounds of force and then from neutral into direct with about 40 pounds of force<br>
As represented by line 54, at about 38% modulation (i.e., valve solenoid energized 62% of time), regardless of the position of the yoke, fhe yoke wilt be biased toward neutral with about 65 pounds of force and then abruptly stopped in the neutral position Theoretically, at about 28% modulation (line 56) to about 52% modulation (line 58), the yoke will be biased to neutral with various amounts of force and will remain in or near the neutral position<br>
Accordingly, using the three-position actuator system 10 of the present<br><br>
-13-<br>
invention, requiring only a single pulse-width-modulation-controlled, solenoid-controlled valve assembly 42, an actuator having three selectable and maintainable positions and selectably variable actuation forces is provided<br>
In the illustrated system, a modulation of 0% to about 28% will result in the actuator shifting to the direct position, a modulation of about 28% to 52% will result in the actuator shifting to neutral, and a modulation of about 52% to 100% will result in the actuator shifting to the overdrive position Alternatively, the same results may be obtained by simply providing a variable source of pressure to condull A by a source selectably variable between. 0 psi and 80 psi. The operating characteristics of system 10 may be varied, as required, by varying the relative effective areas of the piston faces 20A. 20B and 22C.<br>
The valve assembly 42 includes a solenoid 38A for controlling She positioning of two-position valve member 38B A solenoid controller 38C, operated by command signals 40 from ECU 36 is provided to selectively energize and deenergize the coils of the solenoid 42A from an onboard source (not shown) of electrical power, such as a battery or alternator All or parl of controller 42C may be integral with ECU 32/ The valve may be of the structure illustrated in aforementioned U S  Pat No  5.661.998<br>
The voltage V applied to the solenoid valve 42 directly alter the valve response time and, as such, the PWM values that result in a neutral state This valve response time can vary by more than a factor of 2 over the range of 9 to 18 VDC that a typical onboard system must operate under System voltage V is sensed by controller 42C and provided to the ECU 36 to adjust the valve PWM value so that the splitter will achieve a neutral slate. The control of solenoid 42A, thus, is done as a variable function of sensed voltage V applied to the solenoid in particular, response times (and, thus, required lead times) are considered lo vary inversely wilh sensed voltage.<br>
The response time of the vatve turning off is directly affected by the maximum current in the coil. A circuit 46 is employed in the ECU and/or controller 42C that rolls back the current in the coil of the solenoid vatve to a lower and constant value, regardless of the voltage at the coil.   By starting<br><br>
14<br>
from the same point every time, valve off times are very constant and, as such, the variable effects of coil current levels are greatly reduced<br>
A spring-loaded plunger 48 that fits into a notch 50 in the splitter rod 18 or piston is used to hold the splitter piston 20 in neutral This spring-loaded plunger or detent increases the range of PWM vatues that keep the splitter in the neutral state by requiring additional force to move out of this state. The detent is designed such that it gives added force to hold the piston in neutral during PWM conditions but not so much force that it slows the response time for the cylinder as It moves from neutrat into gear.<br>
The larger the flow orifice in the valve and/or conduits, the smaller the PWM range that will result in the neutral stale for the splitter piston This is because larger orifices flow so much air that the valve can only be open for a very short time; before the pressure in the cylinder rises to a point that the splitter moves through neutral.<br>
Since the same vatve 42B used for the splitter piston also may be used for the range piston (one that requires high flow, if required), an orifice or restriction 52 Was added between the splitter solenoid valve 42B and Ihe splitter piston chamber 26 to improve this situation This significantly increases the PWM range to achieve neutral and allows common valves to be used for the splitter and the range pistons<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, various changes to form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.<br><br>
