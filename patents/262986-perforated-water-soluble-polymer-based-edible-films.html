				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>[0132]A novel edible polymer based film dosage form manufactured using natural, synthetic, semisynthetic, pharmaceutically acceptable polymers addressing the issues of swallowing difficulties (Dysphagia and Dynaphagia), of tablet or capsule dosage forms and handling and storage difficulties associated with liquid dosage forms, that also includes materials such as emulsifying agents, suspending agents, buffering agents, effervescence agents, colorants, flavorings, sweeteners and specified amounts of bioactive agents preferably having perforations in the body of the dosage form enabling it to disperse/dissolve rapidly upon application by the subject. A flexible film dosage form to accommodate higher drug loads without compromising the fast dispersing/dissolving characteristics is presented. The perforated film system is enabled to be used in various applications such as oral, mucosal and external environments. The perforated film dosage form therefore, additionally allows the usage of polymers that would otherwise have not been used due to insolubility or limited solubility in water.</td>

				<td>Perforated water soluble polymer based edible films<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Claim of Provisional Application Rights <br>
[0001]This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/965,043 and 60/965,023 filed on 08/17/07.<br>
Technical field of invention:<br>
[0002]The present invention related to drug delivery systems and more specifically it is related to administration of bioactive agents via perforated orally fast dispersing/dissolving polymer based films in the biological system.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
[0003]Some patients experience difficulty in swallowing tablets and capsules, leading to problems in administration of dosage forms. This physiological condition is known as "Dysphagia", difficulty in swallowing or "Dynophagia", painful swallowing. Such conditions are often experienced by older patients, patients with head/neck injuries or AIDS patients. It is also a common experience with pediatric patients who tend to be non compliant with the administration of solid oral dosage forms. To address the issue of delivery of drugs to such patients liquid dosage forms have been developed. However, handling and delivering the liquid systems is always a challenge. Therefore, Ho«53ne forms with the convenience of liquids and the dose precision of solid oral dosage form is desirable. Additionally, dosage forms that do not require consumption of liquids for administration exclusively are desirable for drug administration to dialysis patients who have the restriction on fluids consumption.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
This feature in dosage forms makes dose administration convenient even for patients on the go improving overall patient compliance visit treatment regimens.<br>
In addition, the conventional oral dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, caplets, and capsules, are designed for short residence time in the mouth. Absorption of the active agent from these dosage forms occurs in the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract only after the dosage form undergoes disintegration followed by dissolution of the agent in the gastric fluids. However, for some active agents, it is desirable to achieve absorption through the highly vascularized oral mucosal tissues in order to avoid first-pass metabolism by the liver.<br>
[0004]Many active agents are poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, even after they are dispersed in the stomach, because of low solubility or slow dissolution rate in the gastric fluids. Tablets may be formulated to be quick dissolving which are commonly placed on the tongue and disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity. Consequently, they do not overcome a risk associated with choking or gagging that occurs with subjects having limited control of their swallowing reflexes. However, once placed in the mouth, these tablets dissolve rapidly in the saliva to provide a liquid formulation which is then swallowed. However, the disintegration/dispersion time for such tablet dosage forms may take sometimes as long as few minutes. The quick dispersing/dissolving tablets may be formed from a particulate support matrix containing the therapeutic agent, where the particulate support matrix is a protein (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,576, 5,635,210, 5,595,761). Alternatively, the tablet maybe formed from a laminate with several layers and an outer coating (JP 100535518). Tablets have also been manufactured from   subjected to heat and shear (WO 95/07194; WO 95/35293). Other methods of forming quick dissolving tablets include wet granulation methods (EP 0627 218) and dry granulation methods (EP 0124027A1) and by freeze-drying techniques (EP 0084705A2). Generally, quick dissolving tablets are formed using complex multi-step manufacturing processes.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
In addition, tiles tablets may have poor mechanical strength, are fragile and friable and have insufficient holding capacity for active ingredients (U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,974) and may be difficult to store and handle.<br>
[0005]Many times therapeutic agents are provided as powders or granules and may be difficult to swallow and cause unpleasant sensations in the mouth. Furthermore, many quick dissolving tablets contain particulates (&gt;25 microns) which leave a "gritty" and unpleasant taste in the mouth. In the older patients, powders may cause choking and discomfort associated with trapping of granules in dentures. Powders and granules are generally packaged in a sealed pouch which requires unsealing before use. This causes problems for geriatric patients and those suffering from arthritis in the fingers, as well as for children. Consequently, problems such as spillage of package contents are common in this group of patients. Furthermore, these oral preparations should be taken with water which for certain patients may be inconvenient and may lead to reduced patient compliance.<br>
[0006]Few of the alternatives to solid oral dosage forms addressing aforementioned disadvantages are liquids, syrups, emulsions or suspensions and are considered desirable for pediatric and geriatric patients who have problems in swallowing tablets. However, these dosage forms are often difficult to measure accurately and administer easily without the loss of dose due to spillage. Additionally, liquid formulations deteriorate rapidly upon exposure to heat or atmosphere and consequently have a relatively short shelf life while emulsion/suspension dosage forms may eventually settle and form cakes leading to the loss of dose uniformity. Furthermore, liquid formulations require a<br>
[0007]ln addition to solid and liquid dosage forms, rapidly dissolving buccal/oral delivery systems have been developed using methods including freeze drying. However, the freeze dried preparations are more expensive to manufacture as<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
compared to tablets (U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,093). Furthermore, freeze dried preparations are brittle and fragile when handled and must be kept in dry conditions to avoid disintegration. The instability of freeze-dried preparations has been reduced somewhat by the addition of mannitol (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,684). WO 9820862 reports a film that is formed according to a method that does not utilize freeze drying and avoids problems described in the art such as rigidity of the films, delayed softening and poor solubility in the mouth (U.S. Pat. No. 4,876,092; EP 0200508; EPO 381194; CA-PS 1-26331; DE 2449865.5; DE 3630603; EP 0452446 and EP 0219762). However, the film described in WO 9820862 relies on the use of at least two different non-ionic surfactants to achieve immediate wettability. In yet another patent# 4136145 issued to Fuchs, a novel film dosage form was disclosed made from water soluble polymers and claimed to be useful for oral, topical or external application. However, this patent failed to address the issues of drug loading and fast dispersion of the films. In the issued patent 4029758 to MIodozeniec and Goldberg discloses a method of preparing edible web for film having deposited thereon a medicament. Following the deposition of the medicament another layer of edible film is deposited sealing the medicament. These films upon application to oral cavity release the medicament in controlled fashion. However, this invention does not discuss the fast dispersion/dissolution of the drug and drug loading issues in the fast dispersing films.<br>
[0008]A delivery device that addresses the above limitations would represent a desirable improvement on existing delivery systems.<br>
[0009]However, aforementioned film formulations and manufacturing methods have resulted in film dosage forms with limited ability to accommodate drug loading beyond small doses and usually in the in the range of 1 microgram to 10 milligrams. However, higher drug loading in the film formulation also results in increased disintegration/dissolution time leading to patient unpalatability.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
According to present invention where the polymer films are perforated, the drug loading in the film can be enhanced without compromising the fast dispersion/dissolution characteristics of the film dosage forms. As shown in the following examples there are some attempts to present the perforated oral films, however the objective of the prior art is different from the current invention.<br>
Perforated film prior art:<br>
[0010]United States Patent Application 20070071798 by Steve A. Herweck et al. relates to a bio-absorbable stand-alone film that has one or more perforations or depressions provided in the film structure, and the corresponding method of making. The perforations in the bio-absorbable stand-alone film allow the film to expand and conform to a three-dimensional surface of a tissue, even in embodiments where the bio-absorbable film itself is not elastic. The bio-absorbable stand-alone film is generally formed of a naturally occurring oil, or an oil composition formed in part of a naturally occurring oil. In addition, the oil composition can include a therapeutic agent component, such as a drug or other bioactive agent. The perforations in the bio-absorbable film can speed up the biological absorption of the film by allowing body fluids to contact a greater amount of surface area of the film compared to a film without perforations. The bio-absorbable stand-alone film is implantable in a patient for short term or long term applications. As impier'iefited herein, the bio-absorbable stand-alone film is a non-polymeric cross-linked gel derived at least in part from a fatty acid compound. The present invention is clearly for surgical application and not intended for immediate drug release for oral absorption. Additionally the films are based on non-polymeric cross linked gel consisting of fatty acids or oils which are not suitable for oral   perforations in the film preparation are intended for either holding the drug particles or allowing the body part to protrude through these perforations or allowing the surgical instruments to pass through. Therefore, the perforations referenced in this application are clearly misleading.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
[0011]United States Patent Application 20070259011 by Sagel et al, is for oral care products comprising a strip and one or more oral care compositions. The oral care composition comprises an oral care active and when applied to the teeth the oral care product delivers one or more oral care benefits. These oral care systems, preferably for dental care application strips may also be perforated. Perforations can be provided adjacent or below the oral care composition where it is desirable for the oral care active to more readily dissolves or otherwise diffuses into the oral cavity. The provided system is clearly for dental care application and not intended for systemic oral absorption as provided in the form of tablets or capsules or liquid preparations. More importantly this invention does not address the drug loading issues as solved by current invention.<br>
[0012]United States Patent Application 20070253990 by Sagel et al. relates to a tooth whitening strip of material having a shape adapted to fit a user's teeth. The strip of material is of a shape so that the strip   substantially cover the front side of at least the user's front four teeth and two canine teeth. The front sides of additional teeth may be covered. The tooth whitening strip will then fold over the tips and onto the back side of one or more of the front four teeth. However, the strip of material will not cover the tips of the two canine teeth. The strip of material may be of any shape that allows for the canines to protrude. Possible shapes include substantially trapezoidal with or without stair stepped sides or notches, and rectangular with notches, stair stepped sides, or recesses.<br>
[0013]Any of the sides or edges of the strip may be notched, stair stepped, or arched. By notched it is meant that there is a recess, indentation, or curve of some type. By stair stepped it is meant that the side is not straight and may contain one or more stair steps. The strip may also contain slits, cross-slits, holes, perforations, or any suitable formation that allows for the canines to protrude through or be avoided by the strip of material. In generally, a recess<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
should allow approximately 2 cm for protrusion of the canines. Certainly this invention by Sagel is for tooth whitening and does not address the issues of drug loading solved by current invention.<br>
[0014]United States Patent Application 20070237825 by Levy et al„ is a polymerized hydrogel composition for hydrating or dehydrating a surface, particularly a dermatological surface, to which it is applied and a method for forming the composition.<br>
[0015]One method offered for controlling the rate of release of water to skin surface from the hydrogel composition is by controlling the geometry of the composition itself and, thereby, its exposed surface area. For example, a sheet of the composition with a specified thickness can be designed having perforations of a specific diameter. Diffusion can occur through the surface of the hydrogel and through the surface area created by the edge of each hole. The increase in desorption rate from a perforated sheet compared with a non-perforated sheet can be calculated and predicted. Other geometries that can be produced to control the rate of water release include solid cylinders, hollow cylinders, and hollow cylinders with a non-circular central channel. An example of a cylinder with a non-circular central channel is a cylinder with an internal channel that is "star shaped". The surface area of the internal "star" can be designed to equal or exceed the surface area of the external surface of the cylinder. The external cross-section of the hydrogel composition can also be non-circular. Examples of non-circular external cross-sections include oval, square, ,and star-shaped cross-sections. The profile of the hydrogel compositions (internal and external cross-sections) can be designed to meet the required mechanical property criteria and the desired hydrating behavior for specific applications. This   does not address the delivery of drugs for oral systemic absorption.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
[0016]ln yet another United States Patent Application 20070003495 by Sage! et al., describing a method for whitening teeth are provided. The methods include the steps of providing a strip of material and applying a thin layer of a tooth whitening substance having a whitening active selected from the group consisting of peroxides, metal  , and combinations thereof to a front surface of a plurality of teeth, wherein the amount of the tooth whitening substance is between about 0.05 grams and about 0.4 grams. The method further includes the steps of conforming the strip of material to the front surface of the plurality of teeth and removing the strip of material. The strip may also contain slits, cross-slits, holes, perforations, or any suitable formation that allows for the canines to protrude through or be avoided by the strip of material. In generally, a recess should allow approximately 2 cm for protrusion of the canines. Therefore, the perforations offered into these strips clearly to allow the strips to lodge themselves onto the teeth.<br>
[0017]Similar perforations were provided for securing the teeth whitening strips in the UnitedStates Patent 7122199 issued to Sagel et al., however, the invention is not intended for systemic drug delivery of bioactive agents.<br>
[0018]ln yet another United States Patent Application 20050249782 Perry, Victor et al., is for a drug delivery device having the shape and size of a pocket card and including a drug dispersed in an edible material, is disclosed. The drug delivery device may be conveniently carried by a person, such as in the form of a cash or credit card, allowing easy access to the drug. The person may administer a dosage of the drug by ingesting all or part of the drug delivery device.<br><br>
or a plurality of dosages. If drug delivery device contains multiple doses, drug delivery device may be divided into a plurality of segments, each segment may correspond to one dose or part of a dose. Segments may be designed to easily be separated from the remainder of delivery device by breaking the device along<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
the sides of provided segregation perforations. The invention provided with perforations in this application is intended for dose segregation and by no means address the solution solved by current invention.<br>
[0020] United States Patent 6936291 granted to Weibel Michael K disclosed a process for continuous casting of edible cellulose-containing film sheets having unique physical characteristics. The cellulose film sheets have diverse applications in the processed food industry.<br>
[0021 ]The film sheets of the invention can be beneficially incorporated into a variety of comestible substances, and in particular, frozen or par-baked dough pieces, to which the film sheets are readily laminated. For example, the film sheets of the invention are useful as an edible baking substrate for frozen pizza products, as they have sufficient structural stability to resist the deformation of the pizza dough over the rods of an oven rack, which can result in uneven baking. The resulting film sheet can be formed into various shapes, e.g. by die-cutting or the like, depending on the intended use. The film sheets may also be perforated, if desired.   Therefore, the perforations in the invention are only to segregate the pieces for easy handling but not provided to address the fast dispersion/dissolution of the films.<br>
[0022]ln yet another United States Patent 20050186253 by Lee et al., discloses a method of manufacturing a bioactive fluid dose on an ingestible sheet, comprising the steps of advancing the ingestible sheet to a dispense position, and activating a fluid ejector to dispense essentially a drop of a bioactive fluid onto the ingestible sheet.<br>
 that contains perforations that delineates each dosage form. Preferably, after the bioactive fluid is dispensed on the dosage form the user or system separates the dosage form by tearing, by cutting along the perforations, or by punching out the dispensed areas of the sheet.   Therefore, this invention does not address the<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
problem of drug loading and fast dispersion/dissolution solved by current invention.<br>
[0024]The above mentioned patent applications and patents refer to the use of perforations in the edible polymer films in a non specific fashion. The perforations in most of the references in these patents are provided to either segregate the dose or a means to separate the individual doses by tearing along the sides of the perforations. In yet another invention these perforations are provided to secure the films in place. One patent addresses the faster dissolution of applied hydrogel as wound dressing but it is for only external application and treatment of wounds on dermis. Therefore the use of perorations in the films/strips is just a convention and conveniently misleading.<br>
Summary of invention:<br>
[0025] It is known to the pharmaceutical sciences that water soluble polymer based films can be used to deliver the drug substance to oral cavity. However, the thickness of such films needs to be substantially thin in order to achieve rapid dissolution on the tongue upon application on the tongue. This requirement significantly limits the drug loading capacity of the films restricting the application of the technology to only low dose drug delivery. Additionally, any increase in thickness of the film results in increased dissolution/dispersion times. These disadvantages render these delivery systems as less palatable to patients.<br>
[0026]A primary objective of the present invention is to provide a oral fast dispersible/dissolvable edible polymer based perforated film/strip dosage form that will overcome the shortcomings of the prior art and provide a system that will<br>
increased drug loading.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
[0027]The current invention particularly addresses the issues posed by earlier<br>
inventions such as fast dispersion/dissolution and drug loading limitations.<br>
Therefore, allowing these delivery systems to be flexible to accommodate higher<br>
drug loads without compromising the fast dispersion/dissolution characteristics.<br>
Additionally, this invention provides much faster dispersion/dissolution to the<br>
system even at low drug load. The current invention also enables the use of<br>
polymers that would othen/vise have not been used due to lower water solubility.<br>
[0028]Accordingly, an objective of the current invention is to provide microperforated or perforated water soluble polymer based edible films for the oral delivery of drugs.<br>
[0029]Another objective of the invention is to provide a means for the faster dosage form dissolution or dispersion after dosage form administration.<br>
[0030]Another objective of the invention is to provide a means to accommodate higher drug loads into the delivery system without compromising the dispersion/dissolution rates.<br>
[0031]Another objective of the invention is to improve the ability of the strip/film to accommodate higher drug loading while preserving fast dispersion/dissolution characteristics.<br>
[0032]Another objective of the invention is to improve the ability of the strip/film dosage form to disperse/dissolve faster even for low drug loaded thinner films. Additionally, present invention enables the usage of those polymers otherwise  <br>
[0033]Another objective of the current invention is to allow delivery of drugs to oral cavity at various dose levels. Provide the dosage form with lower/higher doses while preserving fast dispersion/dissolution rates.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
[0034]Another objective of the invention is to provide increased dissolution surface area to the delivery system for the enhanced dissolution/dispersion.<br>
[0035]Another objective of the invention is to provide flexible usage of polymers, which could otherwise not be suitable for the preparation of dosage form.<br>
[0036]Another objective of the invention is to provide means to incorporate low water soluble drugs into these dosage forms for effective delivery.<br>
[0037]The general purpose of the present invention is to provide a new oral drug delivery system that has several advantages over other forms and novel features that result in new oral drup delivery system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious or even implied by any of the prior art of oral cavity delivery system.<br>
To attain this, the present invention generally consists of polymer, plasticizer, buffer agent, disintegrants, effervescence agents, sweeteners and drug formed into a flexible film.<br>
[0038]Generally the polymers include either water soluble polymers or pH dependent polymers or thermoplastic polymers or combination thereof along with suitable amounts of water soluble/ water miscible/ water insoluble plasticizers, buffering agents, disintegrants, effervescence agents, flavorants, sweeteners, emulsifying agents and suitable amounts of drug substance. The drug substance can be from any class of drugs either acidic or basic or zwitterionic. The dose range of these drugs can be from few micro grams to few hundred milligrams. The resultant combination ottnese polymers, plasucizeis,   disintegrants, effervescence agents, flavorants, sweeteners and drugs can be a solution, suspension or emulsion which can be spread to form films upon drying.<br><br>
RAMESH BANGALORE<br>
[0039]These systems can be made either in the presence of water or any suitable organic solvent or combination of both.<br>
[0040]Such prepared films usually contain drug levels in higher percentages or at same percentage as present commonly known films on the market. Additionally, these films can be dissolved or dispersed in oral cavity at faster rates than traditional films due to the presence of perforations throughout the body of the strip.<br>
[0041 ]The perforations can be made in the body of the film by several known methods such use of pins/punches or laser drills or mechanical drijis or conventional methods. The holes can be of any shape and size, however, the film upon perforations still provide specific amounts of drug when ingested.<br>
[0042]These and other details of invention will be described in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are furnished only by the way of illustration and not in limitation of the invention, and in which drawings:<br>

burning with pins into films, laser burning or formed during the layering of the<br>
film forming material on to a protruded base film surface which is finally peeled to<br>
provide holes in the films.<br>
[0050]ln the embodiment of invention, the perforations are made into films of various thicknesses. The thickness of the film forms basis for the number of perforations in the film leading to faster dispersion/dissolution of the films in the oral cavity/body cavity/body surface of any subject including humans and animals.<br>
[0051]ln embodiments of the invention, the dosage unit may further include any of the following features: a dry film thickness in the range of 1-50 mil, more particularly less than 20 mils, a tensile strength greater than SOOpsi, a modulus in the range of 15,000-200,000 psi, a tear propagation resistance in the range 0.0001 N-1N, a disintegration time in a range from 1-600 seconds, a dissolution time in a range from 10-1000 seconds, and a percentage elongation less than 20%.<br>
[0052]ln embodiments of the invention, manufacturing process for the films are provided.   The typical process includes dissolution/dispersion of the film forming material either in water or a suitable solvent or a mixture thereof. To the polymer solution mix bioactive agent which is previously<br>
dissolved/solubilized/suspended/emulsified/otherwise dispersed by known pharmaceutical practices is added under agitation to result in homogenous mixture. Alternatively, the bioactive agent may also be dissolved/solubilized/suspended/emulsified/otherwise dispersed by known pharmaceutical practices directly into the polymer/polymer solution.

one reagent selected from the group consisting of an emulsifier, a plasticizer, a<br>
taste modifier, a water soluble inert filler, a coloring agent, a preservative, a<br>
permeation enhancer, a stabilizer, and a buffering agent, may be combined in<br>
any order in a vessel equipped with heating mechanism such as steam jacket<br>
and a mechanical mixing device. The resultant mixture is then applied onto a<br>
backing film using a known coating mechanisms such as doctor knife or reverse<br>
roll coating etc. The coated backing film then passed through a drying chamber<br>
assembly where the heated air at predetermined temperatures is blown on to the<br>
film to remove the water/solvent/combination thereof at a predetermined rate<br>
from the film.<br>
[0053]The perforations into the film are formed by one of the methods including passing the exiting coated film through as roller punching mechanism/drilling mechanism. The perforations are formed into the film by laser drilling the holes upon exit of the film from the drying chamber. The perforations are also formed by bringing the film surface in contact with hot pins. Alternatively, the holes/perforations can be formed in the film by any of the aforementioned methods or other methods prior to packaging but soon after peeling it from the backing film. Yet another method of forming the perforations is by means of forming a matrix of the film while coating on to the backing film or by effervesce carbon dioxide evolution during coating of the film. Nonetheless, as can be perceived by a skilled pharmaceutical formulation experts that other perforations formation methods not mentioned in this invention should not be considered as<br>

The dosage form may be administered to the subject by placing the film on body cavity or surface.<br>
[0058]Embodiments of the invention provide a delivery system for bioactive agents and other active agents that will fast disperse/dissolve and completely release their contents on the applied surface such as tongue. The release of the active agent occurs without mastication or the need for intake of water. However, the dosage form can be administered with aid of water if needed. Futhermore,<br><br>

embodiments of the invention further provide improvements that include: improved organoleptic properties (smell and taste), and texture and feel of dosage forms Intended to be placed in the oral cavity; a dosage form which "melts" in the mouth and leaves a smooth pleasant after feel following dissolution; Depending on the optimal program for a specific application of the invention, the disintegration time and the dissolution time can be controlled within a prescribed range by adjustment of the formulation and the thickness of the film. In some cases, it is desirable for release of the active agent to occur after dissolution of the film. For these applications, the active agent may be encapsulated in a material with dissolution properties that are different from those of the hydrocolloid. Encapsulation of the active agent also may be utilized to achieve masking of taste for active agents that are bitter. In some cases, two or more different active agents may be included in the film. An example where multiple active agents frequently are administered is cold medications, which often contain several active agents.<br>
