METHODS FOR PRODUCTION OF POLYOLS FROM OILS AND PRODUCTION OF POLYESTERS AND POLYURETHANES<br>
The invention provides for methods to convert vegetable and/or animal oils (e.g.<br>
soybean oil) to highly functionalized alcohols in essentially quantitative yields by an<br>
ozonolysis process. The functionalized alcohols are useful for further reaction to produce<br>
polyesters and polyurethanes. The invention provides a process that is able to utilize<br>
renewable resources such as oils and fats derived from plants and animals.<br>
Polyols are very useful for the production of polyurethane-based coatings and<br>
foams as well as polyester applications. Soybean oil, which is composed primarily of<br>
unsaturated fatty acids, is a potential precursor for the production of polyols by adding<br>
hydroxyl functionality to its numerous double bonds. It is desirable that this hydroxyl<br>
functionality be primary rather than secondary to achieve enhanced polyol reactivity in the<br>
preparation of polyurethanes and polyesters from isocyanates and carboxylic acids,<br>
anhydrides, acid chlorides or esters, respectively. One disadvantage of soybean oil that<br>
needs a viable solution is the fact that about 16 percent of its fatty acids are saturated and<br>
thus not readily amenable to hydroxylation.<br>
One type of soybean oil modification described in the literature uses<br>
hydroformylation to add hydrogen and formyl groups across its double bonds, followed by<br>
reduction of these formyl groups to hydroxymefhyl groups. Whereas this approach does<br>
produce primary hydroxyl groups, disadvantages include the fact that expensive transition<br>
metal catalysts are needed in both steps and only one hydroxyl group is introduced per<br>
original double bond. Monohydroxylation of soybean oil by epoxidation followed by<br>
hydrogenation or direct double bond hydration (typically accompanied with undesired<br>
triglyceride hydrolysis) results in generation of one secondary hydroxyl group per original<br>
double bond. The addition of two hydroxyl groups across soybean oil's double bonds<br>
(dihydroxylation) either requires transition metal catalysis or stoichiometric use of<br>
expensive reagents such as permanganate while generating secondary rather than primary<br>
hydroxyl groups.<br>
The literature discloses the low temperature ozonolysis of alkenes with simple<br>
alcohols and boron trifluoride catalyst followed by reflux to produce esters. See J.<br><br>
Neumeister, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., Vol. 17, p. 939, (1978) and J.L. Sebedio, et al.,<br>
Chemistry and Physics of Lipids, Vol. 35, p. 21 (1984). A probable mechanism for the<br>
low temperature ozonolysis discussed above is shown in Figure 1. They have shown that<br>
a molozonide is generated at relatively low temperatures in the presence of an alcohol and<br>
a Bronsted or Lewis acid and that the aldehyde can be captured by conversion to its acetal<br>
and the carbonyl oxide can be captured by conversion to an alkoxy hydroperoxide. In the<br>
presence of ozone the aldehyde acetal is converted to the corresponding hydrotrioxide at<br>
relatively low temperatures. If the reaction temperature is then raised to general reflux<br>
temperature, the hydrotrioxide fragments to form an ester by loss of oxygen and one<br>
equivalent of original alcohol. At elevated temperatures, and in the presence of an acid<br>
such as boron trifluoride, the alkoxy hydroperoxide will eliminate water to also form an<br>
ester in essentially quantitative yields. This overall process converts each olefinic carbon<br>
to the carbonyl carbon of an ester group so that two ester groups are produced from each<br>
double bond.<br>
One broad embodiment of the invention provides for a method for producing an<br>
ester. The method includes reacting a biobased oil, oil derivative, or modified oil with<br>
ozone and excess alcohol at a temperature between about -80°C to about 80°C to produce<br>
intermediate products; and refluxing the intermediate products or further reacting at lower<br>
than reflux temperature; wherein esters are produced from the intermediate products at<br>
double bond sites, and substantially all of the fatty acids are transesterified to esters at the<br>
glyceride sites. The esters can be optionally amidified, if desired.<br>
Another broad embodiment of the invention provides a method for producing<br>
amides. The method includes amidifying a biobased oil, or oil derivative so that<br>
substantially all of the fatty acids are amidified at the glyceride sites; reacting the<br>
amidified biobased oil, or oil derivative with ozone and excess alcohol at a temperature<br>
between about -80°C to about 80°C to produce intermediate products; refluxing the<br>
intermediate products or further reacting at lower than reflux temperature, wherein esters<br>
are produced from the intermediate products at double bond sites to produce a hybrid<br>
ester/amide.<br><br>
Figure 1 is a schematic depicting the reactions involved in the two stage ozonolysis<br>
of a generalized double bond in the presence of an alcohol and the catalyst boron<br>
trifluoride.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic depicting the reactions involved in the two stage ozonolysis<br>
of a generalized double bond in the presence of a polyol and the catalyst boron trifluoride.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic depicting the steps and specific products involved in<br>
converting an idealized soybean oil molecule by ozonolysis and triglyceride<br>
transesterification in the presence of glycerin and boron trifluoride to an ester alcohol with<br>
the relative proportions of the individual fatty acids indicated. The primary processes and<br>
products from each fatty acid are shown.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic depicting the steps involved in converting an idealized<br>
soybean molecule by ozonolysis and triglyceride transesterification in the presence of<br>
methanol and boron trifluoride to cleaved methyl esters as intermediates. The primary<br>
processes and intermediates from each fatty acid are indicated.<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic depicting the amidification processes and products starting<br>
with the intermediate cleaved methyl esters (after initial ozonolysis and triglyceride<br>
transesterification) and then reacting with diethanolamine to produce the final amide<br>
alcohol product.<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method to prepare vegetable oil<br>
ester alcohols by initial preparation of alkyl esters followed by transesterification with<br>
glycerin or any polyol.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic depicting the amidification of triglyceride fatty acids at the<br>
triglyceride backbone to generate fatty acid amide alcohols.<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic depicting the tranesterifcation of the fatty acids at the<br>
triglyceride backbone to generate fatty acid ester alcohols.<br>
Figure 9 shows the major azelaic (C9) components in soybean oil ester polyols and<br>
mixed polyols.<br>
Figure 10 shows examples of various azelaic amide polyols and hybrid amide<br>
polyols which can made using the methods of the present invention.<br>
Figure 11 shows examples of various hybrid soybean ester and amide polyols<br>
which can be made using the methods of the present invention.<br><br>
Broadly, the present invention provides for the ozonolysis and transesterification of<br>
biobased oils, oil derivatives, or modified oils to generate highly functionalized esters,<br>
ester alcohols, amides, and amide alcohols. By biobased oils, we mean vegetable oils or<br>
animal fats having at least one triglyceride backbone, wherein at least one fatty acid has at<br>
least one double bond. By biobased oil derivatives, we mean derivatives of biobased oils,<br>
such as hydroformylated soybean oil, hydrogenated epoxidized soybean oil, and the like<br>
wherein fatty acid derivatization occurs along the fatty acid backbone. By biobased<br>
modified oils, we mean biobased oils which have been modified by transesterification of<br>
the fatty acids at the triglyceride backbone.<br>
Ozonolysis of olefins is typically performed at moderate to elevated temperatures<br>
whereby the initially formed molozonide rearranges to the ozonide which is then<br>
converted to a variety of products. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
presently believed that the mechanism of this rearrangement involves dissociation into an<br>
aldehyde and an unstable carbonyl oxide which recombine to form the ozonide. The<br>
disclosure herein provides for low temperature ozonolysis of fatty acids that produces an<br>
ester alcohol product without any ozonide, or substantially no ozonide as shown in Figure<br>
2. It has been discovered that if a polyol such as glycerin is used in this process (and in<br>
excess) that mainly one hydroxyl group will be used to generate ester functionality and the<br>
remaining alcohol groups will remain pendant in generating ester glycerides.<br>
One basic method involves the combined ozonolysis and transesterification of a<br>
biobased oil, oil derivative, or modified oil to produce esters. As shown in Figure 1, if a<br>
monoalcohol is used, the process produces an ester. As shown in Figure 2, if a polyol is<br>
used, an ester alcohol is made.<br>
The process typically includes the use of an ozonolysis catalyst. The ozonolysis<br>
catalyst is generally a Lewis acid or a Bronsted acid. Suitable catalysts include, but are<br>
not limited to, boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, boron tribromide, tin halides (such as<br>
tin chlorides), aluminum halides (such as aluminum chlorides), zeolites (solid acid),<br>
molecular sieves (solid acid), sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, acetic acid, and<br>
hydrohalic acids (such as hydrochloric acid). The ozonolysis catalyst can be a resin-bound<br>
acid catalyst, such as SiliaBond propylsulfonic acid, or Amberlite" IR-120 (macroreticular<br>
or gellular resins or silica covalently bonded to sulfonic acid or carboxylic acid groups).<br><br>
One advantage of a solid acid or resin-bound acid catalyst is that it can be removed from<br>
the reaction mixture by simple filtration.<br>
The process generally takes place at a temperature in a range of about -80°C to<br>
about 80°C, typically about 0°C to about 40°C.. or about 10°C to about 20°C.<br>
The process can take place in the presence of a solvent, if desired. Suitable<br>
solvents include, but are not limited to, ester solvents, ketone solvents, chlorinated<br>
solvents, amide solvents, or combinations thereof. Examples of suitable solvents include,<br>
but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, chloroform, methylene<br>
chloride, and N-methylpyrrolidinone.<br>
When the alcohol is a polyol, an ester alcohol is produced. Suitable polyols<br>
include, but are not limited to, glycerin, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, or propylene<br>
glycol, alditols such as sorbitol and other aldoses and ketoses such as glucose and fructose.<br>
When the alcohol is a monoalcohol, the process may proceed too slowly to be<br>
practical in a commercial process and the extended reaction time can lead to undesired<br>
oxidation of the monoalcohol by ozone. Therefore, it may be desirable to include an<br>
oxidant. Suitable oxidants include, but are not limited to, hydrogen peroxide, Oxone®<br>
(potassium peroxymonosulfate), Caro's acid, or combinations thereof.<br>
The use of a modified oil, which has been transesterified to esters at the fatty acid<br>
glyceride sites before reacting with the ozone and excess alcohol, allows the production of<br>
hybrid C9 or azelate esters (the major component in the reaction mixture) in which the<br>
ester on one end of the azelate diester is different from the ester on the other end. In order<br>
to produce a hybrid ester composition, the alcohol used in ozonolysis is different from the<br>
alcohol used to transesterify the esters at the fatty acid glyceride sites.<br>
The esters produced by the process can optionally be amidified to form amides.<br>
One method of amidifying the esters to form amides is by reacting an amine alcohol with<br>
the esters to form the amides. The amidifying process can include heating the ester/amine<br>
alcohol mixture, distilling the ester/amine alcohol mixture, and/or refluxing the<br>
ester/amine alcohol mixture, in order too drive the reaction to completion. An amidifying<br>
catalyst can be used, although this is not necessary if the amine alcohol is ethanolamine,<br>
due to its relatively short reaction times, or if the reaction is allowed to proceed for<br><br>
suitable periods of time. Suitable catalysts include, but are not limited to, boron<br>
trifluoride, sodium methoxide, sodium iodide, sodium cyanide, or combinations thereof.<br>
Another broad embodiment of the invention provides a method for producing<br>
amides. The method includes amidifying a biobased oil, or oil derivative so that<br>
substantially all of the fatty acids are amidified at the triglyceride sites, as shown in Figure<br>
7. The amidified biobased oil, or oil derivative is then reacted with ozone and excess<br>
alcohol to produce esters at the double bond sites. This process allows the production of<br>
hybrid ester/amides.<br>
The ester in the hybrid ester/amide can optionally be amidified. If a different<br>
amine alcohol is used for the initial amidification process from that used in the second<br>
amidification process, then Cg or azelaic acid hybrid diamides (the major component in the<br>
reaction mixture) will be produced in which the amide functionality on one end of the<br>
molecule is different from the amide functionality on the other end.<br>
ESTER POLYOLS<br>
The following section discusses the production of highly functionalized glyceride<br>
alcohols (or glyceride polyols) from soybean oil by ozonolysis in the presence of glycerin<br>
and boron trifluoride as shown in Figure 3. Glycerin is a leading ester polyol precursor<br>
candidate since it is projected to be produced in high volume as a byproduct in the<br>
production of methyl soyate (biodiesel). Other candidate reactant polyols include<br>
propylene glycol (a diol), trimethylolpropane (a triol) and pentaerythritol (a tetraol),<br>
alditols such as sorbitol and other aldoses and ketoses such as glucose and fructose.<br>
Broadly, ozonolysis of soybean oil is typically performed in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, such as catalytic quantities of boron trifluoride (e.g., 0.06-0.25 equivalents), and<br>
excess glycerin (e.g. four equivalents of glycerin) (compared to the number of reactive<br>
double bond plus triglyceride sites) at about -80°C to about 80°C (preferably about 0°C to<br>
about 40°C) in a solvent such as those disclosed herein.<br>
It is expected that dehydrating agents such as molecular sieves and magnesium<br>
sulfate will stabilize the ester product by reducing product ester hydrolysis during the<br>
reflux stage based on chemical precedents.<br><br>
Completion of ozonolysis was indicated by an external potassium iodide/starch test<br>
solution, and the reaction mixture was refluxed typically one hour or more in the same<br>
reaction vessel. Boron trifluoride was removed by treatment with sodium carbonate, and<br>
the resulting ethyl acetate solution was washed with water to remove excess glycerin.<br>
One benefit of using boron trifluoride as the catalyst is that it also functions as an<br>
effective transesterification catalyst so that the excess glycerin also undergoes<br>
transesterification reactions at the site of original fatty acid triglyceride backbone while<br>
partially or completely displacing the original glycerin from the fatty acid. Although not<br>
wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this transesterification process occurs<br>
during the reflux stage following the lower temperature ozonolysis. Other Lewis and<br>
Bronsted acids can also function as transesterification catalysts (see the list elsewhere<br>
herein).<br>
Combined proton NMR and IR spectroscopy confirmed that the primary processes<br>
and products starting with an idealized soybean oil molecule showing the relative<br>
proportions of individual fatty acids are mainly 1-monoglycerides as indicated in Figure 3.<br>
However, some 2-monoglycerides and diglycerides are also produced. Figure 3 illustrates<br>
typical reactions for an idealized soybean oil molecule. Figure 3 also shows that<br>
monoglyceride groups become attached to each original olefinic carbon atom and the<br>
original fatty acid carboxylic groups are also transesterified primarily to monoglyceride<br>
groups to generate a mixture of primarily 1-monoglycerides, 2-monoglycerides and<br>
diglycerides. Thus, not only are the unsaturated fatty acid groups multiply derivatized by<br>
glycerin, but the 16% saturated fatty acids are also converted primarily to monoglycerides<br>
by transesterification at their carboxylic acid sites.<br>
Excess glycerin (four equivalents) was used in order to produce primarily<br>
monoglycerides at the double bond sites and minimize formation of diglycerides and<br>
triglycerides by further reaction of pendant product alcohol groups with the ozonolysis<br>
intermediates. However, diglycerides can still function as polyols since they have<br>
available hydroxyl groups. One typical structure for diglycerides is shown below as<br>
Formula I.<br><br><br>
This follows since the higher the concentration of glycerin, the greater the<br>
probability that, once a hydroxyl group of a glycerin molecule (preferentially primary<br>
hydroxyl groups) reacts with either the aldehyde or carbonyl oxide intermediates, the<br>
remaining hydroxyl groups in that molecule will not also be involved in these type<br>
reactions.<br>
1-Monoglycerides have a 1:1 combination of primary and secondary hydroxyl<br>
groups for preparation of polyurethanes and polyesters. The combination of more reactive<br>
primary hydroxyl groups and less reactive secondary hydroxyl groups may lead to rapid<br>
initial cures and fast initial viscosity building followed by a slower final cure. However,<br>
when using starting polyols comprised substantially exclusively of primary hydroxyl<br>
groups such as trimethylolpropane or pentaerythritol, substantially all pendant hydroxyl<br>
groups will necessarily be primary in nature and have about equal initial reactivity.<br>
The theoretical weight for the preparation of soybean oil monoglycerides shown<br>
above is about two times the starting weight of soybean oil, and the observed yields were<br>
close to this factor. Thus, the materials cost for this transformation is close to the average<br>
of the per pound cost of soybean oil and glycerin.<br>
Glyceride alcohols obtained were clear and colorless and had low to moderately<br>
low viscosities. When ethyl acetate is used as the solvent, hydroxyl values range from 230<br>
to approximately 350, acid values ranged from about 2 to about 12, and glycerin contents<br>
were reduced to 
When ester solvents such as ethyl acetate are used, there is a potential for a side<br>
reaction in the production of vegetable oil glyceride alcohols (example for soybean oil<br>
shown in Figure 3), or ester alcohols in general, that involves the transesterification of the<br>
free hydroxyl groups in these products with the solvent ester to form ester-capped<br>
hydroxyl groups. When ethyl acetate is used, acetate esters are formed at the hydroxyl<br>
sites, resulting in capping of some hydroxyl groups so that they are no longer available for<br>
further reaction to produce foams and coatings. If the amount of ester capping is<br>
increased, the hydroxyl value will be decreased, thus providing a means to reduce and<br>
adjust hydroxyl values. Ester capping may also be desirable since during purification of<br><br>
polyol products by water washing, the water solubility of the product ester alcohol is<br>
correspondingly decreased leading to lower polyol product loss in the aqueous layer.<br>
Several methods are available to control ester capping reactions, and thus the<br>
hydroxyl value of the ester alcohol.<br>
One method is shown in Figure 6, which illustrates an alternate approach to<br>
prepare vegetable oil glyceride alcohols, or ester alcohols in general, by reacting<br>
(transesterifying) the vegetable oil methyl ester mixture (shown in Figure 4), or any<br>
vegetable oil alkyl ester mixture, with glycerin, or any other polyol such as<br>
trimethylolpropane or pentaerythritol, to form the same product composition shown in<br>
Figure 3, or related ester alcohols if esters are not used as solvents in the transesterification<br>
step. Also, if esters are used as solvents in transesterifying the mixture of Figure 4 (alkyl<br>
esters) with a polyol, a shorter reaction time would be expected compared to<br>
transesterification of the fatty acids at the triglyceride backbone (as shown in Figure 3),<br>
thus leading to decreased ester capping of the hydroxyl groups. This method has merit in<br>
its own right, but involves one extra step than the sequence shown in Figure 3.<br>
Another method of controlling the ester capping in general is to use solvents that<br>
are not esters (such as amides such as NMP (l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and DMF (N,N-<br>
dimethyl formamide); ketones, or chlorinated solvents) and can not enter into<br>
transesterification reactions with the product or reactant hydroxyl groups. Alternatively,<br>
"hindered esters" such as alkyl (methyl, ethyl, etc.) pivalates (alkyl 2,2-<br>
dimethylpropionates) and alkyl 2-methylpropionates (isobutyrates) can be used. This type<br>
of hindered ester should serve well as an alternate recyclable solvent for vegetable oils and<br>
glycerin, while its tendency to enter into transesterification reactions (as ethyl acetate<br>
does) should be significantly impeded due to steric hindrance. The use of isobutyrates and<br>
pivalates provides the good solubilization properties of esters without ester capping to<br>
provide maximum hydroxyl value as desired.<br>
Another way to control the ester capping is to vary the reflux time. Increasing the<br>
reflux time increases the amount of ester capping if esters are used as ozono lysis solvents.<br>
, Ester capping of polyol functionality can also be controlled by first transesterifying<br>
the triglyceride backbone, as shown in Figure 8 and described in Example 2, and then<br><br>
performing ozonolysis, as described in Example 3, resulting in a shorter reaction time<br>
when esters are used as solvents.<br>
Water washing of the product in ethyl acetate solutions has been used to remove<br>
the excess glycerin. Because of the high hydroxyl content of many of these products,<br>
water partitioning leads to extreme loss of ester polyol yield. It is expected that using<br>
water containing the appropriate amount of dissolved salt (sodium chloride or others) will<br>
lead to reduced product loss currently observed with water washing. Even though not<br>
demonstrated, the excess glycerin used presumably can be separated from water washes by<br>
simple distillation.<br>
In order to remove the acid catalyst boron trifluoride effectively without water<br>
partitioning, basic resins, such as Amberlyst1" A-21 and Amberlyst" A-26 (macroreticular<br>
or gellular resins of silica covalently bonded to amine groups or quaternary ammonium<br>
hydroxide), have been used. The use of these resins may also be beneficial because of<br>
potential catalyst recycling by thermal treatment to release boron trifluoride from either<br>
resin or by chemical treatment with hydroxide ion. Sodium carbonate has been used to<br>
scavenge and also decompose the boron trifluoride catalyst.<br>
The present invention allows the preparation of a unique mixture of components<br>
that are all end functionalized with alcohol or polyol groups. Evidence indicates when<br>
these mixtures are reacted with polyisocyanates to form polyurethanes, that the resulting<br>
mixtures of polyurethanes components plasticize each other so that a very low glass<br>
transition temperature for the mixed polyurethane has been measured. This glass<br>
transition is about 100°C lower than expected based solely on hydroxyl values of other<br>
biobased polyols, none of which have been transesterified or amidified at the glyceride<br>
backbone. Also, the polyols derived from these cleaved fatty acids have lower viscosities<br>
and higher molecular mobilities compared to these non-cleaved biobased polyols, leading<br>
to more efficient reactions with polyisocyanates and molecular incorporation into the<br>
polymer matrix. This effect is manifested in polyurethanes derived from the polyols of the<br>
present invention giving significantly lower extractables in comparison to other biobased<br>
polyols when extracted with a polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylacetamide.<br><br>
AMIDE ALCOHOLS<br>
The following section discusses the production of highly functionalized amide<br>
alcohols from soybean oil by ozonolysis in the presence of methanol and boron trifluoride<br>
followed by amidification with amine alcohols. Refer now to Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Ozonolysis of soybean oil was performed in the presence of catalytic quantities of<br>
boron trifluoride (0.25 equivalent with respect to all reactive sites) at 20-40°C in methanol<br>
as the reactive solvent. It is anticipated that significantly lower concentrations of boron<br>
trifluoride or other Lewis or Bronsted acids could be used in this ozonolysis step (see the<br>
list of catalysts specified elsewhere). Completion of ozonolysis was indicated by an<br>
external potassium iodide/starch test solution. This reaction mixture was then typically<br>
refluxed typically one hour in the same reaction vessel. As stated previously, in addition<br>
to serving as a catalyst in the dehydration of intermediate methoxy hydroperoxides and the<br>
conversion of aldehydes to acetals, boron trifluoride also serves as an effective<br>
transesterification catalyst to generate a mixture of methyl esters at the original fatty acid<br>
ester sites at the triglyceride backbone while displacing glycerin from the triglyceride. It<br>
is anticipated that other Lewis and Bronsted acids can be used for this purpose. Thus, not<br>
only are all double bond carbon atoms of unsaturated fatty acid groups converted to<br>
methyl esters by methanol, but the 16% saturated fatty acids are also converted to methyl<br>
esters by transesterification at their carboxylic acid sites. Combined proton NMR and IR<br>
spectroscopy and GC analyses indicate that the primary processes and products starting<br>
with an idealized soybean oil molecule showing the relative proportions of individual fatty<br>
acids are mainly as indicated in Figure 4.<br>
Amidification of the methyl ester mixture was performed with the amine alcohols<br>
diethanolamine, diisopropanolamine, N-methylethanolamine, N-ethylethanolamine, and<br>
ethanolamine. These reactions typically used 1.2-1.5 equivalents of amine and were<br>
driven to near completion by ambient pressure distillation of the excess methanol solvent and the methanol released during amidification, or just heat under reflux, or at lower<br>
temperatures. These amidification reactions were catalyzed by boron trifluoride or sodium<br>
methoxide which were removed after this reaction was complete by treatment with the<br>
strong base resins Amberlyst A-26® or the strong acid resin Amberlite®IR-120,<br>
respectively. Removal of boron trifluoride was monitored by flame tests on copper wire<br><br>
wherein boron trifluoride gives a green flame. After amidification reactions with amine<br>
alcohols, excess amine alcohols were removed by short path distillation using a Kugelrohr<br>
short path distillation apparatus at temperatures typically ranging from 70°C to 125°C and<br>
pressures ranging from 0.02-0.5 Torr.<br>
Combined proton NMR and IR spectroscopy indicate that the primary<br>
amidification processes and products starting with the cleaved methyl esters after initial<br>
ozonolysis and then reacting with an amine alcohol such as diethanolamine are mainly as<br>
indicated below in Figure 5. Thus, not only are the unsaturated fatty acid groups of<br>
soybean oil multiply converted to amide alcohols or amide polyols at their olefinic sites as<br>
well as the fatty acid triglyceride sites, but the 16% saturated fatty acids are also converted<br>
to amide alcohols or amide polyols at their fatty acid sites.<br>
The boron trifluoride catalyst may be recycled by co-distillation during distillation<br>
of excess diethanolamine, due to strong complexation of boron trifluoride with amines.<br>
One problem that has been identified is the oxidation of monoalcohols such as<br>
methanol, that is used both as a solvent and reactant, by ozone to oxidized products (such<br>
as formic acid, which is further oxidized to formate esters, when methanol is used).<br>
Methods that have been evaluated to minimize this problem are listed below:<br>
(1). Perform ozonolysis at decreased temperatures, ranging from about -78°C (dry ice<br>
temperature) to about 20°C;<br>
(2). Perform ozonolysis reaction with alcohols less prone to oxidation than methanol such<br>
as primary alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, etc.), secondary alcohols (2-propanol,<br>
2-hydroxybutane, etc.), or tertiary alcohols, such as tertiary-butanol;<br>
(3). Perform ozonolysis reaction using alternate ozone non-reactive cosolvents (esters,<br>
ketones, tertiary amides, ketones, chlorinated solvents) where any monoalcohol used as a<br>
reagent is present in much lower concentrations and thus would compete much less<br>
effectively for oxidation with ozone.<br>
The boron trifluoride catalyst may be recycled by co-distillation during distillation<br>
of excess diethanolamine, due to strong complexation of boron trifluoride with amines.<br>
All examples herein are merely illustrative of typical aspects of the invention and<br>
are not meant to limit the invention in any way.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
This example shows a procedure for making glyceride alcohols or primarily<br>
soybean oil monoglycerides as shown in Figure 3 (also including products such as those in<br>
Figure 9 A, B, C).<br>
All steps for making glyceride alcohols were performed under a blanket of Argon.<br>
The ozonolysis of soybean oil was carried out by first weighing 20.29 grams of soybean<br>
oil (0.02306 mole; 0.02036 x 12 = 0.2767 mole double bond plus triglyceride reactive<br>
sites) and 101.34 grams of glycerol (1.10 mole; 4 fold molar excess) into a 500 mL 3-neck<br>
round bottom flask. A magnetic stirrer, ethyl acetate (300 mL) and boron trifluoride<br>
diethyl etherate (8.65 mL) were added to the round bottom flask. A thermocouple, sparge<br>
tube, and condenser (with a gas inlet attached to a bubbler containing potassium iodide (1<br>
wt %) in starch solution (1%) were attached to the round bottom flask. The round bottom<br>
flask was placed into a water-ice bath on a magnetic stir plate to maintain the internal<br>
temperature at 10-20°C, and ozone was bubbled through the sparge tube into the mixture<br>
for 2 hours until the reaction was indicated to be complete by appearance of a blue color in<br>
the iodine-starch solution. The sparge tube and ice-water bath were removed, and a<br>
heating mantle was used to reflux this mixture for 1 hour.<br>
After cooling to room temperature, sodium carbonate (33 g) was added to<br>
neutralize the boron trifluoride. This mixture was stirred overnight, after which distilled<br>
water (150 mL) was added and the mixture was again stirred well. The ethyl acetate layer<br>
was removed in a separatory funnel and remixed with distilled water (lOOmL) for 3<br>
minutes. The ethyl acetate layer was placed into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask and dried<br>
with sodium sulfate. Once dry, the solution was filtered using a coarse fritted Buchner<br>
funnel, and the solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator (60°C at approximately 2<br>
Torr). The final weight of this product was 41.20 grams which corresponded to a yield of<br>
84.2% when the theoretical yield was based on the exclusive formation of<br>
monoglycerides. The acid and hydroxyl values were 3.8 and 293.1 respectively. Proton<br>
NMR Spectroscopy yielded a complex spectrum, but the major portion matched the<br>
spectrum of bis(2,3-dihydroxy-l-propyl)azelate based on comparisons to authentic 1-<br>
monoglyceride esters.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
This example shows the production of soybean oil transesterified with propylene<br>
glycol or glycerin as shown in Figure 8.<br>
Soybean oil was added to a flask containing propylene glycol (1 mole soybean<br>
oil/6 mole propylene glycol) and lithium carbonate (1.5 wt% of soybean oil), and the flask<br>
was heated at 185°C for 14 hrs. The product was rinsed with hot distilled water and dried.<br>
Proton NMR spectroscopy indicated the presence of 1-propylene glycol monoester and no<br>
mono-, di- or triglycerides.<br>
When reacting with glycerol, a working ratio of 1 mole soybean oil/20 mole<br>
glycerol was used when the reaction was performed at 220°C for 100 hrs to maximize the<br>
amount of monoglycerides that gave a composition containing 70% monoglycerides, 29%<br>
diglycerides and a trace of triglyceride (glyceryl soyate).<br>
Example 3<br>
This example shows production of a mixed ester alcohol, as in Fig. 9D.<br>
Soybean oil was initially transesterified with glycerin as specified in Example 2 to<br>
produce glyceryl soyate. 50.0 g glyceryl soyate was reacted with ozone in the presence of<br>
130 g propylene glycol, boron trifluoride etherate (13.4 mL) in chloroform (500 mL). The<br>
ozonolysis was performed at ambient temperature until indicated to be complete by<br>
passing the effluent gases from the reaction into al% potassium iodide/starch ozone-<br>
indicating solution and refluxing the ozonolysis solution for one hour. The mixture was<br>
stirred with 60 g sodium carbonate for 20 hours and filtered. The resulting solution was<br>
initially evaporated on a rotary evaporator and a short path distillation apparatus (a<br>
Kugelrohr apparatus) was used to vacuum distill the excess propylene glycol at 80°C and<br>
0.25 Torr. The final product is a hybrid ester alcohol with pendent glycerin and propylene<br>
glycol hydroxyl groups with respect to the azelate moiety in the product mixture.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example shows the use of a resin-bound acid to catalyze soybean ozonolysis.<br>
20 g of soybean oil that was pretransesterified with glycerin were reacted with<br>
ozone in the presence of 64 g of glycerin, 34 g of SiliaBond propylsulfonic acid (silica<br><br>
bound acid prepared by Silicycle, Inc.), and 300 mL of acetone. Ozone treatment was<br>
performed at 15-20°C, followed by a 1 hr reflux. The resin bound acid was filtered and<br>
product purified by vacuum distillation. The resulting product composition included about<br>
83% monoglycerides with the balance being diglycerides. The yield was about 88% when<br>
the theoretical yield was based on exclusive formation of monoglycerides.<br>
Example 5<br>
This example shows a procedure for making amide alcohols (amide polyols such<br>
as those in Figure 10 A, B, C, D) starting with methanol-transesterified (modified)<br>
soybean oil (a commercial product called Soyclear" or more generally termed methyl<br>
soyate).<br>
A problem in making the monoalcohol-derived ester intermediates during<br>
ozonolysis of soybean oil with mono-alcohols, such as methanol, in the presence of<br>
catalysts such as boron trifluoride is that oxidation of these intermediate acyclic acetals to<br>
hydrotrioxides to desired esters is very slow. This has been shown by determining the<br>
composition of soybean oil reaction products using various instrumental methods,<br>
including gas chromatography. This slow step is also observed when model aldehydes<br>
were subjected to ozonolysis conditions in the presence of mono-alcohols and boron<br>
trifluoride.<br>
Performing ozonolysis at high temperatures can be used to drive this reaction to<br>
completion, but significant problems arise from oxidation of the alcohol'and ozone loss<br>
due to the long reaction times required. When reactions were performed at low<br>
temperatures, the oxidation reaction proceeded slowly and did not progress to completion.<br>
An alternate method for oxidation was developed that effectively used hydrogen<br>
peroxide to convex t the aldehyde/acetal mixture to the desired carboxylic acid ester.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is possible that (1) the hydrogen peroxide<br>
oxidizes the acetal to an intermediate that rearranges to the ester, or (2) the aldehyde is<br>
oxidized to the carboxylic acid by hydrogen peroxide and the carboxylic acid is then<br>
esterified to the desired ester.<br>
All steps for making amide alcohols were done under a blanket of Argon.<br><br>
The first step in preparing amide alcohols was to prepare the methyl esters of<br>
methanol transesterified soybean oil. Soyclear® (151.50 grams; 0.1714 mole; 0.1714 x 9 =<br>
1.54 mole double bond reactive sites,) was weighed into a 1000 mL 3-neck round bottom<br>
flask. A magnetic stirrer, methanol (500 mL; 12.34 mole), and 6.52 mL 99% sulfuric acid<br>
(0.122 moles) were added to the flask. A thermocouple, sparge tube, and condenser (with<br>
a gas inlet attached to a bubbler containing 1 wt % potassium iodide in 1 wt % starch<br>
solution) were attached to the round bottom flask. The flask was placed in a water bath on<br>
a magnetic stir plate to maintain temperature at 20°C, and ozone was added through the<br>
sparge tube into the mixture for 20 hours (at which time close to the theoretical amount of<br>
ozone required to cleave all double bonds had been added), after which the iodine-starch<br>
solution turned blue. The sparge tube and water bath were removed, a heating mantle was<br>
placed under the flask, and the mixture was refluxed for 1 hour. After reflux, 50 percent<br>
hydrogen peroxide (95 mL) was added to the mixture and then refluxed for 3 hrs (mixture<br>
was refluxed 1 hour longer but to no change was noted). The mixture was then partitioned<br>
with methylene chloride and water. The methylene chloride layer was also washed with<br>
10% sodium bicarbonate and 10%o sodium sulfite (to reduce unreacted hydrogen peroxide)<br>
until the mixture was both neutral and gave no response with peroxide indicating strips.<br>
The solution was then dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The product was<br>
purified by short path distillation to obtain 140.3 g of clear and colorless liquid. This yield<br>
could have been improved by initial distillation of the excess methanol or by continued<br>
extraction of all aqueous layers with methylene chloride.<br>
The second step involved in preparing amide alcohols involved the reaction of the<br>
methyl esters of methanol transesterified soybean oil prepared above with 2-(ethylamino)<br>
ethanol (N-ethylethanolamine). 2-(Ethylamino) ethanol (137.01 g; 1.54 mole) was added<br>
to a round bottom containing the methyl esters of methanol transesterified soybean oil<br>
(135.20 g; 0.116 mole or 1.395 mole total reaction sites), sodium methoxide (15.38 g;<br>
0.285 mole), and methyl alcohol (50 ml). A short path distillation apparatus was attached<br>
and the mixture was heated to 100°C for removal of methanol. The reaction was<br>
monitored by the decrease of the IR ester peak at approximately 1735 cm"l and was<br>
complete after 3 hours.<br><br>
After cooling to room temperature, the oil was dissolved in methanol and stirred<br>
with 500 mL of Amberlite® IR-120 for 1 hour to neutralize the sodium methoxide. The<br>
solutions was filtered and then stirred with 100 mL Amberlyst A-26® resin (hydroxide<br>
form). The mixture was filtered, and the resin was washed thoroughly with methanol.<br>
The bulk solvent was then removed in vacuo on a rotary evaporator, and the resulting oil<br>
was placed on a Kugelrohr system to remove residual excess 2-(ethylamino) ethanol and<br>
solvent at a temperature of 30°C and pressure of 0.04 to 0.2 Torr.<br>
The final weight of the product was 181.85 grams, giving a yield of about 85%.<br>
The hydroxyl value was 351.5. The IR peak at 1620 cm-1 is indicative of an amide<br>
structure. Proton NMR Spectroscopy shows no evidence of triglyceride. NMR peaks at<br>
3.3-3.6 ppm region are indicative of beta-hydroxymethyl amide functionality and are<br>
characteristic of amide hindered rotation consistent with these amide structures.<br>
Amide alcohol or amide polyol products obtained from this general process were<br>
clear and orange colored and had moderate viscosities. Analogous reactions were<br>
performed with the amine alcohol used was diethanolamine, diisopropanolamine, N-<br>
methylethanolamine, and ethanolamine.<br>
Example 6<br>
This example shows a low temperature procedure for making the methyl esters of<br>
methanol transesterified soybean oil.<br>
Soyclear® (10.0 g; 0.01 mole; 0.10 mole double bond reactive sites) was weighed<br>
into a 500 mL 3 neck round bottom flask. A magnetic stirrer, methanol (150 mL),<br>
methylene chloride (150 mL), and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (3.25 mL; 0.03 mole)<br>
were added to the flask. A thermometer, sparge tube, and condenser (with a gas inlet<br>
attached to a bubbler containing 1 wt % potassium iodide in 1 wt % starch solution) were<br>
attached to the round bottom flask. The flask was placed into a dry ice acetone bath on a<br>
magnetic stir plate to maintain temperature at -68°C. Ozone was added through a sparge<br>
tube into the mixture for 1 hour in which the solution had turned blue in color. The sparge<br>
- tube and bath was then removed, and the solution allowed to warm to room temperature.<br>
Once at room temperature, a sample was taken showing that all double bonds had been<br>
consumed. At this point, 50 percent hydrogen peroxide (10 mL) was added to solution, a<br><br>
heating mantle was placed under the flask, and the mixture was refluxed for 2 hours.<br>
Sampling revealed the desired products. The mixture was then treated by methylene<br>
chloride-water partitioning in which the methylene chloride was washed with 10% sodium<br>
bicarbonate and 10% sodium sulfite (to reduce unreacted hydrogen peroxide) until the<br>
mixture was both neutral and gave no response with peroxide indicating strips. The<br>
solution was then dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The product was purified by<br>
short path distillation giving moderate yields.<br>
Example 7<br>
This example shows a procedure for making the methyl esters of methanol<br>
transesterified soybean oil (shown in Figure 4).<br>
Soybean oil (128.0 g; 0.15 mole; 1.74 mole double bond reactive sites plus<br>
triglyceride reactive sites) was weighed into a 500 mL 3 neck round bottom flask. A<br>
magnetic stirrer, methanol (266 mL), and 99 percent sulfuric acid (3.0 mL; 0.06 mole)<br>
were added to the flask. A thermocouple and condenser were attached to the round<br>
bottom flask. A heating mantle and stir plate was placed under the flask and the mixture<br>
was refluxed for 3 hours (in which the heterogeneous mixture becomes homogeneous.<br>
The heating mantle was then replaced with a water bath to maintain temperature around<br>
20°C. A sparge tube was attached to the flask and a gas inlet with a bubbler containing 1<br>
wt % potassium iodide in 1 wt % starch solution was attached to the condenser. Ozone<br>
was added through a sparge tube into the mixture for 14 hours. The water bath was then<br>
replaced with a heating mantle, and the temperature was raised to 45°C. Ozone was<br>
stopped after 7 hours, and the solution was refluxed for 5 hours. Ozone was then restarted<br>
and sparged into the mixture for 13 hours longer at 45°C. The mixture was then refluxed 2<br>
hours longer. Sampling showed 99.3% complete reaction. The mixture was then treated<br>
by methylene chloride-water partitioning in which the methylene chloride was washed<br>
with 10%o sodium bicarbonate and 5%o sodium sulfite (to reduce unreacted hydrogen<br>
peroxide) until the mixture was both neutral and gave no response with peroxide<br>
indicating strips. The solution was then dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The<br>
product was purified by short path distillation to obtain 146.3 g of clear and light yellow<br><br>
liquid. Initial distillation of the methanol or continued extraction of all aqueous layers<br>
with methylene chloride could have improved this yield.<br>
Example 8<br>
This example illustrates amidification fatty acid-cleaved methyl esters without the<br>
use of catalyst.<br>
The methyl esters of methanol transesterified soybean oil (20.0g; the product of<br>
ozonolysis of methyl soyate in methanol described in the first step of Example 5) were<br>
added to 25.64 g (2 equivalents) of ethanolamine and 5 mL methanol. The mixture was<br>
heated to 120°C in a flask attached to a short path distillation apparatus overnight at<br>
ambient pressure. Thus, the reaction time was somewhat less than 16 hrs. The reaction<br>
was shown to be complete by loss of the ester peak at 1730 cm-1 in its infrared spectra.<br>
Excess ethanolamine was removed by vacuum distillation.<br>
Example 9<br>
This example shows the amidification of fatty acids at the triglyceride backbone<br>
sites as shown in Figure 7.<br>
. Backbone amidification of esters can be performed not only using Lewis acids and<br>
Bronsted acids, but also using bases such as sodium methoxide.<br>
100.0 g of soybean oil was reacted with 286.0 g of diethanolamine (2 equivalents)<br>
dissolved in 200 ml methanol, using 10.50 g of sodium methoxide as a catalyst. The<br>
reaction was complete after heating the reaction mixture at 100°C for three hours during<br>
which methanol was collected by short path distillation. The reaction mixture was<br>
purified by ethyl acetate/water partitioning to produce the desired product in about 98%<br>
yield. Proton NMR spectroscopy indicated a purity of about 98% purity with the balance<br>
being methyl esters.<br>
This reaction can also be performed neat, but the use of methanol enhances<br><br>
solubility and reduces reaction times.<br>
The reaction can be performed catalyst free, but slower, with a wide range of<br>
amines. See Example 8.<br><br>
Example 10<br>
This example shows the use of fatty acids amidified at the triglyceride backbone<br>
(soy amides) to produce hybrid soy amide/ester materials such as those shown in Figure<br>
11.<br>
Soy amides (fatty acids amidified at the triglyceride backbone as described in<br>
Example 9) can be converted to an array of amide/ester hybrids with respect in the azelate<br>
component. Soybean oil diethanolamide (200.0 g; from Example 9) was ozonized for 26<br>
hours at 15-25°C in the presence of 500 g of propylene glycol using 1 liter of chloroform<br>
as solvent and 51.65 mL of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate. After ozone treatment, the<br>
solution was refluxed for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was neutralized by stirring the<br>
mixture for 3 hours with 166.5 g of sodium carbonate in 300 mL water. These solutions<br>
were placed into a 6 liter separatory funnel containing 1350 mL water. The chloroform<br>
layer was removed and the water layer was re-extracted with 1325 mL of ethyl acetate.<br>
The ethyl acetate and chloroform layers were combined, dried with magnesium.sulfate,<br>
and then filtered. Solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator and the placed on a<br>
Kugelrohr short path distillation apparatus for 2.5 hours at 30°C at 0.17 Torr. This process<br>
yielded 289.25 g of material which constitutes a 81% yield. The hydroxyl value obtained<br>
on the material was 343.6.<br>
To illustrate the chemical structure of this mixture, only the resulting azelate<br>
component (the major component) would have diethanolamide functionality on one end<br>
and the ester of propylene glycol on the other end. (This product could then be further<br>
amidified with a different amide to create a hybrid amide system such as the one in Figure<br>
10 E).<br>
Example 11<br>
This example shows the amidification of soybean oil derivatives to increase<br>
hydroxyl value.<br>
Amidification can be applied to oil derivatives, such as hydroformylated soybean<br>
oil and hydrogenated epoxidized soybean oil, to increase the hydroxyl value and<br>
reactivity.<br><br>
Hydrogenated epoxidized soybean oil (257.0 g) was amidified with 131 g of<br>
diethanolamine with 6.55 g of sodium methoxide and 280 mL methanol using the<br>
amidification and purification process described for the amidification of esters in Example<br>
9. The product was purified by ethyl acetate/water partitioning. When diethanolamine<br>
was used, the yield was 91% and the product had a theoretical hydroxyl value of 498.<br>
This product has both primary hydroxyl groups (from the diethanolamide<br>
structure) and secondary hydroxyl groups along the fatty acid chain.<br>
Example 12<br>
This example shows the transesterification of soybean oil mono-alcohol esters<br>
(ethyl and methyl esters) with glycerin to form primarily soybean oil monoglycerides<br>
(illustrated in Figure 6).<br>
8 g of soy ethyl esters (product of ozonolysis and reflux of soybean oil in ethanol<br>
with individual structures analogous to those shown in Figure 4) were added to 30.0 g of<br>
glycerin, ethanol (30 mL), and 99% sulfuric acid (0.34 mL). The mixture was heated to<br>
120°C in a short path distillation apparatus for 6.5 hours. The reaction was analyzed using<br>
NMR spectroscopy which showed about 54% glyceride product and balance being ethyl<br>
ester starting material. Boron trifuoride diethyl etherate (0.1 mL) was added, and the<br>
solution was heated to 120°C for 5 hours. The reaction was analyzed by NMR<br>
spectroscopy which indicated the presence of about 72% total glyceride product with the<br>
balance being the ethyl ester starting material.<br>
In another experiment, 30.0 g soy methyl esters (product of ozonolysis and reflux<br>
soybean oil in methanol using sulfuric acid as catalyst as illustrated in Figure 4) were<br>
added to 96.8 g. glycerin, methanol (50 mL), and 7.15 g of sodium methoxide (shown in<br>
Figure 6). The mixture was heated to 100°C for 15.5 hours in a short path distillation<br>
apparatus, and the temperature was raised to 130°C for 2 hr. with vacuum being applied<br>
for the final 2 minutes of heating. The reaction was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy<br>
which showed 55% total glyceride product with the balance being methyl ester starting<br>
materials.<br><br>
Coatings<br>
Polyurethane and polyester coatings can be made using the ester alcohols, ester<br>
polyols, amide alcohols, and amide polyols of the present invention and reacting them<br>
with polyisocyanates, polyacids, or polyesters.<br>
A number of coatings with various polyols using specific di- and triisocyanates, and<br>
mixtures thereof were prepared. These coatings have been tested with respect to flexibility<br>
(conical mandrel bend), chemical resistance (double MEK rubs), adhesion (cross-hatch<br>
adhesion), impact resistance (direct and indirect impact with 80 lb weight), hardness (measured<br>
by the pencil hardness scale) and gloss (measured with a specular gloss meter set at 60°). The<br>
following structures are just the azealate component of select ester, amide, and ester/amide<br>
hybrid alcohols, with their corresponding hydroxyl functionality, that were prepared and tested.<br><br>
The following commercial isocyanates (with commercial names, abbreviations and<br>
isocyanate functionality) were used in the coatings work: diphenylmethane 4,4'-diisocyanate<br>
(MDI, difunctional); Isonate 143L (MDI modified with a carbodiimide, trifunctional at 
and difunctional at &gt; 90°C); Isobond 1088 (a polymeric MDI derivative); Bayhydur 302 (Bayh.<br><br>
302, a trimer of hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate, trifunctional); and 2,4-toluenediisocyanate<br>
(TDI, difunctional).<br>
Coatings were initially cured at 120°C for 20 minutes using 0.5% dibutyltin dilaurate,<br>
but it became evident that curing at 163°C for 20 minutes gave higher performance coatings so<br>
curing at the higher temperature was adopted. A minimum pencil hardness needed for general-<br>
use coatings is HB and a hardness of 2H is sufficiently hard to be used in many applications<br>
where high hardness is required. High gloss is valued in coatings and 60° gloss readings of 90-<br>
100° are considered to be "very good" and 60° gloss readings approaching 100° match those<br>
required for "Class A" finishes.<br>
Example 13<br>
Coatings from Partially Acetate-Capped (And Non-Capped) Soybean Oil Monoglycerides<br>
Polyurethane coatings were prepared from three different partially acetate-capped<br>
samples having different hydroxyl values as specified in Table 1 and numerous<br>
combinations of isocyanates were examined.<br>
When using polyol batch 51056-66-28, most coatings were prepared from mixtures<br>
of Bayhydur 302 and MDI and it was determined that quite good coatings were obtained<br>
when underindexing with these isocyanate mixtures compositions (0.68-0.75 indexing).<br>
Two of the best coatings were obtained at a 90:10 ratio of Bayhydur 302:MDI where<br>
pencil hardness values of F and H were obtained (formulas 12-2105-4 and 12-2105-3). A<br>
very good coating was also obtained when 51056-66-28 was reacted with a 50:50 ratio of<br>
Bayhydur 302:MDI. The fact that these good coatings could be obtained when isocyanate<br>
was under indexed by about 25% could result from the fact that when the approximately<br>
trifunctional polyol reacts with isocyanates with &gt;2 functionality, a sufficiently<br>
crosslinked structure is established to provide good coating properties while leaving some<br>
of the polyol functionality unreacted.<br>
Polyol batch 51056-6-26, which has a somewhat lower hydroxyl value than 51056-<br>
66-28, was mainly reacted with mixtures of Bayhydur 302, Isobond 1088, and Isonate<br>
143L with isocyanate indexing of 0.9-1.0. As can be seen, some very good coatings were<br>
obtained, with formulas 2-0206-3 and 2-2606-1 (10:90 ratio of Bayhydur 302:Isobond<br>
1088) being two of the best coatings obtained.<br>
i<br><br>
A sample of polyol 51056-6-26 was formulated with a 2:1 mixture of TDI and<br>
Bayhydur 302 with no solvent and the viscosity was such that this mixture was applied<br>
well to surfaces with an ordinary siphon air gun without requiring any organic solvent.<br>
This coating cured well while passing all performance tests and had a 60° gloss of 97°.<br>
Such polyol/isocyanate formulations not containing any VOGs could be important because<br>
formulation of such mixtures for spray coatings without using organic solvents is of high<br>
value but difficult to achieve.<br>
Polyol batch 51056-51-19 had an appreciably lower hydroxyl value than those of<br>
polyol batches 51056-66-28 or 51056-6-26 due to a different work-up procedure. This<br>
polyol was reacted mainly with mixtures of Bayhydur 302 and MDI. Formulas 2-2606-7<br>
(90:10 Bayhydur 302:MDI and indexed at 1.0) gave an inferior coating in terms of<br>
hardness compared to that of polyol 51056-66-28 when reacted with the same, but<br>
underindexed, isocyanate composition (formula 12-2105-4).<br>
One coating was obtained using non-capped soybean oil monoglycerides (51290-<br>
11-32) that had a hydroxyl value of approximately 585. This coating was prepared by<br>
reaction with a 50:50 ratio of Bayhydur 302:MDI (formula 3-0106-1) using approximately<br>
1.0 indexing and had a 2H pencil hardness and a 60° gloss of 99°. This coating was rated<br>
as one of the best overall coatings prepared.<br>
Example 14<br>
Coatings from Soybean Oil Propylene Glycol Esters<br>
Preparation and performance data of soybean oil propylene glycol esters are shown<br>
in Table 2. Significantly fewer isocyanate compositions were evaluated compared to the<br>
soybean oil monoglycerides described in Table 1. The isocyanate compositions that were<br>
evaluated with these propylene glycol esters did not correspond to the best compositions<br>
evaluated with the glycerides since the favorable data in Table 1 was obtained after the<br>
tests with soybean oil propylene glycol esters were initiated.<br>
Coating formula 1-2306-5 was one of the best performing propylene glycol<br>
ester/isocyanate compositions that employed a 90:10 ratio of Isobond 1088:Bayhydur 302,<br>
with an isocyanate indexing of 1.39. The one test area requiring improvement was that its<br>
pencil hardness was only HB. This isocyanate composition is the same as the two high-<br>
i<br><br>
performing glyceride coatings, formulas 2-2606-1 and 2-2606-3 but these had isocyanate<br>
indexing values of 1.0 and 0.90, respectively. The fact that these glyceride-containing<br>
coatings had better performance properties is probably due to this indexing difference.<br>
Coating formula 1-2306-4 was another relatively high performing coating derived from<br>
propylene glycol that was also derived from Isobond 1088 and Bayhydur 302 (with an<br>
isocyanate indexing of 1.39) but its pencil hardness was also HB.<br>
Example 15<br>
Soybean Oil-Derived Coatings Containing Hydroxyethylamide Components<br>
Preparation and performance data of this class of polyurethane derivatives is<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
Soybean Oil Diethanolamide (Backbone)-Propylene Glycol Esters<br>
100% Bayhydur 302 gave a better coating in terms of hardness with polyol 51056-<br>
95-28 when the isocyanate indexing was 1.00 compared to 0.44 (formulas 2-2606-3<br>
compared to 1-2606-1). Using 100% Isonate 143L and Isobond 1088 with isocyanate<br>
indexing of 1.00 gave inferior coatings compared to use of Bayhydur 302.<br>
A polyurethane composition was also prepared with polyol 51056-95-28 using a 2:1<br>
composition of 2,4-TDI:Bayhydur 302 and 10% of a highly branched polyester was added<br>
as a "hardening" agent. This coating passed all performance tests and had a pencil<br>
hardness of 5H and a 60° gloss of 115°. These results strongly indicate that use of very<br>
small quantities of such hardening agents will significantly enhance the performance of<br>
polyurethane coatings not only prepared from these hydroxyethylamide-containing<br>
coatings but also the glyceride-based and propylene glycol-based coatings as well.<br>
Soybean Oil N-Methylethanolamide (Backbone)-Propylene Glycol Esters<br>
The use of 50:50 Bayhydur 302:MDI with isocyanate indexing of only 0.57 gave good<br>
coating results with an exceptional 60° gloss of 101° but the coating pencil hardness was<br>
only HB.<br><br>
Soybean Oil Fully Amidified with N-Methylethanolamine<br>
The use of 100% Isonate 143L with an isocyanate indexing of 0.73 gave a coating<br>
that tested well except it had poor chemical resistance (based on MEK rubs) and only had<br>
a pencil hardness of HB.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Polyurethane foams can be made using the ester alcohols, ester polyols, amide<br>
alcohols, and amide polyols of the present invention and reacting them with polyisocyanates.<br>
The preparation methods of the present invention allow a range of hydroxyl<br>
functionalities that will allow the products to fit various applications. For example,<br>
higher functionality gives more rigid foams (more crosslinking), and lower functionality<br>
gives more flexible foams (less crosslinking).<br>
While the forms of the invention herein disclosed constitute presently preferred<br>
embodiments, many others are possible. It is not intended herein to mention all of the<br>
possible equivalent forms or ramifications of the invention. It is to be understood that the<br>
