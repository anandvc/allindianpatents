				<td>Azaheterocvclyl derivatives of androstanes and androstenes as me-<br>
dicaments for cardiovascular disorders<br>
The present invention relates to new azaheterocyclyl derivatives at po-<br>
sition 3 of 5- and/or 6- and/or 7-substituted androstanes and androste-<br>
nes, processes for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, such as<br>
heart failure and hypertension.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cardiovascular diseases are still the first cause of morbidity and mor-<br>
tality in the western world; among these, hypertension and heart fail-<br>
ure are two frequent diseases. Hypertension is one of the most impor-<br>
tant cardiovascular risk factor and more than one third of population<br>
over 60 suffers from this disease. Congestive heart failure affects l-2%<br>
of the population and even 10% of the very elderly; the percentage is<br>
expected to rise (Sharpe, N. et al., The Lancet, 1998, 352 (suppl. 1), 3-<br>
17). Beside, hypertension may be one of more important causes of heart<br>
failure in the elderly (Eur. Heart J., 2001, 22, 1527-1560).<br>
Although a number of effective drugs are available for the treatment of<br>
both hypertension and heart failure, further research is in progress to<br>
find more effective and safe compounds.<br>
Several drugs are used in combination for the treatment of heart fail-<br>
ure, and among positive inotropic agents, digoxin is the most pre-<br>
scribed digitalis cardiac glycoside that can improve the myocardial per-<br>
formance. A very well-known drawback of digitalis drugs is their ar-<br>
rhythmogenic side-effect. Evidence of digitalis toxicity emerges at two-<br>
to three-fold higher serum concentration than the therapeutic dose,<br>
such as disturbances of conduction and cardiac arrhythmias which are<br>
characteristics of digitalis toxicity (Hoffman, B. F.; Bigger, J. T. Digi-<br>
talis and Allied Cardiac Glycosides. In The Pharmacological Basis of<br><br>
Therapeutics, 8th ed.; Goodman Gilman, A.; Nies, A. S.; Rail, T. W.;<br>
Taylor, P., Eds.; Pergamon Press, New York, 1990, pp 814-839).<br>
The capability of the natural digitalis compounds to increase the myo-<br>
cardial force of contraction is strictly related to their cardenolide struc-<br>
ture having a 17β-lactone on a 14-hydroxy-5β, 14β-androstane skeleton.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the field of steroidal derivatives some groups of compounds are re-<br>
ported to possess positive inotropic properties or other activities re-<br>
lated to the cardiovascular system.<br>
Particularly, within pregnane derivatives the following papers are in-<br>
teresting.<br>
GB 868,303 discloses pregnane-20-one derivatives possessing progesta-<br>
tional and antifibrillatory action.<br>
Other aminoalkylesters of 3β hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one derivatives<br>
are disclosed by GB 966,060. with anorectic, antiarrhythmic and antia-<br>
therogenic activities, and US 3.013,009, with eurithmic, anticonvul-<br>
sant, and antihypertensive activities.<br>
US 5,144,017 discloses "compounds that bind to the digitalis receptor"<br>
including androstane and pregnane derivatives. According to the in-<br>
ventors, the binding to the digitalis receptor parallels the ability to<br>
elicit characteristic cellular response. The inventors focus on the capa-<br>
bility of the different classes of steroids of yielding glycosides deriva-<br>
tives with typical digoxin-like actions on the heart as well as on other<br>
tissues, which seems to be important improve the toxicity of these<br>
compounds. Even though some androstane derivatives are reported,<br>
the more interesting compounds are 3-glycosides of pregnane deriva-<br>
tives.<br><br>
Pregnane guanyhydrazones with positive inotropic cardiac effect are<br>
reported by S. Schiitz, et al., Arzneimitlel-Forschung, 1969, 19, 69-75.<br>
Particularly relevant to the activity of these compounds is the guanyl-<br>
hydrazone substituent, since "replacement of the guanyl hydrazone<br>
groups by other related residues results in a loss of activity".<br>
Other pregnene-20-one derivatives, such as clormadinone acetate and<br>
megestrol acetate are reported to inhibit the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase<br>
but they were not "capable of eliciting an inotropic action by them-<br>
selves" (K. Temma, et al, Research. Comm. Chem. in Pathology and<br>
Pharmacology, 1983, 41, 51-63).<br>
In the field of 5α, 14α-androstane derivatives some groups of com-<br>
pounds are reported to possess positive inotropic properties..<br>
GB 1,175.219 and US 3,580,905 disclose 3-(aminoalkoxycarbonylalkyle-<br>
ne)steroid derivatives which possess digitalis like activities with a ratio<br>
between the dose which produces toxic symptoms (onset of cardiac ar-<br>
rhythmias) and the effective dose comparable with such a ratio as<br>
measured for standard cardiac glycosides. Besides no clear advantage<br>
over digitalis glycosides, the compounds with the highest ratio produce<br>
the lowest increase in contractile force.<br>
6-Hydroxy and 6-oxoandrostane derivatives are disclosed in EP 0 825<br>
197 as ligands and inhibitors of Na+,K+-ATPase, and positive inotropic<br>
agents, possessing a lower toxicity when compared with digoxin, as<br>
evaluated on the basis of the acute toxicity in mice. The same com-<br>
pounds are also reported by S. De Munari, et ah, J. Med. Chem. 2003,<br>
64, 3644-3654.<br>
The evidence that high levels of endogenous ouabain (EO), a closely re-<br>
lated isomer of ouabain, are implicated in human hypertension and<br>
cardiac hypertrophy and failure stimulated the pharmacological re-<br>
search for developing novel anti-hypertensive agents active as ouabain<br>
antagonists. The pathogenetic mechanisms through which increased<br><br>
EO levels affect cardiovascular system involve the modulation of Na-K<br>
ATPase, the key enzyme responsible for renal tubular sodium reab-<br>
sorption and the activation of signalling transduction pathways impli-<br>
cated in growth-related gene transcription. By studying both genetic<br>
and experimental rat models of hypertension and comparing them with<br>
humans, it has been demonstrated that elevated levels of circulating<br>
EO and the genetic polymorphism of the cytoskeletal protein adducin<br>
associate with hypertension and high renal Na-K pump activity. Oua<br>
bain itself induces hypertension and up-regulates renal Na-K pump<br>
when chronically infused at low doses into rats (OS). In renal cultured<br>
cells, either incubated for several days with nanomolar concentrations<br>
of ouabain or transfected with the hypertensive adducin genetic vari-<br>
ant, the Na-K pump results enhanced. Moreover, both EO and adducin<br>
polymorphism affect cardiac complications associated to hypertension,<br>
the former through the activation of a signalling transduction path-<br>
wax-. As a consequence, a compound able to interact with the cellular<br>
and molecular alterations, sustained by EO or mutated adducin, may<br>
represent the suitable treatment for those patients in whom these<br>
mechanisms are at work (Ferrandi M.. et al., Curr Pharm Des.<br>
2005;ll(25):3301-5).<br>
As reported above, the crucial point of positive inotropic agents is the<br>
ability to discriminate between the potency in inducing an increase of<br>
myocardial force of contraction and the onset of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
There is still a constant need to make available drugs showing a better<br>
therapeutic ratio and/or a longer duration of action, both of them im-<br>
portant factors for the compliance of patients. Preferably, the drugs<br>
can be administered by the oral route.<br>
Dehydroepiandrosterone 3β-aminoethers or aminoesters substituted in<br>
position 7 with a keto or optionally substituted alkoxy groups are dis-<br>
closed in US 2003/0054021 and WO 03/035023 A1 for the cosmetical or<br>
therapeutical treatments of cutaneous disorders related to keratinous<br>
afflictions.<br><br>
3-Dialkylaminoethers and 3-dialkylaminothioethers of 3β-hydroxy-6α-<br>
methylandrostanes or of 3β-hydroxy-6-methyl-5-androstenes are dis-<br>
closed in US 3,210,386 as hypocholesterolemic and antiparasitic<br>
agents.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that 3-azaheterocyclyl derivatives of 5 and/or 6-<br>
and/or 7-substituted androstanes and androstenes meet the needs of to<br>
provide drugs with a better therapeutic ratio and/or longer duration of<br>
action.<br>

G. M. Wuts "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", J. Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
Inc., 3rd Ed., 1999) and well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
All said transformations are only examples of well established proce-<br>
dures described in organic chemistry (see for example: J. March "Ad-<br>

The compounds of formula (I) as defined above are useful agents for the<br>
treatment of cardiovascular disorders, such as heart failure and hyper-<br>
tension. Moreover said compounds show affinity and inhibit the enzy-<br>
matic activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase.<br><br>
Since the compounds of the present invention are shown to be able to<br>
antagonize the molecular effects induced by nanomolar ouabain con-<br>
centrations on the Na-KATPase, they will be effective the treatment of<br>
the diseases caused by the hypertensive effects of endogenous ouabain.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the the diseases<br>
caused by the hypertensive effects of endogenous ouabain include: re-<br>
nal failure progression in autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease<br>
(ADPKD), preeclamptic hypertension and proteinuria and renal failure<br>
progression in patients with adducin polymorphisms.<br>
In autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease (ADPKD), cyst forma-<br>
tion and enlargement are due to cell proliferation and transepithelial<br>
secretion of fluids, causing progressive impairment renal function and<br>
kidney failure. 1 over 1000 subjects are affected by ADPKD which<br>
represents the first genetic cause of renal failure. Renal Na-K ATPase<br>
is essential for ion and fluid transport in ADPKD cells and its misloca-<br>
tion and function alteration have been described in this pathology (Wil-<br>
son PD et al. Am J Pathol 2000; 156:253-268). Ouabain, the inhibitor of<br>
the Na-KATPase. inhibits fluid secretion in ADPKD cysts (Grantham<br>
JJ et al. I Clin. Invest. 1995; 95:195-202) at micromolar concentrations,<br>
conversely, at nanomolar concentrations, which are similar to the circu-<br>
lating endogenous ouabain ones, ouabain stimulates ADPKD cell pro-<br>
liferation but does not affect normal human kidney cell growth<br>
(Nguyen AN et al. 2007; 18:46-57) . It. has been demonstrated that oua-<br>
bain stimulates ADPKD proliferation by binding to the Na-KATPase<br>
with high affinity and triggering the activation of the MEK-ERK path-<br>
way (Nguyen AN et al. 2007; 18:46-57).<br>
Preeclampsia is a potential devastating disorder of hypertension in<br>
pregnancy for which an effective treatment is still lacking. Elevated<br>
circulating levels of cardenolides and bufodienolides have been re-<br>
ported in preeclamptic patients and in rat models of the disease (Lo-<br>
patin DA et al J. Hypertens. 1999;17:1179-1187; Graves SV et al. Am<br>
J Hypertens. 1995; 8:5-11: Adair CD et al. Am J Nephrol. 1996; 16:529-<br><br>
531). The data available suggest that in preeclampsia elevated plasma<br>
concentrations of Na-K ATPase inhibitors lead to vasoconstriction and<br>
malignant hypertension (Vu HV et al. Am J Nephrol. 2005; 25:520-<br>
528). Recently, Digoxin-specific Fab (Digibind) have been proved to re-<br>
duce blood pressure and increase natriuresis in preeclamptic patients<br>
(Pullen MA al.JPET 2004; 310:319-325).<br>
Glomerulosclerosis-associated proteinuria is due to an impairment of<br>
the slit-pore structure formed by the podocyte foot-processes in the<br>
glomerulus. In particular, slit diaphragm proteins such as nephrin,<br>
ZO1, podocyn, synaptopodin and others, in addition to their structural<br>
functions participate in common signaling pathways regulated by Fyn<br>
a tyrosin kinase of the Src family kinases ( Benzing T. J Am Soc<br>
Nephrol 2004; 15:1382-1391). Recently, a key role in the structure of<br>
the slit pore has been ascribed to beta adducin, a cytoskeletal protein<br>
under the control of Fyn (Gotnh H BBRC 2006; 346:600-605; Shima T<br>
et al. JBC 2001; 276: 42233-42240). Adducin polymorphisms joint to<br>
that of ACE have been found associated to impaired renal function in<br>
European and Chinese populations (Wang JG et al. J Mol Med 2004;<br>
82:715-722; Wang JG et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001; 38: 1158-1168). Ro-<br>
stafuroxin and analogues, as endogenous ouabain antagonists, have<br>
been described to be able to antagonize the molecular effect of adducin<br>
polymorphism on tyrosin kinase signaling (Ferrandi M. et al.<br>
JBC.2004; 279:33306-14; Ferrari et al.Am J Physiol Regul 2006;<br>
290:R529-535; Ferrari P. et al. Med Hypothes. 2007; 68:1307-1314).<br>
Moreover the compounds of the invention possess positive inotropic<br>
features, as shown by slow intravenous infusion in anesthetized guinea<br>
pig according to Cerri (Cerri A. et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 2332)<br>
and have a low toxicity when compared with standard cardiotonic ster-<br>
oids, e.g. digoxin.<br>

Biological Results<br>
To test the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase,<br>
the Na+,K+-ATPase was purified according to Jorghensen (Jorghensen<br>
P., BBA, 1974, 356, 36) and Erdmann (Erdmann E. et al.,<br>
Arzneim.Forsh., 1984, 34, 1314) and the inhibition was measured as %<br>
of hydrolysis of 32P-ATP in presence and in absence of the tested com-<br>
pound (Mall F. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1984, 33, 47; see Table 1).<br><br><br><br><br>
Moreover the compounds of the invention possess positive inotropic<br>
features, as shown by slow intravenous infusion in anesthetized guinea<br>
pig according to Cerri (Cerri A. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 2332)<br>
and have a low toxicity, i.e. a better therapeutic ratio, when compared<br>
with standard cardiotonic steroids, e.g. digoxin.<br>
The compounds of the present invention show a higher efficacy and/or<br>
a better therapeutic ratio and/or a longer duration of action compared<br>
to compound 22b ((EZ) 3-(2-aminoethoxyimino)androstane-6,17-dione<br>
hydrochloride) reported by S. De Munari et al. in J. Med. Chem. 2003,<br>
64, 3644-3654.<br>
The activity of some compounds of general formula (I) on the above<br>
mentioned tests was determined and the results are shown in the fol-<br>
lowing Table 2. The inotropic activity is shown as maximum increase<br>
in contractile force (Emax measured as +dP/dTmax), dose inducing<br>
maximum positive inotropic effect (EDmax), inotropic potency (ED80,<br>
dose increasing +dP/dTmax by 80%); the toxicity, as the ratio between<br>
lethal dose and inotropic potency, or safety ratio, (calculated for the<br>
died animals); the maximum dose infused in the survived animals; the<br>
duration of the inotropic effect as the decrease of the effect from the<br>
EDmax measured 20 minutes after the end of the infusion.<br><br><br>
As reported in Table 2, the compounds showed positive inotropic effects<br>
with higher safety ratios than those displayed by digoxin and compd<br>
22b. In fact the safety ratios (lethal dose/ED80 ratios) were either<br>
higher or even not determinable, when no animals died; noteworthy,<br>
for some compounds a lower percentage of animals died in comparison<br>
to digoxin and compd 22b. Further, some compounds showed prolonged<br>
action as shown by the persistence of the inotropic effect after stopping<br>
the infusion (% decrease from Emax after 20 min from the end of the in-<br>
fusion). When no animal died, higher doses were not tested since the<br>
maximum increases in contractile force were comparable or higher to<br>
those displayed by digoxin and compd 22b.<br><br>
Further data on longer duration of action of the compounds of the pre-<br>
sent invention were generated and these are shown in Table 3, where<br>
the results of the metabolism of the compounds in fresh rat hepatocytes<br>
(from Sprague Dawley, males, weights in the range 285-295 grams; vi-<br>
ability 80-90%; concentration: 2590000-3084000 hepatocytes/ml; test<br>
item nominal concentration: 45µM) are reported in comparison with<br>
compd 22b which is almost completely metabolized within 60 minutes.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention possess also antihypertensive<br>
activity, as taught, by P. Ferrari et al., in Cardiovascular Drug Reviews,<br>
1999, 17, 39-57, who demonstrated that compounds affecting Na+,K+-<br>
ATPase can lower blood pressure in models of hypertension.<br>
The ability of these compounds to lower blood pressure was tested by<br>
using an animal model with induced hypertension, in particular, rats<br>
made hypertensive by chronic infusion of ouabain, according to Ferrari<br>
P., et al. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998, 285, 83-94.<br>
The procedure adopted to test the antihypertensive activity of the com-<br>
pounds on the above mentioned model was the following: systolic blood<br>
pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by an indirect taII-<br>
cuff method. The blood pressure lowering effect was measured in hy-<br><br>
pertensive ouabairrsensitive rats. The compound, suspended in Metho-<br>
cel 0.5% (w/v), was administered daily at the dose of 10 µg/kg/day by<br>
mouth for four weeks. SBP and HR were measured weekly 6 hours af-<br>
ter the treatment. The comparison are ouabain sensitive rats (OS rats)<br>
and non hypertensive rats (control), both treated only with Methocel<br>
0.5% (w/v). As shown in the following Table 4, treatment with a com-<br>
pound of the present invention lowers the blood pressure of OS rats<br>
(170 mm Hg) to almost the level of control rats (150 mm Hg).<br><br><br>
