TRANSFER RESISTANT COSMETIC STICK COMPOSITIONS<br>
WITH SEMI-MATTE FINISH<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention is in the field of cosmetic compositions for application to skin and lips.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cosmetic compositions are generally defined as compositions suitable for application to the human body. Pigmented cosmetic compositions such as makeup, blush, lipstick, and eyeshadow are used to color the skin and lips, or to moisturize, hide wrinkles, and the like.  Since color is one of the most important reasons for wearing cosmetics, color containing cosmetics must be very carefully formulated to provide maximum wear and effect.<br>
One of the long standing problems with makeups such as face makeup, lipstick, mascara, and the like, is the tendency of the cosmetic to blot or transfer from the skin or lashes onto other surfaces such as glassware, silverware, skin, or clothing.  This not only creates soiling, but forces the cosmetic user to reapply the cosmetic at fairly short intervals.<br>
Cosmetic compositions with improved transfer resistance are disclosed in a previous patent application entitled "Cosmetic Compositions With Improved Transfer Resistance", filed by Applicants' assignee as U.S. Serial No. 990,716 on December 15, 1992, which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, these transfer resistant cosmetic compositions can have a matte texture on the skin and lips.<br>
However, some women prefer lipsticks that have a slightly glossy finish (referred to as semi-matte).  In general, the ingredients that can be added to matte transfer resistant lipsticks to enhance gloss and provide a semi-matte finish have a tendency to compromise transfer resistance.<br>
It has been unexpectedly discovered that cosmetic compositions containing the combination of a volatile solvent<br><br>
with a polymeric organosiloxane emulsifier that is miscible or soluble in the volatile solvent and has a lipophilic portion and a hydrophilic portion provides cosmetic compositions that have excellent transfer resistance, as well as providing a semi-matte finish when applied to skin.<br>
An object of this invention is to formulate cosmetic compositions, particularly lipsticks, with long lasting adherence to skin that provides a semi-matte finish when applied to skin.<br>
Another object of this invention is to formulate a transfer resistant cosmetic composition that provides a semi-matte finish, that, once applied to skin, resists transfer to glass, clothing, other skin, or utensils.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The invention is directed to a transfer resistant anhydrous cosmetic stick composition comprising, by weight of the total composition:<br>
a)	10-70% of a volatile solvent having a viscosity of 0.5 to 25 centistokes at 25° C., and<br>
b)	0.1-40% of a polymeric organosiloxane emulsifier containing at least one hydrophilic radical or portion, and at least one lipophilic radical or portion.<br>
The invention is also directed to a method for providing a cosmetic stick composition with transfer resistance and a semi-matte finish when applied to skin, comprising adding to said composition the combination of a volatile solvent and a polymeric organosiloxane emulsifier that has at least one lipophilic radical or portion and at least one hydrophilic radical or portion.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The term "stick" refers to cosmetic compositions having a consistency such that they can be molded into the form of a stick — for instance by being heated until molten and then poured into a mold and cooled.  Also included within the definition of "stick" are anhydrous compositions of the<br><br>
invention that are capable of being formed into sticks, but are poured into pans or other types of cake or cream forms to deliver certain consumer benefits.  For example, an eyeshadow composition in accordance with the invention may be molded in the stick form, but it may be desired to pour it into a pan because this container is more desireable from a consumer standpoint.<br>
The term "anhydrous" means that the composition contains no more than about 5 percent, more particularly about 1 to 2 percent by weight or less of water, or more preferably, that water is not intentionally added to the cosmetic composition of the invention.<br>
THE VOLATILE SOLVENT<br>
The volatile solvent component of the composition is a liquid, and enables easy formulation of the cosmetic stick of the invention.  When the cosmetic stick product of the invention is applied to skin or lips, the volatile solvent of the invention must be capable of flashing off to leave the other ingredients in the stick on the skin.  The composition of the invention comprises 10-70%, preferably 20-65%, and most preferably 25-60% of a volatile solvent.  The volatile solvent generally has a viscosity of 0.5 to 25 centistokes at 25° C.  Suitable volatile solvents include linear silicones, cyclic silicones, paraffinic hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Cyclic silicones (or cyclomethicones) are of the general formula:<br><br>
	CH31	<br>
	i	<br>
	CH,	n<br><br>
tfhere n = 3-7.<br><br>
Linear volatile silicones in accordance with the invention have the general formula:<br>
(CH3) 3Si-0-[Si (CH3) a-0]n-Si (CH3) 3 where n=0-7, preferably 0-5.<br>
Linear and cyclic volatile silicones are available from various commercial sources including Dow Corning Corporation and General Electric. The Dow Corning volatile silicones are sold under the tradenames Dow Corning 244, 245, 344, and 200 fluids. These fluids comprise octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Also suitable as the volatile solvent are various straight or branched chain paraffinic hydrocarbons having 8 to 4 0 carbon atoms, more preferably 10-20 carbon atoms. Suitable hydrocarbons include decane, dodecane, tetradecane, tridecane, and C8.20 isoparaffins as disclosed in U.S. patent nos. 3,439,088 and 3,818,105, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.  Preferred volatile paraffinic hydrocarbons have a molecular weight of 160 to 180 and a boiling point range of 105 to 320 degrees C, and a viscosity of less than 20 cs. at 25 degrees C.  Such paraffinic hydrocarbons are available from EXXON under the ISOPARS trademark, and from the Permethyl Corporation.  Suitable C12 isoparaffins are manufactured by Permethyl Corporation under the tradename Permethyl 99A.  Another C12 isoparaffin (isododecane) is distributed by Presperse under the tradename Permethyl 99A.  Various C16 isoparaffins commercially available, such as isohexadecane (having the tradename Permethyl R), are also suitable.  The volatile solvent may be a mixture of volatile silicones and paraffinic hydrocarbons if desired.<br>
THE ORGANOSILOXANE EMULSIFIER<br>
Organosiloxane emulsifiers in accordance with the invention have been traditionally used in stabilizing cosmetic water and oil emulsions such as creams, lotions, and the like.  It has unexpectedly been discovered that combining<br><br>
an organosiloxane emulsifier (surfactant) with a volatile solvent in an anhydrous cosmetic stick composition provides a stick that is not only transfer resistant when applied to skin or lips, but at the same time provides a semi-matte finish on the skin or lips.  The semi-matte finish is achieved without substantially compromising transfer resistance.  In addition, the cosmetic has a moist and comfortable feel on the skin or lips.<br>
The composition of the invention preferably comprises 0.1-40%, more preferably 0.5-20%, and most preferably 1-15% of the polymeric organosiloxane emulsifier containing at least one lipophilic radical or portion and at least one hydrophilic radical or portion.  Organosiloxane emulsifiers suitable for use in the compositions of the invention can be identified as those which, when combined with organic and inorganic pigments, and incorporated into an anhydrous stick composition provide a homogeneous single phase product.  The polymeric organosiloxane used in the invention may be a liquid or solid at room temperature.  The polymeric organosiloxane is generally a water-in-oil or oil-in-water type surfactant which is preferably nonionic, having an Hydrophile/Lipophile Balance (HLB) of 2 to 18.  Preferably the organosiloxane is a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of 2 to 12, preferably 2 to 10, most preferably 4 to 6.  The HLB of a nonionic surfactant is the balance between the hydrophilic and lipophilic portions of the surfactant and is calculated according to the following formula: HLB  m   7  +  11.7 x log HjM0<br>
where V^  is the molecular weight of the hydrophilic group portion and M0 is the molecular weight of the lipophilic group portion.<br>
The term "organosiloxane polymer" means a polymer containing a polymeric backbone including repeating siloxy units that may have cylic, linear or branched repeating units, e.g. di(lower)alkylsiloxy units, preferably dimethylsiloxy units.  The hydrophilic portion of the organosiloxane is generally achieved by substitution onto the<br><br>
polymeric backbone of a radical that confers hydrophilic properties to a portion of the molecule.  The hydrophilic radical may be substituted on a terminus of the polymeric organosiloxane, or on any one or more repeating units of the polymer.  In general, the repeating dimethylsiloxy units of modified polydimethylsiloxane emulsifiers are lipophilic in nature due to the methyl groups, and confer lipophilicity to the molecule.  In addition, longer chain alkyl radicals, hydroxy-polypropyleneoxy radicals, or other types of lipophilic radicals may be substituted onto the siloxy backbone to confer further lipophilicity and organocompatibility.  If the lipophilic portion of the molecule is due in whole or part to a specific radical, this lipophilic radical may be substituted on a terminus of the organosilicone polymer, or on any one or more repeating units of the polymer.  It should also be understood that the organosiloxane polymer in accordance with the invention should have at least one hydrophilic portion and one lipophilic portion.<br>
The term "hydrophilic radical" means a radical that, when substituted onto the organosiloxane polymer backbone, confers hydrophilic properties to the substituted portion of the polymer.  Examples of radicals that will confer hydrophilicity are hydroxy-polyethyleneoxy, hydroxyl, carboxylates, sulfonates, sulfates, phosphates, or amines.<br>
The term "lipophilic radical" means an organic radical that, when substituted onto the organosiloxane polymer backbone, confers lipophilic properties to the substituted portion of the polymer.  Examples of organic radicals which will conver lipophilicity are Clm40  straight or branched chain alkyl, fluoro, aryl, aryloxy, C^o hydrocarbyl acyl, hydroxy-polypropyleneoxy, or mixtures thereof.  The C^Q alkyl may be non-interrupted, or interruped by one or more oxygen atoms, a benzene ring, amides, esters, or other functional groups.<br>
The polymeric organosiloxane emulsifier used in the invention may have any of the following general formulas:<br><br>
M^, or<br>
MxTy, or<br>
MDxD'yDwEM wherein each M is independently a substituted or unsubstituted trimethylsiloxy endcap unit.  If substituted, one or more of the hydrogens on the endcap methyl groups are substituted, or one or more methyl groups are substituted with a substituent that is a lipophilic radical, a hydrophilic radical, or mixtures thereof.  T is a trifunctional siloxy unit having the empirical formula RR'Si015 or RRSiOj5.  Q is a quadrifunctional siloxy unit having the empirical formula Si02, and D, D' , D", x, y, and z are as set forth below, with the proviso that the compound contains at least one hydrophilic radical and at least one lipophilic radical.  Examples of emulsifiers used in the compositions of the invention are of the general formula:<br>
MDxD'yD"zM wherein the trimethylsiloxy endcap unit is unsubstituted or mono-substituted, wherein one methyl group is substituted with a lipophilic radical or a hydrophilic radical.  Examples of such substituted trimethylsiloxy endcap units include (CH3)2HPSiO, (CH3)2LPSiO, (CH3) 2CH2HPSiO, (CH3) 2CH2LPSiO, wherein HP is a hydrophilic radical and LP is a lipophilic radical. D, D', and D" are difunctional siloxy units substituted with methyl, hydrogen, a lipophilic radical, a hydrophilic radical or mixtures thereof.  In this general formula:<br>

y = 0-5000, preferably 1-1000, and<br>
z = 0-5000, preferably 0-1000, with the proviso that the compound contains at least one lipophilic radical and at least one hydrophilic radical. Examples of these polymers are disclosed in U.S. patent no. 4,698,178, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Particularly preferred is a linear silicone of the formula:<br>

The cetyl dimethicone copolyol may be used alone or in conjunction with other non-silicone organic emulsifiers.  Preferred is where the cetyl dimethicone copolyol is in an admixture with other non-silicone organic<br><br>
emulsifiers and emollients.  In particular, blends of 25-50% of the organosiloxane emulsifier, 25-50% of a non-silicone organic emulsifier, and 25-50% by weight emollients or oils are preferred.  For example, the mixtures identified by the C.T.F.A. names cetyl dimethicone copolyol (and) polyglyceryl 4-isostearate (and) hexyl laurate, or cetyl dimethicone copolyol (and) polyglyceryl-3 oleate (and) hexyl laurate both work well.

The above mentioned powders may be surface'treated with lecithin, amino acids, mineral oil, silicone oil or various other agents either alone or in combination, which coat the powder surface and render the particles more lipophilic in nature.<br>
The powder component also may comprise various organic and inorganic pigments.  The organic pigments are generally various aromatic types including azo, indigoid, triphenylmethane, anthraquinone, and xanthine dyes which are designated as D&amp;C and FD&amp;C blues, browns, greens, oranges, reds, yellows, etc.  Organic pigments generally consist of insoluble metallic salts of certified color additives, referred to as the Lakes.  Inorganic pigments include iron oxides, ultramarines, chromium, chromium hydroxide colors, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the composition will contain both pigment and non-pigmented powders.  Obviously the percentage of pigments used in the powder component will depend on the type of cosmetic being formulated.  Color cosmetics generally have a much higher concentration of color than other types of cosmetics.  Generally the weight ratio of pigment to non-pigmented powder will range from 1:20 to 20:1.<br>
Preferred anhydrous stick cosmetic compositions in accordance with the invention comprise, by weight percent:<br>
a)   10-70% of a volatile solvent,<br><br>

► of polypropylenes as described in U.S. patent no. 5,302,380 which is hereby incorporated by reference. *<br>
Other polymers that can enhance adhesion to skin include silicone esters comprising units of the general formula RaREbSiO[4.(a+b)/2) or R13xREySi01/2, wherein R and R13 are each independently an organic radical such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl, or, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, aryl, cyclohexyl, and the like, a is a number ranging from 0 to 3, b is a number ranging from 0 to 3, a+b is a number ranging from 1 to 3, x is a number from 0 to 3, y is a number from 0 to 3 and the sum of x+y is 3, and wherein RE is a carboxylic ester containing radical.  Preferred RE radicals are those wherein the ester group is formed of one or more fatty acid moieities (e.g. of about 2, often about 3 to 10 carbon atoms) and one or more aliphatic alcohol moieities (e.g. of about 10 to 30 carbon atoms).  Examples of such acid moieities include those derived from branched-chain fatty acids such as isostearic, or straight chain fatty acids such as behenic.  Examples of suitable alcohol moieties include those derived from monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, e.g. normal alkanols such as n-propanol and branched-chain etheralkanols such as (3,3,3-trimethylolpropoxy)propane. Preferably the ester subgroup (i.e. the carbonyloxy radical) will be linked to the silicon atom by a divalent aliphatic chain that is at least 2 or 3 carbon atoms in length, e.g. an alkylene group or a divalent alkyl ether group.  Most preferably that chain will be part of the alcohol moiety, not the acid moiety.<br><br>
Preferably the silicone ester will have a melting point of no higher than about 90° C.  It can be a liquid or solid at room temperature.  Preferably it will have a waxy feel and a molecular weight of no more than about 100,000 daltons.<br>
Silicone esters having the above formula are disclosed in U.S. patent no. 4,725,658 and U.S. patent no. 5,334,737, which are hereby incorporated by reference.  Preferred silicone esters are the liquid siloxy silicates disclosed in U.S. patent no. 5,334,737, e.g. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate (prepared in Examples 9 and 14 of this, patent),  and dilauroyl trimethylolpropane siloxy silicate (prepared in Example 5 of the patent), which are commercially available from General Electric under the tradenames SF 1318 and SF 1312, respectively.<br>
Also suitable as the polymer components are materials such as PVP, PVP eicosene copolymer, polyvinylidene copolymer, and the like.<br>
It may also be desirable to add other ingredients such as preservatives, antioxidants, emollients, and so on.  If preservatives are added, 0.001-5%, preferably 0.01-3%, more preferably 0.1-2%, by weight of the total composition is suggested.<br>
The invention will be further described in connection with the following examples which are set forth for the purpose of illustration only.<br>

The above lipstick was slightly hard, but did not transfer, tfhen applied to skin it exhibited a semi-matte finish and a slightly sticky feel.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Lipsticks Q and S of Example 1 were comparatively tested igainst Revlon Colorstay and Alexandra DeMarkoff Lips Like lers.  Fifteen panelists were asked to apply each of Revlon Colorstay, Lipstick Q, Lipstick S and Alexandra DeMarkoff, jips Like Hers.  The panelists were asked to answer the following questions:<br>
Kiss Test.<br>
The lipsticks were applied to the lips and allowed to ;et for at least 60 seconds.  The panelists were asked to :iss the back of their hands and answer the following:<br>
,) Panelists who reported that the lipstick did not leave a race of color:<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The lipsticks Q and S of Example 1 (Sample A) were compared with a commercially available lipstick made by L'Oreal under the Colour Endure label (Sample B) to ascertain which product was more moisturizing to lips.<br>
A total of thirteen subjects, after having refrained from using lip products for two days, were recruited for the study.  Eleven subjects were used for the treatment group and two subjects served as the untreated control group.  Dry lips were simulated by blowing a stream of dry air over the lips for one minute.  Baseline readings were performed on the dry lips using the NOVA Dermal Phase Meter fitted with a special<br><br>
lip probe.  Subjects applied enough product to cover the lips and were instructed to refrain from licking the lips during the study.  This was a half lip study; that is, alternate sides (left vs. right) contained Sample A vs. Sample B. After fifteen minutes, sample was wiped from the lips and readings were performed.<br>
Lip moisture improved significantly for both samples A and B at fifteen minutes after one application of product. Average lip moisture improved by 75% for sample A and 43% for Sample B.  Additionally, there was directional superiority of Sample A over Sample B at the 90% confidence level.  There was no significant change in untreated control sites throughout the study.<br>
In the context of this study, both samples give lips an immediate moisture boost and there is directional superiority of the formula of Example 1 over L'Oreal Colour Endure as set forth below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
