PSEUDO-BLOCK COPOLYMERS AND PROCESS EMPLOYING CHAIN SHUTTLING AGENT<br>
Cross Reference Statement<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,938, filed March 17,2005. Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for polymerizmg a monomer or mixtures of two or more monomers such as mixtures of ethylene and one or more comonomers, to form an interpolymer product having unique physical properties, to a process for preparing such interpolymers, and to the resulting polymer products. In another aspect, the invention relates to the articles prepared fi-om these polymers. The inventive polymers comprise two or more differing regions or segments (blocks) causing the polymer to possess unique physical properties. These pseudo-block copolymers and polymeric blends comprising the same are usefully employed in the preparation of solid articles such as moldings, films, sheets, and foamed objects by molding, extruding, or other processes, and are useful as components or ingredients in adhesives, laminates, polymeric blends, and other end uses. The resulting products are used m the manufacture of components for automobiles, such as profiles, bumpers and trim parts; packaging materials; electric cable insulation, and other applications.<br>
It has long been known that polymers containing a block-type structure often have superior properties compared to random copolymers and blends. For example, triblock copolymers of styrene and butadiene (SBS) and hydrogenated versions of the same (SEES) have an excellent combination of heat resistance and elasticity. Other block copolymers are also known in the art. Generally, block copolymers known as thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) have desirable properties due to the presence of "soft" or elastomeric block segments connecting "hard" either crystallizable or glassy blocks in the same polymer. At temperatures up to the melt temperature or glass transition temperature of the hard segments, the polymers demonstrate elastomeric character. At higher temperatures, the polymers become flowable, exhibiting thermoplastic behavior. Known methods of preparing block copolymers include anionic polymerization and controlled free radical polymerization. Unfortunately, these methods of preparing block copolymers require sequential monomer addition and batch processing and the types of monomers that can be usefully employed in such methods are relatively limited. For example, in the anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene to form a SBS type block copolymer, each polymer chain requires a stoichiometric amount of initiator and the resulting polymers have extremely narrow molecular weight distribution,<br><br>
Mw/Mn, preferably from 1.0 to 1.3. Additionally, anionic and free-radical processes are relatively slow, resulting in poor process economics.<br>
It would be desirable to produce block copolymers catalytically, that is, in a process wherein more than one polymer molecule is produced for each catalyst or initiator molecule. In addition, it would be highly desirable to produce copolymers having properties resembling block copolymers from olefin monomers such as ethylene, propylene, and higher alphα-olefins that are generally unsuited for use in anionic or free-radical polymerizations. In certain of these polymers, it is highly desirable that some or all of the polymer blocks comprise amorphous polymers such as a copolymer of ethylene and a comonomer, especially amorphous random copolymers comprising ethylene and an α-olefin having 3, and especially 4, or more carbon atoms.<br>
Previous researchers have stated that certain homogeneous coordination polymerization catalysts can be used to prepare polymers having a substantially "block-like" structure by suppressing chain-transfer during the polymerization, for example, by conducting the polymerization process in the absence of a chain transfer agent and at a sufficiently low temperature such that chain transfer by P-hydride elimination or other chain transfer processes is essentially eliminated. Under such conditions, the sequential addition of different monomers was said to result in formation of polymers having sequences or segments of different monomer content. Several examples of such catalyst compositions and processes are reviewed by Coates, Hustad, and Reinartz in Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 41,2236-2257 (2002) as well as US-A-2003/0114623.<br>
Disadvantageously, such processes require sequential monomer addition and result m the production of only one polymer chain per active catalyst center, which limits catalyst productivity. In addition, the requirement of relatively low process temperatures increases the process operating costs, making such processes unsuited for commercial implementation. Moreover, the catalyst cannot be optimized for formation of each respective polymer type, and therefore the entire process results in production of polymer blocks or segments of less than maximal efficiency and/or quality. For example, formation of a certain quantity of prematurely ternunated polymer is generally unavoidable, resulting in the forming of blends having inferior polymer properties. Accordingly, imder normal operating conditions, for sequentially prepared block copolymers having Mw/Mn of 1.5 or greater, the resulting distribution of block lengths is relatively inhomogeneous, not a most probable distribution.<br>
For these reasons, it would be highly desirable to provide a process for producing olefin copolymers comprising at least some quantity of blocks or segments having differing physical properties in a process using coordination polymerization catalysts capable of operation at high catalytic efficiencies. In addition, it would be desirable to provide a process and resulting<br><br>
copolymers wherein insertion of termmal blocks or sequencing of blocks within the polymer can be influenced by appropriate selection of process conditions. Finally, if would be highly desirable to be able to use a continuous process for production of block copolymers.<br>
The use of certain metal alkyl compounds and other compounds, such as hydrogen, as chain transfer agents to interrupt cham growth in olefin polymerizations is well known in the art. In addition, it is known to employ such compounds, especially aluminum alkyl compounds, as scavengers or as cocatalysts in olefin polymerizations. In Macromolecules. 33, 9192-9199 (2000) the use of certain aluminum trialkyi compounds as chain transfer agents in combination with certain paired zirconocene catalyst compositions resulted in polypropylene mixtures containing small quantities of polymer fractions containing both isotactic and atactic chain segments. In Liu and Rytter, Macromolecular Rapid Comm.. 22, 952-956 (2001) and Bruaseth and Rytter, Macromolecules, 36,3026-3034 (2003) mixtures of ethylene and 1-hexene were polymerized by a similar catalyst composition containing trimethylaluminium chain transfer agent. In the latter reference, the authors summarized the prior art studies in the following manner (some citations omitted):<br>
"Mixing of two metallocenes with known polymerization behavior can be used to control polymer microstructure. Several studies have been performed of ethene polymerization by mixing two metallocenes. Common observations were that, by combining catalysts which separately give polyethene with different Mw, polyethene with broader and in some cases bimodal MWD can be obtamed, [S]oares and Kim (J. Polvm, Sci., Part A: Polvm. Chem.. 38,1408-1432 (2000)) developed a criterion m order to test the MWD bimodality of polymers made by dual single-site catalysts, as exemplified by ethene/1-hexene copolymerization of the mixtures Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/Cp2HfCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/ CGC (constrained geometry catalyst) supported on silica. Heiland and Kaminsky fMakromol. Chem.. 193, 601-610 (1992)) studied a mixture of Et-(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the hafnium analogue in copolymerization of ethene and 1-butene.<br>
These studies do not contain any indication of interaction between the two different sites, for example, by readsorption of a terminated chain at the alternative site. Such reports have been issued, however, for polymerization of propene. Cliien et al. (L Polvm. Sci.. Part A: Polvm. Chem., 37, 2439-2445 (1999), MakromoL, 30, 3447-3458 (1997)) studied propene polymerization by homogeneous binary zirconocene catalysts. A blend of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), atactic polypropylene (a-PP), and a stereoblock fi-action (i-PP-Z&gt;-a-PP) was obtained with a binary system comprising an<br><br>
isospecific and an aspecific precursor with a borate and TIBA as cocatalyst. By using a binary mixture of isospecific and syndiospecific zirconocenes, a blend of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP), and a stereoblock fraction (i-PP-Z&gt;-s-PP) was obtained. The mechanism for formation of the stereoblock fraction was proposed to mvolve the exchange of propagating chains between the two different catalytic sites. Przybyla and Fink (Acta Polvm„ 50, 77-83 (1999)) used two different types of metallocenes (isospecific and syndiospecific) supported on the same silica for propene polymerization. They reported that, with a certain type of silica support, chain transfer between the active species in the catalyst system occurred, and stereoblock PP was obtamed. Lieber and Brintzmger (Macromol. 3,9192-9199 (2000)) have proposed a more detailed explanation of how the transfer of a growing polymer chain from one type of metallocene to another occurs. They studied propene polymerization by catalyst mixtures of two different a?wa-zirconocenes. The different catalysts were first studied individually with regard to their tendency toward alkyl-polymeryl exchange with the alkylaluminum activator and then pairwise with respect to their capability to produce polymers with a stereoblock structure. They reported that formation of stereoblock polymers by a mixture of zirconocene catalysts with different stereoselectivities is contingent upon an efficient polymeryl exchange between the Zr catalyst centers and the Al centers of the cocatalyst,"<br>
Brusath and Rytter then disclosed their own observations using paired zirconocene catalysts to polymerize mixtures of ethylene/1-hexene and reported the effects of the influence of the dual site catalyst on polymerization activity, incorporation of comonomer, and polymer microstructure using methylalumoxane cocatalyst.<br>
Analysis of the foregoing results indicate that Rytter and coworkers likely failed to utilize combinations of catalyst, cocatalyst, and third components that were capable of readsorption of the polymer chain from the chain transfer agent onto both of the active catalytic sites, that is, two-way readsorption. While indicating that chain termination due to the presence of trimetlaylaluminum likely occurred with respect to polymer formed from the catalyst incorporating minimal comonomer, and thereafter that polymeryl exchange with the more open catalytic site followed by continued polymerization likely occurred, evidence of the reverse flow of polymer ligands appeared to be lacking in the reference. In fact, in a later communication, Rytter, et al., Polymer. 45, 7853-7861 (2004), it was reported that no chain transfer between the catalyst sites actually took place in the earlier experiments. Similar polymerizations were reported in WO98/34970.<br><br>
In U.S. Patents 6,380,341 and 6,169,151, use of a "fluxional" metallocene catalyst, that is a metallocene capable of relatively facile conversion between two stereoisomeric forms having differing polymerization characteristics such as differing reactivity ratios was said to result m production of olefin copolymers having a "blocky" structure. Disadvantageously, the respective stereoisomers of such metallocenes generally fail to possess significant difference in polymer formation properties and are incapable of forming both highly crystalline and amorphous block copolymer segments, for example, from a given monomer mixture under fixed reaction conditions. Moreover, because the relative ratio of the two "fluxional" forms of the catalyst cannot be varied, there is no ability, using "fluxional" catalysts, to vary polymer block composition or the ratio of the respective blocks. For certam applications, it is desirable to produce polymers having terminal blocks that are highly crystalline, functionalized or more readily functionalized, or that possess other distinguishing properties. For example, it is believed that polymers wherein the terminal segments or blocks are crystalline or glassy possess improved abrasion resistance. In addition, polymers wherein the blocks having amorphous properties are internal or primarily connected between crystalline or glassy blocks, have improved elastomeric properties, such as improved retractive force and recovery, particularly at elevated temperatures.<br>
In JACS, 2004,126,10701-10712, Gibson, et dl discuss the effects of "catalyzed living polymerization" on molecular weight distribution. The authors define catalyzed living polymerization in this manner:<br>
"...if chaui transfer to aluminum constitutes the sole transfer mechanism and the exchange of the growing polymer chain between the transition metal and the aluminum centers is very fast and reversible, the polymer chains will appear to be growing on the aluminum centers. This can then reasonably be described as a catalyzed chain growth reaction on aluminum.... An attractive manifestation of this type of chain growth reaction is a Poisson distribution of product molecular weights, as opposed to the Schulz-Flory distribution that arises when β-H transfer accompanies propagation."<br>
The authors reported the results for the catalyzed living homopolymerization of ethylene usmg an iron containing catalyst in combination with ZnEt2, ZnMe2, or Zn(i-Pr)2. Homoleptic alkyls of aluminum, boron, tin, litliium, magnesium and lead did not induce catalyzed chain growth. Using GaMca as cocatalyst resulted in production of a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution. However, after analysis of time-dependent product distribution, the authors concluded this reaction was, "not a simple catalyzed chain growth reaction." Accordingly, the product would<br><br>
not have constituted a pseudo-block copolymer. Similar processes employing single catalysts have been described in U.S. Patents 5,210,338, 5,276,220, and 6,444,867.<br>
Earlier workers had made similar claims to forming block copolymers using a single Ziegler-Natta type catalyst in multiple reactors arranged in series. Examples of such teachings include U.S. Patents 3,970,719 and 4,039,632. It is now known that no substantial block copolymer formation takes place under these reaction conditions.<br>
In U.S. Patents 6,319,989 and 6,683,149, the use of two loop reactors coimected in series and operating under differing polymerization conditions to prepare either broad or narrow molecular weight polymer products was disclosed. The references fail to disclose the use of chain transfer agents and the fonnation of pseudo-block copolymer products.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a polymerization process that is capable of preparing copolymers having properties approximating those of linear multi-block copolymers, in a high yield process adapted for commercial utilization. Moreover, it would be desirable if there were provided an improved process for preparing polymers, especially copolymers of two or more comonomers such as ethylene and one or more comonomers, by the use of a shuttling agent to introduce block-like properties in the resulting polymer (pseudo-block copolymers). In addition it would be desirable to provide such an improved process that is capable of preparing copolymers havmg a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution and non-random distribution of polymer segments or regions. Finally, it would be desirable to provide an improved process for preparing the foregoing desirable pseudo-block copolymer products in a continuous process.<br>

All references to the Periodic Table of the Elements herein shall refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements, published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 2003. Also, any references to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the lUPAC system for numbermg groups. Unless stated to the contrary, implicit from the context, or customary in the art, all parts and percents are based on weight. For purposes of United States patent practice, the contents of any patent, patent application, or publication referenced herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety (or the equivalent US version thereof is so incorporated by reference) especially with respect to the disclosure of synthetic techniques, definitions (to the extent not inconsistent with any definitions provided herein) and general knowledge in the art.<br><br>
The term "comprising" and derivatives thereof is not intended to exclude the presence of any additional portion, component, step or procedure, whether or not the same is disclosed herein. In order to avoid any doubt, all compositions claimed herein through use of the term "comprising" may include any additional additive, adjuvant, or compound whether polymeric or otherwise, unless stated to the contrary, In contrast, the term, "consisting essentially of excludes from the scope of any succeeding recitation any other portion, component, step or procedure, excepting those that are not essential to operability. The term "consisting of excludes any portion, component, step or procedure not specifically delineated or listed. The term "or", unless stated otherwise, refers to the listed members individually as well as in any combination.<br>
The term "polymer" includes both homopolymers, that is, homogeneous polymers prepared from a single monomer, and copolymers (interchangeably referred to herein as interpolymers), meaning polymers prepared by reaction of at least two monomers or otherwise containing chemically differentiated segments or blocks therem even if formed from a single monomer. More specifically, the term "polyethylene" includes homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and one or more C3-8 α-olefins. The term "crystalline" if employed, refers to a polymer that possesses a first order transition or crystalline melting pomt (Tm) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline". The term "amorphous" refers to a polymer lacking a crystalline melting point.<br>
The term "pseudo-block copolymer" refers to a copolymer comprising two or more regions or segments (referred to as "blocks") of differing chemical or physical property, such as variable comonomer content, crystallinity, density, tacticity, regio-error, or other property, preferably joined in a linear manner, that is, a polymer comprising blocks which are joined end-to-end, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. The various blocks are not necessarily of identical chemical composition, but vary, at least somewhat, in one or more of the foregoing respects, from the composition of adjacent blocks or regions. Compared to random copolymers, the polymers of the invention possess sufficient differences in chemical properties, especially orystallinity, between blocks or segments, to achieve many of the desired properties of true block copolymers, such as thermoplastic elastomeric properties, while at the same time being amenable to preparation in conventional olefin polymerization processes, especially continuous solution polymerization processes employing catalytic quantities of polymerization catalysts. Compared to block copolymers of the prior art, including copolymers produced by sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, or anionic polymerization techniques, the copolymers of the invention are characterized by unique distributions of polymer polydispersity (PDI or Mw/Mn), block lengdi<br><br>
distribution, and, most significantly, block composition distribution. This is due, in a preferred embodiment, to the effect of the use of a shuttling agent(s) in combination with a high activity metal complex based polymerization catalyst in a polymerization process having multiple polymerization zones or continuous variation in one or more polymerization conditions. More specifically, the polymers desirably possess PDI from 1.7 to 2.9, preferably from 1.8 to 2.5,<br>
In addition, the pseudo-block copolymers of the invention desirably possess a PDI fitting a Schutz-Flory distribution rather than a Poisson distribution. The use of the present polymerization process results in a product having a polydisperse block distribution, a polydisperse distribution of block sizes, and/or a polydisperse block composition distribution. This ultimates in the formation of polymer products having improved and distinguishable physical properties. The theoretical benefits of a polydisperse block distribution have been previously modeled and discussed m Potemkin, Physical Review E (1998) 57(6), p. 6902-6912, and Dobrynin, J. Chem. Phvs. (1997) 107(21), p 9234-9238.<br>
As used herein with respect to a chemical compound, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the singular includes all isomeric forms and vice versa (for example, "hexane", includes all isomers of hexane individually or collectively). The terms "compound" and 'complex" are used interchangeably herein to refer to organic-, inorganic- and organometal compounds. The term, "atom" refers to the smallest constituent of an element regardless of ionic state, that is, whether or not the same bears a charge or partial charge or is bonded to another atom. The term "heteroatom" refers to an atom other than carbon or hydrogen. Preferred heteroatoms include: F, CI, Br, N, O, P, B, S, Si, Sb, Al, Sn, As, Se and Ge.<br>
The term, "hydrocarbyl" refers to univalent substituents containmg only hydrogen and carbon atoms, including branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or noncyclic species. Examples Include alkyl-, cycloalkyl-, alkenyl-, alkadienyl-, cycloalkenyl-, cycloalkadienyl-, aryl-, and alkynyl- groups. "Substituted hydrocarbyl" refers to a hydrocarbyl group that is substituted with one or more nonhydrocarbyl substituent groups. The terms, "heteroatom containing hydrocarbyl" or "heterohydrocarbyr" refer to univalent groups in which at least one atom other than hydrogen or carbon is present along with one or more carbon atom and one or more hydrogen atoms. The term "heterocarbyl" refers to groups containing one or more carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms and no hydrogen atoms. The bond between the carbon atom and any heteroatom as well as the bonds between any two heteroatoms, may be saturated or unsaturated. Thus, an alkyl group substituted with a heterocycloalkyl-, substituted heterocycloalkyl-, heteroaryl-, substituted heteroaryl-, alkoxy-, aryloxy-, dihydrocarbylboiyl-, dihydrocarbylphosphino-, dihydrocarbylamino-, trihydrocarbylsilyl-, hydrocarbylthio-, or<br><br>
hydrocarbylseleno- group is within the scope of the term heteroalkyl Examples of suitable heteroalkyl groups include cyano-, benzoyl-, (2-pyridyl)methyl-, and trifluoromethyl- groups.<br>
As used herein the term "aromatic" refers to a polyatomic, cyclic, conjugated ring system containing (48+2) 7E-electrons, wherein 8 is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The term "fused" as used herein with respect to a ring system containing two or more polyatomic, cyclic rings means that with respect to at least two rings thereof, at least one pair of adjacent atoms is included in both rings. The term "aryl" refers to a monovalent aromatic substituent which may be a single aromatic ring or multiple aromatic rings which are fused together, linked covalently, or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. The aromatic ring(s) may include phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and biphenyl, among others.<br>
"Substituted aryl" refers to an aryl group in which one or more hydrogen atoms bound to any carbon is replaced by one or more functional groups such as alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, substituted heterocycloalkyl, halogen, alkylhalos (for example, CF3), hydroxy, amino, phosphido, alkoxy, amino, thio, nitro, and both saturated and unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons which are fused to the aromatic ring(s), linked covalently or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. The common linking group may also be a carbonyl as in benzophenone or oxygen as in diphenylether or nitrogen in diphenylamine.<br>
The term, "comonomer incorporation index", refers to the percent comonomer incorporated into a copolymer prepared under representative monomer/ comonomer polymerization conditions by the catalyst under consideration in the absence of other polymerization catalysts, ideally under steady-state, continuous solution polymerization conditions at greater than 95 percent monomer conversion and greater than 0.01 percent comonomer conversion. The selection of metal complexes or catalyst compositions having the greatest difference in comonomer incorporation indices under the different polymerization conditions results in copolymers from two or more monomers having the largest difference in block or segment properties, such as density.<br>
In certain circumstances the comonomer incorporation index may be determined directly, for example by the use of NMR spectroscopic techniques. Often, however, any difference in comonomer incorporation must be indirectly determined. For polymers formed from multiple monomers this may be accomplished by various techniques based on monomer reactivities.<br>
For copolymers produced by a given catalyst, the relative amounts of comonomer and monomer in the copolymer and hence the copolymer composition is determined by relative rates of reaction of comonomer and monomer. Mathematically the molar ratio of comonomer to monomer is given by<br><br><br><br>
From this equation the mole fraction of comonomer in the polymer is solely dependent on the mole fraction of comonomer in the reaction media and two temperature dependent reactivity ratios defmed in terms of the insertion rate constants as:<br><br>

In a preferred embodiment, the polymers of the invention possess a most probable distribution of block lengths and block compositions. Preferred polymers according to the invention are pseudo-block copolymers containing 4 or more blocks or segments including terminal blocks. The respective blocks or segments need not be chemically similar, and more generally are characterized by a distribution of properties. The invention involves the concept of using chain shuttling as a way to prolong the lifetime of a polymer chain such that a substantial fraction of the polymer chains experience different polymerization conditions. Thus, mstead of forming an intermolecular polymer blend, at least a portion of the polymer resulting from the present process comprises differentiated polymer segments arranged intramolecularly. Because the various regions need not possess identical chemical or physical properties (that is, each differing region may be unique) and/or a portion of the polymer may comprise random monomer incorporation, the product is referred to as a pseudo-block copolymer.<br>
In contrast with the previously discussed sequential polymerization techniques wherein no chain shuttlmg agent is utilized, polymer products can now be obtained according to the present invention by selecting highly active catalyst compositions capable of rapid transfer of polymer segments both to and from a suitable chain shuttling agent such that polymer blocks or regions of the resulting catalyst possess distinguishable polymer properties. Thus, due to the presence of a chain shuttling agent capable of rapid and efficient exchange of growing polymer chains the growing polymer experiences discontinuous polymer growth, such that intramolecular regions of the polymer are formed under multiple polymerization conditions.<br>
The following mathematical treatment of the resulting polymers is based on theoretically derived parameters fliat are believed to apply to the present mvented polymers and demonstrate that, especially in a steady-state, continuous reactor having differing polymerization conditions to which the growing polymer is exposed, especially in a repetitive manner, the block lengths of the polymer being formed at any given point in the reactor will each conform to a most probable distribution, derived in the foUowmg manner, wherein at any given point in the reactor pi is the probability of propagation with respect to block sequences from catalyst i. The theoretical treatment is based on standard assumptions and methods known in the art and used in predicting the effects of polymerization kinetics on molecular architecture, including the use of mass action reaction rate expressions that are not affected by chain or block lengths, and the assumption that polymer chain growth is completed in a very short time compared to the mean reactor residence time. Such methods have been previously disclosed in W. H. Ray, J. Macromol. Sci.. Rev. Macromol. Chem..<br><br>
C8,1 (1972) and A. E. Hamielec and J. F. MacGregor, "Polymer Reaction Engineering", K.H. Reichert and W. Geisler, Eds., Hanser, Munich, 1983, In addition it is assumed each incidence of the chain shuttling reaction results in the formation of a new polymer block, regardless of which catalyst engages in the shuttling, so that adjacent blocks formed by the same catalyst are counted as different blocks. For catalyst i, the fraction of sequences of length n being produced at any given point in the reactor is given by Xi[n], where n is an integer from 1 to infinity representing the total<br><br><br>
The overall block length distribution for the final effluent polymer is a sum of the local instantaneous block length distribution given previously by Xi[n], weighted by the local polymer production rate for catalyst i. This means that a greater diversity of polymerization conditions will have a broadening affect on the overall block length distribution.<br>

Chain Shuttling Agents<br>
The term, "shuttling agenf or "chain shuttling agenf *, refers to a compound or mixture of compounds that is capable of causing polymeryl transfer between the various active catalyst sites under the conditions of the polymerization. That is, transfer of a polymer fragment occurs both to and from an active catalyst site in a facile manner. In contrast to a shuttling agent, a "chain transfer agenf' causes termination of polymer chain growth and amounts to a one-time transfer of growing polymer from the catalyst to the transfer agent. Desirably, the intermediate formed between the<br><br>
chain shuttlmg agent and the polymeryl chain is sufficiently stable that chain termination is relatively rare. Desirably, less than 10 percent, preferably less than 50 percent, more preferably less than 75 percent and most desirably less than 90 percent of shuttling agent-polymeryl products are terminated prior to attaining 3 distinguishable, intramolecular polymer segments or blocks.<br>
While attached to the growing polymer chain, the shuttling agent desirably does not alter the polymer structure or incorporate additional monomer. That is, the shuttling agent does not also possess significant catalytic properties for the polymeri2ation of interest Rather, the shuttling agent forms a metal-alkyl or other type mteraction with the polymer moiety, for a time period such that a slightly different polymer composition is formed after transfer of the polymer moiety back to an active polymerization catalyst site. As a consequence, the subsequently formed polymer region possesses a distinguishable physical or chemical property, such as a difference in comonomer composition distribution, crystallinity, density, tacticity, regio-error, or other property. Subsequent repetitions of the foregoing process can result in formation of segments or blocks having differing properties, or a repetition of a previously formed polymer composition, depending on the rates of polymeryl exchange and transport within the reactor. The polymers of the invention desirably are characterized by individual blocks or segments having a continuously variable composition distribution. That is, adjacent blocks have slightly altered composition within the polymer chains. The composition distribution or other physical or chemical property of the various blocks according to the present invention is continuously varying, due to the gradient or variation in one or more process conditions between different regions of the reactor.<br>
The foregoing process is schematically represented for a single catalyst system in Figure 1, where catalyst A, 10, is used to prepare a first polymer moiety, 12, under a first set of polymerization conditions. The polymerization is interrupted and the growing polymer transferred to a chain shuttling agent B, the combination being illustrated as, 14, and at a subsequent time, back to a catalyst A now exposed to polymerization conditions 2, said combination being identified as, 16. Polymerization condition 2 is different in at least one respect, preferably with respect to comonomer/ monomer ratio, compared to polymerization condition 1. Polymerization commences under condition 2 but is again interrupted and the growing polymer transferred again to chain shuttling agent B, said new combination being illustrated as, 18, and subsequently, back once again to catalyst A, now exposed to polymerization condition 3. The growing polymer chain and active catalyst site are illustrated as, 20. Highly likely, polymerization condition 3 is dissimilar to both polymerization condition 1 and polymerization condition 2. Accordingly, it may be seen that multiple transfers of growing polymer may occur during the process of the invention and polymer segments within the same polymer are formed under multiple polymerization conditions. Ideally,<br><br>
the rate of chain shuttling is equivalent to or faster than the rate of polymer termination, even up to 10 or even 100 times faster than the rate of polymer termination. This permits formation of multiple polymer blocks on the same time scale as polymer propagation.<br>
By selecting different shuttling agents or mixtures of agents with a catalyst, by altering the comonomer composition, temperature, pressure, optional chain terminating agent such as H2, or other reaction conditions in multiple regions of a reactor, polymer products having segments of continuously varying densities or comonomer concentrations, block lengths, block composition distributions, and/or other distinguishing property can be prepared. For example, if the activity of the shuttling agent is low relative to the catalyst polymer chain propagation rate, the resulting copolymer will differ in composition distribution from a copolymer resulting from the use of a shuttling agent that is very fast relative to polymer chain propagation. In the former, the block lengths will tend to increase and possess greater internal variation compared to products made under the latter conditions. In a typical continuous solution polymerization reactor, the polymerization conditions will be continuously shifting between two extremes and the resulting polymer segments will reflect multiple slightly differing polymerization conditions. In addition, certain quantities of a conventional random copolymer may also be formed coincident with formation of the pseudo-block copolymer of the present invention, resulting in a resin blend. If a relatively fast shuttling agent is employed, a copolymer having shorter block lengths but more uniform composition is obtained, with little formation of random copolymer. All of the blocks may be characterized as being continuously tapering, both within individual blocks and over multiple blocks. In effect, a block copolymer having multiple, generally tapering blocks or a copolymer of continuously varying composition distribution is formed. By proper selection of both catalyst and shuttling agent, copolymers containing relatively large polymer segments or blocks approximating true block copolymers or blends of the foregoing with more random copolymers can all be obtained.<br>
A suitable composition comprising catalyst, cocatalyst, and a chain shuttling agent especially adapted for use herein can be selected by means of the following multi-step procedure:<br>
I. One or more addition polymerizable, preferably olefin monomers are polymerized using a mixture comprising a potential catalyst and a potential cham shutthng agent. This polymerization test is desirably performed using a batch or semi-batch reactor (that is, without resupply of catalyst or shuttling agent), preferably with relatively constant monomer concentration, operating under solution polymerization conditions, typically using a molar ratio of catalyst to chain shuttling agent from 1:5 to 1:500. After forming a suitable quantity of polymer, the reaction is terminated by addition of a catalyst poison and the polymer's properties (Mw, Mn, and Mw/Mn or PDI) measured.<br><br>
n. The foregoing polymerization and polymer testing are repeated for several different reaction times, providing a series of polymers having a range of yields and PDI values.<br>
in. Catalyst/ chain shuttling agent pairs demonstrating significant polymer transfer both to and from the chain shuttling agent are characterized by a polymer series wherein the minimum PDI is less than 2.0, more preferably less than 1.5, and most preferably less than 1.3. Furthermore, if chain shuttling is occurring, the Mn of the polymer will increase, preferably nearly Imearly, as conversion is increased. Most preferred catalyst/ shuttling agent pairs are those giving polymer Mn as a function of conversion (or polymer yield) fitting a line with a statistical precision (R2) of greater than 0.95, preferably greater than 0.99.<br>
Steps I-m are then carried out for one or more additional pairings of potential catalysts and/or putative shuttling agents.<br>
In addition, it is preferable that the chain shuttling agent does not reduce the catalyst activity (measured in weight of polymer produced per weight of catalyst per unit time) by more than 60 percent, more preferably such catalyst activity is not reduced by more than 20 percent, and most preferably catalyst activity of the catalyst is increased compared to the catalyst activity in the absence of a chain shuttling agent. A further consideration from a process viewpoint is that the reaction mixture should possess as low a viscosity as possible to reduce energy consumed in stirring the mixture. In this regard, a monofunctional shuttling agent is preferred to a difunctional agent which in turn is preferred to a trifunctional agent.<br>
The foregoing test is readily adapted to rapid throughput screening techniques using automated reactors and analytic probes and to formation of polymer blocks having different distinguishing properties. For example, a number of potential chain shutthng agent candidates can be pre-identified or synthesized in situ by combination of various organometal compounds with various proton sources and the compound or reaction product added to a polymerization reaction employing an olefin polymerization catalyst composition. Several polymerizations are conducted at varying molar ratios of shuttling agent to catalyst. As a minimum requirement, suitable shuttling agents are tliose that produce a minimum PDI of less than 2.0 in variable yield experiments as described above, while not significantly adversely affecting catalyst activity, and preferably improving catalyst activity, as above described.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to detect desirable catalyst/shuttling agent pairs by performing a series of polymerizations under standard batch reaction conditions and measuring the resulting number average molecular weights, PDI and polymer yield or production rate. Suitable shuttling agents are characterized by lowering of the resultant Mn without significant broadening of PDI or loss of activity (reduction in yield or rate).<br><br>
Regardless of the method for identifying, a priori, a shuttling agent, the term is meant to refer to a compound that is capable of preparing the presently identified pseudo-block copolymers under the polymerization conditions herein disclosed.<br>
Suitable shuttling agents for use herein include Group 1,2,12 or 13 metal compounds or complexes containing at least one C1-20 hydrocarbyl group, preferably hydrocarbyl substituted aluminum, gallium or zinc compounds containing from 1 to 12 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, and reaction products thereof with a proton source. Preferred hydrocarbyl groups are alkyl groups, preferably linear or branched, C2-8 alkyl groups. Most preferred shuttling agents for use in the present invention are trialkyl aluminimi and dialkyl zinc compounds, especially triethylaluminum, tri(i-propyl) aluminum, tri(i-butyl)aluminum, tri(n-hexyl)aluminum, tri(n-octyl)aluminum, triethylgallium, or diethylzmc. Additional suitable shuttling agents include the reaction product or mixture formed by combining the foregoing organometal compound, preferably a tri(C1-8) alkyl aluminum or di(C1-8) alkyl zinc compound, especially triethylaluminiuym, tri(i-propyl) aluminum, tri(i-butyl)aluminum, tri(n-hexyl)aluminum, tri(n-octyl)aIuminum, or diethylzinc, with less than a stoichiometric quantity (relative to the number of hydrocarbyl groups) of a secondary amine or a hydroxyl compound, especially bis(trimethylsilyl)amine, t-butyl(dmiethyl)siloxane, 2-hydroxymethylpyridine, di(n-pentyl)amine, 2,6-di(t-butyl)phenol, ethyl(l-naphthyl)amine, bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamine), or 2,6-diphenylphenol, Desirably, sufficient amine or hydroxyl reagent is used such that one hydrocarbyl group remains per metal atom. The primary reaction products of the foregoing combinations most desired for use in the present invention as shuttling agents are n-octylaluminum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), i-propylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxide), and n-octylaluminum di(pyridinyl-2-methoxide), i-butylaluminum bis(dimethyI(t-butyI)siIoxane), i-butylaluminum bis(di(trimethylsilyl)amide), n-octylaluminum di(pyridine-2-m6thoxide), i-butylaluminum bis(di(n-pentyl)amide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,6-di-t-butylphenoxide), n-octylaluminiun di(ethyl(l-naphthyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(t-butyldimethylsiloxide), ethylaluminum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-1-azacycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-a2:acycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxide, ethylzinc (2,6-diphenylphenoxide), and ethylzinc (t-butoxide).<br>
Preferred shuttling agents possess the highest transfer rates of polymer transfer as well as the highest transfer efficiencies (reduced incidences of chain termination). Such shuttling agents may be used in reduced concentrations and still achieve tlae desned degree of shuttling. In addition, such shuttling agents result in production of the shortest possible polymer block lengths. Highly desirably, chain shuttling agents with a single exchange site are employed due to the fact that the<br><br>
effective molecular weight of the polymer in the reactor is lowered, thereby reducing viscosity of the reaction mixture and consequently reducing operating costs.<br>

Catalysts having high comonomer incorporation properties are also known to reincorporate in situ prepared long chain olefins resulting incidentally during the polymerization through |J-hydride elimination and chain termination of growing polymer, or other process. The concentration of such long chain olefins is particularly enhanced by use of continuous solution polymerization conditions at high conversions, especially ethylene conversions of 95 percent or greater, more preferably at ethylene conversions of 97 percent or greater. Under such conditions a small but detectable quantity of olefin terminated polymer may be reincorporated into a growing polymer chain, resultmg in the formation of long cham branches, that is, branches of a carbon length greater than would result from other deliberately added comonomer. Moreover, such chains reflect the presence of other comonomers present in the reaction mixture. That is, the chains may include short chain or long chain branching as well, depending on the comonomer composition of the reaction mixture.<br>

Suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion. A". As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the catalytic derivative derived there from, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals mclude, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon.

2', 2"-nonafIuorobiphenyl)fluoroaluininate. Combinations of activators are also contemplated by the invention, for example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators in combinations, see for example, EP-A-0 573120, PCX publications WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044 and US Patents 5,153,157 and 5,453,410. WO 98/09996 describes activating catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates, including their hydrates. WO 99/18135 describes the use of organoboroaluminum activators, WO 03/10171 discloses catalyst activators that are adducts of Bronsted acids with Lewis acids. Other activators or methods for activating a catalyst compound are described in for example, US Patents 5,849,852, 5,859, 653,5,869,723, EP-A-615981, and PCX publication WO 98/32775. All of the foregoing catalyst activators as well as any other know activator for transition metal complex catalysts may be employed alone or in combination according to the present invention, however, for best results alumoxane containing cocatalysts are avoided.<br>
Xhe molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1000 to 1:1. Alumoxane, when used by itself as an activating cocatalyst, is employed in large quantity, generally at least 100 times the quantity of metal complex on a molar basis. Xris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, where used as an activating cocatalyst is employed in a molar ratio to the metal complex of from 0.5:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 6:1 most preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. Xhe remaining activating cocatalysts are generally employed in approximately equimolar quantity with the metal complex.<br>
Xhe process of the invention employing a catalyst one or more cocatalysts and chain shuttling agent may be further elucidated by reference to Figure 1, where there is illustrated<br><br>
activated catalyst, 10, which under polymerization conditions forms a polymer chain, 13, attached to the active catalyst site^ 12. A chain shuttling agent, 14, attaches to a polymer chain produced by an active catalyst site, and subsequently causes insertion of the chain segment into the active catalyst site to prepare a second generation polymer 16, which undergoes additional cham growth under polymerization conditions different from those durmg wliich the mitial polymer segment is formed thereby forming a pseudo-block copolymer, 18 attached to die active catalyst. The respective polymer segments formed in the process are distinguishable because the polymerization conditions in existence at the time of formation of the respective blocks or segments are different and the chain shuttling agent is able to prolong the polymer life time (that is the time during which further polymer growth may occur) until two or more different polymerization environments are experienced. There may be repeated exchanges between the active catalyst and the shuttling agent occurring under various differing polymerization conditions. The resulting copolymer comprises blocks or segments of differing properties whenever exchange to an area of the reactor operating under differing reaction conditions occurs. By cycling the foregoing exchange several times, preferably many times, the comonomer distribution or other distinguishing property in the resulting blocks becomes more random and approaches a most probable distribution.<br>
The growing polymer chains may be recovered while attached to a chain shuttling agent and functionalized if desired. Alternatively, the resulting polymer may be recovered by scission from the active catalyst site or from the shuttling agent, through use of a proton source or other killing agent.<br>
During the polymerization, the reaction mixture is contacted with the activated catalyst composition according to any suitable polymerization conditions. The process is desirably characterized by use of elevated temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen may be employed as a separate chain transfer agent for molecular weight control according to known techniques if desired. All of the foregoing process conditions may be varied continuously or discontinuously over separate regions of the reactor or among different reactors according to the invention. As in other similar polymerizations, it is highly desirable that the monomers and solvents employed be of sufficiently high purity that catalyst deactivation does not occur. Any suitable technique for monomer purification such as devolatilization at reduced pressure, contacting with molecular sieves or high surface area alumina, or a combination of the foregoing processes may be employed.<br>
Supports may be employed in the present invention, especially in slurry or gas-phase polymerizations. Suitable supports include solid, particulated, high surface area, metal oxides, metalloid oxides, or mixtures thereof (interchangeably referred to herein as an inorganic oxide). Examples include: talc, silica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, Sn2O3, aluminosilicates.<br><br>
borosilicates, clays, and mixtures thereof. Suitable supports preferably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to 1000 m2/g, and preferably from 100 to 600 m2lg. The average particle size typically is from 0.1 to 500 μm, preferably from 1 to 200 μm, more preferably 10 to 100 |im.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the present catalyst composition and optional support may be spray dried or otherwise recovered in solid, particulated form to provide a composition that is readily transported and handled. Suitable methods for spray drying a liquid containing slurry are well known in the art and usefully employed herein. Preferred techniques for spray drying catalyst compositions for use herein are described in US'-A's-5,648,310 and 5,672,669.<br>
The polymerization is desirably carried out as a continuous polymerization, preferably a continuous, solution polymerization, in which catalyst components, shuttling agent(s), monomers, and optionally solvent, adjuvants, scavengers, and polymerization aids are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed there from. Within the scope of the terms "continuous** and "continuously" as used in this context are those processes in which there are intermittent additions of reactants and removal of products at small regular or irregular intervals, so that, over time, the overall process is substantially continuous. Moreover, as previously explained, a monomer gradient, temperature gradient, pressure gradient, or other difference in polymerization conditions is maintained between at least two regions of the reactor undergoing polymerization or in differing reactors connected in a closed loop or cycle, so that polymer segments of differing composition such as comonomer content, crystallinity, density, tacticity, regio-regularity, or other chemical or physical difference are formed at different times during formation of the growing polymer chain.<br>
The process can be operated in a high pressure, solution, slurry, or gas phase polymerization process. For a solution polymerization process it is desirable to employ homogeneous dispersions of the catalyst components in a liquid diluent in which the polymer is soluble under the polymerization conditions employed. One such process utilizing an extremely fine silica or similar dispersing agent to produce such a homogeneous catalyst dispersion where either the metal complex or the cocatalyst is only poorly soluble is disclosed in US-A-5,783,512. A high pressure process is usually carried out at temperatures from 100°C to 400°C and at pressures above 500 bar (50 MPa). A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures of from 0°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerization medium. Preferred temperatures in a slurry polymerization are from 30X, preferably from 60°C up to 115°C, preferably up to 100°C. Pressures typically range from atmospheric (100 kPa) to 500 psi (3.4 MPa).<br><br>
In all of the foregoing processes, continuous or substantially continuous polymerization conditions are preferably employed. The use of such polymerization conditions, especially contmuous, solution polymerization processes, allows the use of elevated reactor temperatures which results m the economical production of pseudo-block copolymers in high yields and efficiencies. Both homogeneous and plug-flow type reaction conditions may be employed with the proviso that a gradient of at least one process condition with respect to polymer chain formation over time is achieved. Desirably, at least some polymer is present at the point of catalyst or monomer addition. This may be accomplished in one embodiment by use of varying quantities of recycle (including no recycle). A highly preferred reactor for use herein is a loop or tubular reactor. Also suitable is the use of multiple reactors, especially multiple continuous stirred or back-mixed reactors (CSTR), desirably coimected in series, or multiple zones in a reactor.<br>
The metal complex may be prepared as a homogeneous composition by addition of the requisite metal complex or multiple complexes to a solvent in which the polymerization will be conducted or in a diluent compatible with the ultimate reaction mixture. The desired cocatalyst or activator and the shuttling agent may be combined with the catalyst composition either prior to, shnultaneously with, or after combination with the monomers to be polymerized and any additional reaction diluent.<br>
At all times, the individual mgredients as well as any active catalyst composition must be protected from oxygen, moisture and other catalyst poisons. Therefore, the catalyst components, shuttling agent and activated catalysts must be prepared and stored in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere, preferably under a dry, inert gas such as nitrogen.<br>
Without limiting in any way the scope of the invention, one means for carrying out such a polymerization process is as follows. In one or more loop reactors operating under solution polymerization conditions, the monomers to be polymerized are mtroduced continuously together with any solvent or diluent at one part of the reactor. The reactor contains a liquid phase composed substantially of monomers together with any solvent or diluent and dissolved polymer. Preferred solvents include C4.10 hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof, especially alkanes such as hexane or mixtures of alkanes, as well as one or more of the monomers employed in the polymerization. Examples of suitable loop reactors and a variety of suitable operating conditions for use therewith, including the use of multiple loop reactors, operating in series, are found in U.S. Patents 5,977,251, 6,319,989 and 6,683,149.<br>
Catalyst along with cocatalyst and chain shuttling agent are continuously or intermittently introduced in the reactor liquid phase or any recycled portion thereof at a minimum of one location. The reactor temperature and pressure may be controlled by adjusting the solvent/monomer ratio, the<br><br>
catalyst addition rate, as well as by cooling or heating coils Jackets or both. The polymerization rate is controlled by the rate of catalyst addition. The ethylene content of the polymer product is determined by the ratio of ethylene to comonomer in the reactor, which is controlled by manipulating the respective feed rates of these components to the reactor. The polymer product molecular weight is controlled, optionally, by controlling other polymerization variables such as the temperature, monomer concentration, or by the previously mentioned cham shuttling agent, as is well known in the art. Between at least two regions of the reactor, a differential in at least one process condition is established. Preferably for use in formation of a copolymer of two or more monomers, the difference is a difference in comonomer content Upon exiting the reactor, the effluent is contacted with a catalyst kill agent such as water, steam or an alcohol. The polymer solution is optionally heated, and the polymer product is recovered by flashing off gaseous monomers as well as residual solvent or diluent at reduced pressure, and, if necessary, conducting further devolatilization in equipment such as a devolatilizing extruder. In a continuous process the mean residence time of the catalyst and polymer in the reactor generally is from 5 minutes to 8 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
Alternatively, the foregomg polymerization may be carried out in a plug flow reactor with a monomer, catalyst, shuttling agent, temperature or other gradient established between differing regions thereof, optionally accompanied by separated addition of catalysts and/or chain shuttling agent, and operating under adiabatic or non-adiabatic polymerization conditions.<br>
The catalyst composition may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing the requisite components on an inert inorganic or organic particulated solid, as previously disclosed. In a preferred embodiment, a heterogeneous catalyst is prepared by co-precipitating the metal complex and the reaction product of an inert inorganic compound and an active hydrogen containing activator, especially the reaction product of a tri (CM alkyl) alummum compound and an ammonium salt of a hydroxyaryltris(pentafluorophenyl)borate, such as an ammonium salt of (4-hydroxy-3,5-ditertiarybutylphenyl)tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate. When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, the catalyst composition may be employed in a slurry or a gas phase polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 carbon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as eliiane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. As with a solution polymerization, the α-olefin comonomer or a mixture of different α-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Most preferably at least a major part of the diluent comprises the α-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br><br>
Preferably for use in gas phase polymerization processes, the support material and resulting catalyst has a median particle diameter from 20 to 200 μm, more preferably from 30μm to 150 μm, and most preferably from 50 μm to 100 μm. Preferably for use in slurry polymerization processes, the support has a median particle diameter from 1 μm to 200μm, more preferably from 5 μm to 100 fμm, and most preferably from 10 μm to 80μm.<br>
Suitable gas phase polymerization process for use herein are substantially similar to known processes used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of polypropylene, ethylene/ a-olefin copolymers, and other olefin polymers. The gas phase process employed can be, for example, of the type which employs a mechanically stirred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction zone. Preferred is the process wherein the polymerization reaction is carried out in a vertical cylmdrical polymerization reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer particles supported or suspended above a perforated plate or fluidization grid, by a flow of fluidization gas.<br>
The gas employed to fluidize the bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reaction from the bed. The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilization zone, also ,   known as a velocity reduction zone, having a wider diameter than the fluidized bed and wherein fine particles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed. It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine particles from the hot gas stream. The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerization.<br>
A preferred method of cooling of the bed, in addition to the cooling provided by the cooled recycle gas, is to feed a volatile liquid to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect, often referred to as operation in the condensing mode. The volatile liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volatile inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having 3 to 8, preferably 4 to 6, carbon atoms. In the case tliat the monomer or comonomer itself is a volatile liquid, or can be condensed to provide such a liquid, this can suitably be fed to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect. The volatile liquid evaporates m the hot fluidized bed to form gas which mixes witli the fluidizmg gas. If the volatile liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerization in the bed. The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop. the recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will precipitate from the gas. This liquid is desirably recycled continuously to the fluidized bed. It is possible to recycle the precipitated liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried in<br><br>
the recycle gas stream. This type of process is described, for example in EP-89691; U.S. 4,543,399; WO-94/25495 and U.S. 5,3 52,749. A particularly preferred method of recycling the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid directly into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed. This type of process is described m WO-94/28032.<br>
The polymerization reaction occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the continuous or semi-continuous addition of catalyst composition according to the invention. The catalyst composition may be subjected to a prepolymerization step, for example, by polymerizing a small quantity of olefin monomer in a liquid inert diluent, to provide a catalyst composite comprising supported catalyst particles embedded in olefin polymer particles as well.<br>
The polymer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by polymerization of the monomer or mixture of monomers on the fluidized particles of catalyst composition, supported catalyst composition or prepolymerized catalyst composition within the bed. Start-up of the polymerization reaction is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer particles, which are preferably similar to the desired polymer, and conditioning the bed by drying with inert gas or nitrogen prior to introducing the catalyst composition, the monomers and any other gases which it is desired to have in the recycle gas stream, such as a diluent gas, hydrogen chain transfer agent, or an inert condensable gas when operating in gas phase condensing mode. The produced polymer is discharged continuously or semi-contmuously from the fluidized bed as desired.<br>
The gas phase processes most suitable for the practice of this invention are continuous processes which provide for the continuous supply of reactants to the reaction zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reaction zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reaction zone of the reactor. Products are readily recovered by exposure to reduced pressure and optionally elevated temperatures (devolatilization) according to known techniques. Typically, the fluidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at temperatures greater than 50°C, preferably from 60°C to 110°C, more preferably from 70°C to 110°C.<br>
Suitable gas phase processes which are adaptable for use in the process of this invention are disclosed in US Patents: 4,588,790; 4,543,399; 5,352,749; 5,436,304; 5,405,922; 5,462,999; 5,461,123; 5,453,471; 5,032,562; 5,028,670; 5,473,028; 5,106,804; 5,556,238; 5,541,270; 5,608,019; and 5,616,661.<br>
As previously mentioned, functionalized derivatives of pseudo-block copolymers are also included within the present invention. Examples inchide metallated polymers wherein the metal is the remnant of the catalyst or chain shuttling agent employed, as well as further derivatives thereof.<br><br>
for example, the reaction product of a metallated polymer with an oxygen source and then with water to form a hydroxyl terminated polymer. Additional examples include olefin terminated polymers formed by β-hydride elimination.<br>
Because a substantial fraction of the polymeric product exiting the reactor is terminated with the chain shuttling agent, further functionalization is relatively easy. The metallated polymer species can be utilized in well known chemical reactions such as those suitable for other alkyl-aluminum, alkyl-gallium, alkyl-zinc, or alkyl-Grroup I compounds to form amine-, hydroxy-, epoxy-, and other functionalized terminated polymer products. Examples of suitable reaction techniques that are adaptable for use here in are described in Negishi, "Orgaonmetallics in Organic Synthesis", Vol. 1 and 2, (1980), and other standard texts in organometallic and organic synthesis.<br>

Preferred polymers comprise in polymerized form at least one monomer selected from the group consistmg of ethylene, propylene and 4-methyH-pentene. Highly desirably, the polymers are interpolymers comprising in polymerized form ethylene, propylene or 4-methyl-l-pentene and at least one different C2.20 α-olefin comonomer, and optionally one or more additional copolymerizable comonomers. Suitable comonomers are selected from diolefins, cyclic olefins, and cyclic diolefins, halogenated vinyl compounds, and vinylidene aromatic compounds.<br>

The density of the invented polymers can be from 0.80 to 0.99 g/cm2 and preferably for ethylene containing polymers from 0.85 g/cm2 to 0,97 g/cm2.<br>
The polymers of the invention may be differentiated from conventional, random copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. The separate regions or blocks within each polymer contain gradual changes in composition (tapering) rather than distinct starting and ending points. In addition, several cycles between extremes of polymer composition, such as multiple gradual changes in comonomer distribution may be present in each polymer. For example, the comonomer distribution, tacticity, or other property of segments within<br><br>
the polymer may cycle several times between a maximum and minimum within the same polymer because the polymer experienced different process conditions during the course of its production and segments formed under various conditions while attached to the active catalyst are all present in the polymer. The various maxima and minima are characterized by increased crystallinity, tacticity, or other physical property, depending on the process condition being varied. Preferably, polymer is formed in regions of the reactor wherein monomer/comonomer ratio or comonomer content is varied. Because the polymer products have multiple blocks or segments, but few or none of the blocks are identical in size or composition, they are referred to as pseudo-block copolymers. The resulting polymers have properties approximating in many respects, those of pure block copolymers, and in some aspects exceeding the properties of pure block copolymers. In a final distinguishmg feature, the blocks or segments of the pseudo-block copolymers in one embodiment of the invention may be shown to gradually change in one or more physical properties or measurements over sets of adjacent blocks rather than abruptly change between blocks. Preferred polymers have at least 4, more preferably at least 5 segments formed according to the present invention.<br>
Compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the polymers of die invention have one or more distinguishing features, including better (higher) heat resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher high-temperature tensile strength, and/or higher high-temperature torsion modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Compared to a random copolymer comprising the same monomers and monomer content, the inventive polymers have one or more of the following: lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification) temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.<br>
The polymers desirably comprise distributions in number, block size, and/or composition of polymer blocks, which are Schultz-Flory or most probable distributions.<br>
Other highly desirable compositions according to the present invention are elastomeric intexpolymers of ethylene, a C3-20 α-olefin, especially propylene, and optionally one or more diene monomers. Preferred α-olefins for use in this embodiment of the present invention are designated by the formula CH2==CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of jBrom 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable α-olefins include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, and 1-octene. A particularly preferred α-olefin is propylene. The nrouvlene based nolvmers are eenerallv referred to in the art as EP or EPDM<br><br>
polymers depending on whether a copolymerized diene is also present. Suitable dienes for use in preparing pseudo-block EPDM type polymers include conjugated or non-conjugated, straight or branched chain-, cyclic- or polycyclic- dienes containing from 4 to 20 carbons. Preferred dienes include 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-ethylidene-2-norboraene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, and 5-butylidene-2-norbomene. A particularly preferred diene is 5-ethyIidene-2-norbornene.<br>
Because the diene containing polymers contain alternating segments or blocks containing greater or lesser quantities of the diene (including none) and α-olefin (including none), the total quantity of diene and α-olefin may be reduced without loss of subsequent polymer properties. That is, because the diene and α-olefin monomers are preferentially incorporated into one type of block of the polymer rather than uniformly or randomly throughout the polymer, they are more efficiently utilized and subsequently the crosslink density of the polymer can be better controlled. Such crosslinkable elastomers and the cured products have advantaged properties, including higher tensile strength and better elastic recovery.<br>
Further preferably, the pseudo-block polymers of the invention have an ethylene content from 1 to 99 percent, a diene content from 0 to 10 percent, and a styrene and/or C3.8 α-olefin content from 99 to 1 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Preferred polymers are interpolymers of ethylene, propylene and optionally a diene. Desirably, the polymers of the invention have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to 2,500,000, a polydispersity less than 3.5, more preferably less than 3.0, and a Mooney viscosity (ML (1+4) 125 °C.) from 1 to 250.<br>
More preferably, such polymers have an ethylene content from 10 to 98 percent, a diene content from 0 to 6 percent, an α-olefin content from 2 to 90 percent, a Mw from 20,000 to 250,000, a polydispersity from 1.5 to 3.0, and a Mooney viscosity from 10 to 100. Especially preferred interpolymers are propylene/ ethylene copolymers containing greater than 10 percent ethylene, preferably greater than 15 percent ethylene, and having a pellet blocking strength less than or equal to 3 kPa and or a compression set less than or equal to 50 percent at 23°C.<br>
The polymer may be oil extended with from 5 to 75 percent, preferably from 10 to 60 percent, more preferably from 20 to 50 percent, based on total composition weight, of a processing oil. Suitable oils include any oil that is conventionally used in manufacturing extended EPDM rubber formulations. Examples mclude both naphthenic- and paraffinic- oils, with paraffinic oils being preferred.<br>
Highly desirably a curable EPDM rubber formulation is prepared by incorporation of one or more curing agents along with conventional accelerators or other adjuvants. Suitable curing agents<br><br>
are sulfur based. Examples of suitable sulfur based curing agents include, but are not limited to, sulfur, tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide (DPTT), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 2-mercaptobenzothiazolate disulfide (MBTS), zinc-2-mercaptobenozothiazolate (ZMBT), zinc diethyldithiocarbamatezinc (ZDEC), zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate (ZDBC), dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide (DPTT), N-t-butylbenzothiazole-2- sulfanamide (TBBS), and mixtures thereof. A preferred cure system includes a combination of sulfur, MBT and TMTD. Desirably, the foregoing components are employed in amounts from 0.1 to 5 percent, based on total composition weight.<br>
A preferred elastomer composition according to tliis embodiment of the invention may also include carbon black. Preferably, the carbon black is present in the amount of from 10 to 80 percent, more preferably from 20 to 60 percent, based on total composition weight<br>

Compositions comprising the olefin polymers can also be formed into fabricated articles such as those previously mentioned using conventional polyolefm processing techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art of polyolefin processing.<br>

Frothed foams comprising the mvented polymers can also be formed, as disclosed in PCX application No. 2004/027593, filed August 25, 2004, The polymers may also be crosslinked by any known means, such as the use of peroxide, electron beam, silane, azide, or other cross-linking technique. The polymers can also be chemically modified, such as by grafting (for example by use of maleic anhydride (MAH), silanes, or other grafting agent), halogenation, amination, sulfonation, or other chemical modification.<br>
Additives and adjuvants may be included in any formulation comprising the present polymers. Suitable additives include fillers, such as organic or inorganic particles, including clays, talc, titanium dioxide, zeolites, powdered metals, organic or inorganic fibers, including carbon fibers, silicon nitride fibers, steel wire or mesh, and nylon or polyester cording, nano-sized particles, clays, and so forth; tackifiers, oil extenders, including paraffinic or napthelenic oils; and other natural and synthetic polymers, uicluding other polymers according to the mvention.<br>
Suitable polymers for blendmg witli the polymers of the invention include thermoplastic and non-thermoplastic polymers including natural and synthetic polymers. Exemplary polymers for blending include polypropylene, (both impact modifying polypropylene, isotactic polypropylene, atactic polypropylene, and random ethylene/propylene copolymers), various types of polyethylene, including high pressure, fi-ee-radical LDPE, Ziegler Natta LLDPE, metallocene PE, including multiple reactor PB ("in reactor" blends of Ziegler-Natta PE and metallocene PE, such as products disclosed in U.S. Patents 6,545,088, 6,538,070, 6,566,446, 5,844,045, 5,869,575, and 6,448,341, etliylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene/ vinyl alcohol copolymers, polystyrene, impact modified polystyrene, ABS, styrene/butadiene block copolymers and hydrogenated derivatives thereof (SBS and SEBS), and thermoplastic polyurethanes. Homogeneous polymers such as olefin plastomers and elastomers, ethylene and propylene-based copolymers (for example polymers available under the trade designation VERSIFYTM available from The Dow Chemical Company and<br><br>
VISTAMAXX7TM available from ExxonMobil can also be useful as components in blends comprising the present polymers.<br>
Suitable end uses for the foregoing products include films and fibers; molded articles, such as tooth brush handles and appliance handles; gaskets and profiles; adhesives (including hot melt adhesives and pressure sensitive adhesives); footwear (including shoe soles and shoe liners); auto interior parts and profiles; foam goods (both open and closed cell); impact modifiers for other thermoplastic polymers such as EPDM, isotactic polypropylene, or other olefin polymers; coated fabrics; hoses; tubing; weather stripping; cap liners; flooring; and viscosity index modifiers, also known as pour point modifiers, for lubricants.<br>
In a highly desired embodiment of the invention thermoplastic compositions comprising a thermoplastic matrix polymer, especially isotactic polypropylene, and an elastomeric pseudo-block copolymer according to the invention, are uniquely capable of forming core-shell type particles having hard crystalline or semi-crystalline blocks in the form of a core surrounded by soft or elastomeric blocks forming a "shell" around the occluded domains of hard polymer. These particles are formed and dispersed within the matrix polymer by the forces incurred during melt compounding or blending. This highly desirable morphology is believed to result due to the unique physical properties of the multi-block copolymers which enable compatible polymer regions such as the matrix and higher comonomer content elastomeric regions of the pseudo-block copolymer to self-assemble in the melt due to thennodynamic forces. Shearing forces during compounding are believed to produce separated regions of matrix polymer encircled by elastomer. Upon solidifying, these regions become occluded elastomer particles encased in the polymer matrix.<br>
Particularly desirable blends are thermoplastic polyolefin blends (TPO), thermoplastic elastomer blends (TPE), thermoplastic vulcanisites (TPV) and styrenic polymer blends. TPE and TPV blends may be prepared by combining the invented pseudo-block polymers, including functionalized or unsaturated derivatives thereof with an optional rubber, including conventional block copolymers, especially an SBS block copolymer, and optionally a crosslinking or vulcanizing agent TPO blends are generally prepared by blending the invented pseudo-block copolymers with a polyolefin, and optionally a crosslinking or vulcanizing agent. The foregoing blends may be used in forming a molded object, and optionally crosslinking the resulting molded article. A similar procedure using different components has been previously disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,797,779,<br>
Suitable conventional block copolymers for this application desirably possess a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+4 @ 100°C.) in the range from 10 to 135, more preferably from 25 to 100, and most preferably from 30 to 80. Suitable polyolefins especially include linear or low density polyethylene, polypropylene (including atactic, isotactic, syndiotactic and impact modified versions<br><br>
thereof) and poly(4-methyH-pentene). Suitable styrenic polymers include polystyrene, rubber modified polystyrene (HIPS), styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers (SAN), rubber modified SAN (ABS or ABS) and styrene maleic anhydride copolymers.<br>
The blends may be prepared by mixing or kneading the respective components at a temperature around or above the melt point temperature of one or both of the components. For most multiblock copolymers, this temperature may be above 130° C, most generally above 145° C, and most preferably above 150° C. Typical polymer mixing or kneading equipment that is capable of reaching the desired temperatures and melt plastifying the mixture may be employed. These include mills, kneaders, extruders (both single screw and twin-screw), Banbury mixers, and calenders. The sequence ofmixing and method may depend on the final composition. A combination of Banbury batch mixers and continuous mixers may also be employed, such as a Banbury mixer followed by a mill mixer followed by an extruder. Typically, a TPE or TPV composition will have a higher loading of cross-linkable polymer (typically the conventional block copolymer containing unsaturation) compared to TPO compositions. Generally, for TPE and TPV compositions, the weight ratio of block copolymer to pseudo-block copolymer should be from 90:10 to 10:90, more preferably from 80:20 to 20:80, and most preferably from 75:25 to 25: 50. For TPO applications, the weight ratio of pseudo-block copolymer to polyolefin may be from 49:51 to 5:95, more preferably from 35:65 to 10:90. For modified styrenic polymer applications, the weight ratio of pseudo-block copolymer to polyolefin may also be from 49:51 to 5:95, more preferably from 35:65 to 10:90. The ratios may be changed by changing the viscosity ratios of the various components. There is considerable literature illustrating techniques for changing the phase contfaiuity by changing the viscosity ratios of the constituents of a blend and a person skilled in this art may consult if necessary.<br>
The blend compositions may contain processing oils, plasticizers, and processing aids. Rubber processing oils have a certain ASTM designations and paraffinic, napthenic or aromatic process oils are all suitable for use. Generally from 0 to 150 parts, more preferably 0 to 100 parts, and most preferably from 0 to 50 parts of oil per 100 parts of total polymer are employed. Higher amounts of oil may tend to improve the processing of the resultmg product at the expense of some physical properties. Additional processing aids include conventional waxes, fatty acid salts, such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate, (poly)alcohols including glycols, (poly)alcohol ethers, including glycol ethers, (poly)esters, including (poly)gIycol esters, and metal salt-, especially Group 1 or 2 metal or zinc-, salt derivatives thereof.<br>
It is known that non-hydrogenated rubbers such as those comprising polymerized forms of butadiene or isoprene, including block copolymers (here-in-after diene rubbers), have lower<br><br>
resistance to UV, ozone, and oxidation, compared to mostly or highly saturated rubbers. In applications such as tires made from compositions containing higher concentrations of diene based rubbers, it is known to incorporate carbon black to improve rubber stability, along with anti-ozone additives or antioxidants. Pseudo-block copolymers according to the present invention possess extremely low levels of unsaturation, and find particular application as a protective surface layer (coated, coextruded or laminated) or weather resistant film adhered to articles formed from conventional diene elastomer modified polymeric compositions.<br>
For certain of the present TPO, TPV, and TPE applications, carbon black is the additive of choice for UV absorption and stabilization. Representative examples of carbon blacks include<br>
ASTMN110,N121,N220,N231,N234,N242,N293,N299,S315,N326,N330,M332,N339, N343, N347, N351, N358, N375, N539, N55D, N582, N630, N642, N650, N683, N754, N762, N765, N774, N787, N907, N908, N990 and N99L These carbon blacks have iodine absorptions ranging from 9 to 145 g/kg and average pore volumes ranging from 10 to 150 cm^/100 g. Generally, smaller particle sized carbon blacks are employed, to the extent cost considerations permit. For many such applications the present pseudo-block copolymers and blends thereof require little or no carbon black, thereby allowing considerable design freedom to include alternative pigments or no pigments at all.<br>
Compositions, including thermoplastic blends according to the invention may also contain anti-ozonants and anti-oxidants that are known to a rubber chemist of ordinary skill. The anti-ozonants may be physical protectants such as waxy materials that come to the surface and protect the part from oxygen or ozone or they may be chemical protectors that react with oxygen or ozone. Suitable chemical protectors include styrenated phenols, butylated octylated phenol, butylated di(dimethylbenzyl) phenol, p-phenylenediamines, butylated reaction products of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), polyphenolic anitioxidants, hydroquinone derivatives, quinoline, diphenylene antioxidants, tliioester antioxidants, and blends thereof. Some representative trade names of such products are Wingstay"™ S antioxidant, Polystay™ 100 antioxidant, Polystay'™100 AZ antioxidant, Polystay™ 200 antioxidant, Wingstay™ L antioxidant, Wingstay™ LHLS antioxidant, Wingstay™ K antioxidant, Wingstay™ 29 antioxidant, Wingstay™ SN-1 antioxidant, and Irganox™ antioxidants. In some applications, the antioxidants and antiozonants used will preferably be non-staining and non-migratory.<br>
For providing additional stability against UV radiation, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and UV absorbers may be also used. Suitable examples include Tinuvin™ 123, Tinuvin'™ 144, Tinuvin™ 622, Tinuvin™ 765, Tinuvin™ 770, and Tinuvin™ 780, available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, and Chemisorb™ T944, available from Cytex Plastics, Houston, TX, USA. A<br><br>
Lewis acid may be additionally included with a HALS compound in order to achieve superior surface quality, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,051,681.<br>
For some compositions, additional mixing process may be employed to pre-disperse the anti-Dxidants, anti-ozonants, carbon black, UV absorbers, and/or light stabilizers to form a masterbatch, and subsequently to form polymer blends there from.<br>
Suitable crosslinking agents (also referred to as curing or vulcanizing agents) for use herein mclude sulfur based, peroxide based, or phenolic based compounds. Examples of the foregoing materials are found in the art, includmg in U.S. Patents: 3,758,643,3,806,558, 5,051,478, 4,104,210,4,130,535,4,202,801,4,271,049,4,340,684,4,250,273,4,927,882,4,311,628 and 5,248,729.<br>
Wlien sulfur based curing agents are employed, accelerators and cure activators may be used as well. Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for dynamic vulcanization and to unprove the properties of the resulting cross-linked article. In one embodiment, a single accelerator or primary accelerator is used. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from 0.5 to 4, preferably 0.8 to 1.5, phr, based on total composition weight In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, such as from 0.05 to 3 phr, in 3rder to activate and to improve the properties of the cured article. Combinations of accelerators generally produce articles having properties that are somewhat better than those produced by use of 1 single accelerator. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by lormal processing temperatures yet produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, iulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. fa second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. Certain processing aids and cure activators such as stearic acid and ZnO nay also be used. When peroxide based curing agents are used, co-activators or coagents may be used in combination therewith. Suitable coagents include trunethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), rimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA), triallyl cyanurate (TAC), triallyl isocyanurate TAIC), among others. Use of peroxide crosslinkers and optional coagents used for partial or complete dynamic vulcanization are known in the art and disclosed for example in the publication, Peroxide Vulcanization of Elastomers", Vol. 74, No 3, July-August 2001.<br>
When the pseudo-block copolymer containing composition is at least partially crosslinked, be degree of crosslinking may be measured by dissolving the composition in a solvent for specified<br><br>
duration, and calculating the percent gel or unextractable rubber. The percent gel normally increases with increasing crosslinking levels. For cured articles according to the invention, the percent gel content is desirably in the range  from 5 to 100 percent<br>
The pseudo-block copolymers of the invention as well as blends thereof possess improved processability compared to prior art compositions, due, it is believed, to lower melt viscosity. Thus, the composition or blend demonstrates an improved surface appearance, especially when formed into a molded or extruded article. At the same time, the present compositions and blends thereof uniquely possess improved melt strength properties, thereby allowing the present pseudo-block copolymers and blends thereof, especially TPO blends, to be usefully employed in foam and in thermoforming applications where melt strengfli is currently inadequate.<br>
Thermoplastic compositions according to the invention may also contain organic or inorganic fillers or other additives such as starch, talc, calcium carbonate, glass fibers, polymeric fibers (including nylon, rayon, cotton, polyester, and polyaramide), metal fibers, flakes or particles, expandable layered silicates, phosphates or carbonates, such as clays, mica, silica, alumina, aluminosilicates or aluminophosphates, carbon whiskers, carbon fibers, nanoparticles including nanotubes, wollastonite, graphite, zeolites, and ceramics, such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride or titanias. Silane based or other coupling agents may also be employed for better filler bonding.<br>
The thermoplastic compositions of this invention, including the foregoing blends, may be processed by conventional molding techniques such as injection molding, extrusion molding, thermoforming, slush molding, over molding, insert molding, blow molding, and other techniques. Films, including multi-layer films, may be produced by cast or tentering processes, including blown film processes.<br>
Testing Methods<br>
In the foregoing characterizing disclosure and the examples that follow, the following analytical techniques are employed: Standard CRYSTAF Method<br>
Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain. The samples are dissolved in 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene at 160 °C (0.66 mg/mL) for 1 hr and stabilized at 95°C for 45 minutes. The sampling temperatures range from 95 to 30 °C at a cooling rate of 0.2 °C/min. An infi-ared detector is used to measure the polymer solution concentrations. The cumulative soluble concentration is measured as the polymer crystallizes while the temperature<br><br>
is decreased. The analytical derivative of the cumulative profile reflects the short chain branching distribution of the polymer.<br>
The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included m the CRYSTAF Software (Version 200l.b, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spam). The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW/dT and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. DSC Standard Method<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using a TAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml/min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at 175°C and then air-cooled to room temperature (25 °C). 10 mg of material in the form of a 5-6 mm diameter disk is accurately weighed and placed in an aluminum foil pan (ca 50 mg) which is then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180°C and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thermal history. The sample is then cooled to -40°C at 10°C/min cooling rate and held at -40°C for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150 °C at 10°C/min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded.<br>
The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate (W/g) with respect to the linear baseline drawn between -30 °C and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between -30 °C and the end of melting using a linear baseline. Abrasion Resistance<br>
Abrasion resistance is measured on compression molded plaques according to ISO 4649. The average value of 3 measurements is reported. Plaques of 6.4 mm thick are compression molded using a hot press (Carver Model #4095-4PR1001R). The pellets are placed between polytetrafluoroethylene sheets, heated at 190 °C at 55 psi (380 kPa) for 3 min, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 min, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 mm. Next the film is cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for  min. GPC Method<br>
The gel permeation chromatographic system consists of either a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-210 or a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-220 instrument. The column and carousel compartments are operated at 140 °C. Three Polymer Laboratories 10-micron Mixed-B columns are used. The solvent is 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene. The samples are prepared at a concentration of 0.1 grams of polymer in 50 milliliters of solvent containmg 200 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene<br><br>
(BHT). Samples are prepared by agitatmg lightly for 2 hours at 160°C. The injection volume used is 100 microliters and the flow rate is1.0 ml/minute.<br>
Calibration of the GPC column set is performed with 21 narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 8,400,000, arranged in 6 "cocktail" mixtures with at least a decade of separation between individual molecular weights. The standards are purchased from Polymer Laboratories (Shropshire, UK). The polystyrene standards are prepared at 0.025 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights equal to or greater than 1,000,000, and 0.05 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights less than 1,000,000. The polystyrene standards are dissolved at 80 °C with gentle agitation for 30 minutes. The narrow standards mixtures are run first and in order of decreasing highest molecular weight component to minimize degradation. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation (as described in Williams and Ward, J. Polvm. Sci.. Polvm. Let. 6, 621 (1968)): Mpoiycthyiaw = 0.431(Mpoiystyrene)-<br>
Polyetheylene equivalent molecular weight calculations are performed using Viscotek TriSEC software Version 3,0, Compression Set<br>
Compression set is measm-ed according to ASTM D 395. The sample is prepared by stacking 25.4 nmi diameter round discs of 3.2 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.25 mm thickness imtil a total thickness of 12.7 mm is reached. The discs are cut from 12.7 cm x 12.7 cm compression molded plaques molded with a hot press under the following conditions: zero pressure for 3 min at 190'C, followed by 86 MPa for 2 mm at 190^C, followed by coolmg inside the press with cold running water at 86 MPa.

The pellets are placed between polytetrafluoroethylene sheets, heated at 190 ^'C at 55 psi (380 kPa) for 3 min, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 min, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 min. The film is then cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for 1 min. The compression molded films are used for optical measurements, tensile behavior, recovery, and stress relaxation.<br><br>
Clarity is measured using BYK Gardner Haze-gard as specified in ASTM D 1746,<br>

100% and 300% Hysteresis is determined from cyclic loading to 100% and 300% strains according to ASTM D 1708 with an InstronTM instrument The sample is loaded and unloaded at 267 % min'-1 for 3 cycles at 21°C. Cyclic experhnents at 300% and 80°C are conducted using an environmental chamber. In the 80 °C experiment, the sample is allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes at the test temperature before testing. In the 21 °C, 300% strain cyclic experiment, the retractive stress at 150% strain from the first unloading cycle is recorded. Percent recovery for all experiments are calculated from tibe first unloading cycle using the strain at which the load returned to the base line. The percent recovery is defined as:<br><br>
Stress relaxation is measured at 50 percent strain and 37 °C for 12 hours using an InstronTM instrument equipped with an environmental chamber. The gauge geometry was 76 mm x 25 mm x 0.4 rmn. After equilibrating at 37°C for 45 min in the environmental chamber, the sample was stretched to 50% strain at 333% min-1 Stress was recorded as a function of time for 12 hours. The percent stress relaxation after 12 hours was calculated using the formula:<br><br>
Tensile notched tear experiments are carried out on samples having a density of 0.88 g/cc or less using an Instron™ instrument. The geometry consists of a gauge section of 76 mm x 13 mm x 0.4 mm with a 2 mm notch cut into the sample at half the specimen length. The sample is stretched at 508 mm min-1 at 21oC until it breaks. The tear energy is calculated as the area under the stress-elongation curve up to strain at maximum load. An average of at least 3 specimens are reported.<br><br>
TMA<br>
Thermal Mechanical Analysis is conducted on 30mm diameter x 3.3 mm thick, compression molded discs, formed at 180X and 10 MPa molding pressure for 5 minutes and then air quenched. The instrument used is a TMA 7, brand available from Perkin-Elmer. In the test, a probe with 1.5 mm radius tip (P/N N519-0416) is applied to the surface of the sample disc with IN force. The temperature is raised at 5°C/min from 25°C. The probe penetration distance is measured as a function of temperature. The experiment ends when the probe has penetrated 1 mm into the sample. DMA<br>
Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is measured on compression molded disks formed in a hot press at 180°C at 10 MPa pressure for 5 minutes and then water cooled in the press at 90°C / min. Testing is conducted using an ARES controlled strain rheometer (TA instruments) equipped with dual cantilever fixtures for torsion testing.<br>
A 1.5mm plaque is pressed and cut in a bar of dimensions 32xl2mm. The sample is clamped at both ends between fixtures separated by 10mm (grip separation AL) and subjected to successive temperature steps from -100°C to 200°C (5°C per step). At each temperature the torsion modulus G' is measured at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s, the stram amplitude being maintained between 0.1 percent and 4 percent to ensure that the torque is sufficient and that the measurement remains in the linear regime.<br>
An initial static force of 10 g is maintained (auto-tension mode) to prevent slack in the sample when thermal expansion occurs. As a consequence, the grip separation AL increases with the temperature, particularly above the melting or softening point of the polymer sample. The test stops at the maximum temperature or when the gap between the fixtures reaches 65 mm. Pellet Blocking Behavior<br>
Pellets (150 g) are loaded into a 2" (5 cm) diameter hollow cylinder that is made of two halves held together by a hose clamp. A 2.75 lb (1.25 kg) load is applied to the pellets in the cylinder at 45 °C for 3 days. After 3 days, the pellets loosely consolidate mto a cylindrical shaped plug. The plug is removed from the form and the pellet blocking force measured by loading the cylinder of blocked pellets in compression using an InstronTM instrument to measure the compressive force needed to break the cylinder into pellets. Melt Properties<br>
Melt Flow Rate (MFR) and Melt index, or I2 are measured m accordance with ASTM D1238, Condition 190°C/2.16kg,<br><br>
ATREF<br>
Analytical temperature rising elution fractionation (ATREF) analysis is conducted according to the method described m U.S. Patent 4,798,081. The composition to be analyzed is dissolved in trichlorobenzene and allowed to crystallize in a column containing an inert support (stainless steel shot) by slowly reducing the temperature to 20 °C at a cooling rate of 0.1 'C/min. The column is equipped with an infrared detector. An ATREF chromatogram curve is then generated by eluting the crystallized polymer sample from the column by slowly increasing the temperature of the eluting solvent (trichlorobenzene) from 20 to 120 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C/min.<br>

General High Throughput Parallel Polymerization Conditions<br>
Polymerizations are conducted using a high throughput, parallel polymerization reactor (PPR) available from Symyx technologies, Inc. and operated substantially according to U.S. Patents 6,248,540, 6,030,917,6,362,309, 6,306,658, and 6,316,663. Ethylene copolymerizations are conducted at 130 'oC and 80 psi (550 kPa) with ethylene on demand usinig 1.2 equivalents of cocatalyst 2 based on total catalyst used. A series of polymerizations are conducted in a parallel pressure reactor (PPR) comprised of 48 individual reactor cells in a 6 x 8 array that are fitted with a pre-weighed glass tube. The working volume in each reactor cell is 6000μL. Each cell is temperature and pressure controlled with stirring provided by individual stirring paddles. The monomer gas and quench gas (air) are plumbed directly into the PPR unit and controlled by automatic valves. Liquid reagents are robotically added to each reactor cell by syringes and the reservoir solvent is mixed alkanes. The order of addition is mixed alkanes solvent (4 ml), ethylene, 1-octene comonomer (143 mg), 0.419 pmol cocatalyst, shuttling agent in the indicated amounts, and finally, 0.3495 pmol catalyst A3. After quenching, the reactors are cooled and the glass tubes are unloaded. The tubes are transferred to a centrifuge/vacuum drying unit, and dried for 12 hours at 60 °C. The tubes containing dried polymer are weighed and the difference between this weight and the tare weight gives the net yield of polymer. Results are contained in Table 1.<br><br>
Catalyst/ Shuttling Agent Selection Method 1<br>
A series of ethylene/ 1-octene polymerizations are conducted using differing monomer conversions and one of two potential chain shuttling agents, t-butyldimethylsiloxydi(isopropyl) aluminum (TSA, Runs A-F) and diethylzinc (DEZ, Runs 1-6), usmg the foregoing high-throughput polymerization technique. The resulting polymers are measured for molecular weight (Mw and Mn) using GPC. Polydispersity Index (PDI=Mw/Mn) is calculated for each polymer. Results are tabulated in Table 1<br><br><br>
It may be seen the polymers produced in Runs 1-6 have a relatively narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn) compared to polymers in the series A-F. This indicates that DEZ is an effective chain shuttling agent under the conditions of the polymerization, whereas TSA is not Polymers prepared in a reactor, especially a loop, semi-batch, or plug flow type reactor, in a manner to expose an active catalyst site to at least two different sets of reaction conditions, especially conditions encompassing differences in monomer/comonomer ratio, would therefore generate polymer products having multiple blocks or segments (pseudo-block copolymers). These polymers would be expected to possess properties resembling pure block copolymers and distinguishable from those of random copolymers of similar gross comonomer content.<br>
Catalyst/ Shuttling Agent Selection Method 2<br>
The previously disclosed high throughput polymerization conditions are substantially repeated using various catalysts, cocatalyst 1, and potential shuttling agents. Ethylene pressure is increased to 200 psi (1.4 MPa). Over 500 reactions are performed. The resulting etliylene/1-octene copolymers are tested for Mn and PDI and polymer production rate compared to rates obtamed from a control using MMAO in place of the shuttling agent. The best compositions are then selected based on a combination of greatest molecular weight (Mn) reduction, greatest reduction in PDI, and least reduction (or actual increase) in polymerization rate. Selected combinations showing the best results (ranked by Mn reduction) are presented in Table 2.<br><br><br>
By reference to Table 2 a suitable combinations of catalyst and shuttling agent may be selected- It is to be emphasized that preferred catalyst/shuttling agent combinations may in different embodiments, be selected based on a desired objective, such as maxunum reduction in Mn or improvement in production rate coupled with more modest Mn reduction. Additionally, the above results are based on a batch reactor, whereas in practice, the effect, if any, of using continuous polymeri2ation conditions must also be considered in selectmg the final combmation of catalysts and shuttling agent(s).<br>
Continuous Solution Polymerization Reactions<br>
Polymer samples according to the invention and comparative polymer examples are prepared in a solution loop reactor using mixed alkanes solvent. Propylene, ethylene, hydrogen,<br><br>
catalyst package, and polymer are dissolved in fee solvent during the polymerization process. Following the polymeri2ation, the catalyst system is deactivated with water. The resulting polymer is separated from the solvent by flashing, or devolatilization, of the solvent. The recovered solvent/propylene mixture is condensed, purified, and recycled to the reactor, operating substantially according to the teachings of U.S. Patents 6,355,741, 5,977,251 or 5,684,097.<br>
Referring to figure 2, the reactor 30, comprises a closed loop of high pressure piping such as a 3" (7.5 cm) diameter, schedule 80 carbon steel pipe equipped with a circulation pump, 32, which circulates the reactor contents (solvent, monomers, catalyst, and polymer) through the piping and associated heat exchangers, 34a and 34b, flow meter, 36, and static mixiing elements, 38a, 38b and 38c. In operative communication with the reactor are mlets 52, for injection of monomer(s) and optionally hydrogen, 54, for injection of catalyst, 56, for injection of cocatalyst and optionally chain transfer agent, and 58, for injection of monomer(s), recycled process solvent (comprising unreacted monomer or comonomer), and optionally hydrogen. Reactor outlet, 50, serves as a port for removal of the reactor contents and is in operative communication with a polymer recovery zone (not shown). After exiting the reactor, polymer is separated from process solvent and umeacted monomers in the recovery zone. Recovered process solvent and unreacted monomer is reinjected into the reactor at inlets 52 or 58, or optionally in varying amounts at both to provide ratios of recycled monomer at the two inlets from 1:99 to 99:1.<br>
During operation, the ethylene and propylene concentrations in different sections of the reactor are varied to create inhomogeneous concentrations or gradients of monomer and comonomer within the reactor. This gradient is established by adjustments to pumping rate, reactor feed splits, changmg of monomer and commoner injection points, and monomer conversions. For example, ethylene is added at a separate injection point from the fresh comonomer addition point in order to create separate regions of differing concentrations of the two monomers, The amount of recycled process solvent injected with the ethylene may also be minimized in order to maximize the monomer/ comonomer molar ratio near the injection point of the reactor. In certain experiments, reduced pumping rates are also employed to decrease reactor mixing and maximize ethylene inhomogeneity within the loop reactor.<br>
For the comparative examples, no chain shuttling agent is employed in combination with a poorly mixed reactor to create blends of polymers having higher and lower crystallinity contents. For the examples according to the invention, a chain shuttling agent is added. The chain shuttling agent creates a fraction of polymer molecules containing segments of polymer made in both ethylene rich and ethylene poor regions of the reactor. In one embodiment of the invention, the chain shuttling agent is injected near to the point of lowest ethylene concentration, thereby resulting<br><br>
in the generation of a higher concentration of polymer in which the chain ends comprise higher crystallinity (low ethylene content) polymer. Results are provided in Tables 3,4 and 5. Examples 1-6. Comparative examples A-B.<br>
Examples 1-6 and comparative examples A and B are carried out with the following reagents and conditions: catalyst Al, cocatalyst 1, chain shuttling agent, SAl (DEZ), polymerization temperature, 105 °C, reactor pressure, 540 psig (3.7 MPa), total solvent flow, 1003 pounds/hour (455 kg/hr), propylene conversion, 64 percent, solution density, 41 Ib/tf (656 kg/M3), and percent solids in reactor, 19 percent. Additional process details are as follows:<br>
Comparative A. The reactor is configured with all the ethylene entermg the reactor at one point. No chain shuttling agent is employed. An 8 percent ethylene content propylene/ ethylene copolymer is prepared having a melt flow rate of approximately 8 dg/min.<br>
Example 1. Chain shuttling agent SAl is introduced into the reactor while mmntaining the reactor at a constant log(viscosity) the same as for the 8MFR resin produced in Comparative A and discontinumg hydrogen addition. The resulting resm, on hydrolysis of the feed stream, exhibits a MFR of approxhnately 14. The discrepancy between measured reactor viscosity or molecular weight and ultimate product molecular weight indicates the presence of some fraction of (polymer)2Zn species in the reactors thereby indicating that chain shuttling is occurring in the reactor.<br>
Example 2. The reaction conditions of Example 1 are altered by reducing the flow of chain shuttling agent until a product having a melt flow rate of 8 dg/min is obtained.<br>
Example 3. The reaction conditions of Example 2 are altered by reducing the pumping rate to maximize the ethylene gradient in the reactor while still ensuring that the reactor contents remained soluble in the diluent. The other flows are maintained as in example 2. The resulting polymer has a measured MFR of approximately 5.<br>
Example 4. The reaction conditions of Example 3 are altered by increasing the flow of chain shuttling agent until a product having a measured melt flow rate of approximately 8 is again obtained.<br>
Example 5. The reaction conditions of Example 4 are altered by increasing the ethylene flow to produce a target polymer comprising approximately 15 percent polymerized ethylene. The chain shuttle agent flow is maintained at the same level but the hydrogen flow to the reactor is increased in order to maintain a product having approximately 8 MFR.<br>
Example 6. The reaction conditions of Example 5 are altered by increasing ethylene flow thereby producing a product having an ethylene content of approximately 20 percent.<br><br>
Comparative B. The reaction conditions of Example 6 are altered by stopping the flow of chain shuttling agent and increasing hydrogen flow in order to produce a copolymer having a MFR of approximately 8 dg/min. while maintaining an ethylene content of 20 percent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
