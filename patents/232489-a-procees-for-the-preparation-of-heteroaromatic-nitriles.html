				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HETREROAROMATIC NITRILES, IMPROVED CATALYST THEREFOR AND A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SAID IMPROVED CATALYST<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a heteroaromatic nitrile by amoxidation of a corresponding alkyl-substituted pyridine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the production of a heteroaromatic nitrile comprising reacting the corresponding alkyl-substituted pyridine with ammonia and molecular oxygen in gaseous phase over an improved catalyst. The present invention also relates to such improved catalyst for use in the production of heteroaromatic nitriles and to a process for the preparation thereof. Background of the invention<br>
Cyanopyridines have acquired tremendous importance in recent years since they form the starting materials for a number of valuable pharmaceutical intermediates and other<br><br>
commodities.<br>
For catalyzing ammoxidation of an alkyl substituted heteroaromatic compound such as alkyl pyridines, several catalysts comprising vanadium oxides have been used. However, conventional catalysts possess very strong catalytic activity rendering them unsuitable for the ammoxidation of alkyl substituted pyridines. As a result of the strong catalytic activity of conventional catalysts, dealkylation or cleavage of the heteroaromatic ring occurs thereby resulting in low yields and low selectivity of the desired nitriles.<br>
It is, therefore, important and essential to develop a catalyst for the ammoxidation of alkyl substituted heteroaromatic compound, which provides good yield and selectivity for the desired nitriles. Discussion of prior art<br>
Several processes are reported in the art for the catalytic ammoxidation of alkyl substituted heteroaromatic compounds to their corresponding nitriles. US Patent No. 2,510,605 discloses a catalyst containing vanadium, molybdenum and phosphorous with alumina as a carrier for the ammoxidation of picolines. Yields are reported to be approximately 60 % at 450°C. The high reaction temperature in this reference is unsuitable from the industrial production point of view. European Patent No. 0253360 discloses vanadium, phosphorous and antimony oxides in combination as catalyst for the ammoxidation at a reaction temperature in the range of 420 - 430°C. Again, the high operating temperature is a serious limitation in terms of industrial operation. US Patent No.<br><br>
5,910,465 discloses the ammoxidation of picolines over a multi-component catalyst comprising of vanadium, phosphorous, titanium or aluminium oxide with or without bismuth oxide. The catalyst is reduced at 450°C before the reactants are passed over the catalyst.<br>
US Patent No. 3,970,657 discloses the use of V2O5 + MoO3 + P2O5 + MnSO4 with titanium dioxide. The conversion level of 3-picoline claimed in this disclosure is in the range of 52% and selectivity of upto 83%. The low conversion and selectivity levels render this process unattractive.<br>
US Patent No. 2,839,535 discloses several V2O5 catalyst supported on A12O3, heated at different temperatures and a process yield of 80 % and 74 % for isonicotinonitrile and nicotinonitrile respectively. US Patent No. 2,861,999 discloses similar yields for isonicotinonitrile and nicotinonitrile in the presence of large excess of air over a catalyst comprising oxides of vanadium, molybdenum and phosphorous supported on activated alumina. US Patent No. 5,658,844 discloses the use of vanadium antimony silica and titanium dioxide with one or more alkali metals.<br>
European Patent No. 0037123 discloses a catalyst comprising vanadium, antimony and uranium or chromium oxides mixed with fine powder alumina. The catalyst needs a calcination temperature of 1300°C, rendering the process of catalyst preparation unattractive. The reference also recommends a very high mole ratio of air above 90 mole% per mole of beta picoline. This is also another disadvantage since it results in very high uncondensable gaseous effluent.<br>
It is well known that transition metal oxides are good catalysts for selective oxidation and ammoxidation. A common characteristic of such oxides due to their ionic nature is the ability to transform bulk oxygen to the surface and later therefrom to the reactant molecules absorbed on it. The reduced catalyst is then rapidly reoxidised by molecular oxygen coming from the gas phase.<br>
It is also important to consider here that ammoxidation reactions of alkyl-substituted heterocycles  to  produce  corresponding  heterocyclic   aromatic  nitriles   are   exothermic reactions. Thus, equilibrium conversion at low temperatures of exothermic reactions is desired. Objects of the invention<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a process for the production of heteroaromatic nitriles by the ammoxidation of corresponding alkyl-substituted pyridine derivatives, which ensures higher equilibrium conversion at lower temperatures of exothermic reactions to obtain better selectivities.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the production of heteroaromatic nitriles by the ammoxidation of the corresponding alkyl-substituted pyridine derivatives over an improved catalyst, which results in higher yield and selectivities.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved catalyst for the ammoxidation of alkyl - substituted pyridine derivatives to corresponding heteroaromatic nitriles which provides better yields and selectivities.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of an improved catalyst for use in the ammoxidation of alkyl-substituted pyridine derivatives to corresponding heteroaromatic nitriles Summary of the invention<br>
After extensive study and analysis, the applicants have found that in the preparation of cyanopyridines by the ammoxidation of alkyl pyridines, the abnormal reactions can be suppressed and nitriles obtained in good yield and selectivity when the catalyst of the present invention is used in the presence of a carefully selected promoter. In such reaction, the molar ratio of molecular oxygen and ammonia is also important. The catalyst of the invention comprises oxides of vanadium and antimony.

The following examples are mustrative of the invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner. It is understood that variations of the processes described below are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br><br>
PREPARATION OF CATALYST Example 1:<br>
Oxalic acid 1.0 kg was taken in 6 1tr. DM Water in an SS vessel with a mechanical stirrer. Vanadium pentoxide 500 gms. were added under stirring. Heating was slowly started at 70 - 80°C. Antimony oxide 300 gms. were added followed by chromium 150 gms. The mixture was heated to 90 - 80°C to concentrate the solution till thick slurry was obtained. The support 5.0 kg. in the form of 3 - 4 mm pellets were added to the above slurry under constant agitation and heating was continued. The coated thick mass obtained was carefully dried at 150 - 170°C. The dried mass was then slowly calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 -500°C for 5 hours. The calcined mass was sieved to remove the powder and loosely held ingredients. The final preparation was examined and analysed to determine the amount of active material present on the support. If desired, repeated coatings can be carried out to ensure necessary percentage loading on the support material of the active ingredients. The coated mass thus obtained is between 10-20 % by weight of the support. For the best results, the active material over the carrier should be between 3-35% preferably between 8 -25% by weight. Example 2<br>
The  same procedure as  in Example   1   was  followed  except that ammonium metavanadate was used in instead of vanadium pentoxide. Calcination was carried out at 500 - 525°C and the active component over the support was 15%. Example 3<br>
Example 2 was repeated using high fired silica of very low surface area and the active component coating obtained was approximately 16.5%. Example 4<br>
Example 1 was repeated where vanadium, antimony and the third component ratio was maintained at the level of 1:0.8:0.15 respectively. The catalyst was calcined at 600°C and the coating obtained was 12%.<br>
The catalysts prepared in the above-mentioned examples were individually used in the preparation of cyanopyridines from methyl pyridines and satisfactory results were obtained.<br>
The following procedure was adopted for evaluating the catalyst and optimizing the process parameters. The alkyl pyridines were vaporized at 275 - 425°C in a preheater and the superheated vapors were allowed to pass over a catalyst bed maintained at a temperature in<br><br>
the range of 350 - 425°C. Ammonia and air are allowed to enter and mix with the picolines above the catalyst bed.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a stainless steel reactor with 1 meter length and 23 mm ID mounted in a vertical zone tubular furnace. Catalyst was diluted with inert and packed in the reactor. Above the catalyst bed, packing of inert material such as porcelain or glass beads were placed to ensure proper distribution of the reactants. The reactor tube is heated and the temperature is maintained as per the requirement. The feeder line is provided with three attachments, first for air, second for ammonia, and the third for the alkyl pyridines. The first zone of the reactor tube packed with inert acts as a vaporizer and super heater. Condenser traps and heater scrubbers are attached to the bottom outlet of the reactor in order to quench the product as soon as they exit the catalyst bed. Temperature of these condensers is maintained below 10°C by the circulation of chilled brine.<br>
The process of the invention for the preparation of heteroaromatic nitriles is illustrated below with reference to the following examples. Example 5<br>
A run was carried out following the procedure described above and keeping the mole ratio of the reactants picoline: ammonia: air as 1:5:80 using the catalyst of Example 1. Results are provided in Table 1 below: Table 1:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 6<br>
The same procedure as in Example 5 was followed except that the catalyst used was that obtained in Example 2. The results are provided in Table 2 below: Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 7<br>
The catalyst used was that obtained in Example 4 and the molar ratios of the reactants was beta picoline: ammonia: air = 1:2:80 and the effect of varying the percentage of coating over the inert carrier was studied. Results obtained are provided in Table 3 below: Table 3:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 8<br>
Catalyst and conditions mentioned in example 6 above were scaled upto 5 times using beta picoline as reactant. The life of the catalyst in terms of commercial suitability was assessed. The results are provided in Table 4 below. Table 4:<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
The catalyst performed exceptionally well and without any deviation in the activity for 1000 hours of continuous run. Based on the above, it is evident that the catalyst life of the catalyst of the invention is high and steady results are obtained at commercial level.<br>
It was also observed in all the above experiments that the side products formed in the prior art due to the dealkylation of ring and ring destruction are suppressed and a high yield of cyanopyridines are obtained when the molar ratio of the alkyl pyridines, air and ammonia are maintained in a specific range and the improved catalyst of the invention is used.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
