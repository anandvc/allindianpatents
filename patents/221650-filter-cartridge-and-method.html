				<td>FILTER CARTRIDGE WITH STRAP AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a filter cartridge. In particular, the present invention relates to a retention strap for the filter cartridge and method of manufacturing the filter cartridge with the retention strap.<br>
Filter cartridges that have pleated filtration media for filtering particulates from a participate laden fluid stream moving in one direction through the filter cartridge are known. â€¢Such a filter cartridge is often subjected to cleaning fluid pulses moving for short periods of time through the filtration media in a direction opposite to the direction that the particulate laden fluid stream moves. Such a filter cartridge is typically referred to as a pleated filter cartridge utilized in lieu of bags found in baghouses. Known retention straps encircle portions of the pulse pleat filter cartridge to prevent the filtration media from excessive movement during exposure to the cleaning fluid pulses.<br>
However, the known retention straps for pulse pleat filter cartridges have drawbacks because they are difficult to install onto a filter cartridge and may not remain in the relative axial location in which they are initially placed. For example, a known textile retention strap must be manually wrapped about the filtration media of the filter cartridge. The textile retention strap is typically tightened manually and the ends of the retention strap are overlapped. The ends of the retention strap are then adhered or fastened together while a desired tension is manually maintained on the retention strap.<br>
It is important that the retention strap remain in a desired relative axial location along the filter cartridge to assure that the strap properly protect the filtration media from excessive movement during exposure to the cleaning fluid pulses. This is typically accomplished by the use of an adhesive. However, such an adhesive secured, axial location device has been<br>
known to fail and the strap may become incorrectly positioned" aikiaTlyTJoiif fhe"EHef cartridge<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is embodied in a filter cartridge 20 (FIGS. 1 and 2) for removing particulates from a particulate laden fluid stream moving one direction through the filter cartridge. The filter cartridge 20 is particularly suitable for use in air pollution control applications. The filter cartridge 20 is a pleated type of filter cartridge that is periodically subject to pulsed cleaning fluid moving in an opposite direction to the direction that the particulate laden fluid stream moves, as is known. Such a filter cartridge 20 may be subjected to over 300,000 cleaning pulses per year over a typical expected service life of about two years. The filter cartridge 20 is operably attached to a tube sheet 22 (FIG. 2) in a plenum (not shown) of a known baghouse (not shown).<br>
The filter cartridge 20 includes filtration media 24 tE5t is Tormea SfcTa generally tubular or cylindrical configuration, as illustrated in FIGS. 1,3 and 4, with a longitudinal central axis A; The filtration media 24 has a plurality of pleats 26 which are circumferentially spaced about the circumference of the filter cartridge 20. Each pleat 26 has a tip 42 formed at its radially outermost location, as viewed in FIGS. 1,3 and 4, and a pair of sides 44 extending radially inward from me tip. The pleats 26 in the filtration media 24 are not necessarily stiff and strong; thus, the pleats are prone to radially outward movement during a cleaning fluid pulse. It is believed that excessive radial outward movement of the filtration media 24 can damage the filtration effectiveness of the filter cartridge 20 and that adjacent pleats 26 may also "collapse" and temporarily engage one another during a cleaning pulse or during a filtration cycle. When adjacent pleats 26 engage one another, there is a chance mat the cleaning pulse or filtration operation will not be as effective as it should be because gas flow through that portion of the filtration media 24 can be temporarily blocked. Thus, it is desirable to prevent excessive radial movement of the filtration media 24 and collapse of the pleats 26.<br>
Mounting structure 62 (FIGS. 1-2) is located at a first axial end portion of the filtration media 24 and filter cartridge 20. The mounting structure 62 is made of an elastomeric material for mounting and sealing the filter cartridge 20 in an opening 64 (FIG. 2) in the tube sheet 22. A known suitable material for the mounting structure 62 is preferably made from a molded urethane material. An end cap 66 is located at an axially opposite second axial end portion of the filtration media 24 and filter cartridge 20. The end cap 66 is preferably made from a molded urethane material. The filtration media 24 is potted in potting compounds and maintained in the generally tubular configuration by the mounting structure 62 and the end cap 66. A permeable support 68 is located radially inward of the<br>
filtration media 24 to prevent inward collapse or toe miration mecua~24 during expOSureTo " the particulate laden fluid stream that is to be filtered.<br>
The filter cartridge 20 also includes a retention device in the form of a plurality of retention straps 82, constructed according the present invention. Numerous types of filter cartridges 20 may utilize retention straps 82 constructed in accordance with the present invention even though one specific type of filter cartridge 20, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. RE 37,163, reissued on May 8,2001 to Oussoren et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, is illustrated herein as a nonbmiting example. Another illustrative, but nonlimiting, example of a filter cartridge 20 includes that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,746,792, issued on May 5,1998 to Clements et al., which is also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The retention straps 82 limit radial movement of the filtration media 24 in the radially outward direction, opposite to the flow of the fluid stream to be filtered, when subjected to the periodical cleaning fluid. The retention straps 82 also serve to space apart and maintain adjacent pleats 42 spaced apart around the circumference of the filter cartridge 20. More importantly, the retention straps 82 prevent excessive outward movement of the pleats 26, which could result in the over-flexing of the filtration media 24 and the overstressing at the point of encapsulation of the pleated, filtration media 24 in the potting compounds. This excessive movement could result in a premature failure of the filter cartridge 20.<br>
Each retention strap 82 embodying the present invention is preferably made from a thermoplastic, polyester, elastomeric material having sufficient strength and fatigue resistance to prevent excessive radial movement of the filtration media 24 during a cleaning pulse and maintain the pleats 26 spaced apart. The retention strap 82 is also capable of withstanding the elevated operating temperatures and operating environment, such as<br>
exposure to moisture and chemical degrauauuu, wai mo uiicr cannuge AU is typicauy exposed to and designed for.<br>
The material of the retention strap 82 is selected for its strength and impact resistance at the relatively elevated operating temperatures that the retention strap 82 is exposed. The material of the retention strap 82 is also selected for its resistance to chemical and moisture degradation of its strength and impact resistance. The preferred polyester material meets these design parameters. Initial testing has shown mat the strap can withstand over 150,000 cleaning pulses and function while constantly exposed to heat up to about 130 degrees Celsius, without losing its strength and without moving axially along the filter cartridge from the initial position.<br>
The retention strap 82 engages and is adhered to at least some tips 42 and perhaps some of the sides 44 of pleats 26 of the filtration media 24, as illustrated in FIG. 3. The engagement minimizes radially outward movement of the tips 42 of the pleats 26 and mat the pleats are maintained spaced apart without collapsing against one another during exposure to the pressure and flow of the cleaning fluid or the particulate laden air. The adherence assures that the retention strap 82 remains in the relative axial location it was originally placed in throughout its service life.<br>
The retention strap 82 can be made from any suitable material. However, extruded polyester material is preferred with the optimal form of polyester material being thermoplastic, polyester, elastomers.

An illustrative, but nonlimiting example, includes HYTRELÂ® 10MS available from E. L Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, having a place of business at 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898. A preferred percentage of hydrolytic stabilizer in the thermoplastic, polyester, elastomer compound is in a range from about 2.0 volume % to about 12.0 volume % and more preferably in a range from about 5.0 volume % to about 10 volume % and optimally in a range from about 9.0 volume % to about 9.5 volume %.<br>

The retention strap 82 is preferably applied to the filter cartridge during an extrusion Operation. The retention strap 82 is adhered to the filtration media 24 during the extrusion operation so it does not move along the filter cartridge in a direction parallel to the axis A. During the extrusion operation, the retention strap 82 has portions 84 (PIG. 3) which are forced to extend at least partially into the region between adjacent pleats 26. This assures that there is some structure located between the pleats 26 that prevent adjacent pleats from engaging each other. The retention strap 82 is also forced to engage and adhere to tips 42 and/or sides 44 of the pleats 26 to assure that the retention strap remains in the axial position it was originally applied to the filter cartridge 20. Once the material of the retention strap 82 "cures", it has a hardness and strength sufficient to withstand the operating environment it will be exposed to for its service life and adheres to the filtration media 24.<br>
The retention strap 82 according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention further includes a reinforcement structure 86 (FIG. 4). The reinforcement structure 86 may be any suitable material but is contemplated to be textile reinforcement. The reinforcement structure 86 is introduced during the extrusion operation. The reinforcement structure 86 may be introduced during a single extrusion pass and forced into the extrudate or introduced between two separate extrusion passes.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method ofrfekSrig the retention strap 82, as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. The method includes an extruder 102, a pivotable application roller 104, a cutoff mechanism 106 and an optional reinforcement applicator (not shown). The method of the present invention is described below.<br>
A filter cartridge 20, without any retention device, is held in proximity to the extruder 102 by a support mechanism 122. The support mechanism 122 is adapted to hold and rotate the filter cartridge 20 during the application of an extruded retention strap 82. The support mechanism 122 includes a mounting structure holder 124 and an end cap holder 126. The mounting structure holder 124 closely fits within and supports the mounting structure 62 of the filter cartridge 20. The end cap holder 126 supports the end cap 66 of the filter cartridge 20, The support mechanism 122 positions the filter cartridge 20 so the longitudinal central axis A of the filter cartridge extends in a direction normal to a barrel 142 of the extruder 102. Either or both of the holders 124 or 126 are operably connected with a drive mechanism (not shown) to rotate the supported filter cartridge 20 under the barrel 142 of the extruder 102, in a clockwise direction as illustrated by the arrow R in FIG. S. Preferably, the extruder 102 heats the extrudate 144 in a range from about 215 degrees Celsius to about 288 degrees Celsius and more preferably in a range from about 232 degrees Celsius to about 265.5 degrees Celsius and optimally at 260 degrees Celsius. Preferably, the extruder 102 applies pressure to the extrudate 144 in a range from about 21 kilograms of force/square centimeter to about 84.4 kilograms of force/square centimeter and more preferably in a range from about 35.2 kilograms of force/square centimeter to about 70.3 kilograms of force/square centimeter and optimally at 63.28 kilograms of force/square centimeter<br>
The filter cartridge 20 is rotated under the barret 142 of the extruder 102 while a band ctrudate 144 is applied to the outer surface the filter cartridge 20. The head of the barrel 142 includes a cooling feature that shapes and forms the extrudate 144 as it leaves the<br>
extruder 102. The application roller 104 is loaded to a prwietertflinecridTce so me portions 84 of the uncured extrudate 144 is forced between adjacent pleats 26 of the filtration media 24. The application roller 104 also forces the extrodate 144 to contact tips 42 and sides 44 of leats 26 to engage and adhere the retention strap 82 to the nitration media 24.<br>
Preferably, but not necessarily, the filter cartridge 20 is rotated under the barrel 142 of tie extruder 102 at least twice for two (2) rotations while a first layer of extrudate 144 is ipplied to the outer surface the filter cartridge 20 that is depressed within the plurality of &gt;leats 26 followed by a second layer of extrudate 144 on top of the first layer of extrudate [44. The extrudate 144, preferably at least two (2) layers thereof, are fused together and then allowed to cure to form the retention strap 82. This performs the important function of Keeping the pleats 46 from inverting.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, reinforcement structure 84 may be introduced into the retention strap 82. Textile reinforcement 84 is paid off the optional reinforcement applicator. The textile reinforcement 84 is introduced into the extrudate 144. The application roller 104 forces the textile reinforcement 84 into the extrudate 144. Optionally, the textile reinforcement 84 could be placed between two separate layers of extrudate 144.<br>
When circumferentially opposite ends of the extrudate 144 overlap, the cutoff mechanism 106 is activated to sever the extrudate 144. The application roller 104 then creates a unified one-piece retention strap 82 that remains in its axial relative place and supports the pleats 26 and prevents engagement between adjacent pleats 46.<br>

FILTER CARTRIDGE WITH STRAP AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a filter cartridge. In particular, the present invention relates to a retention strap for the filter cartridge and method of manufacturing the filter cartridge with the retention strap.<br>
Filter cartridges that have pleated filtration media for filtering particulates from a participate laden fluid stream moving in one direction through the filter cartridge are known. â€¢Such a filter cartridge is often subjected to cleaning fluid pulses moving for short periods of time through the filtration media in a direction opposite to the direction that the particulate laden fluid stream moves. Such a filter cartridge is typically referred to as a pleated filter cartridge utilized in lieu of bags found in baghouses. Known retention straps encircle portions of the pulse pleat filter cartridge to prevent the filtration media from excessive movement during exposure to the cleaning fluid pulses.<br>
However, the known retention straps for pulse pleat filter cartridges have drawbacks because they are difficult to install onto a filter cartridge and may not remain in the relative axial location in which they are initially placed. For example, a known textile retention strap must be manually wrapped about the filtration media of the filter cartridge. The textile retention strap is typically tightened manually and the ends of the retention strap are overlapped. The ends of the retention strap are then adhered or fastened together while a desired tension is manually maintained on the retention strap.<br>
It is important that the retention strap remain in a desired relative axial location along the filter cartridge to assure that the strap properly protect the filtration media from excessive movement during exposure to the cleaning fluid pulses. This is typically accomplished by the use of an adhesive. However, such an adhesive secured, axial location device has been<br>
known to fail and the strap may become incorrectly positioned" aikiaTlyTJoiif fhe"EHef cartridge<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is embodied in a filter cartridge 20 (FIGS. 1 and 2) for removing particulates from a particulate laden fluid stream moving one direction through the filter cartridge. The filter cartridge 20 is particularly suitable for use in air pollution control applications. The filter cartridge 20 is a pleated type of filter cartridge that is periodically subject to pulsed cleaning fluid moving in an opposite direction to the direction that the particulate laden fluid stream moves, as is known. Such a filter cartridge 20 may be subjected to over 300,000 cleaning pulses per year over a typical expected service life of about two years. The filter cartridge 20 is operably attached to a tube sheet 22 (FIG. 2) in a plenum (not shown) of a known baghouse (not shown).<br>
The filter cartridge 20 includes filtration media 24 tE5t is Tormea SfcTa generally tubular or cylindrical configuration, as illustrated in FIGS. 1,3 and 4, with a longitudinal central axis A; The filtration media 24 has a plurality of pleats 26 which are circumferentially spaced about the circumference of the filter cartridge 20. Each pleat 26 has a tip 42 formed at its radially outermost location, as viewed in FIGS. 1,3 and 4, and a pair of sides 44 extending radially inward from me tip. The pleats 26 in the filtration media 24 are not necessarily stiff and strong; thus, the pleats are prone to radially outward movement during a cleaning fluid pulse. It is believed that excessive radial outward movement of the filtration media 24 can damage the filtration effectiveness of the filter cartridge 20 and that adjacent pleats 26 may also "collapse" and temporarily engage one another during a cleaning pulse or during a filtration cycle. When adjacent pleats 26 engage one another, there is a chance mat the cleaning pulse or filtration operation will not be as effective as it should be because gas flow through that portion of the filtration media 24 can be temporarily blocked. Thus, it is desirable to prevent excessive radial movement of the filtration media 24 and collapse of the pleats 26.<br>
Mounting structure 62 (FIGS. 1-2) is located at a first axial end portion of the filtration media 24 and filter cartridge 20. The mounting structure 62 is made of an elastomeric material for mounting and sealing the filter cartridge 20 in an opening 64 (FIG. 2) in the tube sheet 22. A known suitable material for the mounting structure 62 is preferably made from a molded urethane material. An end cap 66 is located at an axially opposite second axial end portion of the filtration media 24 and filter cartridge 20. The end cap 66 is preferably made from a molded urethane material. The filtration media 24 is potted in potting compounds and maintained in the generally tubular configuration by the mounting structure 62 and the end cap 66. A permeable support 68 is located radially inward of the<br>
filtration media 24 to prevent inward collapse or toe miration mecua~24 during expOSureTo " the particulate laden fluid stream that is to be filtered.<br>
The filter cartridge 20 also includes a retention device in the form of a plurality of retention straps 82, constructed according the present invention. Numerous types of filter cartridges 20 may utilize retention straps 82 constructed in accordance with the present invention even though one specific type of filter cartridge 20, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. RE 37,163, reissued on May 8,2001 to Oussoren et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, is illustrated herein as a nonbmiting example. Another illustrative, but nonlimiting, example of a filter cartridge 20 includes that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,746,792, issued on May 5,1998 to Clements et al., which is also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The retention straps 82 limit radial movement of the filtration media 24 in the radially outward direction, opposite to the flow of the fluid stream to be filtered, when subjected to the periodical cleaning fluid. The retention straps 82 also serve to space apart and maintain adjacent pleats 42 spaced apart around the circumference of the filter cartridge 20. More importantly, the retention straps 82 prevent excessive outward movement of the pleats 26, which could result in the over-flexing of the filtration media 24 and the overstressing at the point of encapsulation of the pleated, filtration media 24 in the potting compounds. This excessive movement could result in a premature failure of the filter cartridge 20.<br>
Each retention strap 82 embodying the present invention is preferably made from a thermoplastic, polyester, elastomeric material having sufficient strength and fatigue resistance to prevent excessive radial movement of the filtration media 24 during a cleaning pulse and maintain the pleats 26 spaced apart. The retention strap 82 is also capable of withstanding the elevated operating temperatures and operating environment, such as<br>
exposure to moisture and chemical degrauauuu, wai mo uiicr cannuge AU is typicauy exposed to and designed for.<br>
The material of the retention strap 82 is selected for its strength and impact resistance at the relatively elevated operating temperatures that the retention strap 82 is exposed. The material of the retention strap 82 is also selected for its resistance to chemical and moisture degradation of its strength and impact resistance. The preferred polyester material meets these design parameters. Initial testing has shown mat the strap can withstand over 150,000 cleaning pulses and function while constantly exposed to heat up to about 130 degrees Celsius, without losing its strength and without moving axially along the filter cartridge from the initial position.<br>
The retention strap 82 engages and is adhered to at least some tips 42 and perhaps some of the sides 44 of pleats 26 of the filtration media 24, as illustrated in FIG. 3. The engagement minimizes radially outward movement of the tips 42 of the pleats 26 and mat the pleats are maintained spaced apart without collapsing against one another during exposure to the pressure and flow of the cleaning fluid or the particulate laden air. The adherence assures that the retention strap 82 remains in the relative axial location it was originally placed in throughout its service life.<br>
The retention strap 82 can be made from any suitable material. However, extruded polyester material is preferred with the optimal form of polyester material being thermoplastic, polyester, elastomers.

The retention strap 82 is preferably applied to the filter cartridge during an extrusion Operation. The retention strap 82 is adhered to the filtration media 24 during the extrusion operation so it does not move along the filter cartridge in a direction parallel to the axis A. During the extrusion operation, the retention strap 82 has portions 84 (PIG. 3) which are forced to extend at least partially into the region between adjacent pleats 26. This assures that there is some structure located between the pleats 26 that prevent adjacent pleats from engaging each other. The retention strap 82 is also forced to engage and adhere to tips 42 and/or sides 44 of the pleats 26 to assure that the retention strap remains in the axial position it was originally applied to the filter cartridge 20. Once the material of the retention strap 82 "cures", it has a hardness and strength sufficient to withstand the operating environment it will be exposed to for its service life and adheres to the filtration media 24.<br>
The retention strap 82 according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention further includes a reinforcement structure 86 (FIG. 4). The reinforcement structure 86 may be any suitable material but is contemplated to be textile reinforcement. The reinforcement structure 86 is introduced during the extrusion operation. The reinforcement structure 86 may be introduced during a single extrusion pass and forced into the extrudate or introduced between two separate extrusion passes.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method ofrfekSrig the retention strap 82, as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. The method includes an extruder 102, a pivotable application roller 104, a cutoff mechanism 106 and an optional reinforcement applicator (not shown). The method of the present invention is described below.<br>
A filter cartridge 20, without any retention device, is held in proximity to the extruder 102 by a support mechanism 122. The support mechanism 122 is adapted to hold and rotate the filter cartridge 20 during the application of an extruded retention strap 82. The support mechanism 122 includes a mounting structure holder 124 and an end cap holder 126. The mounting structure holder 124 closely fits within and supports the mounting structure 62 of the filter cartridge 20. The end cap holder 126 supports the end cap 66 of the filter cartridge 20, The support mechanism 122 positions the filter cartridge 20 so the longitudinal central axis A of the filter cartridge extends in a direction normal to a barrel 142 of the extruder 102. Either or both of the holders 124 or 126 are operably connected with a drive mechanism (not shown) to rotate the supported filter cartridge 20 under the barrel 142 of the extruder 102, in a clockwise direction as illustrated by the arrow R in FIG. S. Preferably, the extruder 102 heats the extrudate 144 in a range from about 215 degrees Celsius to about 288 degrees Celsius and more preferably in a range from about 232 degrees Celsius to about 265.5 degrees Celsius and optimally at 260 degrees Celsius. Preferably, the extruder 102 applies pressure to the extrudate 144 in a range from about 21 kilograms of force/square centimeter to about 84.4 kilograms of force/square centimeter and more preferably in a range from about 35.2 kilograms of force/square centimeter to about 70.3 kilograms of force/square centimeter and optimally at 63.28 kilograms of force/square centimeter<br>
The filter cartridge 20 is rotated under the barret 142 of the extruder 102 while a band ctrudate 144 is applied to the outer surface the filter cartridge 20. The head of the barrel 142 includes a cooling feature that shapes and forms the extrudate 144 as it leaves the<br>
extruder 102. The application roller 104 is loaded to a prwietertflinecridTce so me portions 84 of the uncured extrudate 144 is forced between adjacent pleats 26 of the filtration media 24. The application roller 104 also forces the extrodate 144 to contact tips 42 and sides 44 of leats 26 to engage and adhere the retention strap 82 to the nitration media 24.<br>
Preferably, but not necessarily, the filter cartridge 20 is rotated under the barrel 142 of tie extruder 102 at least twice for two (2) rotations while a first layer of extrudate 144 is ipplied to the outer surface the filter cartridge 20 that is depressed within the plurality of &gt;leats 26 followed by a second layer of extrudate 144 on top of the first layer of extrudate [44. The extrudate 144, preferably at least two (2) layers thereof, are fused together and then allowed to cure to form the retention strap 82. This performs the important function of Keeping the pleats 46 from inverting.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, reinforcement structure 84 may be introduced into the retention strap 82. Textile reinforcement 84 is paid off the optional reinforcement applicator. The textile reinforcement 84 is introduced into the extrudate 144. The application roller 104 forces the textile reinforcement 84 into the extrudate 144. Optionally, the textile reinforcement 84 could be placed between two separate layers of extrudate 144.<br>
When circumferentially opposite ends of the extrudate 144 overlap, the cutoff mechanism 106 is activated to sever the extrudate 144. The application roller 104 then creates a unified one-piece retention strap 82 that remains in its axial relative place and supports the pleats 26 and prevents engagement between adjacent pleats 46.<br>
