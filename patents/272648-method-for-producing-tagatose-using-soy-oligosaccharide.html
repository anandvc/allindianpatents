METHOD FOR PRODUCING TAGATOSE USING SOY OLIGOSACCHARIDE<br>
CJ CHEILJEDANG CORPORATION.<br>
a Republic of Korea Company<br>
of 500, Namdaemunro 5-ga,<br>
Jung-gu, Seoul 100-095,<br>
Republic of Korea.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing tagatose using soy oligosaccharide or soluble sugar solution containing the same, more precisely, a method for producing tagatose using galactose which is recovered by selective hydrolysis from soluble oligosaccharide in soy.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Tagatose has the natural sweetness that is hardly distinguished from that of sucrose. The physical properties of tagatose are also very similar to those of sucrose.<br>
  However, the in-taken tagatose is hard to be absorbed in the small intestine, suggesting that it does not affect blood sugar level. Tagatose is also a low caloric sweetener whose calorie is only about 30% of that 0f sucrose.    Tagatose has a<br>
   prebiotic effect accelerating the proliferation of benificial lactobacillus through fermenting by rumen microorganisms. However, this beneficial tagatose is a rare sugar which is not distributed in nature but<br>
 included in diary products or some plants at a very low concentration. To use tagatose as a low caloric functional sweetener, a novel technique is required to mass-produce tagatose from an inexpensive raw material.<br>
 <br>
US Patent NO 5002612 and NO 5078796 describe a method for producing D-tagatose, in which lactose or a lactose-containing material is hydrolyzed into galactose and glucose mixture by using lactase and then glucose is eliminated randomly, followed by chemical isomerization of galactose into tagatose.<br>
US Patent NO 6057135 describes a method for producing tagatose comprising the following steps: obtaining galactose and glucose by hydrolyzing cheese whey or milk; isomerizing the obtained galactose by L-arabinose isomerase; and recycling non-converted compounds after the separation of the products and non-converted compounds by chromatography.<br>
The major raw materials which have been used for the production of tagatose so far are milk processing by-products such as lactose or lactose containing materials. In - the byconversion process that uses lactose or lactose containing materials as a starting material, the production of tagatose should be basically performed by two-step reaction (lactose—&gt; galactose —&gt; tagatose).<br>
DISCLOSURE Technical Problem<br>
 Based on the above facts, the present inventors studied and searched raw materials,<br>
 <br>
except lactose, that contain galactose at a high level among wood and process byproducts that can be provided from nature with a low price. Then, the present inventors confirmed that byproducts of isolated soy protein contained high concentration of galactose, compared with other materials, and then selected those appropriate for chromatography.    As a result, the present inventors completed this<br>
,.„ invention by confirming that soy oligosaccharide obtained from isolated soy protein whey was the raw material that could be actually industrialized. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing<br>
  galactose by selective hydrolysis of soy oligosaccharide or soluble sugar solution containing the same. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for producing<br>
 Itagatose comprising the following steps: obtaining an isomerized product by isomerization of galactose in the hydrolyzed sugar solution via enzyme isomerization; and obtaining tagatose by chromatography.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
To achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a method for producing    galactose by selective hydrolysis of .soy oligosaccharide or soluble sugar solution<br>
 <br>
containing the same as a major component by using alpha-galactosidase.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing tagatose comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
1) hydrolyzing soy oligosaccharide or soluble sugar solution containing the same as a<br>
major component selectively by using alpha-galactosidase; „.2)  isomerizing  galactose  in the hydrolyzed sugar solution by using arabinose<br>
isomerase; and<br>
3) obtaining tagatose by serial separation of the isomerized product by using -chromatography, and recycling galactose.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for producing tagatose, in which the<br>
said step 1) and step 3) are performed simultaneously in the same reactor.<br>
Advantageous Effect<br>
The  present  inventors   developed   an  efficient  method   for  producing  tagatose<br>
-considering the balance  of materials  in each  step  and  equipment  investment.<br>
Particularly, to make the separation by chromatography easy, a novel economic<br>
process taking selective hydrolysis has been established.    Therefore, the present<br>
"invention is useful for the efficient production of tagatose, according to the following<br>
 <br>
steps: obtaining galactose not from the conventional lactose but from soy oligosaccharide and soluble sugar solution containing the same as a major component by selective hydrolysis; and producing tagatose by single chromatography of the sugar solution containing at least 3 different sugars (sucrose, galactose, and tagatose) obtained by isomerization of the above galactose.<br>

 <br>
Best Mode<br>
The present invention provides a method for producing tagatose comprising the following steps:<br>
1)	hydrolyzing soy oligosaccharide or soluble sugar solution containing the same as a<br>
major component selectively by using alpha-galactosidase;<br>
2)	isomerizing of galactose in the hydrolyzed sugar solution by using arabinose isomerase; and<br>
3)	obtaining tagatose by serial separation of the isomerized product by using chromatography, and recycling galactose.<br>
The starting material of the present invention can be soy bean whey, the by-product of<br>
isolated soy protein, soy oligosaccharide originated therefrom, or soluble sugar<br>
solution containing the same as a major component, and soy oligosaccharide is more<br>
preferred.<br>
The sugar included in the soy bean whey is mostly sucrose, raffinose and stachyose,<br>
,and raffinose and stachyose are composed of a polymer in which sucrose and galactose are combined via alpha-1,4 linkage. Carbohydrate components of the said sugars are shown in Table 1.    Each unit component of soy bean whey or soy<br>
 oligosaccharide is sucrose and galactose, or more specifically understood as mixed<br>
 <br>
  monosaccharide comprising glucose, fructose and galactose. Table 1<br>
 <br>
"In most plant materials found in nature including soy bean whey of the present<br>
invention, most of galactose exists in the form of oligosaccharide or carbohydrate with<br>
glucose or fructose. So, the sugar solution obtained therefrom by hydrolysis also<br>
comprises mixed monosaccharide in which at least three different sugars are included.<br>
The conventional by-product derived from milk is mainly composed of lactose alone.<br>
Therefore, when this product is hydrolyzed, mixed monosaccharide comprising<br>
glucose and galactose can be easily obtained initially, which can be economically<br>
separated by advanced chromatography.	,<br>
However, the sugar solution containing at least three different sugars like the one of the present invention is not easy to be separated by chromatography unless selective conditions are fulfilled. That is, it is very difficult to produce galactose or tagatose economically from other raw materials than lactose.<br>
 <br>
In general, separation of sugar by chromatography is performed by taking advantage of difference in weak binding force among metal ions attached on the sugar and ion resin. Particularly, metal ion residues applicable to chromatography for food are limited to K, Na, Ca, and Mg.<br>
; Glucose and galactose are very similar in their physical structures composed of aldose form. Fructose is the sugar composed of ketose form. In general, the separation of mixed sugar composed of aldose form and ketose form is performed economically by<br>
-chromatography using the resin having cation residues, which is actually widely used in starch sugar process. However, to separate glucose and galactose which have same aldose form and similar physical structure, a specific resin having K and Na is<br>
""necessary. That is, galactose is only pure-separated by using two different chromatography equipments in serial. This process is shown in Fig. 1. The separation of mixed sugar by chromatography uses a large amount of water, suggesting that cost for concentration increases and high priced equipment is required. The enzyme used for the hydrolysis of the present invention is a-galactosidase, and more preferably invertase free a-galactosidase.<br>
The said a-galactosidase is one of the natural glycolytic enzymes, which can digest selectively alpha-1,4-linkage between sucrose and galactose composing raffinose or<br>
 <br>
stachyose.    Therefore, it can be used for the preparation of sugar solution composed<br>
	of sucrose  and  galactose  as  major components  from  soy  bean whey  or  soy<br>
oligosaccharide.<br>
However, to produce an enzyme that is industrially applicable, it is general to obtain<br>
.— supernatant by culturing a microorganism producing the enzyme or mycelia thereof, which is then further used as a raw material for the production of the enzyme. In most cases, the material includes the most representative glycolytic enzyme, invertase.<br>
  in this invention, the selective hydrolysis for sucrose and galactose is necessary for the convenience of chromatography. Therefore, invertase free a-galactosidase makes the chromatography easier.<br>
  The said a-galactosidase is originated from the strain that dose not have the invertase gene inside. More preferably, the a-galactosidase may be originated from Mortierella vinaceae var. raffinoseutilizer ATCC 20034 or Absidia griseola ATCC<br>
 20431.        ....	.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, soy oligosaccharide was hydrolyzed with a-galactosidase to obtain the sugar solution containing sucrose and galactose. Pretreatment of selective sucrose crystallization was performed to obtain the sugar solution having reduced sucrose content.    Soy oligosaccharide contained<br>
 <br>
excessive sucrose, so that there were disadvantages for chromatography caused by the increased volume of sugar solution, increased scale of equipment, and increased amount of purified water. Thus, the said pretreatment process of sucrose crystallization could be reduce the utility of the process.<br>
 According to the present invention, a novel technique to produce galactose or tagatose economically by using the sugar solution selectively hydrolyzed with a-galactosidase has been established.    To convert galactose obtained in the present invention to<br>
   tagatose, arabinose isomerase can be used. Preferably,   thermophilic   arabinose   isomerase   originated   from   Sulfurobus   sp., Thermotoga sp., or Geobacillus sp. can be used.    More preferably, thermophilic<br>
z;;arabinose isomerase originated from Thermotoga neapolitana DSM5068 can be used. In this invention, the sugar solution composed of mixed sugar comprising sucrose, galactose, and tagatose obtained by hydrolysis and isomerization is separated by<br>
  chromatography. More preferably, three-phase separation of chromatography is used. In general, phase equilibrium is theoretically presented in reversible reaction such as isomerization  under  the  economical  process  condition,   and  it  is  theoretically<br>
   impossible to convert every substrate to a product. Therefore, in the process like the sugar process, efficient separation and recycling of non-reacted materials using<br>
 <br>
chromatography are necessary.    The other key point of this production technique lies<br>
on the economic execution of chromatography.<br>
In the separation with chromatography, the resin having Ca residue can be used as the<br>
resin for the separation of sugar solution.<br>
In the separation with chromatography, the recycling method of non-reacted materials<br>
can be randomly selected by those in the art considering the kind of sugar solution.<br>
The sugar solution containing tagatose as a major component (at least 90%) can  proceed to crystallization, if necessary, after the concentration of tagatose.<br>
The sugar solution containing galactose as a major component can be recycled<br>
selectively before the crystallization or the isomerization considering the composition    ratio of the sugar solution.<br>
The sugar solution containing sucrose as a major component can be processed through<br>
concentration or crystallization, and then further used as sugar solution or as a raw  material for other productions.<br>
Practical   and  presently  preferred   embodiments   of the   present   invention   are<br>
   illustrative as shown in the following Examples.    However, it will be appreciated<br>
that those  skilled  in the  art,  on  consideration  of this  disclosure,  may  make<br>
 <br>
modifications and improvements within the spirit and scope of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, to obtain possible raw materials for the economic production of galactose or tagatose by chromatography, sugar constituents of industrial by-products were analyzed and evaluated. Then, selective hydrolysis was performed with the selected soy bean whey or soy oligosaccharide by using a-galactosidase to prepare hydrolysate. And at last, the present inventors developed a novel technique for the economic production of galactose or tagatose from the hydrolysate. In particular, the present invention introduced continuous recycling for the above production procedure, leading to the advanced high yield economic production technique.<br>
[n the present invention, the material which was composed largely of carbohydrate and could be easily obtained from the by-products of material processing was selected as the primary raw material for the economic production of tagatose. And then, carbohydrate components, particularly soluble sugar components (including monosaccharide, disaccharide, and oligosaccharide) and contents in the material were inalyzed thoroughly. From which, the present inventors confirmed the utility as a composition suitable for chromatography after being through selective hydrolysis asing an enzyme.<br>
 <br>
Based on the results of the above analysis, it was confirmed that soy bean whey, the by-product of isolated soy protein and soluble sugar solution or soy oligosaccharide originated therefrom had excellent composition appropriate for pure and economic separation of galactose or tagatose. Therefore, the present inventors completed this ,- invention by establishing the production processes of tagatose using the said raw material.<br>
-EXAMPLES Example 1: Analysis of sugar composition of industrial by-product<br>
The commercial soy oligosaccharide was obtained from Chinese market, which was    used as a sample.    HPLC was performed to analyze the composition and the content<br>
of carbohydrate included in the obtained soy oligosaccharide.    The column used<br>
herein, was Supelco-PB sugar separation column (SUPELCO), and purified water  (0.5 ml/min) was used as a moving phase.    HPLC grade reagent (Sigma) was used<br>
as the standard solution.    The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Table 2<br>
Soy oligosaccharide composition<br>
In the carbohydrate composition of soy oligosaccharide, the content ratio of raffinose and stachyose took 73.5% by the total carbohydrate, and sucrose and fructose took ;^.26.5%.    Fig. 2 illustrates HPLC chromatogram of this experiment.<br>
Example  2:  Analysis  of sugar content in  soy oligosaccharide and  enzyme ^hydrolysis<br>
The soy oligosaccharide of example 1 was treated with a-galactosidase for the use as<br>
a galactose source.    The enzyme used at this time was validase (Validase AGS;<br>
"'Valley Research, US) and the concentration of the enzyme was 0.15% (w/w) by the<br>
total volume of the substrate, soy oligosaccharide.    Hydrolysis was performed at 50 D<br>
 <br>
with stirring at the speed of 150 rpm.    The time-dependent galactose production by<br>
hydrolysis with a-galactosidase and the changes of sugar composition are illustrated<br>
in Fig. 3.<br>
Validase decomposed soy oligosaccharide, stachyose, into raffinose and galactose.<br>
The produced raffinose was decomposed again into sucrose and galactose.    The<br>
major component of validase was a-galactosidase.    It is added to feeds, because<br>
when it is added, it decomposes soy oligosaccharide, so that it reduces diarrhea,<br>
abdominal pain, and other side effects caused by soy oligosaccharide intake.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a-galactosidase in the product was functioning to hydrolyze<br>
selectively    galactose/galactose    bond    and    galactose/sucrose    bond    in    soy<br>
...oligosaccharide.    However, invertase activity functioning to decompose sucrose into glucose and fructose was also confirmed. Sucrose was all decomposed in 24 hours, but glucose and fructose were continuously<br>
 generated, This was presumably because of that sucrose produced by the decomposition of stachyose and raffinose was continuously decomposed by invertase in validase with producing glucose and fructose.    After 50 hours of hydrolysis,<br>
 galactose, fructose and glucose were no more generated, and the sugar composition at that time is shown in Table 3.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Example 3: Invertase free a-galactosidase<br>
As described hereinbefore, selective hydrolysis of raffinose or stachyose to sucrose and galactose using an enzyme is essential not only for the convenience of chromatography but also for the economic production of tagatose.    Therefore, a<br>
	technique that facilitates selective cleavage of alpha-1,4 linkage between sucrose and<br>
galactose which compose raffinose or stachyose by using a-galactosidase is needed. However, to produce an enzyme that is industrially applicable, it is general to obtain<br>
   supernatant by culturing a microorganism producing the enzyme or mycelia thereof, which is then further used as a raw material for the production of the enzyme.    The<br>
 <br>
commercialized a-galactosidase on the market is also prepared by using the cultured supernatant of mycelia of Aspergillus niger as a raw material and thus most of the produced enzyme includes invertase in their enzyme solution.<br>
Invertase, the most representative glycolytic enzyme that most living creatures in nature system have, is capable of decomposing sucrose easily. So, invertase included in an enzyme solution can hydrolyze sucrose contained in the sugar solution fast into glucose and fructose, which becomes a major obstacle to the efficient production of tagatose.<br>
Therefore, the present inventors investigated whether or not those cells producing a-galactosidase, in many microorganisms or mycelia found in the nature, could also ^produce invertase, and the result is shown in Table 4.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
In this invention, cultured mycelia of Mortierella vinaceae var. Raffinose utilizer or<br>
Absidia griseola that produced not invertase but a-galactosidase alone was used as<br>
hydrolase.<br>
The invertase free a-galactosidase used in this invention was originated from the<br>
fungus   distributed   from   ATCC,   Mortierella   vinaceae   var.   raffinose   utilizer<br>
ATCC20034 or Absidia griseola ATCC20431.<br>
 The culture medium for the selected strain was composed of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 10 g/1 of lactose, 3 g/1 of peptone, 3 g/1 of yeast extract, 0.5 g/1 of potassium chloride, 0.5 g/1 of magnesium sulfate, and a small amount of ferrous sulfate.    The<br>
— cells were cultured at 30 D for 3 days, followed by collecting the cells using a filter system (CORNING, BOTTLE and BOTTLE TOP FILTERS). The collected cells were   put   in   ice,   followed   by   lysis   using   a   homogenizer   for   10   minutes.<br>
   Centrifugation was performed at 10,000rpm for 10 minutes to obtain the supernatant, the final enzyme solution. Soy oligosaccharide was hydrolyzed by using the enzyme solution obtained above.<br>
 <br>
The reaction was induced at 40 D for 7 hours.    HPLC (SUPELCO, SUPELCOGEL<br>
 Pb HPLC Column) was performed to analyze sugar content.    As a result, it was<br>
confirmed that soy  oligosaccharide was  selectively hydrolyzed to  sucrose and<br>
galactose by the invertase free a-galactosidase, which is displayed in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.<br>
Example 4: Isomerization of galactose to tagatose using L-arabinose isomerase<br>
The isomerization of galactose to tagatose in this invention was performed using thermophilic arabinose isomerase originated from hypertherrnophilic Thermotoga neapolitana DSM 5068, obtained by expressing arabinose isomerase derived from hyperthermophile in Corynebacterium host.<br>
The gene encoding "the arabinose isomerase was inserted in the E.coli-Corynebacterium shuttle vectors pCJ-1 and pCJ-7 (Korean Patent NO. 10-2006-0068505) and finally the host Corynebacterium glutamicum KCTC 13032 was obtained. The strain in which the thermostable enzyme was expressed was mixed with 2.0% sodium alginate solution at the concentration of 20% (w/v), followed by stirring to prepare a suspension. The suspension was dropped in 0.1 M CaCl2 solution by free fall to induce curing reaction. The obtained cell-captured alginate curing bead was used for immobilization.    The sugar solution obtained from the<br>
 <br>
reaction was added with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer to regulate pH thereof,    which was used as a substrate solution. The prepared arabinose isomerase was used for isomerization to obtain the isomerized<br>
product.<br>
Example 5: Analysis of chromatography separation pattern of hydrolyzed mixed monosaccharide<br>
To design a chromatography separation method of galactose using the isomerized product (mixed monosaccharide) obtained from the above example, analysis of chromatography separation pattern was performed.<br>
For the chromatography separation of the mixed monosaccharide, the experiment was performed with the following materials and equipments. The resin for sugar separation was FINEX MFG220 Ca4^ (FINEX). The moving phase was purified ultra pure water (11 ml/min at 60□). Two XK50/100 columns (Ammersham Bioscience, USA) were connected in series. The resin of each column was filled with 1900 ml. The mixed sugar used for the separation was prepared as a sugar solution at the concentration of 50 Bx, which was used by 160 ml at a time. The composition of the primary mixed monosaccharide was sucrose:galactose (80:20) and<br>
 <br>
the composition of the secondary mixed monosaccharide was galactose:tagatose ,,(50:50), followed by analysis of separation patterns.    As a result, it was confirmed that sucrose, galactose, and tagatose were easily separated at a regular interval, which is shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.<br>
Example 6: Crystallization of tagatose<br>
Crystallization of tagatose was performed by using the recovered solution from the  chromatography separation in example 5. The fraction including 90% of the final tagatose content was recovered. The fraction was concentrated in a crystallizer with vacuum and heating condition to make the sugar content 70 Bx. Then, the   temperature was lowered to 50 D, slowly by 2 degrees per hour. Tagatose seed was added at the temperature of 40D to grow crystals.<br>
As crystallization of tagatose progressed, the sugar concentration in the supernatant<br>
was comparatively diluted. To maintain the concentration of the diluted supernatant,<br>
vacuum concentration was continuously performed during the crystallization. That<br>
is, the concentration of the reaction supernatant was maintained at least 65 Bx during<br>
the crystallization and growing crystals.	,<br>
The crystallization was stopped 20 hours later.    Centrifugation was performed to<br>
 <br>
separate the supernatant and crystals. Tagatose recovery rate from the primary crystallization solution was 71%. The produced tagatose had at least 90 - 98% purity. Tagatose separated by centrifugation was dried in a vacuum drier at SOD for 1 hour. The generated tagatose crystal was observed under microscope, which is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. The shape and size of the generated tagatose crystal was compared with that of the commercial sucrose.<br>

1 pass test was performed with mixed sugar, and basic parameters were calculated from the result.    New Simulated Moving-bed System (Organo, Japan) was used and<br>
.„ simulation test with concentration profile of each component was performed using a computer. Then, purity of each component and recovery rate of each fraction were calculated.    Effluent liquid was separated from each fraction.    Each fraction was<br>
-analyzed by HPLC. From the result, elution curve of each component was made. Each elution pattern was examined and basic parameters of each component were calculated.    Conditions for 1 pass test are shown in Table 5.    Analysis method of<br>

Recovery rate of each sugar and purity thereof were measured from the analysis. The result of the simulation is summarized in Table 9. As shown in Table 9, cases #6, #7, #8, and #9 are mass balance sheets obtained from the result of the simulation. Tagatose demonstrated at least 90% purity as wanted in each simulation.

Example 9: Reaction stability of L-arabinose isomerase in mixed monosaccharide<br>
 In the economic tagatpse production process using three-phase chromatography proposed in this invention, the substrate solution is mostly composed of other sugars<br>
 <br>
than galactose, for example glucose, fructose, and sucrose, unlike the conventional isomerization from galactose to tagatose. So, it is an important condition for introduction of the technique of the present invention whether or not those different sugars could inhibit isomerization using enzymes. In this example, the present inventors tried to disclose substrate specificity of galactose isomerization in the mixed monosaccharide solution when the isomerase selected by the inventors was used. Each substrate solution was prepared by adding sucrose, glucose, and fructose to 100 g/L of galactose solution at a certain ratio. The composition ratio of each sugar was as follows: (a) Sue : Glu : Gal : Fru = 0 : 0 : 1 : 0, (b) Sue : Glu : Gal : Fru = 3 : 1 : 1 : 1, (c) Sue : Glu : Gai : Fru = 0:3:1:2. Each sugar ratio was regulated as similar to those of (a) the control group containing galactose only, (b) the group in which 1,4-linkage of galactose in oligosaccharide was selectively hydrolyzed, and (c) the group in which sugars were completely hydrolyzed to monosaccharides. For galactose isomerization, pellet of the deposited strain (CJ-1-TNAI, Accession No:<br>
_KCCM10786P) raised in the expression medium was added to the substrate solution at the concentration of 10% (w/v), followed by reaction at 70 D for 1 hour. Upon completion of the reaction, the mixed solution was cooled down at 4D for 15 minutes,<br>
 followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes to obtain supernatant.    The<br>
 <br>
obtained supernatant was 5-fold diluted with purified water, which passed through 0.45 p syringe filter (Millipore, USA), followed by HPLC analysis. Sugar concentration in the isomerized product in the mixed monosaccharide solution was analyzed by HPLC. The results are shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 16. The concentration of each sugar was quantified with each standard solution and the results are shown in Table 10.<br>
 <br>
As a result, it was confirmed that galactose isomerization in the mixed sugar solution comprising a large amount of sucrose,, glucose, and fructose was not affected and the reaction speed remained the same to give the consistent conversion rate (reached to the same conversion rate, 30.8%). Therefore, it was confirmed that glucose, fructose, and   sucrose   obtained   by   hydrolysis   of  raw   materials   originated   from   soy<br>
 <br>
oligosaccharide did not act as an obstacle for the galactose isomerization.<br>
Example 10: Designing of continuous recycling tagatose production process from hydrolysate of SOY bean whey using three-phase separation technique<br>
The tagatose production process designed in example 6 is characterized by two times     of chromatography which requires a huge amount of purified water and concentration.<br>

pretreatment by ultrafiltration or microfiltration;<br>
2.	hydrolyzing the soy oligosaccharide solution (concentration: 10-50%) at a high or a<br>

containing sucrose and galactose as major components (at least 90%) through L-<br>
arabinose isomerase (or L-galactose isomerase) reactor; ru4. separating the isomerized solution composed of the mixed sugar containing<br>
sucrose, galactose, and tagatose as major components (at least 90%) by three-phase<br>
chromatography;  Concentration step can be included or excluded according to the sugar content during<br>
the process.    The sugar separation solutions obtained from the chromatography<br>
above were the following three solutions:<br>
A.	Chromatography separation solution comprising tagatose as a major component (at<br>
least 90%), which can be proceed to concentration (if necessary) and crystallization.<br>

"Example 11: Designing of continuous recycling tagatose production process from hvdrolysate of soy bean whey using sucrose crystallization pretreatment<br>

single chromatography-explained above, the present inventors designed to reduce<br>
process utility by reducing sucrose content in the  sugar solution  via sucrose<br>
crystallization.<br>
Soy oligosaccharide contains excessive sucrose, which increases the volume of sugar<br>
solution for chromatography separation, increases equipment scale, and increases<br>
consumed purified water.<br>
So, the present inventors designed the tagatose production process using a single<br>
chromatography which included sucrose crystallization as a pretreatment step as<br>
follows.    This process is illustrated in Fig. 18 briefly.    The steps necessary for the<br>
 <br>
 improvement of the quality of a final product such as decolorization and desalinization are not separately included, because these steps can be included or excluded during the production process, considering the quality changes of the<br>
