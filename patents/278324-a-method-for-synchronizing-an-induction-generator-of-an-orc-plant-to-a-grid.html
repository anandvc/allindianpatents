				<td>A METHOD FOR SYNCHRONIZING AN INDUCTION GENERATOR OF AN ORC PLANT TO A GRED<br>
Cross-Reference To Related Applications<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority of U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/839,914 filed on May 6, 2004, and further identified by Attorney Docket No. 965-034.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to startup procedures for induction generators. More<br>
particularly, it relates to a synchronization procedure for an ORC motor-generator connected to a turbine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]	Traditionally, an induction generator can be started up as a motor using grid<br>
power to establish an excitation. With this method, the machine starts as a motor (i.e., consuming power), and it nins at slightly less than the grid synchronous speed. In an ORC machine, refrigerant vapor is subsequently directed to the turbine inlet, and is expanded by the turbine. As the flow of refrigerant increases, the induction machine changes its operating mode from a motor to a generator. As a generator, it runs at a speed slightly higher than the synchronous speed.<br>
[0004]	For large induction machines, starting as a motor requires the use of additional<br>
protection measures to avoid high inrush current. Low-voltage starters such as an autotransformer or a Wye-Delta starter are commonly used.<br>
[0005]	US Patent No. 5,714,862, issued to Mikesell et al. on February 3,1998,<br>
discloses a rotational speed measurement technique for a coasting induction motor. The<br>
speea îs measured by sensing the residual electrical voltages at the power terminals of the motor, thus eliminating the need for convenţional tachometer equipment, additional mechanical componenta, or modifications to the induction motor itself.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0006]	In one aspect, the invention relates to an ORC power generation plant. The<br>
ORC power generation plant comprises a motor-generator configured to be switchably connected directly to, and to be disconnected from, a power grid; a circulation path for a working fluid, comprising a turbine in mechanical communication with the motor-generator and having a fluid inlet and outlet; an evaporator having a thennal input for receiving thermal energy, an input for receiving the working fluid in liquid form, and an output in fluid communication with the fluid inlet of the turbine for providing the working fluid in vapor form to the fluid inlet of the turbine; a condenser having an input in communication with the outlet of the turbine for receiving the vapor from the fluid outlet, the condenser adapted to condense the vapor to the liquid and to deliver the liquid at a condenser outlet; and a variable speed pump for pumping the liquid, the variable speed pump having an input for receiving the liquid from the outlet of the condenser and an outlet for conveying the liquid to the input of the evaporator, the variable speed pump having a control signal input terminal. The ORC power generation plant additional includes a rotation speed sensor for measuring a rotation speed of the motor-generator, the rotation speed sensor providing an output signal; and a pump speed controller for controlling a speed of the pump, the pump speed controller receiving a signal based at least in part on the output signal of the rotation speed sensor and providing a control signal to the control signal input terminal of the variable speed pump. The ORC power plant îs configured to start with the motor-generator configured as a<br>
generator and disconnected from the power grid as a generator.<br>
[0007]	In one embodiment, the rotation speed sensor is a selected one of a magnetic<br>
piek-up and a tachometer. In one embodiment, the rotation speed sensor is an analytic sensor<br>
configured to estimate the rotation speed. In one embodiment, the analytic sensor is a sensor<br>
configured to measure a residual magnetic field in a winding. In one embodiment, the<br>
analytic sensor is a sensor configured to measure a vibration spectrum.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect, the invention features a method of controllably starting an<br>
ORC power generation plant. The method comprises the steps of starting the ORC power<br>
generation plant during a time when a motor-generator of the ORC power generation plant is<br>
disconnected from a power grid, the ORC power generation plant comprising a circulation<br>
path for a working fluid, the circulation path comprising a variable speed pump and a turbine<br>
in mechanical communication with the motor-generator; controlling an operation of the<br>
variable speed pump to drive the turbine, and thereby, the motor-generator; measuring a<br>
rotational speed of the motor-generator; and upon attaining a rotational speed of the motor-<br>
generator approximately equal to a steady state speed of the motor-generator when powered<br>
by the power grid directiv, switchably connecting the motor-generator to the power grid<br>
directly, thereby attaining steady state operation of the ORC power generation plant.<br>
[0009]	In one embodiment, the step of measuring a rotational speed of the motor-<br>
generator comprises searching for a peak of a vibration spectrum from which a rotational speed is extracted. In one embodiment, the step of measuring a rotational speed of the motor-generator comprises measuring residual magnetism in a rotor winding of the motor-generator. In one embodiment, before the ORC generator is connected to the grid, the rotational speed is controlled using the variable speed pump. In one embodiment, an increase in the pump speed increases the rotational speed. In one embodiment, a decrease in the pump speed<br>
 <br>
decreases the rotational speed.<br>
[0010]	The foregoing and other objects, aspects, features, and advantages of the<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following description and from the claims.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0016]	The Organic Rankine Bottoming Cycle (ORC) may be added to a distributed<br>
generation system to increase its overall efficiency. The ORC does not consume fuel directly, but uses the waste of the "prime-mover," which may be a micro-turbine or<br>
reciprocating device or other heat source. Fig. l shows a schematic of an illustrative ORC<br>
power plant embodying principles of the invention. The primary components are the<br>
condenser 110, a working fluid or refrigerent pump 120, an evaporator 130, an opţional<br>
recuperator (not shown in Fig. 1) and a turbine!40 connected to a motor-generator 150. The<br>
motor-generator 150 has contacts 160 which are used to connect the various motor-generator<br>
windings to a grid 170. In the embodiment shown in Fig. l, the grid 170 and the motor-<br>
generator 150 are indicated as being three-phase electrical systems. In the embodiment<br>
discussed herein, the working fluid is 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (known as R245fa),<br>
which is available from the Honeywell Corporation or E. I. DuPont DeNemours and<br>
Company.<br>
[0017]	The above-identified copending US Patent Application discusses various<br>
control methods for achieving the above goals during "steady state" operation. A separate<br>
<br>
control procedure for start up of the thermal dynamic cycle has been disclosed in the above-identified copending US Patent Application. The present disclosure discusses a startup procedure for the turbine generator unit of an ORC plant.<br>
[0018]	A startup method has been devised that allows the smooth connection of an<br>
induction generator to a grid without using additional equipment such as an autotransformer or a Wye-Delta starter. Thus a turbine/generator may be started with a simple inexpensive across-the-line contact starter. To accomplish this, the ORC plant is started with the contacts between the grid and generator open. The thermodynamic cycle is then activated by applymg heat to the evaporator and controlling the liquid refrigerent pump. The pressure ratio, the rurbine exit pressure divided by the inlet pressure, across the turbine begins at zero, but then increases. The pressure is controlled so that in this "freewheeling" state, the turbine 140, and with it the driven motor-generator 150, slowly increases toward synchronous speed. When<br>
the speed is near to the synchronous speed for the motor-generator, the across-the-line<br>
contactor 160 is closed.<br>
[0019]	There are two important new elements to accomplishing this startup rhethod:<br>
1.	A method by which the freewheeling speed of the turbine and motor-<br>
generator may be controlled as described hereinafter; and<br>
2.	An accurate (~1 %) measurement of the rotational speed of at least one of the<br>
motor-generator and the turbine when the motor-generator is near<br>
synchronous speed, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0020]	In the disclosure of the above-identified co-pending application, a smooth<br>
startup procedure for the thermal cycle of the ORC plant is described. During this startup<br>
period, the pressure upper limit of the superheat control system is varied dynamically to<br>
move the system operation from one region to another. The startup method transitions from<br>
open loop to closed loop, and then varies the pressure limits to slowly increase the operation<br>
pressure according to the following procedure:<br>
[0021]	The method includes the steps of:<br>
applying hoţ air to the evaporator, for example at approximately half the design enthalpy flux;<br>
turning on the pump at a reduced or minimum speed, for example 15 Hz;<br>
setting a high pressure limit to a value of pressure that can be achieved at steady-state at the iniţial low pump speed, for example 70 psia;<br>
waiting until the operating conditions come to the pressure plăteau of the pump curve;<br>
ramping up the pressure limit to its normal value, such as 280 psia;<br>
permitting the mode to switch from pressure control to superheat control at a pressure at or below the desired pressure limit, such as 280 psia; and<br>
increasing and controlling the hoţ air enthalpy flux to bring the system to full load,<br>
defined as maximum pressure and temperature at the evaporator exit.<br>
[0022]	Once the startup process enters the ramping up step, the speed of the turbine<br>
generator unit is continuously being monitored. As soon as the speed reaches a value near the synchronous speed (for example, within 5% of the synchronous speed), the contacts are closed, completing the synchronizing process of the generator. To utilize an induction rnachine as a generator, it is helpful to ensure that when the machine is connected to the grid, the speed of the rotor should be below the speed corresponding to the pushover point of the torque-speed characteristics as shown in Fig. 2. Once the system passes over the pushover point, the rotor speed will be out of control, endangering the integrity of the generator. If such an event occurs, the entire ORC system bas to be immediately shut down. [0023]         ' Fig. 2 is a diagram 200 that illustrates the relarions between power 210 and torque 220 as a function of rotational speed for a motor useful in performing the methods of the invention. As is seen, a range of rotational speed 230 is indicated, wherein it is safe to connect the motor to the grid by closing the electrical contacts to the motor. The pushover point 240 is indicated by a vertical line, which in the embodiment shown corresponds to a rotational speed of approximately 3840 RPM. The pushover point is defined as the rotational speed beyond which the generating torque decreases with increasing speed, which would lead to a runaway condition if unchecked.<br>
Speed Sensors<br>
[0024]	One way to measure the speed of the turbine is to use any commercially<br>
available rotation speed sensor, such as a tachometer or a magnetic pick-up sensor. A magnetic pick-up sensor is essentially a coil wound around a permanently magnetized probe.<br>
When discrete ferromagnetic objects such as gear teeth, turbine impeller blades, slorted discs, or shafts with keyways are passed through the probe's magnetic field, the flux density is modulated. This induces AC voltages in the coil. One complete cycle of voltage is generated for each object (or slot) that passes by the coil. If the objects (or slots) are evenly spaced on a rotating shaft, the total number of cycles will be a measure of the total rotation, and the frequency of the AC voltage will be directly proporţional to the rotational speed of the shaft. It is well known to measure AC frequency, for example with a counter.<br>
Analytical Sensors<br>
[0025]	Speed measurement using physical sensors requires the installation of the<br>
sensors onto the shaft of the generator. Analytical sensors have the advantage of avoiding any physical contact with the generator, and can be implemented using relatively inexpensive circuitry and, as needed, electromechanical componente. Analytical sensors are therefore generally less expensive options than convention sensors such as tachometers. The rotational speed of the rotor can be estimated analytically in two ways. The first way is to use the residual magnetism in the rotor winding to sense the speed of the rotor. In the freewheeling state, the stator winding circuit is open. Due to the residual magnetism in the rotor winding, a small AC voltage will be induced in the stator winding. This open circuit voltage across the stator winding terminala can be used to estimate the speed of the rotor. A frequency counter can be used to count the zero crossing points of the measured voltage waveform, thus giving the estimation of the rotor speed.<br>
[0026]	The second analytical technique is to use an accelerometer to measure the<br>
vibration of the turbine. The vibration sensor can be installed on the casing of the turbine. The vibration data are continuously captured and the spectrum of the vibration is calculated<br>
using the fast Fourier Transform, in a computaţional device that can be any of a programmed general purpose computer or general purpose microprocessor that uses a program comprising one or more instructions recorded on a machine-readable medium, or other devices that can perfbrm computations, such as a programmed gate array such as a FPGA, or a DSP. Frorn the spectrum, the rotation speed of the rotor can be estimated. Fig. 3 is a diagram 300 that shows a spectrum 310 of the vibration data measured on the casing of an ORC turbine-generator. There are a number of peaks in the spectrum, which corresponds to mainly the rotor rotational frequency and its harmonics. The first peak 301 in Fig. 3 corresponds to the rotor rotational frequency (fo), from which the rotational speed is calculated according to:<br>
where n is the rotational speed of the generator, anăfo is the rotor rotational frequency<br>
extracted from the spectrum, and P is the number poles of the rotor.<br>
[0027]	The ORC controller, implemented with a peak-searching algorithm,<br>
automatically extracts the first peak from the spectrum and uses it for the speed calculation. The commonly used peak searching algorithms known in the art can be used for rotor rotational speed extraction from the spectrum.<br>
[0028]	Fig. 4 is a diagram 400 that shows test data indicating the relationship between<br>
pump speed and the corresponding evaporator exit pressure (PEVAPEX) 410 and turbine speed (TURSPEED) 420 of an embodiment of the invention in an ORC plant. The lower curve is PEVAPEX 410. In the startup process the PEVAPEX 410 is slowly ramping up through the vanation in the pump speed. During this period the turbine 140 is driven by the vapor from the evaporator, and the motor-generator 150 is freewheeling. The motor-generator contacts 160 for connection to the grid are open. With the help of speed feedback,<br>
the contacte are closed when the speed of the turbine 140 and motor-generator 150<br>
approaches the synchronous speed of the motor-generator 150, which in the present<br>
embodiment is approximately 3600 rpm. Synchronizing the generator at this speed causes<br>
minimal inrush current, thus assuring a smooth connection into the grid.<br>
[0029]	Fig. 4 also illustrates the fact that the turbine speed can be adjusted through<br>
the actuator of the superheat control loop, the variable speed pump 120. If for some reason the turbine speed is not in a range that is considered to be safe to close the contacts 160, the turbine speed can be adjusted through varying the pump speed. Variations in pump speed actually change the mass flow rate of working fluid that is entering the turbine 140, thereby changing turbine speed.<br>
[0030]	The startup procedure disclosed hereinabove is advantageous in avoiding the<br>
use of additional startup equipment, such as is used in the convenţional startup procedure. The improved procedure and apparatus allows the simplification of the design of the synchronizing module of the ORC generator and reducing the costs through the avoidance of a throttle valve for turbine speed adjustment.<br>
[0031 ]	Those of ordinary skill will recognize that many funcţiona of electrical and<br>
electronic apparatus can be implemented in hardware (for example, hard-wired logic), in software (for example, logic encoded in a program operating on a general purpose processor), and in firmware (for example, logic encoded in a non-volatile memory that is invoked for operation on a processor as required), The present invention contemplates the substituţi on of one implementation of hardware, firmware and software for another implementaţi on of the equivalent functionality using a different one of hardware, firmware and software. To the extent that an implementation can be represented mathematically by a transfer function, that is, a specifîed response is generated at an output terminal for a specific excitation applied to<br>
an input terminal of a "black box" exhibiting the transfer function, any iraplementation of the<br>
transfer function, including any combination of hardware, firmware and software<br>
implementations of portions or segments of the transfer function, is contemplated herein.<br>
