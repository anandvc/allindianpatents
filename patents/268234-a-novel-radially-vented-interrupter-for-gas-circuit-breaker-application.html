				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to gas circuit breakers. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a radially vented interrupter for high voltage, high power gas<br>
circuit breaker.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A Circuit Breaker (CB) is primarily used to interrupt normal / fault / capacitive /<br>
inductive currents of high voltage installations. When the CB is in closed<br>
condition it allows conduction of electrical charge (current) through in a closed<br>
electrical system (circuit) depending on the system characteristics and<br>
conditions.<br>
When fault current is interrupted by a circuit breaker, arc is struck between the<br>
arcing contacts. The energy content of the arc depends on the current<br>
magnitude, length of the arc and similar other parameters. As the temperatures<br>
of the arc are quite high it decomposes the insulating medium and materials<br>
exposed to arc. Byproducts of the chemical reaction at elevated temperature also<br>
accumulate in the vicinity and shall be removed for sustaining the dielectric<br>
properties of the inter-electrode gap on interruption. In conventional gas circuit<br>
breakers, the arc products are vented through annular axial passages of fixed<br>
and moving parts of the interrupter. For large dimensions and operating strokes<br><br>
of the high voltage and high power interrupters the venting passages are long,<br>
hampering venting process. To achieve desired interrupter performance excess<br>
quantity of gas and higher differential pressures are used in conventional gas<br>
interrupters as on date.<br>
Three channels are mostly provided in conventional gas interrupters for venting<br>
the arc products:<br>
1. Throat of top arcing contact (fixed / movable)<br>
2. Throat of bottom / movable arcing contact and<br>
3. Time varying annular gap between top arcing contact (fixed / movable) and<br>
nozzle.<br>
The conductance of the flow channels, being proportional to its cross-section is<br>
limited by the length of the flow channel. The high impressed voltage demand<br>
higher dielectric clearances between the live connections of an interrupter. The<br>
length of the interrupter is divided in three section of two electrodes (fixed,<br>
moving) and the inter electrode gap. While inter electrode gap is minimal most<br>
of the interrupter length is divided in two electrode assemblies. The length of<br>
flow channel, at least for the moving contact assembly, is almost half of the<br>
interrupter length. For this constraint the arc product mostly is carried by top<br>
vent in mono flow interrupters while the situation is improved in dual flow<br>
interrupters. However, for this reason, none of the interrupters utilizes full<br>
capabilities of the flow channels.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a radially vented interrupter<br>
for high voltage, high power gas circuit breaker, which eliminates the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a radially vented interrupter for<br>
high voltage, high power gas circuit breaker, which exhibits improved current<br>
interruption capabilities.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a radially vented interrupter<br>
for high voltage, high power gas circuit breaker, which achieves an efficient total<br>
venting rate at interruption.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a radially vented interrupter for<br>
high voltage, high power gas circuit breaker, which achieves an improved mass<br>
flow rate around current zero.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a radially vented interrupter for<br>
high voltage, high power gas circuit breaker, which ensures clearance of arc<br>
products in time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a radially vented interrupter for high voltage high<br>
power gas circuit breaker, comprising; a compression volume which allows<br><br>
storage of cold gas for compression including collection of fresh gas during<br>
closing operation; an expansion volume which allows a direct exposure of the<br>
available gas during the arcing; an intermediate volume where stored gas is<br>
allowed to be compressed by the gas from the expansion volume thereby raising<br>
the gas pressure during the arcing period due to compression by the gas from<br>
the expansion volume including mixing of the gasses, the compression volume,<br>
the expansion volume, and the intermediate volume being strategically coupled<br>
to each other; a main chamber receiving beyond a particular point of time the<br>
gas flow from the expansion volume via multiple control outlets. A radial outlet<br>
for shortening the length of the exit channel of one of the multiple control outlets<br>
which optimizes the electrical circuit and the flow passages for the arcing<br>
products to achieve an improved total venting rate at interruption.<br>
Thus, the invention incorporates a radial exit close to inter-electrode gap, and<br>
optimizes the gas passage area between<br>
(a). intermediate and expansion volume<br>
(b). compression and intermediate volume<br>
for directing cold gas in either direction of inter-electrode gap as per required<br>
proportion.<br>
An optional Cushion volume for controlling the interrupting performance and<br>
damping characteristics is provided.<br><br>
One or multiple exits are arranged to control total conductance. An improved<br>
mass flow rate at interruption is provided to improve insulation recovery by<br>
regulating gas flow from the compression volume to inter-electrode gap by<br>
controlling various parameters such as:<br>
(a). Time instant at which the expansion volume pressure and<br>
intermediate volume pressures become equal.<br>
(b). Time instant at which the compression volume pressure exceeds<br>
intermediate volume pressure.<br>
(c). Difference of the compression and the intermediate volume<br>
pressures.<br>
The invented interrupter is of reduced size.<br>

invention.<br>
Figure 4: Shows a two-stage blast interrupter with radial exit according to the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in figure 4, the inventive, two-stage blast interrupter, comprises three<br>
strategically coupled volumes. The aim of this arrangement is to achieve efficient<br>
current interruption. The first volume is the compression volume (01), where a<br>
piston-cylinder arrangement allows storage of cold gas and its compression<br>
during interruption by movement of a piston (14) conventionally coupled to the<br>
operating mechanism/drive. The fresh gas is collected and retained in the<br>
compression volume (01) during closing operation. The second one is an<br>
expansion volume (02), where the available gas is directly exposed to the arc<br>
(13) during contact separation/ arcing. The third one is an intermediate volume<br>
(03), where stored gas is compressed by the expansion volume gas (02) and gas<br>
pressure rises during arcing period due to compression, by the expansion volume<br>
(02) gas, and mixing (refer Fig. 2). Inventers have earlier proposed a conditional<br>
gating device, a non-returnable flap valve [04], between the compression volume<br>
and intermediate volume vide the Indian patent application No. 1694/Kol/2007,<br>
which is incorporated herein by way of reference. The valve allows gas flow from<br>
the compression volume (01) to the intermediate volume (03) only when the<br>
pressure (Pc) of the compression volume (01) is greater than the pressure (Pj) of<br><br>
the intermediate volume (03). The gating device (a flap valve) is positioned<br>
between the intermediate (03) and compression volume (01).<br>
In the present two-stage blast interrupter, beyond a particular point of time, the<br>
movement of the nozzle (12) allow the gas to flow from the expansion volume<br>
(02) to a main chamber (05). During arcing period, in the interrupter the gas<br>
flows from the expansion (02) to the main chamber (05) through multiple<br>
controlled outlets. First one of the multiple controlled outlets is a throat fixed /<br>
movable contact (06). Second one is a throat of movable contact (07). The third<br>
one is an annular gap (08) between the fixed/movable contact (06) and the<br>
nozzle (12).<br>
According to the invention, a radial outlet (09) is introduced, shortening the<br>
length of the exit channel in the moving contact (07) of the interrupter. More<br>
clearly, the radial vent (09) opens in to the annular cavity of the moving arcing<br>
contact (07) (refer Fig. 3). This modification optimizes the electrical circuit and<br>
the flow passages for the arcing products. The aim of the arrangement is to<br>
achieve efficient total venting rate at interruption. For a particular fixed/movable<br>
contact passages, the improved flow conductance of the moving contact greatly<br>
improves the interrupter performance both in terms of short circuit capabilities<br>
and dielectric recovery. The inventive configuration allows the cold gas to be<br>
directed in either direction of inter-electrode gap in required proportion. In arcing<br>
phase, the pressure build-up in the expansion volume (02) is relatively high. The<br>
pressure difference generates proportionate mass flow which is improved for the<br><br>
presently proposed radially vented interrupter. Around the current zero, in the<br>
proposed interrupter, cold gas from the compression volume (01) can be<br>
transferred to sweep all ionized material in the arc column with improved window<br>
time. A Cushion volume [10] is arranged for controlling the pressure of the<br>
compression volume (01) and indirectly the interrupting capability of the device.<br>
This additional volume (10) avoids over pressure and slows down at end of<br>
stroke and over-damping. Thus, by using the invented two-stage blast<br>
interrupter with radial vent, significant improvement in mass flow rate around<br>
current zero can be achieved, which supports effective interruption of current.<br>
The mass flow rate at interruption in the proposed interrupter is further<br>
controlled by the following parameters in the invention:<br>
1. Time instant at which the pressure of the expansion volume (02) and that<br>
of the intermediate volume (03) become equal.<br>
2. Time instant at which the pressure of the compression volume (01)<br>
exceeds that of the intermediate volume (03).<br>
3. Difference of pressures of the compression and intermediate volume (01,<br>
03).<br>
The novelty of the proposed configuration is the availability of a vent close to the<br>
inter-electrode gap, ensuring clearance of arc products well in time. The<br><br>
shortening of the length of the exit channel helps in improving conductance and<br>
enhances discharge / discharge rate. The recovery of the medium in GCB is<br>
proportional to the pace at which the hot gas is evacuated from inter-electrode<br>
gap and fresh gas is replenished.<br><br>
