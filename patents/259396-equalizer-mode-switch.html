Reference is hereby also made to copending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/372,970, entitled ARCHITECTURE FOR A DECISION FEEDBACK EQUALIZER and filed in the names of the present inventors Heo, Markman, Park and Gelfand on April 16, 2002 and whereof the benefit of priority is hereby claimed and whereof the disclosure is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to adaptive equalizers, which may be used to compensate for signal transmission by way of a channel having unknown and/or time-varying characteristics such as may occur in high definition television reception and, more particularly, relates to an equalizer/forward error correction (FEC) automatic mode selector<br>
In the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard for High Definition Television (HDTV) in the United States, the equalizer is an adaptive filter which receives a data stream transmitted by vestigial sideband modulation (VSB), VSB<br>
being the modulation system in accordance with the ATSC-HDTV standard, at an average rate equal to the symbol rate of approximately 10.76 MHz.   The equalizer attempts to remove or reduce linear distortions mainly caused by multipath propagation, which are a typical characteristic of the terrestrial broadcast channel.   See United States Advanced Television Systems Committee, "ATSC Digital Television Standard," September 16, 1995<br>
Decision Feedback Equalizers (DFE's) as used in the communications art generally include a feedforward filter (FFF) and a feedback filter (FBF), wherein typically the FBF is driven by decisions on the output of the signal detector, and the filter coefficients can be adjusted to adapt to the desired characteristics to reduce the undesired distortion effects. Adaptation may typically take place by transmission of a "training sequence" during a synchronization interval in the signal or it may be by a "blind algorithm" using property restoral techniques of the transmitted signal    Typically, the equalizer has a certain number of taps in each of its filters, depending on such factors as the multipath delay spread to be equalized, and where the tap spacings "T" are generally, but not always, at the symbol rate.   An important parameter of such filters is the convergence rate, which may be defined as the number of iterations required for convergence to an optimum setting of the equalizer    For a more detailed analysis and discussion of such equalizers, algorithms used, and their application to communications work, reference is made to the technical literature and to text-books such as, for example, "Digital Communications", by John G. Proakis, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1989; "Wireless Communications" by Theodore S. Rappaport, Prentice Hall PTR, Saddle River, New Jersey, 1996; and "Principles of Data Transmission" by A P Clark, 2" edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1983.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An equalizer automatic mode switch in accordance with the present invention comprises a T-spaced (where T is the symbol period) DFE (Decision Feedback) equalizer with three available modes: training, blind and decision directed.<br>
Before entering into a detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be helpful to a better understanding of the principles of the present invention and to defining certain terms to consider first a somewhat simplified block diagram of a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) architecture as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The input to the DFE is coupled to a Feed-Forward Filter (FFF) 10 whose output is coupled to a summation unit 12, the other input to summation unit 12 being coupled to the output of a Feed-Back Filter (FBF) 14   The output of summation unit 12 is coupled to a sheer 16, to an input of a mode switch 18, and to a lock detector 20.   The output of lock detector 20 is coupled to a control input of mode switch 18. The output of sheer 16 is coupled to another input of mode switch 18 and an output of mode switch 18 is coupled to an input of FBF 14. Another output of mode switch 18 is coupled to coefficient control inputs of FFF 10 and FBF 14.<br>
The functions of the FFF 10, FBF 14 and sheer 16 are well known and constitute the basic functions of filtering and quantization, respectively. See, for example, the afore-cited text by Proakis. Additional information on filters and their implementation can be found in various textbooks such as, for example, "Digital Signal Processing," by John G. Proakis and Dimitris G. Manolakis, Prentice Hall, New Jersey, 1996 and "Introduction to Digital Signal Processing," by Roman Kuc, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; 1988   Lock detector 20 is responsible for the equalizer convergence detection function. It updates the lock detector output by comparing the equalizer output against the sheer levels with a threshold. If the equalizer output and sheer levels are within the threshold distance, a lock or convergence is detected   Mode switch 18 selects the input to the FBF filter as well as the error and control signals to be<br>
used in the equalizer adaptation, according to the equalizer mode of choice. It also checks the lock detector output   In normal operation, mode switch 18 has an automatic switching capability, which depends on the output of equalizer lock detector 20   Mode switch 18 interprets the training and blind modes as being used for convergence purposes only. After the equalizer lock detector detects convergence, the equalizer is then transitioned to the decision directed mode. If convergence is lost, the equalizer goes back to training or blind mode.<br>
In the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard, a training sequence was included in the field sync to allow for initial equalizer convergence. In training mode, the equalizer coefficients are only updated during the field sync However, two main drawbacks associated with its use are that it requires prior correct detection of the field sync and that the training sequence is contained in the field sync, which only occurs approximately every 25 milliseconds (ms), possibly resulting in slow convergence.<br>
For ghost environments that make it difficult to detect a field sync or with a dynamic component, it is of interest to have an initial adjustment of the equalizer tap coefficients independent of a training sequence, that is, self-recovering or blind   See, for example the above cited text by Proakis and the paper by D N. Godard, "Self-Recovering Equalization and Carrier Tracking in Two Dimensional Data Communication Systems" IEEE Trans on Commun., Vol COM-28, pp 1867-1875, November 1980<br>
Furthermore, because it works on every data symbol, the blind algorithm will have a faster convergence.<br>
As is typically the case in the conventional dd mode, the input to FBF 14 is the output of slicer 16   Thus, in the dd mode, the adaptation error and the input to the feedback filter are aided by the presence of a sheer, and coefficient adaptation takes place throughout the data sequence.   This mode does not have good convergence capabilities, but after convergence, it has advantages over the other two modes   The advantage of dd mode with respect to blind mode is attributable to the presence of the<br>
sheer, resulting in better MSE (mean squared error) and BER (bit error rate) performance at the equalizer output   With respect to the training mode, the fact that dd updates its tap on every symbol, as opposed to training symbols only, allows for faster adaptation and tracking capabilities<br>
It is herein recognized that the use of blind and dd modes as an aid or as alternative approaches to the training mode are desirable because, inter alia, the training mode in the ATSC-HDTV standard has a slow convergence, as well as poor dynamic tracking capabilities<br>
In what follows, reference is made to an HDTV receiver and to some of its components and it may be helpful to briefly mention their context.   In such a receiver, the adaptive channel equalizer is typically followed by a phase tracking network for removing phase and gain noise from which the signal goes to a trellis decoder followed by a data de-interleaver    The signal is then Reed-Solomon error corrected and then descrambled after which it undergoes audio, video, and display processing    Further details may be found in the technical literature such as, for example, the handbook "Digital Television Fundamentals", by Michael Robin and Michel Pouhn, McGraw-Hill, New York; second edition, 2000<br>
Figure 2 shows a graph of BER (Bit Error Rate) vs SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) performance curves for the equalizer and Viterbi decoder of an HDTV receiver in the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel. The performance is measured after the equalizer as well as after the Viterbi decoder (VD). The Viterbi decoder follows the equalizer in the receiver design and decodes the first level of FEC (Forward Error Correction), corresponding to a TCM (Trellis Coded Modulation) code<br>
In Figure 2, three curves are shown for the equalizer (upper set of curves) as well as VD output (lower set of curves) one for the equalizer in blind mode only, the second for the equalizer in automatic switching mode and the third for the equalizer in soft automatic switching mode. In automatic switching mode, the equalizer is in blind mode prior to convergence, and switches to dd mode after convergence is detected. If<br>
convergence is lost, it switches back to blind mode. Soft automatic switching mode is similar to automatic switching mode, except that the dd mode is a soft dd mode   In soft dd mode, the input to the feedback filter is the output of the equalizer, instead of the sheer output.<br>
In view of the characteristics shown in Figure 2, the following are herein recognized.<br>
a.   The equalizer output performance under automatic mode is equal to or better than under blind mode. For increasing SNR, the automatic switching performance is increasingly better,<br>
b    The VD output performance reflects the equalizer output performance.   Under automatic switching mode, it is equal or better than under blind mode. For increasing SNR, the automatic switching performance is increasingly better.<br>
c.   The automatic switching and soft automatic switching modes present similar performance both at the equalizer output and VD output<br>
It is helpful to a better understanding of the relationship between blind and dd mode in automatic switching mode to consider Figure 3, which shows curves of the equalizer lock detector in the AWGN channel for different SNR values.   The SNR is 13dB in the top graph of Figure 3, 15dB in the center, and 18dB in the bottom graph. In Figure 3, a 0 level on the ordinate scale indicates that the equalizer is not locked, that is, it is in blind mode. When the equalizer is locked, the lock detector output assumes the value of 1, that is, the equalizer is in dd mode. We observe that for low SNR, the equalizer is mainly in blind mode, that is, convergence is never detected due to the high level of noise   This is an imperfection of the lock detector that cannot practicably be overcome   For high SNR, the convergence is eventually detected, and the equalizer is transitioned to dd mode. At a medium SNR, there is constant switching of the lock detector, with noise affecting its ability to detect equalizer convergence besides<br>
potentially affecting the equalizer convergence.   Similar behavior can be expected for the equalizer in soft automatic switching mode.<br>
If a multipath signal is now introduced in the channel, some differences in the system simulation may be observed   Figure 4 shows BER vs. SNR performance curves for the HDTV receiver in the AWGN plus multipath channel. The multipath channel comprises one 3dB, 3fisec ghost, which is a relatively strong ghost.   As in Figure 2, the performance is measured after the equalizer as well as after the Viterbi decoder (VD). Also, three curves are shown for the equalizer as well as for the VD output one for the equalizer in blind mode only, another for the equalizer in automatic switching mode and the third one for the equalizer in soft automatic switching mode.<br>
In soft automatic switching mode, the equalizer is in blind mode prior to convergence, and switches to soft dd mode after convergence is detected. If convergence is lost, it switches back to blind mode. In soft dd mode, as opposed to the conventional dd mode, the input to the feedback filter is the output of the equalizer.<br>
In view of the characteristics shown m Figure 4, the following are herein recognized<br>
a.	Under automatic switching mode the equalizer output performance is equal to or<br>
better than in blind mode and in soft automatic switching mode. For increasing SNR,<br>
the automatic switching performance is increasingly better.<br>
b.	However, the VD output performance does not reflect the equalizer output<br>
performance, especially for medium SNR. For those values of SNR, the VD output<br>
performance is worse under automatic switching mode rather than in blind mode and<br>
soft automatic switching mode by up to about 1.5dB<br>
c.	While it is not apparent from Figure 4, additional simulations show that for higher<br>
SNR values, the VD performance under automatic switching mode will again be<br>
better or equal than under blind mode and soft automatic switching mode<br>
d    Additional simulations also show that the problem described in item b above becomes more evident for strong ghosts, although still present at a smaller scale for weaker<br>
ghosts.<br>
It is helpful to an understanding of the difference in performance behavior between the equalizer and Viterbi decoder when the equalizer is under blind or automatic switching mode, to compute the number of error bursts at the equalizer output under these two modes<br>
Figure 5 shows plots for the number of bursts of errors versus the length of the burst under both equalizer modes, and for different SNR measures. The SNR is 18dB in the top graph of Figure 5, 21dB in the center, and 25dB in the bottom graph In view of the characteristics shown in Figure 5, the following are herein recognized:<br>
a	Under low SNR conditions, the number of errors is very similar for both blind<br>
and automatic switching mode. Long error bursts are present in both modes, with a slightly greater number for blind mode,<br>
b.	Under medium SNR conditions, the number of error bursts and error burst length<br>
are clearly greater for automatic switching mode as compared with blind mode, as the number of long error bursts under blind mode decreases and automatic switching mode is not affected as much by the increase in SNR; and<br>
c	Under high SNR conditions the number of error bursts and error burst length<br>
become greater for blind mode as compared with automatic switching mode, as the number of long error bursts under automatic switching mode now decreases at a faster rate with increasing SNR<br>
Figure 6 shows the equalizer lock detector output against the number of iterations (x 104). The SNR is 18dB in the top graph of Figure 6, 21dB in the center, and 25dB in the bottom graph The notion of low, medium or high SNR is actually dependent on the ghost profile and strength, since different ghosts imply different performance However, as shown in Figure 6, there is a relation between the SNR and the equalizer lock detector performance. As was the case in the AWGN channel, it is observed that for low SNR, the equalizer is mainly in blind mode, that is, convergence is never detected due to the<br>
high level of noise. For high SNR, the convergence is eventually detected, and the equalizer is transitioned to dd mode, remaining stable in that mode.   At medium SNR, there is constant switching of the lock detector, as the level of noise does not allow for a stable dd mode   Similar behavior can be expected for the equalizer in soft automatic switching mode.<br>
Based on the foregoing considerations and information presented, it is a feature of the present invention to detect these conditions of error propagation for which the standard dd mode delivers a worse performance than the soft dd mode, and to switch the modes<br>
Ideally, the equalizer lock detector would detect convergence regardless of the SNR. However, it is impracticable to implement an algorithm that is sufficiently immune to poor SNR.   Furthermore, in a multipath environment, noise also affects the ability of the equalizer to converge and track and therefore, regardless of the ghost profile or SNR, it is desirable to detect unstable lock detector conditions<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show exemplary embodiments of an equalizer mode switch in accordance with the present invention   The invention proceeds to identify unstable conditions of the lock detector and uses this information in deciding upon the appropriate equalizer mode   The principle as applied in the present invention is that of threshold comparison   The remaining operations of the mode switch regarding the input to the FBF, error and control signal generation for the adaptation remain as explained in Section 1<br>
In Figure 7, the lock detector transitions are counted during a certain window period of W symbol time periods and the number of transitions, NTr, is compared against a threshold, Thr. The system is initialized after each window period W and starts counting again   The window period, W, and the threshold, Thr, are programmable variables whose values can be identified after proper system testing. The two flip-flops, FF1 and FF2, are D- flip-flops with enable.   The input eql_lock_int, which corresponds<br>
to the equalizer lock detector output, is delayed by FF1 and exclusive-or'ed, with its delayed version   This operation identifies transitions in the lock detector.<br>
Counter 1 has a clock enable input and outputs the number of transitions NTr counted within a window of W counts    Counter 2 is a wrap around symbol counter with a window of W counts, which outputs a maximum count indicator, max_ind   This signal max_ind is 'high' or T when Counter 2 has reached its limit of W symbol count, and otherwise, it is iow' or   '0'.   When max_ind = 1, FF2 will store the value NTr   This value is then compared against the threshold count, Thr.   If NTr &gt; Thr, there are too many lock detector transitions and the signal sel is set to '0'.   If NTr 
It will be understood that the circuit described in Figure 7 is used as an exemplary embodiment of this invention and that other similar circuits may provide the same functionality of detecting the lock detection instability.<br>
In Figure 7, the signal sel gives an indication of whether the system should be set in soft automatic switching mode (sel = 0) or should be kept in automatic switching mode (sel = 1), which is the standard equalizer mode switch. In automatic switching mode, the equalizer is set to blind mode at startup; it switches to dd mode after equalizer convergence is detected and switches back to blind mode if convergence is lost   The indicator of equalizer convergence is the signal eql_lock_int, the equalizer lock detector output    In soft automatic switching mode, the dd mode is replaced by a soft dd mode, otherwise being similar to the automatic switching mode.<br>
Figure 8 contains a state machine representation for an embodiment of the present invention that utilizes the signal sel as an input, and introduces a further level of hysteresis   It counts within a window of size N periods of W symbols, the number of periods when sel remained at 0 or 1, depending on the current state being the normal lock or the altered lock state, respectively. At reset, the state machine is at normal lock state, and the equalizer mode switch is 1, that is, the automatic switching mode is chosen   The state machine continuously checks on the signal set and counts occurrences of sel = 1<br>
with variable sel_count   If sel_count is less than the established threshold sel_thr, then the state machine transitions to the altered lock state. Once in the altered lock state, the equalizer mode switch is set to 0, meaning soft automatic switching mode. Similarly, the state machine continuously checks on the signal sel, and counts occurrences of sel = I with variable sel_count   If sel_count is greater than or equal to the established threshold, sel_thr, then the state machine transitions to the normal lock state.<br>
It will be understood that the diagram described in Figure 8 is used as an exemplary embodiment of this invention and that other similar state machines may provide the same functionality of added hysteresis to the signal sel.<br>
While the invention has been described and explained by way of an equalizer mode switch designed for the HDTV-ATSC equalizer, its principles can be applied to any general equalizer with a DFE architecture, in a system where the equalizer is followed by a trellis or convolutional decoder   For such a system, the error propagation into the DFE filter originated by linear distortion, noise and the sheer presence in dd mode results in bursty type of noise at the equalizer output, which will tend to impair the decoder performance   It will be understood that the various functions of the invention may be carried out by software in a programmed computer application or may be implemented in the form of hard circuits, integrated or otherwise or by a combination of both. In addition, although described in the context of a symbol-spaced (T-spaced, where T is the symbol period) equalizer, the invention can also be applied to fractionally spaced equalizers. Fractionally spaced equalizers are described in several textbooks, such as the afore-mentioned "Digital Communications", by John G. Proakis, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1989. Also, the soft decision directed input to the FBF, although described as the equalizer output, could be a more complex soft decision function of the equalizer output It should be also understood that the equalizer in Figure 1 could include the training mode as well. The training mode of operation would be exclusive with respect to the blind mode as in a traditional DFE and would not interfere with the decision directed modes<br>
