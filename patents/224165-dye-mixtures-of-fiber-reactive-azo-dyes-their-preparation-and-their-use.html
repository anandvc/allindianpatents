				<td>DYE MIXTURES OF FIBER-REACTIVE AZO DYES, THEIR PREPARATION AND<br>
THEIR USE<br>
The invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.<br>
Fiber-reactive azo dye mixtures and their use for dyeing hydroxyl- and/or<br>
carboxamido-containing material in orange to red hues are known for example<br>
from the documents EP 0 681 007, EP 1 013 729, EP 0 957 137 and<br>
EP 0 719 841. However, these have certain performance defects, for example an<br>
excessive dependence of the color yield on changing dyeing parameters in the<br>
dyeing operation, or an insufficient or unlevel color buildup on cotton (good color<br>
buildup follows from the ability of a dye to produce the correspondingly stronger<br>
dyeing from an increased concentration of dye in the dyebath). Possible<br>
consequences of these defects are for example poor reproducibilities for the<br>
dyeings which are obtainable, which ultimately compromises the economics of the<br>
dyeing operation.<br>
Consequently, there continues to be a demand for novel reactive dyes or reactive<br>
dye mixtures having improved properties, such as high substantivity combined<br>
with good washoff for unfixed portions. They shall moreover also provide good<br>
dyeing yields and possess high reactivity and they shall more particularly provide<br>
dyeings having high degrees of fixation.<br>
The present invention, then, provides dye mixtures which possess these above-<br>
described properties to a high degree. The novel dye mixtures are notable in<br>
particular for high yields of fixation and ready washoff for portions not fixed on the<br>
fiber. In addition, the dyeings exhibit good general fastnesses, such as for example<br>
high lightfastness and very good wetfastnesses, and also have a low tendency to<br>
stain polyamide in the case of cotton-polyamide blend fabrics.<br>
The invention accordingly provides dye mixtures which comprise one or more, such<br>
as two or three, preferably 1 or 2, dyes of the hereinbelow indicated and defined<br>
general formula (I)<br>
and one or more, such as two or three, preferably 1 or 2, dyes of the hereinbelow<br>
indicated and defined general formula (II)<br>

The dye mixtures according to the invention can be present as a preparation in solid<br>
or liquid (dissolved) form. In solid form, they contain, to the extent necessary, the<br>
electrolyte salts customary in the case of water-soluble and especially fiber-reactive<br>
dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may<br>
further contain the auxiliaries customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer<br>
substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7, for<br>
example sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium<br>
dihydrogenphosphate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, also dyeing auxiliaries,<br>
dustproofing agents and small amounts of siccatives; when they are present in a<br>
liquid, aqueous solution (including a content of thickeners of the type customary in<br>
print pastes), they may also contain substances which ensure a long life for these<br>
preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
In solid form, the dye mixtures according to the invention are generally present as<br>
powders or granules which contain electrolyte salt and which will hereinbelow<br>
generally be referred to as a preparation with or without one or more of the<br>
abovementioned auxiliaries. In the preparations, the dye mixture is present at 20 to<br>
90% by weight, based on the preparation containing it. The buffer substances are<br>
generally present in a total amount of up to 5% by weight, based on the preparation.<br>
When the dye mixtures according to the invention are present in an aqueous<br>
solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions is up to about 50% by<br>
weight, for example between 5 and 50% by weight, the electrolyte salt content of<br>
these aqueous solutions preferably being below 10% by weight, based on the<br>
aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) can contain the<br>
aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to 5% by<br>
weight and preferably up to 2% by weight.<br>
Dyes of the general formula (I) are described in DE 196 00 765 A1 and dyes of the<br>
general formula (II) are described in DE 2748965 and also extensively in the<br>
literature and are obtainable via standard synthesis methods.<br>
Dyes of the general formulae (15) and (16) are in some instances formed during the<br>
synthesis of dyes of the general formulae (I).<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are preparable in a conventional<br>
manner, as by mechanically mixing the individual dyes, whether in the form of their<br>
dye powders or granules or their as-synthesized solutions or in the form of aqueous<br>
solutions of the individual dyes generally, which may additionally contain customary<br>
auxiliaries, or by conventional diazotization and coupling of suitable mixtures of diazo<br>
and coupling components in the desired amount ratios.<br>
For example, when the diazo components having the groups D2 and D3 and, if<br>
appropriate, D4 and optionally D7 as per the general formulae (I) and (II) and, if<br>
appropriate, (100) and (Gb) have the same meaning, it is possible for an amine of the<br>
general formula (17)<br>
D2-NH2 (17),<br>
where D2 is as defined above, to be diazotized in a conventional manner and the<br>
diazonium compound obtained being subsequently reacted with an aqueous solution<br>
or suspension of a mixture having a fixed ratio of a monoazo dye as per the general<br>
formula (15) and of at least one coupler as per the general formula (18) and<br>
optionally of a monoazo dye as per the general formula (19)<br>
where D1, D6, R*, R**, RÂ°, R32, T, b, f, v and M are each as defined above.<br>
Alternatively, the dye mixture according to the present invention can be prepared<br>
when the groups D1, D2 and D3 and, if appropriate, D4 and optionally D6, D7 as per<br>
the general formulae (I) and (II) and, if appropriate, (100) and (Gb) have the same<br>
meaning, which comprises an amine of the general formula (20)<br>
D1-NH2 (20),<br>
where D1 is as defined above, being diazotized in a conventional manner and<br>
coupled onto a mixture of in each case at least one coupling component (21) and<br>
(15) and also optionally (22)<br>
where R*, R**, RÂ°, R32, T, b, f, v and M are each as defined above, firstly at a pH<br>
below 3 in a first stage and subsequently further coupled by an increase in pH to<br>
form a mixture of the dyes of the general formulae (I) and (II) and optionally (Gb).<br>
The dye mixture according to the present invention is isolated in a conventional<br>
manner by salting out for example with sodium chloride or potassium chloride or by<br>
spray drying or evaporation.<br>
Similarly, the solutions produced in the course of the synthesis of the dyes of the<br>
general formula (I) and (II) and optionally (Ga) to (Gf) can be used directly as liquid<br>
products in dyeing, if appropriate after addition of a buffer substance and if<br>
appropriate after concentrating.<br>
Dye mixtures which as well as b-chloroethylsulfonyl or (i-thiosulfatoethylsulfonyl or<br>
b-sulfatoethylsulfonyl groups also contain vinylsulfonyl groups as reactive radicals<br>
can be synthesized not only starting from appropriately substituted vinylsulfonyl-<br>
anilines or naphthylamines but also by reaction of a dye mixture where Z is<br>
Ã-chloroethyl, Ã-thiosulfatoethyl or Ã-sulfatoethyl with an amount of alkali required for<br>
the desired fraction and converting the Ã-substituted ethylsulfonyl groups mentioned<br>
into vinylsulfonyl groups. This conversion is effected in a manner familiar to one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention have useful application properties. They<br>
are used for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for<br>
example in the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for<br>
example composed of polyamide, or in bulk, such as for example polyamide and<br>
pOlyurethane, but especially for dyeing and printing these materials in fiber form.<br>
Similarly, the as-synthesized solutions of the dye mixtures according to the invention<br>
can be used directly as a liquid preparation for dyeing, if appropriate after addition of<br>
a buffer substance and if appropriate after concentration or dilution.<br>
The present invention thus also provides for the use of the dye mixtures according to<br>
the invention for dyeing or printing these materials, or rather processes for dyeing or<br>
printing these materials in a conventional manner, by using a dye mixture according<br>
to the invention or its individual components (dyes) individually together as a<br>
colorant. The materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials,<br>
especially in the form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form<br>
of hanks or wound packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example<br>
cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such<br>
as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example<br>
staple viscose and filament viscose and also chemically modified cellulose fibers,<br>
such as aminated cellulose fibers or fibers as described for example in WO 96/37641<br>
and WO 96/37642 and also in EP-A-0 538 785 and EP-A-0 692 559.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides<br>
and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other<br>
animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nyIon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be applied to and fixed on the<br>
substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application<br>
techniques known for water-soluble dyes and especially for fiber-reactive dyes. For<br>
instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long liquor<br>
and also from a short liquor, for example in a liquor to goods ratio of 5 : 1 to 100 :1,<br>
preferably 6 : 1 to 30 :1, using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral<br>
salts as far as necessary, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having<br>
very good color yields. Application is preferably from an aqueous bath at<br>
temperatures between 40 and 105Â°C, optionally at a temperature of up to 130Â°C<br>
under superatmospheric pressure, but preferably at 30 to 95Â°C, especially 45 to<br>
65Â°C, in the presence or absence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. One possible<br>
procedure here is to introduce the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat<br>
the bath to the desired dyeing temperature and complete the dyeing process at that<br>
temperature. The neutral salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also<br>
if desired only be added to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been<br>
reached.<br>
Padding processes likewise provide excellent color yields and a very good color<br>
buildup on cellulose fibers, the dyes being fixable in a conventional manner by<br>
batching at room temperature or elevated temperature, for example at up to 60Â°C, or<br>
in a continuous manner, for example by means of a pad-dry-pad steam process, by<br>
steaming or using dry heat.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried<br>
out in one step, for example by printing with a print paste containing sodium<br>
bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to<br>
103Â°C, or in two steps, for example by printing with a neutral to weak acidic print<br>
color and then fixing either by passing the printed material through a hot electrolyte-<br>
containing alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-containing<br>
padding liquor and subsequent batching or steaming or dry heat treatment of the<br>
alkali-overpadded material, produce strong color prints with well-defined contours<br>
and a clear white ground. The outcome of the prints is affected little, if at all, by<br>
variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix<br>
processes, hot air at 120 to 200Â°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at 101<br>
to 103Â°C, it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at<br>
temperatures of up to 160Â°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the dye mixtures<br>
according to the invention on the cellulose fibers are for example water-soluble basic<br>
salts of alkali metals and likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids<br>
or compounds which liberate alkali in the heat, and also alkali metal silicates.<br>
Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to<br>
medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the<br>
sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents are for example<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium<br>
hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate, trisodium phosphate or waterglass or<br>
mixtures thereof, for example mixtures of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and<br>
waterglass.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of the dye mixtures of the present<br>
invention in printing inks for digital textile printing by the inkjet process.<br>
The printing inks of the present invention comprise the reactive dye mixtures of the<br>
present invention, for example in amounts from 0.1 % by weight to 50% by weight,<br>
preferably in amounts from 1 % by weight to 30% by weight and more preferably in<br>

They may also include combinations of the aforementioned reactive dye mixtures<br>
with other reactive dyes used in textile printing. For the inks to be used in the<br>
continuous flow process, a conductivity of 0.5 to 25 mS/m can be set by adding an<br>
electrolyte.<br>
Useful electrolytes include for example lithium nitrate and potassium nitrate.<br>

The printing inks of the invention may further include customary additives, for<br>
example viscosity moderators to set viscosities in the range from 1.5 to 40.0 mPas in<br>
a temperature range from 20 to 50Â°C. Preferred inks have a viscosity of 1.5 to<br>
20 mPas and particularly preferred inks have a viscosity of 1.5 to 15 mPas.<br>

associative thickeners, polyurea, polyurethane, sodium alginates, modified<br>
galactomannans, polyetherurea, polyurethane, nonionic cellulose ethers.<br>
As further additives the inks of the invention may include surface-active substances<br>
to set surface tensions of 20 to 65 mN/m, which are adapted if necessary as a<br>
function of the process used (thermal or piezotechnology).<br>
Useful surface-active substances include for example: all surfactants, preferably<br>
nonionic surfactants, butyldiglycol, 1,2-hexanediol.<br>
The inks may further include customary additives, for example substances to inhibit<br>
fungal and bacterial growth in amounts from 0.01 to 1 % by weight based on the total<br>
weight of the ink.<br>
The inks may be prepared in a conventional manner by mixing the components in<br>
water.<br>
The dye inks of the invention are useful in inkjet printing processes for printing a wide<br>
variety of pretreated materials, such as silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibers and<br>
polyurethanes, and especially cellulosic fiber materials of any kind. Such fiber<br>
materials are for example the natural cellulose fibers, such as cotton, linen and<br>
hemp, and also pulp and regenerated cellulose. The printing inks of the invention are<br>
also useful for printing pretreated hydroxyl- or amino-containing fibers present in<br>
blend fabrics, for example blends of cotton, silk, wool with polyester fibers or<br>
polyamide fibers.<br>
In contrast to conventional textile printing, where the printing ink already contains all<br>
the fixing chemicals and thickeners for a reactive dye, in inkjet printing the auxiliaries<br>
have to be applied to the textile substrate in a separate pretreatment step.<br>
The pretreatment of the textile substrate, for example cellulose and regenerated<br>
cellulose fibers and also silk and wool, is effected with an aqueous alkaline liquor<br>
prior to printing. To fix reactive dyes there is a need for alkali, for example sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium acetate, trisodium phosphate, sodium<br>
silicate, sodium hydroxide, alkali donors such as, for example, sodium chloroacetate,<br>
sodium formate, hydrotropic substances such as, for example, urea, reduction<br>
inhibitors, for example sodium nitrobenzenesulfonates, and also thickeners to<br>
prevent flowing of the motives when the printing ink is applied, for example sodium<br>
alginates, modified polyacrylates or highly etherified galactomannans.<br>
These pretreatment reagents are uniformly applied to the textile substrate in a<br>
defined amount using suitable applicators, for example using a 2- or 3-roll pad,<br>
contactless spraying technologies, by means of foam application or using<br>
appropriately adapted inkjet technologies, and subsequently dried.<br>
After printing, the textile fiber material is dried at 120 to 150Â°C and subsequently<br>
fixed.<br>
The fixing of the inkjet prints prepared with reactive dyes may be effected at room<br>
temperature or with saturated steam, with superheated steam, with hot air, with<br>
microwaves, with infrared radiation, with laser or electron beams or with other<br>
suitable energy transfer techniques.<br>
A distinction is made between one- and two-phase fixing processes:<br>
In one-phase fixing, the necessary fixing chemicals are already on the textile<br>
substrate.<br>
In two-phase fixing, this pretreatment is unnecessary. Fixing only requires alkali,<br>
which, following inkjet printing, is applied prior to the fixing process, without<br>
intermediate drying. There is no need for further additives such as urea or thickener.<br>
Fixing is followed by the print aftertreatment, which is the prerequisite for good<br>
fastnesses, high brilliance and an impeccable white ground.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are notable for outstanding color<br>
strength when applied to the cellulose fiber materials by dyeing or printing in the<br>
presence of no or very small amounts of alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds. In<br>
these special cases, for instance, no electrolyte salt is required for a shallow depth of<br>
shade, not more than 5 g/l of electrolyte salt is required for a medium depth of shade<br>
and not more than 10 g/l of electrolyte salt is required for deep shades.<br>
According to the invention, a shallow depth of shade refers to the use of 2% by<br>
weight of dye based on the substrate to be dyed, a medium depth of shade refers to<br>
the use of 2 to 4% by weight of dye based on the substrate to be dyed and a deep<br>
shade refers to the use of 4 to 10% by weight of dye based on the substrate to be<br>
dyed.<br>
The dyeing and prints obtainable with the dye mixtures according to the invention<br>
possess bright shades; more particularly, the dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber<br>
materials possess good lightfastness and especially good wetfastnesses, such as<br>
fastness to washing, milling, water, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and alkaline<br>
perspiration, also good fastness to pleating, hotpressing and rubbing. Furthermore,<br>
the cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment of rinsing to<br>
remove unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent wetfastnesses, in particular since<br>
unfixed dye portions are easily washed off because of their good solubility in cold<br>
water.<br>
Furthermore, the dye mixtures according to the invention can also be used for the<br>
fiber-reactive dyeing of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or<br>
low-felting finish (cf. for example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-<br>
Verlag, 3rd edition (1972), pages 295-299, especially finished by the Hercosett<br>
process (page 298); J. Soc. Dyers and Colorists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44), can<br>
be dyed to very good fastness properties. The process of dyeing on wool is here<br>
carried out in a conventional manner from an acidic medium. For instance, acetic<br>
acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium<br>
acetate can be added to the dyebath to obtain the desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of<br>
acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary leveling agent, for example a<br>
leveling agent based on a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with three times the<br>
molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an<br>
aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example<br>
stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dye mixture according to the<br>
invention is preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic<br>
dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward<br>
the end of the dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline<br>
range up to a pH of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full<br>
reactive bond between the dyes of the dye mixtures according to the invention and<br>
the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber<br>
materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a<br>
temperature of about 40QC, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then<br>
adjusted to the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the<br>
actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98Â°C. However, the<br>
dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at<br>
temperatures of up to 106Â°C. Since the water solubility of the dye mixtures according<br>
to the invention is very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary<br>
continuous dyeing processes. The color strength of the dye mixtures according to the<br>
invention is very high.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention dye the materials mentioned, preferably<br>
fiber materials, in orange to red shades having very good fastness properties.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages<br>
are by weight, unless otherwise stated. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume as<br>
the kilogram relative to the liter. The compounds described in the examples in terms<br>
of a formula are indicated in the form of the sodium salts, since they are generally<br>
prepared and isolated in the form of their salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts,<br>
and used for dyeing in the form of their salts. The starting compounds described in<br>
the examples hereinbelow, especially the table examples, can be used in the<br>
synthesis in the form of the free acid or likewise in the form of their salts, preferably<br>
alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Example 1<br>
30 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder which contains the scarlet disazo<br>
dye of formula (1-1)<br>
in a 75% fraction and 70 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the<br>
red azo dye of the formula (II-1)<br>
in a 70% fraction are mechanically mixed with each other.<br>

sulfamic acid solution, the diazo suspension obtained is pumped into an aqueous<br>
solution of 397 parts of the scarlet monoazo dye of the formula (15-1)<br>
which was obtained by diazotization of 180.5 parts of 2-amino-5-(b-sulfatoethyl-<br>
sulfonyl)benzenesulfonic acid with 87 parts of 40% sodium nitrite solution in an acidic<br>

7-acetylamino-4-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid are subsequently added as a<br>
second coupling component and pH 5 - 6 is set at below 25Â°C and maintained with<br>
sodium carbonate.<br>
The 65 : 35 mixture of the two dyes (I-3) and (II-2) which is formed after the coupling<br>
reaction has ended can be isolated by evaporation under reduced pressure or by<br>
spray drying; alternatively, the dye solution obtained can also be buffered at<br>
pH 5.5 - 6 by addition of a phosphate buffer and be further diluted or concentrated to<br>
provide a liquid brand of defined strength.<br>
