REMOTE CORIOLIS FLOWMETER SIZING AND ORDERING SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to Coriolis mass flowmeters. More particulariy, this invention relates to a computer system for receiving customer orders of Coriolis flowmeters. Still more particulariy, this invention relates to a system executed by a server which a customer may access from a remote system and input desired flow parameters and be given choices of Coriolis mass flowmeters to select from to order.<br>
Problem<br>
A Coriolis mass flowmeter measures mass flow and other information of materials flowing through a conduit in the flowmeter. Exemplary Coriolis flowmeters are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,109,524 of August 29,1978, 4,491,025 of January 1, 1985, and Re. 31,450 of February 11, 1982, all to J, E. Smith et al. These flowmeters have one or more conduits of straight or curved configuration. Each conduit configuration has a set of natural vibration modes, which may be of a simple bending, torsional or coupled type. Each conduit is driven to oscillate at resonance in one of these natural modes. Material flows into the flowmeter from a connected pipeline on the inlet side of the flowmeter, is directed through the conduit or conduits, and exits the flowmeter through the outlet side of the flowmeter. The material flowing through the pipeline may be gas, liquid, solid, and any combination of these three. The natural vibration modes of the vibrating, material filled system are defined in part by the combined mass of the conduits and the material flowing within the conduits.<br>
When there is no flow through the flowmeter, all points along the conduit oscillate due to an applied driver force with identical phase or small initial fixed phase offset. As material begins to flow, Coriolis forces cause each point along the conduit to have a different phase. The phase on the inlet side of the conduit lags the driver, while the phase on the outlet side of the conduit leads the driver. Pick-off sensors on the conduit(s) produce sinusoidal signals representative of the motion of the conduit(s). Signals output from the pick-off sensors are processed to determine the phase difference between the pick-off sensors. The phase difference between two pick-off sensor signals is proportional to the mass flow rate of material through the conduit{s).<br><br>
There are many different models of Coriolis flowmeters. Micro Motion Inc. of Boulder Colorado markets many types of Coriolis flowmeters.    It is a problem for a user to determine a proper model of Coriolis flowmeter to be used in measuring mass flow rates through a pipeline.<br>
In order to determine the flowmeter model of the proper size and parameters for a pipeline, flow stream parameters for the pipeline must be known. Flow stream parameters include material flow rate, material density, material viscosity, material temperature, material operating pressure. From these flow stream parameters, parameters for a flowmeter to insert into the pipeline can be determined. Flowmeter parameters include meter accuracy, pressure loss, and material velocity. The flowmeter parameters and flow stream parameters are used to determine the models . of flowmeters that can be used to measure mass flow rate in the pipeline.<br>
It is common to use software programs executed by a computer to determine the proper model. However, this requires that meter selection and sizing occur on premises where the computer executing the software resides. Heretofore, there has been no way for a user to log onto a computer to remotely access sizing software and order a desired flowmeter withoul the intervention of a human operator.<br>
Solution The above and other problems are solved and an advance in the art is made by a remote, sizing and ordering system for a Coriolis flowmeter in accordance with this invention. The present invention allows a user to log in via a networi
In accordance with this invention, a method is provided for remote ordering and configuring of a flowmeter. For the method, a server connects to a computer used by a user that is remotely located from the server. The computer communicates with the server over a network, such as the Internet. The server receives input flow stream parameters from the computer. The server determines flowmeter parameters from the input flow stream parameters. The server detemnines whether one of the flowmeters is suitable for the flowmeter parameters. The server transmits information<br><br>
on the flowmeters to the computer over the network. The computer displays the howmeter information to the user. The server receives a selection of one of the flowmeters by the user. The sender receives the selection from the computer over the network. The server transmits an order for the selected flowmeter to a department. Based on the order, the department ships the selected flowmeter to the user. After the user receives said select flowmeter, the selected flowmeter is remotely configured by connecting the selected flowmeter to the server through the computer.<br>
The server may transmit a display to the remote computer of configuration options. The user selects the configuration options and transmits the selected options to the sen/er. The server receives the configuration options from the user. Some of .the configuration options include a process connection type, the process connection size, a power supply type which may include either Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC). and whether to have a local display.<br>
The server may receive the following input flow stream parameters; a flow rate of material, a density of material, a viscosity of material, a temperature of material, and a material operating pressure. The server calculates the following flowmeter parameters from the input flow stream parameters. The flowmeter parameters include meter accuracy, pressure loss and fluid velocity.<br>
After the user has configured a flowmeter, the flowmeter configuration may be stored in an electronic shopping cart. The customer then places an order for a flowmeter fronri configured flowmeters in the shopping cart. The server generates a message and transmits the order to a manufacturing department that produces and ships the flowmeter to the customer.<br>

FIG. 3 illustrating an exemplary processing system;<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention relates to a system for providing remote ordering and sizing for a Coriolis flowmeter, FIG, 1 illustrates an exemplary Coriolis flowmeter that may provides a mass flow rate or other process parameter. Coriolis flowmeter (100) includes a flowmeter assembly (110) and meter electronics (150). Meter electronics (150) are connected to a meter assembly (110) via leads (120) to provide density, mass-flow-rate, volume-flow-rate, and totalized mass-flow rate infomiation over a path (175).<br>
A Coriolis flowmeter structure is described although it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention could be practiced in conjunction with any apparatus having a vibrating conduit to measure properties of material flowing through the conduit.  A second example of such an apparatus is a vibrating tube<br><br>
densitometer which does not have the additional measurement capability provided by a Coriolis mass flowmeters.<br>
Meter assembly (110) includes a pair of flanges (101) and (101'), manifold (102) and conduits (103A) and (103B). Driver (104), pick-off sensors (105) and (105'), and temperature sensor (107) are connected to conduits (103A) and (103B). Brace bars (106) and (106') serve to define the axis (W) and (W*) about which each conduit oscillates.<br>
When Coriolis flowmeter (100) is inserted into a pipeline system (not shown) which carries the process material that is being measured, material enters flowmeter assembly (110) through flange (101), passes through manifold (102) where the material is directed to enter conduits (103A) and (103B). The material then flows through conduits (103A) and (103B) and back into manifold (102) from where it exits meter assembly (110) through flange (101').<br>
Conduits (103A) and (103B) are selected and appropriately mounted to the manifold (102) so as to have substantially the same mass distribution, moments of inertia and elastic modules about bending axes (W-W) and (W'-W), respectively. The conduits (103A-103B) extend outwardly from the manifold in an essentially parallel fashion.<br>
Conduits (103A-103B) are driven by driver (104) in opposite directions about their respective bending axes (W and W) and at what is termed the first out of phase bending mode of the flowmeter. Driver (104) may comprise any one of many well known arrangements, such as a magnet mounted to conduit (103A) and an opposing coil mounted to conduit (103B) and through which an alternating current is passed for vibrating both conduits. A suitable drive signal is applied by meter electronics (150) to driver (104) via path (112).<br>
Pick-off sensors (105) and (105*) are affixed to at least one of conduits (103A) and (103B) on opposing top ends of the conduit to measure oscillation of the conduits. As the conduit (103A-103B) vibrates, pick-off sensors (105-105') generate a first and second pick-off signals. The first and second pick-off signals are applied to paths (111) and (111'). The driver signal is applied to path (112).<br>
Temperature sensor (107) is affixed to at least one conduit (103A) and/or (103B). Temperature sensor(107) measures the temperature of the conduit to modify<br><br>
equations for the temperature of the system. Path (111") carries temperature signals from temperature sensor (107) to meter electronics (150).<br>
Meter electronics (150) receives the first and second pick-off signals on paths (111) and (111'), respectively. Meter electronics (150) processes the first and second velocity signals to compute the mass flow rate, the density, or other property of the material passing through flowmeter assembly (110). This computed information is applied by meter electronics (150) over path (125) to a utilization means (not shown). It is known to those skilled in the art that Coriolis flowmeter (100) is similar in structure to a vibrating tube densitometer Vibrating tube densitometers also utilize a vibrating tube through which fluid flows or, in the case of a sample-type densitometer, within which fluid is held. Vibrating tube densitometers also employ a drive system for exciting the conduit to vibrate. Vibrating tube densitometers typically utilize only single feedback signal since a density measurement requires only the measurement of frequency and a phase measurement is not necessary. The descriptions of the pr^-ent invention herein apply equally to vibrating tube densitometers.<br>
In Coriolis flowmeter (100), the meter electronics (150) are physically divided into (2) components a host system (170) and a signal conditioner (160). In conventional meter electronics, these components are housed in one unit.<br>
Signal conditioner (160) includes drive circuitry (163) and sensor signal conditioning circuitry (161). One skilled in the art will recognize that in actuality drive circuitry (163) and pick-off conditioning circuitry (161) may be separate analog circuits or may be separate functions provided by a digital signal processor or other digital components. Drive circuitry (163) generates a drive signal and applies an altemating drive current to driver (104) via path (112) of path (120). The circuitry of the present invention may be included in drive circuitry (163) to provide an alternating current to driver (104).<br>
Path (112) contains a first and a second lead. Drive circuitry (163) is communicatively connected to sensorsignal conditioning circuitry (161) via path (162). Path (162) allows drive circuitry to monitor the incoming pick-off signals to adjust the drive signal. Power to operate drive circuitry (163) and sensor signal conditioning circuitry (161) is supplied from host system (170) via a first path (173) and a second path (174), That may be a part of a conventional 2-wire, 4-wire cable, or a portion of a multi-pair cable.<br><br>
Sensor signal conditioning circuitry (161) receives signals from first pick-off (105), second pick-off (105*), and temperature sensor (107) via paths (111,111') and (111"). Sensor signal conditioning circuitry (161) determines the frequency of the pick-off signals and may also determine properties of a material flowing through conduits (103A-103B). After the frequency of the input signals from pick-off sensors (105-105') and properties of the material are determined, parameter signals carrying this infomnation are generated and transmitted to a secondary processing unit (171) in host system (170) via path (176).<br>
Host system (170) includes a power supply (172) and secondary processing unit (171). Power supply (172) receives electricity from a source and converts the received electricity to the proper power needed by the system. Secondary processing unit (171) receives the parameter signals from pick-off signal conditioning circuitry (161) and may perfonm processes needed to provide properties of the material flowing through conduits (103A-103B) needed by a user. Such properties may include but are not limited to density, mass flow rate, and volumetric flow rate.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a typical intemet connection which may be used to embody the invention. In FIG. 2, remote client computer system (210) is at a customer site. Remote client computer (210) uses a modem or other networking device to connect to sep/er(230). If a modem is used, remote client computer (210) connects to telephone network (220) which provides a dial up connection to server (230).   Server (230) is an Intemet Service Provider (ISP) for remote client computer (210). Server (230) connects via Intemet (240) to Sen/er (250). One skiHed in the art will appreciate that Intemet (240) is a network of computers that are communicatively connected. Server (250) is a sen/er of a provider of this invention that executes processes in accordance with this invention.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a processing system (300) that is exemplary of the computer systems such as remote client computer (210) and servers (250) and (230).<br>
Processing system (300) includes central processing unit (CPU) (301) capable of executing instructions stored in a memory attached to CPU (301).   CPU (301) is attached to a memory bus (310) via path (303). Memory bus (310) is connected to Read Only Memory (ROM) (320) via path (321) and to Random Access Memory<br><br>
(RAM) (330) via path (331).   ROM (320) stores instructions used by CPU (301) to control the functions performed by processing system (300). RAM (330) stores instructions such as the operating system and currently running applications, to be executed by CPU (301) as well as the data needed to perform the instructions. CPU (301) reads and writes data to RAM (330) via path (331) and bus (310),<br>
CPU (301) is connected to I/O bus (340) via path (304). I/O bus (340) connects CPU (301) to peripheral devices to transmit data between CPU (301) and the peripheral devices. In the preferred exemplary embodiment, the peripheral devices connected to I/O bus (340) include keyboard (350), mouse (360), display (370). nonvolatile memory (disk drive) (380), and modem (390). Keyboard (350) is connected to I/O bus (340) via path (341) and allows a user to input data.

Nonvolatile memory (380) is a disk drive which can read and write data to a disk or other type of media to store the data for future use and is connected to I/O bus (340) via path (344). Modem (390) is a device which facilitates a connection of processing system (300) to telephone line (391) for communication with other computers such as a server for an Intemet connection. Modem (390) is connected to I/O bus (340) via path (345).<br>
Process (400) is a process executed by a server to provide remote sizing and order of Coriolis flowmeters. Process (400) is a program written in a language such as Java or other language that facilitates communication between computers. Process (400) begins in step (405) by generating a display requesting flow stream parameters from a customer. The display may a screen or page with fields to be filled by customer. In step (410), the sen/er transmits the display to the client remote computer system.<br>
In step (415), the sen/er receives input flow stream parameters from a customer. The customer inputs the parameters into the remote computer which transmits the input flow stream parameters to the server.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a process (500) for receiving input flow stream parameters. Process (500) begins in step (505) by receiving a flow rate of a material to flow<br><br>
through the flowmeter from a remote computer. In step (510), the server receives a viscosity of the material to flow through the flowmeter. The server then receives a temperature of material to flow through the flowmeter in step (515). In step (517). the server receives a density of the material to flow through the flowmeter. Process (500) ends in step (520) in which the server receives an operating pressure of the material to flow through the flowmeter. One skilled in the art will know that other flow stream parameters may be added, but this is left to those skilled in the art.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 4, process (400) continues in step (420) by detennining flowmeter parameters from the input flow stream parameters. FIG.6 illustrates a process (600) executed by the sen/er to calculate flowmeter parameters.<br>
Process (600) begins in step (605) by calculating flowmeter accuracy for the input flow stream parameters. In step (610), the server calculates pressure loss of the flow across the flowmeter based upon the input flow stream parameters. In step (615). process (600) as the server calculates fluid velocity from the input flow stream parameters.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 4, process (400) continues by determining at least one model of flowmeter that has tolerances acceptable for the determined flowmeter parameters in step (425). A display including all of the determined models is generated in step (430) and is transmitted to the remote client system in step (435). In step (440). the server receives a selection of one of the determined models. In response to receiving the selection, the sen/er transmits a display of configuration options to the remote client computer system in step (445). In step (450), the server receives configuration options from the customer via the remote client computer system. FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary process (700) for receiving configuration options from the remote client computer.<br>
Process (700) begins in step (705) by receiving a type and size of process connection. One skilled in the art will recognize that a process connection is a flange or other device used to connect the flowmeter into a pipeline. In step (710), the server receives a type of power supply to connect to the flowmeter. One skilled in the art will recognize that these may include either (AC) or (DC) power supply and may supply any different ranges of cun^ents. These are left to designers of flowmeters. Process (700) ends in step (715) with the server receiving a request for a local display. One<br><br>
skilled in the art will recognize that any of these configurations may be left out or others added depending upon the designer of the system.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 4. process (400) continues in step (455) by storing a configured flowmeter in an electronic shopping cart. An electronic shopping cart is a database that stores configured flowmeters for a customer to choose from when making an order. It should be noted that steps (405) through (455) may be repeated any number of times by a user from almost any step in process (400) to design many different flowmeters for different uses and/or to order multiple flowmeters.<br>
In step (460), the server receives an order for a configured flowmeter. This may be done by the user selecting one of the flowmeters stored in an electric shopping cart or may be received as the customer finishes configuring a flowmeter. In response to -receiving an order, the server transmits a display requesting billing infonnation from the customer in step (465). The request may be for a billing address, a credit card account or other form of creating and/or crediting an account.<br>
In step (470). the server receives the billing information which is then stored for future use in billing. In step (475), the server transmits an order to a manufacturing department which will make the flowmeter and ship the flowmeter to the customer. The order may be transmitted in an e-mail message or other such manner that ncludes all of the configuration data for the flowmeter.<br>
After the flowmeter is sent to the customer, the flowmeter may be remotely :onfigured in step (477) by connecting a remote computer connected to the flowmeter :o the server. Process (500) then ends.<br><br><br>
