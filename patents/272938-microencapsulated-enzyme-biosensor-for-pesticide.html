				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an enzyme biosensor device. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to an improved device for amperometric estimation of carbamate or<br>
organo-phosphorous based pesticides in a given liquid sample by way of improved<br>
immobilization of microencapsulated enzyme thereby enhancing the efficacy of the<br>
device. The invention also relates to a method for producing microencapsulated electrode<br>
for amperometric estimation of pesticides in a given liquid sample.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
In modern days the rampant use of organophosphorus-based pesticides is creating high<br>
risk of health hazards. Farmers all over the world use organophosphorus-based pesticides<br>
and insecticides extensively.<br>
These neurotoxic compounds are highly toxic because of their inhibitory effect on<br>
cholinesterase enzymes essential for the functioning of the central nervous system in<br>
humans and insects. As acetylcholinesterase (AChE) promotes the hydrolysis of natural<br>
neurotransmitter, acetylcholin (ACh), its inhibition terminates the propagation of the<br>
nerve impulse.<br>
In a recent US geological survey study, widespread presence of trace amounts of these<br>
pesticides was found in surface and ground waters across the US. A similar presence of<br>
the deadly organophosphorus could be expected in the water resources across India.<br>
So, there is a need for development of sensitive methods for the detection of<br>
cholinesterase inhibitors for both environmental monitoring and clinical diagnosis.<br>
Traditionally, pesticides residues could be measured by the methods of liquid<br>
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography<br>
2-<br><br>
(HPLC), immunoassay e.g. enzyme linked immuno sorbant assay (Elisa) etc. Highly<br>
sensitive HPLC or GC procedures were also developed for the analytical determination of<br>
these pesticides. However, these processes were not very effective, as the amount of<br>
pesticide could not be measured precisely.<br>
Prior art discuss about biosensor, screen-printed biosensor, electrical biosensor, receptor-<br>
based biosensor and spectroscopic methods for detection of chemical toxins.<br>
Most biosensor discussed in prior art consists of enzymes that are immobilized by means<br>
of covalent bonds. Immobilizing the enzymes by means of covalent bond reduces the<br>
enzyme activity and hence efficiency of biosensor.<br>
Immobilization is a process by which the biomaterials are held firmly on the transducer<br>
surface. The process has been widely used by researchers in biosensors. Some examples<br>
are adsorption, covalent bonding, cross-linking etc. The water-in-oil emulsions are<br>
produced with a particular emulsifier such that the aqueous phase is inside a thin layer of<br>
the organic phase (polymer). This was sprayed through a spray drier to form beads of<br>
polymer having the biomaterial inside it.<br>
US6406876 describes a method for detecting hazardous chemicals using biosensor. The<br>
biosensor consists of enzymes that are immobilized on or inside a porous or a non-porous<br>
support by covalent bonds. Covalent bonding of the enzyme with the support reduces<br>
enzyme activity.<br>
US5001048 describes electrical biosensor containing a biological receptor immobilized<br>
and stabilized in a protein film. In case of binding a biological receptor in a protein film<br>
the key mechanism of binding is covalent bonding.<br>
US4324858 describes immobilization of enzyme by impregnation into a porous material.<br>
The porous sheet, which has been used, is difficult to fix on the working electrode. Also<br>
the covalent bonding has been encouraged by using sulphonic, amine groups etc.<br>
3<br><br>
US5192507 discloses a method of immobilizing and stabilizing an active biological<br>
receptor in a polymeric film and receptor-based biosensor for determining an analyte of<br>
interest in a sample. In case of immobilization of enzyme in a polymeric film by<br>
materials capable of polymerizing and a polymerizing agent may result in covalent<br>
bonding of the enzyme in the polymeric film.<br>
US4411989 describes methods and devices for identifying substances (such as chemical<br>
warfare agents) and residual environmental pollutants (such as pesticides). These utilize<br>
the discovery that spectra of an uninhibited enzyme (e.g., a cholinesterase) can differ<br>
from spectra of the same enzyme, which has been complexed with the agent pollutant.<br>
Analysis by spectroscopic method has lower sensitivity.<br>
None of the prior art discussed above describe bulk polymerization technique for<br>
improved immobilization of microencapsulated enzyme in amperometric estimation of<br>
pesticides for a given liquid sample.<br>
Basic reaction for determination of pesticide :<br>
Enzyme AchE (acetycholine eaterase) hydrolyzes acetylcholine and acetic acid<br><br>
The choline is oxidized by oxygen catalyzed by the enzyme ChO (choline oxidase) and<br>
H2O2 is produced in the process.<br><br><br>
Since H2O2 produced has a very low concentration, it may not be detected by direct<br>
electrochemical route. However good signals can be obtained for a low level (ppb) using<br>
TMB and HRP. The TMB is rapidly oxidized by H2O2 in presence of HRP added to the<br>
system. Due to redox reaction there will be exchange of electrons at the working<br>
electrode.<br><br>
Thus amperometry can be done for indirect detection of H2O2.<br>
Acetylcholine esterase is partly deactivated by organo-phosphorous (OP) based pesticides<br>
5<br>
due to formation of permanent covalent bond.<br><br><br>
Thus there is a need for providing a device for amperometric estimation of pesticides in a<br>
given liquid sample by way of improved immobilization of microencapsulated enzyme<br>
thereby enhancing the efficacy of the device. There is also a need to provide for a method<br>
for producing microencapsulated electrode for amperometric estimation of pesticides in a<br>
given liquid sample.<br>
Thus the present inventors have found that amperometric estimation of carbamate or<br>
organo-phosphorous based pesticides in a given liquid sample can be achieved by way of<br>
improved immobilization of microencapsulated enzyme by bulk polymerization thereby<br>
providing enhancement in overall efficiency of the device.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a device for amperometric<br>
estimation of pesticides in a given liquid sample by way of improved immobilization of<br>
microencapsulated enzyme.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing microencapsulated<br>
electrode for use in amperometric estimation of pesticides in a given liquid sample.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide bulk polymerization.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a simple, efficient and cost effective<br>
method for amperometric estimation of pesticides.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a microencapsulated<br>
enzyme biosensor device for amperometric estimation of carbamate and/or an<br>
organophosphorus based pesticides in a given sample, said device comprising :<br>
6<br><br>
plurality of electrodes including reference/counter electrode and working electrode,<br>
wherein said working electrode comprising a loop so as to ensure adhesion of<br>
polyacrylamide hydrogel, and<br>
wherein said counter electrode having relatively large area than the working electrode.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for producing immobilized<br>
micro-encapsulated with minimum loss of enzyme activity, said method comprising steps<br>
of:<br>
spray drying of an emulsion comprising predetermined quantity of acetylcholine esterase<br>
enzyme dissolved in phosphate buffer forming an aqueous phase and organic phase<br>
prepared with cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) to<br>
form encapsulated CAB enzyme powder; and<br>
further immobilizing said encapsulated enzyme powder by hydrogel being formed by<br>
bulk polymerization of a mediator selectively comprising acrylamide monomer, N,N<br>
methylene-bis-acrylamide (BIS) and glutaraldehyde and an initiator being selectively<br>
potassium peroxodisulphate.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to provide a microencapsulated enzyme biosensor for<br>
amperometric estimation of pesticides. The biosensor consists of two electrodes namely<br>
reference/counter electrode made of silver wire and working electrode made of platinum<br>
wire. However, this does not restrict the scope of the present invention. Graphite, glassy<br>
carbon, gold, rhodium etc. can be used as working electrode. But platinum is the best<br>
choice due to its inertness and selectivity. Moreover platinum electrode can operate at a<br>
much lower applied potential compared to that of other electrodes. At higher applied<br>
potential other electrodes also respond to all other electro-active components in the<br>
sample. Silver/silver chloride system or calomel electrode may be used as true reference<br>
7<br><br>
electrode. Silver may be used as pseudo reference electrode to reduce the size of the three<br>
electrode assembly. Calomel electrode is not preferred due to environmental hazard.<br>
All the wires are coated with some insulation selected from PVC tubing, glass capillary,<br>
epoxy coating etc. and the like. In case of glass capillary or PVC tubing the ends are<br>
sealed by heating or by epoxy. These coated electrodes are set on a polyester matrix using<br>
adhesives. Polymer or glass separators are placed to avoid short circuit between<br>
electrodes. Loops are made at the end of reference and working electrode. The loop at the<br>
terminal of the working electrode ensures adhesion of polyacrylamide hydrogel.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the terminal of the counter electrode has<br>
been coiled to ensure larger area compared to that of the working electrode.<br>
Preparation of microencapsulated enzyme:<br>
Microencapsulated enzyme is produced by spray drying technique. A mini spray drier<br>
(model no. B191, Buchi, Germany) is used for this purpose with an airflow rate-800 ml/s;<br>
pressure 500 KN/m2 and temperature 45 °C. Measured quantity of acetylcholine esterase<br>
enzyme is dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 to form the aqueous phase. The organic<br>
phase is prepared with CAB dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM). These two were then<br>
emulsified with SPAN-85. The emulsion then fed into the spray dryer in co current mode.<br>
The encapsulated CAB enzyme powder is separated by the cyclone separator and<br>
collected.<br>
Immobilization of the sensing element on the working electrode:<br>
Microencapsulated AchE (0.03U), ChO (0.03U), HRP (10U) and TMB (0.1 mg) are<br>
immobilized directly on the tip of a Platinum wire (working electrode) by bulk<br>
polymerization of acrylamide monomer, BIS (0 to 10% w/w of amount of monomer,<br>
preferably 4%) and glutaraldehyde (0 to 10% v/w of amount of monomer, preferably 1%)<br>
as crosslinkers, Ferrocene carboxylic acid (0.001 to 0.1% w/w of amount of monomer,<br>
8<br><br>
preferably 0.01%) as mediator and potassium peroxodisulphate (0.1 to 20% w/w of<br>
amount of monomer, preferably 5%) as initiator.<br>
Bi-functional molecules containing -NH2,-CHO,-COOH as functional groups can be<br>
used as cross linkers. N,N methylene-bis-acrylamide (BIS) is preferred as it forms<br>
irreversible gel. Increase in concentration of BIS makes the gel brittle. On the other hand<br>
glutaraldehyde provides flexibility to the gel. Thus the simultaneous uses of the two cross<br>
linkers helped preparation of a stable and workable gel with proper cross-link density.<br>
Mediators like ferrocene, ferrocene carboxylic acid, potassium ferricyanide etc. can be<br>
used. In the present invention ferrocene carboxylic acid is preferred to ferrocene due to<br>
its solubility in water. Potassium ferricyanide is not preferred due to its inhibitory effect<br>
on polymerization.<br>
Initiators that generate free radicals can be used. Thus initiators like benzoyl peroxide and<br>
ammonium peroxodisulphate can be used. The potassium perdisulphate is preferred as it<br>
ensures faster polymerization at room temperature.<br>
The biosensor device as described above can be used for estimation of any hazardous<br>
chemicals that can deactivate the enzyme Acetylcholine esterase.<br>
Estimation of pesticide: The microencapsulated polymer electrode was dipped in liquid<br>
sample containing pesticide for 15 minutes. It was then washed with buffer and dried in<br>
air. The treated microencapsulated polymer electrode and silver electrode were partly<br>
dipped into phosphate buffer containing 3mM KCL, pH 7.4 and amperometry was done<br>
at -0.25V. The microencapsulated polymer electrode acts as a working electrode and the<br>
silver electrode was used as pseudo reference electrode and counter electrode. After<br>
equilibrium measured quantity of Acetylcholine chloride solution was added.<br>
Reactions for the estimation of pesticides:<br>
The enzyme Acetylcholine esterase hydrolyzes Acetylcholine to choline and acetic acid.<br>
9<br><br><br>
Since H2O2 produced has a very low concentration, it may not be detected by direct<br>
electrochemical route. However, good signals are obtained for a low level (ppb) using<br>
TMB and HRP. The TMB is rapidly oxidized by H2O2 in presence of HRP added to the<br>
system. Due to redox reaction there will be exchange of electrons at the working<br>
electrode.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of the micro encapsulated biosensor of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates calibration curve for organophosphorous based pesticide.<br>
10<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
As illustrated in figure 1 the biosensor comprise working platinum electrode (1) which is<br>
placed parallel to reference/counter silver electrode (2) The working electrode (1) as well<br>
as the reference electrode (2) are coated with insulation coating (3). Since the biosensor is<br>
constructed as described above, there can be obtained a biosensor in which the respective<br>
electrodes are surely separated. This separator (4) is placed to avoid short circuit between<br>
electrodes (1) and (2). Two electrodes (1) and (2) are set on a polyester matrix (5). Loop<br>
(6) is made at the end of working electrode (1). Loop (6) is such that it ensures adhesion<br>
of microencapsulated enzyme acrylamide polymer hydrogel (7).<br>
In figure 2 calibration curve for organophosphorous based pesticide is illustrated. With<br>
increase in concentration of the pesticide there will be more deactivation of the enzyme<br>
acetylcholine esterase. Thus at a specified time interval less choline will be produced by<br>
oxidation of the substrate acetylcholine chloride due to the catalytic effect of the<br>
deactivated enzyme AchE.<br>
The amount of hydrogen peroxide produced by the action of ChO is directly proportional<br>
to the amount of choline produced by the earlier reaction. Again the amperometric<br>
response of TMB is proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The graph shows that there is a linear decrease in rate of change in current with increase<br>
in concentration of pesticide. To check whether the sensors were able to give<br>
reproducible results, each experiment was repeated thrice. The error bars based on<br>
standard deviation value indicate that the responses are clustered closely around the mean<br>
i.e., the responses are reproducible.<br>
