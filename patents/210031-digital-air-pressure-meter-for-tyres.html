				<td>The Digital air pressure meter for tyres consists of an air sensor assembly which is screwed to the air nozzle of the tubes in the tyre. The main parts of the air sensor are the diaphragm, ram, upper and lower contacts. In the normal position, the top of the ram is midway between the upper and lower contacts. As the air pressure becomes more or less than a particular extent, the diaphragm expands or contracts which moves the ram up or down, making it touch the upper or lower contacts which complete the circuit and thus signal is passed that some problem is there. The signals through the sensors are passed through the wires attached to the transmitter which is mounted on the center of the wheel. The signal is received by a wireless receiver placed suitably which in turn is connected to a display unit which displays the tyre number and bells an alarm in case problem is there with the tyre pressure. One sensors and transmitter are attached to each single wheel and for the twin wheels, two sensors and transmitter are required. Each signal is encoded by the transmitter and decoded at the receiver so as to distinguish, from which wheel the signal is coming.</td>

Digital air pressure meter for tyres<br>
BAWA JAGJEET KUMAR<br>
WADI NAKA,10,Popular Society 86,<br>
Nagpur-23<br>
An Indian National<br>
17-7-2007<br><br><br>
The following specification particularlydes this invention and the manner in which it is to^b€perfofmed-*<br>
Title of Invention:<br>
Digital air pressure meter for tyres<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a digital air pressure meter,particularly<br>
digital air pressure meter for vehicle,more particularly a digital air<br>
pressure meter for four wheeler.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
There are various types of devices available for detecting amount of<br>
air in tyres for vehicles in transportation sector. The existing<br>
devices are not suitable for the inner tyre in twin tyre system.For<br>
instance refilling of air is impossible as gap between the two tyre is<br>
less in patent no. GB1286540.<br>
It is also impossible to plugin or plug out the cap of air nozzle as<br>
human hand cannot penetrate this small gap.<br>
Further the threaded portion meant to be fitted on tyre nozzle is<br>
insufficient so there is a chance of nozzle break up and the airvent<br>
size is fixed too.<br>
The most important draw back in the prior art is that the device<br>
indicates the lower pressure of the tyres by a buzzer.The driver<br>
2<br><br>
does not come to know about the exact tyre having the problem.The driver has to check all the tyres and it becomes very difficult at night.So there was a problem in the prior art regarding intimation of the tyre number to the driver.<br>
The main utility of the device is to aid the driver while driving long distances regarding the pressure of the air in the tyres so that the fuel efficiency can be achieved, unnecessary damage to the tyres as well as the tubes can be avoided and unnecessary delays can be avoided which will result in the cost savings.<br>
Object of the Invention."<br>
The primary object of this invention is to obviate the drawbacks in the prior art and to provide an electromechanical device which will gives an indication to the driver of the vehicle about the condition of the pressure of the air inside all of its tyre in case it goes above or below a certain level so that corrective action can be taken in time to save the tyre and tube from further damage.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
According to the current invention there is provided a Digital air pressure meter for tyres comprising an air sensor assembly, the main parts of the air sensor being the diaphragm, ram, upper and lower contacts, said air sensor is screwed to the air nozzle of the<br>
3<br><br>
tubes in the tyre.  In the normal condition , the top of the ram is midway between the upper and lower contacts. As the air pressure becomes more or less than a particular extent, the diaphragm expands or contracts which moves the ram up or down, making it touch the upper or lower contacts which complete an electrical circuit and thus a signal is passed indicating that some problem is there, a transmitter is mounted on the center of the wheel and the signals from the sensors are passed to the transmitter through the wires attached to it. a wireless receiver placed suitably receives The signal and a display unit which in turn is connected to the wirelesss receiver displays the tyre number with abnormal pressure and raises an alarm in case problem is there with the tyre pressure. One sensor and transmitter are attached to each single wheel and for the twin wheels, two sensors and transmitter are required. Each signal is encoded by the transmitter and decoded at the receiver so as to distinguish, from which wheel the signal is coming.<br>
Detail description of the invention<br>
Digital air pressure meter for tyres of the present invention for<br>
which patent is being sought consists of the following parts:<br>
I] * Air Valve [fig(3)l The air valve comprises of the following parts: •   Coupling Nut [fig(3-4)]<br>
4<br><br>
•	Valve Core Pusher Screw [fig(3~5)]<br>
•	Air Lock Washer [fig(3-6)]<br>
•	Connector Nut [fig(3-7)]<br>
•	Air Filling Nozzle [fig(3-9)l<br>
The air valve used for inner wheel is basically a  "T" shaped assembly. One end of which attaches to the nozzle of the tube for sensing of pressure and inflation or deflation. Other end of the "T" form the new nozzle for inflation and deflation of the tyre externally. The air sensor is attached to the vertical limb of T. The coupling nut is fitted on the air nozzle of the tube of the tyre. The valve core pusher screw is tightened over the washer. Then both are fitted to the connecter nut. Thus, it forces air in the air valve which is further connected to the air sensor.<br>
II]	20uter air valve [fig(2-2)]<br>
The outer air valve is similar to the air valve construction wise but is made specially for the outer tyres of the twin tyres. The air nozzle in it is protruding outside for making the air filling easier.<br>
III]	3Air Sensor [fig(4)]<br>
It consists of the following parts-"<br>
•	Bottom Body [fig(4-14)]<br>
5<br><br>
Diaphragm [fig(4-15)]<br>
Ram [fig(4-16)]<br>
Taper Washer [fig(4-17)]<br>
Plain Washer [fig(4-18)]<br>
Spring Pusher Washer [fig(4-19)J<br>
Top Body [fig(4-2D]<br>
Helical Spring [fig(4-20)]<br>
Screw Bolt [fig(4-22)]<br>
Air sensing plate [fig(4-23)]<br>
Helical Spring [fig(4-24)]<br>
Output Wire Clip [fig(4-25)]<br>
Insulated Washer [fig(4-26)]<br>
Centre Threaded top cover [fig(4-27)]<br>
High Air Sensing Screw [fig(4-28)]<br>
The bottom body has a side thread which mounts on the air valve. The bottom body houses a diaphragm on which a ram is fitted. On the ram, a taper washer is fitted. On the taper washer, a plain washer is put which is in the top body. Then the spring pusher washer is fitted and then helical spring is put on it. Then a screw bolt is fitted on the centre of the top body. Then the low air sensing plate is fitted. Then helical spring is put and then output wire clip is<br><br>
put over it on which, insulated washer is put and the centre thread top cover is put over it.<br>
When the air is filled in the bottom body of the sensor, then the air pressure expands the diaphragm and it is lifted up. Diaphragm pushes the ram which in turn pushes the air sensing plate. Thus the continuity of the air sensor is broken.<br>
When the air pressure rises above a particular limit, it lifts the ram which in turn pushes the air sensing plate which touches the high air sensing screw which is attached to the body and thus, it completes the circuit and signal is passed from the sensor.<br>
When the air pressure falls below a particular limit, the ram comes<br>
down and thus the air sensing plate touches the bottom body which<br>
again completes the circuit and thus the signal is passed from the<br>
sensor.<br>
For adjusting the higher pressure limit, high air sensing screw is<br>
adjusted and for adjusting the low pressure limit, the screw bolt is<br>
adjusted.<br>
One of the wires coming out of the air pressure sensor goes to the<br>
transmitter from where the data is transmitted wirelessly to the<br>
receiver which in turn is connected to the display unit and the other<br>
wire is grounded with the body of the vehicle.<br>
7<br><br>
IV]	transmitter [fig(5)]<br>
The transmitter [fig(5-3D] which is having a 315 MHz 5Dual Tone Multi Frequency encoder [fig(5~30..34)] to encode the signal is connected to the sensor. The transmitter sends the coded signal to the receiver which has a decoder connected to it.<br>
V]	Receiver [fig(35)]<br>
The 315 MHz Radio Frequency receiver is provided at the suitable place along with 7DTMF decoder [fig(36)l to decode the signal received from the transmitter.<br>
VI]	8DisplayUnit [fig(5-37)]<br>
The display unit is an electronic device which is connected to the receiver. This unit has a seven segment display, to display the tyre number which has sent the signal.<br>
The material for the above parts can be plastic, metal, alloy or any suitable material from which the parts can be moulded, manufactured and machined for particular tolerances.<br>
