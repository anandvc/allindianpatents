A METHOD OF MANAGING THE SLOT PARKING OF A MOBILE VEHICLE AND DEVICE THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a method of managing the slot parking of a mobile vehicle and device therefor, such as automobiles, robots and motorized trucks, the wheel or wheels of a common axle of which can be locked.<br>
It will find its application on public roads and private parking lots for the slot parking of vehicles and on production sites of companies for the parking of vehicles which serve for example for the packaging of products. It will also be implemented by automobile manufacturers, and manufacturers of robots and motorized trucks.<br>
Slot parking is performed with respect to immediate surroundings which consist of walls, sidewalk curbs, other vehicles and other obstacles such as fire hydrants and posts. However, the maneuver is generally performed so as to position the vehicle between two other vehicles of the same type.<br>
The parking operation is split up into four phases. The first phase is a positioning phase in which the vehicle must be suitably located with respect to immediate obstacles, front and back of the vehicle.<br>
The second phase is a locking phase in which the vehicle moves backward and locks the wheels so as to allow the back of the vehicle to enter the parking space in which it is to be parked.<br>
The third phase of the slot parking is a reverse -locking phase in which the vehicle, once the locking phase has terminated, that is to say once the back of the vehicle is suitably located in the available parking space,  moves backward and reverse-locks the<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FROX/00917<br>
- 2 -<br>
wheels so as likewise to allow the front part of the vehicle to be properly located in the parking space in which it is to be parked.<br>
Once this reverse-locking phase is concluded, the fourth phase consists in realigning the vehicle and to do this, the vehicle moves forward or backward according to the available front and back space, while straightening its wheels.<br>
Among the operators who have to carry out this type of .parking, that is to say the drivers of vehicles, some are more experienced than others sind consequently drivers who are rather inexpert or who are not very skilful in performing the maneuver have to repeat it several times before they succeed in parking suitably. Operators of this type therefore have the drawback of impeding the flow of other vehicles for the time that the maneuver is being carried out and these unaccomplished operators sometimes strike the immediate obstacles and damage them and also their own vehicle, thereby incurring subsequent repair costs and hence additional vehicle servicing costs.<br>
Likewise, certain operators, even accomplished ones, undertake  the  parking  maneuver  without  actually<br>
realizing that the parking space available is not large enough relative to the size of their vehicle. These drivers therefore try to position themselves in the parking zone and then end up being blocked, during the operation, not having sufficient space and running the risk ?of hitting the immediate obstacles. By! being blocked, these drivers therefore also impede the proper operation of the flow of the other vehicles and run the risk of creating damage to immediate obstacles and on their vehicle.<br>
For this purpose, means exist which consist firstly in ensuring that the space available to park the vehicle<br><br>
WO   01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 3 -<br>
in a slot is sufficient depending on the type of vehicle involved. To do this, devices and methods for evaluating the space available are known, these informing the driver as to the possibilities of performing the slot parking maneuver without catching on immediate obstacles and as a function of the si^e of his automobile.<br>
Specifically, the vehicle is equipped with one or more sensors and with evaluation means, a first function of which is to detect the distance which separates the .obstacles front and back of the vehicle between which the driver wishes to park. The device then informs the operator whether he can perform the maneuver with no difficulty and with no risk of catching on immediate obstacles as a function of the size of his vehicle.<br>
Other devices have been developed for implementing a system for managing automatic parking on vehicles, devices developed more especially on motor vehicles. These consist firstly in analyzing the space available in which the driver wishes to park his automobile, then as a function of the space available, the system calculates a vehicle positioning instruction curve. When this instruction curve is calculated, the vehicle is located by action on the wheels, the direction of travel and the speed by following the predefined instruction curve.<br>
This instruction curve is no longer modified once it has been calculated by the system and consequently,<br>
when "the space available alters over time, and while the slot parking is being carried out, the system disregards the various alterations in the surroundings and continues the maneuver on the basis of the predefined instruction curve, thereby running the risk of catching on the immediate surroundings which may be undergoing alteration. For example, when the front or back vehicle starts up again, or when a person enters<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 4 -<br>
the parking zone,  the vehicle nevertheless continues the parking maneuver which it has undertaken.<br>
Moreover, this instruction curve is based on purely mathematical calculation rules which do not correspond exactly with the natural maneuver customarily employed by the driver. So much so that the driver does not feel safe during the conduct of the maneuver which is performed differently from his customary practice. All of a sudden the driver may wish to interrupt the maneuver and retake control of the vehicle without having any valid reason to do so, similarly - impeding the proper operation of the flow of traffic.<br>
The present invention aims to remedy the drawbacks of the existing systems and one of the main aims is to propose a system for managing the slot parking of a mobile vehicle which is founded on gradual qualitative rules based on human expertise, so as to reconstruct the parking maneuver which is as close as possible to that which the expert or accomplished operator would have performed manually without any assistance.<br>
To do this, the invention has the advantage of giving operating  instructions  for  action  on  the  control<br>
members of the vehicle which are effected as the maneuver progresses and after having analyzed the position which the vehicle has reached with respect to its immediate surroundings, by retrieving the information regarding distance, orientation and direction of travel by means of the sensors. The action on the control members being effected moreover in a qualitative manner such as would be effected by an operator driving manually who reacts according to the progress of events.<br>
The invention also has the advantage of "allowing the use of sensors providing rather inaccurate measurements,  either  because  these  sensors  are  of<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 5 -<br>
medium quality and low cost, or because the sensors are complex as regards their fine-tuning. Specifically, the data transmitted need not necessarily be very accurate since they are then transformed into gradual qualitative data.<br>
Moreover, the invention has the advantage of verifying, during the vehicle parking operation, whether the vehicle's immediate surroundings have not altered with respect to the start of the maneuver. Specifically, the position of the vehicle with respect to the immediate surroundings is measured during the progress of the maneuver and in the case where an additional obstacle, for example a person, were to enter the parking zone, the system detects this and reacts instantaneously either by rectifying the maneuver, if the latter is still achievable, or by interrupting the slot parking if the distance between the additional obstacle and the vehicle is deemed to be too dangerous.<br>
The invention also has the advantage of being very flexible as regards the choice and the definition of the gradual qualitative rules which are founded on human expertise and experience. Specifically, the choice of these rules may be very wide and as a direct consequence thereof, depending on the complexity or simplicity chosen, the number of operating instructions for acting on the wheels, the direction of travel and the speed of the vehicle is increased or decreased.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that it<br>
allows the operator to retake control of the vehicle at any instant, simply by manipulating the vehicle's control members such as the steering wheel, the brake pedal or the gearbox, thereby improving the feeling of wellbeing and of safety of the driver who can interrupt the maneuver if he deems it necessary to do so or'if he wishes to change space at the last moment.<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 6 -<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to make the operator safe during the parking maneuver. To do this, the invention has the advantage of informing the operator directly if the latter so wishes regarding the operations to be performed on the control members of the vehicle. In this case, the operator plays the role of actuator directly and is controlled by the information received visually, aurally.- or kinesthetically {tactile aspect). Kinesthetic is understood to mean the informing of the driver through sensory actions on the hands, the feet, or any "other part of the body in physical contact ..with the interior of the vehicle.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for managing the slot parking of a mobile vehicle which can be used to park any type of motorized vehicle, the wheels of a common axle of which can be locked, with respect to the immediate surroundings which may be found on public roads, private parking lots and production sites of enterprises, said slot parking consisting of at least two phases, namely a locking phase and a reverse-locking phase, and possibly of two other phases, namely a positioning phase which precedes the two locking and reverse-locking phases and a realignment phase which follows the reverse-locking phase, said method using measurement sensors for measuring distance, orientation and speed which make it possible to evaluate the space available with respect to the immediate surroundings so as to perform the parking maneuver, the latter being carried out by operating on the speed, the direction of travel and the relative lock of the wheels of the vehicle, characterized in that, in order to carry out parking:<br>
-	the  input  data  originating  from  the  measurement<br>
sensors  which  provide  quantitative  values  are<br>
retrieved/<br>
-	some  of   these  quantitative  input  values   are<br>
translated into gradual qualitative input values,<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
-	on  the  basis  of  qualitative  rules,   operating<br>
instructions are determined which provide gradual<br>
qualitative output data and quantitative output data,<br>
-	these gradual qualitative output data are transformed<br>
into quantitative output data,<br>
-	the actuators of the vehicle are controlled as a<br>
function of the quantitative output data obtained.<br>
It also makes reference to the device for managing the slot parking of a mobile vehicle which implements the method, characterized in that it comprises:<br>
-	measurement sensors for measuring the distance of the<br>
vehicle with respect to surrounding obstacles, speeds<br>
sensors,  direction of  travel  sensors  and vehicle<br>

-	a computer which retrieves the quantitative data from<br>
the measurement sensors and transforms the input data<br>
into gradual qualitative values and into quantitative<br>
values, processes and determines output instructions<br>
which   have   gradual   qualitative   values   and<br>
quantitative  values  and  transforms  these  output<br>
instructions into quantitative values,<br>
-	actuators which act on the movements of the vehicle<br>
as  a  function of  the  quantitative  output  values<br>
transmitted by the computer or an output interface<br>
which   transmits   visual   and/or  audible   and/or<br>
kinesthetic information to the driver to guide him in<br>
his maneuver.<br>

The present invention relates to a method and device for managing slot parking of a mobile vehicle (1) , where a vehicle {1) is understood to mean any motorized vehicle whose wheels belonging to a common axle may be locked, such as for example motor vehicles which travel on public or private roads and which have to be slot parked in a parking zone {2) with respect to immediate<br>
surrounding obstacles (3) which consist, in this case and for example, of automobiles (3), walls, trees, posts, sidewalk curbs and fire hydrants.<br>
Other examples of mobile vehicles (1) are robots and motorized trucks which serve on production sites for the packaging and storage of products and which have to be located very accurately by performing a slot maneuver with respect to immediate surroundings {3) so as to locate the products suitably at the desired spot. In this case and for example, the immediate surroundings are made up of production machines, cabinets and storage shelves, walls and other mobile vehicles of the same type.<br>
The maneuver of slot parking of the vehicle (1) with respect to its surroundings (3) is split up into four phases which are positioning, locking, reverse-locking and realignment, such as represented in Figures 2, 3,<br>
4, 5 and 6.<br>
During the first positioning phase, the vehicle (1) must firstly be located suitably with respect to the front obstacle (4) . To do this, the vehicle must be located both laterally and longitudinally with respect<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 9 -<br>
to the obstacle, for example another vehicle. For the lateral positioning, such as depicted in Figure 2, the vehicle must be a satisfactory distance (20) from the front obstacle (24) while being as parallel as possible to the edge (5) of the parking zone. And for the longitudinal positioning, such as depicted in Figure 3, the vehicle must be located a satisfactory distance (21) in front of the charted parking zone.<br>
For the second locking phase, such as depicted in Figure 4, the back of the vehicle (1) enters the parking zone (2) and approaches the edge (5) of the parking zone for example the curb of a sidewalk or the surface of a wall- During this locking phase, the vehicle moves backward and locks the wheels so as to enter the parking zone and approach the edge of the parking zone, and is therefore oriented along an axis (6) different from that of the edge (5) of the parking zone.<br>
The third reverse-locking phase, which is depicted in Figure 5, comes about when the locking phase is sufficiently advanced and when the back (7) of the vehicle (i) reaches a satisfactory distance (24) with respect to the edge (5) of the parking zone. The vehicle must then reverse-lock the wheels while continuing to move backward so that the front part (8) of the vehicle also enters the parking zone (2).<br>
The fourth realignment phase, depicted in Figure 6, consists in resetting the vehicle (1) properly parallel to the edge (5) of the parking zone, together with the wheels of the vehicle, once the third reverse-locking phase is concluded, that is to say when the vehicle (1) has entered the parking zone completely.<br>
The management of the slot parking comes "about once the driver engages the method, this corresponding to the start  (9)  of the operating algorithm of the system<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 10 -<br>
depicted in Figure 1. The first phase consists firstly in evaluating whether the parking space available is large enough compared with the size of the vehicle.<br>
To do this, the space (10) available for parking the vehicle at the spot chosen by the operator must be evaluated. Once the available space has been evaluated<br>
(10)	, a check verifies that this space is sufficient<br>
(11)	for the vehicle and throughout the maneuver,  a<br>
safety test  (32) makes sure that this space remains<br>
sufficient.<br>
Numerous processes have already been developed for evaluating the distance which separates two obstacles between which the driver wishes to park his vehicle/ such as for example measuring the distance between the back of the vehicle (7) and the back obstacle (16) and the distance between the front of the vehicle (8) and the front obstacle (4) by means of sensors (36) of infrared, laser or ultrasound type, and as a function of the measured distances, validating or otherwise the possibility of parking the vehicle.<br>
Another example consists in comparing the distance which separates the two obstacles, front (4} and back (16) , with the size of the vehicle (1) . In this case, the distance is for example measured by means of a camera which analyzes the dark zones corresponding to the obstacles with respect to the light zone corresponding to the empty parking space.<br>
Next, when the space has been evaluated, either this available space is not large enough with respect to the size of the vehicle and in this case the parking of the vehicle is concluded (12) , or the parking space is sufficient and in this case confirmation (13) is requested from the operator to manage the slot parking and the confirmation response of the operator is tested (14). If the confirmation is "NO" then the slot parking<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 11 -<br>
is concluded (12) and if the response is "YES" then the slot parking (15) of the vehicle is carried out. Next,<br>
when the parking has terminated, the management of the slot parking is concluded (12).<br>
The vehicle is equipped with sensors (36) for measuring the distance between the mobile vehicle  (1)  and the surrounding obstacles (3) , with sensors for measuring orientation of the vehicle for determining the angle between the axis (6) of the vehicle and the axis (17) parallel to the edge (5) of the roadway, with sensors for measuring the. direction- of travel of the vehicle and with sensors for measuring speed. Together these sensors  (36) provide fixed quantitative measurements, for example a binary quantitative value such as forward or backward or else 0 or 1,  and others providing a variable   quantitative  value,   in  particular   the measurements of distance and of orientation.<br>
When the phase (10) of evaluating the available space is validated, that is to say it is possible to park the vehicle in a slot, and when the operator has confirmed (13) his desire to park the vehicle in a slot, the parking operation can then take place and consequently the following is undertaken in order to carry out the slot parking:<br>
-	the  input  data  originating  from  the  measurement<br>
sensors  which  provide  quantitative  values  are<br>
retrieved,<br>
-	some  of   these  quantitative   input  values   are<br>
translated and transformed into gradual qualitative<br>
input values, also referred to as fuzzy values, the<br>
other input data retaining their quantitative value,<br>
-	on the basis of qualitative rules, also referred to<br>
as fuzzy rules, operating instructions are processed<br>
and  determined  which  provide  gradual  qualitative<br>
output data and quantitative output data,<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/PR01/00917<br>
- 12 -<br>
-	these gradual qualitative output data are transformed<br>
into quantitative output data, the other quantitative<br>
output data retaining their value,<br>
-	the actuators of the vehicle are controlled as a<br>
function of the quantitative output data obtained.<br>
The parking operation is performed in real time, that is to say the input data are retrieved from the sensors at each instant and the actuators are also controlled at each instant during the entire progress of the slot parking maneuver. To do this, a measurement of the sensors is performed with a very low period, for example every 10 ms and the actuators of the vehicle are also controlled every 10 ms, after operating instructions have been determined.<br>
Thus, during the entire parking operation, the position and the movement of the vehicle with respect to the surrounding obstacles are evaluated at each instant, and the actuators of the vehicle are acted on, also at each instant, in real time, during the progress of the parking maneuver, said actuators controlling the speed, the direction of travel and the relative lock of the wheels of the vehicle, that is to say the position and the movement of the vehicle are controlled with respect to immediate obstacles so as to carry out the slot parking.<br>
In this way, the maneuver is performed such as an experienced operator would perform it manually without any assistance.<br>
The decisions determined by the parking management system are transmitted to the actuators of the vehicle (1) so that they directly control the speed, the direction of travel and the wheel lock of the vehicle, or to the operator via the output interface (41) so as to inform him as to the actions which he should perform<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 13 -<br>
on the accelerator pedal, brake pedal and clutch pedal, on the gearbox and on the steering wheel.<br>
The measurement data regarding the distances and orientation of the vehicle with respect to obstacles which are retrieved are in a preferential but nonlimiting mode those depicted in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, namely:<br>
-	the front right distance (ddav) which corresponds to<br>
the  distance  separating  the  right  front  of  the<br>
vehicle from the edge of the parking zone or from the<br>
obstacle at the border (5) of which one wishes to<br>
park. The value provided by this front right distance<br>
is a quantitative value which the operator can assess<br>
visually.<br>
-	the back right distance (ddar) which corresponds to<br>
the distance separating the right back of the vehicle<br>
from  the  edge  of  the parking  zone  or  from  the<br>
obstacle at the border of which one wishes to park.<br>
This back right distance is a value which can be<br>
assessed by the operator.<br>
-	the heading of the vehicle (heading) which represents<br>
the orientation of the vehicle with respect to the<br>
obstacle  alongside  which  one  wishes  to park  the<br>
vehicle. The value obtained is a quantitative value<br>
which the operator can assess during the progress of<br>
the parking maneuver.<br>
-	the distance with respect to the front vehicle (dav)<br>
which represents the space between the vehicle  (1)<br>
and the back of the obstacle parked in front of the<br>
parking zone.<br>
-	the longitudinal distance with respect to the front<br>
vehicle (dlav), measured along the parking axis.<br>
-	the relative longitudinal distance with respect to<br>
the longitudinal position instruction (dlavr)  which<br>
is equal to the longitudinal distance with respect to<br>
the  front  vehicle  minus  half  the  length  of  the<br>
longitudinal position instruction interval (21).<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
-	the  lateral  distance  with  respect  to  the  front<br>
vehicle   (dlatav)   which  is  a  lateral  distance<br>
perpendicular to the parking axis.<br>
-	the relative lateral distance with respect to the<br>
lateral position instruction {dlatavr) which.is equal<br>
to the lateral distance with respect to the front<br>
vehicle minus half the lateral position instruction<br>
interval (20).<br>
Measurement data regarding the direction of travel of the vehicle are also retrieved. The measurement of the direction ..of travel provides a fixed quantitative Value which is either forward, backward or idling.<br>
Test results which have a binary value which is either 0 (validated), or 1 (non validated) are also retrieved.<br>
Of all the values retrieved, the fixed quantitative and/or binary values are retained as they stand and the variable quantitative values are transformed into gradual qualitative values.<br>
These gradual qualitative values correspond to the assessment which an operator would have as regards his position, his orientation and his speed, such as for example move forward or backward very quickly, quickly, slowly or very slowly, or else position very far from, far from, close to or very close to an obstacle, likewise vehicle greatly or slightly at an angle with respect to the edge of the parking zone.<br>
Once these quantitative input data have been transformed into gradual qualitative input data and into fixed quantitative and/or binary data, operating instructions for acting the vehicle are then processed and determined, on the basis of nonlinear qualitative rules, these operating instructions corresponding to fixed quantitative and/or binary values and to gradual qualitative values which then have to be transformed<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 15 -<br>
next into quantitative values to control the actuators of the vehicle.<br>
The processing of the information is performed in real time, that is to say the data of the sensors are retrieved and operating instructions are processed and determined at each instant in time so as to analyze the entire progress of the maneuver with respect to its surroundings and act at the same time on the vehicle according to circumstances.<br>
Figure 7 depicts in .detail the operating algorithm for the operation of slot parking (15) of a vehicle (1) . When the available space has been validated and the operator has confirmed his wish to park the vehicle, the start (18) of the parking is then activated and instigates two operations simultaneously, the first operation consisting in carrying out the parking and the second in performing safety tests in parallel with the parking.<br>
The first operation, that is to say the carrying out of the parking, is split in a preferential but nonlimiting mode into four phases which are positioning, locking, reverse-locking and realignment, the switch from one phase to another occurring only if the position of the vehicle in each of the phases is deemed sufficient and validated by test.<br>
In the first positioning phase, a first test (19) is performed, which will then be referred to as "test 1", which makes it possible to evaluate the longitudinal position and' the transverse position of the vehicle during the positioning phase. This test 1 pertains to the following variables: lateral distance with respect to the front vehicle (dlatav), longitudinal distance with respect to the front vehicle (dlav) and the heading of the vehicle (heading) which must lie respectively in a lateral position instruction interval<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 16 -<br>
[oti,  a2]  (in meters)  (20) ,  a  longitudinal  position instruction interval  [$lt p2]  (in meters)  (21)  and an<br>
orientation instruction interval [o&gt;lf co2]  (in radians) .<br>
The first test 1  (19)  is validated when these three<br>
conditions above are fulfilled. Otherwise,  test 1 is<br>
not validated.<br>
If test 1 is not validated, then the positioning (22)<br>
is carried out and this operation is repeated until test 1 is validated, after which we go to the second locking phase.<br>
In the second locking phase, a second test (23) referred to in the subsequent text as "test 2" is performed which makes it possible to evaluate the position of the back of the vehicle (7) at the edge (5) of the parking zone, for example a sidewalk or a wall, during the locking phase. This test 2 (23) pertains to the back right distance variable (ddar) which must lie in a back position instruction interval iji, yz] (in meters) (24). This second test 2 is validated when this condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, test 2 is not validated.<br>
When test 2 is not validated,  locking  (25)  is then carried out and this operation is repeated until test 2<br>
is validated, after which we go to the third reverse-locking phase.<br>
For the third reverse-locking phase, a third test (26) is performed which will subsequently be referred to as "test 3" (26) which makes it possible to evaluate the orientation of the vehicle during the reverse-locking<br>
phase. This test 3 pertains to the vehicle heading variable (heading) which must lie in a vehicle orientation instruction interval [5i, 82] (in radians) . This test 3 is validated when the condition is fulfilled. When test 3 is not validated, reverse-locking (27) is carried out and this operation {27) is<br><br>
HO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
17<br>
repeated until test 3 is validated, after which we go to a fourth realignment phase.<br>
For the fourth realignment phase, a fourth test (28) is performed which will subsequently be referred to as "test 4",  which makes  it possible to evaluate  the distance to the other vehicles and the orientation of the vehicle during the realignment phase. This test 4 pertains  to  the  following variables:  distance  with respect  to  the  front  vehicle  (dav),  distance  with respect to the back vehicle (dar) and heading of the vehicle  .{heading}  which must  respectively . lie  i,n a position to the front vehicle instruction interval [K2, K2]  (in meters)  (43), be greater than a position to the back vehicle instruction value £ (in meters), and lie in an almost zero orientation instruction interval [r\T, T|2] {in radians) . This test 4 is validated if the three conditions above are true, that is to say lie in the defined intervals. As long as test 4 is not validated, realignment (29) is carried out and this operation is repeated until test 4 is validated, after which we go to,a fifth monitoring test (30) which will subsequently be referred to as "test 5".<br>
This test 5 makes it possible to evaluate the distance<br>
to the edge (5) of the parking zone (2) as well as the<br>
orientation of the vehicle once the realignment phase<br>
is concluded. This test 5 is an end of maneuver test<br>
and  it  is  validated when  the  vehicle  is  suitably<br>
parked. To do this, test 5 pertains to the front right<br>
.distance variable  (ddav)  and heading of the vehicle<br>
(heading)  which must respectively lie  in a lateral<br>
position of parking instruction interval  [Xlt  X2]  (in<br>
meters)  and  lie  in  a  zero orientation  instruction<br>
interval (4i, 42)  (in radians) and it is validated when<br>
these  two  conditions  are  fulfilled.  If  test  5  is<br>
validated, then the parking operation (15) is concluded<br>
(35) else the three phases of locking, reverse-locking<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 18 -<br>
and realignment are repeated until validation of test 5.<br>
The second operation which consists in carrying out safety tests in parallel while carrying out the parking makes it possible to guarantee the proper conduct of the maneuver and to avoid risking an accident with the surrounding obstacles.<br>
To do this, two safety tests are carried out simultaneously. The first safety test (31) subsequently referred to .as safety- test 1 makes it possible - to evaluate the actions of a possible operator on the control members of the vehicle (1), such as for example the clutch pedal, brake pedal and accelerator pedal, the steering wheel and the gearbox. As long as safety test 1 is validated, that is to say the operator does not manipulate any of the control members of the vehicle, this safety test 1 is repeated while continuing to carry out parking. Conversely, if safety test 1 is not validated, that is to say the operator has manipulated one of the control members of the vehicle, then the operator is requested, to validate (33) his desire to retake manual control of the vehicle and this validation of halting (34) is tested. If the validation of halting test (34) is validated, then the parking operation (15) is concluded (35).<br>
The second safety test {32), subsequently referred to as "safety test 2", makes it possible to evaluate the distance separating the vehicle from the obstacles delimiting the parking zone. This test is not validated<br>
if one of these distances is deemed dangerous for the subsequent operat ions, such as for example when there is an unforeseen and dangerous displacement of one of the obstacles or in the case of a failure of one of the sensors. In this case, the parking operation (IS) is concluded (35) . In the converse case in which safety<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/PR01/00917<br>

test 2 is validated, parking continues to be carried out normally.<br>
The carrying out of positioning (22) is performed by simultaneously administering the lateral position of the vehicle and the longitudinal position of the vehicle. To administer the lateral position of the vehicle, we proceed in the following manner:<br>
-	the lateral position of the vehicle is monitored by<br>
retrieving  four  input  data,   obtained  from  the<br>
measurements of the sensors, two input data taking a<br>
quantitative value,  namely the direction of travel<br>
and the result of test 1, and the other two input<br>
data taking a gradual qualitative value, namely the<br>
heading of  the vehicle  (heading)  and the relative<br>
lateral distance with respect to the lateral position<br>
instruction (dlatavr),<br>
-	the wheel lock operating instruction which takes a<br>
gradual qualitative value is processed and determined<br>
on the basis of qualitative rules and is translated<br>
and  transformed  subsequently  into  a  quantitative<br>
value,<br>
-	the wheel lock is acted upon as a function of the<br>
quantitative value obtained.<br>
Simultaneously, to administer the longitudinal position of the vehicle during the positioning operation, we proceed in the following manner:<br>
-	the longitudinal position of the vehicle is monitored<br>
by retrieving three input data,  obtained from the<br>
measurements of the sensors, two input data taking a<br>
quantitative value, namely the result of test 1 and<br>
the direction of travel,  and one input data item<br>
taking  a  gradual  qualitative  value  namely  the<br>
relative longitudinal distance (dlavr),<br>
-	operating instructions for acting on the speed and<br>
the  direction  of  travel   which  both  take   a<br>
quantitative value are then processed and determined<br>
on the basis of qualitative rules,<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 20 -<br>
-	the speed and the direction of travel are acted upon<br>
as  a  function  of  these  two  quantitative  values<br>
obtained.<br>
The carrying out of locking (25) is performed when the first positioning phase is concluded. To carry out this locking, we therefore proceed in the following manner:<br>
-	the lock is monitored by retrieving three input data,<br>
obtained from the measurements of the sensors,  an<br>
input data item taking a quantitative value, namely<br>
test 2,  and two data taking a gradual qualitative<br>
value, namely the heading of the vehiclev (heading)-<br>
and the back right distance with respect to the edge<br>
of the parking zone (ddar),<br>
-	operating instructions for acting on the speed and<br>
the direction of travel which take a quantitative<br>
value,  and on the wheel lock which takes a gradual<br>
qualitative value are then processed and determined<br>
and   are   translated   and   transformed   into   a<br>
quantitative value,<br>
-	the speed, the direction of travel and the wheel lock<br>
of the vehicle are acted upon as a function of the<br>
quantitative values obtained.<br>
The carrying out of reverse-locking (2 7) comes about in the third reverse-locking phase when the second locking phase  has  terminated.  To  carry  out  this  reverse-locking, we therefore proceed in the following manner: the  reverse-lock  is  monitored  by  retrieving  four input data,  obtained from the measurements of the sensors, two input data taking a quantitative value, namely the result of test 3 and the direction of travel,  and two data taking a gradual qualitative value namely the heading of the vehicle (heading) and the distance to the back vehicle (dar), operating instructions for acting on the speed and the direction of travel which take a quantitative value and on the wheel lock which takes a gradual qualitative value are processed and determined on the<br><br>

basis of qualitative rules and are translated and transformed into a quantitative value,<br>
-	she speed, the direction of travel and the wheel lock<br>
of the vehicle are acted upon as a function of the<br>
quantitative values obtained.<br>
The carrying out of realignment (29) comes about in the fourth  realignment  phase  when  the  third phase  has terminated.   The  carrying  out  of  realignment   is performed by simultaneously administering the lateral position and the longitudinal position of the vehicle. To administer the longitudinal position of the vehicle, we proceed in the following manner:<br>
-	the longitudinal position is monitored by retrieving<br>
four  input  data  obtained  from  measurements  of<br>
sensors, two input data taking a quantitative value<br>
namely the result of test 4  and the direction of<br>
travel of the vehicle and two input data taking a<br>
gradual qualitative value namely the distance to the<br>
back vehicle  (dar)  and the  distance  to  the  front<br>
vehicle (dav),<br>
-	operating instructions for acting on the speed and<br>
the  direction  of  travel   which  both  take   a<br>
quantitative value are then processed and determined,<br>
-	the speed and the direction of travel are acted upon<br>
as a function of these two quantitative output values<br>
obtained.<br>
Simultaneously, to administer the lateral position of the vehicle during the realignment operation, we proceed in the following manner:<br>
-	the lateral position of the vehicle is monitored by<br>
retrieving  three  input  data  obtained  from  the<br>
measurements of  sensors,  two input data taking a<br>
quantitative value namely the direction of travel and<br>
the result of test 4, and the other input data item<br>
taking a gradual qualitative value namely the heading<br>
of the vehicle,<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 22 -<br>
-	the operating instruction for the wheel lock which<br>
takes a gradual qualitative value is processed and<br>
determined on the basis of qualitative rules and is<br>
translated  and  transformed  subsequently  into  a<br>
quantitative value,<br>
-	the wheel lock of the vehicle is acted upon as a<br>
function of the quantitative output value obtained.<br>
For each of the phases, the operating instruction regarding the speed takes a quantitative value. In a preferential but nonlimiting mode, the operating instruction regarding the speed. .. can take three quantitative values, these values corresponding to the zero speed, to a low speed and to a medium speed, these speeds being expressed in meters per second.<br>
Likewise, the operating instruction for acting on the direction of travel takes a quantitative value. This value is either forward, backward or idling.<br>
As far as the operating instruction for acting on the wheel lock is concerned, this takes one or more gradual qualitative values which is/are translated subsequently into a single quantitative value corresponding to an angle of wheel lock.<br>
Figures 10a, 10b, 10c and lOd depict several graphs or<br>
charts which will make it possible to explain the manner in which positioning, locking, reverse-locking and realignment are carried out. For the figures depicted here, it is necessary to carry out the positioning and in particular to determine the operating instruction so as to carry out the lateral locating of the vehicle. However the process remains the same for the achieving of the longitudinal position in the positioning operation and for the carrying out of the operations of locking, reverse-locking and realignment, the input and output variables and the qualitative rules of determination being modified as a<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 23 -<br>
function of the criteria for choosing the operating instructions.<br>
For the vehicle positioning operation, the lateral position of the vehicle and the longitudinal position are monitored simultaneously. As far as the lateral position of the vehicle is concerned, four input data are retrieved, two of them are quantitative data which retain their value as it stands, namely the direction of travel which takes the value forward, backward or idling which is for example quantized by -1, 0 and 1 or negative, zero, positive, and test 1 which is validated or non validated or can be quantized for example by the values 0 or 1. The other two input data, namely the heading of the vehicle (heading) and the relative lateral distance (dlatavr), are the quantitative data which the operator can more or less assess and approximate and are therefore translated and transformed into gradual qualitative data which therefore need to be determined.<br>
To do this, Figure 10a depicts a partitioning graph for the heading of the vehicle input (heading) which makes it possible to switch from the quantitative value to one or more gradual qualitative values. The partitioning graph of Figure 10a which is a preferential but nonlimiting mode depicts along the abscissa a quantitative value of the heading of the vehicle whose unit is for example the radian, that is to say the measurement obtained directly from the sensors of the vehicle. Along the ordinate it depicts various gradual qualitative values which the heading of the vehicle (heading) can take. These values correspond to the assessment that one or more operators would have as regards the orientation of the vehicle.<br>
For example, a negative heading (CN) of the vehicle is<br>
defined by the gradual interval, also referred to as a fuzzy interval [-ai -ai -a2 -a3]  (in radians). When the<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FRO1/00917<br>
- 24 -<br>
quantitative value of the heading lies in the interval [-a! -a2] (in radians) , the heading is regarded as negative with a degree of 1, when it lies in the interval [-a2 -a3] , the heading is regarded as negative with a diminishing degree vanishing beyond -a3.<br>
Likewise, a zero heading (CZ) is defined by the gradual interval [-a2 -a4 a4 a2] (in radians), the heading being regarded as zero with a rising degree over the interval [-a2 -a4] with a degree of 1 over the interval [-a4 a4] and with a diminishing degree over the interval [a4 a2] .<br>
Likewise the positive heading (CP) is defined by the gradual interface [a3 a2 SLI aj (in radians) . When the quantitative value of the heading lies in the interval [^2 ai] , the heading is regarded as positive with a degree of 1. When it lies in the interval [a3 a2] , the heading is regarded as positive with a rising degree taking the value 1 at a2,<br>
For example, for a vehicle heading value equal to x depicted in Figure 10a, the heading therefore takes the gradual qualitative value yi zero heading* and y2 positive heading, yx and y2 being degrees lying between 0 and 1 that correspond to the assessment that a driver would have of the orientation of his vehicle, that is to say + or - straight heading or + or - heading inclined in a direction.<br>
The partitioning graph for the relative lateral distance input (dlatavr) in Figure 10b depicts along the abscissa the quantitative value (in meters) provided by the measurements from the sensors and along the ordinate the gradual qualitative value or values taken by the input data item (dlatavr).<br>
Thus, the relative lateral distance (dlatavr) is defined qualitatively as a negative lateral distance (DN)  by the gradual  interval  [-bi  -bi  -b2  -b3]  (in<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 25 -<br>
meters) . When the quantitative value of the relative lateral distance lies in the interval [-b1 -b2] , the latter is regarded as negative with a degree of 1. When the quantitative value lies in the interval Ob2 -b3] , the relative lateral distance is regarded as negative with a diminishing degree vanishing beyond -b3.<br>
Likewise, a zero relative lateral distance (DZ) is defined by the gradual interval [-b2 -b3 b3 b2] (in metres) , the relative lateral distance (dlatavr) being regarded as zero with a rising degree over the interval f-b2 -b3] , with a degree of 1 over the interval [-b3 b3] and with a diminishing degree over the interval [b3 b2] -<br>
Likewise a positive relative lateral distance (DP) is defined by the gradual interval [b3 b2 bx b2] (in meters) . When the quantitative value of the relative lateral distance (dlatavr) lies in the interval [b2 bi] , the latter is regarded as positive with a degree of 1. When the value lies in the interval [b3 b2] , the relative lateral distance is regarded as positive with a rising degree taking the value 1 at b2.<br>
For example, for a quantitative value of the relative lateral distance (dlatavr) equal to x1 (in meters), two gradual qualitative values of the relative lateral distance (dlatavr) are obtained, equal to y' x zero lateral distance and y' 2 positive lateral distance where y' x and y' 2 are degrees lying between 0 and 1.<br>
These values correspond to the assessment that an operator would have of the relative lateral distance (dlatavr), namely the right edge (44) of the vehicle lies + or - at the median of the lateral position instruction (20) and the right edge (44) lies + or -above the median of the lateral position instruction (20) .<br><br>

Once the gradual qualitative input values have been determined, output instructions which, in the case of lateral positioning, is the relative lock of the wheels of the vehicle which also takes one or more gradual qualitative output values, are processed and determined.<br>
These gradual qualitative output values of the relative lock angle are defined in the following manner:<br>
-	a medium negative lock angle  (BMN) by the gradual<br>
interval  t-Ci -Ci -c2 -c3] ,  the angle of lock being<br>
regarded as -medium negative with a degree of 1 when<br>
its quantitative value lies in the interval [-Ci -c2]<br>
and as medium negative with a diminishing degree over<br>
the interval [-c2 -c3] ,<br>
-	a  small  negative  lock angle  <bfn by the gradual></bfn>
interval [-c2 -c3 0] , the angle of lock being regarded<br>
as  small  negative  with  a  rising  degree  when  its<br>
quantitative value lies in the interval [-c2 -c3] and<br>
as small negative with a diminishing degree over the<br>
interval [-c3 0] ,<br>
-	a zero lock angle (BZ) by the gradual interval [-c3 0<br>
c3] , the angle of lock being regarded as zero with a<br>
rising degree when its quantitative value lies in the<br>
interval  [-c3  0]  and  as  zero  with  a  diminishing<br>
degree over the interval [0 c3] ,<br>
-	a small positive lock angle  (BFP)  by the gradual<br>
interval [0 c3 c2] , the angle of lock being regarded<br>
as  small positive with a  rising degree when  its<br>
quantitative value lies in the interval [0 c3] and as<br>
small positive with a diminishing degree over the<br>
interval [c3 c2] ,<br>
-	a medium positive  lock angle  (BMP)  by the gradual<br>
interval  [c3  c2  Ci  cj ,  the  angle  of  lock being<br>
regarded as medium positive with a degree of 1 when<br>
its quantitative value lies in the interval  [c2 cx]<br>
and as medium positive with a rising degree over the<br>
interval [c3 c2] .<br><br>

The quantitative values clt c2 and c3 are dimensionless and correspond to values relating to the maximum lock angle of the vehicle. Consequently these values lie in the interval [-1 1] a value of -1, respectively 1, corresponds to the maximum locking of the wheels to the left, respectively to the right.<br>
To process and determine these qualitative values regarding the relative lock of the wheels which makes it possible to carry out the lateral positioning in the positioning operation, charts depicted in Figure lOd, which are referred -to as the* "hyper rectangle- of ,-determination of the lateral position monitor", are used.<br>
In the case of lateral positioning, this hyper rectangle of determination of the lateral position monitor is a chart of qualitative rules which, on the basis of the four inputs, two quantitative inputs (the result of test 1 and direction of travel) and two gradual qualitative inputs (heading and dlatavr), determines an output value of the relative lock of the wheels which here is a gradual qualitative value.<br>
For example, for the value x of the heading of the vehicle (heading), measured by the sensors, the graph of Figure 10a yields two gradual qualitative values yi zero heading and y2 positive heading with yi and y2 lying between 0 and 1. The quantitative value x' of the relative lateral distance (dlatavr), the graph of Figure 10b yields two gradual qualitative values y' x zero distance and y' 2 positive distance with y'x and y'2 lying between 0 and 1.<br>
Next, if test 1 is not validated and the direction of travel is forward, then the hyper rectangle of determination of the lateral position monitor of Figure lOd is employed and makes it possible to obtain one or<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FR01/00917<br>

more gradual qualitative values of the relative angle of lock output.<br>
For a zero heading' (CZ) and a zero distance (DZ) , a zero lock (BZ) is then obtained and is weighted by a coefficient.1 dependent on the values of yi and y'i-<br>
For a positive heading <cp and a zero distance medium negative lock is obtained weighted by coefficient dependent on the values of y2 y i.></cp>
For a zero heading (CZ) and a positive distance (DP), a small negative lock (BFN) is obtained and is weighted by a coefficient dependent on the values of yL and y'2-<br>
For a positive heading (CP) and a positive distance (DP) , a medium negative lock (BMN) is obtained and is weighted by a coefficient dependent on the values of y2 and y'2 -<br>
Hence/ four1 qualitative values are obtained for the relative lock of the wheels, namely Z^ zero lock, Z2 medium negative lock, Z3 small negative lock, S4 medium negative lock, where Z2, Z2, Z3 and Z4 are four values lying between 0 and 1 which depend on two coefficients out of y1# y'i, y2 and y'2-<br>
On the basis of these four gradual qualitative values obtained for the relative lock of the wheels, one then deduces therefrom one single quantitative output value for the angle of relative lock of the wheels. This quantitative, output value of the relative lock of the wheels is then calculated by mathematical procedures such as for example by the barycentric procedure.<br>
Likewise, if the test is non validated and the direction of travel is backward, then four gradual qualitative values are obtained for the values x of the heading  and  x1  of  the  relative  lateral  distance<br><br>

a medium positive  lock qualitative value  (BMP)  is<br>
obtained and is weighted by a coefficient dependent<br>

is  obtained  and  is  weighted  by  a  coefficient<br>

From these four gradual qualitative values of relative lock of the wheels, namely Z' j. medium positive lock, Z' 2 zero lock, Z '3 small positive lock and Z'4 medium positive lock where Z1! Z'2 Z'3 Z'4 are four values lying between 0 and 1 which depend on two coefficients out of yx, y'i, Y2 o Y' 2 / we then deduce therefrom a quantitative value of the angle of lock of the wheels which is determined from a mathematical projection calculation for example of the barycentric calculation type.<br>
In the case where test 1 is validated or where the direction of travel is idling, then the lock instruction is zero lock (BZ) . From this is deduced a quantitative value of the angle of lock of the wheels by a projection calculation for example of barycentric calculation type.<br><br>

To process and determine output operating instructions for the longitudinal positioning of the positioning operation, for the locking operation, the reverse-locking operation and the realignment operation, hyper rectangles of determination are also defined.<br>
For the longitudinal positioning, this is a hyper rectangle of determination of the longitudinal monitor which has three inputs, namely the result of test 1, the direction of travel and the relative longitudinal distance (dlavr) and two outputs namely the speed and the. direction of- travel.<br>
For the locking operation, this is a hyper rectangle of determination of the locking monitor which has three inputs, namely the result of test 2f the heading of the vehicle and the back right distance (ddar) , and three outputs namely the relative lock of the wheels, the speed and the direction of travel.<br>
For the reverse-locking operation, this is a hyper rectangle of determination of the reverse-locking monitor which has four inputs, namely the result of test 3, the direction of travel, the heading of the vehicle and the distance with respect to the back vehicle (dar), and three outputs namely the relative lock of the wheels, the direction of travel and the speed.<br>
For the realignment operation, this is a hyper rectangle of determination of the realignment monitor which has four inputs, namely the result of test 4, the<br>
direction of travel, the distance with respect to the back vehicle (dar) and the distance with respect to the front vehicle Cdav), and three outputs, viz the speed, the direction of travel and the relative lock of the wheels.<br><br>

Figures 8 and 9 make it possible to explain the device<br>
(39) for implementing the method for managing slot parking. This device (3 9) is installed directly on the vehicle (1).<br>
To retrieve the measurements of the input datar  the sensors (36) are installed on the vehicle.<br>
To obtain the various distance measurements which were defined earlier, the vehicle (1) is equipped with sensors for example of infrared, ultrasound or laser ¦ telemetry type.", Likewise, the vehicle is equipped with', sensors of gyrometer type which make it possible to measure the orientation of the vehicle, that is to say the heading of the vehicle. To retrieve the direction of travel and the speed of the vehicle, the latter is equipped for example with tachometer sensors or with wheel speed sensors of the type of those used by ABS systems.<br>
The distance sensors (36) of the infrared, ultrasound or laser type are for example installed on the vehicle, such as depicted in Figure 8, that is to say at the front (8) , left and right, at the back (7) , left and right, and on the front lateral side (37) and back lateral side (38).<br>
These sensors are installed in a preferential but nonlimiting mode midway up the height of the vehicle so as to detect all obstacles such as other vehicles, sidewalk curbs and walls, and they must also have in a preferential but nonlimiting mode a cone of detection making it possible to sense in three dimensions.<br>
The input data obtained by means of the measurement sensors are then transmitted to an on-board computer (42) on the vehicle (1). To do this, the device has an input interface (40) which retrieves the signals of the sensors, processes them and then transmits to the on-<br><br>

The on-board computer (42) comprises a computer program which transforms some of the quantitative input data into gradual qualitative input data, in particular the measurements of distances and orientation. The on-board computer also performs the various tests namely test 1, test 2, test 3, test 4, test 5 and the safety tests 1 and 2. It also administers the computer programs making it  possible  to  process  and  determine  operating instructions  for  each of  the positioning.,  locking, reverse-locking and realignment operations. To do this, the computer program comprises the various qualitative rules of each of the hyper rectangles of determination which make it possible to process and determine the output operating instructions.<br>
Once the computer has determined the output operating instructions, the latter are processed by an output interface (41) which transforms the output information from the computer into control signals bound for the actuators of the vehicle controlling the speed, the direction of travel and the relative lock of the wheels. To do this, the computer transforms the gradual qualitative output instruction for the relative lock of the wheels into a quantitative value.<br>
To control the speed, the device uses in a preferential but nonlimiting mode an actuator which controls the angle of opening of the throttle valves which adjust the flow rate of gas mixture into the cylinders in the case of a combustion engine and an actuator which controls the braking system. In the case of an electric motor, the amplitude of the motor supply voltage will, for example, be controlled.<br>
To control the direction of travel of the vehicle, the device has in a preferential but nonlimiting mode a<br><br>
WO 01/74643	PCT/FROl/0091?<br>
- 33 -<br>
gearbox of automatic gearbox or robotized gearbox type which makes it possible to actuate the forward direction of travel or the backward direction of travel depending on the forward reverse ratio chosen by the operator. In the case where the motor is of electric type, the device can then act directly on the sign of the signal of the electric current which controls the direction of rotation of said motor depending on the direction of travel chosen by the operator.<br>
As far as the control of the angle of relative lock of the wheels is concerned, the device sets -in a preferential but nonlimiting mode directly on the torque motor which controls the steering column of the vehicle and hence the angle of lock of the wheels, or on the motor or motors which control the locking of the wheels in the case of columnless electric steering.<br>
In another embodiment, the device uses a visual and/or audible and/or kinesthetic interface which informs the operator directly as to the maneuvers to be performed to park the vehicle. In this case, the actuators are directly the hands and the feet of. the operator which act on the steering wheel, the gearbox, the accelerator pedal, brake pedal and clutch pedal.<br>
The visual and/or audible and/or kinesthetic interface then informs the operator while the maneuver is progressing as to the actions which he should perform<br>
on the steering wheel, the gearbox, the accelerator pedal, brake pedal and clutch pedal to be able to park<br>
the vehicle in a slot. For example, the visual interface may be equipped with a screen, with a voicebox or with means of vibration of the steering wheel which indicates to the operator that he should begin and/or terminate the parking maneuver. This visual and/or audible and/or kinesthetic interface can be installed on the vehicle for the safety of the operator who prefers to be informed by the on-board<br><br>
WO 01/74643		PCT/FR01/00917<br>
- 34 - <br>
computer and to act on the vehicle by himself so as to park it in a slot rather than allow it to be guided<br>
automatically.<br>
In the case where the operator is informed visually and/or aurally and/or kinesthetically of the controls to be performed on the vehicle, said vehicle is then, in a preferential but nonlimiting mode, equipped with means for limiting the actions of the driver which make it possible to avoid improper maneuvers when he acts on the control members such as the steering wheelt the gearbox, the accelerator pedal, brake pedal -and clutch pedal. Thus the operator has control of the vehicle to the extent that he does not make any maneuvering error, in the converse case the means of limitation will inform him of his improper maneuvers while limiting for example the rotation of the steering wheel or the wheel lock or else the speed of the vehicle.<br><br>
