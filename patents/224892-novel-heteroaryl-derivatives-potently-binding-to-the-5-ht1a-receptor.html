				<td>Novel neteroaryl derivatives, their preparation and use<br>
The present invention relates to novel heteroaryl derivatives potently binding to the 5-HTu receptor, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and the use thereof for the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurological disorders. Many of the compounds, of the invention have also potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and are thus considered particularly useful for the treatment of depression.<br>
Furthermore, many compounds of the invention have also effect at dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and are considered to be useful for the treatment of psychosis.<br>
Background Art<br>
Clinical and pharmacological studies have shown that 5-HTIA agonists and partial agonists are useful in the treatment of a range of affective disorders such as generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and aggression.<br>
It has also been reported that 5-HTIA ligands may be useful in the treatment of ischaemia.<br>
An overview of 5-HTIA antagonists and proposed potential therapeutic targets for these antagonists based upon preclinical and clinical data are presented by Schechter et al, Serotonin 1997, Vol.2, Issue 7. It is stated that 5-HTiA antagonists may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, senile dementia, dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, and in combination with SSRI antidepressants also to be useftd in the treatment of depression.<br>
5-HT reuptake inhibitors are well-known antidepressant drugs and useful for the treatment of panic disorders and social phobia.<br>
The effect of combined administration of a compound that inhibits serotonin reuptake and a 5-HTIA receptor antagonist has been evaluated in several studies (Innis, R.B. et al. Eicr. X Pharmacol 1987,143, p 195-204 and Gartside, S.E., Br J. PJiarmacol 1995,115, p 1064-1070, Blier, P. et al. Trends Pharmacol ScL 1994,15,220). In these studies it was found<br><br>
that combined 5-HT1A receptor antagonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors would produce a more rapid onset of therapeutic action.<br>
Dopamine D4 receptors belong to the family of dopamine D2-like receptors which is considered to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics. Dopamine D4 receptors are primarily located in areas of the brain other than striatum, suggesting that dopamine D4 receptor ligands have antipsychotic effect and are devoid of extrapyramidal activity.<br>
Accordingly, dopamine D4 receptor ligands are potential drugs for the treatment of psychosis and positive symptoms of schizophrenia and compounds with combined effects at dopamine D4, and serotonergic receptors may have the further benefit of improved effect on negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anxiety and depression, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders, aggression, side effects induced by conventional antipsychotic agents, ischaemic disease states, migraine, senile dementia and cardiovascular disorders and in the improvement of sleep.<br>
Dopamine D3 receptors also belong to the family of dopamine D2 like receptors. D3 antagonistic properties of an antipsychotic drug could reduce the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits and result in an improved side effect profile with respect to EPS and hormonal changes.<br>
Accordingly, agents acting on the 5-HTiA receptor, both agonists and antagonists, are believed to be of potential use in the therapy of psychiatric and neurological disorders and thus being highly desired. Furthermore, antagonists at the same time having potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and/or D4 and/or D3 activity may be particularly useful for the treatment of various psychiatric and neurological diseases.<br>
Bart J van Steen et al. J. Med Chem. 1994,37(17), 2761-73 describes certain related benzofuran and benzodioxan derivatives having affinity for the 5-HTu receptor and therefore being useful in the treatment of depression and anxiety.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that compounds of a certain class of heteroaryl derivatives bind to the 5-HTIA receptor with high affinities. Additionally, the compounds also show serotonin reuptake inhibition activity. Furthermore, it has been found that many of the compounds have effect at dopamine D3 and/or D4 receptors.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric derivatives.<br>
Additional methods for the resolution of optical isomers, known to those skilled in the art, may be used. Such methods include those discussed by J. Jaques, A. Collet and S. Wilen in Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981).<br>
Optically active compounds can also be prepared from optically active starting materials.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared by one of the following methods comprising:<br>
a)        treating a compound of formula (H) with a compound of formula (HI) in the presence of a reducing agent.<br><br><br>
wherein n, m, R1 - R3, R10, R», R12. R&gt;5, Q, W, X, Y, Z, A and the dotted line are as defined above;<br>
b)       treating a compound of formula (TV) with a compound of formula (V) in the presence of an appropriate base<br><br>
wherein L is a suitable leaving group such as e.g. chloro and n, m, R1 - R3, R10, R11, R12 -R15, Q, W, X, Y, Z, A and the dotted line are as defined above;<br>
Whereupon the compounds of formula (I) are isolated as the free base or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
The reductive amination according to method a) is preferably earned out in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a reducing agent, eg triacetoxyborohydride, at room temperature.<br>
The arylation according to method b) is conveniently performed in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of a base (eg potassium tert-butoxide) at a temperature in the range of 40-100 °C, preferably in the range of 40-80 °C, and most preffered around 50 °C.<br>
Arylpiperazine derivatives of formula (II) are either commercially available or conveniently prepared from the corresponding arylamine according to the method described by Martin et aL J. Med. Chem. 1989,32,1052, or the method described by Kruse et al Rec. Tray. Chim. Pays-Bos 1988,107&gt; 303. The starting arylamines are either commercially available or are well-described in the literature.<br>
Aryltetrahydropyridine derivatives of formula (H) are known from literature, cf. US Pat. No. 2,891,066; McElvain et al. 1 Amer. Chem. Soc. 1959, 72,3134. Conveniently, the corresponding arylbromide is lithiated with BuLi followed by addition of l-benzyl-4-piperidone. Subsequent treatment with acid gives the N-benzyl-aryltetrahydropyridine. The benzyl group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with e.g. ethyl chloroformate to give the corresponding ethyl carbamate followed by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis. The starting arylbromides are either commercially available or well-described in the literature.<br>
Aldehydes of formula (HT) are prepared as described in the Examples below. The starting chloropyridines are commercially available or made by methods well-described in the literature<br>
The following examples will illustrate the invention forfhen They are, however, not to be construed as limiting.<br><br>

lE NMR spectra were recorded at 500.13 MHz on a Bruker Avance DRX500 instrument or at 250.13 MHz on a Bruker AC 250 instrument. Deuterated chloroform (99.8%D) or dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9%D) were used as solvents. TMS was used as internal reference standard. Chemical shift values are expressed in ppm-values. The following abbreviations are used for multiplicity of NMR signals: s=singlet, d=doublet, t^triplet, q=quartet, qui=quintet, h=heptet, dd=double doublet, dt=double triplet, dq=double quartet, tt=triplet of triplets, m=multiplet, b=broad singlet NMR signals corresponding to acidic protons are generally omitted Content of water in crystalline compounds was determined by Karl Fischer titration. Standard workup procedures refer to extraction with the indicated organic solvent from proper aqueous solutions, drying of combined organic extracts (anhydrous MgS04 or Na2S04), filtering and evaporation of the solvent in vacuo. For column chromatography silica gel of type Kieselgel 60, 230-400 mesh ASTM was used. For ion-exchange chromatography (SCX, 1 g, Varian Mega Bond Elut®, Chrompack cat. no. 220776). Prior use the SCX-columns were pre-conditioned with 10% solution of acetic acid in methanol (3 mL).<br><br>

The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through Unifilter GF/B filters on a Tomtec Cell Harvester. Filters were counted in a Packard Top Counter.   Compounds la, lb, 2a, 2c, 21,2o, 2s, 2u, 2z, 2aa, 2ah, 2ai and 2aj were tested and showed IC5o values of less than 300 nM.<br>
The compounds of the invention have also been tested for their effect on re-uptake of serotonin in the following test:<br>
Inhibition of ^-S-HT Uptake Into Rat Brain Synaptosomes.<br>
Using this method, the ability of drugs to inhibit the accumulation of 3H-5-HT into whole rat brain synaptosomes is determined in vitro. The assay was performed as described by Hyttel, J. Psychopharmacology 1978, 60, 13. Compounds la, lr, 2a, 2c, 21,2o, 2s, 2u, 2z, 2aa, 2ah, 2ai and 2aj were tested and showed IC50 values of less than 20 nM.<br>
The 5-HTIA antagonistic activity of some of the compounds of the invention has been estimated in vitro at cloned 5-HTIA receptors stably expressed in transfected HeLa cells (HA7). In this test, 5-HTu antagonistic activity is estimated by measuring the ability of the compounds to antagonize the 5-HT induced inhibition of forskolin induced cAMP accumulation. The assay was performed as a modification of the method described by Pauwels, PJ. et al. Biochenu Pharmacol 1993,45, 375. Compounds la, lb, le and Iv were tested and showed IC50 values of less than 7000 nM.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention have also been tested for their in vivo effect on 5-HTiA receptors in the assay described by Sanchez. C. et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1996,315, pp 245. In this test, antagonistic effects of test compounds are determined by measuring the ability of the test compounds to inhibit 5-MeO-DMT induced 5-HT syndrome.<br>
The compounds of the present invention possess valuable activity as serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and have antagonistic effect at 5-HTIA receptors. The compounds of the invention are therefore considered useful for the treatment of diseases and disorders responsive to the inhibition of serotonin re-uptake and antagonistic activity at 5-HTIA receptors. Diseases<br><br>
responsive to the inhibition of serotonin re-uptake are well-known in the art and include affective disorders, such as depression, psychosis, anxiety disorders including general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc.<br>
As explained above, the antagonistic activity at 5-HT]A receptors of the compounds of .the invention will counteract the negative feed back mechanism induced by the inhibition of serotonin reuptake and is thereby expected to improve the effect of the serotonin reuptake inhibiting activity of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds as claimed herein are therefore considered to be particularly useful as fast onset of action medicaments for the treatment of depression. The compounds may also be useful for the treatment of depressions which are non-responsive to currently available SSRIs.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention have also been found to have affinity to dopamine D3 and D4 receptors in the following two assays.<br>
Inhibition of the binding of 3H-YM-09151-2 to human dopamine D4 receptors<br>
By this method, the inhibition by drugs of the binding of [3H]YM-09151-2 (0.06 nM) to membranes of human cloned dopamine D^-receptors expressed in CHO-cells is determined in vitro. Method modified from NEN Life Science Products, Inc., technical data certificate PC2533-10/96.<br>
Inhibition of the binding of [^-Spiperone to human D3 receptors<br>
By this method, the inhibition by drugs of the binding [^Spiperone (0.3 nM) to membranes of human cloned dopamine D3-receptors expressed in CHO-cells is determined in vitro. Method modified from R.G. MacKenzie et al. Eur. J. Pharm.-Mol Pharm. Sec. 1994,266,79-85.<br><br>
As seen from the above, the compounds of the invention show affinity for the 5-HT1A receptors, inhibitory activity at serotonin reuptake sites, and affinity for dopamine D3 and D4 receptors. Accordingly, the compounds are considered useful for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders as mentioned previously.<br>
