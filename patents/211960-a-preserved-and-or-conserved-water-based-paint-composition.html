ENZYMATIC PRESERVATION OF WATER BASED PAINTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to enzymatically preserved and/or<br>
conserved water based paint or fluid compositions used in the production of fossil oil and gas, methods for producing such compositions and the use antimicrobial enzymes in for preservation of water based paints and drilling fluids.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Oxidoreductases such as peroxidases and laccases have been suggested as antimicrobial agents in the cleaning industry. The antimicrobial activity of oxidoreductases within fields such as<br>
detergents or biofilm removal is described in disclosures such as in WO 97/04102 (NOVO NORDISK), WO 97/42825 (NOVO NORDISK), WO 97/28257 (NOVO NORDISK) , WO 97/41215 (NOVO NORDISK) and WO 98/26807) (NOVO NORDISK).<br>
Other prior arc is WO 95/27009 (STRICHTING SCKEIKUNDIG<br>
ONDERSOZOEK   IN   NEDERLAND)   which   suggests   that   the<br>
antimicrobial activities of vanadium chloroperoxidases may be<br>
used  to  prevent  fouling  of  a  marine  paint  surface  by<br>
immobilising the haloperoxidase in the paint surface and use<br>
ha1ides and hydrogen peroxide present in sea water to provide<br>
antimicrobial reactions. Examples cf this use include vanadium<br>
chlorohaloperoxidase mixed with a solvent based chlorinated<br>
rubber antifouling 2 000  (AKZO) product or immobilized in a<br>
acrylic  latex  (Sikkens)  or  a  polyacrylamid  matrix.  The<br>
activity cf  a  haloperoxidase  in  the  conventional  growth<br>
 inhibiting agent  (the  chlorinated  rubber  antifouling  2 00 0<br>
(AKZO) )  is  however  verv  low due  to  the  solvent  of  the<br><br>
antifouling agent and poor mixability of the fouling agent with the haloperoxidase.<br>
Also WO 95/27045 (UNILEVER) concerns the use of vanadium haloperoxidase in antimicrobial compositions.<br>
Patent application No. DK98/0 04 77 (unpublished at the date of priority) describes, in particular the section titled "Conservation/preservation of paints" on pages 41-42, the concept and advantages of using oxidoreductases for preservation and/or conservation of water based paints as an alternative to conventional environmentally bio-hazardous biocides, and this invention is a further development of the inventions described in this disclosure.<br>
EP 500 3 87 A2 discloses haloperoxidases which is used in antiseptic pharmaceutical products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As described in Danish patent application No. DK98/00477 (unpublished at the date of priority) conventional water based<br>
paints are conventionally preserved by adding non-enzymatic organic biocides such as isothiazoliones to the paint. The trend within paints has been to substitute conventional solvent based paints with water based paints to prevent serious health damage of the users. However water based paints need to be preserved to prevent microbial growth enabled by the increased water activity in the paint, and conventionally huge amounts of conventional biocides are used for this purpose, which has created a desire to find more environment<br>
friendly alternatives to the conventional biocides.<br>
We have found that the concept of using oxidoreductases<br>
for preservation and/or conservation and/or antifouling of<br><br>
water based paints works in a number of specific paint formulations. Accordingly the invention provides an advantageous alternative for preservation of water based paint by enabling substitution of conventional chemical biocides with enz&gt;mr.atic preservation systems. Thus the invention provides in a first aspect<br>
- a disinfected and/or preserved and/or conserved water based paint composition comprising an oxidoreductase, an oxidizing agent, at least 10% water and a binder.<br>
We have also found that oxidoreductases advantageously may be used for preservation and/or conservation of fluids used in the oil/gas industry for production of fossil oil/gas and the invention provides in a second aspect<br>
- a preserved and/or conserved water based fluid composition for use in the recovery of fossil oil and/or gas from drilling sites selected from the group consisting of drilling fluids, completion fluids, fracturing fluids, injection fluids, blocking gels and workover fluids said fluids comprising an oxidoreductase, an oxidizing agent and a biopolymer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
In the context of the invention the term "enhancer" is to be construed as a chemical compound, which upon interaction with an oxidoreductase and an oxidizing agent, becomes cxidized or otherwise activated and which in its oxidized or<br><br>
otherwise activated state provides a more powerful antimicrobial effect than could be obtained by the oxidoreductase and the oxidizing agent alone.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "water based paint" is to be construed as a composition usually comprising solid coloring matter dissolved or dispersed in a liquid vehicle comprising at least 10 % water, organic solvent and/or oils, which when spread over a surface, dries to leave a thin colored, decorative and/or protective coating. In the context of the invention this term is however also thought to encompass water based enamel, lacquer and/or polish compositions.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "oxidizing agent" is to be construed as a chemical or biological compound, which may act as an electron acceptor and/or oxidant. The oxidizing agent may mediated by an oxidoreductase catalyst oxidize an electron donor substrate, e.g. an enhancer (c . f . above) .<br>
In the context of the invention the term "preservation and/or conservation" is to be construed as preventing and/or inhibiting microbial growth such as fungal and/or bacterial growth in the medium, which is preserved and/or conserved.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "disinfection" is to be construed as killing microbial cells such as fungal = and/or bacterial cells in the medium, which is disinfected.<br>

In the context of the invention the term "viscosifier" is to be ccnstrued as a compound which when added to a liquid medium increases the viscosity of said liquid medium.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "pigment" is to be construed as a colored compound, which when added to a composition may provide the composition with a desired color.<br>
In the context cf the invention the term "dispersant" is to be construed as a compound, which when added to a heterogenous liquid of a solid-liquid mixture improves the distribution' of solid particles in the liquid, i.e. the dispersant helps keeping solid particles suspended in the liquid.<br>
In  the  context  of  the  invention  the  term  "foam<br>
•suppresser" is to be construed as a compound which when added<br>
to a liquid prevents and/or inhibits the formation of foam<br>
when  said  liquid  is  stirred,  shaked,  mixed,  aerated  or<br>
otherwise agitated thereby gases to enter the liquid.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "siccatives" is to be ccnstrued as water and/cr moisture absorbing compounds or drying agents.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "binder" is to be construed as the substance in the water based paint which, when the paint has been applied to a suitable surface and dried up, constitutes the continuous usually polymeric and adhesive m.atrix in which other paint constituents such as claments are distributed immobilized.<br>
Oxidoreductases<br>
The  cxidoreductase  in  the  context  of  the  present 3 invention  may  be  any  cxidoreductase  or  combination  of<br><br>
different oxidoreductases or combination of oxidoreductases with other enzymes, which facilitates the disinfection and/or preservation and/or conservation effect in a water based paint. Accordingly, when reference is made to "an oxidoreductase" this will in general be understood to include combinations of one or more oxidoreductases,<br>
It is to be understood that oxidoreductase variants (produced, for example, by recombinant techniques) are included within the meaning of the term "oxidoreductase".<br>
The enzyme classification employed in the present specification with claims is in accordance with Recommendations (1992) of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Academic Press, Inc., 1992.<br>
Accordingly the types of oxidoreductases which may appropriately be applied for preservation and/or conservation of a water based paint include oxidoreductases (EC 1.-.-.-),<br>
Preferred oxidoreductases in the context of the invention are any peroxidase belonging to the classification group EC 1.11.1.-, any laccase belonging to EC 1.10.3.2, any catechol oxidase belonging to EC 1.10.3.1, any bilirubin oxidase belonging to EC 1.3.3.5 or any monophenol monooxyge-nase belonging to EC 1.14.99.1 or any oxidases belonging to EC 1.1.3. - .<br>
Laccase and laccase related enzymes<br>
—     ■■ — ■      -*<br>
Preferred laccase enzymes and/or laccase related enzymes are enzymes of microbial origin. The enzymes may be derived from plants, bacteria or fungi (including filamentous fungi and yeasts).<br><br>
Suitable examples from fungi include a laccase derivable from a strain of Aspergillus, Neurospora, e.g., N. crassa, Podospora, Bo try ti s, Collybia, Fomes, Len tinus, 1^1 euro tus, Tramet.es, e.g., T. villosa and T. versioolor, Rhizoctonia, s .g. , R. solani, Coprinus, e.g. , C, oinereus, C, coma tus, C. friesii, and C. plicatilis, Psathyrella, e.g., P. condelleana, Panaeolus, e.g., P. papilionaceus, Myceliophthora, e.g., M. thermophila, Schytalidium, e.g. , S. Chermophilum, Polyporus, e.g. , P. pinsitus, Phlehia, e.g., P, radica (WO 92/01046) , or Coriolus, e.g'. , C. hirsutus (JP 2-238885) .<br>
Suitable  examples  from  bacteria  include  a  laccase derivable from a strain of Bacillus,<br>
A  laccase  derived  from Coprinus,       Myceliophthora, Polyporus,       Scytalidium     or Rhizoctonia      is  preferred;  in particular  a  laccase  derived  from  Coprinus       cinereus, Myceliophthora     thermophila,     Polyporus    pinsitus,      Scytalidium thermophilum  or Rhizoctonia  solani.<br>
The laccase or the laccase related enzyme may furthermore be one which is producible by a method comiprising cultivating a host cell transformed with a recombinant DNA vector which carries a DNA sequence encoding said laccase as well as, DNA sequences encoding functions permitting the expression of the DNA sequence encoding the laccase, in a culture medium under conditions permitting the expression of the laccase enzyme, and recovering the laccase from the culture.<br>
Determination of Laccase Activity (LACU)<br>
Laccase activity, preferable laccases derivable from a strain of Polvporus, may be determined from the oxidation of syringaldazin under aerobic  conditions.  The violet  colour<br><br>
produced is photometered at 53 0 nm. The analytical conditions are 19 mM syringaldazin, 23 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 30°C, 1 min. reaction time.<br>
1 laccase unit  (LACU)  is the amount of enzyme that<br>
catalyses the conversion of 1.0 fimole syringaldazin per minute at these conditions.<br>
Determination of Laccase Activity (LAMU)<br>
Laccase activity may be determined from the oxidation of syringaldazin under aerobic conditions. The violet colour produced is measured at 530 nm.. The analytical conditions are 19 mM syringaldazin, 23 mM Tris/maleate buffer, pH 7.5, 30°C, 1 min. reaction time.<br>
1 laccase unit (LAMU) is the amount of enzyme that catalyses the conversion of 1.0 |j.mole syringaldazin per minute at these conditions.<br>
The use of Laccases for preservation and/or conservation of paints benefits from the fact that laccases may utilize abundant molecular oxygen directly as oxidant.<br>

Other preferred fungi include strains belonging to the subdivision Basidiomycotina, class Basidiomycetes, e.g. , Coprinus, Phanerochaete, Coriolus or Trainetes, in particular Coprinus cinereus f. microsporus (IFO 8371), Coprinus macrorhizus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium (e.g. NA-12) or Trametes (previously called Polyporus) , e.g., T. versicolor (e.g. PR4 2S-A).<br>
Further preferred fungi include strains belonging to the subdivision Zygomycotina, class Mycoraceae, e.g., Rhizopus or Mucor,   in particular Mucor hiemalis,<br>
Some preferred bacteria include strains of the order Actinomycetales,     e.g. Streptomyces    spheroides     (ATTC 23965), Streptomyces thermoviolaceus   (IFO 12382) or Streptoverticillum verticillium  ssp. verticilliuin.<br>
Other preferred bacteria include Bacillus pumilus (ATCC 12905), Bacillus stearothermophilus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Eliodomonas       palustri,   Streptococcus   lactis,        Pseudomonas<br><br>
purrocinia    (ATCC 15 958) cr Pseudoxnonas    fluorescens    (NRRL B-<br>
11) .<br>
Further preferred bacteria include strains belonging to Myxococcus,   e.g. , M. virescens.<br>
The peroxidase may furthermore be one which is producible by a method comprising cultivating a host cell transformed with a recombinant DNA vector which carries a DNA sequence encoding said peroxidase as well as DNA sequences encoding functions permitting the expression of the DNA sequence encoding the peroxidase, in a culture medium under conditions permitting the expression of the peroxidase and recovering the peroxidase from the culture.<br>
Particularly, a recombinantly produced peroxidase is a peroxidase derived from a Coprinus sp. , in particular C. macrorhizus  or C. cinereus  according to WO 92/16634.<br>
Also haloperoxidases such as chrome-, bromo- and/or iodoperoxidases are suitable for preserving a paint according to the invention. Haloperoxidases form a class of enzymes which are able to oxidize halides (Cl- , Br- , I-) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or a hydrogen peroxide generating system to the corresponding hypohalous acids according to:<br>
K^O. + X- + K+ -&gt;   H.O + KOX,<br>
I   wherein X- is a halide and HOX is a hypohalous acid<br>
If a convenient nucleophilic acceptor is present, a reaction will occur with HOX and a halogenated compound will be formed.<br><br>
There are  three  types of haloperoxidases,  classified according   to   their   specificity   for   halide   ions: Chloropercxidases (E.G. 1.11.1.10) which catalyse formation of hypo-chloriz from chloride ions, hypo-bromit from bromide ions and  hypo-iodit  from  iodide  ions;  Bromoperoxidases  which catalyse formation of hypo-bromit from bromide ions and hypo-iodit from, iodide ions; and iodoperoxidases  (E.G.  1,11.1.8) which solely catalyze the formation of hypoiodit from iodide ions.     However,     hypoiodit     undergoes     spontanous disproporticnation to iodine and thus, iodine is usually the observed product of the reaction. These hypo-halit compounds may subsequently react with other compounds forming halogenated compounds.<br>
Haloperoxidases have been isolated from various organisms; mammals, marine animals, plants, algae, a lichen, fungi and bacteria (for reference see Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1161, 1993, pp. 249-256). It is generally accepted that haloperoxidases are the enzymes responsible for the formation of halogenated compounds in nature, although other enzymes may be involved.<br>
Haloperoxidases have been isolated from many different fungi, in particular from the fungus group dematiaceous hypho-mycetes, such as Caldariomyces, e.g., C. fumago, Alternaria, Curvularia, e.g., C. verruculosa and C. inaequalis, Drechslera, Ulocladium and Botrytis   (see US Patent No. 4,937,192).<br>
According  to  the  present  invention a  haloperoxidase<br>
obtainable from Curvalaria,     in particular C. verruculosa    is<br>
preferred such as C. verruculosa CBS 147 .63 or C. verruculosa<br>
CES   444.70.   Curvularia       haloperoxidase   and   recombinant<br>
production hereof is described in WO 97/04102.<br><br>
Haloperoxidases have also been isolated from bacteria such as Pseudomonas, e.g., P. pyrrocinia (for reference see The Journal of Biological Chemistry 263, 1988, pp. 13725-13732) and SCreptomyces, e.g., S. aureofaciens (for reference see Structural Biology 1, 1994, pp. 532-537).<br>
Bromide peroxidase has been isolated from algae (see US Patent No, 4,937,192).<br>
In a preferred embodiment the haloperoxidase is derivable from. Curvularia sp., in particular C. verruculosa and C. inaequalis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the haloperoxidase is a vanadium haloperoxidase derivable from a strain of Curvularia inaequalis such C. inaequalis CBS 102.42 as described in WO 95/27046, e.g. a vanadium haloperoxidase encoded by the DNA sequence  of  WO  95/27046,  figure  2  all  incorporated  by<br>
reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the haloperoxidase is a vanadium haloperoxidase derivable from a strain selected from<br>
Drechslera    hartlehii, Dendryphiella    salina,     Phaeotrichoconis<br>
   crotalarie  and Geniculosporium  sp.   The vanadium haloperoxidase<br>
is more preferably derivable from Drechslera   hartlebii     (DSM<br>
Ace. NO.'DSM 13444), Dendryphiella   salina    (DSM Ace. No. DSM<br>
13443), Phaeotrichoconis   crotalarie    (DSM Ace. No. DSM 13441)<br>
and Geniculosporium    sp,      (DSM Ace.  No.  DSM 13442)  such as<br>
described in the co-pending Danish patent applications PA.2000<br>
00628,  PA.  2000  00627,  PA2000  00625  and  PA2000  00626  all<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Determination of Peroxidase Activity (POXU<br><br>
One peroxidase unit (POXU) is the amount of enzyme which under the following conditions catalyze the conversion of 1 µmole hydrogen peroxide per minute:<br>
0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 0.8 8 mM hydrogen peroxide, 1.67 mM 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothia201ine-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and 3 0°C.<br>
The reaction is followed for 60 seconds (15 seconds after mixing) by the change in absorbance at 418 nm, which should be m the range 0.15 to 0.30.<br>
For calculation of activity  is used an absorption coefficient of oxidized ABTS of 3 6 mM-1 cm-1 and a stoichiometry of one µmole H.O. converted per two µmole ABTS oxidized.<br>
A suitable amount of oxidoreductase to be incorporated in a water based paint composition or a drilling fluid will generally depend on the oxidoreductase, but typically an amount between about 0.01 to about 1000 mg enzyme protein per liter composition, preferably 0.1-100 mg/1, e.g. 0.1-50 mg/1 or 0.2-10 ma/ml will be suitable.<br>
Water based paint compositions preserved by oxidoreductases<br>
As /defined vide supra a water based paint which may be disinfected and/or preserved and/or conserved by an oxidoreductase is a composition comprising a solid matter dissolved cr dispersed in a liquid vehicle comprising an oxidoreductase and at least 10 % water, which when spread over a surface, dries up to leave a thin colored, decorative and/or protective coating. Paints encompassed by the invention includes paints suitable for indoors use and paints for I outdoors used as well as water based wood impregnation paints.<br><br>
As mention vide supra the invention provides in one aspect a preserved water based paint comprising an oxidoreductase, an oxidizing agent, at least 10% water and a binder.<br>
Usually water constitutes 10-90% w/w of the total composition, preferably 20-80% w/w such as 30-70% w/w or 30-50% w/w of the total composition.<br>
The binder which may be used in the paint composition include acrylic compounds such as acrylstyrene, acrylate or acylate copolymers. Also a binder such as polyvinylacetate or other such polymers and/or copolymers thereof may be used. Also any suitable combination of binders may be employed. Binders may preferable constitute 5-50% w/w of the total paint composition, preferably 5-40% w/w such as 10-30% w/w.<br>
A suitable choice of oxidizing agent depends on the type<br>
of oxidoreductase. If the oxidoreductase is a laccase or a<br>
laccase related enzyme the oxidizing agent may be molecular<br>
oxygen available from the atmosphere. Usually oxygen from the<br>
atmosphere is sufficient but the paint composition may also be<br>
saturated with oxygen e.g. aeration if necessary. A particular<br>
advantageous feature of using laccases for preservation and/or<br>
conservation is that the oxidizing agent,  namely molecular<br>
oxygen, is abundantly available from the atmosphere, so that<br>
when e.g. a paint composition is exposed to microbial activity<br>
from the environment, e.g. by opening a sealed container in<br>
which paint compositions are usually stored,  access to the<br>
composition is also provided for the oxidizing agent which<br>
initiates and/or boosts the disinfecting and/or preserving<br>
and/or conserving activity of the laccase preservation system.<br><br>
If the oxidoreductase is a peroxidase or a compound having peroxidase activity the oxidizing agent is suitably a peroxo compound in particular hydrogen peroxide or a source of hydrogen peroxide (a hydrogen peroxide precursor) which provide for in situ production of hydrogen peroxide, e.g., percarbonate or perborate compounds or a peroxycarboxylic acid or a salt thereof, or it may be a hydrogen peroxide generating enzyme system, such as an oxidase and its substrate. Useful oxidases may be, a glucose oxidase, a glycerol oxidase or an amino acid oxidase. An example of an amino acid oxidase is given in WO 94/25574.<br>
It may be advantageous to use enzymatically generated<br>
hydrogen peroxide, since this source results in a relatively<br>
low concentration of hydrogen peroxide under the biologically<br>
relevant conditions. Low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide<br>
result in an increase in the rate of peroxidase-catalysed<br>
reaction. The oxidizing agent in this case may suitably be<br>
present in the preserved paint or drilling fluid composition<br>
of the invention in an amount corresponding to levels from<br>
0.001-500 mH, particularly to levels from 0.01-100 mM such as<br>
0.01-25 mM.<br>

Foam suppressers, which may be used in the paint composition include mineral oils, silicone oils and fatty acid esters or any suitable combination of such foam suppressors. The foam suppressor may constitute 0-5% w/w of the total paint composition preferably 0-3% w/w such as 0.1-0.5% w/w or 0.2-<br>
0	. 5% w/w.<br>
Siccatives, which may be used in the paint composition include metal salts of organic acids such as cobaltoctoate, zirconiumoctoate, calciumnaphtenate or zinknaphtenat or any suitable combination thereof. The siccatives may constitute 0-5% w/w of the total paint composition preferably 0-2% w/w such as 0-1% w/w or 0.1-1% w/w or 0.1-0.5% w/w.<br>

is preferred that  the paint composition of the invention<br>
comprises at least one enhancer. The invention encompasses<br>
also paint  compositions  comprising two or more different<br>
enhancers,   because   different   enhancers   preserve   the<br>
composition against different microorganisms with different<br>
potency.  Thus  by  combining  enhancers  it  is  possible  to<br>
	optimize preservation of the paint composition.<br><br>

Water based fluid compositions for use in the oil and gas industry<br>
As mentioned, supra,     the invention also relates to a<br>
preserved  and/or  conserved  water  based  fluid  composition<br>
selected  from  the  group  consisting  of  drilling  fluids,<br>
completion  fluids,  fracturing  fluids,  injection  fluids,<br>
blocking gels and workover fluids said fluids comprising an<br>
oxidoreductase, an oxidizing agent and a biopolymer. In the<br>
oil and gas industry a range of different fluids are used<br>
during the course of drilling for and production of fossil oil<br>
and/gas. The fluids often contain biopolymers or other organic<br>
components to give the fluid e.g. viscosifying or gelling<br>
properties.  To  prevent  microbial  degradation  of  these<br>
components,  biocides  such as glutaraldehyde  and different<br>
oxidisers are typically added to the fluid system. Instead of<br>
the traditional biocides used in this industry,  an enzyme<br>
based preservation system may be used in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
The biopolymer may be based on starches, such as corn, potato, rice or other grain starches, celluloses or derivatives thereof, guar gums and/or xanthan gum, which are excellent substrates for a range of different microorganisms. If the polymer structure is degraded by microbial attack the polymer looses its properties which can be detrimental in a process where the biopolymer secures the right fluid or gel<br><br>
properties. Undesired polymer degradation may in the worst case cause safety problems while a less hazardous consequence may be failure of the drilling operation and thereby loss of ' valuable time and financial resources. The fluids which usually reo-jires addition of biocides includes but are not limited to drilling fluids, completion fluids, fracturing fluids, injection fluids, blocking gels and workover fluids. Other fluid types used in the oil and gas industry which are not specifically mentioned above but which contain conventional biocides is also encompassed by the invention.<br>
When preserving such fluids the oxidoreductase enzymes and oxidizing agent as described, vide supra, may suitably be employed. Further it may be desirable to include enhancers as described, supra, in the fluid composition.<br>
Addition of the oxidoreductase preservation systems can suitably be carried out during the mixing process of the different fluid types, which may take place at ambient temperature and of importance when using laccase types of enzymes in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. This means that the fluid is sanitised during m.ixing, before being pumped down the bore hole.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following unlimiting<br>
examples  of  oxidoreductase  preserved  water  based  paint<br>
 composition  and  oxidoreductase  preserved  drilling  fluid<br>
compositibns.<br>
Example 1<br>
The  following example of  an enzymatically preserved water based paint suitable for indoors use was prepared:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The  following example of  an enzymatically preserved water based paint suitable for outdoors use was prepared:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The  following example  of an enzymatically preserved water   based   paint    suitable    for   outdoors    wood<br>
protection/impregnation:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The preservative effect of Myceliophthora laccase (Novo Nordisk<br>
A/S) with methylsyrignate as enhancer was evaluated by addition<br>
of the enzyme system to paint.   The test is an accelerated<br>
storage test, where the enzyme system is added to un-preserved<br>
paint.  The test paint was made from the following ingrediens<br>
(% W/V) ;  water  (27%) ,  Foamaster DNH-1  (0.1%) ,  Dispex N40<br>
(0.4%) ;  Celaccl  HPM 15000DS  (0.4%) ,  Ammonia 0,88  (0.03%),<br>
Tiona  535  (15%) ,  Talc  IT Extra  (5%) .     Satintone W  (5%) ,<br>
Microdol  H400  (13%) ,      Latex  (acryl)  (33 .5%) ,  Tilcom  AT23<br>
(0.5%) .   The enzyme system was added to the test paint and<br><br>
aged for 14 days at 45°C, after which the paint is inoculated with a mixture of 4 fungi (Geotrichuin candidum, Penicillium crysogenum, Penicillium corylophilum, Fusarium sp.) and 5 bacterial strains [Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas testosteroni, Bacillus fusiformis) . The inoculation is repeated 10 times with 3-4 days interval, and each time the paint is inoculated, the outgrowth of microorganisms in the paint is evaluated by spreading of 10 µL paint on TSB-agar plates. Growth is measured as the number of out growing colonies and if more than 200 colonies are counted then the paint is considered putrefied.<br><br>
Growth was obtained in the paint after 6 inoculations.   The<br>
laccase system resulted in a total inhibition of microbial outgrowth, whereas the methylsyringate showed no antimicrobial activity unless combined with the enzyme.<br><br><br><br>
