The invention relates to a coupling piece for the detachable connection of corner fittings of adjacent con¬tainers, especially of containers stacked one above the other on board ships, according to the preamble of Claim 1 and 9 respectively.<br>
Coupling pieces of the type stated at the begin¬ning are usually referred to in the jargon of the trade as "twistlocks". These coupling pieces are predominantly used to join together containers which are to be trans¬ported on board ships. Relative displacements of the containers during marine transport are thereby intended to be prevented.<br>
In order to minimize the manual activities involved in locking and unlocking the coupling pieces and hence to reduce costly lay times of ships in ports, semi¬automatic coupling pieces are used. These are pre-locked manually to one of the containers to be connected. A definitive locking is automatically carried out once the containers to be connected have been placed one on top of the other. When unloading, in order to detach the con¬nected containers, the coupling piece has to be actuated manually. From WO 8807006 Al, a coupling piece is known which has an actuating device displaying a single pull rope. This pull rope has the drawback however that the coupling piece can only be used in a certain relative arrangement to the containers to be connected. An incor¬rect arrangement of the coupling piece results in a definitive locking not being automatically realized. A further drawback consists in the fact that the known coupling piece, should it be inadvertently unlocked, cam no longer be locked. Finally, nor is it possible for this coupling piece to be xincoupled, according to choice, from the upper or lower container.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a universally esqployable, semi-automatic coupling<br><br><br>
V*"<br>
piece which ensures simple, error-free operation.<br>
A coupling piece for achieving this object displays the features defined In Claim 1. As a result of the actuating device provided according to the invention with two pull cords, it is possible to twist the locking bolt in opposite directions. Operating errors and, in particular, incorrectly realized lockings can be avoided or wiped out with the coupling piece according to the invention by the pull cords which are present in duplicate. In addition, the coupling piece according to the invention is universally employaible.<br>
Prefereibly, the two pull cords are formed from (half-length) portions of a single flexurally slack or flexurally elastic actuating means, for exeunple a rope or a rope-like cord. Opposite ends of the actuating means are provided with a respective actuating end. It is also possible to use two separate, shorter actuating means for the creation of each pull cord. In this case, one free end of each actuating means has its own actuating end.<br>
A further coupling piece for achieving the object forming the basis of the invention displays the features defined in Claim 9. Accordingly, the crossbolts of the locking bolt are of essentially Identical configuration. Because of this, there is no need to take care to ensure that the coupling piece is pre-locked with a certain crossbolt to one of the containers to be connected. Rather, the coupling piece can be optionally revolved, namely can be pre-locked both with the upper and with the lower crossbolt to one of the containers. The require¬ments placed upon the operation of semi-automatic coup¬ling pieces using optional actuating means are thereby able to be simplified in a surprisingly simple manner. Particularly in connection with a coupling piece of the eUDOve-described claims, which coupling piece displays an actuating device having two pull cords, such a simple-to-operate coupling piece is obtained, in which operating errors are virtually precluded amd unlocking by selective detachment of the coupling piece from the upper or lower container is ensured. Insofar as operating errors are<br><br>
made, these can be wiped out again without difficulty using the coupling piece according to the invention.<br>
Further subclaims relate to preferred refinements of the coupling piece.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a coupling piece for the detachable connection of containers, especially of containers stacked one above the other on board ships, comprising a housing, a twistable locking bolt, which displays a middle part mounted rotatably in the said housing and crossbolts disposed at opposite ends of the middle part, and having an actuating device for twisting the said locking bolt, characterised in that the actuating device provided with at least two pull cords for twisting the locking bolt in opposite directions.<br>

The coupling piece which is here shown serves the semi-automatic connection of containers stacked one on top of the other, which are not represented in the figures. The coupling piece is essentially composed of a housing 20, a locking bolt 21, an actuating device 22 and a fixing device 23.<br>
The housing 20 of the coupling piece which is here shown is configured in two parts. It comprises two housing halves 24 and 25, which are screwed together in a central partition plane 26. The partition plane 26 runs longitudinally through the middle of a through bore 27 in the housing 20. The partition plane 26 auid the through bore 27 rvm, in relation to that usage position of the coupling piece shown in Figs. 1 and 2, vertically through the housing 20.<br>
The outer part of the housing 20 is divided into three portions, namely into a central counter-bearing 28, which, when containers are stacked one on top of the other, comes to lie between adjacent corner fittings of the containers (not shown) as a spacer, and two middle pieces 29 and 30 disposed on opposite sides of the cotinter-bearing 28. The middle pieces 29 and 30 jut, when the containers are coupled together, into corresponding long holes in the corner fittings of containers lying one eJaove the other.<br>
The locking bolt 21 is composed of an essentially cylindrical middle part 31 and two crossbolts 32 emd 33. The locking bolt 21 is configured in one piece, for which purpose the crossbolts 32 euid 33 are formed onto opposite ends of the middle part 31. With the middle part 31, the locking bolt 21 is mounted rotateOily aQjout its longitudi¬nal centre axis 34 in the through bore 27 of the housing 20. The two crossbolts 32 and 33 jut out of opposite ends  housing 20. The crossbolts 32 and 33 are thereby above the respective middle piece 29 and 3 0 of<br><br>
the housing.<br>
The two crossbolts 32 and 33 of the locking bolt 21 are configured, according to the Invention, essential¬ly Identically. Each of the crossbolts 32 and 33 has, on Its (rear) side pointing to the respective middle piece 29 and 3 0 of the housing 20, an approximately rectangular base surface (Fig. 12) . Starting therefrom, each crossbolt 32, 33 tapers conlcally towards Its free end, which consequently displays a flat tip 35. On the parallel, long sides of each crossbolt 32 and 33 there are disposed diagonally opposing projections 36. These protrude In some regions relative to the rectangular base surface of each crossbolt 32, 33 (Fig. 13). The top sides of the projections 36 run obliquely to the tip 35 of the respective crossbolt 32, 33. The crossbolts 32, 33 thereby acquire a spiral running from the tip 3 5 to the projections 36. The bottom sides of the projections 36 are provided. In respect of each crossbolt 32 and 33, with bevels 37. The bevels 37 and the spiral of the top side of each crossbolt 32 and 33 have a pitch which Is chosen such that. In certain positions of the respective crossbolt 32 and 33 relative to the corner fitting of the corresponding container, the crossbolt In question automatically twists the locking bolt 21 as It Is Inserted Into the comer fitting or as It Is pulled out of the corner fitting.<br>
Furthermore, It Is envisaged according to the Invention that the one crossbolt 32 Is offset relative to the other crossbolt 33, to be precise by approximately 90° (Fig. 13). Whenever, accordingly, the coupling piece Is revolved, so that the lower crossbolt 33 Is on top, and then the locking bolt 21 Is twisted by 90" aJaout the longitudinal centre axis 34, the originally lower crossbolt 33 makes Its way into a position in which the previously upper crossbolt 32 was located.<br>
Inside the housing 20 there is disposed a fixing<br><br>
device 23, which fixes the locking bolt 21 in the three different settings according to Figs. 3, 6 and 9. The fixing device 23 Is composed of a spring-loaded ram 38<br><br>
mounted in the housing 20 and a link plate 39 assigned to the locking bolt 21, which link plate corresponds with the ram 38. The link plate 39 is moiinted non-twistcQsly on the middle part 31 of the locking bolt 21 and can there¬fore be twisted together with the locking bolt 21. The spring-loaded ram 3 8 is displaceable on a transverse centre axis 40, which runs centrally through the coxinter-bearing 28 of the housing 20 and ' perpendicularly intersects the longitudinal centre axis 34 of the locking bolt 21. A ram plate 41 of the spring-loaded ram 38 is pretensioned by a spring, naunely a pressure spring 42, in the direction of the locking bolt 21. A front stop face<br>
43	of the ram plate 41, which stop face perpendicularly<br>
intersects the transverse centre axis 40, is thereby<br>
forced against the link plate 39.<br>
Whenever the locking bolt 21 of the coupling piece is in the definitive locking setting according to Fig. 9, which connects the two adjacent containers and in which both crossbolts 32 and 33 are out of convergence with the middle pieces 29 and 30 on the housing 20 (Figs. 10 and 11) , a stop face 44 of the link plate 39 bears against the stop face 43 of the ram plate 41. The spring-loaded ram 38, with the assistance of the link plate 39, thereupon fixes the locking bolt 21 in the definitive locking setting of the coupling piece (Fig. 9).<br>
At both opposite ends of the stop face 44, the link plate 3 9 respectively has a protruding boss 45 and 46. In the pre-locked setting of the coupling piece, when the upper crossbolt 32 is out of convergence with the middle piece 29 of the housing 20 (Figs. 6 and 7) but the lower crossbolt 33, apart from the projections 36, coincides with the middle piece 30 of the housing 20, the boss 45 of the link plate 39 lies in bearing contact in a central depression 47 of a groove 4 8 in the stop face<br>
44	of the rsun plate 41 (Fig. 6) . The locking bolt 21 of<br>
   the coupling piece is thereby fixed in the pre-locked<br>
setting. In contrast, the opposite boss 46 of the ram<br>
plate 41 lies in bearing contact in the depression 47 of<br>
groove 48 of the ram plate 41 (Fig. 3) whenever the<br><br>
upper crossbolt 32 is in its unlocked setting (Fig. 4) but the lower crossbolt 33 is locked (Fig. 5).<br>
The actuating device 22 has, according to the invention, two flexurally elastic and/or flexurally slack pull cords 57 and 58. The two pull cords 57 and 58 are £ormed from a single actuating means, which is configrured, ' in the illustrative embodiment shown, as a continuous rope 49. In each case, approximately one half of the rope 49 forms a pull cord 57 and 58 respectively. A middle region of the rope 49, which joins together the pull cords 57 and 58, is connected at a junction point 50 to the link plate 39 of the locking bolt 21. To this end, the rope 49 is guided through a treuisversely directed eyelet 51 on the rear side of the ram plate 41 pointing away from the stop face 44 and on the opposite sides of the eyelet 51 is fixed, such that it is non-displacesd}le in the longitudinal direction, by a respective thickening in the form of a press sleeve 52 on the rope 49. In this way, pulling on one end of that portion of the rope 49 which forms the one pull cord 57 encLbles the locking bolt 21 to be twisted clockwise and pulling on the opposite end of the rope 49, nsunely on the pull cord 58, eneQjles it to be twisted anti-clockwise.<br>
The equal-length pull cords 57 and 58 of the rope 49, which extend to both sides of the eyelet 51, are gxiided out of the housing 2 0 through a flat lateral face 53 of the counter-bearing 28. For this purpose, on opposite sides of the transverse centre axis 40 there are disposed in the counter-bearing 2 8 of the housing 20 through-bores 54, which correspond with the pull cords 57 and 58 respectively. The through-bores 54 run parallel at respectively equal distance from the transverse centre eucis 40 (Figs. 3, 6 and 9) . Ends of the pull cords 57 and 58, which ends jut out of the housing 20, are respective¬ly configured as actuating ends. To this end, each of the two actuating ends is provided with a knob 55, 56. The<br>
coupling piece according to the invention consequently has two actuating ends, running symmetrically to the<br>
 centre axis 40, on each pull cord 57, 58,<br><br>
which can be manually operated by means of the knobs 55 and 56 respectively.<br>
By pulling on the respective actuating end, namely the knob 55 or the knob 56, the locking bolt 21 is twisted either clockwise or anti-cloclcwise. In concrete terms, the locking and unlocking operations proceed as follows:<br>
By pulling on the knob 56, the coupling piece makes its way into the setting shown in Figs. 3 to 5. The upper crossbolt 32 is herein in an unlocked setting for insertion into the lower corner fitting of an upper container. After this, by a pulling on the knob 55, the locking bolt 21 is twisted clockwise to the point where the upper crossbolt 32 is in a locked setting, but the lower crossbolt 33 assxomes a setting which is suitcQsle for insertion into the upper corner fitting of a lower container (Figs. 6 to 8). When the coupling piece, which is pre-locked in this way beneath the upper container, is threaded into the corner fitting of the lower container, as a result of the diagonally opposing projections 36 on the lower crossbolt 33, the locking bolt 21 is twisted anti-clockwise into a position which enables the spring-loaded ram 38, once the upper container has been fully set down on the lower container, to twist the locking bolt further anti-clockwise into the position shown in Figs. 9 to 11. In this position, the coupling piece is definitively bolted, in that both crossbolts 32, 33 are in a locking position and this is fixed by bearing contact of the stop face 43 of the spring-loaded ram 38 against the stop face 44 of the link plate 39 on the locking bolt 21 (Fig. 9).<br>
In order to detach the connection of the con¬tainers, the coupling piece according to the invention admits two alternatives.<br>
According to a first alternative, by pulling on<br>
the knob 55, the locking bolt 21 is twisted clockwise<br>
the position shown in Figs. 6 to 8. In this posi-<br>
tion, the coupling piece can be pulled by the unlocked<br>
lower crossbolt 33 out of the upper comer fitting of the<br><br>
lower container, for which purpose the bevels 37 on that (bottom) side of the lower crossbolt 33 directed towards the housing 20 rotate the locating bolt back slightly anti-clockwise to allow the diagonally opposing projections 3 6 on the crossbolt 33 to be threaded out of the long hole of the corresponding comer fitting of the upper container. The coupling piece is in this case raised with the upper container from the lower container.<br>
In the second alternative, the locking bolt, by pulling on the knob 56, is twisted anti-clockwise to the point where the unlocked upper crossbolt 32 can be pulled out of the lower corner fitting of the upper container. In this case, the upper container can be raised alone, the coupling piece, as a result of being cmchored in the upper corner fitting, remaining on the lower container (Figs. 3 to 5).<br>
The two actuating ends or pull cords 57, 58 of the coupling piece according to the invention, which actuating ends are formed by the knobs 55 euid 56, make it possible for a coupling piece which has been inadvertent¬ly opened by pulling on the knob 55 to be reclosable by pulling on the opposite knob 56, until all actuating ends or knobs 55, 56 have an approximately equal distance from the lateral face 53 of the housing 2 0 and the coupling piece thus makes its way into the definitive locking position shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Furthermore, the identical configuration of the crossbolts 32, 33 and the relative arrangement of the crossbolts 32, 33 one to another, which is purposefully offset by 90°, in conjunction with the symmetrically configured housing 20 and the two pull cords 57, 58 jutting out of the housing at equal distance from the transverse centre axLa 40, result in the coupling piece being able to be pre-locked with aoiy crossbolt, i.e. both with the upper crossbolt 32 shown in the figures and, according to choice, with the lower crossbolt 33, in the lower comer fitting of an upper container. In the coupling piece according to the invention, operating<br><br>
Pigs. 14 and 15 show a second illustrative embodiment of the coupling piece according to the inven¬tion. This differs from the coupling piece according to the first illustrative embodiment of Figs. 1 to 13 by virtue of its fixing device. Otherwise, the coupling piece of Figs. 14 and 15 corresponds to that of Figs. 1 to 13, for which reason identical reference numerals are used for identical parts.<br>
The fixing device 59 has a spring-loaded raun 60, the ram plate 61 of which displays a convex stop face 62. In concrete terms, the stop face 62 is of V-shaped configuration, in that it is composed of two part-faces 63 running at an obtuse angle of greater than 90° to each other. The two part-faces 63 meet on a vertical apex line 64, which lies on a vertical centre plane of the coupling piece, which plane rxins through the longitudinal centre axis 34 of the locking bolt 21. The link plate 65 of the fixing device 59, which link plate corresponds with the spring-loaded reun 60, is connected non-twistably to the locking bolt 21 and has three stop faces 66, 67 emd 68. The central stop face 66, when the coupling piece is definitively locked, bears fully against the stop face 62 of the spring-loaded reun 60 (Fig. 14) . To this end, the stop face 66 is configured such that it corresponds to the V-shaped stop face 62 on the ram plate 61. Accord¬ingly, the stop face 66 likewise has two part-faces 69, which run in a V-shape concavely to each other. At opposite sides of the stop face 66 there respectively adjoins one of the stop faces 67 and 68 respectively. When the upper crossbolt 32 is unlocked, the stop face 68 of the link plate 65 bears against a part-face 63 of the stop face 62 of the spring-loaded ram 60 (Fig. 15) . A fixing of the locking bolt 21 consequently takes place, the upper crossbolt 32 being unlocked. Conversely, the opposite stop face 67 bears against a part-face 63 of the stop face 62 of the spring-loaded ram 60 whenever the     lower crossbolt 33 is in am unlocked state.<br>
	In its operation, the coupling piece according to<br>
the second illustrative embodiment (Figs. 14 and   15)<br><br><br>
corresponds to the coupling piece o£ the first illustra¬tive embodiment of the invention (Figs. 1 to 13). Refer¬ence is therefore made in full to the content of the working description relating to the coupling piece according to the first illustrative embodiment of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
