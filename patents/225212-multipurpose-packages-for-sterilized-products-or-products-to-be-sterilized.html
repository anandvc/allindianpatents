				<td>MULTIFUNCTIONAL PACKAGING FOR STERILE PRODUCTS OR<br>
PRODUCTS INTENDED TO BE STERILIZED<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
sterile or sterilized packaging, and more particularly<br>
to packaging intended to transport sterilized products<br>
or products intended to be sterilized.<br>
The conditions of sterility in which certain<br>
stages of the handling or transportation of products or<br>
instruments intended for medical use are to be<br>
performed are extremely strict, particularly in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry. It is therefore extremely<br>
important to produce packaging compatible with such<br>
requirements.<br>
In the remainder of the description, mention<br>
will be made of a certain number of expressions, which<br>
we need to define below.<br>
The expression "selectively impervious", as<br>
used in the present description and in the claims, is<br>
to be understood as meaning that the material is<br>
designed, in terms of structure, to control any<br>
exchange between the inside of the packaging and its<br>
external environment. This means, among other things,<br>
that the packaging is impervious, individually or in<br>
combination, to contamination by micro-organisms,<br>
bacteria and/or a biologically active material likely<br>
to come into contact with the packaging while it is<br>
being handled, while at the same time remaining<br>
permeable to a sterilization or decontamination gas,<br>
for example of the ethylene oxide type or a high-<br>
temperature sterilizing or decontaminating fluid, for<br>
example steam up to 130°C, more generally 120° to 127°C<br>
and preferably between 121° and 123°C.<br>
The expression "high temperature" is also and<br>
more generally to be understood as meaning temperatures<br>
close to the temperatures at which the plastics<br>
materials present deform.<br>
The expressions "plastic" and "plastics<br>
material" are to be understood as meaning any material<br>
chosen from the polymer families such as styrenes,<br>
acrylics, polysulphones, polycarbonates, polyesters,<br>
polyolefins, etc. including copolymers and polymer<br>
combinations and alloys. The "plastic" is, for example,<br>
polystyrene, polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
Mention will also be made of a "screen against<br>
electron irradiation", which is to be understood as<br>
including a material capable of partially or fully<br>
reflecting and/or absorbing the kinetic energy of the<br>
electrons from a beam and therefore of slowing these<br>
electrons down or even preventing them from passing<br>
through the said material.<br>
The expression "screen against light radiation"<br>
is to be understood as defining a material capable of<br>
reflecting, attenuating or preventing light radiation,<br>
for example pulsed or ultraviolet, from passing through<br>
it.<br>
The terms "transparent" and "opaque" are to be<br>
considered with respect to electron radiation on the<br>
one hand and with respect to light radiation on the<br>
other hand. A material is transparent if light<br>
radiation or electrons can pass through it when it is<br>
subjected to electron irradiation. A material is<br>
therefore opaque to electron irradiation or to light<br>
radiation if it is capable of reflecting, attenuating<br>
and/or absorbing the kinetic energy of the electrons or<br>
if it prevents light radiation from passing through it.<br>
The opacity and/or transparency of a material are<br>
usually determined by parameters such as the thickness,<br>
density and coefficient of reflection or of<br>
attenuation.<br>
Packaging for sterile products or products<br>
intended to be sterilized with a gas of the ethylene<br>
oxide type and comprising a tub made of plastic and a<br>
cover made of selectively impervious material allowing<br>
the said tub to be sealed with an impervious sealing<br>
zone are known.<br>
Certain types of packaging such as those used<br>
for transporting syringes before they are filled with<br>
an active product or drug are currently transported in<br>
plastic boxes, for example made of polystyrene, covered<br>
with a cover sheet made of a selectively impervious<br>
material. The latter is, for example, a sheet based on<br>
filaments of HDPE (high density polyethylene) or some<br>
other polymer, bound together especially by heat and<br>
pressure. A product such as this is marketed, for<br>
example, under the trade mark TYVEK®.<br>
Products intended to be sterilized are thus<br>
placed inside a tub, which is then sealed with the<br>
selectively impervious sheet. A sterilization fluid<br>
then enters the tub through the sheet of selectively<br>
impervious material. The tub containing the sterilized<br>
products is then placed in a protective bag so that it<br>
can be transported. Another method consists in first of<br>
all placing the tub in the bag equipped with a<br>
selectively impervious zone, and then sterilizing it.<br>
By way of example, a tub or packaging such as<br>
this may contain syringes intended to be filled with a<br>
drug in a sterile room or controlled-environment room.<br>
Before the said syringes are filled, the protective bag<br>
needs to be opened and the packaging, which may be<br>
contaminated, needs to be decontaminated before it is<br>
taken, for example, into a sterile room. Such<br>
decontamination can be achieved using an electron beam<br>
developing enough energy that when it has passed<br>
through the cover sheet (selectively impervious<br>
material) it delivers a dose of irradiation of, for<br>
example, 25 kGy. This means that it can be taken that<br>
the selectively impervious material has been<br>
decontaminated throughout its thickness, particularly<br>
in the sealed zone at the interface between the tub and<br>
the said selectively impervious material.<br>
This type of decontamination using an electron<br>
beam may, however, exhibit drawbacks. This is because<br>
the electrons that may pass through the sheet of<br>
selectively impervious material carry the risk, on the<br>
one hand, of altering or adversely affecting the<br>
material of which the syringes or products placed in<br>
the tub are made, for example glass and, on the other<br>
hand, of using the oxygen in the air contained in the<br>
said tub to generate ozone. The latter may adversely<br>
affect rubber elements or components such as the caps<br>
of needles mounted on syringes, for example, or may<br>
pollute the atmosphere. Filling the syringes with a<br>
drug in an environment containing ozone may also be<br>
unadvisable.<br>
The use of decontamination using light<br>
radiation is also not advisable because the said light<br>
radiation is not able to pass through the sheet of<br>
selectively impervious material when the latter is<br>
opaque to light, which is generally the case, and is<br>
therefore not able to reach a zone located at the<br>
interface between the cover and the tub. This zone, for<br>
example containing a layer of adhesive, may exhibit<br>
irregularities and it is therefore essential that these<br>
irregularities which may be contaminated be reached<br>
with a decontamination means.<br>
Furthermore, it is to be noted that<br>
sterilization using a high-temperature sterilizing or<br>
decontaminating fluid, for example steam at 121°C,<br>
causes stress in the materials present, in this<br>
instance the material known as TYVEK® and that of the<br>
tub; given the relatively large size of the tubs and<br>
packagings, this gives rise to tension in the means of<br>
connection between the said sheet of selectively<br>
impervious material and the peripheral edge of the tub.<br>
These tensions may give rise to deformation of the tub<br>
and/or detachment between the sheet of selectively<br>
impervious material and the said tub.<br>
Other agents for sterilization via a gaseous<br>
route are, for example, vapours or plasmas of hydrogen<br>
peroxide, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid,<br>
chlorine dioxide, ozone, etc.<br>
The drawbacks of these sterilizing agents are<br>
associated with the difficulty of controlling the said<br>
vapours or plasmas, with the toxic and harmful nature<br>
of certain agents and/or residues, and with their<br>
incompatibility with certain materials.<br>
Sterilization by electromagnetic radiation, for<br>
example microwave sterilization, is also known. The<br>
same type of packaging as the one used for gaseous<br>
sterilization is then used, this being so as to allow<br>
gaseous exchanges between the external surroundings and<br>
the interior volume of the tub. These exchanges are<br>
needed because of the thermal expansions of the<br>
atmosphere inside the tub, associated with temperature<br>
variations and rises.<br>
The object of the present invention is to<br>
produce packaging for products intended to be<br>
sterilized, by any type of sterilization, and in<br>
particular sterilization with ethylene oxide (ETO) or<br>
using a high-temperature sterilizing fluid, the said<br>
packaging also being capable of being externally<br>
decontaminated using various types of decontamination<br>
and, in particular, using an electron beam, pulsed<br>
light or ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
produce packaging for products intended to be<br>
sterilized, which packaging is capable of indicating<br>
what type of sterilization and decontamination it has<br>
been subjected to.<br>
An additional object of the present invention<br>
is to produce packaging which imperviously seals a tub<br>
containing products intended to be sterilized using a<br>
sterilizing fluid of the steam or ethylene oxide type<br>
while reducing as far as possible the amount of time<br>
needed for such a sterilizing operation.<br>
The objects of the present invention are<br>
achieved using packaging for sterile products or<br>
products intended to be sterilized comprising a tub<br>
made of plastic and a cover fixed to the tub so as to<br>
seal the latter in a selectively impervious manner.<br>
According to the invention, the cover<br>
comprises:<br>
a cover sheet made of plastic, transparent to<br>
electron irradiation and light radiation;<br>
at least one window formed in the cover sheet,<br>
at least one sheet of a selectively impervious<br>
material, secured to the said cover sheet and<br>
closing off the window;<br>
and a screen which is opaque to at least an<br>
electron irradiation passing through the cover<br>
sheet or the selectively impervious material, the<br>
said screen extending inside the packaging near<br>
the cover sheet so as to allow a sterilizing gas,<br>
for example ethylene oxide or steam, to enter<br>
through the selectively impervious material.<br>
According to one embodiment of the packaging<br>
according to the invention, the cover comprises usage<br>
indicators making it possible to identify and indicate<br>
the type of sterilization and of decontamination to<br>
which it has been subjected.<br>
According to one embodiment of the packaging<br>
according to the invention, the selectively impervious<br>
material has a peripheral connecting zone over which an<br>
adhesive compatible with high-temperature sterilization<br>
is discretely or continuously spread, and a central<br>
zone which remains devoid of adhesive.<br>
The packaging according to the invention has<br>
the advantage that it can be used with several methods<br>
of sterilizing and decontaminating. The packaging can<br>
be used as it is or with predefined arrangements. It is<br>
therefore not necessary to design a special product<br>
compatible with a particular sterilization or<br>
decontamination method used.<br>
Other features and advantages will also become<br>
apparent from the detailed description given<br>
hereinafter, given by way of example, with reference to<br>
the appended drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 depicts a perspective view with partial<br>
cutaway of one example of packaging according to<br>
the invention;<br>
Figure 2 depicts the embodiment of Figure 1 in a<br>
section on II-II of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 depicts a view from above of the<br>
embodiment of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 4 depicts another embodiment of the<br>
packaging according to the invention.<br>
The packaging 2 according to the invention<br>
comprises a tub 4 (partially cut away in Figure 1)<br>
delimiting an interior volume 6 intended to contain<br>
contents to be sterilized. These contents consist, for<br>
example, of syringes 8. The tub 4 has internally for<br>
this purpose a first peripheral edge 10 extending<br>
towards the outside of the tub 4 and intended to form a<br>
ledge for a support 12 for the syringes 8. This support<br>
12 consists, for example, of a plate in which shafts or<br>
orifices are made, through which the syringes 8 pass.<br>
The tub 4 also has an upper peripheral edge 14<br>
which is roughly horizontal and extends towards the<br>
outside of the said tub 4. The latter is made, for<br>
example, of a plastic of the polystyrene type or of<br>
some other polymer. The material of which the tub 4 is<br>
made may be opaque, transparent or semitransparent to<br>
light radiation, for example radiation of visible or<br>
ultraviolet type.<br>
The packaging 2 also comprises a cover 16 fixed<br>
to the tub 4 so as to seal the latter along an<br>
impervious sealing zone. The cover 16 is, for example,<br>
bonded with its peripheral edge 16a on the upper<br>
peripheral edge 14 of the tub 4. A layer of adhesive 18<br>
provides the interface between the peripheral edge 16a<br>
and the upper peripheral edge 14. The layer of<br>
adhesive, for example of the hot melt type 18, is<br>
chosen from adhesives that can withstand high<br>
temperatures, for example of the order of 121°C,<br>
corresponding to steam sterilization.<br>
The cover 16 comprises a cover sheet 20 made of<br>
plastic for sealing the tub 4. The cover sheet 20 is<br>
transparent to electron irradiation and to light<br>
radiation, for example ultraviolet radiation. The<br>
opacity/density/thickness characteristics of the cover<br>
sheet 20 are therefore chosen accordingly. The cover<br>
sheet 20 has at least one window 22, obtained for<br>
example by any known means, particularly by cutting<br>
out. The cover sheet 20 depicted in the figures<br>
comprises two windows 22. Each window 22 has, for<br>
example, a longitudinal shape and extends near the<br>
upper peripheral edges 14 of the tub 4.<br>
The cover 16 also comprises at least one sheet<br>
24 of a selectively impervious material secured to the<br>
cover sheet 16 and closing off each of the windows 22.<br>
The selectively impervious material 24 is, for<br>
example, a material based on filaments of HDPE (high<br>
density polyethylene) or other polymers, bound together<br>
by heat and pressure. The filaments are agglomerated in<br>
such a way as to form a microporous structure,<br>
impervious in particular to the micro-organisms or<br>
other bacteria. According to one embodiment, the<br>
selectively impervious material 24 comprises TYVEK®.<br>
The sheet 24 of selectively impervious material is,<br>
with its periphery 24a, bonded onto or preferably under<br>
the cover sheet 20. The selectively impervious material<br>
may also consist of natural fibres such as plant<br>
fibres, for example cellulose fibres, compatible with<br>
high-temperature sterilization.<br>
The cover 16 is also associated with a screen<br>
26 which is opaque at least to an electron irradiation<br>
passing through the cover sheet 20. This screen 26<br>
extends into the packaging 2 near the cover sheet 20 so<br>
as to allow a sterilizing gas, for example ethylene<br>
oxide (ETO) or steam, to enter through the selectively<br>
impervious material.<br>
The screen 26 for example comprises a flexible<br>
metal foil. The screen 26 may thus consist of a<br>
flexible aluminium foil.<br>
In the embodiments depicted more particularly<br>
in Figures 1 and 2, the screen 26 is fixed under the<br>
cover sheet 20 along a fixing line 28, fixing points or<br>
a fixing zone for example near the centre of the said<br>
cover sheet 20. Any known fixing or connecting means<br>
may be envisaged for producing this fixing line 28.<br>
Fixing may, for example, be achieved by bonding,<br>
welding or goffering.<br>
According to another embodiment according to<br>
the invention, the screen 2 6 for example comprises an<br>
assembly of two sheets of selectively impervious<br>
material. An assembly such as this may also be fixed on<br>
the cover sheet 20 along the fixing line 28. The<br>
position of the peripheral edge 10 and the dimensions<br>
of the support 12 are chosen so that the screen 2 6<br>
which rests on the said support 12 on each side of the<br>
fixing line 28 extends in the vicinity of and under the<br>
cover sheet 20. The distance between the screen 26 and<br>
the cover sheet 2 0 is thus reduced as far as possible<br>
while at the same time maintaining a passage for a<br>
sterilizing gas.<br>
Another embodiment depicted in Figure 4 shows<br>
the screen 12 6 consisting, for example, of an assembly<br>
of two sheets of selectively impervious material. In<br>
this embodiment, the screen 12 6 extends under the cover<br>
sheet 20. The screen 126 also has dimensions which<br>
allow its peripheral part 126a to be sandwiched between<br>
the cover sheet 2 0 and the upper peripheral edge 14 of<br>
the tub 4. The tub 4 is sealed by the cover sheet 20 by<br>
means of the layer of adhesive 18 that provides the<br>
interface between the said cover sheet 2 0 and the said<br>
upper peripheral edge 14, and the screen 12 6 may or may<br>
not be secured to the cover sheet 2 0 and/or to the<br>
upper peripheral edge 14. According to another<br>
embodiment, the screen 12 6 is impervious. In this case<br>
the screen 126 also has orifices in fluidic<br>
communication with at least one window 22.<br>
The cover 16 of the packaging 2 according to<br>
the invention also comprises usage indicators 30<br>
identifying and indicating the nature of sterilization<br>
and decontamination to which the said packaging 2 has<br>
been subjected. The usage indicators 30, known per se,<br>
are, for example, indicators which change colour<br>
according to the treatment experienced. The person<br>
handling the packaging 2 therefore always knows to what<br>
kind of sterilization the syringes 8 have been<br>
subjected and to what kind of decontamination the<br>
packaging 2 has been subjected.<br>
The cover sheet 20 is transparent to electron<br>
radiation and to light radiation. The transparency of<br>
the cover sheet 20 with respect to electron radiation<br>
and with respect to light radiation of the pulsed-light<br>
or ultraviolet-radiation type allows a zone located at<br>
the interface between the said cover sheet 2 0 and the<br>
upper peripheral edge 14 to be decontaminated.<br>
Irregularities in the layer of adhesive 18, which may<br>
be contaminated, can thus be contaminated by an<br>
electron beam or light radiation as mentioned before.<br>
The tub 4 is made, for example, of a plastic<br>
transparent to light radiation. Transparency with<br>
respect to visible light radiation makes it possible to<br>
identify and to constantly check, during any<br>
decontamination operation, the contents of the<br>
packaging 2. The material of which the tub 4 is made<br>
for example has a density/thickness pairing such that<br>
it stops electrons from an irradiating electron beam.<br>
This makes it possible to avoid adversely affecting the<br>
products or contents contained in the packaging 2, in<br>
this instance the syringes 8, and to avoid the<br>
generation of ozone with the air.<br>
The selectively impervious material preferably<br>
has a peripheral connecting zone 24a over which an<br>
adhesive compatible with high-temperature sterilization<br>
is uniformly spread, and a central zone 24b which<br>
remains devoid of adhesive. The absence of adhesive in<br>
this central zone 24b eases and accelerates the passage<br>
of a sterilization gas of the ETO type or of steam<br>
through the selectively impervious material 24. The<br>
lengths of time needed to sterilize a packaging 2 may<br>
thus be reduced.<br>
The screen 126 extends under each window 22 so<br>
as to form a zone that is permeable to a sterilizing<br>
gas of the ETO type or steam. This gas thus passes<br>
through three layers of a selectively impervious<br>
material. Such a thickness is opaque on the one hand to<br>
light radiation and, on the other hand, to certain<br>
electron irradiations. An irradiation dose of, for<br>
example, 25 kGy after passing through the selectively<br>
impervious material that closes off the window 22 can<br>
thus be absorbed by the screen 12 6. Electrons can thus<br>
be prevented from entering the interior volume 6 and<br>
therefore creating ozone or adversely affecting the<br>
syringes 8.<br>
Such a dose of electron radiation used for<br>
decontamination is also absorbed by the screen 26 (cf.<br>
Figures 1 and 2) whose density and/or thickness are<br>
chosen accordingly. The density/thickness pairing for<br>
the cover sheet 2 0 is also chosen to make the said<br>
cover sheet 20 transparent to electron irradiation and,<br>
in particular, its peripheral part 2 0a fixed or bonded<br>
to the upper peripheral edge 14. Light radiation, for<br>
example ultraviolet radiation, can thus decontaminate<br>
the interface connecting the said cover sheet 2 0 and<br>
the upper peripheral edge 14. The screen 26 (cf.<br>
Figure 2) has, on each side of the fixing line 28,<br>
parts which are not closely connected to the cover<br>
sheet 20 and, in particular, to the selectively<br>
impervious material, so as not to impede the passage of<br>
a sterilizing gas of the ETO type or steam. This is<br>
particularly advantageous when the screen 2 6 is<br>
impermeable to a sterilizing gas, as is the case, for<br>
example, of an aluminium foil.<br>
According to another embodiment of the<br>
packaging according to the invention, it is also<br>
possible, for certain materials, to replace the layer<br>
of adhesive 18 with heat sealing.<br>
It goes without saying that the invention is<br>
not limited to the embodiment described hereinabove by<br>
way of example, but that, on the contrary, it<br>
encompasses all the alternative forms of embodiment<br>
thereof that fall within the field of protection<br>
defined by the claims appended hereto. Thus it is<br>
possible for the screen 26 to not be connected to the<br>
cover sheet at all, but simply to rest on the products<br>
contained in the packaging, on a piece contained in the<br>
packaging or on supports that the latter comprises on<br>
