Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives and their use as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Phosphatidylinositol (hereinafter abbreviated as "PI") is one of a number of phospholipids found in cell membranes. In recent years it has become clear that PI plays an important role in intracellular signal transduction. In the late 1980s, a PI3 kinase (PI3K) was found to be an enzyme which phosphorylates the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (D. Whitman et al, 1988, Nature, 332, 664).<br>
PI3K was originally considered to be a single enzyme, but it has now been clarified that a plurality of subtypes are present in PI3K. Each subtype has its own mechanism for regulating activity. Three major classes of PI3Ks have been identified on the basis of their in vitro substrate specificity (B. Vanhaesebroeck,1997, Trend in Biol. Sci, 22, 267). Substrates for class I PDKs are PI, PI 4-phosphate (PI4P) and PI 4,5-biphosphate (PI (4,5)P2). Class I PDKs are further divided into two groups, class la and class Ib, in terms of their activation mechanism. Class la PDKs include PI3K p110α, p110β and p110δ subtypes, which transmit signals from tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors. Class Ib PI3K includes a p110γ subtype activated by a G protein-coupled receptor. PI and PI(4)P are known as substrates for class II PDKs. Class II PDKs include PDK C2α, C2β and C2γ subtypes, which are characterized by containing C2 domains at the C terminus. The substrate for class III PDKs is PI only.<br>
In the PDK subtypes, the class la subtype has been most extensively investigated to date. The three subtypes of class la are heterodimers of a catalytic 110 kDa subunit and regulatory subunits of 85 kDa or 55 kDa. The regulatory subunits contain SH2 domains and bind to tyrosine residues phosphorylated by growth factor receptors with a tyrosine kinase activity or oncogene products, thereby<br>
inducing the PI3K activity of the pi 10 catalytic subunit which phosphorylates its lipid substrate. Thus, the class la subtypes are considered to be associated with cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.<br>
WO 01/083456 describes a series of condensed heteroaryl derivatives which have activity as inhibitors of PI3 K and which suppress cancer cell growth.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that a novel class of fused pyrimidine compounds are effective inhibitors of PI3K with drug-like physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The compounds exhibit selectivity for class la PBKs over class Ib, in particular for the P1l0α subtype.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound which is a used pyrimidine of formula (<br>

A suitable synthetic strategy for producing compounds of formula (I) in which m is 1 employs the precursor carboxaldehyde of formula (II):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A and R2 are as defined above. Starting from this precursor the synthesis comprises performing, in either order, a palladium-mediated (Suzuki-type) cross-coupling reaction and a reductive amination. The present invention therefore further provides a process for producing a compound of formula (I) as defined above in which m is 1, which process comprises:<br>
(a)      treating a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A and R2 are as defined above, with a boronic acid or ester thereof of formula R3B(OR15)2 , in which R3 is as defined above and each R15 is H or Ci-Cg alkyl or the two groups OR13 form, together with the boron atom to which they are attached, a pinacolato boronate ester group, in the presence of a Pd catalyst; and treating the resulting compound o f formula (III):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A, R2 and R3 are as. defined above, with an amine of formula NHR4R5 in which R4 and R5 are as defined above, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent; or<br>
(b)	treating a compound of formula (II) as defined above with an amine of formula NHR4R5 wherein R4 and R5 are as defined above, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent; and treating the resulting compound of formula (IV):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A, R , R"* and R5 are as defined above, with a boronic acid or ester thereof of formula R3B(OR.15)2 , in which R3 is as defined above and each R15 is H or Ci-C6 alkyl or the two groups OR15 form, together with the boron atom to which they are attached, a pinacolato boronate ester group, in the presence of a Pd catalyst.<br>
Both the amination step and the Pd-mediated cross-coupling step take place under conventional conditions. The palladium catalyst may be any that is typically used for Suzuki-type cross-couplings, such as PdCl2(PPh3)2. The reducing agent is typically a borohydride, for instance NaBH(OAc)3, NaBKU or NaCNBfLt, in particular NaBH(OAc)3.<br>
The pinacolato boronate ester may be, for instance, prepared as described in either of Reference Examples 5 and 6 which follow.<br>
A compound of formula (II) as defined above wherein R2 is -NR5R7 may be prepared by a process which comprises treating a compound of formula (IX):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A, R6 and R7 are as defined above, with a lithiating agent followed by N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF). The reaction is typically conducted by adding a solution of the lithiating agent in a non-polar organic solvent, for instance a hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, to a suspension of the compound of formula (IX) in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF). If THF is used the addition takes place at a low temperature, of about -78°C. The lithiating agent is typically an alkyllithium, for instance n-butyllithium.<br>
A compound of formula (IX) as defined above may be produced by a process which comprises treating a compound of formula (X):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>

A compound of formula (X) may be prepared by the process described in Reference Example 1 for the preparation of 2,4-dichloro-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine, or by analogy with such a process.<br>
A compound of formula (II) as defined above wherein R2 is of formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
may be prepared by a process which comprises submitting a compound of formula (XI):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A and R3 are as defined above, to palladium-mediated cross-coupling with a compound of formula (XII):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein L is H or a group selected from halo, -OSO2CF3, -B(OR) 2, -Sn(R)3 and -Si(R)3 wherein R is H or alkyl as defined above, followed by reduction, to yield a compound of the following formula (XIII):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A, R3 and Y are as defined above.<br>
The compound of formula (XIII) may be converted to the corresponding carboxaldehyde by treatment with a lithiating agent followed by N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF), for instance under the conditions described above for the conversion of a compound of formula (IX) to a compound of formula (II). The lithiating agent is typically as defined above. The resulting carboxaldehyde may then be converted into a desired final compound of formula (I) as defined above, in which<br>
m is 1, by treatment with an amine of formula NHR4R5 in which R4 and R5 are as defined above, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, for instance a borohydride as specified above, in particular NaBH(OAc)3.<br>
A compound of formula (I) as defined above in which m is 0 may be prepared by a Buchwald-type palladium-mediated nitrogen insertion reaction. Such a process may comprise treating a compound of formula (XIV):<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A, R2 and R3 are as defined above and W is a halo group selected from Br and I, with an amine of formula NHR4R5 in which R4 and R5 are as defined above, in the presence of a palladium catalyst.<br>
A compound of formula (XIV) may be produced by treating a compound of formula (XV):<br>
wherein A, R2 and R3 are as defined above, with a lithiating agent and a halogen selected from bromine <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and iodine. The lithiating agent is typically an alkyllithium, for instance butyllithium. The halogen is typically iodine, which gives rise to a compound of formula (XIV) in which W is I.<br>
A compound of formula (I) as defined above in which m is 0 may also be prepared by an SNAr displacement reaction, for instance under the conditions described by D. Prim and G. Kirsch in Tetrahedron 1999, 55 (21), 6511-6526. Such a process comprises treating a compound of formula (XIV) as defined above in which W is Br with an amine of formula NHR4R3 in which R4 and R5 are as defined above in HiO under reflux for 12 h.<br><br>
A compound of formula (I) as defined above in which m is 0 may alternatively be prepared by treating a compound of formula (XIV) as defined above in which W is I with an amine of formula NHR4R5 in which R4 and R5 are as defined above in 1,4-dioxane in the presence of CuI/En and KjPO^ The reaction is conducted at about 110°C for 24 h. This procedure is described by Kang S-K et al in Synlett, (3), 427-430, 2002."<br>
A fused pyrimidine of formula (I) may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and a salts may be converted into the free compound, by conventional methods. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In the case of compounds of the invention bearing a free carboxy substituent, the salts include the salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals and ammonium, for instance the salts of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium. The latter are prepared by treating the free fused pyrimidine of formula (I), or an acid addition salt thereof, with the corresponding metal base or ammonia. The compounds of formula (I) and their salts may exist as hydrates or solvates.<br>
Compound of the present invention have been found in biological tests to be inhibitors of PI3 kinase. The compounds are selective for class la PI3 kinases over class Ib and typically exhibit at least a 20-fold selectivity for class la over class Ib PI3 kinases. In particular, the compounds are selective for the pi 10a isoform.<br>
A compound of the present invention may thus be used as an inhibitor of PI3 kinase, in particular of a class la PI3 kinase. Accordingly, a compound of the present invention can be used to treat a disease or disorder arising from abnormal cell growth, function or behaviour associated with PI3 kinase. Examples of such diseases and disorders are discussed by Drees et al in Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2004) 14(5):703 - 732. These include cancer, immune disorders, cardiovascular disease,<br>
viral infection, inflammation, metabolism/endocrine disorders and neurological disorders. Exampes of metabolism/endocrine disorders include diabetes and obesity. Examples of cancers which the present compounds can be used to treat include leukaemia, brain tumours, renal cancer, gastric cancer and cancer of the skin, bladder, breast, uterus, lung, colon, prostate, ovary and pancreas. A human or animal patient suffering from an immune disorder, cancer, cardiovascular disease, viral infection, inflammation, a metabolism/endocrine disorder or a neurological disorders may thus be treated by a method comprising the administration thereto of a compound of the present invention as defined above. The condition of the patient may thereby be improved or ameliorated.<br>
In addition to possessing biochemical potency the compounds of the invention exhibit physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties which make them particularly well adapted for drug use. This is shown for instance in the results of the biological assays described in Example 3, which follows. In particular the compounds possess high aqueous solubility at physiological pH; many have a solubility of at least 40 µM and a significant number have a solubility of greater than 100µM. High solubility at physiological pH is desirable since it promotes bioavailability. The compounds also possess high metabolic stability, as shown in particular by the hepatocyte clearance assay described in Example 3 in which most of the tested compounds were shown to have low hepatocyte clearance. Low hepatocyte clearance correlates with a low rate of liver metabolism. It can therefore be seen that the compounds of the present invention possess improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties whilst retaining biochemical potency as inhibitors of PI3 kinase.<br>
A compound of the present invention can be administered in a variety of dosage forms, for example orally such as in the form of tablets, capsules, sugar- or film-coated tablets, liquid solutions or suspensions or parenterally, for example intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously. The compound may therefore be given by injection or infusion.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of present invention comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and, as an active ingredient, a compound such as herein described showed surprising effects. Therefore, the said composition is synergistic in nature.<br>
The dosage depends on a variety of factors including the age, weight and condition of the patient and the route of administration. Daily dosages can vary within wide limits and will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. Typically, however, the dosage adopted for each route of administration when a compound is administered alone to adult humans is 0.0001 to 50 mg/kg, most commonly in the range of 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, body weight, for instance 0.01 to 1 mg/kg. Such a dosage may be given, for example, from 1 to 5 times daily. For intravenous injection a suitable daily dose is from 0.0001 to 1 mg/kg body weight, preferably from 0.0001 to 0.1 mg/kg body weight. A daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or according to a divided dose schedule.<br>
A compound is formulated for use as a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition also comprising a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or diluent. The compositions are typically prepared following conventional methods and are administered in a pharmaceutically or veterinarily suitable form. The compound may be administered in any conventional form, for instance as follows:<br>
A) Orally, for example, as tablets, coated tablets, dragees, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, liquid solutions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.<br>
Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, dextrose, saccharose, cellulose, com starch, potato starch, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, maize starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; lubricating agents, for example<br>
silica, magnesium or calcium stearate, stearic acid or talc; effervescing mixtures; dyestuffs, sweeteners, wetting agents such as lecithin, polysorbates or lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Such preparations may be manufactured in a known manner, for example by means of mixing, granulating, tableting, sugar coating or film coating processes.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is present as such, or mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.<br>
The said aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspension may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol.<br>
Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by this addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally occuring phosphatides, for example soy bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids an hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan mono-oleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. In particular a syrup for diabetic patients can contain as carriers only products, for example sorbitol, which do not metabolise to glucose or which only metabolise a very small amount to glucose.<br>
Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and coloring agents;<br>
B) Parenterally, either subcutaneously, or intravenously, or intramuscularly, or intrastemally, or by infusion techniques, in the form of sterile injectable aqueous<br>
or oleaginous suspensions. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing of wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic paternally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol.<br>
Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables;<br>
C)	By inhalation, in the form of aerosols or solutions for nebulizers;<br>
D)	Rectally, in the form of suppositories prepared by mixing the drug with a<br>
suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperature but liquid at<br>
the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such<br>
materials are cocoa butter and poly-ethylene glycols;<br>
E)	Topically, in the form of creams, ointments, jellies, collyriums, solutions<br>
or suspesions.<br>

(ii) Cellular Proliferation Inhibition<br>
Cells were seeded at optimal density in a 96 well plate and incubated for 4 days in the presence of test compound. Alamar Blue™ was subsequently added to the assay medium, and cells were incubated for 6 h before reading at 544nm<br>
excitation, 590nm emission. £€50 values were calculated using a sigmoidal dose response curve fit. All the compounds tested had an ECjoS of 50uM or less in the range of cell lines utilized.<br>
(iii) Caco-2 Permeability<br>
Caco-2 cells were seeded onto Millipore Multiscreen plates at 1 x 105 cells/cm2, and were cultured for 20 days. Assessment of compound permeability was subsequently conducted. The compounds were applied to the apical surface (A) of cell monolayers and compound permeation into the basolateral (B) compartment was measured. This was performed in the reverse direction (B-A) to investigate active transport. A permeability coefficient value, Papp, for each compound, a measure of the rate of permeation of the compound across the membrane, was calculated. Compounds were grouped into low (Papp = 1.0 x 106cm/s) or high (Papp &gt;/= 1.0 x 106cm/s) absorption potential based on comparison with control compounds with established human absorption.<br>
For assessment of a compound's ability to undergo active efflux, the ratio of basolateral (B) to apical (A) transport compared with A to B was determined. Values of B-A/A-B &gt;/== 1.0 indicated the occurrence of active cellular efflux. All of the compounds tested through the Caco-2 permeability screen had Papp values &gt;/= 1.0 x 106cm/s. One compound assessed through the bidirectional assay, PI540, had an B-A/A-B asymmetry index of less than 1.0, indicating that the compound does not undergo active cellular efflux.<br>
(iv) Hepatocyte Clearance<br>
Suspensions of cryopreserved human hepatocytes were used. Incubations were performed at compound concentration of ImM or 3uM at a cell density of 0.5 x 106 viable cells/mL. The final DMSO concentration in the incubation was 0.25%. Control incubations were also performed in the absence of cells to reveal any non-enzymatic degradation. Duplicate samples (50uL) were removed from the incubation mixture at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes (control sample at 60 minutes only) and<br>
added to MeOH - containing internal standard (100µL) - to terminate the reaction. Tolbutamide, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and testosterone were used as control compounds. Samples were centrifuged and this supernatants at each time point pooled for analysis by LC-MSMS. From a plot of In peak area ratio (parent compound peak area / internal standard peak area) against time, intrinsic clearance (CLint) was calculated as follows: CLint (|il/min/million cells) = V x k, where k is the elimination rate constant, obtained from the gradient of In concentration plotted against time; Visa volume term derived from the incubation volume and is expressed as uL 106 cells"1.<br>
Compounds were classified with low (CL= 4.6uL/min/10 cells), medium (CL &gt;/= 4.6; - 25.2 ul/min/106 cells) and high (&gt;/= 25.2ul/min/106 cells) clearance. The majority of the tested compounds of the invention were determined to have low hepatocyte clearance.<br>
(V) Cvtochrome P450 Inhibition<br>
Compounds of the invention were screened against five CYP450 targets (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) at 10 concentrations in duplicate, with a top concentration of lOOuM being used. Standard inhibitors (furafylline, sulfaphenazole, tranylcypromine, quinidine, ketoconazole) were used as controls. Plates were read using a BMG LabTechnologies PolarStar in fluorescence mode. The majority of the tested compounds assessed in this assay displayed weak activity (ICso &gt;/=5uM) against all isoforms of CYP450.<br>
(yi) Cvtochrome P450 Induction<br>
Freshly isolated human hepatocytes from a single donor were cultured for 48 h prior to addition of test compound at three concentrations and were incubated for 72 h. Probe substrates for CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were added for 30 minutes and 1 h before the end of the incubation. At 72 h, cells and media were removed and the extent of metabolism of each probe substrate quantified by LC-MS/MS. The experiment was controlled by using inducers of the individual P450s incubated at one concentration in triplicate. The compounds of the invention assessed in this assay<br>
showed negligible effects on induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes.<br>
(vii) Plasma Protein Binding<br>
Solutions of test compound (Sum, 0.5% final DMSO concentration) were prepared in buffer and 10% plasma (v/v in buffer). A 96 well HT dialysis plate was assembled so that each well was divided in two by a semi-permeable cellulose membrane. The buffer solution was added to one side of the membrane and the plasma solution to the other side; incubations were then conducted at 37°C over 2 h in triplicate. The cells were subsequently emptied, and the solutions for each batch of compounds were combined into two groups (plasma-free and plasma-containing) then analysed by LC-MSMS using two sets of calibration standards for plasma-free (6 points) and plasma-containing solutions (7 points). The fraction unbound value for each compound was calculated: highly protein bound compounds (&gt;/=90% bound) had an Fu =0.1. The compounds of the invention assessed in this assay had Fu values &gt;/= 0.1.<br>
(viii) hERG channel blockage<br>
Compounds of the invention were evaluated for their ability to modulate rubidium efflux from HEK-294 cells stably expressing hERG potassium channels using established flux methodology. Cells were prepared in medium containing RbCl and were plated into 96-well plates and grown overnight to form monolayers. The efflux experiment was initiated by aspirating the media and washing each well with 3 x lOOjaL of pre-incubation buffer (containing low [K"1"]) at room temperature. Following the final aspiration, 50uL of working stock (2x) compound was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. 50uL of stimulation buffer (containing high [K+]) was then added to each well giving the final test compound concentrations. Cell plates were then incubated at room temperature for a further 10 minutes. 80uL of supernatant from each well was then transferred to equivalent wells of a 96-well plate and analysed via atomic emission spectroscopy.<br><br>
Compounds were screened as lOpt duplicate ICso curves, n~2, from a top concentration of lOOuM.<br>
