Description<br>
TRANSMISSION RATE CONTROL METHOD, MOBILE STATION, AND RADIO<br>
NETWORK CONTROLLER<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission rate control method for controlling a transmission rate of user data transmitted by a mobile station via an uplink, the mobile station, and a radio network controller.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
In a conventional mobile communication system, in an uplink from a mobile station UE to a radio base station Node 33, a radio network controller RNC is conifigured to determine a transmission rate of a dedicated channel, in consideration of radio resources of the radio base station Node B, an interference volume in an uplink, transmission power of the mobile station UE, transmission processing performance of the r mobile station UE, a transmission rate required for an upper application, and the like, and to notify the determined transmission rate of the dedicated channel by a message of a layer-3 (Radio Resource Control Layer) to both of the mobile station UE and the radio base station Node B.<br>
Here, the radio network controller RNC is provided at an upper level of the radio base station Node B, and is an apparatus configured to control the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE.<br>
In general, data communications often cause burst traffic<br><br>
compared with voice communications or TV communications. Therefore, it is preferable that a transmission rate of a channel used for the data communications is changed fast.<br>
However, as shown in FIG. 1, the radio network controller RNC integrally controls a plurality of radio base stations Node B in general. Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been a problem that it is difficult to perform fast control for changing of the transmission rate of channel (for example, per approximately 1 through 10 0 ms) , due to processing load, processing delay, or the like.<br>
In addition, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been also a problem that costs for implementing an apparatus and for operating a network are substantially increased even if the fast control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel can be performed.<br>
Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel is generally performed on the order from a few hundred ms to a few seconds.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional mobile communication system, when burst data transmission is performed as shown in FIG. 2(a), the data are transmitted by accepting low-speed, high-delay, and low-transmission efficiency as shown in FIG. 2(b) , or, as shown in FIG. 2(c) , by reserving radio resources for high-speed communications to accept that radio bandwidth resources in an unoccupied state and hardware resources in the radio base station Node B are wasted.<br>
It should be noted that both of the above-described radio<br><br>
bandwidth resources and hardware resources are applied to the vertical radio resources in FIGS. 2(b) and 2(c).<br>
Therefore, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) , which are international standardization organizations of the third generation mobile communication system, have discussed a method for controlling radio resources at high speed in a layer-1 and a media access control (MAC) sub-layer (a layer-2) between the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, so as to utilize the radio resources effectively. Such discussions or discussed functions will be hereinafter referred to as "Enhanced Uplink (EUL)".<br>
Radio resource control methods that have been discussed in the "Enhanced Uplink" can be broadly categorized into three as follows. The radio resource control methods will be briefly described below.<br>
First, a radio resource control method that is referred to as "Time &amp; Rate Control" has been discussed.<br>
In such a radio resource control method, a radio base station Node B determines a mobile station UE which can transmit user data and a transmission rate of user data of the mobile station UE per a predetermined timing, so as to signal information relating to a mobile station ID as well as the transmission rate of user data (or a maximum allowable transmission rate of user data).<br>
The mobile station UE that is designated by the radio base station Node B transmits user data at the designated timing and the transmission rate (or within a range of the maximum  allowable transmission rate).<br><br>
Second, a radio resource control method that is referred to as "Rate Control per UE" has been discussed.<br>
In such a radio resource control method, if there is user data that should be transmitted to the radio base station Node B, each mobile station UE can transmit the user data. However, the maximum allowable transmission rate of the user data, which is determined by the radio base station Node B and signaled to each mobile station UE for each transmission frame or each of a plurality of transmission frames, is used.<br>
Here, when the maximum allowable transmission rate is signaled, the radio base station Node B signals the maximum allowable transmission rate itself, or a relative value thereof (for example, binary of an "Up command" and a "Down command") , at this timing.<br>
Third, a radio resource control method that is referred ro as "Rate Control per Cell" has been discussed.<br>
In such a radio resource control method, a radio base station Node B signals a transmission rate of user data, which is common among mobile stations UE in communication, or information needed to calculate the transmission rate, and each mobile station UE determines a transmission rate of user data based on the received information.<br>
Ideally, the "Time &amp; Rate Control", and the "Rate Control per UE" can be the best control methods for improving radio capacity in an uplink. However, a transmission rate of user data has to be granted after data volume stored in buffers of the mobile station UE, transmission power in the mobile station UE, or the like are grasped. Therefore, there has been a problem that control load is increased by the radio base station Node<br><br>
In addition, in these radio resource control methods, there has been a problem that overhead becomes larger by exchanges of control signals.<br>
On the other hand, in the "Rate Control per Cell", there is an advantage in that control load by the radio base station Node B is small since the radio base station Node B signals information which is common in cells, and each mobile station UE autonomously seeks the transmission rate of user data based on the received information.<br>
However, the radio base station Node B has to be configured in such a manner that the user data in the uplink from any mobile station UE can be received. Therefore, there has been a problem that an apparatus size of radio base station Node 5 becomes large to effectively utilize the radio capacxry cf rhe uplink.<br>
Accordingly, there has been proposed, for example, a scheme (Autonomous ramping method) that the mobile station UE increases the transmission rate of user data from a pre-notif ied initial transmission rate in accordance with predetermined rules so that excessive allocation of radio capacity by the radio base station Node B can be prevented, thereby preventing increase of the apparatus size of radio base station Node B.<br>
In such a scheme, a radio base station Node B determines a maximum allowable transmission rate based on hardware resources and radio bandwidth resources (for example, an interference volume in an uplink) in each cell, so as to control the transmission rate of user data in communicating mobile stations UE. Detailed descriptions of a control scheme based on hardware resources and a control scheme based on an<br><br>
interference volume in an uplink will be given below.<br>
In the control scheme based on the hardware resources, a radio base station Node B is configured to signal a maximum allowable transmission rate to a mobile station UE connected to a cell under the control thereof.<br>
The radio base station Node B lowers the maximum allowable transmission rate so as to avoid shortage of the hardware resources when the transmission rate of user data in the mobile station UE connected to the cell under the control thereof is increased and the hardware resources are insufficient.<br>
On the other hand, the radio base station Node B again increases the maximum allowable transmission rate when the space of the hardware resources become larger at a time of completion of user data transmission in the mobile station UE connected to the cell under the control tnerecf, or the like.<br>
In addition, in the control sciieme based on the interference volume in the uplink, a radio base station Node B is configured to signal a maximum allowable transmission rate to a mobile station UE connected to a cell under the control thereof.<br>
When the transmission rate of user data in the mobile station UE connected to the cell under the control of a radio base station Node B increases and a measured interference volume (for example, a measured noise rise) in the uplink exceeds an allowable value (for example, a maximum allowable noise rise) , the radio base station Node B lowers the maximum allowable transmission rate so that the interference volume in the uplink can be within a range of the allowable value (see, FIG. 3).<br>
On the other hand, when the interference volume (for<br><br>
example, the noise rise) in the uplink is within a range of the allowable value (for example, the maximum allowable noise rise) , thereby having a space, at the time of completion of user data transmission in the mobile station UE connected to the cell under the control of the radio base station Node B, or the like, the radio base station Node B again increases the maximum allowable transmission rate (see, FIG. 3).<br>
The conventional mobile communication system is configured so that a maximum allowable transmission rate can be transmitted by an "Absolute Grant Channel (AGCH)", but not be transmitted during all the Transmission Time Intervals (TTI) when a value of the maximum allowable transmission rate is not changed.<br>
In other words, the conventional mobilr communication sysrem can suppress increase of downlink power resources by transmitting an Absolute Grant Channel (AGCH) only when the value of the maximum allowable transmission rate is changed. However, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been a problem that increase of the transmission rate of user data in the uplink can not be started since a mobile station UE which is newly connected to a specific cell is not informed of an effective maximum allowable transmission rate at that time (that is, the last maximum allowable transmission rate transmitted before the mobile station UE is connected to the specific cell).<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
(Configuration of Mobile Communication System According to<br>
First Embodiment of the Present Invention)<br>
Referring to FIGs. 4 to 11, a configuration of a mobile communication system according to a firs* embodiment of the presen" invention will be described.<br>
It should be noted that, as shown in FIG. 1, the mobile communication system according to this embodiment is provided with a plurality of radio base stations Node B #1 to Node B #5 and a radio network controller RNC.<br>
The mobile communication system according to this embodiment is configured to control a transmission rate of user data that is transmitted by a mobile station UE via an uplink.<br>
In addition, in the mobile communication system according to this embodiment, a "High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) " is used in a downlink, and an "Enhanced Uplink (EUL)" is used in an uplink.<br>
It should be noted that in both of the HSDPA and the EUL, retransmission control (N process stop and wait) shall be<br><br>
performed by a "Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)".<br>
Therefore, in an uplink, an "Enhanced Dedicated Physical Channel (E-DPCH) " configured of an "Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH)" and an "Enhanced Dedicated Physical Control Channel (E-DPCCH)", and a "Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH)" configured of a "Dedicated Physical Date Channel (DPDCH) " and a "Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH) " are used.<br>
Here, the E-DPCCH transmits control data for the EUL such as a transmission format number for defining a transmission format (transmission block size, or the like) of the EDPDCH, HARQ related information (the number of retransmission, or the like) , and scheduling related information (transmission power, buffer residence-volume, or the like in the mobile station UE) .<br>
In addition, the E-DPDCH is paired with the S-DPCCK, and transmits user data for the mobile station UE based on the control data for the EUL transmitted through the E-DPCCH.<br>
The DPCCH transmits control data such as a pilot symbol that is used for RAKE combining, SIR measurement, or the like, a Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) for identifying a transmission format of uplink DPDCH, and a downlink power control bit in a downlink.<br>
In addition, the DPDCH is paired with the DPCCH, and transmits user data for the mobile station UE based on the control data transmitted through the DPCCH. However, if user data that should be transmitted does not exist in the mobile station UE, the DPDCH can be configured not to be transmitted.<br>
In addition, in the uplink, a "High Speed Dedicated Physical Control Channel (HS-DPCCH)" and a "Random Access<br><br>
Channel (RACH)", which are needed when the HSPDA is applied, are also used.<br>
The HS-DPCCH transmits a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) in a downlink and an acknowledge signal (Ack or Nack) for the HS-DPCCH.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the mobile station UE according to this embodiment is provided with a bus interface 31, a call processing section 32 , a baseband processing section 33 , a radio frequency (RF) section 34, and a transmission - reception antenna 35.<br>

The RLC processing section 33a is configured to transmit, to the MAC-d processing section 33b, the user data transmitted from the call processing section 32 by performing a processing (RLC processing) in an upper layer of a layer-2 against the user data.<br><br>
The MAC-d processing section 33b is configured to grant a channel identifier header, and to create a transmission format in the uplink based on the limitation of transmission power.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the MAC-e processing section 33c is provided with an Enhanced Transport Format Combination (E-TFC) selecting section 33cl and an HARQ processing section 33c2.<br>
The E-TFC selecting section 33cl is configured to determine a transmission format (E-TFC) of the E-DPDCH and the E-DPCCH, based on scheduling signals transmitted from the radio base station Node B.<br>
In addition, the E-TFC selecting section 33cl is configured to transmit transmission format information on the determined transmission format (that is, a transmission data block size, an transmission power ratio between the E-DPDCH ana rhe DPCCH, or the like) to the layer-1 processing section 33d, and also to transmir the determined transmission data block size or the transmission power ratio to the HARQ processing section 33c2.<br>
Here, the scheduling signals include the maximum allowable transmission rate of user data in the mobile station UE (for example, the block size of maximum allowable transmission data, a maximum value of the transmission power ratio between the E-DPDCH and the DPCCH (maximum allowable transmission power ratio) , or the like) , or a parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate.<br>
Unless particularly described in this specification, the maximum allowable transmission rate includes a parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate.<br>

The HARQ processing section 33c2 is configured to perform process control for the "stop-and-wait of N-process", so as to transmit the user data in the uplink based on an acknowledge signal (Ack/Nack for uplink data) transmitted from the radio base station Node B.<br>
Specifically, the HARQ processing section 3 3c2 is configured to determine whether or not the receive processing of downlink user data has been successful based on the result of the "Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)" entered from the first layer processing section 33d.<br>
Then, the HARQ processing section 33c2 is configured to generate an acknowledge signal (Ack/Nack for downlink user data) based on the determined result, so as to transmit the acknowledge signal to the layer-1 processing section 33d.<br>
In addition, the HARQ processing section 33c2 is configured to transmit, to the MAC-d processing 33b, the downlink user data entered from the layer-1 processing section 33d when the above-described determination result has been successful.<br>
