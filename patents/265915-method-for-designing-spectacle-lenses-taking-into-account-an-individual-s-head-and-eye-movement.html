METHOD FOR DESIGNING SPECTACLE LENSES TAKING INTO ACCOUNT<br>
                        AN INDIVIDUAL'S HEAD AND EYE MOVEMENT<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for designing ophthalmic lenses. In<br>
particular, the invention provides a method for designing spectacle lenses by taking<br>
into account the head and eye movement of an individual. The invention also<br>
provides a method for designing a lens customized to an individual.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
For example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses ('TALs"), are<br>
used for the treatment of presbyopia. The progressive surface of a PAL provides far,<br>
intermediate, and near vision in a gradual, continuous progression of increasing<br>
dioptric power from far to near focus.<br>
Any number of methods for designing spectacle lenses are known.<br>
Typically, these methods involve one or more of benchmarking of known designs,<br>
developing theoretical target values for control optical parameters, obtaining<br>
subjective patient feedback, and using objective testing methods to produce a lens<br>
design. One disadvantage of these design methods is that they do not correlate the<br>
patient feedback and objective testing to precise locations on the lens. Thus, the<br>
point at which an individual's line-of-sight actually intersects with the lens' surface<br>
while the individual is performing a given task frequently differs from that<br>
calculated by the lens designer. This results in the lens wearer, especially the PAL<br>
wearer having to move the eye and head to maintain adequate visual resolution<br>
through the lens.<br>
Additionally, it is known that certain parameters control optimal visual<br>
comfort for the lens wearer. These parameters include, without limitation, clarity of<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>
2<br>
vision, comfort over sustained periods of use, ease of changing focus, and the<br>
amount of head and eye movement required by the lens wearer. Conventional<br>
design methods do not account for these parameters with any precision and provide<br>
    little to no guidance for design optimization processes requiring definition of merit<br>
functions incorporating one or more of these parameters. Therefore, a method for<br>
designing lenses that overcomes these disadvantages is needed.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
              Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a head and eye movement apparatus of<br>
the invention.<br>
Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
In the present invention, a method for designing ophthalmic lenses, including<br>
progressive addition lenses, and lenses produced by the method are provided. The<br>
method of the invention permits the direct correlation of an individual's subjective<br>
assessment of the lens' performance and the objective measure of lens performance<br>
relative to the individual. The method permits generation of lens designs based on<br>
the head and eye movement of the individual and the designing of customized<br>
lenses.<br>
Conventional lens design methods do not permit controlling optical<br>
parameters to be designed with any precision. For example, for PALs, controlling<br>
parameters include, without limitation, distance vision width, intermediate vision or<br>
channel width, near vision width, channel length, magnitude of maximum unwanted<br>
astigmatism, power gradient, and distance of the maximum unwanted astigmatism<br>
from the optical center of the design. For single vision lenses, controlling<br>
parameters are radius of contour of the spherical power that is less than or equal to<br>
0.25 diopters of the nominal sphere power, radius of the contour of unwanted<br>
astigmatism which astigmatism is less than or equal to 0.25 diopters, and radius of<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>
3<br>
contour of the visual acuity that is less than -0.2 units from the target value at the<br>
lens' optical center.<br>
              In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for designing a<br>
spectacle lens, comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of a.) providing<br>
a first lens having a first design; b.) identifying at least one point of regard for the<br>
first lens; c.) obtaining information regarding the lens' performance using the at least<br>
one point of regard; and d.) modifying the first design using the information<br>
    obtained in step c.) to provide a second lens having a second design.<br>
For purposes of the invention, by '*point of regard" or 'TOR" is meant a<br>
point on the front, or object side, surface of the lens at which the individual's visual<br>
axis intersects with the lens. By "visual axis" is meant the line of sight, passing<br>
    through the eye's nodal points, between a viewed object and the observer's fovea.<br>
Nodal points are theoretical pairs of points in an optical system, such as the eye, for<br>
which, if an off-axis ray is directed at one point of the pair, the ray will leave the<br>
system with the same direction as the off-axis ray and appear to emanate from the<br>
other nodal point of the pair.<br>
The invention may be used to design single vision or multifocal spectacle<br>
lenses, but may find its greatest utility in the design of progressive addition lenses.<br>
By "progressive addition lens" or "progressive lens" is meant a lens that has at least<br>
one progressive addition surface. By "progressive addition surface" or "progressive<br>
surface" is meant a continuous, aspheric surface having far and near vision zones<br>
only, intermediate and near vision zones only, or far, near and intermediate vision<br>
zones wherein the intermediate zone is a zone of increasing or decreasing dioptric<br>
power connecting the far and near vision zones.<br>
In the first step of the method of the method of the invention, a first lens is<br>
provided by any conventionally available method. The lens may be designed using<br><br>
WO 2(106/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>
4<br>
commercially available software including, without limitation, ZEMAX™, CODE<br>
V™, OSLO™, and the like. Typically, the lens will be designed by describing each<br>
surface of the lens. For example, the progressive surface or surfaces of the lens may<br>
    be described, or represented, as continuous, differentially continuous, or twice<br>
differentially continuous. The shape that the described surface may take is limited<br>
only by the density of the elements or coefficients used to describe the surface.<br>
Preferably, the first lens is a lens in which both the front, or object side, and the .<br>
back, or eye side, surface are progressive surfaces.<br>
Once the designing of the first lens is complete, a lens according to the first<br>
design is produced by any convenient method. Methods for producing such lenses<br>
include, without limitation, machining of a glass or polymeric article such as a semi-<br>
finished blank, molding, such as by injection or cast molding, or a combination of<br>
    machining and molding.<br>
In the second step of the invention, the lens is used to identify at least one,<br>
and preferably a plurality, of points of regard for an individual or a plurality of<br>
individuals. Identification of one or more points of regard for a population of<br>
individuals permits determination of an average location for each point of regard.<br>
The designer may use the POR information to identify the areas of the lens that are<br>
being used for the performance of a task. Preferably, it is desirable to match the<br>
overall profile of the lens to the POR by either placing prism reference point, or<br>
preferably the fitting point, at the center of the distance POR. For progressive<br>
addition lenses, the center of the near zone is placed at the center of the near POR,<br>
which determines channel length and inset of the lens. Alternatively and preferably,<br>
the optical center may be located at the POR for a particular individual. Preferably,<br>
a plurality of PORs are mapped while objects are viewed by the individual at at least<br>
two distances. More preferably, the mapping is carried out while objects are viewed<br>
at distant, near, and intermediate locations.<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>
5<br>
By "distant location" is meant a location at a distance greater than about 80<br>
cm from the eye. By "intermediate location" is meant a location at a distance about<br>
    45 to about 80 cm from the eye. By "near location" is meant a location at a distance<br>
about 5 to about 45 cm from the eye.<br>
In the method of the invention, the points of regard may be measured using<br>
commercially available head and eye movement measurement devices that are<br>
    modified. Any suitable commercially available eye movement device may be used<br>
and modified including, without limitation, ISCAN™, ETL-400, RK-726 PCT and<br>
the like. Suitable commercially available head movement devices that may be used<br>
and modified include, without limitation, Polhemus INSHDETRAK™, Ascension<br>
Magnetic Head Tracking System, and the like. Typically, eye and head movement<br>
    measuring devices suitable for use in the method of the invention include a head<br>
mounted recording device, eye and scene imaging device, and a computer.<br>
For use in the invention, the commercially available systems are modified to<br>
provide one or more scene cameras that point towards the lens wearer's spectacle<br>
     lens. The scene camera may be any commercially available small CCD device such<br>
as an Elmo MN30 LIPSTICK™ camera.<br>
Additionally, the calibration techniques for the head and eye movement -<br>
system must be modified to permit calibration for the POR to the eye movements.<br>
Modification of the calibration may be carried out in any convenient manner. In one<br>
method of calibration, the cameras are adjusted to produce an infrared image that<br>
has no shadows or reflections and the pupil and corneal reflex contrast are adjusted.<br>
The individual's eye movements are calibrated by initiating eye movement device's<br>
calibration routine and by having the individual fixate on each of five points on a<br>
fixed target while the software automatically notes the horizontal (x) and vertical (y)<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>
6<br>
pixel location values for the corneal reflex, or image of the light source as reflected<br>
from the corneal surface, and the center of the pupil that correspond<br>
to known eye movements. The known eye movements are determined by having the<br>
    individual look at fixation points for which the exact position is known. Typically, a<br>
central point and four points that are, respectively, 5 degrees up, down, left and right<br>
of the central point are used. These values will be used by the software to translate<br>
the pixel location of the pupil and corneal reflex to degrees of gaze.<br>
To calibrate the POR, an occluder is used. The occluder may be made of any<br>
convenient material as, for example, a piece of No. 88A Kodak Wratten gelatin filter<br>
with a pattern of five pinholes. The size and placement of the pinholes is not critical<br>
provided that their positions are known. Pinholes of 0.6 mm in a 5 by 5 mm square<br>
arrangment with a central pinhole placed at the fitting point may be conveniently<br>
    used. The occluder is placed on the single vision or progressive addition lens with<br>
the central hole of the occluder located at the optical center of the lens, or the prism<br>
reference point. The individual fixates on a small LED screen through each of the<br>
pinholes. The sequence of fixation is not critical, but using center, upper left, upper<br>
right, lower left and-lower right may be convenient.  The x, y pixel values for the<br>
    location of each hole is recorded by an observer from the positions displayed on the<br>
screen and the angular gaze position at each hole sighting is recorded by the devices<br>
software to correlate the gaze position with the POR. Optionally, a third board may<br>
be included to capture the frame and cap position in relation to the eye to permit<br>
compensation for either or both frame and cap movement.<br>
Figure 1 depicts one embodiment of the devices useful in practicing the<br>
invention. As shown, a Polhemus 1NSIDETRAK head movement sensor 12 is<br>
placed on the individual's head and the spectacle lens 13 is placed at the appropriate<br>
position in front of the individual's eye. Attached to the front of sensor 12 is a scene<br>
camera 14 and an eye camera 16. A beam splitter 11 is positioned so that it<br>
transmits visible light and reflects infrared light. Any convenient beam splitter may<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>

be used as, for example, a dichroic hot mirror. An occluder 19 is shown on the front<br>
surface of lens 13. An infrared light source 15 provides the illumination for the<br>
system. Suitable IR light sources are known and include, without limitation, a light<br>
    emitting diode with a peak of approximately 850 nm. Images from the scene and<br>
eye camera are transmitted to scene and eye monitors 17 and 18, respectively. A<br>
personal computer 20 is used, which computer is loaded with the appropriate<br>
hardware and software. For example, Polhemus INSIDETRAK software with an<br>
ISCAN RK-620-PC calibrator card and ISCAN RK-464-PC capture card.<br>
The software used in the method of the invention is analysis and graphical<br>
software for example ISCAN'S DAQ™. The software defines scene elements, or<br>
pixels, and correlates the pixels with the eye's fixations and, thus, eye movement<br>
recorded by the eye movement camera. Eye movements are represented by cursor<br>
    movement on a suitable monitor which monitor may be, without limitation, a Sony<br>
SSM930™ monitor or the like. This provides a visual track of the individual's<br>
occulomotor path with the lens in place. The system uses the center of the entrance<br>
pupil of the eye/spectacle lens optical system to track the eye movement.<br>
              Each point of regard is analyzed using conventional methods including,<br>
without limitation, MATLAB™, MATHCAD™, EXCEL™, QUATTRO™,<br>
ORIGIN™, SPSS™ and the like. For example, the point of regard at which the<br>
individual's head must move to maintain the eye's access to the intermediate vision<br>
zone of a progressive lens may be identified.<br>
In one embodiment, a point of regard is identified at a particular distance and<br>
then one or more controlling optical parameters of the point are characterized.<br>
Alternatively, the points of regard for various distances may be identified during the<br>
performance of tasks requiring the eye to view objects at various distances. This<br>
permits determination of the widths of the various viewing zones used by the<br>
midvidual.<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>

A two-dimensional POR plot may be made. For example, ISCAN may store<br>
the parameters, listed below on Table 1, including the horizontal and vertical POR<br>
values in a text file. The text file is then imported into and sorted in EXCEL. After<br>
converting the POR pixel values to positions on the lens by using the values<br>
obtained during the calibration step, the horizontal and vertical POR data can be<br>
exported to ORIGIN, SPSS or the like for statistical analysis and plotting.<br>

In the fourth step of the method of the invention the first lens design is<br>
modified by using the information obtained to design a second lens having a second<br>
design. When multiple points of regard are identified for a progressive addition<br>
lens, widths of various viewing zones actually used may be compared with the<br>
delimitations of the widths of the vision zones of the lens. This is done by<br>
identifying the maximum unwanted astigmatism, or maximum astigmatism<br>
introduced or caused by one or more of the lens' surfaces, and spherical defocus that<br>
trigger eye and head movement, which information maybe used to adjust the width<br><br>

of the various viewing zones of the lens being designed accordingly. Additionally,<br>
the near vision zone inset angle, channel length and location, distribution and axis of<br>
unwanted astigmatism, prism profile, binocular design features, asphericity, and<br>
    aberration correction may be modified according to the individual's requirements or<br>
from the average values from sample individuals.<br>
Modification may be carried out by any convenient method, which methods<br>
are known in the art. For example, suitable optical design algorithms and software<br>
    may be used to carry out the modification of a merit function or cost function<br>
constructed to provide a global measure of an optical property. A merit function<br>
may be used to describe the sum of unwanted astigmatism values at selected points<br>
on the surface of the lens. In constructing a merit function, a list of weights is used<br>
to provide a desired weight to each area of area element of the optic. Modification<br>
    of this list of weights or a function describing the weights as a function of x, y<br>
coordinates may then be carried out. Additionally, ray tracing software, or a<br>
comparable tool, is used to analyze the image quality provided by the surface and, if<br>
necessary, to further modify the weight or function.<br>
The invention may be used to design lenses based on average POR values<br>
derived from measurements taken from a statistically significant number of<br>
individuals. Alternatively and preferably, the invention may be used to study the<br>
head and eye movements of an individual and directly use the information gathered<br>
to design a lens customized to the individual's viewing habits.<br>
The invention will be further clarified by the following, non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
Example<br>
For each of the subjects, two-dimensional recordings of point of regard, eye<br>
movements and head movements were compared for single vision and PAL lenses<br>
while subjects carried out three visual tasks. The lenses used were SOLA VIP™ and<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>
10<br>
SILOR SUPER NO-LINE™ progressive addition lenses. The optical center of each<br>
of the lenses to be tested was determined and marked in the conventional manner at<br>
the fitting cross. A gel-filter (Kodak Wratten No. 87C) with five 0.6 mm apertures<br>
    arranged as center, upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right was centered<br>
and attached to the front of the lenses that was on the left eye. The central aperture<br>
was positioned at the lens' fitting cross, or the point on the lens centered on the<br>
pupil. The filter blocked visible light and allowed infra-red light to be transmitted so<br>
that head and eye movements were recorded. The individual's other eye was<br>
    occluded during calibration but not occluded during measurement.<br>
The subject fixated on a target through the central aperture of the filter and<br>
the fixation point pixel values were input into a computer. By rotating the subject's<br>
head, the subject fixated the same target through each of the four remaining<br>
    apertures and the fixation point values were captured by the ISCAN programs's<br>
POR calibration routine. The software utilized the eye movement calibration to<br>
translate the video image of the eye horizontal and vertical eye position in degrees.<br>
The POR calibration then correlated those values with the position on the lens that<br>
the eye is looking through (POR). The software then recorded both the eye<br>
    movement and the POR.<br>
Each subject fixated for 15 to 20 seconds on a letter along the midline at<br>
distances of 325,64 and 40 cm from the eye. Additionally, each subject read a 30<br>
degrees wide text at a 17 degree angle at 64 cm. Still further, each subject<br>
maintained their head fixed while shifting their gaze horizontally left and right until<br>
the letter appeared blurred through the lens at 64 and 325 cm.<br>
Three subjects with vision that was 20/25 or better with no pathology or<br>
binocular dysfunction were used. Each sat with the eye and head movement devices<br>
in place while the left eye was measured under binocular conditions. Each subject<br>
wore each of the three lenses set forth on Table 2, which lenses fully corrected for<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>

the subjects' refractive error. The results. Table 2 shows the data for the three<br>
subjects' preferred distance and near POR relative to the fitting point and the<br>
calculated eye path length for single vision lenses. The data suggest that the channel<br>
length provided in progressive addition lenses, typically 15 mm or more, is longer<br>
than that preferred by subjects when performing tasks with single vision lenses.<br>
Table 2<br>

Distance POR	0mm	+2 mm	-4 mm<br>
Near POR	-7 mm	-6 mm	-11 mm<br>
CalculatedChannel Length(Distance — NearPOR)	7mm	8 mm	7mm<br>
In Table 2, a positive value means that the POR was above the expected location.<br>
In Table 3 is summarized the POR findings for the intermediate zone for two<br>
different tasks and as determined from bench measurement of the test lenses. The<br>
data suggests that, compared to single vision leases, progressive addition lenses<br>
limit the desired zone width at intermediate distances, that different tasks result in<br>
different effective widths and that the definitional criteria used for the intermediate<br>
zone width for progressive addition lenses is not in agreement with that derived from<br>
the subject data.<br><br>
WO 2006/054985                                                                                              PCT/US2004/038435<br>

Additional testing of one brand of progressive addition lenses, as shown by<br>
Table 4, determined that the POR for distance, intermediate and near tasks did not<br>
coincide with the expected or defined locations (i.e., fitting cross for distance, one-<br>
half the distance between the distance fitting cross and near reference circle for<br>
intermediate zone and near reference circle for near). These findings suggest that<br>
subjects may not be willing to completely alter their viewing preferences to<br>
accommodate the optical design characteristics present in progressive addition<br>
lenses.<br>
