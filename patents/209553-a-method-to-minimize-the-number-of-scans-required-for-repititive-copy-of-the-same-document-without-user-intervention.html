*FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to Copier, Multi function devices/peripherals with copy function and proposes a method to minimize the number of scans required for repetitive copy of the same document without user intervention. More particularly this invention relates to a method to minimize the number of scans required for repetitive copy of the same document without user intervention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently, devices available in market support feature to request multiple copies in a single operation and to reprint the last printed page (mostly applicable for printers).<br>
1.	In case of "multiple copies" feature available in printers and copiers, user has to specify the number of copies required before the copy operation begins. On doing so, the document will be scanned only ones for multiple copies.<br>
2.	In case of "reprint last printed page" feature which is available in printers, user has to press a separate key so that the printer will print the last printed page from its memory.<br>
There are following drawbacks in the prior arts:<br>
1.	In case of feature of requesting multiple copies, user has to specify the number of copies required before the copy operation begins. In this case, the document will be scanned only one time. But immediately after the copy operation ends, if the user once again initiates one more copy operation for the same document, then the device will scan the document one more time. For single page documents, the proposed invention tries to avoid the subsequent scans required for repetitive copy of the same document without user intervention.<br>
2.	In case of "reprint last printed page" feature which is available in printers, user has to press a separate key. But in the present invention, targeted at<br><br>
the copiers, the user would not have to press separate key to print the previously copied document and the user can use the same copy key to request another copy of the same document copied in the immediate past.<br>
The US Patent No. 4,958,232 titled "Process Apparatus for Processing Memory which Stores Information" describes a copying apparatus, which comprises an exposing unit for exposing an original document, a memory, a circuit for causing plurality of images to be stored in the memory, a circuit to read out from the memory and a printing unit to print read out images. The patent describes a copier that can be used to get repetitive copies of the previously scanned documents. The disclosed invention provides an apparatus capable of storing the exposed documents in memory, and enables the user to get specified number of copies of a selected document(s) as and when required. However, the user needs to specify in advance if he/she wants to store the scanned document in the device memory. In addition, the user needs to use a panel provided on the apparatus to get the selected documents reprinted. The same copy key cannot be used to get a copy of the last scanned page.<br>
In another prior art the Toshiba e-studio 160 is a Multi Function Peripheral (MFP), which offers various functions to the users. One of the functions provided includes repetitive copying. A user needs to store a copy of the scanned document in the device memory, in order to retrieve the copy as and when required. Even after completion of the first copy operation, a user can recall the document from the device memory and get a copy of the document re-printed with the help of an interactive panel display.<br>
The features provided by this product enable a user to get a copy of the last exposed document without re-exposing it. The device stores an electronic copy of the last exposed document in device memory. However, the electronic copy is not stored automatically in the device memory, and the user has to specify the same. The user can get a copy of the document re-printed by following the instructions<br><br>
on the interactive panel display on the MFP. However, the use of the same copy key to get a copy of the last scanned page is not possible.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to minimize the number of scans required for repetitive copy of the same document without user intervention. The method enables the device to predict whether to go in for a new scan or not.<br>
The present invention proposes a method to minimize the number of scans required for repetitive copy of the same document. The said method is applicable for the documents copied from both the flat bed scanner and automatic document feeders. But, the method considers only single page documents. In accordance with the invention, an electronic copy of the last scanned document is automatically stored in the device memory without being specified by a user. Even after the initial copy operation has been completed, the electronic copy of the last scanned document remains in the device memory. Hence, the initiation of one more copy operation by the user for the same document does not require scanning the document again, provided no other scanning operation has been performed after the initial copy operation of the same document. Additionally, the user can get a copy of the previously copied document by pressing the same copy key again. Thus, the user does not need to use a separate key to get a copy of the last printed document.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention explains a method to minimize the number of scans required for repetitive copy of the same document without user intervention comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	checking the availability of paper in the automatic document<br>
feeder;<br>
b.	checking whether the flat bed scanner is opened;<br>
c.	checking whether the previous scan data stored in a copy<br>
memory was overwritten by another data;<br><br>
d.	automatically storing the scan data of the last copied document<br>
in the copy memory after each copy operation without being<br>
specified by a user; and<br>
e.	using the stored scan data for copying if the said checks gives a<br>
negative result,<br>
wherein the user gets a copy of the previously copied document by pressing the same copy key again.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 describes the method to minimize the number of scans.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Referring to the diagram, the method described in this present invention is shown generally as 100. The method 100 has to/can be implemented on copiers and multi functional peripherals supporting copy functions.<br><br>
In the present invention, number of scans will be minimized for repetitive copy of the same document by following the below mentioned process and that is generally shown in Figure 1 as 100. After each copy operation in the device, the device maintains the recently scanned data in the copy memory, the method 100 dictates when the previously scanned data should be used.<br>
At 101, whenever user presses the copy button, the device control moves to 102, where the device checks whether there is any document present in the automatic document feeder.<br>
If there is any paper present in the automatic document feeder, then the device moves to 103 and starts copying the document as usual. If there is no paper present in the automatic document feeder, then the device moves to 104 and checks whether the flat bed scanner's cover is opened after the recently completed copy operation.<br>
If the flat bed scanner's cover is opened, then there is a probability that the document would have been replaced by some other new document. So for the current copy request, the new document has to be scanned instead of using the stored scan data. To accomplish that, the device moves to 105 by continuing with the existing method of copying the document. If the flat bed scanner cover was not opened after the recently completed copy operation, then user requests to copy the same document that he/she requested before. For this, as the previous scan data is stored in the copy memory, there is no need to scan the document one more time.<br>
After 105, if the flat bed scanner cover is not opened after the recently completed copy operation, in devices where the copy memory is shared for other purpose, is has to be checked whether the scan data stored in the copy memory was overwritten by any other and so the device control moves to 106. If the scan data was overwritten by others, then the device control moves to 107 to continue with<br><br>
the existing method of scanning and then copying the document. If the scan data was not overwritten by others, then the device control moves to 108 to print the scan data (scanned for the previous copy operation) directly from the copy memory instead of scanning once again. This way of using the stored scan memory continues until there is a paper/document present in automatic document feeder or the flat bed scanner cover is opened or the stored scan data in the copy memory is overwritten by the others.<br>
The method targets only single page documents. As in multi page documents, it is not possible to demarcate between end of one document with the start another document submitted for the continuous copy operation without the user intervention.<br>
Alternatives<br>
The modifications / alternatives that can be made to the present inventions are the following:<br>
1.	If the device doesn't have an automatic document feeder, then the steps 102 and 103 can be omitted.<br>
2.	If the device doesn't use the copy memory for some other purpose, then the steps 106 and 107 can be omitted.<br>
3.	If the device doesn't have flat bed scanner, then the steps 104 and 105 can be omitted.<br>
4.	Separate key/option in the device can be provided to enable/disable this feature, if user considers that this method violates security / privacy (as it remembers the recently copy document).<br>
5.	This method can also be selectively implemented for the documents that are copied from flat bed alone or automatic document feeder alone, provided that there is an additional step (at the completion of each copy operation) to clear the scan data from the copy memory, for documents scanned from flat bed and the method is implemented only for automatic document feeder or for documents scanned from automatic<br><br>
document feeder and the method is implemented only for flat bed. It can be made possible to do selection dynamically instead of as factory set selection.<br>
