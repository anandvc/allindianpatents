				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION -<br>
The present invention relates to mixed suftaotant systems useful in laundry and cleaning compositions, especially granular and liquid detergent compositions, comprising mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants, alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants and cationic surfactants within select relative proportions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional detersive surfactants comprise molecules having a water-solubilizing substituent (hydrophilic group) and an oleophilic substituent (hydrophobic group). Such surfactants typically comprise hydrophilic groups such as carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, amine oxide, polyoxyethylene, and the like, attached to an alkyl, alkenyl or alkaryl hydrophobe usually containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Accordingly, the manufacturer of such surfactants must have access to a source of hydrophobe groups to which the desired hydrophile can be attached by chemical means. The earliest source of hydrophobe groups comprised the natural fats and oils, which were converted into soaps (i.e., carboxylate hydrophile) by saponiflcation with base. Coconut oil and palm oil are still used to manufacture soap, as well as to manufacture the alkyl sulfate ("AS") class of surfactants. Other hydrophobes are available from petrochemicals, including alkylated benzene which is used to manufacture alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants ("LAS").<br>
More recently, it has been discovered that certain relatively long-chain alkyl sulfate compositions containing mid-chain branching are preferred for use in laundry products, especially under cool or cold water washing conditions (e.g., 20°C-5°C). These mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants, which provide a surfactant mixture that is higher in surfactancy and has better low temperature water solubility than linear alkyl sulfate, can be suitably combined with one or more other traditional detergent surfactants (e.g., other primary alkyl sulfates; linear alkyl benzene sulfonates; alkyl ethoxylated sulfates; nonionic surfactants; etc.) to provide improved surfactant systems. However, it has been determined that such surfactant systems containing higher levels of linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (higher than about 20% by weight of the mixture of alkyl benzene sulfonate and mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate) are not optimized in cleaning performance.<br>
It has been surprisingly determined that cleaning performance of surfactant systems comprising these mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants<br>
having greater than 14.5 carbon atoms in combination with higher levels of linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant can be further improved by including low levels of cationic surfactant in these surfactant systems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to surfactant mixtures comprising mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactants, linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants and cationic surfactants, and to cleaning compositions containing these surfactant systems. For purposes of this invention, it is to be recognized that other surfactants may optionally be present in the surfactant system according to the present invention, such as nonionic surfactants (e.g., alkyl ethoxylates) and other anionic surfactants (e.g., linear alkyl sulfates). Such optional surfactants are described in more detail herein after. However, for purposes of calculating the relative amounts of the essential components of the present surfactant system mixtures, only the weight of these essential components in the surfactant system are considered.<br>
Thus, the anionic cosurfactant mixture of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates and linear alkyl benzene sulfonates comprises from about 80% to about 99% (most preferably from about 92% to about 98%) by weight of the total weight of these essential surfactants plus the essential cationic surfactant. (Any optional surfactants present are not included in this total weight.) The essential cationic surfactant therefore comprises from about 1% to about 20% (most preferably from about 2% to about 8%) by weight of the total weight of the essential surfactants.<br>
Further, the essential anionic surfactants are combined in select proportions relative to each other. Relative to the total weight of only the essential mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate and the linear alkyl benzene sulfonate, the mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate is present in the present invention compositions from about 35% to about 80%. The linear alkyl benzene sulfonate is present from about 20% to about 65% by weight of the total weight of the essential anionic surfactants. Mid-chain Branched Alkyl Sulfate:<br>
The branched surfactant compositions comprise one or more, preferably two or more, mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkyl sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 18. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 18.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon primary alkyl sulfate surfactant having 13 carbon atoms in the backbone must have 1, 2, or 3 branching units (i.e., R, R1 and/or R2) whereby total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is at least 16. In this example, the C16 total carbon requirement may be satisfied equally by having, for example, one propyl branching unit or three methyl branching units.<br>
R, R1, and R.2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C1-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R1, and R2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 17 at least R or R1 is not hydrogen,<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R.1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkyl sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol may comprise some amount of the present invention compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol used to prepare the alkyl sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant according to the present invention.<br>
M is hydrogen or a salt forming cation depending upon the method of synthesis. Examples of salt forming cations are lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, quaternary alkyl amines having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3, R.4, R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen, C1-C22 alkylene, C4-C22 branched alkylene, C1-C6 alkanol, C1-C22 alkenylene, C4-C22 branched alkenylene, and mixtures thereof. Preferred cations are ammonium (R3, R4, R5 and R6 equal hydrogen), sodium, potassium, mono-, di-, and trialkanol ammonium, and mixtures thereof. The monoalkanol ammonium compounds of the present invention have R3 equal to C1-C6 alkanol, R4, R5 and R6 equal to hydrogen; dialkanol ammonium compounds of the present invention have R3 and R4 equal to C1-C6 alkanol, R5 and R6 equal to hydrogen; trialkanol ammonium compounds of the present invention have R3, R4 and R5 equal to C1-C6 alkanol, R6 equal to hydrogen. Preferred alkanol ammonium salts of the present invention are the mono-, di- and tri- quaternary ammonium compounds having the formulas: H3N+CH2CH2OH, H2N+(CH2CH20H)2, HN+(CH2CH20H)3. Preferred M is sodium, potassium and the C2 alkanol ammonium salts listed above; most preferred is sodium.<br>
Further regarding the above formula, w is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer of at least 1; and w + x + y + zisan integer from 8 to 14.<br>
Certain points of branching (i.e., the location along the chain of the R, R*, and/or R2 moieties in the above formula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl substituted linear alkyl sulfates of the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It should be noted that for the mono-methyl substituted surfactants these ranges exclude the two terminal carbon atoms of the chain and the two carbon atoms immediately adjacent to the sulfate group. For surfactant mixtures comprising two or more of R, R1, or R.2, alkyl branching at the 2-carbon atom is within the scope of the present invention. Surfactants having chains longer than ethyl (i.e. C3 alkyl substitutents) on the 2-carbon atom, however, are less preferred.<br>
The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, preferred mid-I     chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for di-methyl substituted linear alkyl sulfates of the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
When di-alkyl substituted primary alkyl sulfates are combined with mono-substituted mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates, the di-alkyl substituted primary alkyl sulfates having one methyl substitution on the 2-carbon position and another methyl substitution in the preferred range as indicated above, are within the present invention.<br>
The preferred surfactant mixtures of the present invention have at least 0.001%, more preferably at least 5%, most preferably at least 20% by weight, of the mixture one or more branched primary alkyl sulfates having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the total number of carbon atoms, including branching, is from 15 to 18, and wherein further for this surfactant mixture the average total number of carbon atoms in the branched primary alkyl moieties having the above formula is within the<br>
range of greater than 14.5 to about IS; R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl; M is a water soluble cation; x is from 0 to 11; y is from 0 to 11; z is at least 2; and x + y + z is from 9 to 13; provided R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen. More preferred are compositions having at least 5% of the mixture comprising one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates wherein x + y is equal to 9 and z is at least 2.<br>
Preferably, the mixtures of surfactant comprise at least 5% of a mid chain branched primary alkyl sulfate having R1 and R2 independently hydrogen, methyl, provided R! and R2 are not both hydrogen; x + y is equal to 8, 9, or 10 and z is at least 2. More preferably the mixtures of surfactant comprise at least 20% of a mid chain branched primary alkyl sulfate having R! and R2 independently hydrogen, methyl, provided R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen; x + y is equal to 8,9, or 10 and z is at least 2.<br>
Preferred detergent compositions according to the present invention, for example one useful for laundering fabrics, comprise from about 0.001% to about 99% of a mixture of mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants, said mixture comprising at least about 5 % by weight of two or more mid-chain branched alkyl sulfates having the formula:<br>

Preparation of Mid-chain Branched Alkvl Sulfates<br>
The following reaction scheme outlines a general approach to the preparation of mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates of the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
An alkyl halide is converted to a Grignard reagent and the Grignard is reacted with a haloketone. After conventional acid hydrolysis, acetylation and thermal elimination of acetic acid, an intermediate olefm is produced (not shown in the scheme) which is hydrogenated forthwith using any convenient hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C.<br>
This route is favorable over others in that the branch, in this illustration a 5-methyl branch, is introduced early in the reaction sequence.<br>
Formylation of the alkyl halide resulting from the first hydrogenation step yields alcohol product, as shown in the scheme. This can be sulfated using any convenient sulfating agent, e.g., chlorosulfonic acid, S03/air, or oleum, to yield the final branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant. There is flexibility to extend the branching one additional carbon beyond that which is achieved by a single formylation. Such extension can, for example, be accomplished by reaction with ethylene oxide. See "Grignard Reactions of Nonmetailic Substances", M.S. Kharasch and O. Reinmuth, Prentice-Hall, N.Y,, 1954; J, Org. Chem., J. Cason and W. R. Winans, Vol. 15 (1950), pp 139-147; J. Org Chem., J. Cason et al., Vol. 13 (1948), pp 239-248; J. Org Chem., J. Cason et al., Vol. 14 (1949), pp 147-154; and<br>
J. Org Chem., L Cason et al., Vol. 15 (1950), pp 135- 138 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In variations of the above procedure, alternate haloketones or Grignard reagents may be used. PBr3 halogenation of the alcohol from formylation or ethoxylation can be used to accomplish an iterative chain extension.<br>
The preferred mid-chained branched primary alkyl sulfates of the present invention can also be readily prepared as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A conventional bromoalcohol is reacted with triphenylphosphine followed by sodium hydride, suitably in dimethylsulfoxide/tetrahydrofuran, to form a Wittig adduct. The Wittig adduct is reacted with an alpha methyl ketone, forming an internally unsaturated methyl-branched alcoholate. Hydrogenation followed by sulfation yields the desired mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate. Although the Wittig approach does not allow the practitioner to extend the hydrocarbon chain, as in the Grignard sequence, the Wittig typically affords higher yields. See Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, M. Horiike et al., vol. 42 (1978), pp 1963-1965 included herein by reference. •<br>
Any alternative synthetic procedure in accordance with the invention may be used to prepare the branched primary alkyl sulfates. The mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates may, in addition be synthesized or formulated in the presence of the conventional homologs, for example any of those which may be formed in an industrial process which produces 2-alkyl branching as a result of hydroformylation. Mid-chain branched surfactant mixtures of the present invention are routinely added to other known commercial alkyl sulfates contained in the final laundry product formulation.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the surfactant mixtures of the present invention, especially those derived from fossil fuel sources involving commercial processes, comprise at least 1 mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 5, most preferably at least 8.<br>
Particularly suitable for preparation of certain surfactant mixtures of the present invention are "oxo" reactions wherein a branched chain olefm is subjected to catalytic isomerization and hydroformylation prior to sulfation. The preferred processes resulting in such mixtures utilize fossil fuels as the starting material feedstock, Preferred processes utilize Oxo reaction on linear olefms (alpha or internal) with a limited amount of branching, Suitable olefins may be made by dimerization of linear alpha or internal olefins, by controlled oligomerization of low molecular weight linear olefms, by skeletal rearrangement of detergent range olefins, by dehydrogenation/skeletal rearrangement of detergent range paraffins, or by Fischer-Tropsch reaction. These reactions will in general be controlled to:<br>
1)	give a large proportion of olefins in the desired detergent range (while<br>
allowing for the addition of a carbon atom in the subsequent Oxo<br>
reaction),<br>
2)	produce a limited number of branches, preferably mid-chain,<br>
3)	produce Cj-C} branches, more preferably ethyl, most preferably methyl,.<br>
4)	limit or eliminate gem dialkyl branching i.e. to avoid formation of<br>
quaternary carbon atoms.<br>
The suitable olefins can undergo Oxo reaction to give primary alcohols either directly or indirectly through the corresponding aldehydes. When an internal olefm is used, an Oxo catalyst is normally used which is capable of prior pre-isomerization of internal olefins primarily to alpha olefms. While a separately catalyzed (i.e. non-Oxo) internal to alpha isomerization could be effected, this is optional. On the other hand, if the olefm-forming step itself results directly in an alpha olefm (e.g. with high pressure Fischer-Tropsch olefins of detergent range), then use of a non-isomerizing Oxo catalyst is not only possible, but preferred. The scheme below summaries this process.<br>

The process described herein above gives the more preferred 5-methyl-hexadecyl sulfate in higher yield than the less preferred 2.4-dimethylpentadecyl sulfate. This mixture is desirable under the metes and bounds of the present invention in that each product comprises at total of 17 carbon atoms with linear alkyl chains having at least 13 carbon atoms.<br>

The following two analytical methods for characterizing branching in the present invention surfactant compositions are useful;<br>
1)	Separation and Identification of Components in Fatty Alcohols (prior to<br>
sulfation or after hydrolysis of alcohol sulfate for analytical purposes). The position<br>
and length of branching found in the precursor fatty alcohol materials is determined<br>
by GC/MS techniques [see: D. J. Harvey, Biomed, Environ. Mass Spectrom (1989).<br>
18(9), 719-23; D. J. Harvey, J. M. Tiffany, J. Chromatogr. (1984), 301(1), 173-87;<br>
K, A. Karlsson, B. E. Samuelsson, G. 0. Steen, Chem. Phys. Lipids (1973), 11(1),<br>
'17-38].<br>
2)	Identification of Separated Fatty Alcohol Sulfate Components by MS/MS.<br>
The position and length of branching is also determinable by Ion Spray-MS/MS or<br>
FAB-MS/MS techniques on previously isolated fatty alcohol sulfate components.<br>
The average total carbon atoms of the branched primary alkyl sulfates herein can be calculated from the hydroxyl value of the precursor fatty alcohol mix or from the hydroxyl value of the alcohols recovered by extraction after hydrolysis of the alcohol sulfate mix according to common procedures, such as outlined in "Bailey's Industrial Oil and Fat Products", Volume 2, Fourth Edition, edited by Daniel Swem, pp. 440-441. f linear Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate:<br>

AQA compounds wherein the hydrocarbyl substituent Rl is C8-C11, especially C10, enhance the rate of dissolution of laundry granules, especially under cold water conditions, as compared with the higher chain length materials. Accordingly, the C8-C11 AQA surfactants may be preferred by some formulators. The levels of the AQA surfactants used to prepare finished laundry detergent compositions can range from about 0.1% to about 5%, typically from about 0.45% to about 2.5%, by weight.<br>
According to the foregoing, the following are nonlimiting, specific<br>
illustrations of AQA surfactants used herein. It is to be understood that the degree of<br>
alkoxylation noted herein for the AQA surfactants is reported as an average,<br>
following common practice for conventional ethoxylated nonionic surfactants. This<br>
is because the ethoxylation reactions typically yield mixtures of materials with<br>
differing degrees of ethoxylation. Thus, it is not uncommon to report total EO<br>
values other than as whole numbers, e.g., "EO2.5", "E03.5", and the like.<br>

ingredients can be provided as finished products in the form of liquids, gels, bars, or the like using conventional techniques, the manufacture of the granular laundry detergents herein requires some special processing techniques in order to achieve optimal performance. Accordingly, the manufacture of laundry granules will be described hereinafter separately in the Granules Manufacture section (below), for the convenience of the formulator.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Surfactant systems of the type herein can be used in all manner of cleaning compositions. The detergent compositions of the invention thus may also contain additional detergent components. The precise nature of these additional components, and levels of incorporation thereof will depend on the physical form of the composition, and the precise nature of the cleaning operation for which it is to be used. The longer-chain mid-chain branched derivatives are more soluble than expected and the shorter-chain derivatives clean better than expected. Cleaning compositions herein include, but are not limited to: granular, bar-form and liquid laundry detergents; liquid hand dishwashing compositions; liquid, gel and bar-form personal cleansing products; shampoos; dentifrices; hard surface cleaners, and the like. Such compositions can contain a variety of conventional detersive ingredients.<br>
The following listing of such ingredients is for the convenience of the formulator, and not by way of limitation of the types of ingredients which can be used with the branched-chain surfactants herein.

Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv, Inorg. Bioinorg. Mech,T (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)50Ac] Ty, wherein "OAc" represents an acetate moiety and "Ty" is an anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)50Ac]Cl2; as well as [Co(NH3)5OAc](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAcj(PF6)2; [Co(NH3)50Ac](S04); [Co(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)50Ac](NO3)2 (herein "PAC").<br>
These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in the Tobe article and the references cited therein, in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989, J. Chem. Ed. (1989), M (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3: Inorg. Chem.. IS, 1497-1502 (1979); Inorg. Chem..<br>

jEnzymes - Enzymes are preferably included in the present detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains from substrates, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer in fabric laundering, and for fabric restoration. Suitable enzymes include proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Preferred selections are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal care detergent composition. Preferred detersive enzymes are hydrolases such as proteases, amylases and lipases. Preferred enzymes for laundry purposes include, but are not limited to, proteases, cellulases, lipases and peroxidases. Highly preferred for automatic dishwashing are amylases and/or proteases, including both current commercially available types and improved types which, though more and more bleach compatible though successive improvements, have a remaining degree of bleach deactivation susceptibility.<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics, dishware and the like. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more<br>
typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. For certain detergents, such as in automatic dishwashing, it may be desirable to increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve spotting/filming or other end-results. Higher active levels may also be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>
Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. One suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum, activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASE® by Novo Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter "Novo". The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1,243,784 to Novo.

Amylases suitable herein, especially for, but not limited to automatic dishwashing purposes, include, for example, a-amylases described in GB 1,296,839 to Novo; RAPIDASE®, International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. and TERMAMYL®, Novo. FUNGAMYL® from Novo is especially useful. Engineering of enzymes for improved stability, e.g., oxidative stability, is known. See, for example J, Biological Chem., Vol. 260, No. 11, June 1985, pp. 6518-6521. Certain preferred embodiments of the present compositions can make use of amylases having improved stability in detergents such as automatic dishwashing types, especially improved oxidative stability as measured against a reference-point of TERMAMYL® in commercial use in 1993. These preferred amylases herein share the characteristic of being "stability-enhanced" amylases, characterized, at a minimum, by a measurable improvement in one or more of: oxidative stability, e.g., to hydrogen peroxide/tetraacetylethylenediamine in buffered solution at pH 9-10; thermal stability, e.g., at common wash temperatures such as about 60°C; or alkaline stability, e.g., at a pH from about S to about 11, measured versus the above-identified reference-point amylase. Stability can be measured using any of the art-disclosed technical tests. See, for example, references disclosed in WO 9402597. Stability-enhanced amylases can be obtained from Novo or from Genencor International. One class of highly preferred amylases herein have the commonality of being derived using site-directed mutagenesis from one or more of the Bacillus amylases, especially the Bacillus a-amylases, regardless of whether one, two or multiple amylase strains are the immediate precursors, Oxidative stability-enhanced amylases vs. the above-identified reference amylase are preferred for use, especially in bleaching, more preferably oxygen bleaching, as distinct from chlorine bleaching, detergent compositions herein. Such preferred amylases include (a) an amylase according to the hereinbefore incorporated WO 9402597, Novo, Feb. 3, 1994, as further illustrated by a mutant in which substitution is made, using alanine or threonine, preferably threonine, of the methionine residue located in position 197 of the B. lichenifonnis alpha-amylase, known as TERMAMYL®, or the homologous position variation of a similar parent amylase, such as B, amyloliquefaciens, B subtilis, or B. stearothermophilus; (b) stability-enhanced amylases as described by<br>
Genencor International in a paper entitled "Oxidatively Resistant alpha-Amylases" presented at the 207th American Chemical Society National Meeting, March 13-17 1994, by C. Mitchinson. Therein it was noted that bleaches in automatic dishwashing detergents inactivate alpha-amylases but that improved oxidative stability amylases have been made by Genencor from B. licheniformis NCIB8061. Methionine (Met) was identified as the most likely residue to be modified. Met was substituted, one at a time, in positions 8, 15, 197, 256, 304, 366 and 438 leading to specific mutants, particularly important being M197L and M197T with the MI97T . variant being the most stable expressed variant. Stability was measured in CASCADE® and SUNLIGHT®; (c) particularly preferred amylases herein include amylase variants having additional modification in the immediate parent as described in WO 9510603 A and are available from the assignee, Novo, as DURAMYL®. Other particularly preferred oxidative stability enhanced amylase include those described in WO 9418314 to Genencor International and WO 9402597 to Novo. Any other oxidative stability-enhanced amylase can be used, for example as derived by site-directed mutagenesis from known chimeric, hybrid or simple mutant parent forms of available amylases, Other preferred enzyme modifications are accessible, See WO 9509909 A to Novo.<br>
Other amylase enzymes include those described in WO 95/26397 and in co-pending application by Novo Nordisk PCT/DK96/00056. Specific amylase enzymes for use in the detergent compositions of the present invention include a-amylases characterized by having a specific activity at least 25% higher than the specific activity of Termamyl® at a temperature range of 25°C to 55°C and at a pH value in the range of 8 to 10, measured by the Phadebas® a-amylase activity assay, (Such Phadebas® a-amylase activity assay is described at pages 9-10, WO 95/26397.) Also included herein are a-amylases which are at least 80% homologous with the amino acid sequences shown in the SEQ ID listings in the references. These enzymes are preferably incorporated into laundry detergent compositions at a level from 0.00018% to 0.060% pure enzyme by weight of the total composition, more preferably from 0.00024% to 0.048% pure enzyme by weight of the total composition.<br>

Hpolyticwn NRRLB 3673 from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan; Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp., U.S.A. and Disoynth Co., The Netherlands, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli, LIPOLASE® enzyme derived from Humicola lanuginosa and commercially available from Novo, see also EP 341,947, is a preferred lipase for use herein. Lipase and amylase variants stabilized against peroxidase enzymes are described in WO 9414951 A to Novo. See also WO 9205249 and RD 94359044.<br>
In spite of the large number of publications on lipase enzymes, only the lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa and produced in Aspergillus oryzae as host has so far found widespread application as additive for fabric washing products. It is available from Novo Nordisk under the tradename Lipolase™, as noted above. In order to optimize the stain removal performance of Lipolase, Novo Nordisk have made a number of variants. As described in WO 92/05249, the D96L variant of the native Humicola lanuginosa lipase improves the lard stain removal efficiency by a factor 4,4 over the wild-type lipase (enzymes compared in an amount ranging from 0.075 to 2.5 mg protein per liter), Research Disclosure No. 35944 published on March 10, 1994, by Novo Nordisk discloses that the lipase variant (D96L) may be added in an amount corresponding to 0.001-100-mg (5-500,000 LU/liter) lipase variant per liter of wash liquor. The present invention provides the benefit of improved whiteness maintenance on fabrics using low levels of D96L variant in detergent compositions containing the mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants in the manner disclosed herein, especially when the D96L is used at levels in the range of about 50 LU to about 8500 LU per liter of wash solution.<br>
Cutinase enzymes suitable for use herein are described in WO 8809367 A to Genencor.<br>
Peroxidase enzymes may be used in combination with oxygen sources, e.g., percarbonate, perborate, hydrogen peroxide, etc., for "solution bleaching" or prevention of transfer of dyes or pigments removed from substrates during the wash to other substrates present in the wash solution, Known peroxidases include<br>
horseradish peroxidase, ligninase, and haloperoxidases such as chloro- or bromo-peroxidase. Peroxidase-containing detergent compositions are disclosed in WO 89099813 A, October 19, 1989 toNovo and WO 8909813 A toNovo.<br>
A range of enzyme materials and means for their incorporation into synthetic detergent compositions is also disclosed in WO 9307263 A and WO 9307260 A to Genencor International, WO 8908694 A to Novo, and U.S. 3,553,139, January 5, 1971 to McCarty et al. Enzymes are further disclosed in U.S. 4,101,457, Place et al, July 18, 1978, and in U.S. 4,507,219, Hughes, March 26, 1985. Enzyme materials useful for liquid detergent formulations, and their incorporation into such formulations, are disclosed in U.S. 4,261,868, Hora et al, April 14, 1981. Enzymes for use in detergents can be stabilized by various techniques. Enzyme stabilization techniques are disclosed and exemplified in U.S. 3,600,319, August 17, 197], Gedge et al, EP 199,405 and,EP 200,586, October 29, 1986, Venegas. Enzyme stabilization systems are also described, for example, in U.S. 3,519,570. A useful Bacillus, sp. AC 13 giving proteases, xylanases and cellulases, is described in WO 9401532 A to Novo.<br>
Enzyme Stabilizing System - The enzyme-containing compositions herein may optionally also comprise from about 0.001% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.005% to about 8%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 6%, by weight of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme. Such a system may be inherently provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the formulator or by a manufacturer of detergent-ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems can, for example, comprise calcium ion, boric acid, propylene glycol, short chain carboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.<br>
One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes. Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein if only one type of cation is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate,<br>
calcium malate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.<br>
Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species. See Severson, U.S. 4,537,706. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate are suitable for liquid detergent use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives.<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions, for example automatic dishwashing compositions, may further comprise from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions. While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during dish- or fabric-washing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or percarbonate, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use. Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolarnine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used. Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylate, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if<br>
desired. In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better recognized functions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorly incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients. In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage. Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in US 4,652,392, Baginski et al.<br>
Ijuilderg - Detergent builders selected from aluminosilicates and silicates are preferably included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of particulate soils from surfaces.<br>
Suitable silicate builders include water-soluble and hydrous solid types and including those having chain-, layer-, or three-dimensional- structure as well as amorphous-solid or non-structured-liquid types. Preferred are alkali metal silicates, particularly those liquids and solids having a SiC^-'N^O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1, including, particularly for automatic dishwashing purposes, solid hydrous 2-ratio silicates marketed by PQ Corp. under the tradename BRITESIL®, e.g., BRITESIL H20; and layered silicates, e.g., those described in U.S. 4,664,839, May 12, 1987, H, P. Rieck. NaSKS-6, sometimes abbreviated "SKS-6", is a crystalline layered aluminum-free 8-Na2Si05 morphology silicate marketed by Hoechst and is preferred especially in granular laundry compositions. See preparative methods in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. Other layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+ryH20 wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0, can also or alternately be used herein. Layered silicates from Hoechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSK.S-11, as the a, P and y layer-silicate forms. Other silicates may also be useful, such as magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granules, as a stabilizing agent for bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Also suitable for use herein are synthesized crystalline ion exchange materials or hydrates thereof having chain structure and a composition represented by the following general formula in an anhydride form: xM2O-ySiO2.zM'0 wherein<br>
M is Na and/or K, M1 is Ca and/or Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0 and 2/x is 0.005 to 1.0 as taught in U.S. 5,427,711, Sakaguchi et al, June 27, 1995.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are especially useful in granular detergents, but can also be incorporated in liquids, pastes or gels. Suitable for the present purposes are those having empirical formula: [Mz(AlO2)2(Si02)v]'xH20 wherein z and v are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of zto v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer from 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived. An aluminosilicate production method is in U.S. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite P, the so-called Zeolite MAP, Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used. Zeolite A has the formula: Nai2[(Al02)i2(SiO2)l2]"xH2O wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0,1 -10 microns in diameter.<br>
Detergent builders in place of or in addition to the silicates and aluminosilicates described hereinbefore can optionally be included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of particuiate soils from surfaces. Builders can operate via a variety of mechanisms including forming soluble or insoluble -complexes with hardness ions, by ion exchange, and by offering a surface more favorable to the precipitation of hardness ions than are the surfaces of articles to be cleaned. Builder level can vary widely depending upon end use and physical form of the composition. Built detergents typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Liquid formulations typically comprise about 5% to about 50%, more typically 5% to 35% of builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically 15% to 50% builder by weight of the detergent composition. Lower or higher levels of builders are not excluded. For example, certain detergent additive or high-surfactant formuiations can be unbuilt,<br>
Suitable builders herein can be selected from the group consisting of phosphates and polyphosphates, especially the sodium salts; carbonates, bicarbonates, sesquicarbonates and carbonate minerals other than sodium carbonate or sesquicarbonate; organic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylates especially water-soluble nonsurfactant carboxylates in acid, sodium, potassium or alkanolamrnonium salt form, as well as oligomeric or water-soluble low molecular weight polymer carboxylates including aliphatic and aromatic types; and phytic acid. These may be complemented by borates, e.g., for pH-buffering purposes, or by sulfates, especially<br>
sodium sulfate and any other fillers or'carriers which may be important to the engineering of stable surfactant and/or builder-containing detergent compositions.<br>
Builder mixtures, sometimes termed "builder systems" can be used and typically comprise two or more conventional builders, optionally complemented by chelants, pH-bufters or fillers, though these latter materials are generally accounted for separately when describing quantities of materials herein. In terms of relative quantities of surfactant and builder in the present detergents, preferred builder systems are typically formulated at a weight ratio of surfactant to builder of from about 60:1 to about 1:80. Certain preferred laundry detergents have said ratio in the range 0,90:1.0 to 4.0:1.0, more preferably from 0,95:1.0 to 3.0:1,0.<br>
P-containing detergent builders often preferred where permitted by legislation include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkariolammonium salts of polyphosphates exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, glassy polymeric meta-phosphates; and phosphonates.<br>
Suitable carbonate builders include alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973, although sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, and other carbonate minerals such as trona or any convenient multiple salts of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate such as those having the composition 2Na2CO3-CaCO3 when anhydrous, and even calcium carbonates including calcite, aragonite and vaterite, especially forms having high surface areas relative to compact calcite may be useful, for example as seeds or for use in synthetic detergent bars.<br>
Suitable organic detergent builders include polycarboxylate compounds, including water-soluble nonsurfactant dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates. More typically builder polycarboxylates have a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Carboxylate builders can be formulated in acid, partially neutral, neutral or overbased form, When in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred. Polycarboxylate builders include the ether polycarboxylates, such as oxydisuccinate, see Berg, U.S. 3,128,287, April 7, 1964, and Lambert! et al&gt; U.S. 3,635,830, January 18, 1972; "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071, Bush et al, May 5, 1987; and other ether carboxylates including cyclic and alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158»635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other suitable builders are the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether; 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid; carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid; the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid; as well as mellitic acid, succinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxy-methyloxysuccmic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrates, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof are important carboxylate builders e.g., for heavy duty liquid detergents, due to availability from renewable resources and biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicates. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Where permitted, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations and in granular laundry compositions, alkali metal phosphates such as sodium tripoiyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates, e.g., those of U.S. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137 can also be used and may have desirable antiscaling properties.<br>
Certain detersive surfactants or their short-chain homologs also have a builder action. For unambiguous formula accounting purposes, when they have surfactant capability, these materials are summed up as detersive surfactants. Preferred types for builder functionality are illustrated by: 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush, January 28, 1986. Succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof, Succinate builders also include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like, Lauryl-succinates are described in European Patent Application 86200690,5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986. Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be-incorporated into the compositions as surfactant/builder materials alone or in combination with the aforementioned builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al, March 13,1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, March 7, 1967. See also Diehl, U.S. 3,723,322,<br>
Other types of inorganic builder materials which can be used have the formula (Mx)i Cay (CO3)Z wherein x and i are integers from 1 to 15, y is an integer from I to 10, z is an integer from 2 to 25, M{ are cations, at least one of which is a water-soluble, and the equation Sj = 1-15(xi multiplied by the valence of Mj) + 2y = 2z is satisfied such that the formula has a neutral or "balanced" charge. These builders are referred to herein as "Mineral Builders". Waters of hydration or anions other than<br>
carbonaie may be added provided that the overall charge is balanced or neutral. The charge or valence effects of such anions should be added to the right side of the above equation. Preferably, there is present a water-soluble cation selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, water-soluble metals, hydrogen, boron, ammonium, silicon, and mixtures thereof, more preferably, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, lithium, amjnonium and mixtures thereof, sodium and potassium being highly preferred.

The detergent compositions according to the present invention preferably further comprise additional surfactants, herein also referred to as co-surfactants. It is to be understood that the surfactant systems prepared in the manner of the present invention may be used singly in cleaning compositions or in combination with other detersive surfactants. Typically, fully-formulated cleaning compositions will contain a mixture of surfactant types in order to obtain broad-scale cleaning performance over a variety of soils and stains and under a variety of usage conditions. One advantage of the branched-chain surfactants herein is their ability to be readily formulated in combination with other known surfactant types. Nonlimiting examples of additional surfactants which may be used herein typically at levels from about \% to about 55%, by weight, include the unsaturated sulfates such as oleyl sulfate, the C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfates), C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-C18 glycerol ether sulfates, the C10-C18 alkyl<br>

Other sugar-derived surfactants include the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18 N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide. The N-propyl through N-hexyl C12-C18 glucamides can be used for low sudsing, C10-C20 conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C10-C16 soaps may be used.<br>
A wide range of these co-surfactants can be used in the detergent compositions of the present invention, A typical listing of anionic, nonionic, ampholytic and zwirterionic classes, and species of these co-surfactants, is given in US Patent 3,664,961 issued to Norris on May 23, 1972.

The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those having the structural formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is selected from anilino, N-2*bis-hydroxyethyl and NH-2-hydroxyethyl; R2 is selected from N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl, N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methyiamino, morphilino, chloro and arnino; and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium or potassium.<br>
When in the above formula, Rj is anilino, R2 is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'&gt;-bis[(4*anilino-6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid and disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal-UNPA-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation. TinopaJ-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.<br>
When in the above formula, Rj is aniline, R2 is N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-2-methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-ariilino-6-(N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylaniino)-$-triazme-2-yl)aniino]2,2l-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt.

The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., PVNO and/or PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (e.g., Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in aqueous wash solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components when used alone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brighteners work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics. The extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient". The exhaustion coefficient is in general as the ratio of a) the brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the wash liquor, Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.<br>
Of course, it will be appreciated that other, conventional optical brightener types of compounds can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect. Such usage is conventional and well-known to detergent formulations,<br>
Chelating Agents - The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or mote iron and/or manganese chelating agents. Such chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylates, amino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures therein, all as hereinafter defined. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the benefit of these materials is due in part to their exceptional ability<br>
to remove iron and manganese ions from washing solutions by formation of soluble chelates.<br>
Amino carboxylates useful as optional chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetracetates, N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetates, nitrilotri-acetates, ethylenediamine tetraproprionates, triethylenetetraaminehexacetates, diethylenetriaminepentaacetates, and ethanoldiglycines, alkali metal, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts therein and mixtures therein.<br>
Amino phosphonates are also suitable for use as chelating agents in the compositions of the invention when at lease low levels of total phosphorus are permitted in detergent compositions, and include ethylenediaminetetrakis (methylenephosphonates) as BEQUEST. Preferred, these amino phosphonates to not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents are also useful in the compositions herein, See U.S. Patent 3,812,044, issued May 21, 1974, to Connor et al. Preferred compounds of this type in acid form are dihydroxydisulfobenzene.s such as l,2-dihydroxy-3,5-disulfobenzene.<br>
A preferred biodegradable chelator for use herein is ethylenediamine disuccinate ("EDDS"), especially the [S,S] isomer as described in U.S. Patent 4,704,233, November 3, 1987, to Hartman and Perkins.<br>
The compositions herein may also contain water-soluble methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) salts (or acid form) as a chelant or co-builder useful with, for example, insoluble builders such as zeolites, layered silicates and the like,<br>
If utilized, these chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, if utilized, the chelating agents will comprise from about 0.1% to about 3.0% by weight of such compositions.<br>
guds Suppressors - Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" as described in U.S. 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and in front-loading European-style washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of particular interest encompasses nionocarboxyiic fatty acid and soluble salts therein. See U.S. Patent 2,954,347, issued September 27, 1960 to Wayne St. John. The<br>
monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium salts, and ammonium and alkanolarnmonium salts.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also contain non-surfactant suds suppressors. These include, for example: high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty acid esters (e.g., fatty acid triglycerides), fatty acid esters of monovalent alcohols, aliphatic C18-C40 ketones (e.g., stearone), etc. Other suds inhibitors include N-alkylated amino triazines such as tri- to hexa-alkylmelamines or di- to tetra-alkyldiamine chlortriazines formed as products of cyanuric chloride with two or three moles of a primary or secondary amine containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, propylene oxide, and monostearyl phosphates such as monostearyl alcohol phosphate ester and monostearyl di-alkali metal (e.g., K, Na, and Li) phosphates and phosphate esters. The hydrocarbons such as paraffin and haloparaffiri can be utilized in liquid form. The liquid hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have a pour point in the range of about -40°C and about 50°C, and a minimum boiling point not less than about 110°C (atmospheric pressure). It is also known to utilize waxy hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100°C. The hydrocarbons constitute a preferred category of suds suppressor for detergent compositions. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al. The hydrocarbons, thus, include aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and heterocyclic saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons having from about 12 to about 70 carbon atoms. The term "paraffin," as used in this suds suppressor discussion, is intended to include mixtures of true paraffins and cyclic hydrocarbons.<br>
Another preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the use of polyorganosiloxane oils, such as polydimethylsiloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiloxane oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxane with silica particles wherein the polyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art and are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al and European Patent Application No. 89307851.9, published February 7, 1990, by Starch, M. S.<br>

Other suds suppressors useful herein comprise the secondary alcohols (e.g., 2-alkyl alkanols) and mixtures of such alcohols with silicone oils, such as the silicones disclosed in U.S. 4,798,679, 4,075,118 and EP 150,872. The secondary alcohols include the C6-C16 alkyl alcohols having aC1-C16  chain. A preferred alcohol is 2-butyl octanol, which is available from Condea under the trademark ISOFOL 12. Mixtures of secondary alcohols are available under the trademark ISALCHEM 123 from Enichem. Mixed suds suppressors typically comprise mixtures of alcohol + silicone at a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1.<br>
For any detergent compositions to be used in automatic laundry washing machines, suds should not form to the extent that they overflow the washing machine. Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a "suds suppressing amount. By "suds suppressing amount11 is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines,<br>
The compositions herein will generally comprise from 0% to about 10% of suds suppressor. When utilized as suds suppressors, monocarboxylic fatty acids, and salts therein, will be present typically in amounts up to about 5%, by weight, of the detergent composition. Preferably, from about 0.5% to about 3% of fatty monocarboxylate suds suppressor is utilized. Silicone suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts up to about 2.0%, by weight, of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. This upper limit is practical in nature, due primarily to concern with keeping costs minimized and effectiveness of lower<br>
amounts for effectively controlling sudsing. Preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. As used herein, these weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any adjunct materials that may be utilized. Monostearyl phosphate suds suppressors are generally utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.01% to about 5.0%, although higher levels can be used. The alcohol suds suppressors are typically used at 0.2%-3% by weight of the finished compositions,<br>
Alkoxylated Polvcarboxvlates - Alkoxylated polycarboxylates such as those prepared from polyacrylates are useful herein to provide additional grease removal performance. Such materials are described in WO 91/08281 and PCT 90/01815 at p. 4 et seq., incorporated herein by reference.

Clay softeners can be used in combination with amine and cationic softeners as disclosed, for example, in U,S. Patent 4,375,416, Crisp et al, March 1, 1983 and U.S. Patent 4,291,071, Harris et al, issued September 22,1981.<br>

Carriers such as diethylphthalate can be used in the finished perfume compositions.<br>
Other Ingredients - A wide variety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can be included in the compositions herein, including other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations, solid fillers for bar compositions, etc. If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C10-C16  alkanolamides can be incorporated into the compositions, typically at 1%-10% levels. The C10-C14 monoethanol and diethanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters. Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also advantageous. If desired, water-soluble magnesium and/or calcium salts such as MgCl2, MgSO4 CaCl2, CaSO4ty and the like, can be added at levels of, typically, 0.1%-2°/o, to provide additional suds and to enhance grease removal performance.<br>
Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobic coating, Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous substrate, In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function,<br>
To illustrate this technique in more detail, a porous hydrophobic silica (trademark SIPERNAT D10, DeGussa) is admixed with a proteolytic enzyme solution containing 3%-5% of C13-15 ethoxylated alcohol (EO 7) nonionic surfactant. Typically, the enzyme/surfactant solution is 2.5 X the weight of silica. The resulting powder is dispersed with stirring in silicone oil (various silicone oil viscosities in the range of 500-12,500 can be used), The resulting silicone oil dispersion is emulsified or otherwise added to the final detergent matrix. By this means, ingredients such as the aforementioned enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, photoactivators, dyes, fluorescers, fabric conditioners and hydrolyzable surfactants can be "protected" for use in detergents, including liquid laundry detergent compositions.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers.    Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6,5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 10.5. Liquid dishwashing product formulations' preferably have a pH between about 6.8 and about 9.0. Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art. form of the compositions<br>
The compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including granular, tablet, bar and liquid forms. The compositions are particularly the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load,<br>
The mean particle size of the components of granular compositions in accordance with the invention should preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles are greater1 than 1.7mm in diameter and not more than 5% of particles are less than 0.15mm in diameter.<br>
The term mean particle size as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained are plotted against the aperture size of the sieves, The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
The bulk density of granular detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention typically have a bulk density of at least 600 g/litre, more preferably from 650 g/Htre to 1200 g/litre. Bulk density is measured by means of a simple funnel and cup device consisting of a conical funnel moulded rigidly on a base and provided with a flap valve at its lower extremity to allow the contents of the funnel to be emptied into an axially aligned cylindrical cup disposed below the funnel. The funnel is 130 mm high and has internal diameters of 130 mm and 40 mm at its respective upper and lower extremities. It is mounted so that the lower extremity is 140 mm above the upper surface of the base. The cup has an overall<br>
height of 90 mm, an internal height of 87 mm and an internal diameter of 84 mrn. Its nominal volume is 500 ml.<br>
To carry out a measurement, the runnel is filled with powder by hand pouring, the flap valve is opened and powder allowed to overfill the cup. The filled cup is removed from the frame and excess powder removed from the cup by passing a straight edged implement e.g., a knife, across its upper edge. The filled cup is then weighed and the value obtained for the weight of powder doubled to provide a bulk density in g/litre. Replicate measurements are made as required. Surfactant system agglomerate particles<br>
The surfactant system herein is preferably present in granular compositions in the form of agglomerate particles, which may take the form of flakes, prills, marumes, noodles, ribbons, but preferably take the form of granules. The most preferred way to process the particles is by agglomerating powders (e.g. aluminosilicate, carbonate) with high active mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate pastes and to control the particle size of the resultant agglomerates within specified limits. Such a process involves mixing an effective amount of powder with a high active mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate paste in one or more agglomerators such as a pan agglomerator, a Z-blade mixer or more preferably an inline mixer such as those manufactured by Schugi (Holland) BV, 29 Chroomstraat 8211 AS, Lelystad, Netherlands, and Gebruder Lodige Maschinenbau GmbH, D-4790 Paderbom 1, Elsenerstrasse 7-9, Postfach 2050, Germany. Most preferably a high shear mixer is used, such as a Lodige CB (Trade Name),<br>
A high active mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate paste comprising from 50% by weight to 95% by weight, preferably 70% by weight to 85% by weight of mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate is typically used. The paste may be pumped into the agglomerator at a temperature high enough to maintain a pumpable viscosity, but low enough to avoid degradation of the surfactants used. An operating temperature of the paste of 50°C to 80°C is typical, Laundry washing method<br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry detergent composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is meant from 20g to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods.<br>
As noted, the surfactant system are used herein in detergent compositions, preferably in combination with other detersive surfactants, at levels which are effective for achieving at least a directional improvement in cleaning performance. In the context of a fabric laundry composition, such "usage levels" can vary depending not only on the type and severity of the soils and stains, but also on the wash water temperature, the volume of wash water and the type of washing machine.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the amount of mid-chain branched primary alky] sulfate surfactant used in a machine-wash laundering context can vary, depending on the habits and practices of the user, the type of washing machine, and the like.<br>
In a preferred use aspect a dispensing device is employed in the washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the commencement of the wash cycle. Its volume capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.<br>
Once the washing machine has been loaded with laundry the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drain. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates, The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
To allow for release of the detergent product during the wash the device may possess a number of openings through which the product may pass. Alternatively, the device may be made of a material which is permeable to liquid but impermeable to the solid product, which will allow release of dissolved product. Preferably, the detergent product will be rapidly released at the start of the wash cycle thereby providing transient localised high concentrations of product in the drum of the washing machine at this stage of the wash cycle,<br>
Preferred dispensing devices are reusable and are designed in such a way that container integrity is maintained in both the dry state and during the wash cycle. Especially preferred dispensing devices for use with the composition of the invention have been described in the following patents; GB-B-2,157,717, GB-B-2, 157, 718, EP-A-0201376, EP-A-0288345 and EP-A-0288346, An article by' J. Bland published in Manufacturing Chemist, November 1989, pages 41-46 also describes especially preferred dispensing devices for use with granular laundry<br>
products which are of a type commonly know as the "granulette". Another preferred dispensing device for use with the compositions of this invention is disclosed in PCT Patent Application No. W094/11562.<br>
Especially preferred dispensing devices are disclosed in European Patent Application Publication Nos. 0343069 &amp; 0343070. The latter Application discloses a device comprising a flexible sheath in the form of a bag extending from a support ring defining an orifice, the orifice being adapted to admit to the bag sufficient product for one washing cycle in a washing process. A portion of the washing medium flows through the orifice into the bap, dissolves the product, and the solution then passes outwardly through the orifice into the washing medium. The support ring is provided with a masking arrangement to prevent egress of wetted, undissolved, product, this arrangement typically comprising radially extending walls extending from a central boss in a spoked wheel configuration, or a similar structure in which the walls have a helical form.<br>
Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a   • bag or pouch. The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No. 0018678, Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500, 0011501, 0011502, and 0011968. A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene. Machine dishwashing methotj<br>
Any suitable methods for machine washing or cleaning soiled tableware, particularly soiled silverware are envisaged.<br>
A preferred machine dishwashing method comprises treating soiled articles selected from crockery, glassware, hollowware, silverware and cutlery and mixtures thereof, with an aqueous liquid having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine dishwashing composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the machine dishwashing composition it is meant from 8g to 60g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 3 to 10 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine dishwashing methods.<br>

Fxample 5<br>
Sodium salts of branched sulfated surfactants are made by reaction of the<br>
appropriate branched alcohols with chlorosulfonic acid in ethyl ether. The resulting<br>
acid is neutralized with a stoichiometric amount of sodium methoxide in methanol<br>
and the solvents are evaporated via vacuum oven. The branched alcohols are made<br>
from linear olefms (alpha and/or internal olefms) that have been molecularly re<br>
arranged by exposure to appropriate catalysts. No additional carbons are added in<br>
this re-arrangement, but the starting olefin is isomerized so that it now contains one<br>
or more alkyl branches along the main alkyl chain. As the olefin moiety stays intact<br>
throughout this molecular re-arrangement, a - CH20H group is then added via<br>
hydroformyl&amp;tion chemistry. The following Shell Research experimental test<br>
alcohol samples are sulfated.<br>
