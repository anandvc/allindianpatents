				<td>Coloured polypropylene composition having a high content of β-modification<br><br>
The present invention relates to a coloured β -nucleated polypropylene composition, in particular to a green polypropylene composition containing inorganic pigment and having a high content of β -modification.<br><br>
Background of the invention<br><br>
Polypropylene materials are frequently used for pipes for various purposes, such as fluid transport, i.e. transport of liquid or gas, e.g. water or natural gas, during which the fluid is pressurised and/or heated. In particular, polypropylene materials are used in applications for plumbing and heating, such as in-house hot and cold water pipes and fittings, floor and wall heating systems and radiator connections.<br><br>
From EP1448631 it is known to use polypropylene which crystallises predominantly in the β -modification for pressure pipes having increased long-term pressure resistance. Polypropylene which crystallises predominantly in the β -modification has an increased impact strength compared to polypropylene when it is crystallised in the α -modification. Generally, the higher the amount of β -modification, the better the impact strength of the polypropylene will be.<br><br>
With regard to polypropylene pipes, impact strength of pipes is often measured by the falling weight impact test at 0°C according to EN 1411. For pipes this is a more practice-oriented parameter, since it correlates to the resistance of the pipe against breakage during installation, especially at low temperatures.<br><br>
Further, it is customary to use coloured polypropylene for these applications. A number of organic and inorganic pigments exist, which are used for the production of coloured polypropylene. However, many organic pigments are unsuitable for the production of coloured polypropylene having a high content of β -modification, because organic pigments are often acting as strong α -nucleating agents. When both a-nucleating agents and β -nucleating agents are present in a polypropylene, the α -nucleating agent is usually predominant, because the α -modification is thermodynamically more favoured than the β -modification. Inorganic pigments are favoured for the abovementioned purposes.<br><br>
One of the usual colours which is used for such materials is green. Usually, the colour green is achieved by the use of specific inorganic pigments, especially the pigments C.I. Pigment Green 17, C.I. pigment 26 and C.I. Pigment Green 50 (c.f. Plastics Additives Handboek, 5th Edition, Edited by Dr. Hans Zweifel. Carl Hanser Verlag. Munich 2001, p. 849). Chemically, CI. Pigment Green 17 is Cr2O3- It is also identified by CAS NO. 68909-79-5. Chemically, CI. Pigment Green 26 is COCr2O4. It is also identified by CAS NO. 68187-49-5. Chemically, CI. Pigment Green 50 is (CO,Ni,Zn)2TiO4. It is also identified by CAS NO. 68186-85-6.<br><br>
It was however observed, that the use of the abovementioned pigments to produce a green coloured - β nucleated polypropylene composition has the disadvantage that the impact strength (measured as falling weight impact test) is still unsatisfactory.<br><br>
Object of Invention<br><br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a green coloured β -nucleated polypropylene composition having a high content of β -modification, where pipes, which are produced from the inventive polypropylene composition shall exhibit a higher impact strength than pipes which are made from green coloured β-nucleated polypropylene compositions containing an inorganic green pigment.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the above object could be achieved by a process, wherein the polypropylene composition comprises at least one β -nucleating agent and an inorganic blue pigment and an inorganic yellow pigment.<br><br>
It has surprisingly been observed, that a green coloured B-nucleated polypropylene composition, which contains an inorganic blue and an inorganic yellow pigment instead of an inorganic green pigment shows significantly improved impact strength, measured by the falling weight impact test at O'C according to EN 1411 on pipes.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inorganic blue pigment is selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment blue 28 (CAS No. 68186-86-7), CI. Pigment blue 36 (CAS No. 68187-11-1), C.I. pigment blue 36:1 (CAS No. 74665-01-3), C.I. Pigment blue 72 (CAS No. 68186-87-8), C.I. pigment blue 29 (CAS No. 57455-37-5), C.I. pigment blue 35 (CAS No. 68187-05-3) and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The mentioned blue pigments are also listed in the table below, together with their chemical formula.<br>
TABLE<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention the inorganic blue pigment is selected from the group consisting of CI. pigment blue 28 (CAS No. 68186-86-7), CI. Pigment blue 36 (CAS No. 68187-11-1), CI. pigment blue 36:1 (CAS No. 74665-01-3), CI. pigment blue 72 (CAS No. 68186-87-8) and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The aforementioned blue pigments are spinals based on COAI2O4, where C and/or Ai can be partially replaced by other metals like Cr and/or Zn.<br><br>
It has have observed, that with the use of one or more of the abovementioned spinel type inorganic blue pigments, the impact strength of the inventive green coloured β -nucieated polypropyiene compositions is remarkably improved.<br>
According to a particularly profaned embodiment of the present invention, the inorganic blue pigment is CI. pigment blue 28 (CAS No. 68186-86-7).<br>
It has been observed, that with the use of the abovementioned spinel type inorganic blue pigment, the impact strength of the inventive green coloured ll-nucleated polypropyiene compositions is most improved.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention the inorganic yellow pigment is selected from the group consisting of Cl. pigment yellow 53 (CAS No. 71077-18-4), Cl. pigment yellow 119 (CAS No. 68187-51-9), Cl. pigment yellow 157 (CAS No. 68610-24-2), Cl. pigment yellow 161 (CAS No. 68611-43-8), Cl. pigment yellow 162 (CAS No. 68611-42-7), Cl. pigment yellow 163 (CAS No. 68186-92-5), Cl. pigment yellow 164 (CAS No. 68412-38-4), Cl. pigment yellow 184 (CAS No. 14059-33-7), Cl. pigment yellow 189 (CAS No. 69011-05-8) and mixtures thereof.<br>
It has been observed, that with the use of one or more of the abovementioned inorganic yellow  pigments,  the  impact   strength   of  the   inventive  green  coloured   R-nucleated ;     polypropyiene compositions is remarkably improved.<br><br><br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, inorganic yellow pigment is Cl. pigment yeilow 184 (CAS No. 14059-33-7).<br>
It has been observed, that with the use of the abovementioned inorganic yellow pigment, the impact strength of the inventive green coloured l^nucieated polypropylene compositions is most improved.<br>
Pigments, which act as a-nucieating agents should preferably be not present in the inventive polypropylene compositions at all, or only in such an amount, that they do not adversely affect the desired properties, i.e. mainly the increased content of H-modification and thus the impact strength.<br>
The present invention is applicable to all kinds of polypropylene and polypropylene compositions comprising isotactic polypropylene. The isotacticity of polypropylene can be determined either by "C-NMR or by Infrared spectroscopy. When it is determined by ^^C-NMR, the isotacticity is determined as triade percentage (mm%) or as pentade percentage (mmmm%). For the used isotactic polypropylenes of the invention the tirade percentage (mm%) is typically &gt;80%, preferably &gt;90%, still higher values (e.g. &gt;95%) being still more prefenred. Particularly, the present invention is applicable to lypropylenes selected from the group consisting of propylene homopolymers, propylene random copolymers, propylene heterophasic copolymers and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The polypropylene in accordance with the present invention typically has an MFR of from 0.05 to 10 g/10 min at 230 "0/2.16 kg. Depending on the desired end use, the MFR may preferably be in the range of from 0.1 to 5 g/10 min and in embödiments the present invention contemplates MFR values of from 0.1 to 1 g/10 min, in particular for use in pipe applications or MFR values of from 2 to 3 g/10 min for the pneparation of articles prepared by molding operations.<br>
The polypropylene in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by using conventional catalysts,. including Ziegier-Natta catalysts and single site catalysts (induding metallocenes), which may be supported catalysts. Typical Ziegler-Natta catalysts are disclosed in e.g. WO 03/042260, incorporated herein by reference with respect to the description of catalyst components and polymerisation conditions.<br>
Preparation of polypropylenes<br>
Production of propylene homopolymer and of propylene random copolymer<br>
The polymerisation process for the production of the random propylene copolymers according to the invention may be a continuous process or a batch process utiiising known methods and operating in liquid phase, optionally in the presence of an inert diluent, or in gas phase or by mixed liquid-gas techniques.<br>
Accordingly, the random propylene copolymer may be produced by single- or multistage process polymerisation of propylene and a-olefin and/or ethylene such as bulk polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation, slurry polymerisation, solution polymerisation or combinations thereof using conventional catalysts. Preferably, the copolymer is made either in one or two loop reactor(s) or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactor. Those processes are well known to one skilled in the art<br>
The process is preferably canied out in the presence of a catalyst system which is stereospecific for polymerising isotactic polypropylene.<br>
A suitable catalyst for the polymerisation of the propylene polymer is any stereospecific catalyst for propylene polymerisation which is capable of polymerising and copolymerising propylene and a-olefin-comonomers at a temperature of 40 to 110'C and at a pressure from 10 to 100 bar. Ziegler Natta catalysts as well as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts. One skilled in the art is aware of the various possibilities to produce propylene homo- and copolymers and will simply find out a suitable procedure to pn^duce suitable polymers which<br><br>
are used in the present invention, see e.g. Nello Pasquini (Ed.) Polypropyiene Handbook, Hanser, Munich, 2005, pages 15 -141.<br>
The precise control of the polymerisation conditions and reaction parameters is within the<br>
state C7f the art After the polymerisation in the first and the optional second reactor is<br>
finished, the polymer product is recovered by conventional procedures.<br>
The resulting polymer particles may be palletized in a conventional compounding extnjder<br>
with various additives, which are generally used in thermoplastic polymer compositions, such<br>
as stabilisers, antioxidants, acid neutralizing agents, ultraviolet absorbers, antistatic agents,<br>
etc.<br>
Production of propylene homopolymer may be performed in an analogous manner, with the exception, that no comonomer (ethylene) is used in the polymerisation. Heterophasic propylene copolymer<br>
A heterophasic copolymer may be produced by multistage process polymerisation of propylene and ethylene and/or an lobefin such as bulk polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation, slurry polymerisation, solution polymerisation or combinations thereof using conventional catalysts. Those processes are also well known to one skilied in the art.<br>
A preferred process is a combination of a bulk slurry loop reactor(s) and gas phase reactor(s), A matrix polymer can be made either in loop reactors or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactor.<br>
The polymer produced in this way is transferred into another reactor and the disperse phase, an ethylene/a-olefin rubber, is polymerised. Preferably this polymerisation step is done in a gas phase polymerisation.<br>
A suitable catalyst for the polymerisation of a heterophasic propylene copolymer is any stereospecific catalyst for propylene polymerisation which is capable of polymerising and copolymerising propylene and comonomers at a temperature of 40 to 110 °C and at a pressure form 10 to 100 bar. Ziegler Natta catalysts as well as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts.<br>
One skilied in the ari is aware of the various possibilities to produce such heterophasic systems and will simply find out a suitable procedure to produce suitable heterophasic copolymers which can be used in the present invention.<br><br>
A heterophasic polyolefin composition may also be produced by mixing and melt Wending a propylene homopolymer with an ethylene/α-olefin rubber.<br>
According to the present invention, the polypropylene cx)mposition has a high amount of polypropylene crystallized in the  β  -modification. Preferabiy, the amount of p-crystallinity of the potypropylene composition is at least 60%, more preferabiy at least 70%, more preferabiy at least 75%.<br>

Ethylene content in polypropylene was measured by Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A thin film of the sample (thickness approximately 250 urn) was prepared by hot-pressing. The area of -CHa- absorption peak (800 - 650 cm-1) was measured with Perkin Elmer FTIR 1600-spectrometer. The method was calibrated by ethylene content data measured by 13C NMR.<br>
Determination of B-crystallinity<br>
The ft-crystallinity was detemiined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC was run according to ISO 3146 / part 3 / method C2 with a scan rate of 10 "C/min. The amount of (i-modification was calculated from the second heat by the foilowing formula:<br>
β-area / (α-area + β-area)<br>
Since the thennodynamically instable β-modification starts to be changed into the more stable a-modification at temperatures above 150 "C, a part of the β-modification is transferred within the heating process of DSC-measurement. Therefore the amount of p-PP determined by DSC is lower as when measured according to the method of Tumer-Jones by WAXS (A. Tumer-Jones et. al., Makromol. Chem 75 (1964) 134).<br>
"Second heat" means, that the sample is heated according to ISO 3146 / part 3 / method C2 for a first time and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 20 "C/min. The sample is then heated a second time, also according to ISO 3146 / part 3 / method C2. This second heat is relevant for measurement and calculation.<br>
During the "first heat" all thermal history of the sample giving rise to different crystalline structure, which typically comes from different processing conditions and/or methods, is destroyed. By using the second heat for determination of B-crystallinity, it is possible to compare samples regardiess of the way the samples were originally manufactured.<br><br>
Pipe falling weight impact is determined according to EN 1411 on diameter 32 mm pipes with a wall thickness of 4.4 mm at 0°C. The H50 value in millimeters is calculated.<br>
Production of the Pipes<br>
The pipes were produced by feeding the Polypropylene composition In pellet form into a<br>
conventional Cincinnati pipe extaider for extaision with a line speed of about 1 m/min into diameter 32 mm pipes with a wail thickness of 4.4 mm.<br>
