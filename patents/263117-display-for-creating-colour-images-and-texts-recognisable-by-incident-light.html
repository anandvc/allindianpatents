Display for Creating Colour Images and Texts Recognisable by Incident Light<br>
Technical Field<br>
[001] The invention pertains to a display for creating colour images and texts<br>
recognisable by incident light, in which the image area consists of numerous<br>
electronically controllable pixels in a raster-like arrangement and in which<br>
each pixel has at least three colour levels arranged beside one another (side by<br>
side) or behind one another (back to back) for the colours red, green, blue or<br>
cyan, magenta, yellow that are formed by flat transparent containers and<br>
whose inner chambers are connected to colour reservoirs whose content can be<br>
moved by electronic control in such a way that transparent colour fluids is fed<br>
from the colour reservoirs into the colour levels or from the colour levels into<br>
the colour reservoirs.<br>
[002] Displays of this type are known from US 6,037,955, US 6,747,777 and EP 1<br>
090 384. With these displays illuminated from outside by sunlight, daylight or<br>
lamps there is also the desire - depending on location and time of day to<br>
illuminated the image formed by the pixels also from the back. Therefore, in<br>
EP 1 090 384 it is already suggested that one or more light sources be arranged<br>
behind the colour levels made of transparent material and in front of the colour<br>
reservoirs, so that the image formed by the pixels is also visible in darkness.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
[003] It is the task of this invention to create a colour display, in which there is the<br>
possibility, with incident light particularly daylight, to optically highlight<br>
and/or colour-wise alter parts of the image formed by the controlled pixels.<br>
[004] This task is fulfilled according to the invention, in that light sources are<br>
arranged behind the colour levels of the pixels, each of the light sources being<br>
allocated to one pixel and being individually electronically controllable.<br>
[005] With the help of these light sources parts of the image illuminated by daylight<br>
can be optically highlighted or altered in their colours. The colour mixing can<br><br>
2<br>
take place as in a colour TV by additive mixing of the three basic colours<br>
red, green blue, or as in the case of colour photography ■-■ by subtractive<br>
mixing of the colours yellow, magenta, and cyan.<br>
[006] The light sources allocated to the pixels could especially be white light<br>
emitting diodes.<br>
[007] The light sources could however also consist of plane illuminating bodies that<br>
illuminate a larger number of pixels from the back and of masks arranged<br>
between the illuminating bodies and the colour levels of the pixels, which can<br>
be controlled for each pixel in such a way that the light passage through the<br>
mask is open for each pixel or more or less closed.<br>
[008] For backlighting of a larger pixel field, particularly illuminating device as<br>
known in flat screens arc suitable, which consist of a rectangular or quadratic<br>
light-conducting illuminating surface covering the pixel field and light<br>
emitting diodes (LEDs) or cathode ray tubes arranged on the side edges of the<br>
illuminating surface.<br>
1009] The masks can be formed by polarisation filters, whose light passage can be<br>
controlled for each pixel with the help of electronic fields. Two polarisation<br>
filters can be arranged and controlled in such a way that they block passage of<br>
all planes of polarisation of the light. The polarisation filters are foil-type and<br>
can be placed directly on the illuminating surface.<br>
[010] So that the colour levels can give an as brilliant image as possible with<br>
incident daylight, a white or silvery but non-reflective reflection layer, that is<br>
partially or temporarily light-permeable, is arranged behind the layer of the<br>
colour level. The reflection layer can be formed by a milky-turbid glass<br>
surface or plastic foil, or by a glass pane or plastic foil that is provided with a<br>
mat, white or silvery structure.<br>
[011] For improving the reflection of incident light and for improving the light-<br>
permeability of the backlighting a reflection layer is suggested that contains<br><br>
leaf-shaped white or silvery pigments, and the pigments can be aligned<br>
parallel to the layer plane or perpendicular to it by means of an electrical or<br>
magnetic field. The swimming leaf-shaped pigments distributed uniformly in a<br>
fluid form a good reflection layer when they are aligned parallel to the layer<br>
plane, and this layer is largely light-permeable when the leaf structure of the<br>
pigments extends perpendicular to the reflection plane.<br>
[012] However, the reflection layer can also be formed from one flat container made<br>
of transparent material that is filled with a white or silvery colour, when this<br>
layer is not supposed to reflect, and is filled with a clear transparent fluid when<br>
it is supposed to be light-permeable.<br>
[013] The flat containers filled with white or silvery colour fluid or with colourless<br>
fluid can be arranged behind a pixel field or even as fourth colour level for<br>
each pixel. In both cases, the display can be switched over from day operation<br>
to night operation by changing the white or silvery reflection layer to a light-<br>
permeable layer allowing backlighting.<br>
Brief description of drawings<br>
[014] In the following description design embodiments of the invention are<br>
explained in more details on the basis of drawings.<br>
[015] Fig. 1 shows a sectional view of a portion of the display according to the<br>
invention.<br>
[016] Fig. 2 shows a top view on eight pixels of the display shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[017] Fig. 3 shows a sectional view of a pixel field with flat backlighting.<br>
[018] Each pixel 1 of the display has three colour level layers 2, 2', 2" with an<br>
upper colour level 3, a central colour level 3' and a rear colour level 3". The<br>
colour levels 3, 3', 3" are flat containers made of transparent material that are<br>
connected to colour reservoirs through channels 8, 8', 8" and 9, 9\ 9".<br><br>
4<br>
Transparent colour fluids of the colours CYAN, MAGENTA and YELLOW<br>
(CMY) or RED, GREEN, BLUE (RGB) can be moved out of the colour<br>
reservoirs into the colour levels 3, 3\ 3" and back into the colour reservoirs.<br>
The colour fluid can be moved back and forth against an air cushion, or it can<br>
be moved along with a non-mixable colourless fluid in a closed loop or back<br>
and forth. If the colour levels 3, 3', 3", the channels 8, 8', 8" and 9, 9', 9" as<br>
well as the corresponding colour reservoir are partly filled with a colour fluid<br>
and partly with a colourless fluid that is non-mixable with the colour fluid, and<br>
transportation of the colour fluid and the colourless fluid takes place in the<br>
known method by means of electro-wetting (US 6,037,955) or by means of<br>
another micro-pump, then the colour fluids can be fed to the colour levels 3,<br>
3', 3" through the channels 8, 8', 8" and simultaneously the colourless fluid<br>
can be drained from the colour levels 3, 3', 3" through the channels 9, 9'. 9" or<br>
vice-versa. Behind the colour levels 3, 3', 3" of each pixel 1 a light source 6 is<br>
arranged, in particular a white emitting LED. This light source can be<br>
switched on and off independent of the other light sources 6 and, if required,<br>
can also be controlled in light intensity. These light sources are fixed on a<br>
carrier plate 7.<br>
[019] Behind the colour levels and in front of the light sources 6 there is a light-<br>
permeating white or silvery reflection layer 5, which can be formed by a<br>
plastic foil or a thin glass pane and whose light-permeability is at least 40%.<br>
[020] According to Fig. 3 the reflection layer can also be formed by a flat container<br>
5', in which leaf-shaped silvery pigments swim in a fluid, which can be<br>
aligned parallel to the layer or perpendicular to it.<br>
[021] This flat container 5' covering one pixel field can however also be connected<br>
to a system that is filled with two fluids that cannot be mixed with one<br>
another. One fluid is a white or silvery colour fluid and the other fluid is<br>
colourless fluid or a colourless gas. With the help of electro-wetting or a<br>
micro-pump the fluids can be moved in such a way that the transparent flat<br>
container is filled only with white or silvery colour, or only with the colourless<br>
clear transparent fluid, depending on whether this layer is supposed to reflect<br><br>
5<br>
the incident light or is supposed to allow the back-illuminating light to pass<br>
through.<br>
[022] The colour reservoirs (not shown) are arranged behind the reflection layer, so<br>
that the colour fluids can be moved out of the visible range of the person<br>
observing the display.<br>
[023] In Fig. 3 the light sources allocated to the pixels consist of a plane illuminating<br>
device that consists of a light-conducting luminous surface 12, on whose side<br>
edges cathode ray tubes 13 or light emitting diodes are arranged, and two<br>
polarisation filters 14, 15 serving as masks.<br>
[024] The size of the pixels 1 is dependent on the size of the display and the distance<br>
of the observer from this display and lies in the range of 0.5 mm2 to 16 mm2,<br>
that in case of a quadratic pixel conforms to a pixel width of 0.7 to 4 mm.<br>
[025] The channels 8, 9; 8", 9' and 8", 9" leading from the colour reservoirs behind<br>
the reflection layer to the colour levels 3, 3', 3" are worked into the webs 10<br>
that separate the pixels 1 or their colour levels 3, 3', 3" from one another and<br>
that rest with their surface against under face of the cover layer 4 as well as lie<br>
against the front and middle colour level layer 2 and T and are tightly welded<br>
or affixed on to them.<br>
