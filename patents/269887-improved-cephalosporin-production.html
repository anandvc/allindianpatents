				<td>IMPROVED CEPHALOSPORIN PRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to the fermentative production of a cephalosporin in a microorganism.<br>
The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is a natural producer of p-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin-G. In the last decades, penicillin-G production capabilities were highly improved by classical strain improvement, resulting in powerful industrial production strains. Recently, by means of metabolic pathway engineering, several routes for cephalosporin production were successfully integrated in penicillin production strains, in particular Penicillium chrysogenum. In EP-A-0532341, Penicillium chrysogenum has been transformed with the Streptomyces clavuligerus cefE gene encoding an expandase which enables the transformed strain to produce adipyl-7-ADCA (adipyl-7-amino-3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid) when cultured in the presence of the precursor adipic acid. In EP-A-0540210, in addition to the Streptomyces clavuligerus cefE gene, Penicillium chrysogenum has been transformed with a hydroxylase gene whose expression product converts the 3-methyl side chain of adipyl-7-ADCA to 3-hydroxymethyl, to give adipyl-7-aminodeacetylcephalosporanic acid (adipyl-7-ADAC); in another example in EP-A-0540210 Penicillium chrysogenum, already transformed with genes encoding expandase and hydroxylase, is further transformed with an acetyltransferase-gene whose expression product converts the 3-hydroxymethyl side chain to the 3-acetyloxymethyl side chain to give adipyl-7-ACA. In WO2004/106347, a strain of Penicillium chrysogenum has been transformed with genes encoding an expandase, a hydroxylase and an O-carbamoyl transferase enzyme resulting in adipyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.<br>
Industrial strains of Penicillium chrysogenum have been selected for their capacity to produce and secrete large quantities of a variety of beta-lactam compounds, in particular penicillin G and penicillin V, into the culture medium. Various lines of evidence indicate that beta-lactam secretion is an active process, possibly via transport proteins. During the latter stages of such fermentation processes extremely high beta-lactam liters are found in fermentations on an industrial scale. WO01/32904 discloses several ABC-transporter polypeptides that are involved in the secretion of penicillin G. Enhancing an ABC transporter activity resulted in an enhanced secretion of the beta-lactam compound.<br>
The production of cephalosporin molecules in naturally non-cephalosporin recombinant production hosts such as the Penicillium strains discussed hereinbefore still imposes several problems. For example, the secretion level of the desired compounds is still relatively low and must be increased in order to be both technically and economically more attractive. The production rate of cephalosporins produced in P. chrysogenum will be limited due to the fact that the penicillin transporters, i.e. the ABC transporter polypeptides, will have a low affinity for the cephalosporin compound. It has been suggested in W001/32904 that this could be overcome by cloning one or more homologous ABC transporter polypeptides, from natural cephalosporin producers such as Acremonium chrysogenum using the polynucleotides encoding the ABC-transporters disclosed in WO01/32904.<br>
The filamentous fungus Acremonium chrysogenum is a natural producer of cephalosporins such as cephalosporin C. In a particular strain of this fungus, Acremonium chrysogenum C10, a CefT gene has been identified recently which encodes a putative efflux pump protein and, at the same time, significantly increases cephalosporin C production (Ullan et al. (2002) Mol. Genet. Genomics, 267, 673-683; Liras and Martin (2006) International Microbiology 9, 9-19). The nucleotide sequence of the CefT-gene has been deposited in the nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information under accession number (locus) AJ487683. The NCBS can be accessed on the INTERNET at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and the CefT gene nucleotide sequence at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&amp;vaN21214008. From the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the CefT, the authors concluded that it is a transmembrane protein since it has 12 transmembrane segments (TMS) and contains motifs A, B, C, D2 and G characteristic of the Drug:H+ antiporter 12 TMS group of the major facilitator superfamily. The CefT protein confers resistance to some toxic organic acids, including isovaieric acid and phenylacetic acid, as was concluded from the fact that these acids were toxic to an Acremonium strain in which the CefT was made inactive. Overexpression of the homologous CefT gene resulted in an improved cephalosporin C production in Acremonium chrysogenum. This was not the case when a truncated form of the CefT gene was used. However, targeted inactivation of the CefT gene did not affect the cephalosporin C production in Acremonium chrysogenum which suggests that there are redundant systems involved in cephalosporin export in Acremonium chrysogenum.<br>
The CefT protein from Acremonium chrysogenum C10 does not belong to the family of ABC-transporters. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the CefT protein from Acremonium chrysogenum C10 (Lilian et al (2002)) with any of the amino acid sequence of the ABC-transporters disclosed in WO01/32904 reveals that the CefT protein does not have any homology with the ABC transporter proteins (i.e. 
The term "CefT gene" relates to a gene encoding a CefT protein, i.e. a protein involved in the transport of a cephalosporin compound from inside the cephalosporin producing microorganism towards the outside of the cephalosporin producing microorganism. An example of such a CefT gene from the strain Acrymonium chrysogenum C10 can be found in Lilian et al (2002) which also discloses the amino acid sequence of the CefT protein encoded by the CefT-gene.<br>
The term 'heterologous CefT gene' means that the CefT gene may be obtained from any suitable host microorganism and is used to transform a cephalosporin-producing microorganism, with the proviso that the suitable host microorganism from which the CefT gene is derived is not the same species as the cephalosporin-producing microorganism transformed with the CefT gene.<br>
The term 'homologous CefT gene" means that CefT gene is obtained from and any suitable host microorganism and used to transform a cephalosporin-producing microorganism, proviso that the suitable host microorganism from which the CefT gene is derived is the same species as the cephalosporin-producing microorganism transformed with the CefT gene. Transformation of the strain Acrymonium chrysogenum C10 with a homologous CefT gene originating from the same strain Acrymonium chrysogenum C10 has been described by Ullan et al. (2002).<br>
The term 'homology' refers to the identity of the sequence of a first gene, protein or enzyme with the sequence of a second gene, protein or enzyme. Throughout this description, the degree of homology is expressed as a percentage of identity with a reference gene, protein or enzyme. Determining these homologies can be performed by methods known to the skilled man, for instance by using the protein sequence of the reference protein as a "query sequence" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using BLAST programs (version 2.2) using the default parameters of the respective program. See for instance http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a cephalosporin-producing micro¬organism characterized in that it has been transformed with a heterologous CefT gene<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
General materials and methods<br>
Standard procedures were carried out as described in Sambrook, J. et al. (1989), Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. DNA was amplified using the proofreading polymerases Turbo-Pfu-Polymerase or Herculase (Stratagene, The Netherlands), following the manufacturers protocol, while the verification of constructed strains and plasmids was achieved by using Taq polymerase. Restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs. For routine cloning, Escherichia coli strains TopIO and DH10B<br><br>
 (Invitrogen) were employed. Verification of the constructed plasmids was carried out by restriction analysis and subsequent sequencing (Seqlab GmbH, Goettingen, Germany).<br>
The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 (ATCC 28089) was used as a host for genetic modification and production strain construction.<br>
Example 1 Construction of the CefTexpression cassette for transformation in Penicillium<br>
chrysogenum<br>
Escherichia coli DH5a was used as host strain for high frequency transformation, plasmid DNA amplification (Sambrook, 1989) and plasmid construction using the Multisite Gateway® Three-Fragment Vector Construction Kit of Invitrogen with different vectors. Vector pDONR™ P4-P1R was used for cloning of the promotor region of 920bp upstream of the pcbC gene. The attB4F site was added by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using primer attB4-F-IPNS and the attBIR site was added with primer attB1-R-IPNS. The amplified PCR product was cloned into pDONR™ P4-P1R using BP clonase creating pDONR™ P4-P1R-IPNS promotor. Vector pDONR™ 201 gateway vector was used to clone the CefT gene of Acremonium chrysogenum (acCefT). The attBIF site was added by PCR using primer attBIF-AcCefT and the attB2R site was added using attB2R-AcCefT-minus-Stop. The amplified AcCefT gene was cloned into pDONR™ 201 using BP clonase yielding pDONR™ 201-AcCefT. The stop codon of the AcCefT was removed to enable fusions with a His-tag or GFP-tag at the carboxyl terminal site of the gene. To add the attB2F site to the terminator region of 551 bp downstream of the penDE gene for cloning in the pDONR™ P2R-P3 primer attB2F-His8x-Tat was used. Together with primer attB3R-Tat the terminator region was cloned and a HIS-tag with a stop codon was added to create vector pDONR™ P2-P3R-HIS-Tat. To obtain a carboxyl-terminal fusion with GFP primers attB2R-GFP and attB3R-Tat were used to create vector pDONR™ P2-P3R-GFP-Tat.<br>
Combining these pDONR™ vectors in the pDEST™ R4-R3 in the LR reaction of the Multisite Gateway® Three-Fragment Vector Construction Kit a destination vector was made with respectively the PcbC promotor, AcCefT gene, His- or GFP-tag and the terminator of the PenDE gene.<br>

Transformation of Penicillium chrysogenum ATCC 28089 CefE/CefF/CmcH (construction described in WO2004106347) with the CefTexpression cassette<br>
designed in Example 1<br>
For the transformation experiments of Penicillium chrysogenum ATCC 28089 CefE/CefF/CmcH a strain was used that produced circa 0.3 g/L adipyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. Protoplasts of were made and isolated and transformation (Alvarez, 1987) was done by co-transformation of the pDEST™ P4-R3 vector with pcbC promotor, CefT gene and penDE terminator and the AMDS-gene used as selection marker on plates with acetamide as sole Nitrogen source. Total RNA of transformants was isolated using Trizol® (Invitrogen) and positive transformants were determined with RT-PCR beads (Amersham) using a AcCefT specific primer (AcCefT F1; 5'-TCGATTCGTACCAGCACCAGGC-3') and a attB2 - HIS-tag primer (5-TGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGACCACTT-31) to obtain a PCR fragment of 384bp.<br>

Cultivation of Penicillium chrysogenum ATCC 28089 CefE/CefF/CmcH CefT and measurement of adipyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic<br>
acid secretion<br>
Mycelium of 5 CefT transformants was inoculated in a 50 ml shake flask in mineral medium containing (g/L): glucose (5); lactose (80); urea (4.5); (NH4)2SO4 (1.1); Na2SO4 (2.9); KH2P04 (5.2); K2HPO4 (4.8) and 10 mL/L of a trace element solution A containing citric acid (150); FeSO4.7H2O (15); MgSO4.7H2O (150); H3BO3 (0.0075); CuSO4.5H2O (0.24); CoSO4.7H2O (0.375); ZnSO4.7H2O (5); MnSO4.H2O (2.28); CaCI2.2H2O (0.99); 3 g/L adipic acid; pH before sterilization 6.5. After 7 days growth at 25°C, 280 rpm, cells were pelleted and the supernatant was analyzed using NMR for the formation of cephalosporins. See table 2 for the results. The data clearly show the positive effect of CefT gene integration in the genomes of P. chrysogenum on cephalosporin production.<br>
