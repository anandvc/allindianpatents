3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for treating lignoceflulosic material, and in particular involves the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of impregnated wood chips to partially de-polymerize the lignin matrix with subsequent distillation, condensation and recovery of the acid catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior art processes for treating lignocellulosic material often require high temperatures and pressures to ensure the chemical reactions proceed at a sufficient rate. As a result, special pressure vessels and specialized equipment is necessary to withstand the harsh conditions. This makes processing facilities very expensive to outfit and maintain, as well as being expensive to operate, with high energy demands,<br>
In addition, strong chemicals are generally required to produce the desired oxidation or reduction reaction. The chemicals attack the equipment as well as the lignoceflulosic material, again increasing maintenance costs for the facility. Once used, the chemicals must be disposed of, creating potential environmental hazards and pollution. Even water used during the treatment process can become contaminated and require careful handling to prevent pollution and environmental damage. Fresh chemicals must then be purchased to replace those tost during.the treatment process.<br>
Most processing facilities, despite the expensive, sophisticated equipment in place, can only be used to process a limited selection of plant material. . Different plant<br>
2<br><br>
materials require different processing conditions and chemicals, and occasionally different processing methods, meaning other plant materials cannot be processed without a complete re-tooling of the process line, if at all. It is preferable to be able to process many types of vegetation without the need to re-tool or change the facility equipment.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a process for treating lignocellulosic material which overcomes the above limitations and provides other desirable features.<br>
This and other objects of the invention will be appreciated by reference to the summary of the invention and to the detailed description of the preferred embodiment that follow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is a continuous and batch system to produce cellulose, native lignin and unicellular protein from any form of vegetation in a closed process.<br>
The hydrolytic Catalytic Reactor Process (CRP) produces commercial grade pulp and separates sweet liquor (sugars and hemi cellulose) from native form lignin - a natural lignin not altered by high temperatures or adverse process conditions. The sweet liquor is further.converted to a unicellular protein which can be converted to many different products. The process's waters and the catalytic chemicals are recycled.<br>
The crux of the CRP process is the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of impregnated wood chips. The acid catalyst effects the partial de-polymerization of the lignin matrix in the chemical reactor with subsequent distillation, condensation and recovery of the acid catalyst and recovery of native-form lignin. Much of the prior art.in the field uses reduction/oxidation chemical reaction mechanisms. This basic difference in reaction mechanism allows for significant advantages of the CRP process.<br>
3<br><br>
For example, the vegetation is impregnated in a solution of nitric acid and/or ammonium hydroxide and water. After a period of time at room temperature and atmospheric pressure the chemical solution is recycled. The biomass is then moved to a catalytic reactor and heated. Evaporated impregnate is recovered via an absorption tower and is recycled back to chemical solution. The biomass is moved to an alkaline solution before being cooled to separate pulp from black liquor. The pulp may be processed as desired to produce saleable products. Black liquor is pumped to separation tank and is treated to precipitate lignin. The solution is filtered to separate sweet liquor and lignin. The lignin is dried1 and the sweet liquor is fennented to produce unicellular protein.<br>
The process can utilize any species of plant including hardwoods, softwoods, shrubs, grain species, grasses etc. The process can utilize sawdust as the sole starting material (something that cannot be done commercially or specifically stated in patents examined to date).<br>
The quality and quantity of lignin produced dictates the reaction conditions throughout the process. A distinct advantage is the elimination of "dry" raw materials. Indeed, green starting material can be utilized and is even preferred for the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the native lignin polymer depending on the quantity of pulp, lignin and sweet liquor required.<br>
The CRP pulping process does not require added pressure at any stage nor temperature ranges anywhere near those of traditional Kraft pulping processes. Basically, all temperatures at various stages of the process are below 90°C and no external pressure is added to the reaction system.<br>
The CRP pulping process is a closed system where virtually all chemicals used are recovered for reuse. Water used in the pulping process is recovered in saleable by¬products, filtered for reuse or vented as steam. The vented steam could be used in providing energy for the pulping process thereby eliminating even this small loss of water and a potential energy source. The recovery of catalytic chemicals eliminates the need for high chemical cost during each cycle of the pulping process.<br>
4<br><br>
A small amount of chemicals are needed to bring back to strength each recovered chemical before being re-introduced into the process. The recovery of chemicals does not require external energy expense to achieve this (unlike current recovery stages in Kraft mills).<br>
By using this novel process the following benefits are achieved:<br>
1.	Wet starting materials can be used - if is not necessary to dry the chips as the water is essential to the hydrolysis.<br>
2.	Hydrolysis uses low temps, low pressures and little energy input.<br>
3.	Weak acids and bases are used, minimizing raw material costs and degradation of final products.<br>
4.	.  The acid catalysts are distilled and recycled allowing closed.cycles.<br>
5.	The chemical reactor pulping process is essentially pollution free. .<br>
6.	The chemical reactor pulping process.gives a high yield of native Klason lignin.<br>
7.	The chemical reactor pulp yield of alpha cellulose is high.<br>
8.	The sweet liquor after precipitation is suitable for fermentation of unicellular protein.<br>
9.	The chemical reactor process is scalable with suitable mixer designs and when combined with the projected operating cost gives a return on construction investment of less than 2 years.<br>
10.	The chemical reactor process is highly efficient with costs half that of typical Kraft mills..<br>
This results in the use of radically lower concentrations of acids and base during the impregnation and digestion stages as well as significantly lower temperatures.<br>
Since the CRP pulping process is a closed system with virtually zero discharge of chemicals or water into the environment, a mil! utilizing this process will easily meet and exceed current environmental standards. Bearing this in mind, a pollutant-free-pulp mill could also garner tremendous profit potential under an EPA carbon dioxide pollution credit system.<br>
5<br><br>
The ability to process a wide variety of vegetation without any re-tooling gives flexibility in pulp production. Currently, mills are designed to produce specific pulp types and utilize specific wood species as raw materials. Furthermore, most mills require chips meeting stringent quality specifications. These limitations are avoided by the invention.<br>
The economic viability of the CRP pulp process may be realized in the sale of pulp alone. Other benefits are potential EPA credits and the production of native lignin products and of unicellular protein for sale to others. It is noted that unicellular protein from a vegetative source would be free of any BSE pathogens and would be the preferred feed for cattle and other livestock animals presently raised for human consumption.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF,THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic of the preferred embodiment of the process. Chips from infeed 2 are placed in impregnating chamber 4 along with an impregnate solution. After the chips have soaked for an appropriate amount of time, excess impregnate is removed and cleaned, such as by filter mechanism 6 and collected in recovery tank 10. It is then strengthened and returned, such as by pump 12, to impregnating chamber 4.<br>
8<br><br>
Meanwhile, the impregnated chips are moved by appropriate means, such as auger mechanism 8, to catalytic reactor 20. To control the feed of chips from impregnating chamber 4 to the catalytic reactor 20, various mechanisms may be used. In the preferred embodiment, holding tank 14 holds the impregnated chips until they may be fed through hopper 16 into measurement device 18. Measurement device 18 then controls the feed rate of chips into catalytic reactor 20.<br>
In catalytic reactor 20, the chips are heated by heater 22 to a temperature above the evaporation temperature of the impregnate, but sufficiently low that the properties of the iignin compounds formed are not compromised. The chips are also agitated to ensure thorough heating of the biomass.<br>
Evaporated impregnate is removed from catalytic reactor 20 by a mechanism such as pump 24'and collected in a condensing chamber or absorption tower 26. The impregnate is condensed and returned to recovery tank 10 for reuse in impregnating chamber 4.<br>
Outfeed 28 passes the catalyzed biomass into the digester 30, where the biomass is mixed with an alkaline solution,- The mixture is heated and agitated in the presence of black iron to produce black liquor and pulp.<br>
Excess black liquor is removed from the digested pulp by means such as press 32, Removed-black liquor is collected in tank 34 and returned to digester 30, such as by pump 36, The pressed pulp is processed, such as by washer 38, as required.<br>
Black liquor passes from digester 30 to Iignin tank 40, where it is cooled, agitated and acidified to precipitate Iignin, thereby forming sweet liquor and Iignin.<br>
The sweet liquor and Iignin pass through a separation device, such as filter 42, where the Iignin is collected for further processing. The sweet liquor passes through the filter 42 into fermentation tank 44.<br>
9<br><br>
In fermentation tank 44, bacteria is added to the sweet liquor to produce unicellular protein, which may then be processed as necessary.<br>
The following describes the process according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. The process is shown schematically in the flowcharts of Figures 3 and 4, for nitric acid impregnate and ammonium hydroxide impregnate, respectively.<br>
1.	Raw material is prepared by chopping plant species into convenient lengths of hard and soft woods into chips approximately the size of existing commercially available chips in use today. However, smaller chips can be used due to the longer fiber lengths produced from the weaker chemicals and lower temperatures used in the CRP process.<br>
2.	The raw material'is loaded into an impregnation chamber 4 and saturated with an impregnate: The impregnate may be nitric acid, ammonium hydroxide and.or both. For example, if the raw material Is hardwood and nitric acid is used, the chips may be soaked in 15% HN03 for 18 hours. If the raw material is softwood or other vegetation, they are soaked in 12% HN03 for 16 hours. If the impregnate is ammonium hydroxide, the chips are soaked in 10% NH^OH regardless of the raw materials.<br>
3.	Excess impregnate is drained off, filtered and brought back to strength for reuse in recovery tank 10.<br>
4.	The impregnated material is transferred to the catalytic reactor 20 at a pH of 2 to 5. At this stage, temperature is maintained between 60°C and 85°C for a maximum of 80 minutes. It is important that the catalytic reactor 20 be kept within this optimaltemperature and time range to produce high yields and quality of the finished products, especially unaltered lignin compounds. If the material is kept beyond the optimum time, then excessive, material oxidization occurs rather than the preferred catalytic hydrolyzation of the lignin polymer, thus inhibiting the subsequent stages. Heating impregnated materials beyond the optimum temperature also leads to reduced yields and alters the desired state of lignin (rendering an inferior gummy product).  The times held at optimum temperature<br>
10<br><br>
range from 10 to 80 minutes depending on the raw materials used. The chemical reaction taking place during the catalytic reaction step is shown in Figure 2.<br>
During the heating of the impregnated material, impregnate is released in a vapor form, withdrawn and sent to a condensing chamber or absorption tower 26 where it is collected for reuse. After a sufficient time, the lignin is catalytically hydrolyzed to the desired molecular state and the raw materia! is now ready to be passed to the alkaline bath stage.<br>
In this catalytic stage, agitation is important as in a large reactor there would not be sufficient time to thoroughly heat the entire mass of impregnated material before passing onto the alkaline digesting stage, thus affecting both yield and . quality of final products.<br>
5.  Caustic soda, is added to the. material passed from the catalytic reactor 20 in the digester 30. The caustic soda strength is as follows:<br>
4L of 20% NaOH to 200L of water rf the starting raw material is hardwood; 4L of 15% .NaOH to 200L of water if starting raw material is softwood or other plant species.<br>
The alkaline bath is heated to an optimum temperature range of 60 - 85°C for a time period of 60 minutes. During this alkaline stage, at a pH of 9 to 12, the mixture is agitated in the presence of black iron and there is a separation of the pulp from the black liquor. The pulp passes through screeners and a press that extract any black liquor. The black liquor is recycled back into the alkaline digester. i"Once all the pulp has been removed from the alkaline bath, it is washed and dried and the remaining black liquor is returned to the digester 30, then is passed info the ligniri tank 40.<br>
Photos of fibers obtained through the process, using various starting materials are shown in Figure 6. Properties of the CRP pulp at this stage are shown in Table 1.<br>

6.	The black liquor is passed into the lignin tank 40 and rapidly cooled to a temperature range of 43-50°C (this is important to maintain the native state of the lignin). At this point, 10% sulfuric acid is added to the black liquor if the impregnate was nitric acid; 12% hydrochloric acid is added if the impregnate was ammonium hydroxide. The ratio of sulfuric acid to black liquor is 2L acid to 200L black liquor at a pH of 2 to 5. The agitators are started to precipitate the lignin from -the- black liquor before the mixture cools below 43?C. The separation process takes about 1 hour.<br>
7.	From the lignin tank 40, the; sweet liquor and precipitated lignin mixture is released into a fermentation tank. The sweet liquor passes through a filter 42 while the lignin powder remains on top of the filter. The native lignin is carried to a dryer where it is dried at a temperature range of 43-50°C. Deviation from this range destroys the native lignin state. Properties of the native lignin are shown in Table 2.<br>
12<br><br>
Table 2 - Analysis results of the CRP lignin<br>
Component	Sample 1        Sample 2<br>
Klason Lignin %	83.0	76.7<br>
8. To the fermentation tank 44, a bacteria (torula) is added to the sweet liquor to activate the fermentation process. Once the fermentation is complete, the unicellular protein is filtered, dried and packaged, or washed to reduce pb and used for other products.<br>
Q. The residual water from the fermentation process is treated and recycled back into the process.<br>
Agitators are used iti the catalytic reactor 20 and digester 30 and are important to • achieving the optimum results, as far as desired yields and quantity of finished product<br>
In the catalytic reactor 20, (he agitators are used to achieve and maintain the optimum temperature ra'nge' for the de-polymerization, of lignin to occur. The optimum temperature must be reached as quickly as possible to avoid undesired oxidization of the lignin. This oxidization will provide for lignin compounds to begin to form from the ketone, aldehyde, and etc, chemical classes, all of which are undesirable. Also, oxidization of the lignin will provide cleaved sites to allow cross-linking between lignin polymers, another undesirable result. Oxidization will result in low yields of native lignin and sweet liquors depending on the extent of the oxidization reaction within the catalytic chamber. The design of the agitators is contingent upon whether a batch process plant, or a continuous feed plant is utilized. The agitators are used to both quickly bring up to temperature the impregnated biomass and begin breaking up the biomass itself.<br>
In a continuous feed plant, agitators in the catalytic reactor 20 will also transfer continuously the impregnated biomass to the alkaline bath or digester 30.<br>
13<br><br>
In the digester 30, the agitators are used to achieve an optimal product yield. If reacted, the biomass is simply dropped into an alkaline solution and allowed to sit, and the surface of the chips will begin to undergo digestion. This will bring Iignin out of the chips and into the alkaline solution. If iignin is left too long in the presence of NaOH, it will begin to oxidize, an unwanted result. Very aggressive agitation is utilized to tear the chips into ever-smaller pieces allowing the NaOH to quickly be utilized before the oxidization of the Iignin begins in significant amounts. The result is sodium motecufes attached to cleavage points on the ffgnfn polymers rendering the Iignin water-soluble.<br>
The agitators also result in homogenous optimum temperature ranges.<br>
The operating conditions of the process are as follows.<br>
To treat 60 kilos of pine chips, the chips are impregnated with 315L of ammoniacal acid solution containing 27.5L of nitric acid and 4L of hydroxide of ammonia.<br>
After 12 hours of impregnation, the add solution is withdrawn for later re-circulation and the chips are placed in the reactor to effect the reaction of catalytic hydrolysis at temperature of 755C, maximum SOX during the time of 90 minutes; taking into account, when it reaches the temperature of 75°C during the reaction, the gases have recuperated the NOx in water or in recycled acid solutions.<br>
At the end of the reaction,'the chips are discharged in the alkaline bath for de-lignifying the chips, where they are preheated at 75°C in a mixture of 315L of NaOH at 4%.   The reaction of de-lignifying is done at about 80°C and to a maximum of -90°C for 90 minutes.  The heating is then stopped to Jet it cool to 75°C, before the . mixture is processed through a filter to separate the cellulose from the black liquor.<br>
The black liquor is sent to a Iignin tank where it is agitated and the concentrated sulphuric acid is carefully added until the pH is lowered to 3.0. It is left to rest and then passed through a filter to separate the Iignin from the sweet liquor.<br>
14<br><br>
The filtered sweet liquor is sent to a fermentation tank where bacteria may be added to produce a unicellular protein.<br>
At the end of the process, the lignin and cellulose is washed to retrieve the excess of acid and caustic soda respectively, The water that was used for the process is standard faucet or running water.<br>
