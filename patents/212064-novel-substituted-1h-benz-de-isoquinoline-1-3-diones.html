				<td>This invention relates to novel substituted 1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3-diones.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparation of substituted 1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3-diones.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to the 'Synthesis of substituted 1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3-diones as a novel group of anticancer agents'.<br>
The main utility of this invention is to prepare hitherto unknown groups of compounds which may be useful in the treatment of human cancers.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
Despite the advent of other types of chemotherapeutic agents, a number of alkylating agents still retain their key role in several human cancers. Among the alkylating agents, the subclass of nitrosoureas containing the established anti-tumour highly cytotoxic functionality as R - NH - CO - N(NO) - CH2CH2CI best represented by BCNU, CCNU, Me-CCNU, chlorozotocin and also less cytotoxic R - NH - CO - N(NO) -CH2CH3 as streptozotocin which are useful in various human cancers including brain-tumours since these have the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier. Several structural patterns have been used as the carrier molecule for the NU groups. However, literature survey reveals that there are no reports, to our knowledge, in which the substituted naphthalimides have been used as their carrier which was particularly chosen since it has been found that some substituted naphthalimides containing N-{2-dimethylaminoethyl) chain best represented by amonafide and mitonafide have exhibited substantial cytotoxicities in various animal and human tumours and are under clinical trial. Hence the synthesized compounds described in this invention may have synergistic activity since the molecules contain the DNA binder naphthalimide group as well as the highly cytotoxic 2-chloroethylnitrosourea or comparatively less cytotoxic ethylnitrosourea functionalities embedded in it.<br>

According to this invention, the known three step process was followed for preparing 2-chloroethyl nitrosourea or ethyl nitrosourea derivatives of naphthalimides / substituted naphthalimides of formula 1d and 1e respectively. Thus in the first step, amino compounds of formula 1a were obtained from the corresponding naphthalic anhydride / substituted 1,8-naphthalic anhydride derivatives by treating with 1,2-diaminoethane or 1,3-diaminopropane under various reaction conditions. Next compounds of formula 1b or 1c were obtained from the compounds of formula 1a by treating the latter with 2-chloroethyl isocyanate or ethyl isocyanate preferably at room temperature in good yields. Finally compounds of formula 1d or 1e were obtained in good yields from the ureido compounds of formula 1b or 1c by nitrosation with sodium nitrite in the presence of formic acid at a temperature of ORC. By following the above synthetic process, nine new title compound of 1d and eight new title compound of 1e ( n = 2, 3) have been obtained (Table 4 and 5).<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and should not construed to the limit of the scope of the invention.<br>
Synthesis of the title compounds 1<br>
New compounds (Table 1-5) were characterised by PMR spectra measured in a Brucker 300-DPX spectrometer with the solvents as indicated and chemical shifts were expressed in 5 units (ppm) using tetramethyl silane as internal standard. IR and UV spectra were recorded in spectrophotometers as Perkin-Elmer FT-IR model no RX-1 and Shimadzu model no. UV-160A respectively. Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover Unimelt capillary melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. Wherever possible, purity of compounds were checked with Waters HPLC system at ambient temperature (Âµ-bondapak C18 steel column, 30 cm x 3.9 mm; isocratic mobile<br>
phase acetonitrile-water in varying proportions (up to 50 : 50) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min; uv detection at 250 nm). TLC plates coated with silica gel were used.<br>

Studies with such new compounds 1d have demonstrated that they have displayed excellent reproducible activity in two different murine tumours having 'curative effects' and also having comparable results with two standard clinical drugs namely 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cyclophosphamide (endoxan).<br>
Anti - Tumour Screening assay with the compounds<br>
Mice<br>
Closed colony bred Swiss albino male mice of about 6 weeks of age weighing 24 Â± 2 g were used, maintained and divided in two groups as control (untreated) and treated . At least 6 animals were used for a particular group in an experiment.<br>
Vehicle<br>
Physiological saline containing 2% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, Sigma Inc., USA) was used for  drug administration by intraperinoteal (i.p.) route. The drug solutions were administered to the experimental mice through injection. The drug solutions were prepared daily just prior to the injection. Tumour<br>
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma - 180 (S-180) cells obtained from National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, were used. Tumour cell suspensions in physiological saline were prepared to final concentrations of 5 x 106 cells/ml as<br>
described . Mice were inoculated with 1.0 x 106 viable cells/mouse at an injection volume of 0.2 ml on day 0 for in vivo study.<br>
Schedule<br>
In in vivo screening increase in life span (ILS) study against EAC &amp; S-180, groups of mice (6 animals each for treated and control groups) were inoculated. Compounds 1d in respective doses was administered to each mouse in treated groups as per table 6. The control groups received equal volumes of vehicle (0.2 ml) on those days. The testing was evaluated by calculating the median survival time (M.S.T.) of drug-treated (T) tumor-bearing animals compared to untreated control (C) tumour bearing animals and expressed as percent T/C value. A T/C percentage value greater than 125 was considered as significant. Two standard clinical drugs as cyclophosphamide (endoxan) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were used as positive controls for comparison in these tumour systems.<br>
Results and Discussions - Antitumoural screening<br>
The anticancer efficacy of compounds 1d have been assessed in S-180 and EAC by measuring three parameters as the ILS value, ascites cell and ascites fluid. It was found that the highly significant (P 
Compounds 1d have displayed "curative" effects in different schedules since 1-5 /6 tumour bearing animals treated with these compounds survived more than 60 days and got cured while untreated tumour bearing animals have got median survival time of 22 - 26 days (Table 6).<br>
In order to simulate a clinical situation where cancer chemotherapeutic agent is often used at an advanced stage of disease, the efficacy of compounds 1d were also evaluated in different doses in mice bearing EAC and S-180 for 5 days and highly advanced 10 days before the drug challenge. It is interesting to note significant increases in the median survival times in the treated groups with '1-2 'cure's/6 animals having survival rates over 60 days in EAC &amp; S-180 (Table 6). These have also displayed much greater activity than cyclophosphamide (endoxan) in these two tumour<br>
systems when all of them are administered i.p. This may be due to the reason that cyclophosphamide differ from other types of alkylating agents in that it requires a multistep activation process before functioning as an anti-tumour agent. In liver cells the microsomal oxidase system converts it into active metabolites and for cyclophosphamide an oral or intraveneous route is preferred. It is also worthy to note that compounds 1d have displayed comparable ILS values with 5-FU which also displayed 'curative effects' having long term survivors in EAC and S-180.<br>

Reference may be made to the inherent toxicities associated with anticancer drugs in general. Some of the newly invented active compounds have been subjected to the toxicological assay in vivo in normal and tumour-bearing mice at their optimum doses by measuring sequentially drug-induced changes in hematological parameters, femoral bone marrow cellularity and splenic cellularity. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity and<br>
nephrotoxicity were also sequentially evaluated sequentially in normal and tumour-bearing mice but no such toxicities were detected. Toxic symptoms were not observed externally in animals, in terms of their general appearance, in respect of their skin and hair texture and in their behavioural pattern in respect of food and water intake and activity. The internal organs like heart, spleen, liver and kidney all retained their usual distinctive colours and appearances in the treated groups on different days compared with those of normal mice.<br>
Example 1. In vivo Toxiocological assay of 1d ( n = 2, R = 6 - Bromo) in mouse.<br>
The toxicological assay results with the representative compound 1d ( n = 2, R = 6 - Bromo) are described below.<br>
1) Hematoloaical studies<br>
Blood samples were collected from tail veins or by cardiac puncture from just sacrificed animals under exposure to ether for counting erythrocytes, thrombocytes or leukocytes in an improved Neubauer bright field counting chamber by standard procedures using freshly prepared RBC and WBC counting fluids. Differential counts of leucocytes were performed by staining the blood smears with Leishman's stain (pH 6.8) and slides were observed under light microscope. Hemoglobin concentrations were measured by the standard method.<br>
Sera were obtained from blood samples collected as above. Standard methods and reagents were used to measure the serum alkaline phosphatase (SAKP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.<br>
2) Femoral bone marrow cellularity<br>
Mice were sacrificed under exposure to ether and femoral marrow cells were obtained as per standard procedure. Ends of the femur bone were snipped open immediately thereafter with scissors and the marrow plug was flushed out by forcefully injecting cold HBSS (Ca++ and Mg++ free) through the bone cavity by inserting a 26 gauze needle. The marrow plug, was dissociated into single cell suspension by<br>
repeatedly passing this suspension through 22 gauze needle and the total volume was measured.  Total  number of     nucleated  cells     per femur were  counted  in  a hemocytometer after treating the cells with 2% glacial acetic acid. 3) Splenic cellularity<br>
Whole spleen was removed from mice sacrificed under exposure to ether and processed essentially as per the published procedure. The spleen was minced in cold<br>
HBSS (Ca++ and Mg++ free) and the resultant mixture was passed sequentially through 22 gauze needles to make a single cell suspension. The total number of nucleated cells in the spleen was counted in a hemocytometer similarly as in the case of femoral marrow after treatment with 2% glacial acetic acid.<br>
Results - Toxicoloalcal screening<br>
To study the hematological changes associated with the application of the representative compound 1d (n = 2, R = 6 - Bromo) , four parameters - (a) hemoglobin level (b) erythrocyte count (c) leukocyte count (total and differential) and (d) platelet count were determined in the peripheral blood of normal treated (NT) as well as in S-180 tumour bearing mice (treated groups ST ; control groups SC respectively) on days 9, 15 and 21 sequentially following drug administration from day 1 to 7 (dose - 50 mg/kg). The following cellularities namely (e) femoral bone marrow and (f) splenic were also determined in all these groups The detailed data obtained for each parameter in NT, ST and SC groups were expressed in Fig. 1 and 2 as the percent control of the respective values obtained for normal control (NC) mice [Respective values for normal control mice are Hemoglobin - 14.5 gm/dl ; RBC - 7.7 x 106 /ul ; WBC - 8200 /ul ; Platelet - 8.9 x 105 /ul; Femoral bone marrow cell count - 12.2 x 106 /ul ; Splenic cell count-15.2 x107/ul].<br>
From Fig. 1, it is noted that initially there were about 10% decrease in the hemoglobin levels in the NT and ST groups observed on day 9 which gradually tends to reach the NC value at a later stage. In contrast, the hemoglobin concentrations in the SC group was found to decrease gradually with the progression of tumour, a common observation noted earlier in several tumor systems by others.<br><br>
Erythrocyte counts in NT and ST groups fully corroborated the above observation as erythrocyte count fell by 17-20% on day 9 reaching NC value on day 21. Like the hemoglobin content, the erythrocyte counts in the SC group was also found to decrease gradually with the progression of tumours as expected supporting the above and earlier observations. A marked increase in circulating leukocytes was observed to be associated with the growth of different animal tumors including S-180. Similar observations and trends were noted in SC mice. Results from WBC total count reflected that there was no significant decrease or increase in any of the treated groups up to the final day of observation i.e. day 21 (Fig. 1).<br>
Differential counts of leucocytes in peripheral blood smears of all these tumour bearing control mice showed a shift from lymphocytosis, noted in normal mice to a neutrophilia of approximately 70-75% in accordance with earlier observations. Thus we have found the reversal of lymphoid-myeloid ratio from approximately 3:1 for normal mice to approximately 1:3 in SC control group of mice. It was found that in the treated groups the lymphoid-myeloid ratio was in the range of (56-61 % : 33-40 %) which was close to that of NC ratio (71% : 23%).<br>
Platelet counts showed that neither thrombocytosis nor thrombocytopenia occured in the treated groups except slight decrease (10%) from that of NC value was observed initially in ST group on day 9. It is evident that thrombocytosis had occurred in SC group during the progression of tumour.<br>
As revealed from the Fig. 2, it was found that there was slight decrease (13%) in the femoral marrow cell count occurred particularly in the ST group which persisted till day 15. Recovery from the bone marrow suppression was noted within 10-12 days post drug therapy in ST group. During this period, gradual decrease in this cellularity was observed in the SC group.<br>
Hyposplenic cellularity more prounced in the ST group (decrease by 35%) was noted on day 9. After withdrawal of the drug gradual increase in the splenic cellularities were observed in these groups and the normal count was soon reached within day 15-21 (Figure 2). The average spleen weights recorded in the NT and ST groups, however, did not exhibit any such change or decrase. During tumorigenesis under the stress of<br><br>
tumour burden, splenomegaly have been observed in S-180 control group. This trend is also in full agreement with the earlier observations made by others.<br>
In order to evaluate the drug-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, the levels of SAKP, SGPT, SGOT and BUN were biochemically measured in normal and S-180 bearing mice sequentially after 48 hr (day 9) for noting immediate effects, after 192 hr (day 15) for intermediate effects and after 336 hr ( day 21) for late effects, if any, following drug therapy. For normal control mice the respective values recorded are 16.0 IU/I, 6.5 IU/I, 6.6.KA unit and 12.0 mg/dl respectively which are within the range of reported values (Figure 3). It is worth noting that all the above levels remained near the normal range in the treated groups of mice.<br>
Discussion - Toxicological screening<br>
Literature survey reveals that tumorigenesis and its progression has been accompanied with the following changes compared with normalcy : (1) gradual decrease in hemoglobin content, erythrocyte count and bone marrow cellularity (2) gradual increase in leucocytes and thrombocytes and splenic cellularity and (3) reversal of lymphoid-myeloid ratio in the differential WBC count.<br>
As noted in Figure 1, it was observed that there was negligible decreases (10-15%) in the hemoglobin level and erythrocyte count in the treated groups and these levels were elevated within 14 days of drug therapy with 1d(n = 2, R = 6- Bromo). The initial decrease (13.0%) in femoral marrow cellularity observed in the ST group on day 9 (Figure 2) appears to be due to the combined effects of tumorigenesis and the compound 1d. However, the normal value was quickly reached as tumour bearing animals gradually became normal following treatment. It was also evident that neither leucocytosis and thrombocytosis nor leucopenia and thrombocytopenia occured in these groups. However, initial hyposplenic activity was observed in ST group which reached normal value on day 21 (Figure 2). Thus the results indicate that compound 1d (n = 2, R = 6 - Bromo) does not adversely affect hematopoiesis at its optimum dose.<br>
It is well known that there are significant elevations in the levels of SAKP and SGPT in liver diseases and disorders and in hepatocellular damages caused by a number of agents. An increase in the SGOT level is observed in patients with cardiac<br><br>
damage due to myocardial infarction and with liver disorders. Biochemical measurements of these parameters showed that those values remained within the normal range in treated groups (Figure 3). An increase in the BUN level is noted in cases of renal diseases and damage. Since the BUN values in all the treated groups remained within the normal range (Figure 3), the said compound 1d has not displayed nephrotoxicity (BUN level &gt; 30.0 mg/dl is considered significant for toxicity).<br>
Essentially similar toxicological screening assay results were obtained for other 1d compounds (n = 2;R = H,6- Chloro, 5 - NO2) at their optimum doses.<br><br><br><br><br>
