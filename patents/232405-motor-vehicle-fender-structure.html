				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a fender structure of a motor vehicle and, more particularly, to a motor vehicle fender   structure in which a fender is mounted on an apron member.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 7-291147 discloses a motor vehicle fender structure in which a fender is mounted on an apron member as shown in Fig. 22 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure shown in Fig. 22, a fender apron 106 having an upper portion 104 with a closed sectional shape is formed by fixing an apron member 102 to an<br>
upper inward side surface of a. front apron side panel 100. The upper surface of apron member 102, is formed as a first fender mounting surface 110 to which a mounting flange 108B extending from an upstanding portion (vertical wall portion) 108A of a fender panel 108 is connected and fixed. A second fender mounting surface 112 is formed by an upper end portion of the apron member 102 from the first fender mounting surface 110 and bending an upper edge portion of the apron member 102 towards the outside of the vehicle body, so that the second fender mounting surface 112 is positioned above and outwardly of the first fender mounting surface 110. Therefore, thi,s motor vehicle fender structure can be used commonly for different car models that differ relatively greatly in entire body width, or in the height of a hood panel 114, as indicated by solid lines and two-dot lines in Fig. 22.<br>
However, this motor vehicle fender structure supports a load applied to the fender panel 108 from above (as indicated by arrow F in Fig. 22) in the following manner. In a case where the fender panel 108 and the hood panel 114 are mounted as indicated by the solid lines in Fig. 22, a load onto the fender panel 108 is supported by the bending rigidity of the<br><br>
mounting flange 108B of the fender panel 108 and the bending rigidity of the second fender mounting surface 112. Therefore, this structure provides a considerably increased rigidity for supporting the fender panel 108, thereby considerably reducing the energy absorbing effect with respect to a load applied to the fender panel 108 from above.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a motor vehicle fender structure that improves the energy absorbing effect with respect to a load applied to a fender panel from above.<br>
To achieve said objective, this invention provides a motor vehicle fender structure is characterized in that a fender is mounted on an apron member, and a substantially vertical wall portion of the fender positioned substantially above the apron member is placed apart from an upper surface of the apron member by a pre-determined distance.<br>
Since said vertical wall portion of the fender positioned above the apron member is placed apart from said upper surface of the apron member, a load applied to a fender panel from above will easily deform the substantially vertical wall portion of the fender downward. Furthermore, it becomes unlikely that said vertical wall portion of the fender will interfere with said apron member. Therefore, the deforming stroke of the fender is increased. In this manner, the energy absorbing effect of the fender structure is improved.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention, said vertical wall portion may be placed apart from the upper surface of the apron member in a transversely outward direction relative to the vehicle.<br>
With the construction in which the substantially vertical wall portion positioned above the apron member is placed apart from<br><br>
the upper surface of the apron member in a transversely outward direction relative to a vehicle, a load applied to the fender panel from above will easily deform the substantially vertical wall portion of the fender downward. Furthermore, it becomes unlikely that the substantially vertical wall portion of the fender will interfere with the apron member at the time of downward deformation of the vertical wall portion of the fender. Therefore, the deforming stroke is increased. In this manner, the energy absorbing effect of the fender structure is improved.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention, the substantially vertical wall portion may be placed apart from the upper surface of the apron member in an upward direction relative to the vehicle.<br>
With the construction in which the substantially vertical wall portion positioned above the apron member is placed apart from the upper surface of the apron member in an upward direction relative to the vehicle, a load applied to the fender panel rom above will easily deform the substantially vertical wall portion of the fender downward. Furthermore, it becomes unlikely that the substantially vertical wall portion of the fender will interfere with the apron member at the time of downward deformation of the vertical wall portion of the fender. Therefore, the deforming stroke is increased. In this manner, the energy absorbing effect of the fender structure is improved.<br>
The motor vehicle fender structure may further have a construction wherein the substantially vertical wall portion is fixed to the apron member, at substantially longitudinal end portions of the vertical wall portion in a fore-aft direction relative to the vehicle, and a longitudinally intermediate portion of the vertical wall portion is placed apart from the upper surface of the apron member.<br><br>
With this construction, the fender can be reliably supported since the longitudinally opposite end portions of the vertical wall portion of the fender are fixed to the apron member.<br>
Furthermore, the motor vehicle fender structure may also have a construction wherein the apron member has a lowered surface portion positioned lower than an upper most portion of the apron member, and said vertical wall portion of the fender is positioned above said lowered surface portion at a predetermined distance. Furthermore, the said lowered surface portion is formed by a bevel portion at a corner site of the upper surface of the apron member. Such a construction will further increase the deforming stroke of the fender.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention, the<br>
substantially vertical wall portion of the fender may be<br>
connected to the upper surface of the apron member by a resin-<br>
made mounting member. The provision of the mounting member<br>
firmly connecting the vertical wall portion of the fender to<br>
the apron member will make the support of the fender reliable.<br>
Furthermore, if the vertical wall portion of the fender<br>
deforms downward, the resin-made mounting member breaks<br>
readily while effectively absorbing energy during the breaking<br>
process.	 <br>
The present invention therefore, provides a motor vehicle fender structure characterized in that a fender is mounted on an apron member, and a  substantially vertical wall portion of the fender positioned substantially above the apron member is placed apart from an upper surface of the apron member by a pre-determined distance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
The first embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
In the' drawings, arrow FR indicates a forward direction relative to a vehicle body, and arrow IN indicates a transversely inward direction relative to the vehicle body, and arrow UP indicates an upward direction relative to the vehicle body.<br>
In the first embodiment, boundaries 16 between a hood panel 12 and fender panels 14 of a vehicle body 10 extend in transversely opposite end portions of a hood 18 in a fore-aft direction relative to the vehicle body 10 as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. l,a hood insulator 20 is disposed on a lower surface 12A of each of two transversely opposite end portions of the hood panel 12 and extends in the fore-aft direction relative to the vehicle body 10. A sectional shape of the hood insulator 20 viewed in the fore-aft direction is the shape of an inverted hat with its opening facing upward. An inward flange 20A protruding from the hat-opening portion of the hood insulator 20 in a transversely inward direction relative to the vehicle body 10 is welded to the lower surface 12A of the hood panel 12. An outward flange 20B protruding from the hat-opening portion of the hood insulator 20 in a transversely outward direction is fixed to a transversely outward edge portion 12B of the hood panel 12 by a hemming process.<br>
An apron member 24 extends in the fore-aft direction, below each of the boundaries 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panels 14. The apron member 24 is substantially made up of an upper apron member 26 that forms an upper portion of the apron member 24, and a lower apron member 28 that forms a lower portion of the apron member 24.<br><br>
The upper apron member 26 has a generally a "U" sectional shape with its opening facing downward. A flange 26B of the upper apron member 26 extends transversely outward from a lower end of a transversely outward wall portion 26A of the upper apron member 26. The lower apron member 28 has a generally "L" sectional shape. A flange 28B of the lower apron member 28 extends transversely outward from an upper end of a transversely outward wall portion 28A of the lower apron member 28. The flange 26B of the upper apron member 26 and the flange 28B of the lower apron member 28 are welded to each other.<br>
A flange 28D of the lower apron member 28 extends downward relative to the vehicle from a lower wall portion 28C of the lower apron member 28. The flange 28D is welded to a lower edge portion 26D of a transversely inward wall portion 26C of the upper apron member 2 6.<br>
v- .<br>
Therefore, the upper apron member 26 and the lower apron member 28 of the apron member 24 form a closed portion 30 having a closed sectional shape and extending in the fore-aft direction.<br>
A transversely inward-side portion 32A of a lower wall portion of a fender inner panel 32 is fixed to an upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26, by welding or using fixture devices such as bolts or the like (not shown) . A transversely outward-side portion 32B of the lower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32 protrudes transversely outward of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26. A vertical wall 32C extending upward from the transversely outward-side portion 32B of the lower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32, that is, a fender vertical wan portion, is disposed apart from the transversely outward wall portion 26A of the upper apron member 26, by a predetermined distance L in a transversely outward direction relative to the vehicle.<br><br>
The flange 26B of the upper apron member 26 is disposed downwardly apart from the transversely outward-side portion 32B of the fender inner panel 32, by a predetermined distance M.<br>
A flange 32D of the fender inner panel 32 extends from an upper end of the vertical wall portion 32C of the fender inner panel 32 toward the transversely outward edge portion 12B of the hood panel 12. The flange 32D of the fender inner panel 32 is fixed to a transversely inward edge portion 14A of the fender panel 14 by a hemming process.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state as shown in Fig. 1, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the transversely inward-side portion 32A of the lower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32 is fixed to an upper surface of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 2 6.<br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood<br>
panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction (as indicated by arrow A in Fig. 1) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 1.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure according to this embodiment, the vertical wall portion 32C extending upward from the transversely outward-side portion 32B of the lower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32 is placed apart from the transversely outward wall portion 26A of the upper apron member 26 by the predetermined distance L in the transversely outward direction relative to the vehicle, so that a load from above is borne only by the transversely outward-side portion 32B of the lower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32.<br><br>
Therefore, the transversely outward-side portion 32B of the Tower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32 is deformed downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 1, by a relatively small load. The deformation of the transversely outward-side portion 32B in this manner effectively absorbs energy.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the flange 26B of the upper apron member 26 is placed apart from the transversely outward-side portion 32B of the lower wall portion of the fender inner panel 32 by the predetermined distance M in a downward direction relative to the vehicle. Therefore, if the transversely outward-side portion 32B deforms downward, it is unlikely to interfere with the flange 26B of the upper apron member 26. A long deforming stroke of the fender panel 14 is thereby secured, so that the energy absorbing effect is further improved.<br>
The second embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention will he described with reference to Fig. 3.<br>
Portions of the second embodiment comparable to those of the first embodiment are represented by comparable reference characters in Fig. 3, and will not be described again.<br>
In the second embodiment, a fender panel 14 has a vertical wall portion 14B that extends downward from a boundary-adjacent portion of the fender panel 14 so as to form a transversely inward wall portion, as shown in Fig. 3. A flange 14C of the fender panel 14 extends transversely inward from a lower end of the vertical wall portion 14B. A transversely inward-side portion 14D of the flange 14C is fixed to an upper surface of an upper wall portion 26E of an upper apron member 26 by, for example, welding or using fixture devices such as bolts or the like (not shown) . A transversely outward-side<br><br>
portion 14E of the flange 14C protrudes transversely outward of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26.<br>
A downwardly-recessed stepped portion is formed at a transversely outward-side corner portion of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26. The stepped portion 36 is formed by a vertical wall portion 36A and a lower wall portion 36B. The vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is placed apart from the vertical wall portion 36A of the stepped portion 36 by a predetermined distance L in a transversely outward direction relative to the vehicle. The lower wall portion 36B of the stepped portion 36 is placed apart downward from the transversely outward-side portion 14E of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 by a predetermined distance M.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state as shown in Fig. 3, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the transversely inward-side portion 14D of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 is fixed to the upper surface of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 2 6.<br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction (as indicated by arrow A in Fig. 3) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 3.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure according to the second embodiment, the downward-recessed stepped portion 36 is formed at the transversely outward-side corner portion of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26, and the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is positioned<br><br>
apart from the vertical wall portion 36A of the stepped<br>
portion 36 by the predetermined distance L in the transversely outward direction relative to the vehicle. Therefore, a load on the fender panel 14 from above is borne only by the transversely outward-side portion 14E of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14. Consequently, the fender panel 14 is deformed downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 3, by a relatively small load. The deformation of the fender panel 14 in this manner effectively absorbs energy.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the lower wall portion 36B of the stepped portion 36 of the upper apron member 26 is placed apart downward from the transversely outward-side portion 14E of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 by the predetermined distance M. Therefore, if the transversely outward-side portion 14E of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 deforms downward, the transversely outward-side portion 14E is unlikely to interfere with the lower wall portion 36B of the stepped portion 36 of the upper apron member 26. A long deforming stroke of ,the fender panel 14 is thereby secured, so that the energy absorbing effect is further improved.<br>
The third embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention will be described with reference to Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
Portions of the third embodiment comparable to those of the first embodiment are represented by comparable reference characters in Figs. 4 and 5, and will not be described again.<br>
In this embodiment, an apron member 40 is substantially made up of an inner apron member 42 that forms a transversely inward portion of the apron member 40, and an outer apron member 44 that forms a transversely outward portion of the apron member 40, as shown in Fig. 4.<br><br>
The outer apron member 44 has a generally "L" sectional shape, the outer apron member 44 has a flange 44B that extends transversely outward from an upper end of a transversely outward wall of the outer apron member 44. The inner apron member 42 has a generally "L" sectional shape. A transversely outward-side portion 42B of an upper wall portion 42A of the inner apron member 42 is welded to the flange 44B of the outer apron member 44. A flange 44D extends downward from a transversely inward-side end of a lower wall portion 44C of the outer apron member 44. The flange 44D of the outer apron member 44 is welded to a lower edge portion 42D of a transversely inward wall portion 42C of the inner apron member 42. Therefore, the inner apron member 42 and the outer apron member 44 of the apron member 40 form a closed portion 30 having a closed sectional shape and extending in a fore-aft direction relative to the vehicle body.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5. forward and rearward end portions (longitudinally opposite end portions) 14F of a flange 14C of a fender panel 14 are fixed to an upper surface of the upper wall portion 42A of the inner apron member 42 by fixture devices 46 such as bolts or the like. A longitudinally intermediate portion 14G of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart upward from the upper wall portion 42A of the inner apron. member 42 by a predetermined distance M as indicated in Fig. 4. The longitudinally intermediate portion 14G  is an intermediate portion of the flange 14C in the fore-aft direction of the vehicle.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the forward and rearward end portions 14F of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 are fixed to the upper surface of the upper wall portion 42A of the inner apron member 42 as shown in Fig. 5.<br><br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction (as indicated by arrow A in Fig. 4) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 4.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure according to the this embodiment, the longitudinally intermediate portion 14G of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart upward from the upper wall portion 42A of the inner apron member 42 by the predetermined distance M. Therefore, a load on the fender panel 14 from above is borne only by the longitudinally intermediate portion 14G of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14. Consequently, the fender panel 14 is deformed downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 4, by a relatively small load. The deformation of the fender panel 14 in this manner effectively absorbs energy. Furthermore, if the longitudinally intermediate portion, 146 of the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 deforms downward, the longitudinally intermediate portion 146 is unlikely to interfere with the upper wall portion 42A of the inner apron member 42. A long deforming stroke of the fender panel 14 is thereby secured, so that the energy absorbing effect is further improved.<br>
The fourth embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention will be described with reference to Figs. 6 through 8.<br>
Portions of the fourth	embodiment comparable to those of the<br>
first embodiment are	represented by  comparable  reference<br>
characters in Figs. 6through 8, and will not be described again.<br><br>
In this embodiment, a bevel portion 48 is formed at a Transversely outward-side corner portion of an upper wall portion 26E of an upper apron member 26. A lower end of the bevel portion 48 is positioned apart downward from a vertical wall portion 14B of a fender panel 14 by a predetermined distance M, as indicated in Fig. 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, mounting brackets 50 are disposed on forward and rearward end portions (longitudinally opposite end portions) of the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, each mounting bracket 50 has a generally "L" sectional shape. An upper edge portion of a vertical wall 50A of each mounting bracket 50 is welded to a lower edge portion of the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14. A transversely inward-side portion 50C of a lower wall portion 50B of each mounting bracket 50 is fixed to an upper surface of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26 by a fixture device 52 such as a bolt and a nut or the like. A transversely outward-side portion 50D of the lower wall portion 50B of each mounting bracket 50 protrudes transversely outward of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26.<br>
Therefore, a clearance 54 is formed between the bevel portion 48 of the upper apron member 26 and the transversely outward-side portion 50D of the lower wall portion SOB of each mounting bracket 50.<br>
The operation of the embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state as shown in Fig. 7, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is firmly connected to the upper surface of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26 by the<br><br>
mounting brackets 50 attached to the forward and rearward end portions of the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14.<br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction (as indicated by arrow A in Fig. 6) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 6.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure according to the this embodiment, the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart upward from the bevel portion 48 of the upper apron member 26 by the predetermined distance M. Therefore, the fender panel 14 is deformed downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 6, by a relatively small load. The deformation of the fender panel 14 in this manner effectively absorbs energy. Furthermore, if the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 deforms downward, the vertical wall portion 14B is unlikely to interfere with the inner apron member 26E. A long deforming stroke of the fender panel 14 is thereby secured, so that the energy absorbing effect is further improved.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the clearance 54 is formed at the sites of fixture between the upper apron member 26 and the forward and rearward end portions of the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14. More specifically, the clearance<br>
54 is formed between the bevel portion 48 of the upper apron member 26 and the transversely outward-side portion 5OD of the lower wall portion 50B of each mounting bracket 50. Therefore, if the transversely outward-side portion 50D of the lower wall portion 50B of a mounting bracket 50 deforms downward as indicated by two-dot lines in Fig. 7, the transversely outward-side portion 5OD is unlikely to interfere with the<br><br>
bevel portion 48 of the upper apron member 26. Thus, the motor vehicle fender structure of this embodiment is able to absorb energy at the sites of fixture of the fender panel 14 to the upper apron member 26 as well.<br>
The fifth embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention will be described with reference to Figs. 9 through 12.<br>
Portions of the fifth	embodiment comparable to those of the<br>
first  embodiment  are	represented by  comparable  reference<br>
characters in Figs. 9through 12, and will not be described again.<br>
In this embodiment, a mounting flange 56 formed from a resin, such as ABS or the like, is fixed to a vertical wall portion<br>
*<br>
14B of a fender panel 14 by rivets 58, as shown in Fig. 9. A vertical wall portion 56A of the mounting flange 56 is fixed to the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14. A lower wall portion 5,6B of the mounting flange 56 is fixed to a mounting seat 60 raised from an upper wall portion 26E of an upper apron member 26, by fixture devices 62 such as bolts and nuts or the like.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, a stepped portion 64 is formed in a connecting portion between the vertical wall portion 56A and the lower wall portion 56B of the mounting flange 56. The stepped portion 64 is formed by a horizontal wall portion 64A extending from a lower end of the vertical wall portion 56A substantially horizontally in a transversely inward direction relative to the vehicle, and a vertical wall portion 64B extending substantially vertically upward from a transversely outward-side end of the lower wall portion 56B.<br>
A thick wall portion 66 is formed adjacent to the fixture sites where the mounting flange 56 is fixed by the rivets 58<br><br>
and the fixture devices 62. The thick wall portion 66 is formed by filling a space under the stepped portion 64 with resin. A flange 26B of the upper apron member 26 is positioned apart downward from the thick wall portion 66 by a predetermined distance M.<br>
The operation of the embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is firmly connected to the upper surface of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26 by the mounting flange 56 fixed to the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 as shown in Fig. 9, and since the resin-filled thick wall portion 66 is formed under the stepped portion 64 of the mounting flange 56.<br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction Xas indicated by arrow A in Fig. 10) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure according to the this embodiment, the mounting flange 56 is formed from a resin material, and provided with the stepped portion 64 connecting between the vertical wall portion 56A and the lower wall portion 56B. Therefore, the horizontal wall portion 64A of the stepped portion 64, where a load concentrates, breaks relatively easily. Energy is absorbed during the process of breakage of the horizontal wall portion 64A.<br>
Furthermore, since the thick wall portion 66 of the mounting flange 56 is apart upward from the flange 26B of the upper apron member 26 by the predetermined distance M, the thick<br><br>
wall portion 66 of the mounting flange 56 is unlikely to interfere with the flange 26B of the upper apron member 26. Therefore, a long deforming stroke of the fender panel 14 is secured, so that the energy absorbing effect is further improved.<br>
The relationship between the load F and the deforming stroke S in the motor vehicle fender structure of this embodiment is indicated in the graph in Fig. 12. As indicated by a solid-line curve, the load F sharply decreases as the deforming stroke S increases from a stroke SI at which the horizontal wall portion 64A of the stepped portion 64 starts breaking. After the breakage is completed at a stroke 82, the load F becomes substantially constant, equaling a deforming load FO supported by the other portions of the fender panel 14. In comparison with a conventional art as indicated by a broken-line curve where the deforming load is not sufficiently reduced after the deforming stroke exceeds 81, the motor vehicle fender structure of this embodiment considerably reduces the deforming load.<br>
The sixth embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention will be described with reference to Figs. 13 through 16.<br>
Portions of the sixth embodiment comparable to those of the first embodiment are represented by comparable reference characters in Figs. 13 through 16, and will not be described again.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, a flange 14H extends transversely inward from a lower end of a vertical wall portion 14B of a fender panel 14 in this embodiment. The mounting flange 14H is fixed to a raised mounting seat 68 that is formed in a transversely outward-side portion of an upper wall portion 26E of an upper<br><br>
apron member 26, by fixture devices 70 such as bolts and nuts or the like.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the length (vertical dimension) H of the vertical wall portion 14B and the width W of the flange 14H of the fender panel 14 are reduced at a site apart from the mounting portions of the fender panel 14. A downwardly depressed stepped portion 72 is formed in a transversely outward-side portion of the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26. The flange 14H of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart from a vertical wall portion 72A of the stepped portion 72 by a predetermined distance L in a transversely outward direction relative to the vehicle. A lower wall portion 72B of the stepped portion 72 is positioned apart downward from the flange 14H of the fender panel 14 by a predetermined distance M.<br>
An upwardly depressed stepped portion 74 is formed in a<br>
transversely outward-side portion of a lower wall portion 20C of a hood insulator 20. A horizontal wall portion 74A of the stepped portion 74 ispositioned a predetermined distance N upward from the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26. The horizontal wall portion 74A of the stepped portion 74 contacts a weather strip 76 that is fixed to the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is fixed to the mounting seat 68 formed in the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26, at the flange 14H extending transversely inward from a lower end of the vertical wall portion 14B, as shown in Fig. 14.<br><br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction (as indicated by arrow A in Fig. 15) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward.<br>
Fig. 16 indicates the relationship between the load F and the deforming stroke S in the motor vehicle fender structure of this invention (indicated by a solid-line curve) and a conventional motor vehicle fender structure (indicated by a dashed-line curve) . Since the length H of the vertical wall portion 14B and the width W of the flange 14H are reduced at a site apart from the mounting portions of the fender panel 14 in this embodiment, the bending rigidity of the fender panel 14 is less in the embodiment than in the conventional fender structure. Therefore, the embodiment reduces the initial load at a stroke SI from the conventional load Fl to a load F2.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the flange 14H of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart from the vertical wall portion 72A of the stepped portion 72 of the upper apron member 26 by the predetermined distance L in the transversely outward direction. The lower wall portion 72B of the stepped portion 72 is positioned apart downward from the flange 14H of the fender panel 14 by the predetermined distance M. Therefore, if the fender panel 14 is deformed downward, the fender panel 14 is unlikely to interfere with the upper apron member 26. Consequently, the embodiment eliminates the load F3 caused at a stroke S2 by the interference between the upper apron member and the fender panel in the conventional structure indicated by the dashed-line curve in Fig. 16. Furthermore, since the horizontal wall portion 74A of the stepped portion 74 of the hood insulator 20 is positioned the predetermined distance N apart from the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26, it is unlikely that the hood insulator 20 and the<br><br>
upper apron member 26 will interfere with each other at the time of deformation. Consequently, the embodiment eliminates the load F4 that is caused at a stroke S3 by the interference between the upper apron member and the hood insulator in the conventional structure indicated by the dashed-line curve in Fig. 16.<br>
Therefore, the motor vehicle fender structure of the embodiment lowers the deforming load distribution from the conventional distribution (indicated by the dashed-line curve in Fig. 16) to the distribution (indicated by the solid-line curve in Fig. 16) .<br>
The seventh embodiment of the motor vehicle fender structure of the invention will be described with reference to Figs. 17 through 21.<br>
Portions of the seventh embodiment comparable to those of the first embodiment are represented by comparable reference characters in Figs., 17 through 21, and will not be described again.<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, a fender panel 14 has a forward mounting portion 14J that protrudes from a forward portion of the fender panel 14 in a transversely inward direction relative to the vehicle in this embodiment. The forward mounting portion 14J is fixed to an upper surface of a radiator support member 82, at a site near a transversely outward-side end portion 82A of the radiator support member 82, by a fastener device 80 such as a bolt and a nut or the like. In Fig. 20, a suspension tower 83 is shown.<br>
As shown in Fig. 21, the fender panel 14 has a rearward mounting portion 14K that protrudes transversely inward from a rearward portion of the fender panel 14. The rearward mounting portion 14K is fixed to a mounting portion 86A that is formed<br><br>
in a rearward portion of a hood panel hinge bracket 86, by a fastener device 84 such as a bolt and a nut or the like.<br>
As shown in Pig. 18, the mounting portion 86A of the hood panel hinge bracket 86 protrudes transversely inward from an upper end of a vertical wall portion 86B of the hood panel hinge bracket 86. A flange 86C extends transversely outward from a lower end of the vertical wall portion 86B of the hood panel hinge bracket 86. The flange 86C is fixed to an upper wall portion 26E of an upper apron member 26 by fastener devices 88 such as bolts and nuts or the like.<br>
In this embodiment, the various components are fastened or firmly connected as described above. A flange 14C extending transversely inward from a lower end of a vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart upward from the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26 by a predetermined distance N as indicated in Fig. 17, at a site near the suspension tower 83.<br>
t<br>
In the embodiment with the fastened structure as described above, the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart from a transversely inward wall portion 26C of the upper apron member 26 by a predetermined distance W in a transversely inward direction relative to the vehicle as indicated in Fig. 19, at a site forward of the suspension tower 83.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will be described below.<br>
In a normal state, the fender panel 14 is reliably supported since the forward mounting portion 14J of the fender panel 14 is fixed to the upper surface of the radiator support member 82, at the site near the transversely outward-side end portion 82A of the radiator support member 82, and since the rearward mounting portion 14K of the fender panel 14 is fixed to the<br><br>
mounting portion 86A formed in a rearward portion of the hood panel hinge bracket 86, as shown in Fig. 21.<br>
If a load is applied around the boundary 16 between the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 in a substantially vertically downward direction (as indicated by arrow A in Pig. 17) , a portion of the hood panel 12 adjacent to the boundary 16 and a portion of the fender panel 14 adjacent to the boundary 16 deform downward.<br>
In the motor vehicle fender structure of this embodiment, the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart from the upper wall portion 26E of the upper apron member 26 by the predetermined distance N as indicated in Fig. 17, near the suspension tower 83. At a site forward of the suspension tower 83, the vertical wall portion 14B of the fender panel 14 is positioned apart from the transversely inward wall portion 26C of the upper apron member 26 by the predetermined distance W in the transversely inward direction relative to the vehicle, as indicated in Fig. 19. Therefore, the fender panel 14 is deformed downward by a relatively small load. The vertical wall portion 14B and the flange 14C of the fender panel 14 are unlikely to interfere with the upper apron member 26 at the time of deformation. Therefore, a long deforming stroke of the Render panel14 is secured, so that the energy absorbing effect is improved.<br>
Therefore, the motor vehicle fender structure of this embodiment is able to lower the deforming load distribution in comparison with the conventional fender structure, as in the sixth embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the forward mounting portion 14J of the fender panel 14 is fixed to the upper surface of the radiator support member 82, at the site near the transversely outward-side end portion 82A of the radiator<br><br>
support member 82, and the rearward mounting portion 14K of the fender panel 14 is fixed to the mounting portion 86A formed in the rearward portion of the hood panel hinge bracket 86. Therefore, the apron member 24 can be disposed at a desired position in accordance with the design of the fender panel 14, the parting line of the hood panel 12, or the like, so that the apron member 24 can easily be used commonly for many derivatives of a vehicle model. Further, according to the embodiment, the position of the apron member 24 in a vehicle in which the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 are disposed at relatively low positions can be maintained in a vehicle in which the hood panel 12 and the fender panel 14 are disposed at relatively high positions.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be preferred embodiments thereof, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments or constructions but may also be modified or changed in various other manners within the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
