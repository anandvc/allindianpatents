The present invention relates to a process for preparing elastomeric copolymers of ethylene-propylene (EPM) type and elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) type.<br>
For the above said copolymerizations, zirconium or titanium complexes are being developed more and more which bear ligands of bis-indenyl type, bis-fluorenyl  type  or  of  mixed  type,  as,  e.g., fluorenyl-cyclopentadienyl  ligands  (P.C.  Mohring, N.J. Coville, J. Organomet. Chem. 479, 1, 1994).<br>
Unfortunately, these catalysts display the drawback that not always they give rise to acceptable viscosity values from application viewpoint, in particular when elastomeric copolymers of ethylene-propylene type are prepared with propylene contents comprised within the range of from 35 to 65 % by weight, which is that composition range which yields the best results as . to elastomeric properties.<br>
It is known as well that in the preparation of EPM or EPDM copolymers, the copolymerization is often performed in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight regulant.<br>
However, the use of hydrogen implies sometimes considerable difficulties owing to the high sensibility of the metallocene-based catalytic system to hydrogen. It derives that the hydrogen amounts suitable for regulating the molecular weight<br><br>
are too low to be properly metered.<br>
The Italian Patent Application IT-A-MI 95/A 001444 discloses a new family of metallocenes, in particular o-xylene-a,a'-bisindenyl metallocenes. These metallocenes are prepared by starting from a,a'-dibromo-o-xylene and indene, or its derivatives, in the presence of lithium-butyl. The so obtained o-xylene-a,a'-bis-indenyl is then reacted with ZrCl4, thus giving rise to the above said metallocenes.<br>
The present Applicant found now that some of these metallocenes are particularly useful in the production of ethylene-propylene elastomers with high Mooney viscosity values and make it possible the above drawbacks to be overcome.<br>
In accordance therewith, the present invention relates to a process for preparing elastomeric copolymers of ethylene-propylene (EPM) type and elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) type with propylene contents comprised within the range of from 15 to 75 % by weight, preferably of from 25 to 70 % by weight, still more preferably of from 35 to 60 % by weight, which comprises the following steps:<br>
1) propylene and optional diene are fed to a polymerization reactor, preferably diluted with a hydrocarbon, still more preferably with a low boiling C3-C5 hydrocarbon, preferably propane, under such a pressure as to allow propylene to be used in liquified form;<br><br>
ethylene is added to the mixture obtained from above step (1) in a sufficient amount for keeping the desired ethylene:propylene ratio in the liquid phase;<br>
to the mixture obtained from above step (2), the catalytic system is added which comprises one or more metallocenes having the general formula (I) and one or more co-catalysts selected from (i) compounds    with    general    formula    (IV) (Ra) xNH4-xB (Rd) 4,   with   general   formula   (V) (Ra) 3PHB (Rd) 4/ with general formula (VI) B (Rd) 3/ with   general   formula   (VII)   (CeHs) aCB (Rd) 4/ optionally  in the presence  of  an  alkylating agent, (ii) alumoxane;<br>
the mixture obtained from above step (3) is caused to react during a long enough time in order to allow the polymerization to take place of the system constituted by ethylene, propylene and optional diene system in order to yield an EP(D)M having a Mooney viscosity (ML1+4 at 100°C) higher than 20,<br>
aracterized in that the catalytic system comprises least one metallocene selected from those having<br>
e general formula (I)<br><br><br><br>
(I)<br>
wherein<br>
M is selected from titanium, zirconium, hafnium;<br>
X is selected from halogen, alkoxy, amido, carboxy,<br>
carbamate, alkyl, aryl, hydrogen; preferably, X is<br>
selected from halogen,  C1-C3 hydrocarbyl radical,<br>
hydrogen, still more preferably X is chlorine;<br>
A is a radical of r|^-indenyl type  (la)  or TJ^-<br>
tetrahydroindenyl type (lb)<br><br><br><br><br>
(la)	(lb)<br>
wherein the radicals Ri and R2, which may be the same or different from each other, are selected from H, aliphatic radical, cycloaliphatic radical, aryl radical, preferably from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, phenyl;<br>
with those compounds in which A is represented by formula (la), R2 = H and R1 is different from-H in 3-, 4- and 7-positions, being excluded.<br><br>
According to the preferred embodiment, all R2 are the same and are -H and in A radical the number of Ri different from -H is equal to, or lower than, 3.<br>
Examples of compounds having general formula (I) with different A radicals and different Ri radicals, which are effective in the process according to the present invention, are:<br>
-	o-xylene-a,a'-bis- [r\^- (3-methyl) -inden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
-	o-xylene-a,a'-bis- [T]"- (5, 6-dimethyl) -inden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
—	o-xylene-a,a'-bis- [r|^- (4, 7-dimethyl) -inden-l-yll<br>
zirconium dichloride;<br>
-	o-xylene-a,a'-bis- [rf- (3-methyl) -4, 5, 6, 7-<br>
tetrahydroinden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
—	o-xylene-a,a' -bis- [r\^- (3,5, 6-trimethyl) -4, 5, 6, 7-tetrahydroinden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
—	o-xylene-a,a'-bis-[ri^-inden-1-yl]        zirconium dichloride;<br>

-	o-xylene-a,a'-bis- [yf-(3-ethyl)-inden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
-	o-xylene-a,a'-bis- [r\^- (3-phenyl) -inden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
—	o-xylene-a,a' -bis- [TI^-4, 5, 6, 7-tetrahydroinden-l-<br>
yl] zirconium dichloride;<br>
A typical example of metallocenes which cannot be used in the preparation of EP(D)M according to<br><br>
the  present  invention  is  o-xylene-a,a'-bis-[rj^-3,4,7-trimethyl-inden-l-yl ] zirconium dichloride.<br>
In  the  copolymerization  of  ethylene  with propylene (and optional diene) the catalytic system additional comprises, besides metallocene of general formula (I), also a further component (which will be referred to herein as "co-catalyst") selected from alumoxane and compounds having the general formula (IV) (Ra) xNH4-xB (Rd) 4 (wherein x is selected from 1, 2 or 3) or (V) (Ra) 3PHB (Rd) 4, or (VI) B(Rd)3, or (VII) (CeHs) 3CB (Rd) 4r which, by reacting with a metallocene having the  general  formula  (I)  are  capable  of generating catalytic systems with ionic character. In the above said compounds having general formula (IV), (V),  (VI) or (VII), the Ra groups, which may be the same or different from one another,  are monofunctional alkyl or aryl radicals,  and Rd's, which may be the same or different from one another, are  monofunctional   aryl   radicals,   preferably partially  or  totally  fluorinated,  still  more preferably totally fluorinated.<br>
The nature of the co-catalyst is known to determine the modalities of preparation of the catalytic system. In the following the general description is supplied of two methods of preparation of the catalytic system, both of which are well known for those skilled in the art.<br>
According to a first method, the catalytic system is prepared by starting from one or more metallocenes  of  general  formula  (I)  and  an<br><br>
alumoxane. Under the general term "alumoxane", an aluminium compound is meant, which can have an either linear or cyclic structure. The linear structure as the general formula (VIII)<br>
(Re)2-Al-0-[-Al-0(Re)-0-]p-Al(Re)2,  and  the  cyclic alumoxanes have the general formula (IX) - [-0-A1 (Re)-0-]p+2-, in which the several Re's, which may be the same or different from each other, are selected from H,  Ci-Ce-alkyI radicals,  Ce-Cis-aryl radicals; "p" is an integer having a value comprised within the range of from 2 to 50, preferably of from 10 to 35. When the several Re's are all the same, they  are  selected  from  methyl,  ethyl,  propyl, isobutyl, and preferably are methyl.<br>
When the several Re's are different from one another, they preferably are methyl and hydrogen or, alternatively, methyl and isobutyl, with hydrogen and isobutyl being preferred.<br>
The alumoxane can be prepared according to various methods well known to those skilled in the art. One from these methods comprises, for example, reacting an aluminium alkyl compound and/or an aluminium alkyl hydride with water (either in gas, or solid, liquid or bound form, for example as crystal water) in an inert solvent, for example, toluene. For preparing an alumoxane having different Re alkyl radicals, two different trialkyl aluminum compounds (AlRs+AlR's) are reacted with water (see S. Pasynkiewicz, Polyhedron 9 (1990) 429-430 and EP-A-302,424) .<br><br>
The precise nature of alumoxane is not known, however from the market toluenic solutions of methyl-alumoxane are available, as, e.g., the product Eurecene 5100 lOT ex firm Witco) , of which the active aluminium concentration is indicated, which makes it very easy to use.<br>
The catalytic system is prepared by adding to the mixture of the thoroughly desiccated monomers, previously charged to the polymerization reactor, a hydrocarbon solution of 10 % alumoxane by weight. The resulting mixture is heated up to the desired temperature and then one or more metallocenes are added, which are selected from those with general formula (I), in such an amount as to obtain a total concentration comprised within the range of from 10"® up to 10"* M according to its activity, and with a molar ratio of aluminium to metallocene comprised within the range of from 5x10^ to 2x10*. In this way, the catalytic system is defined as being "prepared in situ".<br>
According to an alternative procedure, metallocene, or metallocene mixture, can be preactivated with alumoxane before being used in the polymerization step, with its activity being increased by this procedure. In this case, metallocene is dissolved in an inert hydrocarbon solvent, which is preferably either aliphatic or aromatic, still more preferably toluene, so that its concentration is comprised within the range of from 10"^ up to 10"* M.  The solution of alumoxane in<br><br>
/ loluene is then added in such a way that the molar ratio of alumoxane to metallocene is comprised /ithin the range of from 5x10^ up to 2x10"^. The ;omponents are caused to react during a time ;omprised within the range of from a few minutes up :o 60 hours, preferably of from 5 to 60 minutes, at I temperature comprised within the range of from ■78"C up to +100°C, preferably of from O'C up to '0°C. This route of preparation of the catalytic system is commonly referred to as "preliminary formation". When the preliminary formation time is mded, the reaction mixture is added to the mixture 3f monomers previously prepared in the )olymerization reactor, in such an amount that the jnd concentration of metallocene in the reaction lixture is comprised within the range of from 10~® to .0"^   moles/litre.<br>
According to a second method, the catalytic system is prepared still by starting from one or acre metallocenes with general formula (I) and a co-;atalyst with general formula (IV), (V), (VI) or (VII). In this case, the operating modalities depend 3n the nature of X radicals bound to M in the jeneral formula (I).<br>
With X being equal to H or to an alkyl radical, ;he catalytic system is prepared by adding one or nore metallocenes with general formula (I) to the previously prepared monomer mixture, in such an amount the total concentration is comprised within the range of from 10'^ up to 10"* moles/litre.  The<br><br>
mixture is then heated up to the desired temperature and then, as the co-catalyst, a compound is added which is selected from the compounds having general formula (IV), (V), (VI) or (VII), as disclosed in EP-A-277,004; at such a concentration that the total molar ratio to metallocene is comprised within the range of from 0.7 to 3.5.<br>
When X is different from H or a hydrocarbyl radical, the catalytic system will be formed by one or more metallocenes having general formula (I), an alkylating compound selected from trialkylaluminium, dialkymagnesium and alkyllithium, or still other alkylating agents well known to those skilled in the art, and any of compounds of general formula (IV) , (V), (VI) or (VII), or a mixture thereof, as disclosed in EP-A-612,769. In order to generate the catalytic system, the metallocene compound having general formula (I) is premixed with the suitable alkylating agent in either aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, or mixtures thereof, at a temperature comprised within the range of from -20 to +100°C, preferably of from 0°C to 60°C, and still more preferably of from +20°C to +50°C, during a time comprised within the range of from 1 minute to 24 hours, preferably of from 2 minutes to 12 hours, still more preferably from 5 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
The molar ratio of the alkylating compound and the compound with general formula (I) may be comprised within the range of from 1 to 1000, preferably of from 10 to 500, still more preferably<br><br>
f from 30 to 300.<br>
The mixture is then brought into contact with a cmpound with general formula (IV), (V), (VI) or VII) at the temperature indicated above, during a ime comprised within the range of from 1 minute to hours, preferably of from 2 minutes to 30 minutes, .nd the resulting mixture is then fed to the )olymerization reactor. The molar ratio of compound rith general formula (IV), (V), (VI) or (VII) to letallocene (I) can be comprised within the range of :rom 0.1 to 10, preferably of from 1 to 3.<br>
Independently of the method used in order to )repare the catalytic system, the reaction between ;he metallocene with general formula (I) and the co-;atalyst can be carried in the presence, or less, of '■ariable amounts of one, or all, of the monomer (s) ;o be polymerized. In the event small amounts of lonomer to be polymerized are present, i.e., with lolar ratios of monomer:metallocene comprised within :he range of from 10 to 1000, that process takes 5lace which, according to the prior art, is referred :o as "prepolymerization", during which small imounts are formed of a solid polymer which embed learly all the components of the catalytic system, [■his suspension of polymer/catalytic system displays 1 still higher catalytic activity, and can be used Ln order to polymerize large amounts of monomers, ^?ith the morphologic characteristics of the resulting polymer being improved.<br>
The catalytic systems according to the present<br><br>
invention are generally used at very low molar<br>
concentrations, comprised within the range of from<br>
10"*^ up to 10"% as expressed as metallocene of<br>
general formula (I) . Although they are so diluted,<br>
these catalytic systems are characterized by a very<br>
high activity, comprised within the range of from<br>
500 to 10,000 kg of polymer per g of transition<br>
metal per copolymerization hour. However, in order<br>
to obtain this activity levels at the above reported<br>
concentrations, the catalytic system must be<br>
carefully protected from possibly present catalyst<br>
poisons, also at ppm (parts per million parts)<br>
levels, in the monomers, above all in propylene, and<br>
in the solvents used in the polymerization reaction.<br>
This result can be obtained by using, in the<br>
polymerization environment, particularly effective<br>
substances for removing impurities characterized by<br>
the presence of active hydrogens, as<br>
trialkylaluminium compounds, in particular<br>
trimethylaluminium,	triethylaluminium,<br>
triisobutylaluminium and diisobutylaluminium monohydride. These substances do not participate directly in the catalytic process, but are capable of effectively capturing the above mentioned poisons, when used at concentrations of about 10"^-lO"* M in the polymerization environment.<br>
The catalytic system of the present invention can be applied to polymerization reactions in slurry phase (in which a dispersant is used, for example, propane  or  butane),   and  to   polymerization<br><br>
essentially carried out in the absence of solvents (as solvent-free polymerization in liquid phase). Of course, the catalyst of the invention can be applied to continuous or batchwise polymerization.<br>
When batchwise polymerization is carried out, the reaction time, as a function of temperature and concentration, is generally comprised within the range of from 10 minutes to 10 hours, preferably of from 30 minutes to 120 minutes.<br>
The polymerization temperature is approximately comprised within the range of from -78°C to 200°C, preferably of from -20°C to 100°C, still more preferably of from 10°C to 70°C. No particular limits exist on olefin pressure in the reaction system, although, preferably, the pressure is comprised within the range of from atmopsheric pressure up to 50 kg/cm^ G.<br>
In the polymerization process, the molecular weight can be controlled by means of any known methods, for example by suitably selecting polymerization temperature and pressure, and adding hydrogen.<br>
At the end of the polymerization process, the produced elastomer leaving the reactor is recovered in various ways, for example by submitting it to a stripping treatment, preferably with water by steam stripping, in order to remove non-converted monomers and the possibly used diluent. This operation can be followed by a treatment on the extruder, by means of which water and possible residual olefin traces are<br><br>
removed.<br>
When preparing EPDM's is desired, the useful dienes for preparing EPDM terpolymers are selected from:<br>
•	straight-chain dienes, as 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene;<br>
•	branched dienes, as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene<br>
•	single-ring cyclic dienes, as 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene/ 1,5-cyclododecadiene;<br>
•	dienes with bridge-condensed rings, as dicyclopentadiene; bicyclo[2.2.1]epta-2,5-diene; alkenyl-, alkylidene-, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes, as 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-propenyl-2-norbornene.<br>
Among non-conjugated dienes tipically used for preparing these copolymers, those dienes are preferred which contain at least one double bond, in a stretched ring, still more preferably 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) and furthermore 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene.<br>
In the case of EPDM terpolymers, the amount of dienic monomer should not exceed 15 % by weight and should preferably be comprised within the range of from 2 to 10 % by weight.<br>

The characterization of the copolymers produced<br>
iccording to the present invention was carried out<br>
aainly by determining the propylene content in the<br><br>
/<br>
solid polymer and the bulk viscosity, as determined by measuring Mooney viscosity on the pristine copolymer. The mechanical properties of the products were determined by submitting the copolymers to vulcanization. For all of these analyses, the corresponding method used and, when available, the method reported in technical literature, are supplied in the following.<br>
The determination of the contents of propylene and optional diene is carried out (according to a method developed by the present Applicant) via IR on the polymers in film form with a thickness of 0.2 mm, using a Perkin-Elmer FTIR spectrophotometer model 17 60 (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy).<br>
Viscosity [Mooney viscosity (1+4)] is determined at 100°C by using a Monsanto "1500 S" viscometer, according to ASTM method D 1646/68.<br>
As regards the determination of the mechanical properties, these analyses were carried out on vulcanized copolymers. In the following, the vulcanization compound formulation and the dynamic-mechanical determinations carried out according to the corresponding DIN methods, are reported. A)   Vulcanization<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
The preparation is reported of an elastomeric copolymer according to the present invention, obtained from metallocene A and methylalumoxane, by preparing the catalytic system according to the "preliminary formation method", as discussed in the general section.<br>
The polymerization is carried out inside a pressure reactor of 3.3 litres of capacity, thermostatted and equipped with magnetic stirring<br><br>
means. The reactor is purged with 1 1 of anhydrous "polymerization grade" propylene containing (by weight/volume) 5 % of aluminium triisobutyl (TIBA) , the mixture is vented, the reaction is washed again with fresh propylene and is then emptied. By keeping temperature at 23°C, 2 litres of propylene are charged to the reactor, then 5 ml (1.5 x 10"^' moles) is added of a 0.3 M solution of TIBA in hexane, and the reactor is then heated up to the polymerization temperature, of 45''C. Through a dipleg ethylene gas is injected in order to obtain an 8 % concentration by mol in the liquid phase, and the mixture of monomers is kept at 45°C during 30 minutes.<br>
Inside a Schlenk tube, kept under nitrogen, the solution of catalyst is prepared by adding, in the order shown, 10 ml of toluene, 1.2 ml (1.82 x 10"^ moles) of an 1.5 M solution of methylalumoxane Eurecene 5100 lOT ex firm Witco, 0.6 ml (1.1 x 10'*^ moles) of an 1.9 x lO"'^ M solution of metallocene A in toluene. The molar ratio of aluminium:zirconium results hence to be of 1650. The so formed catalyst solution is kept at room temperature during 10 minutes and is then poured, under an inert gas flow, into a metal container from which, by means of a nitrogen overpressure, it is transferred to the reactor containing the monomers to be polymerized, caring of washing the container with 10 ml of toluene containing 1.2 ml (1.82 x 10"^ moles) of the same 1.5 M methylaluminoxane solution previously used. The end value of methyl alumoxane:Zr ratio<br><br>
results hence to be of 3300. The polymerization reaction is carried out at 45°C caring of keeping ethylene pressure constant by continuously feeding ethylene from a cylinder charged to a balance, which allows the absorbed monomer weight to be monitored throughout the polymerization reaction. After 1 hour, ethylene feed is discontinued, the residual monomers are vented off and the autoclave is rapidly cooled down to room temperature. 185 g of polymer is recovered, with a catalyst activity of 2100 kg of polymer per g of zirconium metal. On the solid material, dried and homogenized on a roller mill, the normal physical-chemical analyses are carried out which show a propylene content in the polymer of 42 %, by weight, a Mooney viscosity of &gt; 120, a weight average molecular weight (M„) of 5.6 x 10^ and a molecular weight dispersion (M„/Mn) of 2.5. EXAMPLES 2-11<br>
The polymerizations have been carried out according to the operating modalities of Example 1. Test conditions and results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The examples show that the catalytic systems obtained by starting from metallocenes according to the present invention are active to produce elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymers with high values of Mooney viscosity.<br>
Examples 2, 3, 5, 8-10 also show how the viscosity of the resulting elastomers can be easily controlled by using metered hydrogen amounts during the polymerization reaction.<br><br>
In example 8 metallocene G is used; the synthesis of the latter is reported in the following.<br>
Synthesis of o-xylene-a,a'-bis-[T]^-(3,5, 6-trimethyl)-inden-1-yl] zirconium dichloride (metallocene G). Synthesis of 1,5,6-trimethylindene.<br>
Crotonyl chloride, 140 g (1.34 moles), dissolved in 150 g (1,41 moles) of o-xylene is added to the suspension of 210 g (1.57 moles) of aluminium trichloride in 800 ml of methylene chloride, kept at the temperature of 10°C, during approximately 2 hours. When addition is complete, temperature is allowed to rise up to reach room temperature value, and the reaction mixture is kept with stirring during further 2 hours. The mixture is hydrolysed with ice-water and the organic phase is washed with water until neutral, then is dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to dryness. The obtained residue is added to 1 1 of concentrated H2SO4 and the resulting mixture is kept heated at 80°C during 1.5 hours. After cooling, the resulting mixture is poured on ice and is extracted with ethyl ether. The ethereal phase is washed with water and then with saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, until neutral. The resulting solution is dried over sodium sulfate and ether is evaporated off. 210 g is obtained (yield 90 %) of a mixture of isomeric indanones, as a dark oil.<br>
To  the  solution  of  210  g  of  indanone<br><br>
derivatives dissolved in a mixture of 700 ml of THF and 350 ml of MeOH, solid sodium boron hydride (30 g) is added during 1.5 hours, with temperature being kept at 10"C. At the end, the reaction mixture is kept with stirring for a further hour. The reaction mixture is poured into ice-water and is extracted with ethyl ether. The ethereal extract is washed with water until neutral; it is then dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent is evaporated off, with 205 g being obtained of a mixture of isomeric indanols (yield 96 %) . The residue is crystallized by dissolving it in 1 litre of hot heptane. 786 g is obtained (yield 36 %) of 3,5,6-trimethyl-l-indanol 96 % pure according to chromatographic analysis.<br>
An amount of 100 g of silica (230-400 mesh) is added to 76 g (0.432 moles) of 3,5,6-trimethyl-l-indanol, dissolved in 800 ml of toluene and 800 ml of heptane. The resulting mixture is kept refluxing for 4 hours with formed water being distilled off. At the end, the reaction mixture is filtered and silica is washed with petroleum ether. After evaporating the solvent, the residue is distilled under vacuum and the fraction boiling at 115-116°C/25 mm Hg is collected.<br>
42  g  is  obtained of  1,5,6-trimethyl-indene (yield 80 %).<br>
Synthesis of a,a'-bis{3,5,6-trimethylinden-l-yl)-o-xylene.<br>
52 ml (0.130 moles) of alkyl lithium in hexane is added to a solution of 20 g (0.128 moles) of<br><br>
/ 1,5,6-trimethylindene in 200 ml of THF, during approximately 30 minutes. The resulting mixture is kept 1 hour with stirring at approximately 35'C. A yellow-green solution is obtained. Upon cooling down to -70"C, yellow lithium salt precipitates. 16.8 g (0.064 moles) of a,a'-dibromo-o-xylene dissolved in 100 ml of THF is added during about 1.5 hours. During the addition, the precipitate dissolves, and, at the end of the addition, a colourless, clear solution is obtained. Temperature is allowed to rise up to room value and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand under these conditions during 2 hours. The reaction mixture is then hydrolysed with water and extracted with ethyl ether. After water washing until neutral and after being desiccated over sodium sulfate, the ethereal extract is evaporated. 28 g is thus obtained of a colourless, thick oil. Upon crystallization at -15°C from 100 ml of petroleum ether containing 3 ml of methanol, 15 g is obtained of a,a'-bis(3,5,6-trimethylinden-l-yl)-o-xylene. By purifying the residue obtained by evaporating mother liquors, on a silica gel column using petroleum ether as the eluent, a further 10 g is recovered of pure product (total yield 93 %).<br>
