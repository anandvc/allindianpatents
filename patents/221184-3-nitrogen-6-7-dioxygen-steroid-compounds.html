"3-NITROGEN-6,7-DIOXYGEN STEROID COMPOUNDS"<br>
INFLAZYME PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED, of Suite 425, 5600 Parkwood Way, Richmond, British Columbia V6V 2M2, Canada,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to 3-nitrogen-6,7-dioxygen steroid compounds.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention is directed towards 3-arnino-6,7-dioxygenated steroids, compositions including these steroids, and therapeutic uses related thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Inflammatory Response (Inflammation)<br>
Inflammation is an essential localized host response to invading microorganisms or tissue injury which involves cells' of the immune system. The classic signs of inflammation include redness (erythema), swelling (edema), pain and increased heat production (pyrema) at the site of injury. The inflammatory response allows the body to specifically recognize and eliminate an invading organism and/or repair tissue injury. Many of the acute changes at the site of inflammation are either directly or indirectly attributable to the massive influx of leukocytes (eg., neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) which is mtrinsic to this response. Leukocytic infiltration and accumulation in tissue results in their activation and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators such as LTB4, prostaglandins, TNF-a, IL-lβ, IL-8, IL-5, IL-4, histamine, proteases and reactive oxygen species for example.<br>
Normal inflammation is a highly regulated process that is tightly controlled at several levels for each of the cell types involved in the response. For example, expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a is controlled at the level of gene expression, translation, post-translational modification and release of the mature form from the cell membrane. Many of the proteins up-regulated during inflammation are controlled by the transcription factor, NF-KB. Pro-inflammatory responses are countered in some instances by endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as generation of IL-10. A characteristic of a normal inflammatory response is that it is temporary in nature and is followed by a resolution phase which brings the state of the tissue back to its prior condition. The resolution phase is thought to involve up-regulation of anti-inflammatory mechanisms, such as IL-10, as well as down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory processes.<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br>
Inflammatory Disease<br>
Inflammatory disease occurs when an inflamatory response is initiated that is inappropriate and/or does not resolve in the normal manner but rather persists and results in a chronic inflammatory state. Inflamatory disease may be systemic (e.g., lupus) or localized to particular tissues or organs and exerts an enormous personal and economic burden on society. Examples of some of the most common and problematic inflammatory diseases include asthma, allergy, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, emphysema, colitis, graft vs host disease, contact dermatitis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Other disease states such as immunodeficiency diseases are now known to be associated with altered regulation of the chemokme/cytokine network and their receptors, which can alter viral replication and AIDS pathogenesis.<br>
Many of the tissue, cellular and biochemical processes which are perturbed in inflammatory disease have been elucidated and this has allowed the development of experimental models or assays to mimic the disease state. These in-vitro and in-vivo assays enable selection and screening of compounds with a high probability of therapeutic efficacy in the relevant inflammatory disease. For example, the ability of a compound to inhibit the allergen-induced accumulation of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and lymphocytes in the lavage fluid obtained from sensitized animals is indicative of anti-asthma activity. In particular, this model system is useful in the evaluation of the effects of compounds in the treatment of the late phase response and hyper-responsiveness that is characteristic of asthma, when lung inflammation is apparent<br>
Asthma and Allergy<br>
Asthma and allergy are closely related with good evidence from clinical studies demonstrating a strong correlation between the severity of asthma and the degree of atopy (allergy). Sensitization to allergens is believed to be the most important risk factor for asthma in both children and adults, with approximately 90% of asthma cases exhibiting atopy.<br>
Allergy is characterized by an increased blood serum IgE (antibody) level. Repeated exposure to allergens, in a process called sensitization, is normally required to trigger atopy and the subsequent asthmatic or allergic response. Once B cells are exposed to allergens, they produce antibodies which bind to the surface of mast cells. The crosslinking of two antibodies by the antigen causes a series of reactions resulting in degranulation and the release of a number of mediators which modulate the<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br>
inflammatory response. Mediators that are released or generated during the asthmatic and allergic response include histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, cytokines and tryptase.<br>
Asthma is characterized by hyperresponsiveness of the airways, episodic periods of bronchospasm and chronic inflammation of the lungs. Obstruction of the . 5 airways is reversible with time or in response to drug therapies. Patients exhibiting normal airflow may be hyperreactive to a variety of naturally occurring stimuli, e.g., cold air, exercise, chemicals and allergen. The most common event initiating an asthmatic response is an immediate hypersensitivity to common allergens including ragweed pollen, grass pollen, various fungi, dust mites, cockroaches and domestic 10 animals. The symptoms of the disease include chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing. Asthma incidence and mortality has been increasing worldwide, doubling over the past 20 years despite modem therapies.<br>
The responses of the airways to allergen is complex and consists of an early asthmatic response (EAR) which peaks 20-30 min after exposure to the stimuli, is 15 characterized by bronchoconstnction and normally resolves after 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The late asthmatic response (LAR) generally occurs 3-8 hours after initial exposure, and involves both bronchoconstnction and the development of inflammation and edema in the lung tissue. This inflammation often becomes chronic, with epithelial damage occurring and infiltration of the lungs with inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and neutrophils.<br>
20    Current Treatments for Asthma<br>
Glucocorticoids (steroids) are the most effective long-term therapy for the treatment of asthma. For example, due to the presence of airway inflammation even in mild asthma, inhaled steroids are used even in early stage drug therapy. Although steroids are effective anti inflammatories they are not very useful for the control of<br>
25 acute asthma attacks. Orally delivered steroids are associated with significant side-effects and consequently their chronic use in the control of asthma is minimal. Combination therapy is often employed for orally delivered steroids, where combination therapy may be divided into the following areas: anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g.,  inhaled  and  oral  steroids), bronchodilators,  (e.g.,  β2-agonists,  xanthines,<br>
30 anticholinergics), and mediator inhibitors {e.g., cromolyns and leukotnene antagonists). In general, moderate to severe asthma patients are poorly served by the present armamentarium of drugs. Drugs that are safe are only marginally effective, while effective drugs have unacceptable side effects with extensive monitoring of patients required.   Products under development continue to meet challenges related to side-<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br><br>
effects (e.g., emesis side-effects characteristic of certain phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors) and poor pharmacokinetic and metabolism parameters. There is a significant need for therapeutic agents that achieve safe and effective treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma and allergy. The present invention provides these and related benefits as described herein.<br>

15 useful in the treatment and/or prevention of various disease conditions. For example, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating and/or preventing an inflammatory disease. The method includes administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (1) or phaimaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, stereoisomer or prodrug thereof, or an effective amount of a composition<br>
20    containing a compound of formula (1) or phaimaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, stereoisomer or prodrug thereof.<br>
Before describing the invention in further detail, certain definitions as used herein are provided with the following definitions, and certain conventions used herein are also set forth.<br>
25    A.       Definition of terms<br>
As used herein, the following terms have the indicated meaning, unless clearly indicated otherwise.<br>
"Alkyl" is a monovalent, saturated or unsaturated, straight, branched or cyclic, aliphatic (ie., not aromatic) hydrocarbon group. In various embodiments, the 30 alkyl group has 1-20 carbon atoms, ie.y is a C1-C20 (or C1-C20 group, or is a C1-C18 group, a C1-C12 group, a C1-C6 group, or a C1-C4 group. Independently, in various embodiments, the alkyl group: has zero branches (ie., is a straight chain), one branch, two branches, or more than two branches; is saturated; is unsaturated (where an<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br>
unsaturated alkyl group may have one double bond, two double bonds, more than two double bonds, and/or one triple bond, two triple bonds, or more than two triple bonds); is, or includes, a cyclic structure; is acyclic. Exemplary alkyl groups include C1alkyl<br><br><br>
"Aryl" is a monovalent, aromatic, hydrocarbon, ring system. The ring system may be monocyclic or fused polycyclic (e.g., bicyclic, tricyclic, etc.). In various embodiments, the monocyclic aryl ring is C5-C10, or C5-C7, or C5-C6, where these . carbon numbers refer to the number of carbon atoms that form the ring system. A C6 ring system, i.e., a phenyl ring is a preferred aryl group. In various embodiments, the polycyclic ring is a bicyclic aryl group, where preferred bicyclic aryl groups are C8-C12, or C9-C10. A naphthyl ring, which has 10 carbon atoms, is a preferred polycyclic aryl group.<br>
"Heteroalkyl" 'is an alkyl group (as defined herein) wherein at least one of the carbon atoms is replaed with a heteroatom. Preferred heteroatoms are nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogen. A heteroatom may, but typically does not, have the same number of valence sites as carbon. Accordingly, when a carbon is replaced with a heteroatom, the number of hydrogens bonded to the heteroatom may need to be increased or decreased to match the number of valence sites of the heteroatom. For instance, if carbon (valency of four) is replaced with nitrogen (valence of three), then one of the hydrogens formerly attached to the replaced carbon must be deleted. Likewise, if carbon is replaced with halogen (valence of one), then three (i.e., all) of the hydrogens formerly bonded to the replaced carbon must be deleted.<br>
"Heteroaryl"is a monovalent aromatic ring system containing carbon and at least one heteroatom in the ring.    The heterbaryl group may, in various embodiments, have one heteroatom, or 1-2 heteroatoms, or 1-3 heteroatoms, or 1-4 heteroatoms in the ring. Heteroaryl rings may be monocyclic or polycyclic, where the polycyclic ring may contained fused, spiro or bridged ring junctions.     In one embodiment, the heteroaryl is selected from monocyclic and bicyclic.   Monocyclic heteroaryl rings may contain from about 5 to about 10 member atoms (carbon and heteroatoms), preferably from 5-7, and most preferably from 5-6 member atoms in the ring.  Bicyclic heteroaryl rings may contain from about 8-12 member atoms, or 9-10 member atoms in the ring. the heteroaryl ring may be unsubstituted or substituted. In<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br>

one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring is unsubstituted.   In another embodiment, the<br>
heteroaryl ring is substituted.    Exemplary heteroaryl groups include benzofuran,<br>
benzothiophene, furan, imidazole, indole, isothiazole, oxazole, piperazine, pyrazine,<br>
pyrazole, pyridazine, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrole, quinoline, thiazole and thiophene.<br>
5    	"Heteroatom" is a halogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, silicon or<br>
sulfur atom.    Groups containing more than one heteroatom may contain different heteroatoms.<br>
"Hydrocarbons" are chemical groups formed exclusively of hydrogen and carbon; "Halocarbons" are chemical groups formed exclusively of halogen and 10    carbon; and "Hydrohalocarbons" are chemical groups formed exclusively of hydrogen, halogen, and carbon.<br>
"Organic groups" and "Organic moieties" are used synonymously, and refer to stable structures having the indicated number and type of atoms.<br>
'pharmaceutically acceptable salt" and "salts thereof in the compounds 15    of the present invention refers to acid addition salts and base addition salts.<br>

15	The compounds of the present invention are intended as pharmaceutical<br>
agents. Preferably, the molecular weight of a compound of the invention is relatively small, that is, less than about 5,000 g/mol, typically less than 4,000 g/mol, more typically less than 3,000 g/mol, still more typically less than 2,000 g/mol, yet more typically less than 1,000 g/mol, where the minimum molecular weight of a compound 20 of the invention is about 300 g/mol, and each of these typical ranges is a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The    steroid    compounds    of    the    present    invention    include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, stereoisomers and prodrugs of the 3-nitrogen-6,7-dioxygenated steroid structures described above, in isolation or in mixtures 25    with one another.<br>
The steroid compounds of the invention may, and typically do, exist as solids, including crystalline solids which can be crystallized from common solvents such as ethanol, N,N-dimethyl-formamide, water, or the like. The crystallization process may, depending on the crystallization conditions, provide various polymorphic 30 structures. Typically, a more thermodynamically stable polymorph is advantageous to the commercial scale manufacture of a steroid compound of the invention, and is a preferred form of the compound.<br>
Often, crystallizations produce a solvate of the steroid compound having<br>
the structure shown above. As used herein, the term "solvate" refers to an aggregate<br>
35    that comprises one or more 3-nitrogen-6,7-dioxygenated steroid compounds of the<br><br>

invention, with one or more molecules of solvent The solvent may be water, in winch case the solvate may be a hydrate. Alternatively, the solvent may be an organic solvent Thus, the compounds of the present invention may exist as a hydrate, including a monohydrate,;dihydrate, hemihydrate, sesquihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the 5 like, as well as the corresponding solvated forms. The steroid compounds may be true solvates, while in other cases, the steroid may merely retain adventitious water or be a mixture of water plus some adventitious solvent.<br>
As used herein, a "pharmaceutically acceptable solvate" refers to a solvate that retains the biological effectiveness and properties of the biologically active 10 3-nitrogen-6,7-dioxygenated steroid compounds of the invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. 15 Sykes, P. A., Guidebook to Mechanism in Organic Chemistry, 6th Ed (1986, John Wiley. &amp; Sons, N.Y.) is an exemplary reference that describe solvates.<br>
The inventive compounds may exist as single stereoisomers, racemates<br>
and/or mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers.  All such single stereoisomers,<br>
racemates and mixtures thereof are intended to be within the scope of the present<br>
20    invention. In a preferred aspect, the inventive compounds are used in optically pure<br>
form.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is intended to mean a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active 3-nitrogen-6,7-dioxygenated steroid compound as described above. 25 Thus, the term "prodrug" refers to a metabolic precursor of a steroid compound of the present invention that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject but is converted in vivo to an active 3-nitrogen-6*,7-dioxygenated steroid compound of the invention. Prodrugs are typically rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formulae, for example, 30    by hydrolysis in blood.<br>
A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, "Pro¬drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," Vol 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by 35    reference. A typical prodrug is a derivative of the steroid compounds of the invention<br><br>

which have chemically or metabolicaUy cleavable groups and become, by solvolysis or under physiological conditions, the compounds of the invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. The prodrug derivative form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). A preferred prodrug is a compound having substitution at the 3-natrogen atom of the steroids of the invention, where the substitution is cleaved in vivo to provide a pharmaceutically active compound.<br>
Steroids of the present invention having C3 nitrogen substitution and oxygen substitution at positions 6 and 7 have unexpected properties that enhance the efficacies of these compounds. For instance, the steroid of the present invention have an excellent metabolic stability in S9 fractions from human liver. For example, 100% of compounds 28, 89, 139, and 143 remains unchanged after 15 and even 30 minutes incubation with human S9 fractions.   It was an unexpected finding that C3 nitrogen substitutions significantly decrease glucuronidation of the molecules in plasma.   In addition, steroids of the present invention having C3 nitrogen substitutions such as compounds 28, 89 and 83 are highly soluble in aqueous solution, demonstrating a solubility of &gt;100 mg/ml in water.   Furthermore, the potency and pharmacokinetic profile of steroids of the present invention with C3 nitrogen substitutions is highly suitable for therapeutic application.  Doses of

The stereochemistry at C3 can be inverted to give 3β-ammonium salt derivatives of any number of compounds related to compound 49. The stereochemistry at C3 can be inverted in 3 synthetic steps as shown in Scheme 8 for the synthesis of compounds 28 and 83. The 3|3-hydroxyl compound 46 is converted to the 3β-mesylate 20    81 using methanesulfonyl chloride and pyridine.   Heating compound 81 and cesium acetate in 100°C DMF gives the 3α-acetate compound 82. The inversion sequence is completed by methanolysis of the acetate in compound 82 using sodium methoxide to give the 3cc-hydroxyl compound 25.   Treatment of compound 25 with ZnN6-2py,   triphenylphosphine and D1AD in toluene produced the 3β-azddo compound 26.

UTILITY EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE A<br>
EFFECT OF SELECTED COMPOUNDS ON ALLERGEN-INDUCED LUNG INFLAMMATION<br>
5	The ability of a compound to inhibit the allergen-induced accumulation<br>
of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and neutrophils in the lavage fluid obtained from sensitized animals is indicative of that compound's anti-asthma activity. In particular, this model system is useful in the evaluation of the effects of a test compound in the treatment of the late phase response of asthma, when lung 10 inflammation and the second phase of bronchoconstriction is apparent. The test is conducted as follows.<br>
Male Brown Norway rats are sensitized to ovdbumin by single<br>
intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg ovalbumin adsorbed to 100 mg Al(OH)3 (alum) in 1 ml<br>
sterile saline (saline control rats receive only sterile saline) on day 1, and allowed to<br>
15 sensitize until day 21. Test compounds are given orally q.d. for three days prior to<br>
challenge (days 19, 20, 21), and one day post challenge (day 22), with the third dose<br>
given 2 hours before challenge, and the fourth day dose given 24 hours after challenge<br>
(volume = 300 μl/dose). Rats are challenged with 0.5% ovalbumin in saline generated<br>
using a Devillbis nebulizer for 60 min on day 21.<br>
20	Forty-eight hrs after challenge, animals are sacrificed with an overdose<br>
of intraperitoneally-delivered sodium pentobarbitol and the lungs are lavaged with cold 2x7 ml phosphate buffered saline. The recovered lavage fluid is placed on ice. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The pellet is resuspended in phosphate buffered saline at 4°C. Cytospins are prepared and stained 25    for differentiation and enumeration of cell types.<br>
The protective effects of the various test compounds on allergen induced lung inflammation are summarized in Tables 7 and 8. The dose response activity of select compounds is shown in Table 9. Test compound was administered in 300 μl com oil (Tables 7 and 8) or water (Table 9), which were used as vehicles. Control animals 30 received 300 μl com oil or water alone, te. no drug. Values in Tables 7,8, and 9 represent percent inhibition of leukocyte accumulation relative to control annuals. A negative value in Table 7,8, or 9 indicates an exacerbation of the effect over the control animal.<br><br>

EXAMPLE B EFFECT OF COMPOUND 83 ON IRRTCANT-JNDUCED MOUSE EAR EDEMA<br>
A number of mice are uniquely identified by placing a mark with an indelible marker on their tail. Mice are dosed orally with 15 mg/kg test compound in 100 μl of 45% β-cyclodextrin in saline. Mice are briefly anaesthesized with 2% halothane, and 2 μg of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in 25 μl of acetone is applied to the inner and outer sides of the left ear of the mouse. Acetone is applied to the right ear of the mouse in the same manner to serve as a vehicle control. Control animals receive the same treatment but without any test compound. After 3 hours, mice are sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and a standard sized biopsy is excised from the ears and weighed to the nearest 1/10th of a mg. Data are analyzed by taking the difference of each left ear from the right ear, and then calculating the % inhibition of edema by (((mean Rx/mean irritant))xl00)-100.<br>
The compounds of the present invention demonstrate protective effects on irritant induced mouse ear edema. For example, compound 83 inhibits irritant-induced mouse ear edema by 38% compared to control animals.<br>
EXAMPLE C EFFECT OF COMPOUNDS ON THE RELEASE OF HEXOSAMINIDASE FROM A RAT MAST CELL •<br>
LINE(RBL-2H3) The anti-allergic effects of a compound of the present invention was evaluated by measuring its effect on antigen-induced secretion of hexosaminidase from a passively sensitized rat mast cell line. The ability of a test compound to inhibit the<br><br>
 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br>
release of mast cell granule contents, e.g., histamine and hexosaminidase, is indicative<br>
of the anti-allergy and/or anti-asthma activity of the compound.   Hexosaminidase is<br>
released from the mast cell granule along with histamine and other mediators during<br>
antigen challenge. The test is performed as follows.<br>
5	RBL-2H3 cells are grown in culture and passively sensitized for 1 hour<br>
at 37°C to dinitrophenol (DNP) using anti-human-DNP (IgE). Cells-are incubated with test compound for 30 minutes at 37°C and stimulated with 0.5 ug/ml DNP-HSA (antigen) for 30 minutes. Aliquots of the supematant are removed and used to measure the amount of hexosaminidase released during challenge with the antigen. The amount 10 of hexosaminidase present in the supematant is determined colorimetrically by monitoring the enzymatic metabolism of p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosarninide (p-NAG) over a period of 60 rninutes at 405 nin. The effect of each test compound is determined as a percentage of the antigen-induced response (minus background release) obtained in the presence of DMSO alone. These values are used to determine the 15    degrees of inhibition of antigen-induced hexosaminidase release from the cells.<br>
The compounds of the present invention demonstrate the ability to<br>
inhibit hexosaminidase release in response to antigen stimulation.   Compounds were<br>
tested at 0.3, 3, 10 and 30 μM, and the IC50 calculated.  This data is summarized in<br>
Tables 1-6. For example, compound 119 at 6.1 μM inhibits hexosaminidase release by<br>
20    50% in response to antigen stimulus.<br>
EXAMPLE D METABOLIC STABILITY OF SELECTED COMPOUNDS IN HUMAN S9 FRACTIONS<br>
The therapeutic effectiveness of a test compound can be often directly 25 related to its metabolic stability in vivo. The majority of known, marketed drugs are metabolized by a group of enzymes known as P450 enzymes. The S9 fraction of human liver contains all the P450 enzymes and also cytoplasmic enzymes that may be involved in the metabolism of new chemical entities. Metabolism in vitro using human S9 fractions is a standard assay to evaluate relative metabolic stability of new 30    compounds. The test is performed as follows.<br>
Reagents are thawed on ice and combined to make up a Master Mix as<br>
follows:  Potassium phosphate (100 mM, pH 7), G6P (0.25 mM), G6PDH (2 U/ml ),<br>
NADPH (1 mM), UDP (0.25 mM), APPS (0.25 mM), and S9 fraction (2 mg/ml). A<br>
volume of 498 μ1 of the Master mix is dispensed into each microcentrifuge tube. A<br>
35    volume of 2 μl of 2.5 mM test compound (final concentration of 10 uM) is dispensed<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/00581<br><br><br>
into the center of the lid of the appropriate tube, and the lids gently closed to prevent mixing. Synchronous combination of test compound and master mix is achieved by simultaneous ten times inversion of the tubes, which are then incubated at 37°C and shaken at 150 rpm for the appropriate incubation times. While incubation is in progress, 5 all 0 time samples are mixed individually by three times inversion followed by the immediate addition of 500 μl ice cold acetonitrile with three timerinversion to stop the reaction. Immediately after each 15 minutes and 30 minutes, incubation is complete, ice cold acetonitrile is added to each tube and the tubes mixed by three times inversion. All sample tubes are incubated at -80°C for a minimum of 15 minutes, thawed and remixed<br>
10 by inversion. Aliquots of 650 pi are transferred to Chromatographic Specialties micro-spin filter system tubes (0.2 urn nylon membrane, C618505) and centrifixged at 13,000 rpm for 48 seconds. The sample filtrates are stored at -80°C.<br>
Sample filtrates are analyzed on LCMS, and percent remaining after 15 and 30 minute incubation is calculated relative to the 0 minute incubation.<br>
15	The metabolic stability of various compounds are summarized in Table<br>
10 as the percent remaining after 15 or 30 minutes incubation with human liver S9 fractions.<br>

EXAMPLES SOLUBILITY OF SELECTED COMPOUNDS IN PHYSIOLOGICALLY COMPATIBLE<br>
FORMULATIONS<br>
5	Compounds of the present invention exhibit good water solubility. For<br>
example, compound 83 is soluble in water at 225 mg/ml. Compound 83 substituted with a hydroxyl at C3 has a solubility in water of less than 60 μg/mL Compounds 28 and 89 have solubilities at room temperature of ~30 mg/ml, which can be significantly increased by heating. This unexpected finding indicates that these 3-amino compounds 10    should be readily formulated into therapeutic compositions.<br>
EXAMPLEF EFFECT OF SELECTED TEST COMPOUNDS ON ANTIGEN-INDUCED CALCIUM FLUX<br>
Elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration is a common and crucial 15 event which follows the activation of many types of cell surface receptors. Increases in intracellular calcium that occur following agonist activation of inositol lipid hydrolysis are the results of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the influx of calcium through the plasma membrane. Increases in cytosolic calcium concentration are involved in many important cellular responses in the inflammatory process 20 including adhesion, motility, gene expression, proliferation, and degranulation. Changes in intracellular calcium concentrations can affect both short and long term cellular responses. An assay method to evaluate a test compound's impact on calcium flux is provided as follows.<br>
Jurkat clone E6.1 cells grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% 25 FBS and 2mM L-Glutamine are transferred to 50mL conical tubes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 900 RPM to form a cell pellet. The resulting supernatants are discarded and each pellet is washed in l0mL HBSS. Cell suspensions are accumulated and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 900 RPM to form a cell pellet. The resulting supernatant is discarded and the pellet is resuspended in HBSS at 1x107cells/mL. The cell suspension 30    is transferred to a 20mm petri dish and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 20 minutes.<br><br>

One volume of Fura 2AM is mixed to one volume of detergent Pluronic<br>
F127. Cells are labeled with 4μL of probe solution to each mL of cell suspension. The<br>
petri dish is wrapped in aluminum foil to protect from light and placed on a plate shaker<br>
for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>
5	The following steps are done in the laminar flow hood with the<br>
fluorescent lights turned off. The petri dish is removed from the shaker and the labeled cell suspension is transferred to a 15mL conical tube and washed twice with HBSS as above. The cell pellet is resuspended in 12mL HBSS and left wrapped in foil for 30 minutes at room temperature.  The labeled cell suspension is aliquoted (l00μl/well) 10    into a Dynex 96 well white opaque tissue culture plate.   50uL of each test sample is added to appropriate wells and are, incubated together for 10 minutes at 37°C in the Wallac 1920 Victor™ plate reader (test samples are prepared in HBSS at 20mM, final concentration is 20uM). Selected compounds were tested for dose related activity. Test samples and activator (anti-CD3 mAb at final concentration of 4 figAnL, PharMingen) 15     are added manually (50uL), such that the minimum time to acquire the first data point after stimulation is approximately 30 seconds. The calcium influx response to anti-CD3 mAb is measured as an "end point" assay. The entire plate is read in 100 seconds using a kinetic of 1 second per well.<br>
The plate is read before the addition of anti-CD3 to monitor non-specific<br>
20 effect of samples/drugs. Fluorescence emission is measured at 510nm with excitation<br>
alternating between 340 and 380 every second using an excitation/emission filter pair.<br>
Data from these dual wavelengths are represented as a ratio of 2 excitations<br>
wavelengths. This ratio is independent of intracellular dye and cell concentrations,<br>
enabling real comparison between experiments.<br>
25	The effect of selected compounds on calcium flux in antigen challenged<br>
Jurkat clone E6.1 cells is summarized in Tables 1-6. For example, compound 116 inhibited calcium by 60.9% at 20 uM. The IC50 for compound 119 is less than or equal to 10 uM when dose response activity was examined. This demonstrated substantial effect on calcium flux would be beneficial in any disease pathology for which calcium 30 is a significant second messenger or effector molecule, including but not limited to ischemia/reperfusion injury such as stroke or myocardial infarction, inflammatory diseases such as asthma or allergy, neural or muscular disorders such as Parkinson's disease or epilepsy, cardiac anhythmias, or hypertension.<br><br>

EXAMPLE G EFFECT OF SELECTED COMPOUNDS ON ALLERGEN-INDUCED CHANGES IN LUNG<br>
FUNCTION<br>
In asthma, the early response of the airways to allergen challenge is characterized by an immediate bronchoconstriction which peaks 20-30 min after exposure to the stimuli, and which normally resolves after approximately 2 hours. Anti¬inflammatories are not generally active bronchodilators and are not very effective in the control of acute asthmatic bronchoconstriction. This results in the need for combination therapy to treat both the bronchoconstriction and the inflammation.<br>
Cam-Hartley guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) in groups<br>
of 5-6 by exposure to an aerosolized solution of 1% OA in saline for 15 min on 2<br>
consecutive days via a DeVilbiss nebulizer, with an additional single intradermal<br>
injection of 3 ug OA in saline on Day 1. Animals were found to be at peak sensitivity<br>
to the antigen approximately 14 days after the initial exposure. On Day 14, the animals<br>
were initially anaesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg i.p.),<br>
weighed, and then maintained on 1% halothane delivered via a nose cone.   The left<br>
carotid artery was cannulated with PE90 tubing containing 200 U/ml heparin in saline.<br>
A tracheostomy was performed and a fluid-filled cannula (PE 160) was inserted<br>
approximately  7   cm  into  the  esophagus.      The   animal  was  positioned  in   a<br>
plethysmograph and the trachea attached to a fixed stainless steel tracheal tube in the<br>
body box. The carotid cannula was attached to a pressure transducer for monitoring of<br>
blood pressure and heart rate.    The guinea pig was paralyzed with pancuronium<br>
bromide (0.8 mg/kg) and ventilated with air at a frequency of 60 Hz and tidal volume of<br>
3 ml using a Harvard small animal ventilator.<br>
Data was collected for 20 sec periods at a sampling rate of 100 Hz on a computer-linked physiological recording system using DIREC physiological software and analyzed using ANADAT software. Pulmonary resistance and dynamic lung compliance values were obtained from the volume, flow and pressure signals according to the method of Von Neeguard &amp; Wirz (1927), using an isovolumetric multi-point regression model for analysis (Ludwig, Robatto, et al. 1991), and calculated as absolute changes in lung resistance (RL; cm H20/ml/s) or lung compliance (CDYN; ml/cmH20). Volume and pressure signals were calibrated before each set of experiments following standard procedures.<br><br>
WO 01/83512<br><br>
PCT/CA01/0O581<br><br>
Several lung function measurements were obtained over a 5-10 minute period to ensure a steady baseline, and then the animal was challenged with OA (2% in saline) administered in 6 tidal breaths as a nebulized aerosol at a flow rate of 5 L/min. Pulmonary and cardiovascular function was continually monitored throughout the experiment, although data was collected at specific time-points after antigen challenge (101,2,3, 4, 5, 10,20, and 30 min).<br>
Test compounds were administered under light halothane anesthesia by oral gavage (0.1-1.0 mg/kg/day q.d.) in 300 ul polyethylene glycol-200 for 4 days prior to challenge with the final dose administered 2 hours prior to antigen challenge.<br>
The protective effects of select test compounds on allergen induced bronchoconstriction are summarized in Figures 4 and 5. The duration of activity of Compound 89 is shown in Figures 6 and 7. Data is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. The inhibition of the bronchoconstriction by the test compounds would be beneficial in any disease where acute smooth muscle constriction in response to allergen challenge is manifest, such as asthma and allergy.<br>
