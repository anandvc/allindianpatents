The averaged value is renewed to compensate for deviation of the length values. The patent is more oriented towards detecting an abnormal flow of paper sheets and does not address the issue of presenting choices to the user or the issue of dispensing functionality.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
There are numerous apparatus for displaying and/or dispensing paper and like objects as already described earlier However, the presently available apparatus do not have the functionality ‘to display and/or dispense a collection of paper sheets of a variety of sizes and types in a flexible and variable configuration. More over, these apparatus do not give the user the choice to select the number of<br>
 <br>
sheets desired. Additionally, such apparatus do not prompt the administrator to supply additional sheets of a particular size or type of paper if the number of sheets of the particular size or type of paper falls below a pre-determined threshold.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a vending machine that enables a user to choose from a variety of sheets of different size and type based on his or her requirement through the use of a menu1 driven user interface. Additionally, the present invention incorporates a counting mechanism within the vending machine, which facilitates the user to specify and get the number of pages desired. Each user of the vending machine is prompted a user id and password before he or she starts using the vending machine. As a result, the individual consumption level of sheets for different users is tracked. This further helps in keeping track of consumption levels of sheets of different size and type. If the number of sheets of a particular size or type of paper falls below a pre-determined threshold, the administrator is prompted to supply additional sheets of that particular size or type of paper.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of dispensing paper sheets of different sizes and types in specified quantities using a vending machine comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) holding papers in plurality of input trays where each tray carry papers of a specific size and type;<br>
 <br>
(b)	authenticating the user of the vending machine by requesting the said user to enter a user id and password;<br>
(c)	requesting the user to choose from the list of available options for size, type and number of paper desired by the user by a menu driven user interface if the user is authenticated;<br>
(d)	taking and sending the specified number of sheets of the specified paper type from one of the input trays to an output tray as requested by the user;<br>
(e)	tracking continuously the number of sheets desired of the particular type of paper by using a sheet counter; and<br>
(f)	prompting a message to supply additional sheets of that particular size or type of paper if the number of sheets of a particular size or type of paper falls below a predetermined threshold.<br>
An initial stack counter counts the number of sheets present in each of the input trays as soon as the papers*are fed in the tray. The number of sheets of a particular type of paper is determined, by dividing the bulk weight of the particular type of paper by the weight of a single sheet of that paper. Determining the weight of a single sheet of paper is obtained by dividing the weight of the entire stack of papers obtained by the number of sheets inserted. The initial stack counter contains a digital weight meter that weighs each type of paper in each tray and the weight of a fixed number of sheets of the same paper type is ascertained. Tracking the number of sheets in the tray involves decrementing the number of sheets of the particular type of paper consumed during the course of operation of the vending device. The sheet counter counts the number of sheets requested by<br>
 <br>
the user from the tray, which contains the paper having size and type as chosen, by the user.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a vending machine for dispensing paper sheets of different sizes and types in specified quantities comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	plurality of input trays for holding papers where each tray carry papers of a specific size and type;<br>
(b)	means for authenticating the user of the vending machine by requesting the said user to enter a user id and password;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various* forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
 <br>
The present invention relates to vending machines and particularly to paper vending machines. The patent publication describes a system and a method for dispensing paper sheets of different types and sizes. Further, the paper vending machine consists of a weighing mechanism for counting a stack of sheets loaded into the vending machine. Additionally, the paper vending machine comprises a sensor to count the number of sheets being dispensed out. According to the invention, a user can dispense a particular type of sheet from the set of different types of sheets stored inside the vending machine. A user name and password is required to dispense the desired number of sheets. Further, the paper vending machine can keep a record of paper consumption of individual user. Moreover, the paper vending machine can also manage the inventory of the sheets.<br>
The objective of the invention is to provide a vending machine that enables a user to choose from a variety of sheets of different size and type based on his or her requirement through the use of a menu driven user interface. Another objective of the invention is to incorporate a counting mechanism within the vending machine which facilitates the user to get the number of pages desired. Another objective of the invention is to allow users to use the vending machine after entering a user id and password so that individual consumption level of sheets for different users is tracked. Yet another objective of the invention is to keep track of consumption levels of sheets of different size and type. If the consumption level of a particular size or type of pap^r falls beldw a predetermined threshold, the administrator is prompted to supply additional sheet of that particular size or type of paper.<br>
 <br>
The present inventidn provides a vending machine that enables a user to choose from a variety of type or size of paper. The vending machine comprises input trays for holding papers of different size and type, a menu driven user interface that provides a user the options of selecting available size and type of paper and options for specifying required quantity, an initial stack counter for determining the numbers of sheets fed by the administrator, a sheet counter for counting the numbers of sheets desired by the user and a single output tray. Each of the input trays contains paper of a particular size and type. The initial stack counter counts the number of sheets present in each of the input trays as soon as administrator feeds the papers in the tray according to the following principle. The initial stack counter contains a digital weight meter that can weigh the different types of paper. Initially, the administrator is asked to insert bulk amount of a particular type of paper and its weight is determined by the digital weight meter. Next, the weight of a fixed number of sheets of the same paper type is inserted and its weight is determined. Thus the weight of a single sheet of paper is determined by dividing the weight obtained with the number of sheets inserted. Finally, by dividing the bulk weight of the particular type of paper by the weight of a single sheet of that paper, the number of sheets of that particular type of paper is determined. The original number of sheets of a particular type of paper is continuously decremented by the number of sheets of the particular type of paper consumed during the course of operation of the vending device. As a result, the number of sheets of a particular type of paper is continuously kept track of. If the consumption level of the particular type of paper falls below a predetermined<br>
 <br>
threshold, the administrator is prompted to supply additional sheet of that particular type of paper. A menu driven user interface gives the users the options for currently available sizes and types of papers to choose from. Additionally, the user can request a specified number of sheets of a particular type of paper. The sheet counter then counts the number of sheets requested by the user from the Tray which contains the paper having size and type as chosen by the user. The sheet counter comprises a paper pulling mechanism with a sensor which can sense the paper movement and update a digital counter. An output tray is provided for collecting the chosen size or type of paper in the specified quantity.<br>
A user of the vending machine is first requested to enter a user id and password before he or she can start using the vending machine. Once the login details are provided by the user, a menu driven user interface requests the user to choose from the list of available options for size and type of paper desired by the user. Additionally, the user is also requested to specify the number of sheets desired of the particular type of paper. As already explained earlier, the number of sheets of a particular type of paper is continuously kept track of by using a sheet counter. The input trays hold the different types or sizes of paper. For example, as shown in the diagram the input tray 1 holds paper of type TypeT and size ‘ Size1\ Based on the choice given by the user, specified number of sheets of the specified paper type is taken from one of the input trays and sent to the output tray. Further, if the number of sheets of a particular size or type of paper falls below a predetermined threshold, the administrator is prompted to supply additional sheets of that particular size or type of paper.<br>
 <br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The present art replaces the time consuming manual tasks of organizing, counting and keeping an inventory of the available paper sheets of different sizes and types. Document handling and counting apparatus find wide-spread applications such as, for example, in printing stations and other commercial as well as industrial establishments and in institutions where it is desired to organize and count stacks of different sizes of sheets. The vending machine provides an accurate count of such sheets as desired by the user at high rates of speed. In the current scenario many organizations find it difficult to maintain the inventory of the paper sizes used in,the organization. The present invention helps in maintaining the inventory as well as organizing the workplace.<br>
Further, the present invention enables the administrator to keep track of number of sheets of different types or sizes of paper consumed. As a result, individual consumption levels for different users can be tracked. Additionally, the consumption levels of different types of paper can also be kept track of.<br>
