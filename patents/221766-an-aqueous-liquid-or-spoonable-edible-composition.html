COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SATIETY ENHANCING FOOD COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan  Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
Satiety Enhancing Food Compositions<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to food composition having an <br>
5 	enhanced satiety effect, particularly aqueous or spoonable compositions comprising a biopolymer thickening agent.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The incidence of obesity and the number of people considered<br>
10 overweight in countries where a so-called Western diet is adopted has drastically increased over the last decade. Since obesity and being overweight are generally known to be associated with a variety of diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and arthereosclerosis, this increase is a major<br>
15 health concern for the medical world and for individuals alike. Furthermore, being overweight is considered by the majority of the Western population as unattractive.<br>
This has led to an increasing interest by consumers in their <br>
20 	health and has created a demand for products that help to reduce or control daily caloric intake and/or control body weight and/or bodily appearance.<br>
Several solutions have been proposed to help individuals to <br>
25	control their weight. Among these solutions is the use of drugs e.g. to suppress the activity of enzymes in the digestive system. However the use of drugs is often not preferred unless strictly required for medical purposes.<br>
30 	Another proposed solution is to prescribe the individuals a specific diet, for example, a diet with a restricted caloric intake per day. A problem with these diets is that often they do<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
2<br>
not provide a healthy nutritional balance and/or they are difficult to accommodate in modern lifestyles.   Meal replacer products have also been proposed as part of a healthy diet in order to control or reduce body weight.  For <br>
5 	example, US 5,688,547 discloses a nutritional meal replacement composition comprising dietary fibre, protein, a cellulose gum and gel.<br>
These meal replacer products are generally products that are <br>
10	intended to be consumed as a single-serving food product, such as a bar, drink etc to replace one or two meals per day. The meal replacer products are designed such that on the one hand they provide a restricted caloric intake, but on the other hand they provide a healthy balance of nutritional ingredients and <br>
15 are convenient to incorporate into an individual's daily diet.<br>
However, a general problem with products intended to be used in a weight loss or weight maintenance plan, e.g. meal replacer products or low-calorie snacks, is that feelings of hunger may<br>
20 occur sooner than desired after consumption and/or the feeling of satiety obtained may not be as great as desired.  Both of these considerations may render it difficult for the individual to adhere to the plan or it may make it and/or the products used therein less appealing to consumers.<br>
25<br>
Recognising the demand for effective and convenient satiety-inducing food products, research has been carried out to try to address the problems associated with the above approaches to controlling or reducing body weight.<br>
30<br>
One approach to addressing the aforementioned problems has been to investigate the use of satiety agents  in food products  in<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
3<br>
order to increase the satiety effect obtained from consuming a food product comprising the satiety agents.<br>
WO 01/17541 discloses a composition comprising proteins, high<br>
5	 levels of calcium, medium or long chain fatty acids and a source of a proteinase inhibitor extracted from potatoes to promote satiety.<br>
WO 99/02041 discloses a food composition giving a prolonged <br>
10 	feeling of satiety and comprising a mixture of specific triglyceride oils and a food emulsifier.<br>
WO 01/17377 discloses uronic acid-containing polysaccharides cross-linked to each other to form a sponge-like structure that<br>
15	 dissolves poorly in water and gastro-intestinal fluids, and which are poorly reabsorbed, in order to provide a satiety effect.<br>
Another approach to reduce the feeling of hunger which has been<br>
20	suggested is to use the principle of the ileal brake. The ileal  brake principle itself is described by Gregg W. Van Citters in The Ileal Brake: A fifteen-year progress report, Current Gastronenterology Reports 1999, 1:4040-409 and which concerns the delivery of satiety agents to parts of the gut e.g the <br>
25 ileum, duodenum or jejunum.<br>
However, the above developments are generally complicated and/or expensive and/or not as effective as is desired.<br>
30 Another problem in the formulation of the above types of food<br>
products is that it is often not desirable to include ingredients which may create a negative impression on the consumer when<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
4<br>
declared on the pack, or, which are not suitable for incorporation in food products e.g. certain synthetic polymers.<br>
To provide simpler solutions to the problem of providing good<br>
5 	satiety effects, natural fibres have been disclosed for use in food compositions for the purpose of enhancing satiety.  US 4,198,400 discloses the use of dietary fibres in juice and soup compositions to aid a feeling of satiety.<br>
10 US 2003/0013679 and WO 02/096353 disclose a method of blunting the post-prandial glycemic response in humans by the use of an induced viscosity fibre system.  The systems comprise a lightly hydrolysed starch and a soluble dietary fibre source in amounts of at least 10%wt. Digestive enzymes act upon the lightly<br>
15 hydrolysed starch to produce an increase in viscosity of the system in vivo.<br>
WO 02/096223 also discloses a method of blunting the postprandial glycemic response in humans by feeding a dual induced <br>
20 	viscosity fibre system. The systems comprise a lightly hydrolysed starch and a mixture of an anionic soluble dietary fibre source and a neutral soluble dietary fibre source but exhibit a low gastic viscosity as defined according to the present invention.<br>
25 WO 92/09212 discloses liquid compositions consisting of a<br>
surfactant, water and a water soluble, non-ionic cellulose ether having a cloud point of no greater than 35Â°C. The compositions are disclosed to be suitable for use as a slimming aid.<br>
30 WO 00/67592 discloses methods of producing low viscosity<br>
glucomannan comprising compositions by mixing maltodextrin with konjac flour. This is said to provide for the conversion of a<br><br>

food or beverage product from an initial low viscosity substance to a high viscosity end-product.<br>
It is disclosed in the paper * Gastric Response to Increased Meal<br>
5 	Viscosity Assessed by Echo-Planar Magnetic Response in Humans" by Marciani et al, 2000 American Society for Nutritional Sciences, pl22-127 that high viscosity meals have a greater satiety effect than low viscosity meals. Meal viscosities of up to 11 Pa.s at zero shear are disclosed.<br>
10<br>
In the paper wEffect of meal viscosity and nutrients on satiety, intragastric dilution and emptying assessed by MRI" by Marciani et al, 2001 American Journal Physiology Gastrointestinal Liver Physiology, G1227-G1223, it is disclosed that higher nutrient,<br>
15 higher viscosity meals gave a greater feeling of fullness compared to lower nutrient, lower viscosity meals.<br>
US 5,688,547 discloses shakes, puddings or mousses comprising protein, cellulose gel and gum and dietary fibres including<br>
20 pectin, alginate, gum arabic and guar gum.<br>
EP-A-323,510 discloses a food composition comprising water-   soluble edible fibres and proteins which are reported to be useful for the prevention of over-eating. The dietary fibres and<br>
25 proteins are used in a ratio such that a gel is formed when an aqueous solution of the composition is in contact with gastric juice. The viscosity of the compositions also increases in the stomach but the figures show that the viscosity at about pH 4 is approximately 400 cp or 0.4 Pa.s.<br><br>

WO 01/56404 discloses that 0.01 to 5%wt of a low molecular weight polymannuronate derived from alginate may be used in a functional beverage.<br>
5 US 5,283,076 and US 5,324,526 disclose beverage formulations that may be used as health foods. The beverages preferably comprise 5-20%wt of low molecular weight alginates. Use of these alginates in the prevention of obesity is proposed.<br>
10 US 5,866,190 discloses beverages comprising up to 0.2%wt of a mixture of pectin and alginates as a stabiliser. The acidic beverages disclosed have a very low viscosity.<br>
US 2003/134027-A1 and US 2003/0118712-A1 disclose a method for <br>

A   liquid composition with a pH of more than 5 or 6 respectively and a viscosity below 50 m Pas or 600 m Pas respectively at a shear rate of 100s-1and 20Â°C and a viscosity of at least 125% of the aforementioned viscosity at pH 3 or 5 respectively and 37Â°C is <br>
20	disclosed. The compositions comprise pectin and/or alginate and calcium. The compositions of US 2003-134027 Al comprise less than l%wt of protein to provide for a low viscosity with a low caloric content and high translucency. The composition of US 2003-118712 A1 have been found to give low gastric viscosities according to <br>
25 the gastric viscosity method of the present invention.<br>
US 2003/125301 Al (see also WO 92/096223) and US 2002/0193344 disclose a method of blunting the post-prandial glycaemic response to a meal by feeding a subject a (dual) induced <br>
30 	viscosity fibre system. The compositions may comprise alginate and protein and have been found to give low gastric viscosities according to the gastric viscosity method of the present invention.<br><br>

Wolf et al in "Glycemic and insulinemic responses of non-diabetic healthy adult subjects to an experimental acid-induced viscosity complex incorporated into a glucose beverage", Nutrition, Volume <br>
15 	18, numbers 7/8, 2002, disclose an acid induced viscosity complex comprising alginates. The viscosity of the compositions tested (which did not comprise protein) rose between pH 5 and 4 but then showed a sharp decrease in viscosity at below 4.<br>
20 However, the satiety effect obtained by the above compositions is often not optimal, and/or may be provided by complicated systems, and thus there is still a need in the art for edible compositions that provide a good satiety effect for consumers, especially those wishing to control their calorie intake and/or body weight.<br>
25<br>
In particular, there is a need for compositions which provide good satiety effects, which are of acceptable taste and texture for the consumer, which are convenient and/or economical to manufacture and which are stable during manufacture and storage.<br>
30 This is especially applicable to meal replacement products or<br>
other calorie-controlled products intended to be consumed as part of a weight loss or weight control plan.<br><br>

The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems.<br>
5 In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide food products that have a good satiety effect. It is also an object of the invention to provide food products to be used in a method of preventing or treating obesity, especially human obesity.<br>
10 It is a further object of the invention to provide food products which address one or more of the above mentioned problems and which comprise conventional, preferably natural, food ingredients.<br>
15 It is a further object of the invention to provide food products, especially meal replacer products and products to be used in a weight loss or weight control plan, that have an improved satiety effect compared to conventional types of such food products.<br>
20 It is also an object of the invention to provide a method, and food products to be used therein, to aid an individual adhere to a weight loss or weight control plan (e.g. a calorie controlled diet), and/or to control body weight and/or to improve or maintain the perception of body image or body<br>
25 weight.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide food products which can be prepared by, and which are not substantially negatively affected by, conventional food processing and <br>
30  preparation techniques.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
Surprisingly we have now found that by including biopolymers in food compositions comprising protein and controlling the <br>
10	viscosity of those compositions under gastric conditions, excellent results are obtained, especially with respect to satiety effects. Furthermore the compositions can be produced by conventional food processing and preparation techniques and exhibit good stability.<br>
15<br>
Thus according to a first aspect, the present invention provides an aqueous liquid or spoonable edible composition comprising at least l%wt protein and from 0.1 to 5%wt of a biopolymer thickening agent which is not denatured or <br>
20 	hydrolysed between pH 2 and 4, and wherein the composition has<br>
a gastric viscosity at 0.1 s-1  and 37Â°C of at least 20 Pa.s and<br>
further wherein the gastric viscosity is greater than the viscosity of the composition.<br>
25 According to a second aspect, the invention provides the use of a biopolymer thickening agent which is not denatured or hydrolysed between pH 2 and 4 in the manufacture of an aqueous liquid or spoonable edible composition comprising at least l%wt<br>
protein and having a gastric viscosity at 0.1s  and 37Â°C of at <br>
30 	least 20 Pa.s and which viscosity is greater than the viscosity of the composition, for use in providing an enhanced feeling of satiety to a person consuming the edible composition and/or to<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
10<br>
aid adherence to a weight loss or weight control plan and/or in a method of preventing or treating obesity.<br>
According to a third aspect, the invention provides a method <br>
5  for inducing satiety in a human or animal, the method<br>
comprising the step of administering to a human or animal an aqueous liquid or spoonable edible composition comprising at least l%wt protein and from 0.1 to 5%wt of a biopolymer thickening agent which is not denatured or hydrolysed between<br>
10 pH 2 and 4, the edible composition having a gastric viscosity<br>
at 0.1 s-1  and 37Â°C of at least 20 Pa.s and wherein the gastric<br>
viscosity is greater than the viscosity of the composition.<br>
Depending upon the type of food product, it is further <br>
15 	preferred that the edible composition comprises a<br>
polysaccharide continuous phase, which continuous phase comprises at least a part of the biopolymer thickening agent/ preferably an amount of from 0.5 to 10% wt thereof based on the weight of the polysaccharide continuous phase. <br>
20<br>
It has been found that the presence of proteins in the edible compositions of the invention aids in the formation of the required viscosity according to the invention. Furthermore, the presence of both the protein and the biopolymer thickening <br>
25	agent is believed to have beneficial effects upon satiety, possibly, through changes to nutrient delivery in the small intestines.<br>
Preferably the biopolymer thickening comprises an ionic non-<br>
30 	starch polysaccharide, most preferably selected from alginates, pectins, carrageenans, amidated pectins, xanthans, gellans,<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
11<br>
furcellarans, karaya gum, rhamsan, welan, gum ghatti, gum arabic and salts or mixtures thereof. Alginates having a L-guluronic acid content of at least 60% are the most preferred ionic non-starch polysaccharides. <br>
5<br>
The biopolymer thickening may comprise a neutral non-starch polysaccharide, most especially galactamannan, guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, ispaghula, Î²-glucans, konjacglucomannan, methylcellulose, gum tragacanth, detarium, tamarind or mixtures<br>
10 thereof.<br>
Preferably the edible composition is a meal replacer or other food product intended to be used in a weight loss or weight control plan.<br>
15<br>
. The present invention provides an effective and convenient method of providing good satiety effects to food compositions, especially those intended to be used in a weight loss or weight control plan. Furthermore, the products can be manufactured by<br>
20 conventional techniques and are economical to produce. They are also stable upon storage.<br>
The advantages of the present invention include a good satiety effect after consumption of a food composition according to the<br>
25 invention; for example an enhanced feeling of satiety, feeling satiated sooner whilst eating and/or remaining satiated for a longer period of time after eating. These advantages are especially beneficial for the compliance with weight loss or weight control plans and/or the control or maintenance of body<br>
30 weight and/or body perception. There are also longer-term advantages associated with helping in the prevention of diseases related to being overweight.<br><br>

The term "meal replacer" or "meal replacement products" as used herein refer to products (compositions) which are intended to replace one or more conventional meals a day as part of a <br>
5 	weight loss or weight plan; they are of a controlled calorie content and are generally eaten as a single product or portion.<br>
The term "comprising" is not meant to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-<br>
10	specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive. Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above. <br>
15<br>
Spoonable edible compositions according to the invention typically display at 20Â°C the following characteristics:<br>
(a)	a yield value (also called: yield stress) of more than 50<br>
Pa extrapolated from shear rates between 100 and 300 s-1<br>
20     (Bingham)<br>
(b)	a Bingham viscosity of less than 500 mPa.s between shear<br>
rates of 100 and 300 s"1.<br>
Yield stress and Bingham viscosities may be determined <br>
25	utilising the Carrimed Rheometer. Measurements are performed at 5Â°C using 4Â°cone and plate geometry. The shear stress is increased from zero at a rate of 60 Pa/min and shear rates are measured until values in excess of 600 s"1 are achieved. The measurement is then terminated. A graph of shear stress vs. <br>
30 shear rate is plotted and a straight line fitted to the curve between the shear rates of 100 to 300 s"1. The slope of this line is the Bingham viscosity. The yield stress is determined by extrapolation of this line back to zero shear rate.<br><br>

Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, <br>
5 	physical properties of materials and/or use are to be<br>
understood as modified by the word "about." All amounts are by weight, based on the total weight of the relevant product, unless otherwise specified.<br>
10 Unless stated otherwise or required by context, the terms wfat" and "oil" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
A feeling of satiety as referred to herein means a greater or enhanced feeling of satiety (satiation) after eating and/or a<br>
15 longer lasting feeling of satiety after eating. Such effects typically reduce feelings of hunger and/or extend the time between food intake by an individual and can result in a smaller amount of food and/or fewer calories consumed in a single or subsequent sitting. The references herein to satiety<br>
20 include both what is strictly referred to as satiation and satiety, including end of meal satiety and between meals satiety. Satiety may also be perceived by an individual as a feeling of ^fullness', reduced hunger and/or reduced appetite.<br>
25 Detailed description of invention<br>
Gastric viscosity<br>
It has been found, according to the present invention that when<br>
edible compositions comprise a certain amount of protein and<br>
30 biopolymer thickening agents and have a certain gastric<br>
viscosity as hereindefined, advantageous satiety effects are<br>
obtained.<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
14<br>
The âgastric viscosity' value referred to herein is a measure of viscosity according to the method given hereinbelow and is used to simulate the viscosity of the ingested edible composition achieved in the stomach of the individual consuming <br>
5 	it. When the gastric viscosity as according to the present invention is achieved, the satiety effect of the edible compositions is enhanced.<br>
According to the present invention the edible compositions have<br>
10 a gastric viscosity as hereindefined at 0.1 s-1   and 37Â°C of at<br>
least 20 Pa.s, preferably of at least 25 Pa.s, most preferably of at least 30 Pa.s, such as of at least 35 Pa.s.<br>
The edible compositions preferably have a maximum gastric<br>
15 viscosity as hereindefined at 0.1 s-1and 37Â°C of 500 Pa.s,<br>
preferably of 400 Pa.s, most preferably of 300 Pa.s, especially of 200 Pa.s, such as 100 Pa.s. By "maximum" is meant that the gastric viscosity is no greater than this figure.<br>
20 The gastric viscosity as referred to herein is measured according to the following test procedure. The gastric viscosity is measured after 30 minutes.<br>
Gastric Viscosity test method; <br>
25 1.  325ml of the edible composition is placed in a beaker,<br>
maintained at 37Â°C and stirred using a suitable stirrer, e.g.        a magnetic stirrer. <br>
2.	The composition is acidified instantaneously to pH 4.8 using   1M hydrochloric acid. 10ml of the gastric juice <br>
30    	described in point 3 below is added to represent the conditions found in a fasting stomach.<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
15<br>
3.	A peristaltic pump is set up so as to deliver two<br>
solutions, each at a pre-set rate of 0.523ml/min over a<br>
period of about 30 minutes so that the pH of the edible<br>
composition is in the range of from 3.4 to 4.0 after 30<br>
5     minutes.<br>
-	Solution 1: A mixture of 1M hydrochloric acid and 500 kU Pepsin per litre (Sigma Product No P7012; Activity: 2,500-3,500 units per mg protein).<br>
-	Solution 2: An artificial gastric juice mixture<br>
10     consisting of the following salts {per litre); 0.22g CaCl2, 2.2g KC1, 5g NaCl, 1.5g NaHC03.<br>
4.	After the pH in point 2 is reached, 110ml of the edible<br>
composition is removed and the viscosity measured using a<br>
Physica UDS 200 rheometer having a measuring cup of 24.4 mm<br>
15    radius and a roughened concentric cylinder having a radius of 22.5 mm and a length of 67.5 mm and an apex (available from Physica MeÎ²technik GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). The roughened surface prevents slip occurring during testing to provide a more accurate measurement of viscosity. Viscosity<br>
20   is determined by incrementally increasing the shear stress<br>
over the range 0.1-100 Pa and maintaining the temperature at 37Â°C using a temperature-controlled water bath. Viscosity-shear rate flow curves are generated for samples over<br>
4     -3 -1 approximately seven decades of shear (~10 to 10 s )<br>
25   depending on properties of the edible composition. The<br>
viscosity at 0.1 s-1and 37Â°C is taken from these flow<br>
curves.<br>
The âviscosity of the composition' value referred to herein is 30 the viscosity of the composition measured according to the<br>
method in step 4. Thus the same rheological conditions are used<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
16<br>
but the composition is not subjected to the acidification step that is used to determine the gastric viscosity of the product.<br>
Typically a meal replacement beverage has a viscosity before <br>
5 consumption (i.e. âviscosity of the composition') in the range<br>
of from 0.005 to 0.5 at 0.1 s-1 and 37Â°C.<br>
The edible compositions of the invention are liquid or spoonable compositions which when consumed thicken in the <br>
10 stomach due to the acidic pH therein.<br>
According to the present invention, the gastric viscosity of the edible composition is greater than viscosity of the composition. This means that the composition increases in <br>
15 	viscosity at 0.1 s-1 at 37Â°C when undergoing acidification as would occur in the stomach upon consumption of the composition. This increase in viscosity to within the limits according to the present invention has been found to give good satiety benefits.<br>

10 	are divalent metal ion salts which are substantially water insoluble, for example tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate.<br>
The non-solubilised divalent metal ion source may be present in 15 the edible composition through the addition of another<br>
ingredient therein, for example, through the addition of a milk source wherein colloidal calcium phosphate will be present.<br>
The divalent metal ion source may be rendered non-solubilised 20 by virtue of being encapsulated so that it does not<br>

Examples<br>
20<br>
Example 1<br>
TM<br>
1.75% Protanal LF5/60  (alginate with an L-guluronic acid<br>
content of 69 % and a weight average molecular weight of 1.0-<br>
25 	1.2 x 105, available from FMC Biopolymer) was added to a<br>
commercially available meal replacement beverage (US Slim*Fastâ¢ Chocolate Royale Ready-to-drink beverage, purchased in cans from the same batch) by the method given below, such that 325ml of the beverage contained 5.69g of the alginate. The meal<br>
30 	replacement beverage comprised about 6.6g of protein.<br>
The cans were shaken, opened and weighed and brought over in a Wolff food processor.  The alginate, lactulose (5g, added for<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
35<br>
intestinal transit time calculation) and tricalcium phosphate (10% wt based on the weight of alginate) were blended and mixed in at a speed of 1500 rpm for 2 minutes at ambient temperature. The mixture was then vacuumed and mixed for a further 5<br>
5 	minutes. The Wolff jacket was heated with steam until the<br>
content was at 60Â°C and mixed at this temperature for <br>
15	 minutes at 1500 rpm.  The mixture was then poured in a UHT plant premix tank and slowly stirred during further processing. UHT processing was carried out by heating to 78-85Â°C, sterilisation 10 at 140Â°C for 9 seconds and cooling to 9Â°C  in two steps without a homogenisation step.  The drink was then filled in aseptic transparent bags containing approximately 1.0-1.5 kg. The sample bags were then stored at 5-7Â°C until use.<br>
15 The gastric viscosity of the edible composition was determined according to the gastric viscosity test defined above in the<br>
detailed description. The gastric viscosity at 0.1 s-1and 37Â°C was 40 Pa.s. The gastric viscosity was greater than the viscosity of the edible composition.<br>
20<br>
The Protanal was determined to be present in the polysaccharide continuous phase of the composition by Confocal Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy. The amount of Protanal in the polysaccharide continuous phase was estimated by Confocal<br>
25 Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM) using suitable image analysis software, as is readily available, to be about 4.05%wt, based on the weight of the polysaccharide continuous phase.<br>
The satiety effect of the edible composition was tested upon 25 30 human volunteers using the following test conditions. The<br>
volunteers entered the study centre at 11.30am, after consuming a standard breakfast at their own home. The edible composition<br><br>
WO 2005/020718<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009287<br><br>
36<br>
was consumed at 12:00 and satiety was determined before consumption and for five hours following consumption of the test meal. A VARS (Visual Analogue Rating Scale) questionnaire was used in order to determine a number of satiety parameters <br>
5 	(fullness, hunger, appetite).<br>
A control test meal was also consumed by the same volunteers on a different day. The control test meal was the same commercially available meal replacement beverage but without <br>
10 	the added alginate and tricalcium phosphate.<br>

TM<br>
1.0% Manugel DMB  (alginate with an L-guluronic acid content of<br>
72 % and a weight average molecular weight of 2.83 x 105, available from ISP/Kelco) was added to the control forumulation, by the method given below, such that 325ml of the<br>
15 composition contained 3.25g of the alginate. This provided a composition according to the invention.  The SMP provided the non-soluble divalent metal source (which was a mixture of different salts naturally occurring in SMP) at a level of 8.32%wt based on the weight of the alginate.<br>
20<br>
The control composition was stirred using a magnetic stirrer<br>
TM <br>
and the Manugel DMB  alginate was sprinkled into the solution<br>
at room temperature. The composition was then heated to 80Â°C for 10 minutes, the temperature then reduced to 37Â°C and maintained<br>
25 for 2 hours with continued stirring.<br>
The control composition comprised about 7.9g of protein.<br>
The gastric viscosity of the composition comprising the <br>
30 	alginate was determined according to gastric viscosity test defined above in the detailed description.  The gastric<br><br>

viscosity at 0.1 s-1and 37 C was 600 Pa.s which was greater than the viscosity of the edible composition.<br>
Addition of the Manugel DMBâ¢ alginate to the edible control <br>
5 	composition produced a polysaccharide continuous system determined by Confocal Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy.<br>
The satiety effect of the edible composition was tested upon 12 human volunteers using the following test conditions. The<br>
10 volunteers fasted overnight, abstained from alcohol for the previous 24 hours and caffeine and strenuous exercise for the previous 18 hours. The test meals were randomised according to the Latin Squares procedure. A satiety questionnaire was carried out before ingestion of the meals and 4 hours after<br>
15 ingestion. 500ml of water was consumed 2 hours after ingestion of the test meals. The results were statistically significant for a number of satiety scores (hunger, fullness, appetite) at a number of time points (see figures).<br>
