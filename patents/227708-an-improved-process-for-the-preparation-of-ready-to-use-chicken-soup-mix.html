				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved chicken soup mix composition and a<br>
process for preparing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Poultry industry is one of the important food industries in India, providing eggs<br>
and chicken meat to the consumers in Indian market. It occupies fourth place in<br>
the world in egg production, producing around 36,000 million eggs annually from<br>
layer chicken. Layer chicken population is around 140 million. Meat from layer<br>
chicken after egg laying period is completed is tough and under-utilized. Value<br>
addition and effective utility of this meat can be enhanced by processing the meat<br>
into ready-to-use convenient products such as chicken soup mixes. These types of<br>
products are becoming more popular in India and abroad in the consumer market.<br>
Globalization of Indian industry has further opened global markets for the<br>
chicken-based products. Hence, there is a growing demand for products like<br>
chicken soup mix (dehydrated) world over. To meet these demands, effective<br>
utilization of under-utilized layer chicken would not only provide value added<br>
products but also supply protein-rich nutrients to the consumers. Further, soup<br>
would stimulate the appetite and flow of digestive juices in stomach and normally<br>
they are consumed before meal. There is a limited information on the preparation<br>
of chicken soup mix in dehydrated form chicken meat. The objective is to develop<br>
an improved process for the preparation of chicken soup mix in dehydrated form<br>
from layer chicken meat.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference may be made to patent number GB 2007489 dated 23rd May 1979 by<br>
Toyo Suisan Kaisha (Instantly cookable dry soup mix) wherein an instantly<br>
cookable dry soup mix was prepared from a mixture of powdered dried stock<br>
which contained several dried ingredients. The main drawback is that the<br>
preparation involved only mixing of dry ingredients, which will give poor body to<br>
the prepared soup due to lack of binding between starch and meat solids .<br>
Reference may be made to patent number CN 1107670 dated 6th September, 1995<br>
by Botao Liu, C.N. and Yumin Yong C.N. (processing method for convenient beef<br>
or mutton soup blend and its soaked, steamed bread (paomao)) wherein the instant<br>
beef or mutton soup blend was made up through such steps as boiling fresh beef or<br>
mutton to half-cooked, slicing, boiling, flavoring in the beef or mutton soup<br>
concentration mixing with starch, white sugar, plant oil, buffer and refined edible<br>
salt. The main drawback is that the extract from beef or mutton instead of whole<br>
meat was used for making soup mix and the process involved concentration,<br>
which is a high energy consuming process.<br>
Reference may be made to patent number CN1293013 dated 2nd May 2001 by Li<br>
Deping, CN., Zhang Anhui, CN and Yang Yuiki (canned chicken soup) wherein a<br>
canned chicken soup was prepared from killed and cleaned fresh hen chicken,<br>
water, Chinese medical stone, refined, salt, flavoring etc. through steaming and<br>
canning the soup. The main drawbacks are that the product is not in dehydrated<br>
form and use of canning which is an expensive technology.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent number JP2002045154 dated 12th<br>
February 2002 by Hayashi Hiroyuki (chicken soup stock and method for<br>
producing the same) wherein chicken soup mix was prepared by adding water to<br>
the chicken meat, heating the mixture, keeping the mixture at a temperature not<br>
boiling water to condense the mixture, filtering the condensed chicken extract, and<br>
then condensing the obtained filtrate by the use of a vacuum condensation<br>
machine. The main drawback is that chicken extract was used for making soup and<br>
the process involved energy consuming vacuum condensation technique.<br>
Reference may be made to patent number US 5232732 by Harris NE and Davis<br>
BA dated August 3, 1993 (Dry soup mix), wherein in dry soup mix is prepared by<br>
mixing dry edible components such as starch, dried chicken solids, hydrolysed<br>
chicken protein and spice powders. The main drawbacks are the process involved<br>
use of hydrolysed chicken protein and mere mixing of dry ingredients will results<br>
in poor body of the prepared soup due to improper binding between starch and<br>
meat solids.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved chicken<br>
soup mix and a process for the preparation of the chicken soup mix composition<br>
which obviate the drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Another objective is to develop chicken soup mix in dehydrated form.<br>
Yet another objective is to improve the body of the prepared chicken soup.<br>
Yet another objective is to develop chicken soup mix rich in protein<br>
