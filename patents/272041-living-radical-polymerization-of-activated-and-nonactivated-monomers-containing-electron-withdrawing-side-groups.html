				<td>LIVING RADICAL POLYMERIZATION OF ACTIVATED AND NONACTIVATED<br>
MONOMERS CONTAINING ELECTRON-WITHDRAWING SIDE GROUPS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit to U.S. Patent Application No. 60/835,580 filed<br>
August 4,2006, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The invention concerns polymerization of alkenes such as acrylates,<br>
acrylamides, styrenes and other vinyl containing aromatic groups, methacrylates, vinyl halides,<br>
halogenated acrylates, vinyl aldehydes, halogenated olefins and any other activated and<br>
nonactivated monomers containing electron withdrawing substituents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Conventional metal-catalyzed organic radical reactions and living radical<br>
polymerizations (LRP) performed in nonpolar solvents, including atom-transfer radical<br>
polymerization (ATRP), proceed by an inner-sphere electron-transfer mechanism that require<br>
high activation energies. There is a need in the art for processes that can be performed at lower<br>
activation energies and, thus, lower temperatures.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] In some embodiments, the invention concerns a method of polymerizing an<br>
alkene monomer to produce a polymer, the method comprising contacting said monomer with:<br>
a catalyst that is Cu(0), Cu2Te, CuSe, Cu2S, Cu2O, or a combination thereof;<br>
an initiator that is one or more of sulfonyl halides, nitrogen halides or compounds of the<br>
formula R-X, R'C(=O)OR" or R'-CN, where X is a halogen and R is C1-C6 alky, R' is a<br>
halogen-substituted C1-C6 alkyl, and R" is a C1-C6 alkyl; and<br>
a component comprising a solvent and optional nitrogen-containing ligand, where the<br>
combination of the component and monomer is capable of diproportionating Cu(I)X into Cu(0)<br>
and Cu(n)X'2 where X' is Cl, Br, or I. It should be understood that any combination of<br>
monomer, solvent and optional ligand that diproportionates Cu(I)X into Cu(0) and Cu(II)X2 will<br>
work in the methods of the instant invention.<br>
[0005] In some preferred embodiments, the polymerization occurs in the presence of a<br>
nitrogen-containing ligand.<br>
[0006] Some preferred solvents include water, alcohol, natural or synthetic polymeric<br>
alcohols, dipolar aprotic solvents, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, ionic liquid, or a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
[0007] While other ligands such as dendrimeric polyamides and polyamines are<br>
suitable for the instant methods, preferred nitrogen containing ligand include one or more of<br>
those of the formula:<br><br><br>
[0008] In some embodiments, the initiator is one or more of chloroform, bromoform,<br>
idoform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide, mono-, di- and trihalo-acetates and any other<br>
initiator that is suitable for the conventional metal catalyzed living radical polymerization<br>
including ATRP and compounds of the formula:<br><br>
[0009] Suitable alkene monomer include acrylates, halogenated acrylates,<br>
methylacrylates, halogen-substituted alkenes, acrylamides, methacrylamides, vinyl sulfones,<br>
vinyl ketones, vinyl sulfoxides, vinyl aldehydes, styrenes, and any other activated and<br>
nonactivated monomers containing electron withdrawing substituents.<br>
These monomers may be substituted. In some embodiments, the monomers optionally contain<br>
functional groups that assist in the disproportionation of Cu(I)X into Cu(0) and Cu(II)X2,<br>
Functional groups include amide, sulfoxide, carbonate, or onium.<br>
[0010] Halogen-substituted alkenes include vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl<br>
fluoride, vinylidene fluoride, trifhioroethylene, trifiuotochloroethylene or tetrafhioroethylene,<br>
hexafluoropropylene and fluorinated vinyl ethers.<br>
[0011] In some embodiments, the methods may be advantageously practiced at about<br>
35°C or below, 25°C or below, or 20°C or below. In other embodiments, the reaction can be<br>
carried out at any higher temperature with a lower amount of catalyst<br>
[0012] Suitable initiators include halogen containing compounds. Examples of<br>
initiators include chloroform, bromofonn, iodoform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide,<br><br>
hexahalogenated ethane ,mono-di and trihaloacetates, acetophenones, halogenated amides and<br>
polyamides such as nylons, halogenated urcthanes and polyurethane including their block<br>
copolymers such as Lycra®, halogenated imides, acetone, and any other initiators shown to work<br>
with conventional metal catalyzed living radical polymerization including ATRP and compounds<br>
of the formula:<br><br>
[0013] Any combination of solvent or mixture of solvent and ligand that<br>
disproportionate Cu(I)X into Cu(0) and Cu(II)X2 are suitable for use in the instant methods. In<br>
some embodiments, the solvent can be used also in only small amount since it can provide a<br>
catalytic effect. See, for example, Figure 3. Thus, the solvent can act, not only as a solvent, but<br>
as a catalyst for the reaction. Furthermore, additional solvents, which may or may not provide a<br>
catalytic effect, can optionally be used in the reaction.<br>
[0014] In certain embodiments, the solvent is a dipolar aprotic solvent. Preferred<br>
dipolar aprotic solvents include DMSO, DMAc, NMP, or DMF.<br>
[0015] The amount of catalyst used in the instant invention is from about 100% to<br>
about 0.01%, based on moles, of the initiator. At low levels of catalyst the polymer can be used<br>
without further purification to remove the catalyst residues.<br>
[0016] m some embodiments, the method further comprises isolating the polymer.<br>
Depending on the end use requirements and me amount of catalyst residue in the polymer, the<br>
polymer may be used without the need for further purification (when low levels of catalyst are<br>
used, for example).<br><br>
[0017] In certain embodiments, the polymer produced by the processes described<br>
herein have a number average molecular weight of at least 500. In yet other embodiments, the<br>
polymer has a number average molecular weight of at least 106.<br>
[0018] A telechelic polymer is a polymer carrying functionalized endgroups. Such<br>
polymers are within the scope of the instant methods. Telechelic polymers can be used, for<br>
example in the synthesis of block co-polymers. In some embodiments, the polymers of the<br>
instant invention are telechelic polymers containing active balides. These telechelic polymers<br>
can be used as initiators for the synthesis of block copolymers or can be subsequently<br>
functionalized at the halidc chain ends via conventional organic reactions to create other<br>
telechelic polymers. In some embodiments, the chain end concerns functionalization of a halide.<br>
Such polymers can be reacted by conventional means to produce a block copolymer.<br>
[0019] In some embodiments, the polymers can be functionalized by other useful<br>
moieties. For example, the moiety may be a drug or pharmaceutical composition, such as FDA<br>
approved pharmaceuticals, are useful moieties.<br>
[0020] Pharmaceuticals can also be incorporated by polymerization of drug carrying<br>
monomers and of reagents supported on monomers including monomelic solvents and FDA<br>
approved monomers.<br>
[0021] The invention also concerns synthesis of dendrimers and hyperbranched<br>
polymers. Dendrimer are molecules have a tree-like or generational structure. A high level of<br>
synthetic control is needed in the production of these compositions. This control is achieved by<br>
step-wise reactions which create the molecule one layer at a time. The core of the dendrimer is<br>
a multifunctional molecule and further multifunctional molecules are used to create additional<br>
branch sites. Dendrimer can be made by divergent synthesis and convergent synthesis methods.<br>
Divergent synthesis assembles the molecule from the core to the periphery. Convergent<br>
synthesis assembles the molecule from the outside to termination at the core.<br>
[0022] In one preferred embodiment, the invention concerns a method of polymerizing<br>
an alkene monomer to produce a polymer having a number average molecular weight of at least<br>
106, the method comprising contacting said monomer with:<br>
Cu(0), Cu2Te, CuSe, Cu2S, Cu2O, or a combination thereof;<br>
a nitrogen-containing ligand;<br>
an initiator that is one or more of sulfonyl halides, nitrogen halides or compounds of the<br>
formula R-X, R'C(=O)OR' or R'-CN, where X is a halogen and R is C1-C6 alky, R' is a<br>
halogen-substituted C1-C6 alkyl, and R" is a C1-C6 alkyk and<br><br>
a solvent that is water, any alcohol or compound containing more than one OH groups<br>
including polysaccharides polymers and monomers, dipolar aprotic solvent, ethylene carbonate,<br>
propylene carbonate, or a mixture thereof,<br>
wherein the solvent and nitrogen-containing ligand are capable of diproportionating<br>
Cu(I)X into Cu(0) and Cu(II)X2 where X is F, Cl, Br or I where the diproportionation has an<br>
equilibrium constant of at least 10s favoring the Cu(0) and Cu(II)X2 species.<br>
[0023] The invention also concerns the products made by the processes described<br>
herein.<br>

initiators include chloroform, bromoform, idoform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide<br>
and compounds of the formula:<br><br>
In some preferred embodiments, the initiator is an alkyl, sulfonyl, or nitrogen halide. The<br>
nitrogen halide can be also a halogenated nylon, peptide or protein. Alternatively a polymer<br>
containing active halide groups such as the structural defects of polyvinyl chloride), the<br>
chloromethyl group of poly(chloromethyl styrene) of other polymers and copolymers can also<br>
be used as initiators.<br>
[0042] Initiators shown to work in conventional metal catalyzed living metal<br>
polymerizations will also work with the instant methods. Such compositions are well known by<br>
those skilled in the art. See, for example, Percee, V.; Popov, A. V.; Ramirez-Castillo, E.;<br>

[0043] In some embodiments, when the term "halide" is used herein, preferred halides<br>
include Cl, Br, F, or I.<br>
[0044] Metal-catalyzed living radical polymerization (LRP) initiated with alkyl<br>
sulfonyL and N-halides has been accomplished in organic and aqueous media as well as in ionic<br>
liquids, mostly for activated monomers such as styrene, acrylates, methacrylates, and<br>
acryionitrile. Polymers with complex architecture, such as dendritic macromolecules, have also<br>
been synthesized by metal catalyzed LRP (Percec, V.; Barboiu, B.; Grigoras, C; Bera, T.K. J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125,6503-6516.).<br>
[0045] Metal-catalyzed LRP is considered to proceed via an inner-sphere redox process<br>
in which a low oxidation state metal complex acts as a catalyst, mediating a fast exchange<br>
between radicals and their dormant alkyl halide species. The equilibrium between active and<br>
dormant species is shifted toward the dormant species via an excess of high oxidation state<br>
catalyst generated by a small extent of bimolecular radical dimerization during the initial stages<br>
of the polymerization. This concept is known as internal suppression of fast reactions or<br>
persisten radical effect (PRE). The inner-sphere radical process is called atom-transfer-radical-<br>
addition (ATRA). The corresponding radical polymerization was therefore, named atom-<br>
transfer-radical-polymerization (ATRP). Non-activated monomers that generate stable alkyl<br>
halide dormant species such as vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, and ethylene do not and are not<br>
expected to polymerize by the current generation of ATRP catalysts. Of specific interest is vinyl<br>
chloride (VC) because it cannot be polymerized via any living mechanism. Recently, the metal-<br>
catalyzed LRP of VC initiated by CHI3 and mediated via a competition between outer-sphere<br>
single-electron-transfer (SET) and degenerative chain transfer (DT) mechanisms (SET-DTLRP)<br>
was reported.<br>
[0046] The polymerization processes of the present invention proceed at 25 °C in H2O<br>
and uses as catalyst Cu(0) and/or "nascent" Cu(0) generated in situ via the disproportionation of<br>
various Cu(I) precursors. In this polymerization, Cu(0) species act as electron-donors, and the<br>
initiator and dormant propagating species as electron-acceptors. The Cu(I) species generated<br>
during the formation of radicals disproportionate spontaneously into extremely reactive nascent<br>
Cu(II) and Cu(0) species that mediate the initiation and the reversible termination. This<br>
disproportionation generates, via a self-regulated mechanism, in situ, the Cu(II) species that, in<br>
the case of VC, would not be accessible via a conventional PRE mechanism since the radical<br>
polymerization of VC is dominated by chain transfer to monomer rather than bimolecular<br>
termination. By this mechanism, the inactive Cu(I) species are spontaneously consumed and the<br>
catalytically active Cu(0) species are continuously produced. Here we report that, under suitable<br><br>
conditions, the DT part of the SET-DTLRP can be eliminated and the newly elaborated LRP<br>
becomes SET-LRP. This polymerization process takes place in H2O, protic, dipolar aptotic, and<br>
other polar solvents that in presence of N-ligand were discovered to disproportionate Cu(I) into<br>
Cu(0) and Cu(II), and in addition, favor a SET process. SET-LRP occurs under very mild<br>
reaction conditions, at room temperature and below, uses a catalytic rather than a stoichiometric<br>
amount of catalyst, and although proceeds ultrafast, generates polymers with unprecedenuy high<br>
molecular weight. SET-LRP is general and applies to both nonactivated and activated monomers<br>
containing electron-withdrawing groups, such as vinyl chloride and other halogenated<br>
monomers, acrylates, and methacrytates. It also applies to organic reactions and tolerates a<br>
diversity of functional groups.<br>
Selecting Catalysts.<br>
[0047] A schematic mechanism for SET-LRP is shown in Scheme 1.<br><br>
[0048] The initiation (activation) step (kact) is mediated by a SET from the electron-<br>
donor (Cu(0) or other species) to the electron-acceptor (alkyl halide, sulfonyl halide, or N-halide<br>
initiator). Subsequently, the Cu(I) generated in this step disproportionates instantaneously into<br>
Cu(II) and Cu(0) species. The disproportionation of Cu(I) in H2O can proceed in the presence of<br>
chelating compounds with an equilibrium constant of 106. Cu(I) disproportionates spontaneously<br>
in H2O in the presence of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) and poly(etnylene imine) (PEI). The<br>
very reactive "nascent" Cu(II) species generated from the disproportionation reaction provide the<br>
reversible deactivation (kdeacr) of the radicals into dormant alkyl halide species. Cu(0) promotes<br><br>
the reactivation of the dormant species. Both processes occur via a SET mechanism. In order to<br>
assess the electron-donating character of Cu(0) and other Cu(I) species, their EHOMO were<br>
calculated. Table 1 reports the EHOMO in electron volts (ev) for Cu(0), CuCl, CuBr, CuL Cu20,<br>
Cu2S, Cu2Se, and Cu2Te. Cu(0) is known to be an efficient single-electron-donor agent. In<br>
addition, Cu20, Cu2S, Cu2Se, and Cu2Te have been investigated since they were developed in<br>
our laboratory as the most efficient self-regulated catalysts for LRP initiated with sulfonyl<br>
halides and N-halides in nonpolar, and polar solvents, in ionic liquids, and for SET-DTLRP of<br>
VC in H2O. Their mechanism of catalysis is, however, not known for any of the previously<br>
reported LRP reactions. CuCl, CuBr, and CuI were studied because, in the reaction mechanism<br>
outlined in Scheme 1, depending on the structure of the initiator, they are believed to be<br>
transient, inactive species. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
[00491 The most efficient electron-donor SET catalysts are Cu2Te followed by Cu2Se,<br>
Cu(0), Cu2S and Cu2O. CuI, CuBr, and specifically CuCl are very poor electron donors although<br>
they are catalysts of choice for ATRA and ATRP. Since the lifetime of Cu(I)X is very short in<br>
comparison with that of Cu(0) and Cu(II)X2 species, during reaction conditions that favor<br>
disproportionation of Cu(I) into Cu(II) and Cu(0), the SET catalytic activity of Cu(I)X halides<br>
can be neglected. Therefore, Cu2Te, Cu2Se, Cu(0), Cu2S, and Cu2O are expected to provide the<br>
best catalysts for the SET-LRP.<br><br>
Selecting Llgands and Solvents.<br>
[0050] A UV spectroscopy study was performed to assess the activity of various<br>
solvents, in addition to H2O, and ligands for the dispropoitionation of Cu(I) into Cu(II) and<br>
Cu(0). Representative examples of UV experiments are shown in Figure 1.<br>
[0051] Deaerated solutions containing solvent, ligand, and Cu(I)X or Cu(II)X2 were<br>
prepared and their UV spectra were recorded immediately. The Cu(II)X2 solution was used as a<br>
standard to assess the dispropoitionation of Cu(I)X. Figure 1a shows that, in the absence of a<br>
ligand, CuBr does not disproportionate in DMSO. However, complete and instantaneous<br>
disproportionation of CuBr into CuBr2 and Cu(0) occurs in the presence of tris(2-<br>
dimethylaminoethyl)arnine (Me6-TREN) in DMSO (Figure lb). When Me6-TREN was replaced<br>
with 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), disproportionation of CuCl was also observed in DMSO, but it was<br>
not as fast as in the presence of Me6-TREN in DMSO (Figure 1c). However, N-n-propyl-2-<br>
pyridyl-methanimine in DMSO does not disproportionate CuBr (Figure 1d). Me6TREN, TREN,<br>
PEL bpy, N,N,N',N",N"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA), and many other N-ligands<br>
that bind Cu(II) species disproportionate Cu(I)X into Cu(B)X2 and Cu(0) not only in H2O, but<br>
also in protic solvents (MeOH, EtOH, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 2-<br>
(2ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, tetraethylene glycol, glycerine, phenol), dipolar aprotic solvents<br>
(DMSO, DMF, DMAc, NMP, etc.), ionic liquids and ethylene carbonate, but not in CH3CN.<br>
Therefore, any combination of catalyst, ligand, and solvent that was discovered here to favor<br>
disproportionation of Cu0) into Cu(0) and Cu(H) is expected to be efficient in mediating SET-<br>
LRP.<br>
Selecting Initiators.<br>
[0052] The inner-sphere atom transfer mechanism is known to show a strong<br>
dependence of the metal catalyzed kact, on the nature of the halogen from the structure of R-X. In<br>
two independent series of experiments the ratio, kact, (R-Br)/kact, (R-Cl) was in the range of 103 to<br>
9x 104. However, in the case of the outer-sphere mechanism, kact has a much smaller dependence<br>
on the nature of the halogen from R-X. For example the ratio, k.acr (R-I)/kact (R-Br) ~ kact (R-<br>
Br)/kact, (R-Cl) ~ 1 to 10. Based on these data, it is expected that the range of initiators available<br>
for the case of metal mediated SETLRP must be much broader man that for the case of metal<br>
mediated inner-sphere process. Alkyl halides, sulfonyl halides, and N-halides containing Cl, Br,<br>
and I as the halide must be efficient in the case of SETLRP. In the case of metal-catalyzed inner-<br>
sphere ATRP iodine-containing initiators undergo a competition between inner-sphere and<br>
degenerative transfer.<br><br>
SET-LRP of Acrylates Initiated with Methyl-2-Bromopropionate (MBP) and 2-<br>
bramopropionitrile (BPN) and Catalyzed with Cu(0)/Me6-TREN in DMSO.<br>
[00531 Cu(0)/bpy catalyzed LRP of methacrylates initiated with sulfonyl halides in<br>
nonpolar solvents at high temperatures was reported from our laboratory and was shown to be<br>
accelerated by many additives including ethylene glycol. Mixtures of Cu(0)/Cu(II)X2 or even<br>
Cu(0) alone were used to catalyze the LRP initiated with alkyl halides at high temperature in<br>
bulk and in nonpolar solvents. It was concluded that Cu(0) increases the rate of reaction since it<br>
reduces Cu(II)X2 to Cu(I)X, the latter being considered the catalyst Cu(0) alone was shown to<br>
provide poor control of molecular weight and molecular weight distribution since the Cu(I)X<br>
species generated cannot react with radicals to produce the dormant alkyl halides.<br>
[0054] Figure 2 shows examples of LRP of methyl acrylate (MA) catalyzed by<br>
MBP/Cu(0)/Me6-TREN carried out at 25 °C in DMSO. Complete conversions are obtained in<br>
less than 50 min for [MBP]0/[Cu(0)]0 = 1/1 (mole/mole) (Figure 2a, b). The reaction time is<br>
similar when [MBP]0/[Cu(0)]0 — 1/0.1 (mole/mole) (Figure 1c, d) and even when some excess of<br>
CuBr2 is added (Figure 2e, f). In all cases, kinetic plots show internal first order of reaction in<br>
monomer and growing species, and the resulting poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) has low molecular<br>
weight distribution. The amount of catalyst used is decreased from 100% versus initiator to<br>
10% and even to 1%. Below 10% catalyst the reaction mixture is colorless.<br>
[0055] Kinetic experiments, used according to the procedure reported previously,<br>
provided the external orders of reaction of the polymerization in [Cu(0)], [DMSO], and [CuBr2]<br>
(Figure 3). As expected for the mechanism illustrated in Scheme 1, a complex, less than one,<br>
order of reaction in [Cu(0)] is observed. The orders of reaction in [DMSO] and [CuBr2] are<br>
about one. This demonstrates the expected catalytic effect of DMSO in mis reaction and the<br>
capability of performing the LRP in the presence of a high concentration of CuBr2 at a<br>
reasonable high rate. These data provide instructions on how to control the rate of<br>
polymerization. For example, the amount of DMSO used in these experiments can be less than<br>
the amount of monomer and therefore, the reaction mixture can only be diluted with solvent.<br>
Under these conditions only small amount of DMSO is required to mediate this polymerization.<br><br>
Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight PMA by Cu(0)/Me6-TREN Catalyzed LRP<br>
Initiated with MBP.<br>
[0056] The simplest test of the efficiency of a living polymerization is to assess its<br>
ability to synthesize polymers with ultrahigh molecular weight i. e., with number average<br>
molecular weight (Mn) larger than 106. Previously the highest molecular weight linear polymers<br>
synthesized by LRP metal-catalyzed technique were Mn = 300,000 for poly(n-<br>
butylmethacrylate), Mn =367,000 for polymethylmethacrylate), Mn = 554,000 for<br>
poly(methylacrylate), and Mn-823,000 for poly(tertbutylacrylate).<br>
[0057] Figure 4 shows representative examples of kinetic experiments in which<br>
[MA]0/[MBP]0 = 11,000 (Figure 4a, b, c, d) and 22,200 (Figure 4 e, f). PMA with Mn = 690,000<br>
(Mw/Mn = 1.10), 950,000 (Mw/Mn = 1.12), and respectively 1,420,000 CMw/Mn = 1.15) and<br>
narrow molecular weight distributions were obtained in 3 h, 6 h, and respectively 10 h. The<br>
much higher molecular weight polymers obtained by SET-LRP suggests much less termination<br>
at much higher rate than in previous metal-catalyzed LRP performed in molar media. These are<br>
remarkable results considering that the reaction conditions used were not optimized. Radical<br>
polymerizations and LRP of acrylates are known to be accompanied by intramolecular chain<br>
transfer to polymer and therefore, to produce branched polyacrylates when the reaction is<br>
performed at high temperatures. The analysis of the HMQC and HMBC spectra of linear poly(n-<br>
butylacrylate) made at 25 °C revealed that branching in this sample is less than 1%. A linear<br>
PMA, free of branching, was obtained in the polymerization executed at 25 °C.<br>
CHCl3, CHBr3, and CHI3 as Bifunctional Initiators for the LRP of MA<br>
[0058] Catalyzed by Cu(0), Cu2Te, CuzSe, Cu2S, Cu2O/Me6-TREN in DMSO. The<br>
simplest difunctional initiators for the synthesis of α,ω-difunctional telechetic polyacrylates are<br>
CHCl3, CHBr3, and CHI3. Figure 5 shows kinetic experiments for all initiators and Cu(0)/Me6-<br>
TREN catalyst. Only CHCl3 requires a small amount of CuCl2 additive to control the LRP. The<br>
most important message provided by this figure is that regardless of the structure of the<br>
haloform, the apparent rate constant of propagation (kp) does not depend strongly on the<br>
structure of the halogen. Although this is a complex rate constant, its trend resembles mat<br>
observed in other SET mediated processes and differs from that seen in ATRA and ATRP.<br><br>
Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight PMA by Cu(0)/Me6-TREN Catalyzed LRP<br>
Initiated with Haloforms.<br>
[0059] The bifunctional initiators CHBr3 and CHCl3 were used to demonstrate the<br>
synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight PMA (Figure 6). The bifunctional haloform initiators<br>
CHBr3 and CHCl3 were also tested for the synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight linear PMA.<br>
The results of selected kinetic experiments using these initiators are presented in the Figure 6.<br>
[0060] PMMA with Mn up to 1,400,000 and narrow molecular weight distribution are<br>
easily accessible in reasonable reaction time. CHCl3 initiator gives the best results when a small<br>
amount of CuCl2 additive was used to regulate the polymerization. The nature of the haloform<br>
does not change significantly the kinetic parameters (including kpapp) of these polymerizations<br>
under similar reaction conditions. This observation was also valid (wide supra) when various<br>
haloforms were employed for the synthesis of low molecular weight PMA (Figure S). The use of<br>
these easily available and inexpensive solvents as bifunctional initiators for the synthesis of<br>
ultrahigh molecular weight PMA might be attractive from industrial point of view and for the<br>
synthesis of ABA block copolymers that are not accessible with monofunctional initiators such<br>
as MBP.<br>
Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight 8- and 4-Arm Star PMA.<br>
[0061 ] The Cu(0) based catalytic system was also utilized for the synthesis of 4- and 8-<br>
arm star PMA. The bromopropionate based 4armed (4BrPr derived from pentaerithritol) and 8-<br>
armed (8BrPr derived from 4-tert-butyl calyx[8]arene) initiators were used in these experiments.<br>
Representative kinetic plots of LRP of MA initiated with 4BrPr and 8BrPr star shape initiators<br>
are shown in the Figure 7.<br>
[0062] In all experiments, the monomer conversion reaches up to 90%. The plots of<br>
ln[MA]0/[MA] as a function of time and that of experimental versus theoretical Mn increase<br>
linearly. The Mw/Mn values remain very low throughout the polymerization. These results<br>
indicate the living nature of these polymerizations and the absence of star-star coupling as well<br>
as other side reactions. It is remarkable that both 4- and 8- arm star PMA with Mn up to<br>
1,000,000 can be obtained in a living manner at room temperature in a relatively short time. The<br>
decreased catalyst concentration (Figure 7a and 7b) as well as the use of a small amount of<br>
CuBr2 as additive (Figure 7c and 7d) provides an excellent control over polymerization yielding<br>
high molecular weight 4- and 8-arm PMA with low molecular weight distribution. Reports on<br>
the synthesis of multi arm star polyacrylates and polymetacrylates using the same 4BrPrRef and<br>
8BrPrRef and other multifunctional initiators under inner-sphere metal-catalyzed conditions are<br><br>
available. All previous synthetic procedures required high polymerization temperatures, long<br>
reaction times and were performed in nonpolar solvents.<br>
LRP of MA Initiated with Haloforms and Catalyzed by Cu(0), Cu2O, Cu2S, Cu2Se,<br>
Cu2Te/TREN in DMSO.<br>
[0063] The simplest and the least expensive ligands that can be used in this LRP are TREN and<br>
PEL They were previously used in the LRP of VC in H2O together with the same catalysts.<br>
Figure 8 provides several examples of kinetics that demonstrate the very fast synthesis of<br>
different medium molecular weight (Figure 8 a, b) and very high molecular weight PMA (Figure<br>
8 b, c). This polymerization can be carried out in the presence or absence of CuX2 (Figure 8).<br>
Catalysis by Cu2O, Cu2S, Cu2Se, and Cu2Te/TREN in DMSO was demonstrated by the kinetic<br>
experiments. The resulting PMA contains two functional chain ends with different reactivity.<br>
This suggests new strategies for the synthesis of multifunctional block copolymers and other<br>
complex architectures.<br>
LRP of MMA Initiated with 2,2-Dichloroacetophenone (DCAP) and Phenoxybenzene-4,4'-<br>
Disulfonylchloride (PDSC) Catalyzed by Cu(0)/PMDETA and bpy in Dipolar Aprotic<br>
Solvents.<br>
[0064] Two examples of unoptimized kinetic experiments are presented in Figure 9.<br>
The first one is initiated with DCAP and catalyzed by Cu(0)/PMDETA in Supporting Scheme<br>
SS2) and catalyzed with Cu(0)/bpy in NMP. Both experiments were performed at 25 °C. Since<br>
sulfonyl halides are known to undergo side reactions in the presence of DMSO and of aliphatic<br>
N-containing ligands, the classic bpy ligand employed previously with sulfonyl halide initiators<br>
was used. These two examples demonstrate a dramatic acceleration by comparison with related<br>
experiments carried out in nonpolar solvents.<br>
LRP of VC Initiated with CHBr3 and Catalyzed with Cu(0), Cu2O, Cu2S, Cu2Se,<br>
Cu2Te/TREN in DMSO.<br>
[0065] Previously, we have reported the SET-DT-LRP of VC initiated with CHI3 in<br>
H2O at 25 °C catalyzed by the same catalytic systems. However, since CHI3 is a good chain<br>
transfer agent and the polymerization mixture was heterogeneous, a two stage kinetic process<br>
leading to a limited VC conversion was observed. In addition, CHBr3 would be a less reactive,<br>
more stable and less expensive initiator for the polymerization of VC. Since reactivity studies on<br>
MA have demonstrated little difference between the nature of X from the structure of R-X and its<br><br>
kact, we decided to investigate reaction conditions for the polymerization of VC initiated with<br>
CHBr3. Using Me6-TREN as a ligand in conjunction with Cu(0) mediates the polymerization of<br>
VC only to low conversion. However, the replacement of Me6-TREN with TREN in DMSO<br>
provided a rewarding result. Figure 10 presents selected experiments catalyzed with different<br>
concentrations of Cu(0)/TREN and DMSO.<br>
[0066] Without optimization, we can see that about 90% VC conversion can be reached<br>
in a very short period of time. The molar ratio [CHBr3]0/[Cu(0)]0 can be reduced from 1/1<br>
(Figure 10 a, b) to 1/0.5 (Figure 10 c, d) and to 1/0.1 (Figure 10 e, f) with higher rates than<br>
previously reported with CHI3. Since the amount of DMSO used in these polymerizations is very<br>
small, at the end of the polymerization the reaction mixture contains the white solid PVC<br>
plasticized with some DMSO. Therefore, purification of PVC requires only washing with 1120<br>
or MeOH. The limited amount ofCu(0) powder required to mediate this polymerization suggests<br>
that Cu(0) wire is sufficient to promote it. Indeed, Figure 11 a,b demonstrates this concept<br>
(compare Figure 10 c,d with Figure 11 a,b). Higher molecular weight PVC can be obtained with<br>
higher [VC]0/[CHBr3]0 ratios in the presence of Cu(0), Cu2Te, Cu2Se, Cu2S, and Cu2O. The<br>
resulting α,ω-dibromo (PVC) can be used as initiator for the synthesis of blockcopolymers and<br>
other complex architectures.<br>
Mechanistic Considerations.<br>
[0067] The experimental observation that in situ formed Cu(I)X undergo spontaneous<br>
disproportionation under the polymerization conditions and that most of these polymerizations<br>
do not require externally added deactivator such Cu(II)X2 demonstrates that the active catalyst is<br>
the nascent Cu(0) molecular species (Scheme 1). When Cu2Te, Cu2Se, Cu2S and CuzO are used<br>
as catalysts they are the initial electron-donor catalysts. The rawer interesting question is: by<br>
what mechanism are the radicals formed under these conditions? Several experimental<br>
observations as well as literature data help to elaborate the most probable mechanistic hypothesis<br>
for the activation of the dormant species. On the one hand the kpapp during LRP of MA strongly<br>
depends on the concentration of DMSO used in the polymerization mixture (Figure 3b).<br>
Increasing DMSO concentration leads to faster polymerization while maintaining the good<br>
control over molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. If the radicals would be formed<br>
through an inner-sphere homo lytic atom-transfer process, like in the case of ATRA and ATRP<br>
than the polymerization rate and hence the kpapp would have to exhibit very little dependence on<br>
the polarity of the reaction medium. This is because the rate of reactions where radical<br>
intermediates are involved is not strongly dependent on the polarity of the medium. In principle<br><br>
the opposite effect should be observed: polymerization rate must decrease when me monomer,<br>
catalyst and initiator concentration decrease. This observation is an indication that the formation<br>
of radicals is occurring via a different mechanism. One option is that ionic intermediates are<br>
involved in the rate-limiting step of the radical formation. In this case the rate of radical<br>
generation must dependent strongly on the polarity of the reaction medium and mis indeed was<br>
observed experimentally (Figure 3b). The radicals are most likely generated through the<br>
decomposition of radical-anion intermediates that are initially formed via the SET reaction<br>
between Cu(0) species and the halogen containing substrates such as initiator and halogen<br>
terminated polymeric chain end. These considerations are supported by literature data that show<br>
that dipolar aprotic as well as protic solvents facilitate fast SET reactions between electron-donor<br>
including Cu(0) and various halogen containing compounds (including haloforms and<br>
tetrahalomethanes).<br>
[0068] A series of Quantum Chemical calculations were also performed on model<br>
systems to verify which path best describes the experimental observations that the nature of the<br>
halogen does not affect the rate of polymerization of MA when Cu(0) catalyst is used under<br>
similar conditions. The results of these calculations are shown in Scheme 2.<br><br>
Scheme 2. Relative C-X bond dissociation energies in methyl 2-halopropionates:<br>
homolytic bond dissociation (top diagram) and formation and decomposition of anion-radicals<br>
formed by set process (bottom diagram) calculated using: (U)B3LYP/6-31+G*//(U)B3LYP/6-<br><br>
31+G* (for Cl and Br Case) or (U)B3LYP/LACVP+*// (U)B3LYP/LACVP+* (for I Case)<br>
methods.<br>
[0069] The homolytic C-X bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the initiators MCP (X =<br>
Cl), MBP (X = Br), and MIP (X = I) species appears to strongly depend on the nature of the<br>
halogen and usually increases in the following order Cl &gt; Br &gt; I (Scheme 2, top diagram). The<br>
calculated BDE are in good agreement with previously calculated values obtained for the same<br>
methyl 2- halopropionate systems. The C-X bond dissociation energy depends very little on the<br>
nature of the halogen (X) if it is occurring through the decomposition of me radical-anion formed<br>
via a SET process (Scheme 2, bottom diagram). The generalized catalytic cycle of SET-LRP is<br>
depicted in the Scheme 3.<br><br>
Scheme 3. Proposed catalytic cycle of SET-LRP mediated by Cu(0) species in polar<br>
media.<br>
[0070] The reaction starts with SET reaction between Cu(0) species and the halogen<br>
containing substrate (initiator on halogen terminated polymeric chain end). Any polar solvent<br>
including DMSO facilitates the decrease of interaction between anion (X-) and electrophilic<br>
radical (R) from the radical-anion pair. The radical anion cluster and Cu/L+ countercation must<br>
be in close proximity in the so called caged ion-pair thus further facilitating decomposition of<br>
radical-anion into the radical and the anion (X-). The reaction between radical and deactivator<br>
CuX2/Ligand in polar media is a more complex process. One of the possible mechanisms may<br>
involve the transfer of the halide anion X- from the deactivator to the propagating macroradical<br>
R', leading to a similar ion-cage composed of radical anion [R—X]- and CuX/L+<br>
countercation. The mechanism depicted in the Scheme 3 is simplified in a way to understand the<br>
main chemical events, which might be involved in this catalytic process. The goal of this report<br>
is not to provide a complete mechanistic investigation of the SET-LRP process mediated by<br>
nascent Cu(0) species, but rather to develop the SET-LRP synthetic method and to compare it<br><br>
with that based on the inner-sphere process. More experimental and theoretical studies are<br>
necessary to elucidate the hypothetic mechanism outlined in Scheme 3. Investigations in this<br>
direction are in progress and will be reported in due time.<br>
[0071] Nevertheless, the SET-LRP reported here, together with its mechanistic<br>
hypothesis, explains numerous literature examples in which an acceleration of the Cu(I)X-<br>
catalyzed LRP was observed in H2O, alcohols, ethylene glycol, DMSO, DMF, and ionic<br>
liquids.<br>

2. Techniques<br>
[0075] 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Broker DRX500 machine at 20<br>
°C in CDCl3 or THF-d8, with or without tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Gel<br>
permeation chromatographic (GPC) analyses of the polymer samples were done on a Perkin-<br>
Elmer Series 10 high performance liquid chromatograph, equipped with an LC-100 column oven<br>
(40 oC), a Nelson Analytical 900 Series integrator data station, a Perkin-Elmer 785A UV-VIS<br>
detector (254 nm), a Varian star 4090 refractive index (RI) detector and two AM gel (500 Å, 5<br>
µm and 104 Å, 5 µm for low molecular weight samples) or three AM gel (500 Å, 10 µm; 104 Å,<br>
5 µm; and 105 Å, 10 µm for high molecular weight samples) columns. THF (Fisher, HPLC<br>
grade) was used as eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The number (Mn) and weight average<br>
(Mw) molecular weights of the PMA and PMMA samples were determined with PMMA<br>
standards purchased from American Polymer Standards. The Mn and Mw of the PVC samples<br>
were determined with polystyrene (PS) standards purchased from American Polymer Standards<br>

3. UV Spectroscopic Analyses of Cu(I)X Disproportionation<br>
|0076] Typical UV-VIS Spectroscopic Analysis of CuX/Ligand and CuX2/Ligand<br>
Complexes in Different Solvents. CuBr (2.3 mg, 0.01 mmol) or CuBr2 (2.3 mg, 0.01 mmol) was<br>
placed in a quartz UV-VIS cell (1 mm path length) and purged with argon. To the cell was added<br><br>
3 mL of a deoxygenated stock solution of Me6-TREN in DMSO (0.76 mg/mL, 0.0033<br>
mmol/mL). The cell was sealed under argon via a rubber septum with a screw cap. After<br>
vigorous shaking, the cell was placed in the UV-VIS spectrometer for measurement. In the case<br>
of the CuBr/Me6-TREN complex, the UV-VIS spectra were taken after approximately 10 rain to<br>
allow the Cu(0) obtained by disproportionation to precipitate in the bottom of the quartz cell. The<br>
absorbance was recorded in the 200 - 1100 nm range.<br>
4. Synthesis<br>
A.	Typical Procedure for Cu(0) Catalyzed LRP of MA.<br>
[0077] The MA monomer (2 mL, 22.2 mmol), DMSO (1 mL), methyl 2-<br>
bromopropionate initiator (16.7 mg, 0.1 mmol), Me6-TREN (23 mg, 0.1 mmol), and Cu(0)<br>
powder (6.3 mg, 0.1 mmol) were added to a 25 mL Schlenk tube in the following order: Cu(0),<br>
MA, ligand, DMSO, initiator. The Schlenk tube containing the reaction mixture was then frozen<br>
in a dry ice/acetone bath at —78 °C and deoxygenated with three consecutive standard freeze-<br>
pump-thaw cycles. Subsequently, the Schlenk tube with the reaction mixture was placed in an oil<br>
bath (25 ±0.1 oC) with stirring. The side arm of the Schlenk tube was purged with argon and the<br>
polymerization reaction was sampled with an airtight syringe. The monomer conversion was<br>
determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, whereas the Mn and Mw/Mn values were determined by<br>
GPC withPMMA standards (conversion: 98 % (50 min), Mn GPC = 19,100, Mw/Mn = 1.21).<br>
B.	Typical Procedure for Cu(0) Catalyzed LRP of MMA.<br>
[0078] The monomer (MMA) (2 mL, 18.8 mmol), DMSO (1 mL), initiator (DCAP)<br>
(19.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), Cu(0) powder (6.3 mg, 0.1 mmol), and PMDETA ligand (17 mg, 0.1<br>
mmol) were added to a 25 mL Schlenk tube in the following order Cu(0), monomer, ligand,<br>
DMSO, initiator. The Schlenk tube was frozen in dry ice/acetone bath at -78 °C and<br>
deoxygenated with three standard freeze-pump-thaw cycles. After the final thaw, the Schlenk<br>
tube with containing the reaction mixture was placed in an oil bath (25 ± 0.1 °C) and stirred. The<br>
side arm of the Schlenk tube was purged with argon and the polymerization reaction was<br>
periodically sampled with an airtight syringe. The monomer conversion was determined by 1H-<br>
NMR spectroscopy and the Mn and Mw/Mn values were determined by GPC with PMMA<br>
standards (conversion: 84 % (300 min), Mn GPC = 20,000, Mw/Mn = 1.19).<br><br>
C.	Typical Procedure for Cu(0) Catalyzed LRP of VC<br>
[0079] In a typical experiment, a 50 mL Ace Glass 8648 #15 Ace-thred pressure tube<br>
equipped with bushing and a plunger valve was charged with 2 mL of a previously degassed<br>
stock solution of CHBr3 in DMSO (126 mg, 0.5 mmol CHBr3 in 10 mL DMSO). Cu(0) (6.3 mg,<br>
0.1 mmol) and TREN (14.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) were then added to the tube. The rube was filled with<br>
argon, closed, and frozen in acetone/dry ice bath at -78 oC. Then, precondensed VC<br>
(approximately 3 mL, 43 mmol) was added to the tube. The tube was closed and degassed<br>
through the plunger valve by applying vacuum and then filling the tube with argon 5 times. The<br>
valve was closed and the tube with reaction mixture was stirred in a water bath at 25 ± 0.1 °C.<br>
After appropriate reaction time, the tube was removed from the water bath and opened slowly to<br>
allow any unreacted VC to evaporate. The conversion of VC was determined gravimetrically.<br>
The reaction mixture was diluted with a small amount of THF (3 mL) and the mixture was<br>
slowly poured into MeOH (150 - 200 mL) with stirring. An aliquot from the reaction mixture<br>
was further diluted with THF and filtered through a 0.5 urn membrane filter. The filtrate was<br>
analyzed by GPC. The kinetic data was accumulated from individual experiments since sampling<br>
of the reaction was not possible (conversion: 85 % (180 min), MnGPC = 31,600, Mw/Mn =<br>
1.53)..<br>
D.	Typical Procedure for Synthesis of Low Molecular Weight PMA.<br>
[0080] In a typical polymerization experiment, catalyst Cu(0) (0.63 mg- 0.01 mmol) (or<br>
0.01 mmol of any Cu2X compound, where X = O, S, Se or Te), monomer MA (2mL, 22.2<br>
mmol), DMSO additive (1mL), M6Tren Ligand (2.3 mg, 001 mmol) where charged in a 25 mL<br>
schlenk tube. The initiator CHBR3 (25.2 mg, 0.1mmol) was added last to the polymerization<br>
mixture. The Schlenk tube was closed and the places in a dry ice/acetone bath (78 oC) in order to<br>
freeze the reaction mixture. The polymerization mixture was degassed through freeze-thaw-<br>
freeze cycles, filled with Ar gas and placed in an oil bath (25 ± 0.1 oC). The reaction mixture<br>
becomes slightly greenish after approximately 10-15 min. The polymerization stopped in 50 min.<br>
after reaction started. The Schlenk tube was opened and small aliquot of the polynwrizarion<br>
mixture was dissolved in CDCl3 and the conversion of MA was measured by 1H NMR. Another<br>
part of the aliquot from the reaction mixture was diluted with THF, filtered through 0.5-µm<br>
membrane filter and the molecular weight of the PMA was analyzed by GPC against PMMA<br>
standards. Conversion of MA 92 % (90 min). MnGPC= 17,800, Mw/Mn = 1.18. The rest of the<br>
reaction mixture was dissolved in 10 mL THF and the PMA was precipitated (gummy mass) in<br>
120 mL Methanol under stirring. The methanol was removed by decantation and the resulting<br><br>
gummy mass was washed again with MeOH to remove residual monomer and additive (2 X 50<br>
mL). Methanol was removed again by decantation and the final colorless PMA polymer was<br>
dried under vacuum until constant weight was reached. Note: it is remarkable that regardless the<br>
catalyst used the resulting PMA is colorless product after precipitation in MeOH.<br>
E.	Typical Procedure for Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecalar Weight PMA.<br>
[0081] In a typical experiment, MA monomer (2 mL, 22.2mmol), DMSO additive (1.6<br>
mL) where charged in a 25 mL schlenk tube. Because of very high DP used ([MA]0/[MPB]0<br>
11,100) it was only possible to add catalyst (Cu(0)), ligand (MgTren) and initiator (MPB) to the<br>
polymerization mixture using the stock solution/suspension. The Cu(0) catalyst (6.3 mg,<br>
0.1mmol) and the M6Tren ligand (23 mg., 0.1 mmol) were putted in degassed 10 mL DMSO.<br>
The vial containing above mixture were shaken intensively and 0.2 mL of these stock suspension<br>
containing Cu (0) catalyst (0.126 mg., 0.002 mmol) and M6Tren ligand (0.46 mg., 0.002 mmol)<br>
were taken out and added to a polymerization mixture. The stock solution of the initiator (MPB)<br>
was introduced in a similar manner. The, initiator MPB (25.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 10<br>
mL degassed DMSO and 0.2 mL of this solution containing MPB initiator (0.5 mg., 0.0019<br>
mmol) was added to the polymerization mixture. The schlenk tube was closed and the<br>
polymerization mixture was degassed using standard freeze-taw-freeze cycles. The shclenk tube<br>
was backfilled with Ar gas and places in an oil bath (25 ±0.1 °C). The reaction was stopped in<br>
550 min. The reaction mixture remained colorless even at the end of the reaction. The conversion<br>
and Mn and Mw/Mn were determined in a similar manner as descried previously. Conversion of<br>
MA 96 % (550min), MnGPC= 935,000, Mw/Mn = 1.17. the rest of the polymerization mixture<br>
was dissolved in 50 mL THF and the PMA was isolated in a similar manner as described in<br>
previous section.<br>
F.	Typical Procedure for Synthesis of 4 armed star PMA.<br>
[0082] In a typical polymerization experiment, Cu(0) (6.3 mg. 0.1 mmol), MA (1 mL,<br>
11.1 mmol), DMSO (0.5 mL), and Me6-TREN (2.3 mg, 0.1 mmol) were charged in a 25 mL<br>
Schlenk tube. The initiator 4BrPr (16.9 mg, 0.025 mmol) was added to the polymerization<br>
mixture last. The Schlenk tube was closed and placed in a dry ice/acetone bath (-78 °C) in order<br>
to freeze the reaction mixture. The polymerization mixture was degassed through freeze-pump-<br>
thaw cycles, filled with Ar gas and placed in an oil bath (25 ± 0.1 oC). The reaction mixture<br>
becomes greenish after approximately 10 min. The polymerization completed in 35 min. The<br>
Schlenk tube was opened, a small aliquot of the polymerization mixture was dissolved in CDCl3,<br><br>
and the conversion of MA was measured by 1H NMR. Another aliquot from the reaction<br>
mixture was diluted with THF, filtered through a 0.5-µm membrane filter, and the molecular<br>
weight of the PMA was analyzed by GPC against PMMA standards. Typical results were as<br>
follows: conversion of MA=97% (35 min), MnGPC= 39,300, Mw/Mn = 1.21. The remainder of<br>
the reaction mixture was dissolved in 10 mL THF and the resultant 4-armed PMA was<br>
precipitated (gummy mass) in 120 mL methanol with stirring. The methanol was removed by<br>
decantation and the gummy mass was washed again with MeOH to remove residual monomer<br>
and DMSO (2 x 50 mL). Methanol was removed again by decantation and the final colorless<br>
PMA was dried under vacuum until constant weight was reached. Note: it is remarkable that,<br>
regardless of the catalyst, the resulting 4-armed star PMA is colorless after precipitation in<br>
MeOH.<br>
G. Typical Procedure for Synthesis of PMMA.<br>
[0083] In a typical polymerization experiment, Cu(0) (6.3 mg. 0.1 mmol), MMA (2<br>
mL, 18.8 mmol), DMSO (1 mL) and PMDETA (17 mg, 0.1 mmol) were charged in a 25 mL<br>
Schlenk tube. The initiator DCAP (18.9 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added to the polymerization mixture<br>
last. The Schlenk tube was closed and then placed in a dry ice/acetone bath (-78 °C). The<br>
polymerization mixture was degassed through three freeze-pump-thaw cycles, filled with Ar gas,<br>
and placed in an oil bath (25 + 0.1 °C). The polymerization was stopped after 330 min. The<br>
Schlenk tube was opened and a small aliquot of the polymerization mixture was dissolved in<br>
CDCl3. The conversion of MMA was measured by 1H NMR. Another aliquot from the reaction<br>
mixture was diluted with THF, filtered through a 0.5-um membrane filter, and the molecular<br>
weight of the PMMA was analyzed by GPC against PMMA standards. Typical results were as<br>
follows: conversion of MMA=83% (330 min), MnGPC= 20,000, Mw/Mn =1.19. The rest of<br>
mixture was dissolved in 10 mL THF and the PMMA was precipitated (white powder) in 120<br>
mL methanol with stirring. The mixture was filtered and the resulting PMMA was washed with<br>
MeOH (50 mL), distilled water (50 mL), and again with MeOH (50 mL), and then dried under<br>
vacuum until a constant weight was obtained. The resulting PMMA is a white powder. No<br>
green color associated with Cu(II) species is visually detectable.<br>
5. Quantum Chemical Calculations<br>
[0084] All of the calculations were performed on a PC using Spartan' 04 Quantum<br>
Mechanics Program: (PC/ X 86). The geometry optimizations were performed using B3LYP<br>
functional. The 6-31+G* was used for all C, H, O, Cl, Br, S, and Se atoms. Since I and Te atoms<br><br>
are not included in the standard 6-31+G* basis set, they were described with the LACVP+* basis<br>
set. The systems containing unpaired electrons were optimized with the spin unrestricted<br>
formalism. The spin contamination was found to be negligible in these cases, since the value of<br><s> operator was always found to cluster around 0.75.<br>
[0085] The most stable conformation of MCP, MBP, MIP and corresponding free<br>
radicals has been reported to have the value of the central C-O-C(O)-C dihedral angle close to<br>
180o.9 The conformational analysis of MCP, MBP, MIP neutral molecules, corresponding<br>
radicals and radical anions performed at PM3 level indeed revealed that the most stable<br>
conformations of the above species have a central C-O-C(O)-C dihedral angle close to 180o. The<br>
geometries of these species were preliminary optimized at the PM3 level, followed by HF-DFT<br>
optimization at (U)B3LYP/6-31+G* or (U)B3LYP/LACVP+* level of theory. The C-X (X = Cl,<br>
Br, I) hemolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for MCP, MBP, and MIP were calculated<br>
using the formula: BDE = [Eabs(radical) + Eabs(atom)] -Eabs(neutral molecule). Radical-anions<br>
were optimized as follows: Neutral Molecule + 1 electron (charge = -1, spin multiplicity = 2).<br>
The C-X- bond heterolytic dissociation energy in radical anions were calculated using the<br>
formula: E = [Eabs(radical) + Eabs(X-)] -Eabs(neutral molecule). The homolytic BDE, the energy<br>
for radical-anion formation and energy of the radical-anion decomposition into radicals and<br>
anion (X-) were recalculated in kcal/mol (1 hartree = 627.509 kcal/mol).<br>
[0086] All geometry optimizations were performed without symmetry constraints (C1<br>
symmetry) in order to ensure that the resultant geometry is not a local minimum. The frequency<br>
calculations were performed to verify mat the optimized structures were the energy minima on<br>
the potential energy surface (no imaginary frequency). The absolute energies of the calculated<br>
species are reported without corrections for zero point vibrational energy. The energy of<br>
EHOMO for Cu(0), Cu20, Cu2S, Cu2Se, Cu2Te, CuCl, CuBr and CuI were calculated at<br>
(U)HF/6-31+G* (or (U)HF/LACVP+* for I and Te case) level on the (U)B3LYP/6-31+G* (or<br>
(U)B3LYP/LACVP+* for I and Te case) optimized geometries (except Cu(0)).<br>
[0087] A list of HF-DFT optimized geometries (Cartesian Coordinates) and absolute<br>
energies (in a u.) for all calculated species follow.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
6. Chain End Analysis of Pory(methyl)acrylates (PMA) Synthesized by Cu(0)-Mediated<br>
SET-LRP of MA Initiated with Haloforms.<br>
[0088] The 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectra of PMA prepared by SET-LRP of MA<br>
initiated with haloform initiators (CHX3, X = Cl, Br, I) and catalyzed either by Cu(0)/Me6-TREN<br>
or Cu(0)/TREN (with or without CuX2 deactivator) reveal the signals of the protons of the main-<br>
chain (methyne and methylene) are present in the region 1.31 - 2.52 ppm. The signal of OCH3<br>
side group appears at 3.60 ppm. Of special interest are the signals associated with the -CH2-<br>
CHXC(O)OMe (X = Cl, Br, and I) chain ends and the initiator fragments -CHX2 and -CHX- (X<br>
- Cl, Br, I). It is interesting to note that, in the case of CHCl3 and CHBr3 initiated SET-LRP of<br>
MA, the resulting polymers contain only -CHCl2 and -CHBr2 (signals at 5.65 and 5.60 ppm,<br>
correspondingly) fragments from the haloform initiators. The signals from the protons attached<br>
to the -HC-Cl and -HC-Br chain ends (-CH2-CHXC(O)OMe end groups) are observed at 4.19<br>
and 4.15 ppm, correspondingly. The integral ratio of-CHX and -CH2-CHXC(O)OMe (X = Cl,<br>
Br) signals is 1:1 and is the same for PMA samples isolated at low and high conversion of MA.<br>
The latter observation demonstrates that CHCl3 and CHBr3 compounds act as monofunctional<br>
initiators in these polymerizations. The comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of PMA obtained<br>
using two different catalysts (Cu(0)/Me6-TREN and Cu(0)/TREN/CuBr2) demonstrates that these<br>
two catalysts give the same chain end functionality in the resulting PMA.<br>
[0089] In the case of CHI3 initiator, the structure and chain end functionality of the<br>
PMA is a function of the conversion of MA. At low conversion, the PMA obtained is mostly<br><br>
growing in one direction (the signal at 4.97 ppm belongs to the-initiator fragment -CHI2 and the<br>
signal at 4.32 ppm is attributed to the terminal methyne proton -CH2-CHIC(O)OMe). The ratio<br>
of the integral of the signals observed at 4.32 and 4.97 ppm is 1:1 for the PMA polymers<br>
obtained at low conversion of MA. However, at high conversion, the intensity of-CHI2 signal<br>
(4.97 ppm) decreases by comparison with the -CHrCHIC(O)OMe group methyne signal. This<br>
means that, during polymerization, the PMA starts to grow in two directions. Unfortunately the<br>
signal of-CHI- proton, which should appear at around 2.1-2.2 ppm, is hidden inside the PMA<br>
main-chain proton signals. The 'H NMR spectra of the PMA obtained during SET-LRP of MA<br>
. initiated with CHI3 and catalyzed by Cu(0)/Me6-TREN or Cu(0)/TREN catalyst are almost<br>
identical, thus demonstrating that the chain end functionality of the resulting PMA does not<br>
depend on the catalyst structure.<br>
[0090] 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectra of poly-t-BuA (Figure 12) obtained during LRP of<br>
t-BuA initiated with the monofunctional MPB initiator and catalyzed by Cu(0)/Me6-TREN<br>
catalyst in DMF show signals at 1.08 -1.13 ppm belonging to the CH3- group from MPB<br>
initiator (adjacent to the -CH group). The signal at 3.62 ppm belongs to the OMe group from the<br>
MPB initiator. The multiplet in 4.04 -4.10 ppm region belongs to the terminal -CH2-<br>
CHBrC(O)O-t-Bu methyne proton signal. In all cases the NMR and GPC determined molecular<br>
weights are in good agreement, which further supports the correctness of the assignment of the<br>
1H NMR spectra of PMA obtained from SET-LRP of MA initiated with haloforms.<br>
7. Structural Analysis of Poly(t-butyl acrylate) and Poly(n-buryl acrylate).<br>
[0091] Structural Analysis of Poly(t-butyl acrylate) and Poly(n-buryl acrylate)by g<br>
HSQC and g HMBC. g-HSQC and g-HMBC NMR spectra of low molecular weight poly(t-butyl<br>
acrylate) and poly(n-butyl acrylate) recorded on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer show the<br>
detailed microstructure of these two polymers. gHSQC spectra of both samples show multiple<br>
resolved resonances in ΔH = 1 -3 - 2.0 ppm and δC = 34.0 - 38.0 ppm range for main chain CH2<br>
groups. Resonances from tetrad configurational structure (i.e. mmm, mrm, mmr, rarr, rrr, rmr)<br>
are well resolved along with many CH2 resonances from terminal groups. These resonance<br>
patterns are consistent with a higher syndiotactic content of the poly(t-butyl acrylate) and highly<br>
atactic nature of poly(n-butyl acrylate). This result is also weD complemented by the splitting<br>
pattern of main chain CH resonances: δH = 2.1 - 2.4 ppm and δC = 40.0 - 43.0 ppm. Previous<br>
NMR studies of these classes of polymers show that branches formed by intra- and<br>
intermolecular chain transfer reactions result in the formation of quaternary carbons at the<br>
branching point. A quaternary carbon at the branching point would show resonance in the 47.0 -<br><br>
48.5 ppm region in the 13C NMR spectrum. However, in these samples, we failed to detect any<br>
quaternary carbons in this region from the g-HMBC NMR spectrum. Also, the g-HMBC would<br>
show two bond correlations to protons of the CH2 and CH groups from the branched quaternary<br>
carbon. Failure to detect any such correlations (along with any detectable signal in 13C NMR<br>
spectrum) indicates the very low probability of a chain transfer reaction during this<br>
polymerization process. This result confirms that the polymers obtained at room temperature are<br>
mostly linear chains and, even if there are branched structures, they exist in such a small<br>
concentration that they are undetectable by multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.<br><br>
