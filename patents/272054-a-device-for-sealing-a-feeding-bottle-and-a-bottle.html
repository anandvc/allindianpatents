CLOSING DEVICE WITH INTEGRATED ROTARY CLOSURE FOR<br>
FEEDING BOTTLE AND BOTTLE<br>
While the feeding bottle, in its traditional form, has proved to be perfectly usable, there are nonetheless some remaining technical difficulties that mothers face on a daily basis. One of these difficulties that mothers face is that of being able always to keep the feeding bottle upright in any form of bag for example, because in any other position, since the neck of the feeding bottle is open, the liquid would easily flow to the tip of the teat and ultimately escape from the orifice (1) therein. Even if there is a cap (2) to protect the teat (3), the problem of liquid flowing out from the orifice (1) is not solved by the presence of this cap.<br>
The  object  of  this  invention  is  to  avoid  this ■ disadvantage  by  allowing  the  feeding  bottle  to  be sealed more re-liably using a sealing device.<br>
.■The ■ term feeding bottle (13) will be used here for any container chiefly comprising a container and a teat, which may contain a liquid, and which is intended for infants  (aged 0 to 2 years for example) . This liquid may be milk,  water or any other drink  (fruit juice, yoghurt, etc).<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a sealing device with built-in rotary closure, for a feeding bottle (13) . The attached drawings illustrate the invention:<br>
-	Figure 1  depicts  the  complete  sealing device  with built-in rotary closure, for a feeding bottle:<br>
-	Figure 2 depicts the built-in rotary closure detached from the teat (3) retaining ring (4):<br><br>
- Figure 3 shows the disks A and B of the internal (6) and external  (7)  ferrules  of the built-in  rotary closure.<br>
The sealing device with built-in rotary closure according to the invention consists of: two ferrules, an internal one (6) and an external one (7), all made of plastic, and acting as a rotary closure. Said rotary closure is inserted between a teat (3) introduced into a retaining ring (4) and the screw thread (12) of the feeding bottle (13).<br>
The retaining ring (4) has an internal screw thread (11) that allows it to be screwed directly onto the external screw thread (5) of the rotary closure.<br>
The internal ferrule- (6), via its internal screw thread (9), is screwed .directly onto the threaded neck (12) of the feeding bottle (13).<br>
The external ferrule (7) with its external screw thread<br>
(5) accepts, via the top, the teat (3) retaining 'ring<br>
(4) .	...       "'  ■••••<br>
These two ferrules, the internal one (6) and the external one (7) , which constitute the rotary closure, each have a disk - A in the case of the internal one and B in the case of the external one - which are in contact with one another, being connected by an internal pivot (B15 (fig. 3)) mounted on the inside, at the center of the external ferrule (7).<br>
Since the internal ferrule (6) is inset within the external ferrule (7) , the flange of the pivot that is not visible in the figures here, holds these ferrules together, the disk A of the internal ferrule (6) being in contact with the disk B of the external ferrule (7). A perforation (A17 (fig. 3) ) at the center of the disk A of the  internal  ferrule  (6)  allows  the  internal<br><br>
ferrule  (6)  to be inset within the external ferrule (7) .<br>
The rotary closure mechanism is afforded mainly by the internal and external ferrules, the disks A and B of which are superposed and each respectively has an off-centered opening (8) and (10) occupying more than H of its surface area. The external ferrule (7) has an outside diameter greater than that of the other elements of the device and has external ribs (B21 {fig. 3)) to allow it to be turned.<br>
In  the  direction  of  sealing,  in  the  rotational movement, there is some latitude for pivoting. The disk<br>
(B) of the external ferrule (7) is orientated in such a way that the openings (8) and (10) of the first (A) and second (B) disks respectively are offset, thus completely closing off the feeding bottle (13). A sealing gasket may be provided between the internal (6) and external  (7)  ferrules to make the feeding bottle<br>
(13) seal more reliably.<br>
In the direction of opening, in the rotational movement, the disk (B) of the external ferrule (7) is orientated in such a way that the openings (8) and (10) of the disks (A) and (B) respectively return to a position in which they face one another, allowing a liquid contained in the feeding bottle (13) to flow. A cap (2) is provided, for protecting the teat (3).<br>
The invention can also be put to use on disposable<br>
feeding bottles or bottles.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the profile of a plastic bottle<br>
fitted with the sealing device with built-in rotary<br>
closure.<br>
The sealing device of the invention can then be fixed<br>
to  the  bottle  permanently  by  crimping.  The  bottle<br><br>
comprises a container (19) with a closed bottom (20) and an unthreaded neck (21) onto which the sealing device is crimped once the bottle has been filled with the liquid. The container (19) and the sealing device become one integral part.<br>
The sealing device comprises not a teat but a drinking spout (50) fixed on top of the retaining ring (4). All the elements of the sealing device, namely the drinking spout (50), the retaining ring (4) and the two ferrules A and B are made as a single piece. Once the bottle has been filled with the liquid, this sealing device becomes an integral part of the container (19), except for the cap (2) designed to protect the drinking spout (50).<br>
The built-in rotary closure allows mothers to seal the child's feeding bottle or bottle of mineral water securely, with the possibility of keeping the remaining liquid for later use. Said feeding" bottle or said bottle is intended for drinks for infants aged 0 to 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
