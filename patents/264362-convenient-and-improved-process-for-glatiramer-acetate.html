It is a racemic mixture having the following structure of formula I:<br><br>
Paliperidone is a metabolite of Risperidone and marketed under the brand name INVEGA®. It is approved in United States for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
US 5,158,952 patent (henceforth '952) discloses for condensing 9- hydroxy-3-<br>

9-hydroxy-3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyriraidin-4-one of formula (II), which is a key intermediate of Paliperidone known from EP-0,368,388 and it's US equivalent Patent No.5,158,952 and has following structural formula: <br>
According to the generic disclosure of '952 patent preparation of a compound of formula (II) by catalytic hydrogenation (using palladium-on-charcoal and the like) of compound of formula (III) to obtain a compound of formula (IV) which is further converted into a compound of formula (II) by deprotection of benzyl group as mentioned in scheme I<br><br><br>

US '952 patent disclose that the staring materials are alternatively prepared by process given in the EP-A-0,196,132.<br>
W09623784 and WO2006027370 disclose process for the preparation of 9-hydroxy-3 -(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-4H-pyrido [ 1,2-a]pyrimidin-4one of formula VII by reacting 3-hydroxy-pyridin-2yl-amine with 2-acetyl-3-butyrolactone in an inert solvent and in presence of p-toluene sulfonic acid using water separator as mentioned in the following scheme.<br><br><br>

As discussed above none of the prior art teaches the synthesis of paliperidone of formula (I) in higher purity and hence industrially not viable. Like any synthetic compound, paliperidone can contain extraneous compounds or impurities that can come from many sources. They can be unreacted starting materials, by-products of the reaction, products of side reactions or degradation products. Impurities in paliperidone or any active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) are undesirable and, in extreme cases, might even be harmful to a patient being treated with a dosage form containing the API.<br>
