Break-resistant delayed release forms of administration<br>
The present invention relates to a form of administration for administering a physiologically<br>
active substance (A), wherein the form of administration is mechanically stabilised, so that it<br>
cannot be comminuted with conventional methods, such as pounding, crushing, grinding in a<br>
mortar, etc, or at least can only be comminuted with great difficulty. The substance (A) is<br>
released from the form of administration according to the invention under physiological<br>
conditions with an at least partially delayed profile.<br>
Numerous physiologically active substances, such as nutritional supplements, therapeutic<br>
agents, etc are produced as delayed-release formulations, ie, unlike the case with conventional<br>
formulations (eg so-called "immediate release" formulations), the release of the substances<br>
from these formulations into the organism is delayed for a comparatively long period, often<br>
amounting to several hours. The release of the substance from the form of administration on<br>
the one hand and metabolisation or excretion by the organism on the other, ensure a relatively<br>
uniform blood plasma level for the administered substance. As a consequence of this, it is<br>
frequently possible to reduce the number of dose units to be taken per day by patients, often,<br>
intake is only required once or twice a day.<br>
In certain cases, delayed-release formulations may also reduce the extent of the side effects of<br>
the substance. For example, some therapeutic agents result in intensified side effects if a<br>
specific concentration limit of the therapeutic agent is exceeded, at least transiently. Such<br>
therapeutic agents are, therefore, to a large extent, unsuitable for "immediate release"<br>
formulations, in particular if administration only two or three times daily is desirable.<br>
Medicinal agents of this kind therefore are usually administered as delayed-release<br>
formulations, whereby the continuous release of the active substance is ensured and the short-<br>
term occurrence of elevated concentrations is avoided.<br>
In the case of delayed-release formulations, the physiologically active substance is usually<br>
either embedded in a matrix that controls release, and/or the form of administration is coated<br>
with a film that controls release.<br>
1<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
However, elderly patients in particular frequently have difficulties taking solid forms of<br>
administration, such as tablets, gelatin capsules, etc. They choke on them and sometimes<br>
develop pronounced aversions to such forms of administration.<br>
To counter this, various types of apparatus have been developed by means of which solid<br>
forms of administration can be comminuted or pulverised ("tablet crusher"). This type of<br>
apparatus is used, for example, by the care staff in old people's homes. The forms of<br>
administration are then given to the people requiring care not as tablets etc, but as powder, in<br>
order, for example, to avoid the problems with swallowing tablets.<br>
However, the comminution of forms of administration with apparatus of this type is<br>
problematic if the forms of administration are delayed-release formulations. To be precise,<br>
comminution generally results in the destruction of the inner structure of the form of<br>
administration, which is responsible for the delayed release, thus cancelling out the delayed-<br>
release action. As a result of the comminution, the diffusion paths of the constituent<br>
physiologically active substances are shortened and/or the diffusion barriers removed. For<br>
example, after comminution, a delayed-release formulation in which the delayed release is to<br>
be achieved by means of a film coating only retains the film coating on a small percentage of<br>
its solid surface. As a consequence of this, after administration, frequently the entire amount<br>
of the physiologically active substance originally contained in the form of administration is<br>
released in a relatively short time, whereby a comparatively very high plasma concentration<br>
of the substance is achieved for a relatively short time. In this way, the original delayed-<br>
release formulations become "immediate release" formulations.<br>
However, depending upon the physiological effectiveness of the substance, this may cause<br>
considerable side effects, in extreme cases even the death of the patient. Examples of<br>
substances with a hazard potential of this type include anti-parkinson drugs, antiepileptics,<br>
antidiabetics, antihypertensive agents, antiarrhythmics, etc.<br>
As a rule, the people who comminute the forms of administration for themselves or for others<br>
are not aware of these risks. Deaths of patients are known which are probably attributable to<br>
the pulverisation of delayed-release formulations by nurses or carers. For further details,<br>
reference is made for example to JE Mitchell, Oral Dosage Forms That Should Not Be<br>

Delayed-release formulations can also create problems with small children. For example,<br>
children are often unable to distinguish solid forms of administration from sweets. If children<br>
find such forms of administration, for example because their parents have carelessly left them<br>
lying around in the home, there is a risk that the children may think the forms of<br>
administration are sweets, put them in their mouths and chew them. If this involves delayed-<br>
release formulations containing a therapeutic agent in a dose intended for adults, in such a<br>
case, the child is already at risk of an overdose due to the larger content of therapeutic agent.<br>
Chewing the form of administration and the associated cancellation of the delayed-release<br>
action intensifies this risk still further, since the already excessive dose is also released in a<br>
greatly reduced period of time, which would entail considerable risks even for an adult but<br>
could have consequences that are even more drastic for a child.<br>
Chewing delayed-release formulations can also lead to an overdose of the substance contained<br>
therein in adults. For example, adults sometimes chew the forms of administration quite<br>
deliberately, since, often in ignorance of the type and purpose of a delayed-release<br>
formulation, they hope this will achieve a quicker effect.<br>
A known possibility for reducing the risks resulting from the comminution of delayed-release<br>
formulations is to add antagonists, ie antidotes or compounds which produce physiological<br>
defence reactions, to the form of administration, wherein the physiological action of these<br>
additives is, if possible, only activated if the form of administration has been comminuted<br>
before administration. However, this method has the drawback that the physiologically active<br>
substance is nonetheless administered in non-delayed form and that the organism is<br>
additionally exposed to another physiologically active substance, for example an antidote, or<br>
that a defence reaction, such as vomiting, for example, is triggered.<br>
3<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
There is, therefore, a requirement for pharmaceutical forms of administration with delayed<br>
release that reduce the risk of overdose so that there is no need for antidotes, etc.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a form of administration having advantages<br>
over the forms of administration in the prior art. The form of administration should release a<br>
physiologically active substance with delayed release but reduce the risk of overdose, in<br>
particular as the consequence of improper handling of the form of administration, such as<br>
chewing, crushing, grinding in a mortar, etc.<br>
It was surprisingly found that this object is achieved by a form of administration comprising<br>
a physiologically active substance (A) (= component (A))<br>
optionally one or a plurality of physiologically compatible excipients (B) (= component<br>
(B)),<br>
a synthetic or natural polymer (C) (= component (C)) and<br>
optionally a natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic wax (D) (= component (D)),<br>
wherein the form of administration has a resistance to breaking of at least 400 N, preferably at<br>
least 420 N, more preferably at least 440 N, still more preferably at least 460 N, most<br>
preferably at least 480 N and in particular at least 500 N and, under physiological conditions,<br>
the physiologically active substance (A) is at least partially delayed. Consequently, the form<br>
of administration according to the invention comprises a physiologically active substance (A)<br>
with at least partially delayed release.<br>
The form of administration according to the invention exhibits mechanical strength over a<br>
wide temperature range, in addition to the resistance to breaking, optionally also sufficient<br>
hardness and impact strength, so that it is virtually impossible for it to be comminuted or<br>
pulverised by chewing, grinding in a mortar, pounding, etc. and also by means of<br>
commercially available apparatus for the pulverisation of conventional forms of<br>
administration. In this regard, this is not necessarily achieved by the hardness of the form of<br>
administration. For example, in particular its impact strength may have the result that,<br>
although it may be deformed due to an external mechanical action, for example by means of a<br>
hammer, it does not disintegrate into numerous fragments. Comminution is not even<br>
successful if the form of administration is first chilled to increase its brittleness, for example<br>
to temperatures below -25°C, -40°C or even in liquid nitrogen.<br>
4<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
As a consequence of this, delayed release is retained and an overdose due to incorrect<br>
handling of the form of administration is effectively prevented.<br>
The advantageous properties of the forms of administration according to the invention, in<br>
particular also their mechanical properties, cannot be automatically achieved by processing<br>
the components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D) by means of any conventional<br>
methods for the production of forms of administration. Instead, it is usually necessary to<br>
select suitable types of apparatus for production and set suitable parameters, in particular<br>
pressure/force, temperature and time. It is only when the components are exposed to a<br>
sufficient pressure at a sufficient temperature for a sufficient period during production that<br>
forms of administration with the desired properties are obtained. Therefore, even if<br>
conventional types of apparatus are used, it is usually necessary to adapt the production<br>
protocols in order to meet the required criteria.<br>
Delayed release according to the invention should preferably be understood to mean a release<br>
profile in which the physiologically active substance is released over a lengthy period with a<br>
reduced intake frequency with the object of an extended therapeutic action. In particular, this<br>
is achieved with peroral administration. The expression "with at least partially delayed<br>
release" covers according to the invention all forms of administration which ensure modified<br>
release of the physiologically active substances contained therein. The forms of<br>
administration are preferably coated or uncoated forms of administration that are produced<br>
with special excipients, with particular methods or by a combination of both options in order<br>
purposefully to change the release rate or the location of the release.<br>
The time profile of the release with the forms of administration according to the invention<br>
includes the following types: extended release, delayed release, repeat action release,<br>
prolonged release and sustained release.<br>
For the purposes of the description, "delayed release" preferably means the delayed release of<br>
the physiologically active substance for a defined finite time (lag time) after which release<br>
takes place unhindered. "Repeat action release" preferably defines the initial release of a first<br>
portion of the physiologically active substance followed by at least one further portion that is<br>
released following this. "Prolonged release" preferably defines release at a reduced rate in<br>
5<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
order to maintain therapeutic efficacy, reduce toxic effects or for other therapeutic reasons.<br>
"Sustained prolonged release" preferably defines a continuous release over a relatively long<br>
period in order to reduce the frequency of administration. For further details, reference is<br>
made for example, to KH Bauer, Lehrbuch der Pharmazeutischen Technologie, 6th Edition,<br>
WVG Stuttgart, 1999 and the European Pharmacopoeia.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, under physiological conditions, after 5 hours, the form of<br>
administration according to the invention has released at the most 99%, more preferably at the<br>
most 90%, more preferably at the most 75%, still more preferably at the most 50%, most<br>
preferably at the most 40% and in particular at the most 30% of the substance (A). In this<br>
regard, it is particularly preferable for the form of administration in this case to contain<br>
neither tramadol hydrochloride, nor oxycodone hydrochloride, more preferably no opioid<br>
[N02A] (for the meaning of "N02A" see below). The release is in this regard preferably<br>
determined using the standardised method in the European Pharmacopoeia, preferably under<br>
the conditions described in example 1.<br>
Preferably, under physiological conditions, the form of administration according to the<br>
invention releases the physiologically active substance (A) as follows: 0.1 to 75 % by weight<br>
after 30 minutes, 0.5 to 95 % by weight after 240 minutes, 1.0 to 100 % by weight after 480<br>
minutes and 2.5 to 100 % by weight after 720 minutes.<br>
Further preferred release profiles 1 to 5 are summarised in the following table [data in % by<br>
weight of released component (A)]:<br><br>
Time[h]	Nol	No 2	No 3	No 4	No 5<br>
1	0-30	0-50	0-50	15-25	20-50<br>
2	0-40	0-75	0-75	25-35	40-75<br>
4	3-55	3-95	10-95	30-45	60-95<br>
8	10-65	10-100	35-100	40-60	80-100<br>

Preferably, the release behaviour of the form of administration according to the invention is<br>
largely independent of the pH value of the release medium, that is, the release profile in<br>
6<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
artificial intestinal juice preferably corresponds substantially to the release profile in artificial<br>
gastric juice. Preferably, at any time during the measurement, the deviation of the two release<br>
profiles from each other is at the most 20%, more preferably at the most 15%, still more<br>
preferably at the most 10%, still more preferably at the most 7.5%, most preferably at the<br>
most 5.0% and in particular at the most 2.5%.<br>
Preferably, the form of administration according to the invention has uniform release<br>
behaviour. In this regard, preferably, the release behaviour of the physiologically active<br>
substance (A) is interindividually uniform (that is compared to the forms of administration<br>
produced using the same method) and/or uniform within a single form of administration (that<br>
is compared to partial segments of the same form of administration). Preferably, in a<br>
comparison of this kind of two samples each with a mass of preferably 500 mg, at any time of<br>
the measurement, the total amounts of the released active substance deviate from each other<br>
by at the most 20%, more preferably at the most 15%, still more preferably at the most 10%,<br>
still more preferably by at the most 7.5%, most preferably at the most 5.0% and in particular<br>
by at the most 2.5%.<br>
Preferably, the release profile of the form of administration according to the invention is<br>
stable in storage, preferably in storage at a high temperature, eg at 37°C, for 3 months in<br>
sealed containers. In this context, "stable in storage" means that, in a comparison of the initial<br>
release profile with the release profile after storage, the two release profiles deviated from<br>
each other by at the most 20%, more preferably by at the most 15%, still more preferably by<br>
at the most 10%, still more preferably by at the most 7.5%, most preferably by at the most<br>
5.0% and in particular by at the most 2.5%.<br>
By the use of certain polymers, in suitable quantities and under suitable conditions it is<br>
achieved according to the invention that the form of administration has a resistance to<br>
breaking of at least 400 N, preferably at least 420 N, more preferably at least 440 N, still more<br>
preferably at least 460 N, most preferably 480 N and in particular at least 500 N (measured as<br>
specified in the description; the preferred method for the determination of the resistance to<br>
breaking according to the invention is a modification of the method "Resistance to Crushing<br>
of Tablets" described in the European Pharmacopoeia 5,0 on page 235, 2.9.8). This enables<br>
comminution, eg pulverisation of the form of administration with conventional means, to be<br>
effectively prevented.<br>
7<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
According to the invention, comminution should be understood to mean the pulverisation of<br>
the form of administration under the application of force with conventional means, such as,<br>
for example, a mortar and pestle, hammer, mallet or other usual means for pulverisation, in<br>
particular also devices specially developed for this purpose (tablet crushers), wherein any<br>
fines that may occur (particle size equal to or smaller than 0.3 mm) must not exceed 5 % by<br>
weight.<br>
The form of administration according to the invention is therefore suitable for preventing an<br>
overdose of physiologically active substances, in particular of nutritional supplements and<br>
therapeutic agents, which are provided in delayed-release formulations. In this regard, it is<br>
possible to dispense with antidotes, irritants, etc. In addition to preventing overdoses and the<br>
accompanying risks for patients, the forms of administration according to the invention also<br>
ensure that the other advantages of the delayed-release formulation, such as for example<br>
uniform release over a lengthy period are retained and cannot be easily cancelled out.<br>
To achieve the necessary resistance to breaking of the form of administration according to the<br>
invention, at least one synthetic or natural polymer (C) is used, which contributes<br>
considerably to the increased resistance to breaking of the form of administration. The<br>
resistance to breaking of the form of administration is at least 400 N, preferably at least 420<br>
N, more preferably at least 440 N, still more preferably at least 460 N, most preferably at least<br>
480 N and in particular at least 500 N, wherein the resistance to breaking is determined<br>
according to method specified in the description. In a preferred embodiment, the resistance to<br>
breaking of the form of administration is at least 500 N, more preferably at least 600 N, more<br>
preferably at least 700 N, still more preferably at least 800 N, still more preferably at least<br>
900 N, most preferably at least 1000 N and in particular at least 1100 N.<br>
In addition to its resistance to breaking, the form of administration according to the invention<br>
is preferably also characterised by further mechanical properties, for example its hardness,<br>
impact resistance, impact elasticity and/or its modulus of elasticity, optionally also at low<br>
temperatures (eg below -24°C, below -40°C or in liquid nitrogen).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the form of administration according to the invention has a<br>
density of at least 0,80 or at least 0.85 g/cm3, more preferably at least 0.90 or at least 0.95<br>
8<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
g/cm3, still more preferably at least 1.00, at least 1.05 or at least 1.10 g/cm3, most preferably<br>
in the region of 0.80 to 1.35 g/cm3 and in particular in the region of 0.95 to 1.25 g/cm3.<br>
The form of administration according to the invention is characterised by a comparatively<br>
homogeneous distribution of density. Preferably, the densities of two partial segments of the<br>
form of administration each with a volume of 1.0 mm3 deviate from each other by at the most<br>
±10%, more preferably by at the most ±7.5%, still more preferably by at the most ±5.0%,<br>
most preferably by at the most ±2.5% and in particular by at the most ±1.0%.<br>
The form of administration according to the invention is characterised by a comparatively<br>
homogeneous distribution of the physiologically active substance (A). Preferably, the content<br>

still more preferably by at the most ±5.0%, most preferably by at the most ±2.5% and in<br>
particular by at the most ± 1.0%.<br>
The total weight of the form of administration according to the invention is preferably in<br>
region of 0.01 g to 1.5 g, more preferably of 0.05 g to 1.2 g, more preferably of 0.1 g to 1.0 g,<br>
most preferably of 0.2 g to 0.9 g and in particular of 0.25 g to 0.8 g.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the percentage by weight is more than 20 % by weight.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the form of administration according to the invention, it does<br>
not contain any psychotropically active substance. The person skilled in the art knows which<br>
substances have a psychotropic action. Substances that influence psychological processes<br>
commonly have a psychotropic action, ie a specific action on psychological functions. Thus,<br>
substances with a psychotropic action can influence moods, either raising them or lowering<br>
them. For the purposes of the description, substances with a psychotropic action include in<br>
particular opioids, stimulants, tranquillisers (barbiturates and benzodiazepines) and further<br>
narcotics. Preferably, substances with a psychotropic action are substances which, in<br>
particular when improperly administered (in particular with the intention of abuse) cause an<br>
accelerated increase in active ingredient levels compared to proper oral administration giving<br>
the abuser the desired effect, namely the "kick". This kick can be achieved for example if the<br>
powdered form of administration is administered nasally, ie sniffed. Preferably, substances<br>
with a psychotropic action are substances which (in the appropriate dose, form of<br>
administration and type of administration) influence human mental activity and/or sensory<br>
perception in such a way that they are in principle suitable for abuse.<br>
The following opiates, opioids, tranquillisers or other narcotics are substances with a<br>
psychotropic action and according to the invention therefore are preferably not contained in<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the form of administration according to the invention contains one<br>
substance (A) or a plurality of substances (A) selected from the group consisting of 1,1-(3-<br>
dimethylamino-3-phenylpentamethylen)-6-fluor-l,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano[3,4-b]indole, in<br>

thienyl)pentamethylen]-l,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano[3,4-b]-6-fluoro-indole, in particular its<br>
hemicitrate. The aforementioned substances are known in the prior art (see WO 2004/043967,<br>
WO 2005/066183).<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the achievement of the necessary resistance to breaking of the<br>
form of administration according to the invention, at least one natural, semi-synthetic or<br>
synthetic wax (D) can be used (= component (D)). Preferably, waxes with a softening point of<br>
at least 50°C, more preferably at least 55°C, still more preferably at least 60°C, most<br>
preferably at least 65°C and in particular at least 70°C. Particularly preferable are carnauba<br>
wax and beeswax. Quite particularly preferable is carnauba wax. Carnauba wax is a natural<br>
wax obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm and has a softening point of at least 80°C.<br>
With the additional use of the wax component, it is used together with at least one polymer<br>
(C) in such quantities that the form of administration has a resistance to breaking of at least<br>
400 N, preferably at least 500 N.<br>
Suitable for use as excipients (B) are the usual known excipients for the formulation of solid<br>
forms of administration. Preferably, these are plasticisers, such as triacetin and polyethylene<br>
28<br><br>

glycol, preferably a low-molecular polyethylene glycol, excipients, influencing the release of<br>
the active ingredient, preferably hydrophobic or hydrophilic, preferably hydrophilic polymers,<br>
quite particularly preferably hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and/or antioxidants. Preferably<br>

cellulose esters and/or acrylic resins. Quite particularly preferable used as matrix materials are<br>
ethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose, poly(meth)acryl acid and/or the derivatives thereof, such as the salts,<br>

Suitable antioxidants are ascorbic acid, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene<br>
(BHT), salts of ascorbic acid, monothioglycerol, phosphorous acid, vitamin C, vitamin E and<br>
the derivatives thereof, sodium bisulfite, particularly preferably butylhydroxytoluene or<br>
butylhydroxyanisole and a-tocopherol.<br>
The antioxidant is preferably in quantities of 0.01 to 10 % by weight, preferably 0.03 to 5 %<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the form of administration.<br>
The forms of administration according to the invention are characterised by the fact that due<br>
to their resistance to breaking, they cannot be pulverised by means of the usual comminution<br>
means, such as a mortar and pestle. This means an overdose is virtually impossible. However,<br>
in order further to increase the resistance to breaking of the form of administration, the forms<br>
of administration according to the invention can contain further means for enhancing<br>
resistance to breaking as excipients (B).<br>
The form of administration according to the invention is preferably solid and is suitable for<br>
oral, vaginal or rectal, preferably oral administration. It is preferably not in film form. In a<br>
further preferred embodiment, the form of administration according to the invention is present<br>
in the form of a tablet, a capsule or in the form of an oral osmotic therapeutic system (OROS).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the form of administration according to the invention is present as<br>
a tablet.<br>
The form of administration according to the invention can be present in multiparticulate form,<br>
preferably in the form of microtablets, microcapsules, micropellets, granules, spheroids, beads<br>
29<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
or pellets, optionally packaged into capsules or press into tablets, preferably for oral<br>
administration. Hereby, preferably the individual particles as such have a resistance to<br>
breaking of at least 400 N, optionally also a tablet produced therefrom.<br>
Preferably, the multiparticulate forms have a size or size distribution in the region of 0.1 to 3<br>
mm, in particular preferably in the region of 0.5 to 2 mm. Depending upon the desired form of<br>
administration, the usual excipients (B) are optionally also used for the formulation of the<br>
form of administration.<br>
The form of administration according to the invention can be produced by different methods,<br>
which are explained in greater detail below; the invention also relates to forms of<br>
administration obtainable by any of these methods:<br>
The method to produce of the form of administration according to the invention preferably<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)	mixing of component (A), optionally (B), (C), optionally (D),<br>
(b)	optionally preforming the mixture obtained from  step (a) mixture,  preferably by<br>
applying heat and/or force to the mixture obtained from (a), wherein the quantity of heat<br>
supplied is preferably not sufficient to heat component (C) to its softening point,<br>
(c)	hardening of the mixture by applying heat and force, wherein the supply of heat can<br>
take place during and/or before the application of force and quantity of heat supplied is<br>
sufficient to heat the component (C) at least to its softening point,<br>
(d)	optionally singulating the hardened mixture,<br>
(e)	optionally shaping the form of administration and<br>
(f)	optionally coating with a film coating.<br>
The heat can be supplied directly or by means of ultrasound. The application of force and/or<br>
the shaping of the form of administration can take place, for example, by direct tabletting or<br>
30<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
by means of suitable extruders, in particular with twin-screw extruders (roller die extruders)<br>
or planetary gear extruders.<br>
The following method variants are particularly preferable:<br>
Method variant 1:<br>
In this embodiment, the form of administration according to the invention is preferably<br>
produced without the use of an extruder, wherein preferably components (A), optionally (B),<br>
(C) and the optionally present component (D) are mixed and the resulting mixture, optionally<br>
after granulation, is shaped into the form of administration with the preceding or simultaneous<br>
application of heat.<br>
This heating and application of force to produce the form of administration is performed<br>
without the use of an extruder.<br>
The mixing of the components (A), optionally (B), (C) and optionally (D) is performed in a<br>
mixer known to the person skilled in the art. The mixer can be for example a roll mixer,<br>
shaking mixer, shear mixer or compulsory mixer.<br>
The resultant mixture is preferably shaped directly into the form of administration according<br>
to the invention by the application of force with the preceding or simultaneous application of<br>
heat. For example, the mixture can be shaped into tablets by direct tabletting. With direct<br>
tabletting with the simultaneous application of heat, the tabletting tool, ie the lower punch,<br>
upper punch and the die, is used to heat mixture to be pressed to at least the softening point of<br>
the polymer component (C) and then pressed. With direct tabletting with the preceding<br>
application of heat, the material to be pressed is heated immediately prior to tabletting to at<br>
least the softening point of the component (C) and then pressed by means of the tabletting<br>
tool.<br>
So, for example, a tabletting tool with upper punch, lower punch and die for tablets with a 10<br>
mm diameter and a radius of curvature of 8 mm can be used to press 300 mg of powder<br>
mixture at a temperature of 80°C, wherein the pressure resulting from application of a force of<br>
for example 2 kN or 4 kN can be maintained for 15 s, for example.<br>
31<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
The resultant mixture of the components (A), optionally (B), (C) and optionally component<br>
(D) can also be first granulated and then be shaped into the form of administration according<br>
to the invention under the application of force with the preceding or simultaneous application<br>
of heat.<br>
Each time force is applied, this is continued until the form of administration has achieved a<br>
breaking resistance of at least 400 N, 420 N, 440 N, 460 N, 480 N, preferably at least 500 N.<br>
The granulation can be performed in known granulators by moist granulation or melt<br>
granulation.<br>
Each of the known method steps, in particular the heating and simultaneous or subsequent<br>
application of force to produce of the form of administration according to the invention is<br>
performed without the use of an extruder.<br>
Method variant 2:<br>
In this method variant, the form of administration according to the invention is produced by<br>
thermoforming by means of an extruder without thereby any discoloration of the extrudate<br>
being observed.<br>
To investigate the degree of discoloration caused by this thermoforming, the colour of the<br>
mixture of the starting components of which the form of administration consists is first<br>
determined without the addition of a colour-imparting component, such as, for example, a<br>
coloured pigment or a coloured component (eg oc-tocopherol). This composition is then<br>
thermoformed according to the invention, wherein all method steps including the cooling of<br>
the extrudate are performed under an inert gas atmosphere. By way of comparison to this, the<br>
same composition is produced using the same method but without an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The coloration is determined of the form of administration produced according to the<br>
invention from the starting composition and the form of administration produced for purposes<br>
of comparison. The determination is performed with the assistance of "Munsell Book of<br>
Colour" from Munsell Colour Company Baltimore, Maryland, USA, 1966 edition. If the<br>
coloration of the form of administration thermoformed according to the invention has a<br>
32<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
coloration with the identification No N 9.5/ but at the most a coloration with the identification<br>
No 5Y 9/1, the thermoforming is classed as being "without discoloration". If the form of<br>
administration has a coloration with the identification No 5Y 9/2 or more, determined in<br>
accordance with the Munsell Book of Colour, the thermoforming is classed as being "with<br>
discoloration".<br>
Surprisingly, the forms of administration according to the invention exhibit no discoloration<br>
that can be classified in accordance with the above classification if the entire production<br>
method is performed under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably under a nitrogen atmosphere<br>
by means of an extruder for thermoforming.<br>
This variant according to the invention for the production of the forms of administration<br>
according to the invention is characterised by the fact that<br>
z) components (A), optionally (B), (C) and the optionally present component (D) are mixed,<br>
y) the resultant mixture is heated in the extruder to at least the softening point of component<br>
(C) and extruded by the application of force through the outlet orifice of the extruder,<br>
x) the still plastic extrudate is singulated and shaped into the form of administration or<br>
w) the cooled and optionally reheated singulated extrudate is shaped into the form of<br>
administration,<br>
wherein the method steps y) and x) and optionally the method steps z) and w) are performed<br>
under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The mixing of the components according to method step z) can also take place in the extruder.<br>
The mixture of components (A), optionally (B), (C) and optionally (D) can also be performed<br>
in a mixer known to the person skilled in the art. The mixer can be for example a roll mixer,<br>
shaking mixer, shear mixer or compulsory mixer.<br>
33<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
Before mixing with the further components, component (C) and the optionally present<br>
component (D) according to the invention is preferably provided with an antioxidant. This can<br>
take place by mixing the two components (C) with the antioxidant, preferably by dissolving<br>
or suspending the antioxidant in a highly volatile solvent and homogeneously mixing this<br>
solution or suspension with component (C) and the optionally present component (D) and<br>
removing the solvent by drying, preferably under an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The, preferably molten, mixture which has been heated in the extruder to at least the softening<br>
point of component (C) is extruded from the extruder through a die with at least one bore.<br>
The performance of the method process according to the invention requires the use of suitable<br>
extruders, preferably screw extruders (roller die extruders), wherein extruders which are<br>
equipped with two screws (rollers) are particularly preferred.<br>
The extrusion is preferably performed so that the expansion of the extruded strand is<br>
preferably at the most 50%, ie, that when using an extrusion die with a diameter of 6 mm for<br>
example, the extruded strand should have a diameter of at the most 9 mm. More preferably,<br>
the expansion of the strand is at the most 40%, still more preferably at the most 35%, most<br>
preferably at the most 30% and in particular at the most 25%. It has surprisingly been found<br>
that if the extruded material in the extruder is exposed to a severe mechanical stress, a<br>
significant expansion of the strand occurs thereby resulting in undesirable irregularities of the<br>
properties, in particular the mechanical properties, of the extruded strand.<br>
Preferably, the extruder comprises at least two temperature zones, wherein in the first zone,<br>
which is downstream from a feed zone and optionally a mixing zone, the heating of the<br>
mixture takes place up to at least the softening point of component (C). The throughput of the<br>
mixture is preferably from 2.0 kg to 8.0 kg/hour.<br>
After heating to at least the softening point of component (C), the molten mixture is conveyed<br>
by means of screws, further homogenised, compressed or compacted, so that, immediately<br>
before emerging from the extruder die, it has a minimum pressure of 5 bar, preferably of at<br>
least 10 bar, and is extruded through the die as an extruded strand or extruded strands,<br>
depending on the number of bores which the die comprises. The die geometry or the geometry<br>
of the bores is freely selectable. For example, the die or the bores can have a round, oblong or<br>
34<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
oval cross section, wherein the round cross section preferably has a diameter of 0.1 mm to 15<br>
mm and the oblong cross section preferably has a maximum lengthwise extension of 21 mm<br>
and a crosswise extension of 10 mm. Preferably, the die or the bores have a round cross<br>
section. The casing of the extruder used according to the invention can be heated or cooled.<br>
The corresponding temperature control, ie heating or cooling, is arranged so that the mixture<br>
to be extruded has at least an average temperature (product temperature) corresponding to the<br>
softening point of component (C) and does not rise above a temperature at which the<br>
physiologically active substance (A) to be processed may be damaged. Preferably, the<br>
temperature of the mixture to be extruded is adjusted to below 180°C, preferably below<br>
150°C, but at least to the softening temperature of component (C).<br>
After the extrusion of the molten mixture and, optionally, cooling of the extruded strand or<br>
the extruded strands, the extrudates are preferably singulated. This singulation can preferably<br>
be performed by cutting up the extrudates by means of revolving or rotating knives, water jet<br>
cutters, wires, blades or by means of laser cutters.<br>
An inert gas atmosphere is not necessary for the intermediate or final storage of the optionally<br>
singulated extrudate or the final shape of the form of administration according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The singulated extrudate may be pelletised with conventional methods or be pressed into<br>
tablets in order to impart the final shape to the form of administration. It is, however, also<br>
possible not to singulate the extruded strands and, and by means of contrarotating calender<br>
rolls comprising opposing recesses in their outer sleeve, to form them into the final shape,<br>
preferably a tablet, and to singulate these by conventional methods<br>
If the optionally singulated extrudate is not immediately to be shaped into the final shape, but<br>
instead cooled for storage, after the period of storage, an inert gas atmosphere, preferably a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere, should be provided and must be maintained during heating of the stored<br>
extrudate up until plasticisation and final shaping into the form of administration.<br>
The application of force in the extruder onto the at least plasticised mixture is adjusted by<br>
controlling the rotational speed of the conveying device in the extruder and the geometry<br>
thereof and by dimensioning the outlet orifice in such a manner that the pressure necessary for<br>
35<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
extruding the plasticised mixture is built up in the extruder, preferably immediately prior to<br>
extrusion. The extrusion parameters necessary for each particular composition to produce a<br>
form of administration with a resistance to breaking of at least 400 N, preferably of at least<br>
500 N, can be established by simple preliminary testing.<br>
Suitable for extrusion is, for example, a twin-screw-extruder made by the Leistritz,<br>
(Nuremberg) of the type Micro 27 GL 40 D, screw diameter 18 mm. Screws having eccentric<br>
screw tips may be used. A round-section die with a diameter of 8 mm can be used as a die.<br>
The entire extrusion method should be performed under a N2 atmosphere. The extrusion<br>
parameters can be adjusted, for example, to the following values: screw speed: 100 rpm,<br>
throughput: 4 kg/h; product temperature: 125°C; and casing temperature: 120°C.<br>
Method variant 3:<br>
With this method variant to produce the form of administration according to the invention,<br>
heat is supplied by means of ultrasound.<br>
To this end, first of all a homogeneous mixture of at least component (A) and component (C)<br>
(= binder) is produced. Further excipients, such as for example fillers, plasticisers, lubricants<br>
or dyes, may also be incorporated into this mixture. A low molecular weight polyethylene<br>
glycol is preferably used as a plasticiser.<br>
Mixing may be performed by means of conventional mixers. Examples of suitable mixers are<br>
roll mixers, which are also known as tumbler, drum or rotary mixers, container mixers, barrel<br>
mixers (drum hoop mixers or tumbling mixers) or shaking mixers, shear mixers, compulsory<br>
mixers, plough bar mixers, planetary kneader-mixers, Z kneaders, sigma kneaders, fluid<br>
mixers or high-intensity mixers.<br>
The selection of the suitable mixer is determined inter alia by the free-flowing properties and<br>
cohesive strength of the material to be mixed.<br>
The mixture is then subjected to shaping. The mixture is preferably shaped during or after the<br>
application of ultrasonication, preferably by compaction.<br>
36<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
During the ultrasonication, it is particularly preferable that there is direct contact between the<br>
mixture and the sonotrode of the ultrasound device. An ultrasound device as shown in Figure<br>
1 is preferably used in the method according to the invention<br>
In this Figure 1,(1) denotes the press, with which the necessary force is applied, (2) the<br>
converter, (3) the booster, (4) the sonotrode, (5) the shaping die, (6) the lower punch, (7) the<br>
base plate, (8) and (9) the ultrasound generator and device controller. The reference numbers<br>
used relate solely to Figure 1.<br>
During the ultrasonication, a frequency of 1 kHz to 2 MHz, preferably of 15 to 40 kHz,<br>
should be maintained. The ultrasonication should be performed until softening of the polymer<br>
(C) is achieved. This is preferably achieved within a few seconds, particularly preferably<br>
within 0.1 to 5 seconds, preferably 0.5 to 3 seconds.<br>
The ultrasonication and the application of force ensure uniform energy transfer thus achieving<br>
the rapid and homogeneous sintering of the mixture. This produces forms of administration<br>
with a resistance to breaking of at least 400 N, preferably of at least 500 N, which hence<br>
cannot be pulverised.<br>
Before shaping is performed, the mixture may be granulated after the mixing operation, after<br>
which the resultant granules are shaped into the form of administration, such as tablets, by<br>
ultrasonication and the application of force.<br>
Granulation may be performed in machinery and apparatus known to the person skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
If granulation is performed as wet granulation, water or aqueous solutions, such as for<br>
example ethanol/water or isopropanol/water, may be used as the granulation liquid.<br>
The mixture or the granules produced therefrom may also be subjected to melt extrusion for<br>
further shaping, wherein the mixture is converted into a melt by ultrasonication and the<br>
application of force and then extruded through dies. The strands or strand obtained in this<br>
manner may be singulated to the desired length using known devices. The shaped articles<br>
singulated in this manner may optionally furthermore be converted into the final shape with<br>
ultrasonication and application of force.<br>
37<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
The final shaping to the form of administration is preferably performed by the application of<br>
force in appropriate moulds.<br>
The above-described formed articles may also be produced according to a calendering process<br>
by initially plasticising the mixture or the granules produced therefrom by means of<br>
ultrasonication and the application of force and extruding through a suitable die. These<br>
extrudates are then shaped into the final shape between two contrarotating shaping rolls,<br>
preferably under the application of force.<br>
As already mentioned, shaping to produce the final shape of the form of administration by<br>
using a mixture of substance (A) and the polymer (C) with a resistance to breaking of at least<br>
400 N, preferably of at least 500 N, is preferably performed in powder form by direct<br>
compression with the application of force, wherein ultrasonication of this mixture is provided<br>
before or during the application of force. The force is at most the force that is conventionally<br>
used for shaping forms of administration such as tablets, or for pressing granules into the<br>
corresponding final shape.<br>
The tablets produced according to the invention may also be multilayer tablets.<br>
In the case of multilayer tablets, at least the layer that contains substance (A) should be<br>
exposed to ultrasound and the application of force.<br>
The corresponding necessary application of force may also be applied to the mixture by<br>
means of extruder rolls or calender rolls. Preferably, the shaping of the forms of<br>
administration is performed by the direct pressing of a powdered mixture of the components<br>
of the form of administration or corresponding granules formed therefrom, wherein<br>
ultrasonication is preferably performed during or before shaping. Such exposure is continued<br>
until the polymer (C) has softened, which is conventionally achieved in less than 1 second to<br>
at most 5 seconds.<br>
Suitable as a press is, for example, a Branson WPS, 94-003-A, Pneumatic (Branson<br>
Ultraschall, Dietzenbach, Germany) with a plain press surface. A suitable generator (2000 W)<br>
is, for example, a Branson PG-220A, 94-001-A analogue (Branson Ultraschall) with a<br>
38<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
sonotrode diameter of 12 mm. A die with a diameter of 12 mm can be used, whereby the<br>
bottom of the die is formed by a lower punch with a plain press-surface and a diameter of 12<br>
mm. Suitable parameters for plastification are frequency: 20 kHz; amplitude: 50%; force: 250<br>
N. The ultrasonication and the application force by means of the sonotrode may be<br>
maintained for 0.5 seconds, for example, wherein the ultrasonication and application of force<br>
preferably take place simultaneously.<br>
Method variant 4:<br>
With this method variant to produce the form of administration according to the invention,<br>
components (A), (C) and optionally (D) and optionally present excipients (B), such as<br>
antioxidants, plasticisers and/or release-delaying excipients are processed by means of a<br>
planetary-gear extruder to produce the form of administration according to the invention.<br>
Planetary-gear extruders are known and described inter alia in detail in the Handbuch der<br>
Kunststoff-Extrusionstechnik I (1989) "Grundlagen" in Chapter 1.2 "Klassifizierung von<br>
Extrudern", pages 4 to 6. The corresponding description is hereby introduced as a reference<br>
and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
The following explains the use of a planetary-gear extruder in the method according to the<br>
invention with reference to Figures 2 and 3. These explanations are given merely by way of<br>
example and do not restrict the general concept of the invention<br>
Figure 2     shows a section through a planetary gear extruder and<br>
Figure 3     shows the mode of operation of the planetary gear extruders.<br>
Figure 2 shows a planetary-gear extruder that may be used in the method according to the<br>
invention. This extruder substantially comprises a shaft 1, which, relative to the direction of<br>
transport of the mixture of the components listed above to be extruded, is initially constructed<br>
as a feed screw 5 and subsequently as the central spindle 3 of the planetary-gear extruder.<br>
Around the central spindle 3, there are preferably arranged three to seven planetary spindles 4,<br>
which are in turn surrounded by a casing in the form of a housing 6.<br>
39<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
In the planetary-gear extruder, the extrusion of the composition used in the method according<br>
to the invention for the production of a form of administration preferably proceeds as follows,<br>
with reference to Figure 2. As shown by the arrow 2, the components to be extruded are<br>
apportioned by the apportioning unit 7 in the area of the feed screw 5 and conveyed by the<br>
rotation thereof (drive not shown) in the direction of the central spindle 3. The person skilled<br>
in the art will understand that it is possible to mix the starting materials (components) in the<br>
area of the feed screw. However, it is also possible to premix the components of the form of<br>
administration and to apportion this mixture via the apportioning unit 7 in the area of the feed<br>
screw 5. The mixture is conveyed into the feed zone of the planetary-gear extruder. By<br>
heating to at least the softening point of component (C), the mixture is melted and the molten<br>
mixture is conveyed into the area of the central spindle, ie the extrusion zone, by the<br>
interaction of the central spindle 3 and the planetary spindles 4, further homogenised,<br>
compressed or compacted and extruded through the die 8 as an extruded strand or extruded<br>
strands, depending on how many bores the die comprises. The die geometry or the geometry<br>
of the bores is freely selectable. Thus, the die or the bores may exhibit a round, oblong or oval<br>
cross-section, wherein the round cross-section preferably has a diameter of 0.1 mm to 15 mm<br>
and the oblong cross-section preferably has a maximum lengthwise extension of 21 mm and a<br>
crosswise extension of 10 mm. The extrusion die may also take the form of a slot die.<br>
Preferably, the die or the bores have a round, oval or oblong cross-section. Both the casing 6<br>
of the planetary-gear extruder used according to the invention and the central spindle may be<br>
heated or cooled. The corresponding temperature control, i.e. heating or cooling, is so<br>
arranged that the mixture to be extruded exhibits an average temperature corresponding to the<br>
softening point of component (C) and does not rise above a temperature at which the<br>
substance (A) to be processed may be damaged. Preferably, the temperature of the mixture to<br>
be extruded is adjusted to below 180°C, preferably below 150°C, but at least to the softening<br>
point of component (C). The reference numbers used relate solely to Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Following the extrusion of the molten mixture and, optionally, cooling of the extruded strand<br>
or extruded strands, the extrudates are singulated (not shown in Figure 2). This singulation<br>
can preferably be performed by cutting up the extrudates by means of revolving or rotating<br>
knives, water jet cutters, wires, blades or with the assistance of laser cutters.<br>
40<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
Optionally after further cooling of the singulated extrudates, which are preferably present in<br>
the form of disks, they are optionally re-shaped into the final shape of the form of<br>
administration, wherein they can be exposed to heat again if necessary.<br>
This shaping, for example into tablets, may proceed in that the plastic extrudate is shaped<br>
with press-forming with the assistance of two contrarotating rolls preferably with mutually<br>
opposing recesses for plastification in the roll sleeve, with the design of the recesses<br>
determining the tablet shape.<br>
However, it is also possible to form the tablets from the singulated extrudates in each case<br>
with the assistance of an optionally heated die and at least one shaping punch. To this end, the<br>
cylindrical granules obtained after singulation of the extruded strand can preferably be used.<br>
Apart from being pressed into tablets, these granules or other multiparticulate shapes<br>
obtained, such as pellets or spheroids, can also be packaged into capsules in order to be used<br>
as a form of administration produced according to the invention.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the extruded strands extruded through a plurality of bores<br>
in the extrusion die can, after cooling thereof, optionally be brought together by interlacing or<br>
wrapping in the manner of rope production to produce a thicker strand than the individual<br>
extruded strands. This strand can optionally be further processed by partially dissolving with a<br>
suitable solvent or by heating to the softening point of the polymer (C) and optionally<br>
removing the solvent in accordance with the above-stated singulation and shaping of an<br>
individual strand.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-section through the planetary-gear extruder. Around the rotating<br>
central spindle 3 there are arranged at least three, in the case illustrated 6, planetary spindles<br>
4, the flanks 41 of which interact on the one hand with the flank 31 of the central spindle 4<br>
and on the other hand with the flanks 61 of the casing 6 of the planetary-gear extruder. The<br>
rotation of the central spindle 3 and the rolling of the respective flanks over one another cause<br>
the planetary spindles 4 each to rotate around their own axis, as shown by arrow 42, and<br>
around the central spindle 4, as shown by arrow 43. In this way, the compression or<br>
compaction sought according to the invention of the component mixture used according to the<br>
invention of the forms of administration produced according to the invention is achieved. The<br>
reference numbers used relate solely to Figures 2 and 3.<br>

If necessary, the planetary-gear extruder used can comprise not only an extrusion zone but<br>
also at least one further zone, in order that the mixture to be extruded can also optionally be<br>
degassed.<br>
The process according to the invention can be performed discontinuously or continuously,<br>
preferably continuously.<br>
A suitable extruder is, for example, a planetary gear extruder with four planetary spindles of<br>
the type BCG 10 (LBB Bohle, Ennigerloh, Germany) with an extrusion die with a diameter of<br>
8 mm. A gravimetrical dosing of 3.0 kg/h is suitable. The extrusion can be performed, for<br>
example, with a rotational speed of 28.6 rpm and a product temperature of about 88°C.<br>
Method variant 5:<br>
This variant for the production of the form of administration according to the invention is<br>
performed by processing at least the components (A), (C) and optionally (D) and optionally<br>
present excipients (B), such as antioxidants, plasticisers and/or release-delaying excipients,<br>
with the addition of a solvent for component (C), ie for the polymer or polymers (C), to<br>
produce the form of administration.<br>
To this end, components (A), optionally (B), (C) and the optionally present component (D)<br>
are mixed and, after addition of the solvent and optionally after granulation, the resultant<br>
formulation mixture is shaped to produce the form of administration.<br>
The mixing of components (A), optionally (B), C and optionally (D) is performed in a mixer<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. The mixer can be, for example, a roll mixer, shaking<br>
mixer, shear mixer or compulsory mixer.<br>
The solvent for the polymer (C) is added at least in such quantities that the formulation<br>
mixture is uniformly moistened<br>
Suitable solvents for the polymer (C) are preferably aqueous solvents, such as water, mixtures<br>
of water and aliphatic alcohols, preferably Cl to C6 alcohols, esters, ethers, hydrocarbons,<br>
42<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
particularly preferably distilled water, short-chain alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, butanol or aqueous alcohol solutions.<br>
The solvent is preferably added under agitation. The uniformly moistened composition is then<br>
dried. Drying preferably proceeds by the application of heat at temperatures at which it is<br>
possible to rule out any discoloration of the composition. This temperature can be established<br>
by simple preliminary testing.<br>
Before or after the drying, the composition can be divided into sub-portions that preferably in<br>
each case correspond to the mass of a unit of the form of administration. The corresponding<br>
dried portions are then shaped to produce the form of administration.<br>
This is preferably performed by using tablet presses.<br>
It is also possible to moisten the formulation mixture that, before addition of the solvent, the<br>
•formulation mixture is divided, preferably in moulds, into sub-portions, dispersed in a liquid<br>
dispersant with stirring and then the solvent is added. Component (C) is not soluble in the<br>
dispersant, which must be miscible with the solvent.<br>
Suitable dispersants are preferably hydrophilic solvents, such as aliphatic alcohols, ketones,<br>
esters. Short-chain alcohols are preferably used.<br>
Alternatively, the formulation mixture can also be moistened in such a manner that the<br>
solvent is incorporated into the formulation mixture as a foam. Such a foam of the solvent is<br>
preferably produced with the means of a high-speed mixer, preferably with the addition of<br>
conventional foam stabilisers. Suitable stabilisers are, for example, hydrophilic polymers such<br>
as for example hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
Preferably, the foam is also incorporated into the formulation mixture under agitation which<br>
preferably results in a granulated composition.<br>
Before or after being divided into sub-portions, which preferably correspond to the mass of a<br>
unit of the form of administration, the granulated composition is dried and then shaped into<br>
the form of administration.<br>
43<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
Drying and shaping can preferably proceed as described above. The method according to the<br>
invention can also be performed in such a manner that solvent is added to the formulation<br>
mixture in such a quantity that a shapeable paste is obtained.<br>
Before or after being dried, which may be performed as explained above, a paste of this kind<br>
can be divided into sub-portions and the dried portions, after further division in each case into<br>
a portion corresponding to the mass of a unit of the form of administration, are shaped or<br>
converted to yield the form of administration.<br>
It is possible int his regard to form the sub-portions in the form of strands, which may be<br>
produced by means of a screen or a strand former. The dried strands are preferably singulated<br>
and shaped to produce the form of administration. This shaping is preferably performed by<br>
means of a tablet press, using shaping rollers or shaping belts equipped with rollers.<br>
It is also possible to convert the paste into a planar structure and to stamp the form of<br>
administration out of the dried structure.<br>
Advantageously, the paste is processed by means of an extruder, wherein, depending on the<br>
type of the extrusion, strands or planar structures are produced, which are singulated by<br>
chopping, cutting or stamping. The singulated sub-portions may be shaped, formed or<br>
stamped as described above to produce the form of administration. Corresponding devices are<br>
known to the person skilled in the art<br>
In this regard, the method according to the invention may here be performed continuously or<br>
discontinuously.<br>
It is also possible to add solvent to the formulation mixture in such a quantity that at least the<br>
polymer component (C) is dissolved. A solution or dispersion/suspension of this kind is<br>
preferably converted into a planar structure, wherein preferably an extruder with a flat die is<br>
used or the solution is cast onto a planar support.<br>
As described above, after drying, the forms of administration can be obtained from the planar<br>
structures by stamping or calendering. It is also possible, as described above, to convert the<br>
44<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
solution into strands and to singulate these, preferably after they have been dried, and shape<br>
them to produce the form of administration.<br>
Alternatively, the solution can also be divided into portions such that, after drying, they each<br>
correspond to the mass of a unit of the form of administration, wherein with moulds which<br>
already correspond to the shape of the unit of the form of administration are preferably used<br>
for this purpose.<br>
If the solution is divided into any desired portions, after drying, the portions can optionally be<br>
combined again and be shaped to obtain the form of administration, such as, for example,<br>
packaged in a capsule or pressed to form a tablet.<br>
Preferably, the formulation mixtures combined with solvent are processed at temperatures of<br>
20°C to 40°C, wherein, apart from during drying to remove the solvent and the optionally<br>
present dispersant, no higher temperatures are used. The drying temperature must be selected<br>
below the decomposition temperature of the components. Optionally, after shaping to obtain<br>
the form of administration, further drying corresponding to the above-described drying may<br>
be performed.<br>
Combinations of individual steps of the above method variants are also possible in order to<br>
produce the form of administration according to the invention.<br>
The above-described method variants 2 and 4 comprise the extrusion of a composition<br>
comprising components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D). Preferably, extrusion is<br>
performed by means of twin-screw-extruders or planetary-gear-extruders, wherein twin-screw<br>
extruders are particularly preferred.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that extrudates exhibiting an advantageous morphology are<br>
obtainable by means of planetary-gear-extruders and twin-screw-extruders. For example, it<br>
has been found that under suitable conditions the extrudate is surrounded by a shell that may<br>
be denoted as "extrusion skin". Said extrusion skin can be regarded as a sleeve-like or tubular<br>
structure forming a circumferential section of the extrudate about its longitudinal extrusion<br>
axis so that the outer surface of said sleeve-like or tubular structure forms the closed shell of<br>
45<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
the extrudate. Usually, only the front faces of the extrudate are not covered by the extrusion<br>
skin.<br>
The extrusion skin differs in its morphology from the core of the extrudate, which it surrounds<br>
in a sleeve-like manner and is connected thereto preferably in a seamless manner. Usually, the<br>
extrusion skin is visible with the naked eye in the cross section of the extrudate, optionally by<br>
means of a microscope, since due to the different morphology of the material forming the core<br>
and that forming the extrusion skin, their optical properties also differ. It appears that due to<br>
the extrusion process, the material forming the extrusion skin is exposed to mechanical and<br>
thermal conditions differing from the conditions to which the material forming the core of the<br>
extrudate is exposed, the consequence of which is that a heterogeneous morphology of the<br>
extruded strand is obtained, with, for example, a radial symmetry when an extrusion die with<br>
circular shape is used. Hereby, the material forming the extrusion skin and the material<br>
forming the core are usually distinguished by their morphology, preferably, however, not by<br>
their composition, in particular not by the relative content of components (A), (C), optionally<br>
(B) and optionally (D).<br>
The extrusion skin usually covers the entire shell of the extrudate in the sense of a one-piece<br>
tubular sleeve, independently of the geometry chosen for the extrusion die. Therefore, the<br>
extrudate can have circular, elliptic or even other cross sections.<br>
The extrusion skin preferably has a uniform thickness. Preferably, the layer thickness of the<br>
extrusion skin is within the range from 0.1 to 4.0 mm, more preferably 0.15 to 3.5 mm, still<br>
more preferably 0.2 to 3.0 mm, most preferably 0.2 to 2.5 mm and in particular 0.2 to 2.0 mm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the sum total of the thickness of the extrusion skin over both<br>
opposing sides amounts to 0.5 to 50%, more preferably 1.0 to 40%, still more preferably 1.5<br>
to 35%, most preferably 2.0 to 30% and in particular 2.5 to 25% of the diameter of the<br>
extrudate.<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic view of extrudate (71) with a sleeve-like extrusion skin (72)<br>
entirely surrounding the core (73) about the longitudinal extrusion axis (74). The outer surface<br>
of extrusion skin (72) forms the shell (75) of the extrudate (71).<br>

It has surprisingly been found that extrudates with an extrusion skin of this kind have<br>
beneficial mechanical properties. They are particularly suitable as intermediates in the<br>
production of the forms of administration according to the invention, because they may be<br>
advantageously processed, in particular by singulating and/or shaping.<br>
If the forms of administration according to the invention are produced by means of extrusion<br>
processes in which the above-described extrudate with an extrusion skin is obtained as an<br>
intermediate, the forms of administration obtained therefrom are preferably also characterised<br>
by a particular morphology.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, those regions, which have formed the extrusion skin in the<br>
extruded intermediate, are still visible with the naked eye, optionally by means of a<br>
microscope, in the cross section of the form of administration. This is due to the fact that<br>
usually the further processing, in particular the singulating and/or shaping of the extrudate<br>
causes the different nature and thereby also the different optical properties of the material<br>
forming the extrusion skin and the material forming the core to be maintained. In the<br>
following, that region of the form of administration that has emerged from the extrusion skin<br>
in the course of further processing of the extrudate (intermediate) into the form of<br>
administration, will be referred to as the "sleeve-shaped region".<br>
Preferably, the form of administration according to the invention comprises a sleeve-shaped<br>
region and a core located therein. In this regard, the sleeve-shaped region is preferably<br>
connected to the core in a seamless manner. Preferably both the sleeve-shaped region and the<br>
core have substantially the same chemical composition, ie substantially the same relative<br>
content of components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D). In this regard, the material<br>
forming the sleeve-shaped region has a morphology differing from the material forming the<br>
core. Usually, this different morphology is also expressed in terms of different optical<br>
properties, so that the sleeve-shaped region and the core are visible with the naked eye in the<br>
cross-section of the form of administration.<br>
If the form of administration according to the invention is coated, for example with a film<br>
coating, the sleeve-shaped region is arranged between the film coating and the core.<br>
47<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
Since the extrudate containing the extrusion skin (intermediate) can be processed in different<br>
ways to obtain the form of administration according to the invention, the sleeve-shaped<br>
domain can adopt different arrangements and extensions within the form of administration<br>
according to the invention. However, common to all arrangements is the fact that the sleeve-<br>
shaped region partially covers the surface of the core, but usually not its entire surface.<br>
Preferably, two opposite surfaces of the core are not covered, or at least not fully covered by<br>
the sleeve-shaped region. In other words, preferably the sleeve-shaped region has two<br>
openings/recesses on opposing sides.<br>
The sleeve-shaped region can have a uniform layer thickness. It is also possible, however, that<br>
during the processing, the shaping (eg press-forming) of the extrudate can cause different<br>
regions of the extrusion skin to be compressed or extended to different degrees so that the<br>
layer thickness of the sleeve-shaped region within the form of administration can vary.<br>
Preferably the layer thickness of the sleeve-shaped region is within the range from 0.1 to 4.0<br>
mm, more preferably 0.15 to 3.5 mm, still more preferably 0.2 to 3.0 mm, most preferably 0.2<br>
to 2.5 mm and in particular 0.2 to 2.0 mm<br>
Figures 5A and 5B are two schematic views of preferred arrangements of the sleeve-shaped<br>
region within the form of administration according to the invention. In this regard, the forms<br>
of administration (81) comprise a sleeve-shaped region (82) partially surrounding the core<br>
(83). The opposing surfaces (84a) and (84b) of the core (83), however, are not covered by the<br>
sleeve-shaped region (82).<br>
The method for the production of the form of administration according to the invention is<br>
preferably performed continuously. Preferably, the method involves the extrusion of a<br>
homogeneous mixture of components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D). In this<br>
regard, it is particularly advantageous for the intermediate obtained, eg the strand obtained by<br>
extrusion, to have uniform properties. Particularly desirable are uniform density, uniform<br>
distribution of the active substance, uniform mechanical properties, uniform porosity, uniform<br>
surface finish, etc. Only under these circumstances can the uniformity of the pharmacological<br>
properties, such as the stability of the release profile, be ensured and the amount of rejects<br>
kept low.<br>
48<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
Preferably, the method according to the present invention may be performed in such a way<br>
that the quantity of rejects is less than 25%, more preferably less than 20%, most preferably<br>
less than 15% and in particular less than 10%, wherein the rejection criteria are the FDA<br>
standards regarding the intervariability of the content of component (A), its release profile<br>
and/or the density of the form of administration when comparing two forms of administration,<br>
preferably taken from the same batch.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the above properties may be obtained by means of twin-<br>
screw-extruders and planetary-gear-extruders, wherein twin-screw-extruders are particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
The method according to the invention preferably involves the extrusion of a mixture of<br>
components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D), preferably by means of a planetary-<br>
gear-extruder or a twin-screw-extruder. After extrusion, the extrudate is preferably singulated,<br>
shaped and optionally coated in order to obtain the final form of administration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, shaping is performed<br>
with the mixture of components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D) in plasticised<br>
state. It has surprisingly been found that the extrusion of certain polymers (C), particularly of<br>
high molecular weight polyethylene oxides, produces intermediates exhibiting a certain<br>
memory effect, ie a certain recovery capacity: if the singulated extrudates are shaped at<br>
ambient temperature, eg by press-forming, forms of administration are obtained which tend to<br>
regain their original outer shape due to storage under conditions of stress, ie they return to the<br>
shaped form they had prior to shaping.<br>
The shape of the form of administration during storage under conditions of stress, e.g. at<br>
40°C/75% RH, may also be unstable for other reasons.<br>
The memory effect significantly impairs the storage stability of the form of administration,<br>
since by regaining its outer shape, numerous properties of the form of administration are<br>
changed. The same applies to any changes to the outer shape due to other reasons.<br>
It has been found that, for example, depending on the extrusion conditions, a significant<br>
expansion of the strand may occur thereby resulting in an increase in the volume of the<br>
49<br><br>
PCT application WO 2006/082099 A<br>
extrudate, ie a decrease in its density. This expansion can be compensated by subsequently<br>
press-forming the singulated extrudate at a sufficient pressure, since, under these conditions,<br>
the expansion of the material may be reversed.<br>
If, however, the press-forming was performed at ambient temperature, the memory effect of<br>
the compressed extrudate causes it to swell and expand resulting in a significant increase in<br>
the volume of the form of administration.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that a memory effect of this kind may be suppressed if shaping<br>
of the singulated extrudate is performed at an increased temperature, ie in the plasticised state<br>
of the mixture of components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D). Preferably, the<br>
shaping is performed at a pressure of at least 1 kN, more preferably within the range from 2<br>
kN to 50 kN, eg by means of a tablet press. Preferably, shaping is performed at a temperature<br>
which is about 40°C, more preferably about 30°C and in particular about 25°C below the<br>
melting range of the mixture of components (A), (C), optionally (B) and optionally (D). The<br>
melting range of a given mixture may be determined by conventional methods, preferably by<br>
DSC (eg with a DSC model 2920 (TA Instruments, New Castle) and ultrahigh pure nitrogen<br>
as purge gas at a flow rate of 150 ml/min; approximate sample weight of 10-20 mg, sealed in<br>
nonhermetic aluminium pans; temperature gradient 10°C/min).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the outer shape of the form of administration according to the<br>
invention does not substantially change when stored for at least 12 h, preferably for at least 24<br>
h, at 40°C and 75% RH, preferably in an open container.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, when stored for at least 12 h, preferably for at least 24 h, at a<br>
temperature of 20°C below the melting range of the mixture of components (A), (C),<br>
optionally (B) and optionally (D), optionally at a temperature of 40°C and 75% RH, the<br>
volume of the form of administration according to the invention increases by not more than<br>
20% or 17.5%, more preferably not more than 15% or 12.5%, still more preferably not more<br>
than 10% or 7.5%, most preferably not more than 6.0%, 5.0% or 4.0% and in particular not<br>
more than 3.0%, 2.0% or 1.0%<br>
The form of administration according to the invention exhibits controlled release of the active<br>
ingredient. It is in this regard preferably suitable for twice daily administration to patients.<br>

The form of administration according to the invention can comprise one or more substances<br>
(A) at least partially in a further delayed-release form, wherein delayed release may be<br>
achieved by means of conventional materials and methods known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, for example by embedding the substance in a release-delaying matrix or by applying one<br>
or more release-delaying coatings. The release of the substance must, however, be controlled<br>
such that the addition of release-delaying materials does not impair the necessary hardness.<br>
Controlled release from the form of administration according to the invention is preferably<br>
achieved by embedding the substance in a matrix. The excipients acting as matrix materials<br>
control the release. Matrix materials may, for example, be hydrophilic, gel-forming materials,<br>
from which release proceeds mainly by diffusion, or hydrophobic materials, from which<br>
release proceeds mainly by diffusion from the pores in the matrix.<br>
Physiologically compatible, hydrophilic materials, which are known to the person skilled in<br>
the art, may be used as matrix materials. Polymers, particularly preferably cellulose ethers,<br>
cellulose esters and/or acrylic resins are preferably used as hydrophilic matrix materials.<br>
Ethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose, poly(meth)acrylic acid and/or the derivatives thereof, such as the<br>
salts, amides or esters thereof are quite particularly preferably used as matrix materials.<br>
Also preferred are matrix materials produced from hydrophobic materials, such as<br>
hydrophobic polymers, waxes, fats, long-chain fatty acids, fatty alcohols or corresponding<br>
esters or ethers or mixtures thereof. Mono- or diglycerides of C12-C30 fatty acids and/or<br>
C12-C30 fatty alcohols and/or waxes or mixtures thereof are particularly preferably used as<br>
hydrophobic materials<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the above-stated hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials<br>
as matrix materials.<br>
In addition, components (C) and the optionally present component (D), which serve to<br>
achieve the resistance to breaking of at least 400 N, which is necessary according to the<br>
invention, may furthermore themselves serve as additional matrix materials.<br>

If the form of administration according to the invention is intended for oral administration, it<br>
may also preferably comprise a coating that is resistant to gastric juices and dissolves as a<br>
function of the pH value of the release environment. By means of this coating, it is possible to<br>
ensure that the form of administration according to the invention passes through the stomach<br>
undissolved and the active ingredient is only released in the intestines. The coating that is<br>
resistant to gastric juices preferably dissolves at a pH value of between 5 and 7.5.<br>
Corresponding materials and methods for the delayed release of active ingredients and for the<br>
application of coatings that are resistant to gastric juices are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, for example from "Coated Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms - Fundamentals, Manufacturing<br>

measurement. To this end, the tablet (4) is held between the upper pressure plate (1) and the<br>
lower pressure plate (3) of the force application apparatus (not shown) with the assistance of<br>
two 2-part clamping devices, which are in each case firmly attached (not shown) to the upper<br>
and lower pressure plate once the spacing (5) necessary for accommodating and centring the<br>
tablet to be measured has been established. The spacing (5) may be established by moving the<br>
2-part clamping devices horizontally outwards or inwards in each case on the pressure plate<br>
on which they are mounted. The reference numbers used relate solely to Figure 6.<br>
If the form of administration according to the invention is in multiparticulate form, the<br>
resistance to breaking may alternatively be determined by means of two pressure plates, such<br>
as depicted for example in Figure 7.<br>
Figure 7 shows an upper pressure plate (10) and a lower pressure plate (11), between which<br>
the probe (12), for example a pellet, is introduced. The two pressure plates are used to apply<br>
force to the probe. The evaluation of the result of the measurement is performed in the same<br>
way as in the method described above in relation to Figure 6.<br>
The tablets deemed resistant to breaking under a specific load include not only those that have<br>
not broken but also those that may have suffered plastic deformation under the action of the<br>
force.<br>
The invention is explained below with reference to examples. These explanations are given<br>
merely by way of example and do not restrict the general concept of the invention.<br>
