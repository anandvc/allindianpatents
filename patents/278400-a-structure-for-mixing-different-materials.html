[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described more in detail hereinafter in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 are views of a structure for mixing different materials according to a first embodiment of the present invention. A spout assembly 1 is removably coupled on a container such as a beverage container.<br>
The spout assembly 1 includes a main body 10 having a lip portion 11 having an opened upper end and a lower end coupled to the container, a spouting guide member 20 inserted in the lip portion to be vertically slidable 1, and a cap 30 coupled on an upper portion of the main body 10.<br>
The spouting guide member 20 is provide at its inside with a space portion 21 in which a content such as powder is stored and at an upper-outer portion with a circumferential projection 22 that is coupled in a hook portion 31 formed on an inner surface of the cap 30 to move in the vertical direction together with the cap 30, and at a lower-outer portion with a fixing projection 24.<br>
A seal closer 23 is coupled on a lower portion of the spouting guide<br>
member 20. The spouting guide member 20 is provided at an outer surface with an air introducing portion 25 in a vertical direction.<br>
The seal closer 23 is removably coupled on the lower portion of the spouting guide member 20. However, the present invention is not limited to this case. That is, the seal closer 23 may be integrally formed on a lower end of the spouting guide member 20.<br>
In the above-described spout assembly 1 formed of synthetic resin, the lip portion 11 is formed on a side of the main body 10 and the spouting guide member 20 having the space portion 21 having a predetermined volume and formed about the lip portion 11 is coupled inside the main body 10. In the space portion 21 of the spouting guide member 20, the content such as powder is stored and the seal closer 23 is tightly coupled on the lower portion of the spouting guide member 20.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the seal closer 23 is separated by contacting a bottom of the lip portion 11 during the spouting guide member 20 is ascended, thereby allowing the content to be dropt and mixed with a content in the container.<br>
The ascending extent is limited by the fixing projection 24 formed on a lower-outer circumference of the spouting guide member 20.<br>
The spouting guide member 20 is ascended and descended by the rotational operation of the cap 30. That is, in a state where the circumferential projection 22 formed on an upper-outer circumference of the spouting guide member 20 is coupled to the hook portion 31 formed on an inner surface of the cap 30, the spouting guide member 20 is ascended and descended together with the cap 30 by a predetermined distance. Before the cap 30 is separated from the main body 10, the circumferential projection 22 is separated from the hook portion 31. As a result, as shown in FIG. 3, the cap 30 is separated from the main body 10.<br>
In a state where the cap 30 is separated from the main body 10, the spouting guide member 20 is projected upward so that the user can easily drink the content.<br>
Since the air introducing portion 25 is formed on the spouting guide member 20, the air is injected in the container while drinking, thereby making it easy for the user to easily drink the mixed content.<br>
The spout assembly 1 of this embodiment can be varied in a variety of structures. For example, the spout assembly 1 can be coupled to the neck portion of the container by a screw coupling or a one-touch coupling.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a second embodiment of the present invention, in<br>
which a main body 10 is designed to be applicable to a pouch container. A spouting guide member 12 is formed on the main body 10 and a lip portion 11 of the main body 10 functions as a neck of the container by directly coupling the spouting guide member 20 to the pouch container.<br>
A space portion 21 of the spouting guide member 20 can be varied in a variety of designs. For example, the lower portion of the space portion 21 may be widened or the lip portion 11 may be varied to be curved to a side by a folding portion.<br>
In addition, the spouting guide member 20 may be designed to be projected upward so that it can be sealed on an upper portion of the container neck.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a third embodiment of the present invention, in which a seal projection 231 is formed on a seal closer to seal a lower end of a space portion 21 so that content stored in the space portion 21 can be effectively directed into the container. A dropping space portion 232 is formed so that the content stored in the space portion 21 is dropt into the container during the lower end of a spouting guide member 20 is spaced away from the seal projection 231.<br>
If required, another space S may be formed on a lower end of the<br>
lip portion 11 and an upper portion of the seal closer 230 so that the content can be stored in the space S, thereby storing the more amount of the content.<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 shows a fourth embodiment of the present invention. An extending portion 41 extending toward an inner-lower portion of the main body 10 is formed. A plurality of punching projections 42 are formed inside the extending portion 41.

An outer hook step 104a is projected on an outer surface of the<br>
storing member 104. An inner hook step 10a on which the outer hook step 104a is hooked is formed on an inner surface of the main body 10. In this embodiment, when the movable member 105 moves upward by a screwing operation, the storing portion 104 is separated from the seal member 103 inserted in a lower portion of the storing portion 104, thereby allowing the different material to be dropt in the opening portion 102. After this, when the cap 30 is separated from the movable member 105, the mixed material in the container is exhausted through the opening portion 102 and the spout member 106.<br>
At this point, the upward movement of the movable member 105 is limited by the inner hook step 10a formed on the inner surface of the main body 10, which is hooked on the outer hook step 104a formed on the outer surface of the storing portion 104.<br>
As a plurality of air introducing portions 107 are formed on the outer surface of the spout member 106 in the longitudinal direction, outer air is introduced into the container 100 when the mixed material is exhausted.<br>
FIG. 14 shows an eleventh embodiment of the present invention. A main body 10 is provided at an upper portion with a lip portion 11 and at a lower portion with a space defining surface 110. An inner closer 112<br>
111 is installed between the main body 10 and the space defining surface 110, thereby defining a space portion 111 for storing the different material.<br>
A spouting guide member 20 is elevatably inserted in the lip portion 11. A seal member 114 is formed on a lower portion of the spouting guide member 20 to selectively seal the lower portion of the inner closer 112.<br>

The spouting guide member 20 and the inner closer 112 are communicable by an introducing hole 113 to store the different material.<br>
Accordingly, when the cap 30 moves upward, the spouting guide member 20 moves together, thereby opening a center of the inner closer by a seal portion 114 to allow the different material to be dropt into the container. In drinking, the mixed material introduced into the space portion 111 is directed to the spouting guide member 20 through the introducing hole 113.<br>
FIGS. 15 and 16 show a twelfth embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the eleventh embodiment except<br>
that an inner closer 120 is coupled inside the main body 10 together with the container, thereby providing seal.<br>
The inner closer 120 extends downward to define a space portion 121 storing a different material. The inner closer 120 is provided at a center with a dropping portion 122 in which a packing 123 is inserted in the dropping portion 122 to allow a seal surface 124 formed on a lower portion of the spouting guide member 20 to tightly contact, thereby preventing the different material from being inadvertently dropt.<br>
The spouting guide member 20 is provided at a lower portion with an introducing hole 125 allowing the mixed material to be easily exhausted out of the container.<br>
The inner closer 120 includes an upper seal portion 126 contacting a neck portion of the container and a side seal portion 127 contacting an inner surface of the neck portion.<br>
The spouting guide member 20 is provided at an outer surface with a hook step 128 being limited in its upward movement.<br>
A cap 30 is coupled to an outer surface of the lip portion 11 of the main body 10 and the spouting guide member 20 inserted in the lip portion 11 moves upward together with the cap 30 by a predetermined distance.<br>
The packing 123 is installed on the dropping portion 122 to tightly contact the seal surface 124. The packing 123 may be formed in a check valve type that is convex downward and inserted to be opened by pressure sucked through the spouting guide member 20 or by the pressure increase in the container. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 16, the packing 123 may be formed in a T-shape so that it can be inserted and fixed in the seal surface 124. When the seal surface 124 extends downward and the packing 123 is installed on an outer portion of the seal surface 124 to tightly contact the upper portion of the dropping portion 122, thereby providing a perfect seal.<br>
Accordingly, when the cap 30 moves by the screwing operation, the spouting guide member 20 moves upward, thereby the seal surface 124 is spaced away from the packing 123, thereby opening the dropping portion 122 to allow the different material to be dropt in the container. Accordingly, the content mixed with the different material in the container is exhausted through the spouting guide member 20 via the introducing hole 125 when using the content.<br>
FIGS. 17 and 18 show a thirteen embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the thirteen embodiment except<br>
that the different material is stored in the inner closer 120 and the spouting guide member 20.<br>
The spouting guide member 20 is sealed at its lower portion and is provided with a communication hole 130 communicating with the inside of the inner closer 120. A seal portion 131 extending from the spouting guide member 20 is formed inside a dropping portion 122 formed on a lower portion of the inner closer 120. A packing 132 is installed on an outer surface of the seal portion 131, thereby making it possible to store and release the different material.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18, the cap 30 is provided with an inner projection 133 closely contacting an upper-outer surface of the lip portion 11 of the main body 10.<br>
Accordingly, the seal is realized by the packing 132 installed between the dropping portion 122 of the inner closer 120 and the seal portion 131 in a state where the different material is stored in the spouting guiding member 20 and the inner closer 120. By allowing the inner projection 133 formed on the cap 30 to tightly contact the upper-outer surface of the lip portion 11, the perfect seal is realized through the cap 30.<br>
At this point, when the cap 30 coupled to the lip portion 11 of the<br>
main body 10 moves upward by a screwing operation, the spouting guide member 20 moves upward, and at the same time, the seal portion 131 and the packing 132 are separated from the dropping portion 122 of the inner closer 120. As a result, the different material in the spouting guide member 20 is exhausted into the inner closer 120 through the exhaust hole 13 and dropt into the container 100 through the dropping portion 122. The different material in the inner closer 120 is dropt through the dropping portion 122.<br>
The mixed content in the container 100 is directed into the inner closer 120 through the dropping portion 122 and further directed to the spouting guide member 20 through the exhaust hole 130 so that the user drinks the content.<br>
FIG. 19 shows a fourteen embodiment of the present invention. A cap 30 is screw-coupled to a lip portion 11 of the main body 10 attached on an exhaust portion of a pouch container 100. The spouting guide member 20 storing the different material is separately coupled in the cap 30. A seal member 141 having a dropping portion 140 is formed on a lower end of the spouting guide member 20. It is preferable that the seal member 141 is formed in a lower-inner side of the main body 10.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly, when the cap 30 moves upward by the screwing operation, the spouting guide member 20 is inserted in the seal member 141 to provide a seal.<br>
FIG. 20 shows a fifteenth embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the fourteen embodiment except that a plurality of guide steps 150 formed in a lower-inner portion of the main body 10. A seal member 151 attached on an opened lower end of the spouting guide member 20 is coupled on the guide steps 150.<br>
Accordingly, when the spouting guide member 20 moves upward by the upward operation of the cap 30, the seal member 151 coupled on a lower portion of the spouting guide member 20 and supported by the guide steps 150 is separated and dropt. By this, the lower portion of the spouting guide member 20 is opened so that the different material can be dropt in the container 100.<br>
FIGS. 21 and 22 show a sixteenth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 21, a sealing plate 160 is horizontally attached on a lower end of the spouting guide member 20. The sealing plate 160 is provided with a hook portion 161 extending outward.<br>
The a plurality of sealing plate removing portion 162 are formed on<br>
an inner-lower portion of the main body 10.<br>
It is not limited that the sealing plate 160 is horizontally formed. For example, as shown in FIG. 22, it can be inclined in a direction.<br>
Accordingly, when a cap 30 moves upward to move a spouting guide member 20 upward, the seal plate 160 is separated by the seal plate removing portion 162 to open an lower portion of the spouting guide member 20, thereby allowing the different material to be dropt in the container.<br>
When the seal plate 160 is inclined, it can be more easily separated from the spouting guide member 20. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
