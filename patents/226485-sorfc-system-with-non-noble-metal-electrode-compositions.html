				<td>A SOLID OXIDE REGENERATIVE FUEL CELL AND<br>
METHOD OF OPERATION THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention is generally directed to a solid oxide<br>
regenerative fuel cell and method of operation thereof and more specifically to<br>
reversible fuel cells and their operation.<br>
[0002]	Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which can convert energy stored<br>
in fuels to electrical energy with high efficiencies. There are classes of fuel cells that<br>
also allow reversed operation, such that oxidized fuel can be reduced back to<br>
unoxidized fuel using electrical energy as an input.<br>
[0003]	One type of reversible or regenerative fuel cell is the solid oxide<br>
regenerative fuel cell (SORFC) which generates electrical energy and reactant product<br>
from fuel and oxidizer in a fuel cell or discharge mode and which generates the fuel<br>
and oxidant from the reactant product and the electrical energy in an electrolysis or<br>
charge mode. The SORFC contains a ceramic electrolyte, a positive or oxygen<br>
electrode and a negative or fuel electrode. The electrolyte may be yttria stabilized<br>
zirconia ("YSZ") or doped ceria. The positive electrode is exposed to an oxidizer,<br>
such as air, in the fuel cell mode and to a generated oxidant, such as oxygen gas, in<br>
the electrolysis mode. The positive electrode may be made of a ceramic material,<br>
such as lanthanum strontium manganite ("LSM") having a formula (La,Sr)MnO3 or<br>
lanthanum strontium cobaltite (LSCo) having a formula (La,Sr)CoO3. The negative<br>
electrode is exposed to a fuel, such as hydrogen gas, in a fuel cell mode and to water<br>
vapor (i.e., reactant product) in the electrolysis mode. Since the negative electrode is<br>
exposed to water vapor, it is made entirely of a noble metal or contains a large amount<br>
of noble metal which does not oxidize when exposed to water vapor. For example,<br>
the negative electrode may be made of platinum.<br>
[0004]	However, the noble metals are expensive and increase the cost of the<br>
fuel cell. In contrast, the prior art acknowledges that the negative electrodes cannot<br>
be made from a non-noble metal in a SORFC because such electrodes are oxidized by<br>
the water vapor in the electrolysis mode. For example, an article by K. Eguchi et al.<br>
in Solid State Ionics 86-88 (1996) 1245-1249 states on page 1246 that a cell with Ni-<br><br>
YSZ electrodes is not suitable for a solid oxide electrolyzer cell. The article further<br>
states on page 1247 that that a high concentration of steam (i.e., water vapor) caused<br>
the deterioration of a Ni-YSZ electrode and that a noble or precious metal negative<br>
electrode is preferred.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	One preferred aspect of the present invention provides a solid oxide<br>
regenerative fuel cell, comprising a ceramic electrolyte, a first electrode which is<br>
adapted to be positively biased when the fuel cell operates in a fuel cell mode and in<br>
an electrolysis mode, and a second electrode which is adapted to be negatively biased<br>
when the fuel cell operates in the fuel cell mode and in the electrolysis mode. The<br>
second electrode comprises less than 1 mg/cm2 of noble metal.<br>
[0006]	Another preferred aspect of the present invention provides a method of<br>
operating a solid oxide regenerative fuel cell, comprising operating the solid oxide<br>
regenerative fuel cell in a fuel cell mode by providing a fuel to a negative electrode<br>
and providing an oxidizer to a positive electrode to generate electricity and water<br>
vapor at the negative electrode. The method further comprises operating the solid<br>
oxide regenerative fuel cell in an electrolysis mode by providing electricity to the fuel<br>
cell and providing water vapor to the negative electrode to generate fuel at the<br>
negative electrode and oxygen at the positive electrode. The method further<br>
comprises providing a sufficient reducing atmosphere to the negative electrode when<br>
the solid oxide regenerative fuel cell operates in the electrolysis mode to prevent the<br>
negative electrode from oxidizing. The negative electrode comprises less than 1<br>
mg/cm2 of noble metal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012]	The present inventors have realized that SORFC negative (i.e., fuel)<br>
electrode may contain no noble metals or a small amount of noble metals, such as<br>
less than 1 mg/cm2 of noble metal, if a sufficient reducing atmosphere is provided to<br>
the negative electrode when the fuel cell operates in the electrolysis mode to prevent<br>
the negative electrode from oxidizing. The use of cheaper and/or more common<br>
conductive materials in the negative electrode reduces the cost of the SORFC and<br>
improves operational performance.<br>
[0013]	As used herein, the term noble metal includes gold, iridium, palladium,<br>
platinum, rhodium, osmium and silver. These metals are also known as precious<br>
metals. Preferably, the negative electrode contains less than 20 weight percent of<br>
noble metal. More preferably, the negative electrode contains less than 0.1 mg/cm2 of<br>
noble metal and less than 1 weight percent of noble metal. Most preferably, the<br>
negative electrode contains no noble metal or an unavoidable trace impurity amount<br>
of noble metal. Furthermore, it is preferred that the positive electrode also contains<br>
no noble metal or an unavoidable trace impurity amount of noble metal.<br>
[0014]	As used herein, the term SORFC (i.e., solid oxide regenerative fuel<br>
cell) includes a ceramic electrolyte, a positive or oxygen electrode which is adapted to<br>
be positively biased when the fuel cell operates in a fuel cell mode and in an<br>
electrolysis mode, and a negative or fuel electrode which is adapted to be negatively<br>
biased when the fuel cell operates in the fuel cell mode and in the electrolysis mode.<br>
Oxygen ions are conducted, through the ceramic electrolyte from the positive<br><br>
electrode to the negative electrode when the fuel cell operates in the fuel cell mode<br>
and from the negative electrode to the positive electrode when the fuel cell operates in<br>
the electrolysis mode.<br>
[0015]	Any suitable materials may be used for the electrolyte and the<br>
electrodes. For example, the negative electrode may comprise a non-noble metal,<br>
such as at least one of Ni, Cu, Fe or a combination thereof with an ionic conducting<br>
phase (i.e., a cermet). In one preferred aspect of the invention, the negative electrode<br>
consists essentially of a Ni-YSZ cermet (i.e., a nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia<br>
cermet). Any suitable weight ratio of nickel to YSZ may be used in the electrode,<br>
such as a ratio of 30:70 to 95:5, preferably 65:35. The electrolyte may comprise any<br>
suitable ceramic, such as YSZ and/or doped ceria.<br>
[0016]	In another preferred aspect of the invention, the negative electrode<br>
consists essentially of a Ni-doped ceria cermet. Any suitable weight ratio of nickel to<br>
doped ceria may be used in the electrode, such as a ratio of 30:70 to 95:5, preferably<br>
65:35. In this case, the electrolyte preferably comprises a doped ceria electrolyte or a<br>
combination electrolyte having a doped ceria portion or layer in contact with the<br>
negative electrode and a YSZ portion in contact with the positive electrode. The ceria<br>
may be doped with any suitable dopant, such as a Sc dopant or a rare earth dopant<br>
selected from Gd and Sm, in an amount sufficient to render the ceria to be ionically<br>
conducting.<br>
[0017]	The positive electrode may comprise any suitable material. Preferably,<br>
the positive electrode comprises a conductive perovskite ceramic material selected<br>
from LSM, LSCo, LCo, LSF, LSCoF, PSM or a combination thereof with an ionic<br>
conducting phase. Lanthanum strontium manganite ("LSM") preferably has a<br>
formula (Lax,Sr1-x) MnO3 where x ranges from 0.6 to 0.99, preferably from 0.8 to<br>
0.85. Lanthanum strontium cobaltite ("LSCo") preferably has a formula<br>
(Lax,Sr1-x)CoO3 where x ranges from 0.6 to 0.99, preferably 0.8 to 0.85. If x is equal<br>
to one, then the electrode material comprises LCo. Lanthanum strontium ferrite<br>
("LSF") preferably has a formula (Lax Sr1-x)FeO3 where x ranges from 0.4 to 0.99,<br>
preferably from 0.6 to 0.7. Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite ("LSCoF") preferably<br><br>
has a formula (Lax,Sr1-x)(Fey,Co1-y)O3 where x ranges from 0.4 to 0.99, preferably<br>
from 0.6 to 0.7 and y ranges from 0.01 to 0.99, preferably from 0.7 to 0.8.<br>
Praseodymium Strontium Manganite ("PSM") preferably has a formula<br>
(Prx,Sr1-x)MnO3 where x ranges from 0.6 to 0.99, preferably from 0.8 to 0.85. The<br>
perovskite electrode materials may optionally be admixed with the electrode<br>
ceramics, such as YSZ and doped ceria, such as GDC (gadolinium doped ceria).<br>
Other suitable pervoskite electrode materials may also be used.<br>
[0018]	As used herein, "a sufficient reducing atmosphere to prevent the<br>
negative electrode from oxidizing" comprises any suitable reducing gas which when<br>
mixed with water vapor provided to the negative electrode during electrolysis mode<br>
prevents the negative electrode from oxidizing to an extent which prevents it from<br>
operating according to its designed parameters during its expected life span, such as<br>
for at least one month, preferably at least one year, such as one to ten years, for<br>
example. Preferably, hydrogen is used as the reducing gas. However, other gases,<br>
such as forming gas (a nitrogen/hydrogen mixture) and carbon monoxide may also be<br>
used alone or in combination with hydrogen. The maximum ratio of water vapor to<br>
reducing gas provided to the negative electrode during the electrolysis mode depends<br>
on the material of the negative electrode and on the type of reducing gas used. Some<br>
negative electrode materials require more reducing gas to prevent oxidation that other<br>
negative electrode materials. For example, if a hydrogen reducing gas is used for a<br>
Ni-YSZ electrode, then the water to hydrogen ratio is preferably 8 or less, for example<br>
0.1 to 8, such as 0.4 to 5 or 0.44 to 1. However, the water to hydrogen ratio may be<br>
different than the ratio provided above depending on various factors, such as the<br>
electrode composition, the overall gas composition provided to the negative electrode<br>
and other factors, while still preventing the negative electrode from oxidizing to an<br>
extent which prevents it from operating according to its designed parameters during<br>
its expected life span. Preferably, the reducing atmosphere (i.e., the reducing gas)<br>
does not chemically participate in the electrolysis process and is cycled through the<br>
fuel cell without being consumed.<br><br>
[0019]	Figure 1 illustrates a SORFC system 1 operating in the electrolysis or<br>
charge mode. The system 1 contains a schematically illustrated SORFC 10. While<br>
only a single SORFC 10 is shown, it should be understood that the system 1<br>
preferably contains a stack of SORFCs, containing a plurality of electrolytes, positive<br>
electrodes and negative electrodes. The system 1 also contains a fuel storage vessel<br>
101, such as a hydrogen tank, an optional fuel compressor 103, a water-hydrogen<br>
separator / water storage device 105, a water pump 107, an oxidizer blower 109, a fuel<br>
bleed valve 111 and optional water, oxidizer and compressor valves 113, 115 and 117,<br>
respectively. The system 1 also contains heat exchangers 119 and 121 which preheat<br>
the inlet streams into the fuel cell 10 using the fuel cell exhaust streams. The system<br>
further contains fuel and oxidizer conduits, such as pipes, hoses or other suitable gas<br>
and liquid conduits, which connect the above mentioned components together.<br>
[0020]	The system contains a reducing gas conduit 123 which provides a<br>
sufficient reducing atmosphere to the negative electrode of the fuel cell 10 when the<br>
fuel cell operates in the electrolysis mode to prevent the negative electrode from<br>
oxidizing. Preferably, the reducing gas 123 conduit also comprises a fuel conduit<br>
which is used to provide fuel to the negative electrode during the fuel cell or<br>
discharge mode. Thus, the reducing gas in the electrolysis mode preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, comprises the same gas as the fuel which is used in the fuel cell mode. In<br>
the electrolysis mode, the bleed valve 111 located in the reducing gas conduit is<br>
partially opened to provide a smaller amount of fuel/reducing gas to the fuel cell than<br>
in the fuel cell mode.<br>
[0021]	Preferably, the reducing gas/fuel comprises hydrogen and the reducing<br>
gas conduit 123 comprises a hydrogen conduit operatively connected to at least one of<br>
a hydrogen compressor 103 and the hydrogen fuel storage vessel 101. The term<br>
operatively connected means that the conduit 123 may be directly or indirectly<br>
connected to the compressor 103 and/or vessel 101 to allow hydrogen to flow from<br>
the compressor 103 and/or vessel 101 through the conduit 123 into the fuel cell. The<br>
conduit 123 is operatively connected to the fuel inlet of a fuel cell 10 (i.e., to the inlet<br>
of the fuel cell stack).<br><br>
[0022]	The water-hydrogen separator 105 is also operatively connected to the<br>
fuel inlet of the fuel cell via the water inlet conduit 125. The separator 105 provides<br>
water to the negative electrode of the fuel cell 10 when the fuel cell 10 operates in the<br>
electrolysis mode. Preferably, the conduits 123 and 125 converge at the three way<br>
valve 113, and inlet conduit 127 provides the water and reducing gas from valve 113<br>
to the negative electrode of the fuel cell 10.<br>
[0023]	A fuel outlet of the fuel cell 10 is operatively connected to a water-<br>
hydrogen separator 105 via a fuel exhaust conduit 129. Conduit 129 removes water<br>
from the negative electrode when the fuel cell operates in the fuel cell mode. An<br>
oxygen exhaust conduit 131 removes oxygen generated at the positive electrode when<br>
the fuel cell operates in the electrolysis mode. An oxidizer inlet conduit 133 provides<br>
an oxidizer, such as air or oxygen, to the positive electrode of the fuel cell 10 when<br>
the fuel cell operates in the fuel cell mode. In the electrolysis mode, the conduit 133<br>
is closed by valve 115.<br>
[0024]	Figure 2 illustrates the SORFC system 1 operating in the fuel cell or<br>
discharge mode. The system 1 is the same, except that the bleed valve 111 is opened<br>
to a greater amount than in the electrolysis mode, the oxidizer valve 115 is open<br>
instead of closed and the water valve 113 either totally or partially closes the water<br>
conduit 125.<br>
[0025]	A method of operating the solid oxide regenerative fuel cell system 1<br>
will now be described. In the fuel cell mode shown in Figure 2, a fuel, such as<br>
hydrogen, carbon monoxide and/or a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane, is provided<br>
to the negative electrode of the fuel cell 10 from storage vessel 101 through conduits<br>
123 and 127. The fuel is preheated in the heat exchanger 119. If desired, some water<br>
from the separator/storage device 105 is provided via conduits 125 and 127 to the<br>
negative electrode of the fuel cell as well. Alternatively, the water may be provided<br>
from a water pipe rather than from storage.<br>
[0026]	An oxidizer, such as oxygen or air is provided to the positive electrode<br>
of the fuel cell 10 through conduit 133. This generates electricity (i.e., electrical<br><br>
energy) and water vapor at the negative electrode. The unused oxidizer is discharged<br>
through conduit 131. The water vapor reactant product along with unused fuel, such<br>
as hydrogen, and other gases, such as carbon monoxide, are discharged from the fuel<br>
cell through conduit 129 into the separator 105. The hydrogen is separated from<br>
water in the separator and is provided into the compressor 103 through conduit 135.<br>
The compressor 103 cycles the hydrogen back into the fuel cell 10.<br>
[0027]	In the electrolysis mode shown in Figure 1, electricity is provided to<br>
the fuel cell. Water vapor is provided to the negative electrode of the fuel cell 10<br>
from the separator/storage device 105 or from a water pipe through conduits 125 and<br>
127. A sufficient reducing atmosphere, such as hydrogen gas, is also provided to the<br>
negative electrode through conduits 123 and 127. For example, at start-up of the<br>
SORFC operation, when the compressor 103 does not usually run, the hydrogen may<br>
be provided from the storage vessel 101. Subsequently, when the compressor 103<br>
becomes operational at steady state, it provides hydrogen to the conduit 123 and to the<br>
storage vessel 101.<br>
[0028]	This generates fuel, such as hydrogen, at the negative electrode, and<br>
oxygen at the positive electrode of the fuel cell. The hydrogen, including the<br>
hydrogen generated in the electrolysis of water vapor reaction and the hydrogen<br>
provided from conduit 123 along with remaining unreacted water vapor are provided<br>
from the fuel cell 10 through conduit 129 to the separator 105. The water-hydrogen<br>
separator 105 separates the hydrogen from water, with the water being either stored or<br>
discharged. The separated hydrogen is provided to the compressor 103 through<br>
conduit 135. The compressor provides a first portion of the compressed hydrogen to<br>
the hydrogen storage vessel 101 and provides a second portion of the compressed<br>
hydrogen to the negative electrode of the fuel cell 10 through conduit 125 to maintain<br>
the sufficient reducing atmosphere at the negative electrode. The oxygen generated<br>
during the electrolysis reaction is discharged through conduit 131.<br>
[0029]	Preferably, the fuel cell 10 is cycled between the fuel cell mode and the<br>
electrolysis mode at least 30 times, such as 30 to 3,000 times. During the cycles,<br>
when the fuel cell operates in the electrolysis mode, the bleed valve 111 bleeds a first<br><br><br>
sufficient amount of hydrogen from at least one of the hydrogen compressor and the<br>
hydrogen fuel storage vessel through the hydrogen conduit 123 to the negative<br>
electrode of the fuel cell to prevent the negative electrode from oxidizing. Providing<br>
a reducing atmosphere on the negative electrode during the electrolysis mode allows<br>
the use of non-noble materials in the electrode which also maintains compatibility for<br>
the electrolysis operation.<br>
[0030]	When the fuel cell operates in the fuel cell mode, the bleed valve<br>
provides hydrogen fuel from, the hydrogen storage vessel through the hydrogen<br>
conduit 123 to the negative electrode in a second amount greater than the first<br>
amount. In other words, the first amount of reducing gas should be a small amount of<br>
reducing gas, but sufficient to prevent oxidation of the negative electrode.<br>
[0031]	It should be noted that the hydrogen conduit 123 provides a sufficient<br>
amount of reducing gas to the plurality of negative electrodes of a fuel cell stack to<br>
prevent all negative electrodes of the stack from oxidizing. Therefore the negative<br>
electrodes of the SORFC stack are maintained in a reducing atmosphere, preventing<br>
oxidation of the electrode materials at elevated temperatures in the range 600-1000°C.<br>
[0032]	In alternative embodiments of the present invention, separate storage<br>
vessels are used to store fuel and the reducing gas. Preferably, this occurs when the<br>
fuel and reducing gas comprise different gases. For example, the fuel may comprise a<br>
hydrocarbon fuel rather than hydrogen, or forming gas or carbon monoxide is used as<br>
a reducing gas. In this case, a separate reducing gas storage vessel, such as a<br>
hydrogen, carbon monoxide or forming gas storage tank or pipe may be used to<br>
provide the reducing gas into the fuel cell 10 in the electrolysis mode, while the fuel<br>
storage vessel 101 is used to provide fuel into the fuel cell in the fuel cell mode.<br>
[0033]	A single SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode is shown in<br>
Figure 3. The SORFC contains an anode (positive) electrode 11, an electrolyte 13 and<br>
a cathode (negative) electrode 12. An anode gas chamber 14 is formed between the<br>
electrolyte 13 and an anode side interconnect (not shown for simplicity). A cathode<br><br>
gas chamber 15 is formed between the electrolyte 13 and a cathode side interconnect<br>
(also not shown for simplicity).<br>
[0034]	A reaction product gas mixture 17 may contain primarily water with<br>
reducing gas, such as hydrogen. Alternatively, the reaction product gas mixture 17<br>
may contain primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide if a carbon containing gas or<br>
liquid, such as methane, is used as a fuel. Hydrogen, carbon monoxide or forming gas<br>
is also added to the gas mixture as the reducing gas.<br>
[0035]	The reaction product gas mixture 17 is introduced into the cathode gas<br>
chamber 15. A direct current power source (not shown) is connected to the anode<br>
electrode 11 and the cathode electrode 12 in such a way that when electrical current is<br>
flowing, the anode electrode 11 takes on a positive voltage charge and the cathode<br>
electrode 12 takes on a negative voltage charge. When the electric current is flowing,<br>
the gas mixture 17 gives up oxygen ions 16 to form cathode discharge mixture 19<br>
consisting primarily of hydrogen and optionally carbon monoxide if mixture 17<br>
contained carbon dioxide. Oxygen ions 16 transport across the electrolyte 13 under<br>
the electrical current. The oxygen ions 16 are converted into the oxidant, such as<br>
oxygen gas 18 on the anode electrode 11 under the influence of the electrical current.<br>
The oxygen gas 18 is discharged from the anode chamber 14, while the electrolysis<br>
product (e.g., hydrogen and optionally carbon monoxide) is collected from the<br>
cathode chamber. If carbon monoxide is present in the product, then the product may<br>
be converted to methane fuel and water in a Sabatier reactor.<br>
[0036]	A single SORFC 20 operating in the fuel cell mode is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
SORFC 20 is the same as SORFC 10, except that the cathode and anode designations<br>
of its electrodes are reversed. Cathode (positive) electrode 21 is the same electrode as<br>
that identified as the anode (positive) electrode 11 in Fig. 3 when operating in the<br>
electrolysis mode. Anode (negative) electrode 22 is the same electrode as that<br>
identified as the cathode (negative) electrode 12 in Fig. 3 when operating in the<br>
electrolysis mode. Solid oxide electrolyte 23 is the same electrolyte as that identified<br>
as electrolyte 13 in Fig. 4 when operating in the electrolysis mode. Cathode gas<br>
chamber 24 is the same gas chamber as that identified as the "anode gas chamber 14 in<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 when operating in the electrolysis mode. Anode gas chamber 25 is the same<br>
gas chamber as that identified as the cathode gas chamber 15 in Fig. 3 when operating<br>
in the electrolysis mode.<br>
[0037]	A fuel gas 27 is introduced into the anode gas chamber 25. An<br>
oxidizer, such as air or oxygen gas 28 is introduced into the cathode chamber 24. The<br>
fuel may comprise hydrogen, a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane, and/or carbon<br>
monoxide. Water may be added to the fuel if desired. An electrical fuel cell load (not<br>
shown) is applied to the SORFC 20 and the oxygen gas 28 forms oxygen ions 26<br>
under the influence of the electrical load. Oxygen ions 26 transport across the<br>
electrolyte 23 under the influence of the electrical current. On the anode electrode 22,<br>
the oxygen ions 26 combine with hydrogen and optionally carbon, if present, from gas<br>
mixture 27 to form gas mixture 29 containing water vapor and optionally carbon<br>
dioxide, if a carbon containing gas is present in the fuel 27. Gas mixture 29 is<br>
discharged from the anode chamber and stored as the reaction product. In the process<br>
described above, the SORFC 20 has made electrical energy or power, which is output<br>
through its electrodes.<br>
[0038]	The SORFC systems described herein may have other embodiments<br>
and configurations, as desired. Other components, such as fuel side exhaust stream<br>
condensers, heat exchangers, heat-driven heat pumps, turbines, additional gas<br>
separation devices, hydrogen separators which separate hydrogen from the fuel<br>
exhaust and provide hydrogen for external use, fuel preprocessing subsystems, fuel<br>
reformers, water-gas shift reactors, and Sabatier reactors which form methane from<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide, may be added if desired, as described, for example,<br>

[0039]	The following specific example is provided for illustration only and<br>
should not be considered limiting on the scope of the present invention. Figure 5<br>
illustrates the plot of cell potential and power density versus current density for a<br><br><br>
single 10 cm2 SORFC cell using a test bed that models the inlet gas streams as<br>
described with respect to Figures 1 and 2 above. The SORFC cell contains the<br>
following components. The negative or fuel electrode is a Ni-YSZ cermet electrode<br>
containing 65 weight percent Ni and 35 weight percent YSZ. This electrode is 27<br>
microns thick and is made by screen printing on the electrolyte and being fired to<br>
1350°C. The electrolyte is a YSZ electrolyte that is 300 microns thick. The<br>
electrolyte is tape cast and fired to 1550°C. The positive or oxygen electrode is an<br>
LSM electrode that is 39 microns thick. This electrode is made by screen printing on<br>
the electrolyte and firing to 1200°C.<br>
[0040]	The negative electrode is fed with a constant 300 seem of H2 passing<br>
through a humidifier at a set temperature. The charge (i.e., electrolysis) mode is run<br>
with the humidifier set to 70°C or 30.75% H2O. This provides an H2O to H2 ratio of<br>
0.44 to the negative electrode. One discharge (i.e., fuel cell) mode is run with the<br>
humidifier set to 70°C or 30.75% H2O, while another discharge (i.e., fuel cell) mode<br>
is run with the humidifier set to 29°C or 3.95% H2O. The H2O to H2 ratio is 0.44 and<br>
0.04, respectively, for the respective discharge mode runs. Table 1 below lists the<br>
negative electrode conditions for the various modes of operation with ambient<br>
pressure reactants.<br><br>
[0041]	As shown in Figure 5, this fuel cell with a negative electrode which<br>
contains no noble metal is successfully operated in both charge and discharge modes<br>
and exhibits acceptable current-voltage and current-power characteristics for<br>
reversible operation.<br><br>
