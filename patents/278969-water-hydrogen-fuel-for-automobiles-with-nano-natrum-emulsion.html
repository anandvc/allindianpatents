TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Aerohydrosol &amp; Natronitrosol Hydrogen Fuel for Automobiles.<br>
Introduction;<br>
For cheaper production of electricity all nations are opting nuclear reactors .It is hazardous and problematic. But my invention proposes, cheaper production of electricity and when proper precautions are taken its harmful effects can be reduced.<br>
As such I can call my invention Sodium Chemo reactor for multipurpose benefits. On 9th Jan, 2008 Professor &amp;Director Mr.P.Nejat Vezirogulu for Clean Research Ins, University of Miami U.S. after perusing my inventory project expressed his heart felt appreciation saying that it is a very important invention that is to be patented immediately.<br>
All the while human industrial pride went bound on the back of fossile fuel resources like coal, Petroleum and Natural gas resources. If we consume them at the present rate, we have to run short of the above said fuel resources in no time, resulting in an energy crisis. It is a blessing in disguise indeed in a sportive sense. All the fossil fuels contain small amounts of Sulphur and Nitrogen and when they are burnt in<br>
Industries and automobiles, Carbon dust, Carbondioxide, Carbonmonoxide, Sulphur dioxide, Sulphur trioxidc and oxides of Nitrogen results in, in air atmosphere, reducing the green house effect. Global warming and Acid rains are the alarming factors, which appear on account of them. They bring in unhygienic human calamity and distress. Therefore this is high time for us that we should seek alternative renewable sources of energy on a war footing.<br>
Among the many renewable resources, the role-play of Hydrogen fuel draws the attention of the scientists and industry. It is the best fuel to meet the needs of the day and the Energy Crisis. This alone is a deserving substitute to replace the fossil fuels on the face of the earth and it is the best fuel for India.<br>
Though Hydrogen is a dangerous gaseous fuel, this invention makes it less serious and more useful. Hydenberg calamity reminds of its lethal effect. Hydrogen fuel needs high order containers with safety valves and sensors, when it is preserved and used as a fuel.<br>
Advantages of this invention:<br>
1. It is my own indigenous project. It is unique and ever contemplated by anybody.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
water and Air are not harmful materials. If Natronitrolol spray alone occurs it reacts with water vapour residues in the cylinder and piston vicinity brings in working stroke.<br>
5.The Natrum Hydroxide formed during the liberation of Hydrogen by the vigorous chemical reaction of Natrum and water is a solid. When it dissolves in water or water vapour, it becomes soapy and reduces friction between lines and piston. But corrodes all metals on account of its caustic reaction. If fibreglass lamination is done to cylinder and piston corroding effect is eliminated. The byproducts formed are Natrum Oxide or Natrumhydroxide. In the presence of CO2 NatrumCarbonate is formed. They are not harmful and they are not pollutants. In solution form or emulsion form it can be , collected, preserved and sold. It may be recycled to get back Natrum Nitrosol or it may be used for hard soap, papermaking, Petroleum refining, artificial silk making and in some other manufacturing activities. We can also sell NaoH and get back Natrum nitrosol.<br>
6.Fossile fuels burn and produce working stroke to the automobiles. But they liberate   pollutants, smoke and Carbon ash. Except energy liberation no byproduct is obtained. Every time purchase of fossils fuel touches our packet. It is not so with my Natrumnitrosol.lt gives 80% resale value to the consumer from its exhaust material.<br>
6.	Water recycle, Nitrogen recycle, Oxygen recycle from photosynthesis of plants, Carbondioxide recycle, day and night recycle, recycle of seasons in a year, birth and death of plants and animals etc... keep the nature and to world as it is without running short of the resources required. Such a recycle of Natrum metal is offered in this project .The question of extinction of any requirements- water, air, natrum metal and nitrogen gas will not happen. Therefore my invention becomes a renewable resource. The question of extinction of any of the requirement. Water, Air, Natrum metal, and Nitrogen gas from the air will not happen. Even if the total world begins to consume the above said resources for centuries together nothing happens to the percentage composition of air atmosphere and of oceanic salt-water composition. Thus my invention hits upon the renewable resources and makes the world dynamic by its recycle effect. <br>
8.When automobiles work with the hydrogen fuel it does not contemplate for perfectly dry condition of Hydrogen. Both when combine in a dry condition Hydrogen will not burn in dry air or in dry oxygen. Burning of Hydrogen takes place only when there is a moist atmosphere. As such we can say that moisture is a catalytic agent for Hydrogen combustion. <br>
9.Hydrogen burns as per the following balanced equation <br>
2H2+O2®2H2O+572KJ/mol <br>
As such l mol of Hydrogen offers 286KJ/molof combustion Heat. This is six times greater than that of diesel of petrol nearly. As the modern technology offers very good coolants to control the heat generated, we can over come the above said problem by choosing an appropriate coolant.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
I believe that the higher enthalpy of Hydrogen is a blessing disguise for us. The coolant in the nuclear reactor helps to generate steam for thermal electricity. In a similar way the coolant in this invention extracts the heat of Hydrogen combustion. If this heat is transferred to water,steam is generated. Steam turbines thermal electricity. Thus we get electricity in two methods for a single effort.<br>
10.	Every city,town, and village can have there own Hydrogen engines to produce two types of electrical productions in an independent way. In such case the establishment for power transmission and power grids does not arise. Every town and village gets surplus current at cheaper rates.<br>
11.	On account these benefit the agricultural production expenditure is brought down to<br>
minimum. There will be no energy crisis and food crisis in India.<br>
12.Thus my invention removes energy crisis and food crisis in no time and installs green house effect and global cooling with pollution free world. Similar to water cycle, Nitrogen cycle Sodium oriented Hydrogen fuel cycle becomes a God given gift to the total world for its unending human ethical, culture and economical, peaceful progress as long as sun, moon and stars shine in the blue sky over the world.<br>
Emphatic declaration:<br>
My nascent Hydrogen fuel engine is of multipurpose benefits. If my stationary engine is installed at Hydal electric power station, it produces 1 .Hydrogen fuel electricity 2.Thermal electricity in addition to the Hydal electricity. Thus the electrical production rate will be thrice increased.  <br>
Disadvantages:<br>
1. Major disadvantage is corroding effect of NaoH produced on the cylinder and piston of the engine. This is solved in a simple way by laminating the internal parts of the engine cylinder and the external parts of the piston with heat resistance fiberglass material.<br>
How usually an internal combustion engine works:<br>
In a single stroke engine, the cylinder and piston are arranged as shown in the diagram. The piston moves up and down in the cylinder freely with airtight mechanism. The base of the piston is attached to the connecting rod. The cylinder is closed with a metal head. It is air tight in nature. It is provided with intake pipe for the automizer and another air intake cum exhaust pipe.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The internal combustion engine makes use of the explosive energy released in the burning of diesel fuel to generate motive power.<br>
As the piston moves down fuel from automizer nozzle and air from intake and exhaust pipe is drawn into cylinder. The mixture is compresed as the piston rises up.<br>
3w "the vertical diesel engine there is no spark plug. The temperature produced by compression creates ignition (200-600°c). Fuel and air mixture explodes and brings in working stroke.<br>
The piston goes down by working stroke. It comes up again pushes out all hot and waste gases and smoke. In this way suction, compression,working and exhaust strokes happen one after another and bring in rotatory motion to the engine.<br>
Very few alterations are wanted at the head region of the vertical engine-<br>
With respect to the cylinder, piston with rings at the bottom of the engine no changes are required. But as a special case, the coolant jacket should be bigger to accommodate more of<br>
Coolant flow<br>
 <br>
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS; (F^CTT^ «f U AU*j*. YH-^V) -<br>
1 .water and air are mixed (Hydro aerosol) in appropriate proportions and sprayed in to the cylinder.<br>
2.Natronitrosol spray cylinder is another important requirement wanted. Sodium (Natrum) is an alkali metal. It is available in abundance in seawater. As we get Sodium back by recycling, my engine makes Sodium a renewable source. As I need Sodium in nano particular condition in a gaseous medium with emulsification effect, Nitrogen gas becomes the best medium. It is chemically inert. To obtain nano particles of Sodium metal, thermal metal spray process is to be adapted.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Preparation of thermal metal spray;<br>
Sodium metal melts and boils at 900°c. As shown in the diagram it is taken in a closed crucible and heated. Pressurized Nitrogen gas is passed over the crucible. Nitrogen gas takes the vapour particles of Sodium with it and becomes a suspension medium. This suspension under pressure is collected in another cylinder for use. This is called Natro nitrosol.<br>
CHEMICAL REACTION;<br>
Hydro Aerosol provides water in molar quantities for the chemical reaction. In a similar way Sodium nano particles are released from Natrumnitrosol cylinder. For such injection the oil pumping arrangement seen in the regular engine is utilized.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The nano particles of NaoH with air and Nitrogen gas mixture comes out from the exhaust valves. NaoH is preserved and recycled. The heavy heat generated is utilized for thermal electricity. Therefore in my invention the air proportion is preserved. Sodium metal is made a renewable source. Electricity is produced by mechanical means and thermal means. Therefore it is twice blessed. In addition to all these benefits we are putting an end to pollution and generating green house effect. When there is surplus of electricity every where there will be surplus of food and surplus of industrial development and all the benefits of science are enjoyed by one and all of the total world.<br>
Therefore as an inventor I proudly announce that my Hydrogen Fuel Engine<br>
