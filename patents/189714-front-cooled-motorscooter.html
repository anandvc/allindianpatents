				<td>FRONT COOLED MOTORSCOOTERâ€”<br>
This invention relates to a front cooled motorscooter.<br>
Water-cooled motorscooter engines encounter certain problems in<br>
the optimum location of the heat exchanger element, given the<br>
particular structure of the motorscooter frame.<br>
In this respect, its location can involve related problems of<br>
motorscooter wear and noise, without forgetting the aesthetic<br>
problems deriving therefrom.<br>
These problems are further increased when a heat exchanger element<br>
or more simply a radiator is to be positioned in a motorscooter<br>
having an open frame with a load-bearing body.<br>
The aforesaid applies equally to motorscooters provided with a<br>
two-stroke or with a four-stroke water-cooled engine.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a motorscooter<br>
allowing optimum and simple location of the heat exchanger element<br>
or radiator used for cooling, both for a two-stroke and for a<br>
four-stroke engine.<br>
A further object is to identify a radiator position resulting in<br>
minimum vehicle noise and wear, while achieving totally sufficient<br>
engine cooling.<br>
These objects are attained according to the present invention by a<br>
front cooled motorscooter of the type comprising a load-bearing frame provided at its front with an apron and able to rearwardly house an engine with relative transmission towards a rear drive wheel, characterized by providing on said frame, in a front region thereof, a heat exchanger element connected to said engine by pipes and through which a cooling fluid circulates.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for a front cooled motorscooter of the type comprising a load-bearing frame (11) provided at its front with an apron (10) and able to rearwardly house an engine (13) with relative transmission towards a rear drive wheel (14), characterized by providing on said frame (11), in a front region thereof, a heat exchanger element (16), positioned on said front apron on the outer side or on inner side of said load-bearing frame (11) and connected to said engine (13) by pipes (18) and through which a cooling fluid circulates.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The characteristics and advantages of a motorscooter according to the present invention will be more apparent from the description thereof given hereinafter by way of non-limiting example with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a perspective view of a motorscooter according to the present invention provided with a radiator in the carrier compartment, partly cut away for greater clarity; Figure 2 is a perspective view, again partly cut away, of a further motorscooter application according to the invention with the radiator positioned on the inner side of the front apron; and Figure 3 is a perspective view, again partly cut away, of yet a further motorscooter application according to the invention with the radiator positioned on the outer side of the front apron. The figures show a schematic example of a front cooled motorscooter according to the invention.<br>
A motorscooter of this type has an open frame 11 with a load-bearing body, of characteristic omega shape, which enables the driver to remain normally seated.  The front part of the frame 11 is provided upper ly with a steering head 12 in correspcnder.ee wit: an apron 10.  The rear part of the frame 11 houses an engine 13 with relative transmission towards a rear drive wheel 14 located<br>
below a seat 15.<br>
A heat exchanger element 16, such as a radiator, is located in a<br>
front region of the frame 11 to feed cooling liquid to the engine<br>
13.<br>
The heat exchanger element 16 is provided with a filling cap 17<br>
and top-up port plus inlet and outlet pipes 18 for connection to<br>
the engine 13.  The heat exchanger element 16 is of small<br>
dimensions and can be of usual configuration.<br>
In the illustrated preferred locations it can be seen that both in<br>
Figure 1 and in Figure 2 the heat exchanger element 16 is<br>
positioned within the frame 11 on the inner wall of the front<br>
apron 1C.<br>
In the first example shown in Figure 1 , the motorscooter according<br>
to the present invention is provided with a radiator 16 located<br>
within a carrier compartment 20.  The carrier compartment 20 is<br>
either rigidly fixed to or formed integrally with the front apron<br>
10 of the frame 11.<br>
If the carrier compartment 20 comprises two pockets, the radiator<br>
can be housed in one of them and may comprise an upper flat cover<br>
wall 21.  If the radiator 16 is located directly in the carrier<br>
compartment and fixed to it, then when this latter is assembled<br>
the radiator is advantageously assembled at the same time so that<br>
it remains only to be connected to the pipes and to the circuit.<br>
The heat exchanger element 16 can be aligned with a series of<br>
slots 19 forming a grille (best seen in Figure 2) through the<br>
front apron 10 to also allow the entire heat exchanger body to be<br>
directly cooled by moving air.  Further slots 22 can be provided<br>
in a side wall of the carrier compartment 20 to allow the air to pass, with consequent cooling.<br>
In the example of Figure 2 the heat exchanger element 16 is located free on the inside of the apron 10, but may be protected by a guard, not shown.  Slots 19 can also be provided in this case, as already described.<br>
In both cases the pipes 18 pass within the interior of the frame 11 so that they are protected against the surroundings and at the same time cannot be seen on the motorscooter. The further example of Figure 3 shows how the heat exchanger element 16 can be located even more simply on the outer front of the apron 10 with the pipes 18 entering into the frame through an aperture 23 of suitable size provided in the apron 10. The presence of such a heat exchanger element enables front cooling of the engine to be achieved, for example deriving both from traditional finning and from the hence circulating cooling liquid.<br>
The width of the open frame of characteristic omega shape would even allow a tube bundle arrangement to be distributed over non-load bearing parts of the body, to achieve further improved cooling of easy operation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
