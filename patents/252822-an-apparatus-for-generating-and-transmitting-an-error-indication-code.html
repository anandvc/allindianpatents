				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for generating and transmitting an error detection code.<br>
Background Art<br>
Typically, radio communication systems for transferring packet data use physical channels, such as, Packet Data Channel (hereinafter referred to as PDCH), Packet Data Control Channel (hereinafter referred to as PDCCH) and so forth.<br>
The PDCH is a channel for use of transferring packet data that actually needs to be transferred to a relevant terminal, mobile station or user (hereinafter being used interchangeably). Many users prefer the PDCH based on the Time Division Multiplexing system (hereinafter referred to as TDM system). The PDCCH contains control information, enabling a terminal to receive the data being transferred through the PDCH without error.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a control message format and a number of information bits transmitted through PDCCH according to a related art for a TDM system. The ARQ (automatic request) channel identifier and subpacket identifier are binary information bits informing the terminal of whether information including PDCH corresponding to PDCCH is to be retransmitted or not. The encoder packet size is<br>
binary information bits informing a data information bit number transmitted on PDCH. The MAC identifier is a terminal identifier, and values except (000000): indicate that control information of PDCCH is transferred to which terminal.<br>
When a base station transfers packet data using TDM system, or schedules data and later sending the data to each terminal in sequence, the packet data, which is transmitted to every terminal, always uses all of the available resources, e.g., Walsh codes, in the PDCH. Even when only a part of the available resources needs to be used, all of the resources are still used for the packet data. As a result thereof, most of other resources are wasted at the same time.<br>
For example, data sent on PDCH need to be coded and decoded based on Walsh codes. Serial bits arc converted to parallel, and the parallel bits are coded using the Walsh codes. In order to decode the data, the information regarding the Walsh codes is sent on the PDCCH.<br>
In TDM system, there are plurality of time intervals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc, and only one of a plurality of terminals is allotted for each time interval where a PDCH and PDCCH are sent to the terminal during this allotted time interval. For example, if there are users 1 and 3 and time intervals 1 and 3, respectively, and if all 32-ary Walsh codes are available for use by terminal 1, all 32-ary Walsh codes are utilized in the PDCH during time interval 1. However, if the available Walsh codes decrease in time interval 3, all decreased Walsh codes are utilized for the PDCH. Even before terminal 3 can use the changed/decreased Walsh codes in time interval 3, it needs to know this information. In order to acln-ve this, the BS broadcasts such information using a Walsh  Code  Space  Identification  Identifier  (WSI)  field  in  the PDCCH<br>
(without PDCH) with MAC_ID field information bit of (000000)2 before time interval 3 to all terminals within a cell.<br>
And , the base station explicitly transmits a control message including MAC_ID to the terminals on PDCCH.<br>
A base stadon regularly or irregularly broadcasts WSI on die PDCCH without the PDCH to all terminals under its management. In the course of the broadcast, the base stadon uses every possible power for all terminals (even including terminals in the worst environment) to be able to receive the information such that even the terminals in the worst environment can receive the WSI. Hence, the broadcasting consumes much power. Moreover, when the WSI change, the base station has to inform the changes to all terminals every time. In those cases, the base station cannot transmit PDCH, so the transmission efficiency of the entire system is consequendy reduced.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Prior to the description of the present invention, parameters used in the<br>
present invention are explained as follows.<br>
Walsh code is a common name of codes having orthogonality to each other<br>
and used for transmitting physical channels.<br>
Walsh code space is a set of Walsh codes available for the current use when a base station transmits packet data, and elements thereof vary in accordance with time.<br>
PDC1 l(i) means ith PDCH if at least two PDCHs are available for use. In this case, each of PDCHs divides to use Walsh codes in Walsh code space.<br>
PDCCH(i), if it is possible for at least two PDCHs to exist, is a common name of a physical channel including control information that a base station transmits to terminals in order to receive PDCH(i) successfully.<br>
The present invention related to a packet data transmission system of a TDM/CDM system, whereby a plurality of PDCHs and PDCCHs exist. Hence, expressions of PDCH(i) and PDCCH(i) are used in the following description. In other words, when PDCCH(l), PDCCH(2),..., PDCCH(N) and PDCH(l), PDCH(2),...,.PDCH(N) exists, PDCCH(i) indicates PDCCH that the base station transmits to the terminal to receive PDCH(i) successfully.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the format of the Packet Data Control Channel (PDCCH) Message in accordance with the preferred embodiment (described hereinafter), over the PDCCH, e.g., forward PDCCH (F-PDCCH). The message format of the PDCCH includes an additional field called Walsh Code Allocation (WCA) field (e.g., CDM Walsh space Identification (CWSI) field/ (Last Wnlsli Code. Index (LWSI) field), which preferably prevents wasted power consumption caused by broadcasting, and eliminates such broadcast. Even if broadcasting is used, the additional field of WCA field reduces the inefficiencies of a prescribed system. The description of the fields illustrated in Figure 2 and the various implementation of the WCA field can be<br>
found in co-pending U.S. Application Serial No., 10/259,292 filed September 30, 2002, whose entire disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
This message format can be used in both a TDM system, i.e., one PDCH physical channel and one PDCCH physical channel within a prescribed rime interval and uses the available Walsh codes, and a Code Division Multiplex (CDM) system, i.e., a plurality of PDCH(i) physical channels and a plurality of PDCCH(i) physical channels, where i is an integer number that is greater than or equal to 0 , within a prescribed period of time and the plurality of users are assigned to a plurality of physical channels by allocadon of the Walsh codes within the Walsh code space.<br>
In comparing the fields (EP.SIZE, ACID, SPID, MACJD, and WCA) of Figure 1 (EP_SIZE, ACID, SPID, and MACJD) and Figure 2 (EP_SIZE, ACID, SPID, MAC_ID, and WCA), the number of informadon bits has increased from 13 bits to 20 bits. With the addition of the WCA field, the number of bits for the PDCCH in TDM/CDM mode increased, resulting in more power consumption. Hence, there is a need to decrease the number of information bits of the PDCCH fields.<br>
Three following approaches may be used for reducing the number of information bits of the PDCCI I:<br>
Method 1 is to use explicit 8 bits MAC_ID and add 8 bits CRC (cyclic redundancy check code), which is a class of linear error detecting codes which generate parity check bits by finding the remainder of a polynomial division, for error detection.<br>
Method 2 is to mask the 16 bits CRC with the implicit user MAC_ID and not to transmit the MAC_ID.<br>
Method 3 is to use a 'double CRC, wherein a first CRC is masked by 8 bit implicit MAC_ID and a second CRC is added with the first CRC and the MAC_ID is not transmitted.<br>
The advantage of method 1 is that the maximum number of blind decodings of the forward PDCCH (F-PDCCH) is limited to 4, while method 2 requires a maximum of 6 blind decodings of F-PDCCH. Therefore, method 1 may be a preferred solution in terms of mobile complexity. The advantage of method 2 is that the UDER (UnDetected Error Ratio) performance is better than method 1 due to the increased CRC length.<br>
Method 3 is a hybrid of method 1 and method 2. if two PPCCHs are supported by a system and the PDCCHs have three types of transmission format, Method 3 will provide approximately the same UDER performance as method 2, while maintaining the same level of mobile station complexity. Since the complexity of method 1 and method 3 is similar, it is reasonable to choose a method that provides better performance. Hence, the preferred embodiment of the present invendon utilizes method 3 for reducing the number of bits of the PDCCH.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, which uses the third method, Figure 3 illustrates the message format of iPDCCH when the number of bits of WALSH_MASK, EXT_MSG_TYPE and RESERVED fields equals 0 (see copending U.S. Application Serial No. 10/259,292).  As shown therein, the number of<br>
bits of the PDCCH is decreased to 13 bits, even with die additional sequence number field bits.<br>
The PDCCH frame structure is shown in Figure 4 including the encoder tail bits of 8 bits. Further, the number of bits can be further reduced by decreasing the number of bits of the second CRC to be less than 8 bits, e.g., 4 bits, depending upon the system requirements. In order to generate the PDCCH frame structure, the following steps are used:<br>
Step 1: First CRC bits are calculated based on the 13 input bits of the<br>
scrambled PDCCH and masked by the implicit 'MAC_ID'; and<br>
Step 2: Second CRC bits are calculated based on the 13 input bits and<br>
the first CRC bits generated in step 1.<br>
Step 3: Encoder Tail bits are added.<br>
Depending upon the terminology used, the first CRC may be referred to as the outer CRC and the second CRC may be referred to as the inner CRC. Alternatively, the first CRC may be referred to as the inner CRC and the second CRC may be referred to as the outer CRC depending upon the terminology used. For convenience, the former will be used hereinafter in this preferred embodiment. Figure 5A illustrates a general block diagram of a transmission chain structure of PDCCH in accordance with a preferred embodiment. Referring to Figure 5A, an input sequence of PDCCH, as shown in Figure 3, includes an ARQ channel identifier field of 2 bits, an encoder packet size field of 3 bits, and a subpacket identifier field of 2 bits, WCA field of 5 bits and optional sequence number field of 1 bit. An error<br>
detection code such as a CRC (cyclic redundancy check code) is added to the input sequence in an error detection code addition block 101.<br>
Tail bits for sending a final state of a trellis termination ar.e added to an output sequence of the error detection code addition block 101 in a tail bit addition block 102. The sequence to which the tail bits are added are encoded as a convolution code in an encoder 103. After the outputted sequence having been encoded, it is repeated in a symbol repetition block 104. The repeated bits are punctured in a puncturing block 105 and thereafter, is interleaved in a block intcrleavcr 106, and then modulated in a QPSK modulator 107.<br>
Figure 5B illustrates a detailed PDCCH transmission chain structure in accordance with a preferred embodiment of die present invention. In this case, the base station preferably transmit on the Forward Packet Data Control Channel at prescribed variable data rates, e.g., of 29600, 14800, and 7400 bps, depending on the frame duration. The frame duration is preferably NUM_SLOTS (NUM_SLOTS = 1, 2, or 4) 1.25-ms slots. All Packet Data Control Channels and Packet Data Channels transmitted simultaneously preferably start their transmissions at the same time (SYS_TIME) and have the same durations.<br>
For a given base station, the I and Q pilot PN sequences for the Forward Packet Data Control Channel preferably use the same pilot PN sequence offset as for the Forward Pilot Channel. The modulation symbols transmitted on the first Forward Packet Data Control Channel (PDCCH _ID = '0') should preferably be transmitted using at least as much energy as the modulation symbols transmitted on the second Forward Packet Data Control Channel (PDCCH_ID = '1') that is being<br>
transmitted simultaneously, Nmax_PDCH is 2. See co-pending Application Serial No.TO/259,292.<br>
The information transmitted on the Forward Packet Data Control Channel preferably comprises scrambled SDU[12:0] and the frame quality indicator-covered SDU[20:13], where SDU (Service Data Unit) is a parameter passed by the MAC Layer. The Forward Packet Data Control Channel frame preferably comprises scrambled SDU[12:0], the 8-bit frame quality indicator-covered SDU[20:13], the 8-bit inner frame quality indicator (CRC), and the eight Encoder Tail Bits.<br>
First CRC generator 201A and Second CRC generator 201B: The 8-bit frame quality indicator-covered SDU[20:13J (first CRC) is generated by performing the modulo-2 addition of the SDU[20:13] (MAC_ID) passed by the MAC Layer, with an outer frame quality indicator, which is calculated on the scrambled SDU[12:0]. Second CRC generator 201B: The inner frame quality indicator (second CRC) is calculated on all bits within the frame, except the inner frame quality indicator itself and the encoder tail bits.<br>
The tail bit generator (202) generates the last eight bits of each Forward<br>
Packet Data Control Channel frame are called the Encoder Tail Bits. Preferably, each<br>
of the eight bits is set to '0'. The encoder (203) convolutionally encodes as the<br>
PDCCH frame.   Preferably, the encoder is initialized to the all-zero state at the end<br>
of each frame.  The encoded PDCCH frame undergoes code symbol repetition (204)<br>
and the code symbols resulting from the symbol repetition are punctured (205).  The<br>
modulation symbols on the PDCCH are then interleaved, and the interleaver block<br>
(206) is aligned with the PDCCH frame.<br>
The modulation symbol is provided to the signal point mapping block 20 (e.g., modulator) for transmission.. Figure 6A illustrates details of the first (outer) CRC generator 201A of Figure 5. The 8-bit frame quality indicator-covered SDU[20:13] (first CRC) is generated by performing the modulo-2 addidon of the SDU[20:13] (MAC_ID) passed by the MAC Layer widi an outer frame qualm-indicator, which is calculated on die scrambled SDU[12:0j. The generator polynomial for the outer frame quality indicator is based on g(x) = x8 + x2 + x + l.<br>
Initially, all shift register elements 201a0-201a7 is preferably set to a logical one and the switches are preferably set in the up posidon. The register are clocked once for each of the first 13 scrambled input bits of the Forward Packet Data Control Channel frame with those bits as input. Then, the switches are set in the down position so that the output is a modulo-2 addition with the 8-bit SDU[20:13] and the successive shift register inputs are '0's. Each register is clocked an additional eight times. These additional bits form the frame quality indicator-covered SDU[20:13] field, i.e., the outer CRC, which are transmitted in the order calculated as output.<br>
Figure 6B illustrates the details of the second (inner) CRC generator 201B illustrated in Figure 5. The inner frame quality indicator (CRC) is generated based on all bits within the frame, except the inner frame quality indicator itself and the Encoder Tail Bits. The Forward Packet Data Control Channel preferably uses an 8-bit frame quality indicator. The generator polynomial for the inner frame quality indicator is preferably based on g(x) = x8 + x7 + x4 + x3 + x + l.<br>
Herein, the inner frame quality indicator and the outer frame quality indicator may be generated by different polynomials, respectively.<br>
Initially, if the frame duration of the Forward Packet Data Control Channel is 1.25 or 2.5 ms, all shift register elements 201b0-201b7 are preferably initialized to logical one and the switches are preferably set in the up position. If the frame duration of the Forward Packet Data Control Channel is 5 ms, all shift register elements are preferably initialized to logical zero and the switches are preferably set in the up position. Each register is clocked once for each of the first 21 bits of the Forward Packet Data Control Channel frame with those bits as input. The switches are set in the down position so that the output is a modulo-2 addition with a '0' and the successive shift register inputs are '0's. The register is clocked an additional eight times. These additional bits shall be the inner frame quality indicator bits, which are transmitted in the order calculated as ourpur.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a block diagram of an error detection code addition block of Figure 5A in accordance with another preferred embodiment. In Figure 7, the error detection code addition block is called a MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator and an error detection code generated from the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator is called a MACID/WCA-CRC code, where WCA is e.g., CWSI or LWCI. The symbol "/" is generally interpreted as "and" or "or." If "/" is interpreted as an "or," either the MAC_ID or WCA can be used. If "/" is interpreted as an "and," both MACJD and WCA arc used. Referring to Figure 7, an error detection code added to PDCCH(i) according to this preferred embodiment of the present invention, e.g. a MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code, is generated using the input sequence of PDCCH(i)<br>
input sequence with WCAQ and or MAC identifier (i) (MAC_11)Q). Selectively, the MACJD/WCA-CRC code can be generated using the PDCCH(i) sequence and WCAQ of another control channel PDCCHQ. In this case, WCAQ means WCA transmitted on PDCCHQ, where ij and preferably j = i - 1 when i &gt; 1. The MAC identifier(i) is allocated to a terminal or user which is to receive the information on PDCCH(i).<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a more detailed block diagram ol the eiror detection code addition block illustrated in Figure 7 in accordance with this preferred embodiment. A MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator 201 according to the present invention includes a CRC generator 301 generating a general CRC code and a modulo operator 303.<br>
In this instance, the CRC generator 301 uses PDCCH(i) input sequence (EP_SIZE, ACID, SPID, WCAQ and AI_SN) of x bits and WCA(j) as inputs so as to generate a CRC code having a general M-bits length. The CRC generator 102 is a common name of the CRC generator constituted with transition registers.<br>
The modulo operator 303 carries out a modulo-2 operation (e.g., exclusive OR operation) on the general CRC code of M-bits length and an MAC identifier(i) of S-bits length so as to generate a MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code of M bits. In this case, if S<m die remaining bits are padded with or in front rear of the mac identifier and modulo-2 operation is then carried out.></m>
In Fig. 8, WCAQ and MAC_ID(i) are selectively used to generate the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code. That is, MACJD/WCA-CRC generator uses both or either of diem.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a more detailed block diagram of the error detection code<br>
addition   block   illustrated   in   Figure   7   in   accordance   with   another   preferred<br>
embodiment.      Referring   to   Figure   9,   a   CRC   generator .401   included   in   a<br>
MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator initializes values of its transition registers using the<br>
MAC_ID(i).   If a length of the MAC identifier(i) is shorter than that for initializing<br>
the values of the transition registers of the CRC generator 401, '0's or Ts amounting<br>
to the necessary number are padded in front or rear of the MAC identifier(i) and a<br>
modulo 2 operation is carried out.    The CRC generator 401 having the initialized<br>
transition registers based on MAC_ID(i) uses an PDCCH(i) input sequence of x-bits<br>
number and WCAQ of PDCCHQ so as to generate a MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) code<br>
having an M-bit length. In Fig.9, WCAQ and MAC_ID(i) are alternatively used to<br>
generate the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code. That is, MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator<br>
uses both or either of them.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a diagram of an output result of each of the error<br>
detection code addition blocks of Figures 8 and 9.    The MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i)<br>
code is added to the PDDCH(i) input sequence for input to the tail bit addition block<br>
102   of  Figure   5A.      As   can   be   appreciated,   the   arrangement   order   of   the<br>
MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) code and PDCCHQ input sequence can be reversed. The<br>
MAC identifier(i) is used for generating MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) and need not be<br>
transmitted separately to a receiving end when WCAQ is not used ("/" - or).<br>
Likewise, when the MAC identifier(i) and WCAQ are both used ("/" = and), these<br>
parameters need not be transmitted separately to the receiving end.    Instead, the<br>
MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i)   and   PDCCH(i)   input  sequence   are   transmitted   to   the receiving end.<br>
If only the MAC_ID(i) is used for generating the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code, (i.e., without WCA(j), there arc no special considerations/facror that need to be taken into account. However, if the WCAQ is used with or without MAC_ID(j) by the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator, the following operational factors should be considered.<br>
First Operational Consideration When N number of PDCH(i)s and N number of PDCCH(i)s are used, a terminal should recognize MAC identifier(i) and WCAQ in order to receive PDCCHQ. Hence, in order to receive PDCCHQ, PDCCHQ needs to be correctly received in order to interpret WCAQ. If the interpretation of WCAQ is wrong or incorrect, the terminal is unable to receive PDCCHQ correctly.<br>
Second Operational Consideration<br>
In the first operational consideration, assuming that j is (i-1), a terminal should recognize MAC identifier(i) and WCA (i-1) in order to receive the PDCCHQ. In order to receive the PDCCHQ, PDCCHQ1) needs to be correcdy received in order to interpret WCA (i-1). However, a value of WCA(O) should be determined previously, e.g., WCA (0) = (00000)2. Figure 11 illustrates a more detailed block diagram of the error detection code addition block of Figure 7 in accordance with another preferred embodiment. Referring to Figure 11, a MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator 201 according to the present invention includes a CRC generator 501 generating a general CRC code and a modulo operator 502. The CRC generator 501<br>
uses PDCCH(i) input sequence of x-bits to generate a general CRC code of M-bit length. The modulo operator 502 carries out modulo operation on the general CRC code and {MAC identifier(i) of S bits + WCA(j) of Y bits}/where i=j, so as to generate MACJD/WCA-CRCQ of M bits. If (S+Y)<m or ts are padded in front rear of the sequence comprising idenrifier wcaq prior to modulo operation being carried out. fig. and mac_id selectively used generate code. that is generator uses both either them.></m>
Figure 12 illustrates a more block diagram of the error detection code addition block in Figure 7 in accordance with another preferred embodiment. Referring to Figure 12, a CRC generator 601 included in a MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator 201 initializes values of its transition registers using {MAC identifierQ + WCAQ}, where ij. The CRC generator 601 having the inidalized transidon registers uses the PDCCHQ input sequence of x-bit length as an input so as to generate MAC_ID/WCA-CRCQ of M-bits length. If a length of the {MAC identifierQ + WCAQ, ij} is shorter than that for initializing the values of the transition registers of the CRC generator 601, '0's or '1's amounting to the necessary number are padded in front or rear of the sequence constituted with the {MAC identifierQ + WCAQ, i j} and initialization is then carried out.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates a detailed block diagram of the error detection code addition block of Figure 5A in accordance with another preferred embodiment. The error detection code addition block serves as an overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator 703  to generate an overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code.    The overlap<br>
MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator 703 includes a MACJD/WCA-CRC generator 701 and a CRC generator 702. The CRC generator 702 includes transition registers. The MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator 701 may comprise any one of the preferred embodiments shown in Figures 8, 9, 11 and 12.<br>
The MACJD/WCA-CRC generator 701 uses the PDCCH(i) input sequence of x-bits, including WCAQ of Y-bits and a MAC idendfier(i) of S-bits from its inputs so as to generate MAC_TD/WCA-CRC(i) of M-bits. The MAC identifier® is allocated to a terminal or a user intended to receive the information on the PDCCH(i).<br>
The CRC generator 702 uses PDCCH(i), and MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) sequence to generate CRC(i) of P bits. The generated CRC(i) and MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) are connected to each other to generate the overlap MACJD/WCA-CRCQ , which is in inputted to a following stage in the transmission chain structure of Figure 5A or Figure 5B.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates a diagram of an output result of the error detection code addition block of Figure 13. The arrangement order of the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) and PDCCH(i) input sequence can be reversed. Since, the MAC idenrifier(i) and WCAQ are used for generating MACJD/WCA-CRCQ, these fields need not be transmitted to a receiving end, and the overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) and PDCCH(i) sequence are transmitted to the receiving end. If the WCAQ is not used, this embodiment is quite similar or the same as the embodiment of the double CRC.<br>
First Operational Consideration of Figure 13<br>
When N number of PDCI l(i)s and N number of PDCCH(i)s fire used,  <br>
terminal judges whether PDDCH(i) is received normally or not through a series of the following processes using the overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i).<br>
The terminal checks CRC(i) in ihc overlap MAC._ID/WCA-CRC(i) to judge whether PDDCH(i) is received correctly or not. If a transmission length of PDCCH(i) is variable, the terminal recognizes the transmission length of PDCCH(i) by checking the CRC(i). Having determined that the PDDCH(i) is correcdy received, the terminal judges whether PDCCH(i) is its control channel or not using the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) in the overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) as well as judging again as to whether PDCCH(i) is correctly received.<br>
In this case, in order 10 check the MAC_ID/WCA CRC(i), the Terminal needs to know the MAC idendfier(i) independendy or both the MAC idenrifier(i) and WCA(j). In case that the terminal needs to know both the MAC identifier(i) and WCA(j), PDCCH(j) needs to be correcdy received so that WCA(j) can be interpreted in order to receive PDCCH(i). If the interpretation of WCAQ is wrong, an error will be detected when MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) is checked.<br>
Second Operational Consideration of Figure 13<br>
If one or more PDCCH(i)'s arc simultaneously transmitted, the PDCCH(i)'s transmitted simultaneously have the same transmission length, and a specific PDCCH(k) and the rest of the PDCCH(i)s (except the specific PDCCH(k)) can have the overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i)s of different structures, respectively.<br>
Assuming that the specific PDCCH(k) is PDCCH(l), the process goes as follows. The PDDCH(l) generates the overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(1) through the<br>
same process of Figure  13, and the terminal checks as to whether an error of PDDCH(l) has occurred or not through the first operadonal consideradon.<br>
The PDCCH(i)s, except PDCCH(l) excludes the generation process of CRC(i) of Figure 13, and an overlap MAC_ID/WCA-CRC(i) of L bits is generated by the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC generator. The terminal checks whether errors of the PDCCH(i)s have occurred or not through the first operational consideration. Hence, the check for CRC(i) is not carried out.<br>
Third Operational Consideration of Figure 13<br>
In the first and second operational considerations, assuming that j is (i-1), a terminal should recognize MAC identifier(i) and WCA(i-l) in order to receive PDCCH(i). In order to receive PDCCH(i), PDCCH(j-l) needs to be correcdy received so that WCA(i-l) can be correcdy interpreted. Hence, a value of WCA(O) needs to be previously determined. For example, it may be that WCA(O) = (00000):-<br>
Accordingly, the preferred embodiment enables operation in CDM/TDM mode, thereby reducing waste of available sources. Moreover, the present invention uses double CRC or the MAC_ID/WCA-CRC code, thereby reducing the number of bits of the PDCCH and improving the error detection capability of PDCCH(i).<br>
