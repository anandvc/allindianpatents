Background of the invemion This invemion is directed to the use of iriaryl acid derivatives and their pharmaceutical compositions as PPAR ligand receptor binders. The PPAR ligand receptor binders of this invention are useful as agonists or antagonists of the PPAR receptor.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) can be subdivided into three subtypes, namely: PPARct, PPAR5, and PPARy. These are encoded by different genes (Motojima, Cell Structure and Function, 18:267-277, 1993). Moreover, 2 isoforms of PPARy also exist, PPARyi and yj . These 2 proteins differ in their NH; -lerminal-30 amino acids and are the result of alternative promoter usage and differential mRNA splicing (Vidal-Puig, Jimenez, Linan, Lowell, Hamann, Hu, Spiegelman, Flier, Moller, J. Clin. Invest., 97:2553-2561, 1996).<br>
Biological processes modulated by PPAR are those modulated by receptors, or receptor combinations, which are responsive to the PPAR receptor Itgands described herein. These processes include, for example, plasma lipid transport and fatty acid catabolism, regulation of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels, which are involved in hypoglycemia/hyperinsulinism (resulting from, for example, abnormal pancreatic beta cell function, insulin secreting tumors and /or autoimmune hypoglycemia due to autoantibodies to insulin, the insulin receptor, or autoantibodies that are stimulatory to pancreatic beta cells), macrophage differentiation which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, inflammatory response, carcinogenesis, hyperplasia or adipocyte differentiation.<br>
Obesity is an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. Recent work in this area indicates that PPARy plays a central role in the adipocyte gene expression and differentiation. Excess adipose tissue is associated with the development of serious medical conditions, for example, non-insulin-dependent diabetes melIitus(NIDDM), hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia and certain malignancies. The adipocyte may also influence glucose homeostasis through the production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and other molecules.<br>
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or Type 11 diabetes, is the more common form of diabetes, with 90-95% of hyperglycemic patients experiencing this form of the disease. In NIDDM there appears to be a reduction in the pancreatic g-cell mass, several distinct defects in insulin secretion or a decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin. The symptoms of this form of diabetes include fatigue, frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, frequent infections and slow healing of sores, diabetic nerve damage and renal disease.<br><br>
Resistance to ihe metabolic actions of insulin is one of the key features of non-insulin dependent diabeies (NIDDM). Insulin resistance is characterised by impaired uptake and utilization of eiucose in insulin-sensitive target organs, for example, adipocytes and skeletal muscle, and by impaired inhibition of hepatic glucose output. The functional insulin deficiency and the failure of insulin to supress hepatic" glucose output results in fasting hyperglycemia. Pancreatic P-cells compensate for the insulin resistance by secreting increased levels of insulin. However, the |3-celis are unable to maintain this high output of insulin, and, eventually, the glucose-induced insulin secretion falls, leading to the deterioration of glucose homeostasis and to the subsequent development of overt diabetes.<br>
Hyperinsulinemia is also linked to insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridaemia and increased plasma concentration of low density lipoproteins. The association of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia with these metabolic disorders has been temied "Syndrome X'^ and has been strongly linked to an increased risk of hypertension and coronary artery disease.<br>
Metformin is known in the art to be used in the treatment of diabetes in humans (US Patent No. 3,174,901). Metformin acts primarily to decrease liver glucose production. Troglitazone® is known to work primarily on enhancmg the ability of ^cletal muscle to respond to insulin and take up glucose, h is knovm that combination therapy comprising metfonnin and troglitazone can be used in the treatment of abnoimalities associated with diabetes (DDT 3:79-88, 1998).<br>
PPAR Y activators, in particular Troglitazone®, have been found to convert cancerous tissue to normal cells in liposareoma, a tumor of fat (PN AS 96:3951-3956,1999). Furthermore, it has been suggested that PPAR y activators may be usefiil in the treatment of breast and colon cancer (PNAS 95-.8806-88U, 1998, Nature Medicine4:1046-10S2,1998).<br>
Moreover, PPARy activators, for example Troglitazone®, have been implicated in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). This is a syndrome in women that is characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Women with this syndrome often have insulin resistance and an increased risk for the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes melHtus. (Dunaif, Scott, Finegood, Quintana, Whitcomb, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 81:3299, 1996.<br>
Furthermore, PPARy activators have recently been discovered to increase the production of progesterone and inhibit steroidogenesis in granulosa cell cultures and therefore may be usefiil in the treatment of climacteric. (United States Patent 5,814,647 Urban et al. September 29, 1998; B. Lohrke et al. Journal of Edocrinology, 159,429-39, 1998). Climacteric is defined as the syndrome of endocrine, somatic and psychological changes occurring at the termination of the reproductive period in the female.<br>
Peroxisomes arc cellular organelles which play a role in controlling the redox potential and oxidative stress of cells by metabolizing a variet}' of substrates such as hydrogen peroxide. There are a number of disorders associated with oxidative stress. For example, inflammatory response to tissue injury, palhoeenesis of emphysema, ischemia-associated organ injury (shock), doxorubicin-induced<br><br>
cardiac injury, drug-induced hepaiotoxicity, atherosclerosis, and hyperoxic lung injuries, are each associated with the production of reactive oxygen species and a change in the reductive capacity of the ceil. Therefore, it is envisaged that PPARa activators, among other things, regulate the redox potential and oxidative stress in cel-is, would be effective in the treatment of these disorders (Poynter et al, J. Biol Chem. 273,32833-41, 1998).<br>
It has also been discovered that PPARa agonists inhibit NFKB-mediated transcription thereby modulating various inflammatory responses such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyciooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme pathways (Pineda-Torra, 1. T al, 1999, Curr. Opinion in LipidoJogy, 10,151-9 ) and thus can be used in the therapeutic intervention of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases and other pathologies (Colville-Nash, et ai.. Journal of Immunology, 161, 978-84, 1998; Staels et al. Nature. 393, 790-3, 1998).<br>
Peroxisome proliferators activate PPAR , which in turn, acts as a transcription factor, and causes differentiation, cell growth and proliferation of peroxisomes. PPAR activators are also thought to play a role in hyperplasia and carcinogenesis as well as altering the enzymatic capability of animal cells, such as rodent cells, but these PPAR activators appear to have minimal negative effects in human ceils (Green, Biochem. Pharm. 43(3):393, 1992). Activation of PPAR results in the rapid increase of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and catalase.<br>
PPARa is activated by a number of medium and long-chain fatty acids and is involved in stimulating ^-oxidation of fatty acids in tissues such as liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue (Isseman and Green, supra; Beck et al., Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 247:83-87, 1992; Gottlicher et al^ Proc. 'Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4653-4657,1992). Pharmacological PPARa aaivators, for example fenofibrate, clofibrate, genfibrozil, and bezafjbrate, are also involved in substantial reduction in plasma triglycerides along with moderate reduction in LDU cholesterol, and they are used particularly for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia and obesity. PPARa is also known to be involved in inflammatory disorders. (Schoonjans, K., Cuirent Opionion in Lipidology, 8, 159-66,1997).<br>
The human nuclear receptor PPAR6 has been cloned from a human osteosarcoma ceil cDNA library and is fully described in A. Schmidt et al.. Molecular Endocrinology, 6:1634-1641 (1992), the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. It should be noted that PPAR5 is also referred to in the literature as PPARp and as NUC1, and each of these names refers to the same rector. For example, in A. Schmidt et al.. Molecular Endocrinology, 6: pp. 1634-1641, 1992, the receptor is referred to as NUC1. PPAR5 is observed in both embryo and adult tissues. This receptor has been reported to be involved in regulating the expression of some fat-specific genes, and plays a role in the adipogenic process (Amri. E. et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 270,2367-71, 1995).<br>
Atherosclerotic disease is known to be caused by a number of factors, for example, hvpertension, diabetes, low levels of high density Hpoproiein (HDU, and high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL).<br><br>
in addition lo risk reduction via effects on plasma iipid concentrations and other risk factors, PPARct agonists exert direct alhemprotective effects (Frick, M. H.,ei al. 1997.. Circulation 96:2137-2143, de Faire, etal. 1997. Cardiovasc. Drugs Then 11 Suppl 1:257-63:257-263).<br>
It has recently been discovered thai PPAR5 agonists are useful in raising HDL levels and therefore useful in treating atherosclerotic diseases. (Leibowitz ei al.; WO/9728149). Atherosclerotic diseases include vascular disease, coronary hean disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vessel disease. Coronary heart disease includes CHD death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization. Cerebrovascular disease includes ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and transient ischemic attacks.<br>
PPAR7 subtypes are involved in activating adipocyte differentiation, and are not involved in stimulating peroxisome proliferation in the liver. Activation of PPARf 's implicated in adipocyte differentiation through the activation of adipocyte-specific gene expression (Lehmann, Moore, Smith-Oliver, Wilkison, Willson, Kliewer. J. Biol. Chem., 270:12953-12956,1995). The DMA sequences for the PPARy receptors arc described in Eibrechi et aU BBRC 224;431-437 (1996). Although peroxisome proliferators, including fibrates and fatty acids, activate the transcriptional activity of PPAR's, only prost^landin J2 derivatives such as the arachidonic acid metabolite 15-deoxy-delta",14 -prostaglandin h (ISd-PGJj) have been identified as natural ligands specific for the PPARy subtype, which also binds thiazoiidinediones.This prostaglandin activates PPARy-dependent adipogenesis, but activates PPARa onlyathighcQncentrations(Forman,Tontono2,Cheti,Bnm,Spiegelman,Evans, Cell, 83:803-812, 1995; Kliewer, Lenhard, Wilson, Patel, Morris, Lehman, Cell, 83:813-819, 1995). This is further evidence that the PPAR family subtypes are distinct from one another in their pharmacological response to ligands.<br>
It has been suggested that compounds activating both PPARxt and PPARy should be potent hypotriglyceridemic drugs, which could be used in the treatment of dyslipidemia associated with atherosclerosis, non-insulin dependent diabetes meUitus,Syndrome X,. (Staels, B. et al., Cun. Pharm. Des., 3 (I), 1-14 (1997)) and familial combined hyperiipidemia (FCH). Syndrome X is the syndrome characterized by an initial insulin resistant stale, generating hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia and impaired glucose tolerance, which can progress to non-insutin dependent diabetes meliitus (Type 11 diabetes), characterized by hyperglycemia. FCH is characterized by hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia within the same patient and family.<br>

Compounds useful according to this invention can be prepared in segments as is common to a long chain molecule. Thus it is convenient to synthesize these molecules by employing condensation reactions at the A, B and D sites of the molecule. Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature. Compounds of Formula I are preparabie by recognized procedures from known compounds or readily preparabie intermediates. Thus, in order to prepare a compound of the below formula, where Z is generally CN or COiR<br><br>
The following reactions or combinations of reactions are employable:<br><br><br><br>
In the above schemes (1-3) a displacement reaction can be used when A, B and D are O, S or NR, and L is a leaving group such as halo, toslyate or mesylate. A base such as sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate or triethylamine may be used when A, B or D is O or S.<br>
An alternative coupling reaction is the Mitsunobu reaction (diethylazodicarboxylate/triphcnylphosphine see Synthesis, 1981, ]). This chemistry can be used to condense fragments when the functionality is amenable to this reaction. An example of this would be the coupling of compounds of scheme 1 where formula VI (L = OH, a &gt; 0) and formula VII (A = O, b - 0)<br>
Reaction temperatures are in the range of about -78 °C to 80 °C and reaction times vary from about 1 to 48 hours- The reactions are usually carried out in an inert solvent that will dissolve the veactants. Solvents include, but are not limited to N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Alternatively, the reactions shown in Schemes I -3 can be accomplished using a fragment of the described Formula. For example, as shown in Scheme 4, a compound of Formula VI (Scheme 1) may be combined with a compound of Formula VII, where Formula VII optionally contains Ar III and Z. This notation used for Formula Vll in Scheme 4 is used throughout this document and is used to generalize the described reaction. Therefore, all of the reactions of Schemes 1-3 may be accomplished as shown or by using a fragment of the described formula. In some instances, the use of a protecting group may be required when a fragment of a formula is used.<br><br>
One method for the preparation of compounds where Z = tetrazole is the reaction of an intermediate where Z = CN with sodium azide and ammonium chloride at an elevated temperature.<br><br>
One method for the preparation of compounds where 2 = C03H. is the hydrolysis of an intermediate where 2 is CN or COjR. This can be accomplished under acidic or basic conditions, with the preferred method generally being sodium or potassium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as aqueous ethanol at a temperature of about 20 °C to 100 °C.<br>
An alternative method for the conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is to reduce the nitrite to the corresponding aldehyde using a reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminum hydride, followed by oxidation of the aldehyde to the carboxylic acid using a reagent such as sodium chlorite, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, isobutene (See, J ACS 1980, 45, 1176) or other standard conditions.<br>
Another alternative method .For the preparation of compounds where Z = CO.H is the oxidation of a primary alcohol using an appropriate oxidant such as PDC in DMF. RuCI:. /Nal04 in 3:2:2 water aceionitrile : CClt or the Swem system (to produce the intermediate aldehyde rheii oxidation of this functionality to the carboxylic acid as described above).<br>
Some other methods for the preparation of compounds where Z = C02H are shown in Scheme 5 . A carboxylic acid (2) can be generated directly by halogen-metal exchange of the corresponding aromatic halide (I) with an alkyl lithium reagent such as n-butyliithium, followed by quenching the resulting anion with carbon dioxide. Alternatively, alkoxy-carbonyiation of an aromatic bromide, iodide or triflate can be accomplished in a carbon monoxide atmosphere in the presence of a suitable alcohol (usually methanol) using a catalyst such as Pd(PPh;hC1: / Et.NH. Pd(Ph;P(CH,)?PPh:): / Ei..N or alternatively cobalt, ie. CoCOAc)!, plus a base (NaH or KJCOJ). The resulting benzoate (3) is then converted to the benzoic acid by hydrolysis as described above.<br><br>
Preparation of phenvlacetic acid dcrhaiivcs can be accomplished from an appropriate aryl halide or triflate as illustrated in Scheme 6. Stille coupling of this type of compound with a vinyl stannane using a palladium catalyst such as Pd(0 Ac) i, P(o-tolyl)3 provides an olefin. (5). Hydroboration of this<br><br>
vinylbenzene dmvam c, followed by oxidation of the resulting primary alcohol with an oxidant, such as Jones' reagent, provides the phenylacetic acid (6).<br><br>
In one embodiment of the current invention, Arl can be a five membered ring heterocycle thus generating astructures of the general form shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
Figure !<br>
In particular, the heterocycle can be a substituted thiazole, oxazole, oxadiazole, imidazole, isoxazole, pyrazole, thiadiazole ortriazole. These systems can be prepared using methods known in the chemical literature (for reviews see Katritzky, A.R.; Rees, C.W. Eds. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemstry, Vol. 5; Pergamon Press (1984); Katritzky, A.R.; Rees, C.W.; Scriven, E.F.V. Eds. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemstry II; Vols 3 &amp; 4, Pergamon Press (1996)). More specifically, oxazoles, imidazoles and thiazoles can be prepared by fusion of an amide, amidine or a thioamide, respectively, with an «-halo-ketone at temperatures ranging from about 40 °C to 150 °C (Scheme 7).<br><br><br>
These reactions may be carried out neat, or in a solvent such as toluene, dichlorobenzene, or ethanol. Substituted oxazoles can also be prepared from a diazoketone and a nitrile using BFj etherate (Scheme 8), Ibata,T; Isogami, Y. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1989, 62, 618).<br><br>
1,2,4-OxadiaxoIes can be prepared by reaction of a nitrile with hydroxylamine followed by condensation of the resulting hydroxy-amidine with an acid chloride in the presence of a base and heating the adduct in a solvent such as toluene or dichlorobenzene to effect ring closure*. (Scheme 9, Banavara, L.M.; Beyer, T.A.; Scott, PJ.; Aldinger, C.E.; Dee, M.F.; siegel, T.W.; Zembrowsky, WJ. J. Med Chem., 1992, 35, 457).<br><br>
1,3,4-oxadiazsoIes are prepared (Scheme 10) by condensation of an acylhydrazide witfi an acid synthon (such as an ester, acid chloride acyl azide) then cyclization of the resulting diacyl-hydrazide by heating in a solvent such as benzene or ethanol with or without an acid catalyst such as sulphuric acid (for examples see Weidinger, H.; Kranz, J. Chem. Ber.. 1963, 96, 1049 and Vakula. T.R.; Srinivarsan, V.R. Indian J. Chem.. 1973, II. 112).<br><br><br>
Substituted 1,2,4-thiadiazoles can be prepared by condensation of a thioamide widi an N,N-dtmethylamide dimethyl acetal derivative in a solvent such as benzene (Scheme 11, MacLeod, A.; Baker, R.; Freedman, S.F.; Patel, S.; Merchant, K.J.; Roe, M. Saunders, J. J. Med Chem., 1990, 33,2052. also Patzel, M. Liebscher, J.; Siegfried, A. Schmitz, E. Synthesis, 1990, 1071) followed by reaction with an electrophilic aminating agent such as mesitylsulphonyloxyamine in methanol or dialkyloxaziridine in a solvent such as toluene.<br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention Aricanbea 1,3,4-thiadiazole. This system is assembled by condensation of a dithioester with an imidate ester salt in a solvent such as ethanol at a temperature between room temperature and reflux (Scheme 12. StUlmgs, M.R.; Welboum, A.P.; Walter, D.S. /. Med. Chem., 1986,29,2280). The dithioester precursor is obtained from the corresponding Grignard reagent and carbon disulphide / Mel. The imtdate ester is prepared from the corresponding nitrile by reaction with HCi gas in the presence of an appropriate alcohol.<br><br><br>
Pyrazoles can be prepared by condensation of a 1,3-diketone (Scheme 13) or a synthetic equivalent with a substituted hydrazine (for example, a p-aminoenone. Alberola, A.; Calvo, L.; Ortega, A.G..; Sadaba, MX-; Sanudo, M.C.; Granda, S.G.; Rodriguez, E.G., Heterocycles, 1999, 51, 2675).<br><br>
Similarly, isoxazoles can be prepared by reaction of a 1,3 dicarbonyl compound with hydroxyl amine (Scheme 14. Pei, Y.; Wickham, B.O.S.; Tetrahedron Letts, 1993, 34, 7509) in a solvent such as ethanol a a temperature between 20 °C to reflux temperature.<br><br>
Alternatively, isoxazoles can be prepared by condensation of a hydroxanwl chloride with an alkyne<br>
(Scheme 15, Kano, H.; Adachi, !.; Kido, R.; Hirose, K. J.Med. Chem.  1967. 10, 411) in the presence o<br><br>
a base such as triethyiamine. The hydroxamyl chloride unit can, in turn, be prepared from the corresponding oxime by oxidation with chlorine gas at low temperature (such as -60 °C) in a solvent such as ether (Casanti, G. Ricca, A. Tetrahedron Lett., 1967, 4, 327).<br><br>
Triazoles are prepared by the Einhorn-Bnmner reaction or a variant thereof (Scheme J 6)<br><br>
In addition, 5-hydroxymethyl substituted 1,2,4-triazoles can be prepared by condensation of an imidate ester with an 2-hydroxy-acetohydrazide unit (Scheme 17. Browne, E. J.;Nunn, E. E-; Polya, J. B.J. Chem.Soc.,C 1970, 1515).<br><br>
The five membered heterocycles, so formed, can, in certain cases, be coupled directly with a fragment containing Aril using standard methodology detailed elsewhere in the description of this invention (Schemes 1-4). These methods include alkylation of metal alkoxide containing Aril with a chloromethyl substituted heterocycle, or conversely, alkylation of a hydroxyl appended heterocycle (in the presence of a base) with a chloromethyl reagent containing Aril.<br>
In another approach to fragment condensation, the substituents on the preformed heterocycle are first modified to incorporate suitable reactive functionality then this system is coupled to a fragment<br><br>
containing Aril. FOT example (Scheme 18), treatment of a 1 ,4-disubstituted imidazole with a base such as n-butyl lithium at a temperature of around -78 °C followed by alkylation of the resulting anion with an electrophiie such as ethylene oxide provides the hydroxyethyl-substituted imidazole {other useful electrophiles are DMF or formaldehyde. For example see Manoharan, T.S.; Brown, R.S. J. Org. Chetn., 1989, 54, 1439). This intermediate can then be coupled to an Aril fragment containing an aromatic alcohol via a Mitsunobu reaction.<br><br>
Another example of this genera! approach is shown in Scheme 19. A ring substituent such as an ester can be reduced to the corresponding alcohol using a reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride or lithium borohydride in a solvent such as THF or ether. Followed by halogenation of the resulting alcohol with a reagent system such as NCS / Ph3P, Ph3P / Br2 or PBr3 (Pei, Y.; Wickham, B.O.S.; Tetrahedron Lett., 1993, 34, 7509). The alkyl halide produced in this manner can be coupled with a nucleophilic substituent attached to Aril, using a base such as K2CO3 in the case of an aromatic alcohol, (thiol) or NaH in the case of an aliphatic alcohol (thiol).<br><br><br>
in a third general approach to fragment condensation, Ar II can be incorporated into a precursor of the five membered heterocycle. For example (Scheme 20), animation of the 3-aryl-propionate and thionation of the resulting amide provides a suitable functionalized system for thiazole ring synthesis. Similarly formation of the thio-urea from the arylmethyl amine (path B) provides a suitable precursor for fusion with an ?-haloketone leading to a 2-amino-substituted diiazole (Collins, JX.; Blanchard, S- G.; Boswell, G. E.; Charifson, P. S.; Cobb, J. E.; Henke, B. R.; Hull-Ryde, E. A.; Kazmierski, W. M.; Lake, D. H.; Leesnitzer, L. M.; Lehmann, J.; Lenhard, J. M.; Orband-Miller L.A.; Gray-Nunez, Y.; Parks, D. J.; plimkett, K. D.; Tong, Wei-Qin. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 5037).<br><br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention, Arl is a five membered heterocycle of general formula shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
W ■ CRlr N; X - CRi. N; Y= CR,. N; Z ~ CR, N Provided that when A = O, N, or S then "a" is &gt; 1<br>
Figure 2<br>
In particular, this heterocycle can be a pyrazole, an imidazole or a triazole. These systems can be prepared by alkylation of an Af-unsubstituted heterocycle using a base such as sodium hydride, in a solvent such as DMF, THF, DMPU or a combination of these solvents, at or around 0 °C and an electrophile such as an alkyl halide, cyclic carbonate or an epoxide (Scheme 21).<br><br><br>
These electrophiles can incorporate Aril or the alkylation products can be further modified and coupled to a fragment containing Aril in a subsequent step as described above. For example (Scheme 22), The 3,5-disubstituted pyrazole is prepared by reacting an aldehyde with a {J-tosylhydrazinophosphonate, using the literature procedure (Almirante, N.; Benicchio, A.; Ccni, A.; Fedrizzi, G.; Marazzi, G.; Santagostmc, M. Synleti 1999, 299). This intermediate can then be alkylated with sodium hydride / ethylene carbonate in DMF (for a specific example see Collins, J.L.; Blanchard, S. G.; Boswell, G. E.; Charifson, P. S.; Cobb, J. E.; Henke, B. R.; Hull-Ryde, E. A.; Kazmierski, W. M.; Lake, D. H.; Leesnitzer, L. M.; Lehmann, J.; Lenhard, J. M.; Orband-Miller L.A.; Gray-Nunez, Y.; Parks, D. J.; Plunkett, K. D.; Tong, Wei-Qin. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 5037). This intermediate can in mm be coupled to a fragment containing Aril by a Mitsunobu reaction as described above.<br><br>
Scheme 22<br>
In another embodiment of this invention Arl is a substituted benzene, pyridine, pyrimidme, pyrazme or pyridazine (Figure 3). These systems can be prepared by applying several of the general synthetic methods detailed elsewhere in the description of this invention.<br><br><br>
More specifically (Scheme 23), treatment of the known 5-bromo-2-methyl-pyridine (Graf. J. Praia. Chem., 1932,133, 19.) with LDA then formaldehyde in THF at low temperature (typically around -78 °C) followed by Mitsunobu coupling of the resulting alcohol to an aromatic alcohol containing Aril gives the bromo-pyridine derivative which can be further modified to give various alkyl and aryl substituted pyridines by cross coupling with an appropriate alkyl or aryl organometallic under palladium or nickel , catalysis (For general reviews see Knight, D.W. and Billington, D.C in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis Vol. 3, p 413 and 481, Trost, B.M. and Fleming, I; Eds. Pergamon Press 1993).<br><br>
Similar procedures using the appropriate 5-bromo-2-methyi-pyrimidine (Kosoiapoff, G.M.; Roy, C.H. J. Org. Chem., 1961. 26. I 895), 2-iodo-5-methy|-pyrazine (Hirshberg, A.: Spoerr, P.E.;. J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26.1907) and 3-bromo-6-methyl-pyridazine (Counotte-Potman, A.; van der Plas. H.C.; J.<br><br>
Heterocyclic Chem., 1983, 20, 1259) provide access to the corresponding pyrimidines, pyrazines and pyridazines respectively.<br>
In another variant of this general class, Arl is a 3-heteroatom-substituted pyridazine. For example (Scheme 24), treatment of the known 3,6-dibromo- pyridazine with a metal alkoxide (containing Aril and derived from the corresponding alcohol and sodium hydride) in a solvent such as DMSO provides the alkoxy-substituted bromo-pyridazine. The bromide can be convened into a range of substituents as described above for pyridines. In particular, Suzuki coupling with a boronic acid in the presence of a base and a palladium catalyst provides the corresponding aryl substituted pyridazines.<br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention Arl can be a substituted quinoxaline (Figure 4). These systems are assembled by condensation of a 1,2-dicarbonyf compound with a 1,2 diamino-benzene (for a review, see Kfltritzky, A.R.; Rees, C.W.; Striven, E.F.V, Eds. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemsny II; Vol 6 Pergamon Press (1996).<br><br>
Funetionalixation of these systems and coupling to Aril can be effected using procedures described for the related pyrazines. For example (Scheme 25), condensation of 1,2-diamino-benzene with 2,3-butadione provides the 2,3-dimethyI quinoxaline. A'-oxidation of this intermediate with a peroxy-carboxyiic acid and treatment of the product with acetyl chloride gives the 2-chloromethy 1-3 -methyl quinoxaoline (Ahmed,<br><br>
Y.; Habib, M.S.; Bakhtiari, B- Bakhtiari, Z. J. Org. Chem., 1966, 31, 2613). This intennediate is then coupled to a fragment containing Ar II under standard conditions.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the current invention Arl can be a quinazoline (Scheme 26). Such systems are commonly prepared by condensation of an o-amino-benzaldehyde or o-amino-aryl-kstone derivative with an acid chloride followed by heating with ammonia. For example, condensation of o-amino-benzaldehyde with chloroacetyl chloride in the presence of pyridine followed by reaction of the product with ethanolic ammonia at room temperature (Armarego, W.L.F.; Smith, J. I. C. J. Chem. Soc, C, 1966, 234) provides a 2-chloromethyI substituted quinazoline which can be coupled to a iragment containing Aril as described above.<br><br>
The related quinazoIin-4-one ring system (Scheme 27) can be prepared by condensation of an o-amino-benzonitrile and an acid chloride followed by ring closure using a reagent such as urea hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate (Bavetsias, y. Synth. Commxm. 1998, 28, 4547). In another variant of the quinazoline system, 4-heteroatom substituted quinazolines can be prepared by condensation of an amino-benzoniirile with chlorocetonitrile in the presence of an acid such as HCi or HBr(Chhabria,M. T.;Shishoo, C.J. Heierocycles 1999, 51, 2723.). The resulting system can be coupled to Aril as described above. The 4-halo-substituem can then be modified by nucleophilic displacement by a metal alkoxide in a solvent such as DMSO.<br><br>
&gt; <br>
A general reaction for the preparation of reagents such compounds of formulas VI, IX, X XIII and XIV (schemes 1-3) is shown in Scheme 28. Halogenation of a methyl substituted aromatic with a reagent such as N-bromosuccinimide under free radical conditions provides the halomethyl substituted aromatic reagents.<br><br>
An alternative preparation of certain alkylating reagents is shown in Scheme 29. For example, substituted 2-chloromethyl quinoline derivatives can be prepared using a two step procedure (See, J. Med. Chem. 1991,34,3224). Oxidation of the nitrogen to form the N-oxide can be acheived with an oxidant such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide. Reaction of the N:oxide with a reagent such as toluene sulfonylchloride at elevated temperatures can produce the target chloromethyl derivative. This chemistry can also be extended to 2-picoline derivatives where the 6-position is non-hydrogen.<br><br><br>
Preparation of reagents which can be used as alkylating agenets of formula VI (scheme 1) are shown in Scheme 30. With the quinoxaline ring system the use of trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCC) can produce the corresponding chloromethyl analog (See, Chem. Ber. 1987,120, 649).<br><br>
In a particular embodiment of this invention, B of Formula I can be an amide linker of eititerof the general forms shown in Figure 5. Compounds of this formula can be prepared from a carboxylic acid fragment and an amine fragment using standard peptide coupling reagents. They can also be prepared by reaction with an activated carboxylic acid derivative such as, but hot limited to, an acid chloride or anhydride in combination with an amine fragment in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. It should be clear that essentially the same procedures can be used in the case where group A of Formula I is an amide using the appropriate carboxylic acid and amine fragments.<br><br>
More specifically, the 2-aminomethyl-6-substituted-benzoic acid system (7) can be prepared using the chemistry shown in Scheme 31. Selective reduction of the substituted Dhthalic anhvdride (9) with a<br><br>
sterically hindered lithium trial klyborohyd ride, such as L-seleciride; provides lactone (10) regioseiectively (See Krishnamurthy, Heterocycles, 1982,18, 4525). Reaction of this lactone with potassium phthaiimide provides the protected amine according to the procedure of Bomstein, Ors.Syn. Collective Vol IV, 1963, 810. Removal of the phthalimide protecting group using standard deprotectfon conditions with hydrazine can provide the amino acid (7).<br><br>
1,2-Carboxylic acid-half esters such as 12 (Scheme 32) are precursors to amide linked structures (Figure 5) in which the Arlll containing fragment is the acyl doner. These systems can be prepared in several ways: Alcoholysis of the phthalic anhydride (9) can provide selectively isomer (11) plus smaller amounts of isomer (12). EsterificatiDn to provide the diester (13) can be accomplished using a variety of conditions, such as Fisher esterification. Hydrolysis of the diester can provide the regioisomer (12) as me major isomer in addition to isomer (II).<br><br>
Phthalic anhydride derivatives such as (9) can, in turn, be prepared from the corresponding diacid (14) as shown in Scheme 33 using dehydrating conditions such as, but not limited to. hot acetic anhydride.<br><br><br>
In one embodiment of this invention, ArllHCRpRioVEHCRtiRuVE-Z taken together constitutes a substituted benzoic acid. A useful sequence of reactions for constructing this kind of system is shown in Scheme 34. A lactone (obtained as described in Scheme 31) can be heated with hydrobromic acid to provide the bromomethyl carboxylic acid. The carboxylate can be esterified by preparing the acid chloride, followed by reaction with an alcohol to provide an intermediate bromide which can be used as outlined in Scheme 2, Formula XIII.<br><br>
An alternative benzoate substitution pattern can be accessed using the Aider-Rickert reaction as shown in Scheme 35 (See, J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 560). A 2-silyloxydiene can be formed from an enone using a strong base such as LDA and trapping the enolate with a silylating reagent. Heating this diene with an acetylenedicarboxylate at elevated temperatures can then yield the Alder-Rickert product. Alkylation of the phenolic hydroxy! under standard conditions (using the alkylating reagent R'-L, where L is a leaving group) followed by saponification of the diester can provide a diacid intermediate which can be manipulated according to the chemistry described in figures 31-34 to provide useful intermediates for the preparation of compounds of Formula I.<br><br><br>
Another particular embodiment of this invention is one in which the substituted benzoic acid moiety described above has a 6-aIkyl-2-aIkoxy substituent pattern. The preparation of this kind of system is illustrated using the 6-methyI derivative shown in Scheme 36 (See Hamada, Tetrahedron. 1991, 41, 8635). Ethyl acetoacetate and crotonaldehyde can be condensed to form the cyclic (3-ketoester. Subsequent lithium chloride / cupric chloride mediated aromatization of this intermediate can be accomplished at elevated temperatures to provide the target salicylate ester. The phenolic hydroxyl of this system can be further derivatized by alkylation as outlined elsewhere in the description of this invention.<br><br>
Additionally, 6-alkyl-2-aIkoxy benzoate systems can be prepared by aromatic nucleophilic substitution of a 2-fluorobenzaidehyde, at elevated temperatures, with an alkoxide (Scheme 37) to produce a 2-aIkoxy-benzaidehyde. Oxidation of the aldehyde to the acid can then be accomplished using conditions such as sodium chlorite, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, isobutene (See, JACS 1980, 45, 1176).<br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention, B of Formula I can be a sulfur atom forming a thioether linkage (Scheme 2, Formulas (XI and XII). This type of system can be prepared by standard thiol alkylation using a suitable base (such as sodium or potassium carbonate, hydroxide, hydride or an amine such as triethylamine) to form an anion of the thiol and then reaction of this species with an appropriate electrophile such as an alky! halide or sulphonaie ester. Similarly, the groups A and D of Formula I can also be, independently, a sulfur atom. It should be clear that he same transformations described in the Schemes below can be applied to compounds of Formulas (VII. VIII. XI. XII and XVI: schemes 1-3).<br><br>
Aromatic thiols can be prepared from the corresponding phenols. For example, preparation of a 2-thio-benzoate(IO) from the salicylate (7), can be carried out as shown in Scheme 38. (See, Guise J. Chem Soc, Perkin Trans. 1,1982, 8, 1637). The thionocarbamate (8) can be obtained from the corresponding phenol (7) using a thiocarbamoyl chloride. Pyrolysis of (8) (-&gt;300 °C) can yield the rearrangement product (9) which upom hydrolysis can yield the thiol (10).<br><br>
Another useful ring substituent transformation is the conversion of an aniline to an aromatic thiol. As shown in Scheme 39, diazotization of an aniline such as (11) is followed by conversion of the diazonium salt (12) to a disulfide(13) using sodium sulfide. Reduction of the disulfide with zinc/acetic acid can yield the thiol (14) (See, Guise J. Chem Soc, Perkin Trans. 1,1982, 5, 1637).<br><br>
In a particular embodiment of this invention, Arfll can be a halo-substituted aromatic. Synthesis of a particularly relevant system is outlined in scheme 40. Regioselective halogenatton of a 2,6-disubstituted-phenol to provide the 4-halophenol system can be accomplished with a halogenating reagent such as sulfuryl chloride (See, J. Het. Chem. 1989,26, 1547). The phenolic hydroxyl group can be further derivitized as outlined elsewhere in the description of this invention.<br><br><br>
Scheme 40<br>
An alternative method for the preparation of a halo (or alkoxy Substituted benzoate is shown in Scheme 41. An aniline is first converted to its diazonium salt using nitrous acid, followed by transformation to the corresponding nitrile using a reagent such as cuprous cyanide (See Chem. Ber. 1983,116, 1183). The cyano group is then hydrolyzed to the acid (see, Fuson, JACS 1941, 63, 1679). The acid may then be protected as an ester to allow further derivitization of the system as outlined elsewhere in the description of this invention.<br>
X = halogen or alkoxy<br><br>
An ortho-haio-benzoate can be prepared similarly, by diazotization of an o-carboxy aniline, followed by reaction with a copper haltde (Scheme 42).<br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention, ArlH is a benzofuranyl or dihydrobenzofuranyl carboxylic acid as illustrated in Figure 6<br><br><br>
Benzofuran-2-carboxylate derivatives can be prepared as shown in Scheme 43 by cyclization of the appropriately substituted 2-carbonyl-phenoxyacetate under basic conditions. Reduction of the resulting benzofuran to die corresponding 2,3-dihydro-benzofuran can be accomplished using sodium mercury amalgam under basic conditions. (See, J. Med Chem. 1984, 27, 570).<br><br>
An alternative synthesis of die 23-dihydrobenzofuran-2-carboxyIate ring system is shown in Scheme 44 (See, J. Med. Chem. 1981, 865). Claisen rearrangement of a substituted ailyl-phenyl ertier at an elevated temperature such as 250 °C either neat or in a solvent such as dimethylaniline, can provide die o-aliyl-phenol. Peracid oxidation of this intermediate provides the 2-hydroxymethyl-2^3-dihydroberizofuran. which can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid using a variety of oxidizing agents such as Jones' reagent<br><br>
In anotfier embodiment of this invention "A" can be an imidazoiidin-2-one, a tetrahydropyrimidtn-2-one an imidazoline-2,4-dione, or a tetrahydropyrimidin-2,4-dinone (Figure 7).<br><br><br>
These systems are prepared from an amine containing Arl by sequential acylation, aminofysis, ring closure and reduction, as illustrated in Scheme 45 (For examples see Kitazaki, T.; asaka, A.; Tamura, K; Matsushita, Y.; Hosono, H.; Hayashi, R.; Okonogi, K.; Itoh, K. Chem. Pharm. Bull, 1999, 47, 351 and Basha, A.; Tetrahedron Lett., 1988, 29, 2525). Coupling to Aril can be effected by derivitization of the cyclic urea N by treatment with a base such as NaH in THF at around 0 °C then alkylation of the resulting anion with an electrophile such as an alkyl bromide / inflate containing Aril).<br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention Aril is a six membered ring aromatic of general form substituted shown in Figure R. In particular. Aril is a substituted benzene, pyridine, pyrimidint, pyridazine or pyrazine.<br><br>
In principle, appropriately functionaiized ring systems of this kind can be prepared by functionaiization of specific precursors followed by ring synthesis or by derivatization of a preformed ring system. There are numerous approaches to the synthesis and functionaiization of the aforementioned cyclic frameworks in the chemicai literature (for examples, see (a) Katritzky, A.R.; Rees. C.W.; Scriveti,<br><br>
E.F.V. Eds. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemstry II, Vol 5 and Vol 6. Elsevier Science 1996 and references therein). For example, (Scheme 46} alkylation of methyl glycolate with an alkyl halide containing Arl using a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as THF or DMSO provides the ester. Claisen condensation of this ester with r-butyl acetate at low temperature (typically below -15 ^C) using a base such as LDA in THF provides the keto ester intermediate. This is reacted with formamidlne acetate in the presence of a base such as sodium methoxide in methanol to give the pyrimidinone (Butters, M. J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1992,29, 1369). This type of substituted aromatic system can be further functionaiized to incorporate Arl as described elsewhere in the description of this invention.<br><br>
In certain cases, Aril (in Figure 8) can be assembled by ring transformation of another heterocycle, for example, treatment of the known 4-bromo-2-methoxy-furan (Scheme 47, Marin i-Bettolo, R-; Flecker, P.; Tsai, T. Y. R.; Wiesner, K.Can. J. Chem. 1981, 59, 1403) with an alkyl lithium at low temperature and reaction of this anion with an electrophile containing Arlll (such as a bromide, aldehyde, epoxide) provides the 4-substituted furan. Oxidative cleavage of this intermediate widi dioxirane followed by treatment with hydrazine provides the pyridazinone which can be further modified to incorporate Arl as illustrated elsewhere in die description of this invention.<br><br><br>
A particularly useful protocol with regard to functionalization of heterocycles involves Mitsunobu etherification of hydroxy) substituted heterocycles (or keto-tautomers) such as outlined in Scheme 48. Treatment of the known 6-brDmo-pyridJn-2-0ne (Wibaut, J.P.; Waayman, P.W.; Vaudijlt, J. Jtec. Trav. Chinu Pays-Bas. 1940,59, 202) with an alcohol containing an Arl (or Arlll) under Mitsunobu's conditions provides the corresponding bromo-substituted pyridyl ether, (for typical procedures see Mitsunobu. 0., Synthesis, 1981, 1).<br><br>
The heterocyclic bromide, so formed, can be further functionaiized in a number of ways. For example, coupling with a vinyi stannane can be effected under palladium (o) catalysis to provide systems with alkenyl linkers (Scheme 49).<br><br><br>
The choice of catalyst and reaction temperature for this transformation depends on the substrate employed but is most commonly tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium.bis(triphenylphosphine)paIladium chloride, 1,1 '-bis(diphenyiphosphino)ferrocene/bis-dibenzy]ideneacetone palladium or 1,2 bis-(diphenylphosphino)ethane/bis(acetonhrile)dichloropaIladium at a temperature between 50 and !50'°C. Suitable solvents include DMF, DMPU, HMPA, DMSO, toluene, and DME. (for examples see Farina, V. Krishnamurthy, V.; Scon, WJ. Organic Reactions, 1997,50, 1). Reduction of the olefin using, for example, Wilkinson's catalyst in a solvent such as toluene, THF or an alcohol at a temperature between about 20 and SO °C provides the corresponding alkane linked system.<br>
In certain heterocyclic systems in which a bromide or chloride is situated ortho or para to a ring nitrogen, the halogen can be readily displaced by an alcohol (in the presence of base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as Toluene, DMSO, THF, DMPU or HMPA) at or above room temperature (For examples see Kelly, T.R. et al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1994,116, 3657 and Newcome, G.R. et al J. Org. Chem., 1977, 42, 1500). For example, alcoholysis of a 2,4-dichloro-pyrimidine (Scheme 50) using a controlled stoichiometric amount of an alcohol reagent containing Arl (or Arill) provides the aJkoxy substituted-bromo-pyrimidine. Subsequent reaction of this product (generally above room temperature) with a further equivalent of another alcohol containing Arill (or Arl) provides the unsymmetricatly dialkoxy-substituted heterocycle. Since the 4-position of the dichloro-pyrirnidine is generally displaced first, the order in which the alkoxy substituents are introduced will dictate their orientation in the product.<br><br>
Similar procedures using 2,6-dibromc-pyridine or 2,6-dibromo-pyridazine provides the corresponding dialkoxy-substituted pyridines and pyridazines.<br>
A simple alkoxy group positioned ortho to a nitrogen in these heterocyclic systems can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding hydroxy substituent using aqueous hydrochloric acid at a temperature normally between room temperature and reflux. (Scheme 51).<br><br><br>
For example (Scheme 5 \\ treatment of the 2-methaxy-6-alkyl-substituted pyridine derivative with hydrochloric acid provides the 6-alkyl substituted pyridin-2-one. This intermediate, in turn, can be further derivatized to the corresponding 2-aIkoxy or 2-aIkenyl substituted systems as detailed elsewhere in die sdescription of this invention.<br>
A methyl, methylene or methine group positioned ortho to a ring nitrogen in these heterocyclic systems can be deprotonated widi a base such as an alkyl lithium or LDA in a solvent such as THF, emer or HMPA, generally at low temperature (below 0°C) and the resulting anion reacted with electrophiles such as aldehydes, epoxides, alkyl halides or a,pVunsaturaied carbonyl compounds to provide a variety of functionalized heterocycles.<br><br><br>
Scheme 52<br>
For example (Scheme 52) the 2-aIkoxy-4-methyl-pyrimidine is treated, sequentially, with LDA and an aldehyde at -78 °C to" give the hydroxy substituted adduct. Subsequent dehydration of this intermediate with martin sulfurane in a solvent such as dichloromethane.at ambient temperature followed by hydrogenation of the resulting olefin provides the 4-ArI-containing-aIkyl-2-alkoxy-pyrimidme. Similar procedures applied to 2-chIoro-6-methyl-pyrazine (Karmas, G.; Spoerri, P.E.; J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1952, 74, 1580) leads to the corresponding pyrazine.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, A can be an amide thus generating compounds of the formulas shown in Figure 9.<br><br>
Figure 9 The preparation of an illustrative example within this series is shown in scheme 53. A hydroxy aldehyde can be reacted with a bromoalkyl-ester to provide an aldehyde-ester intermediate. Reductive amination of the aldehyde followed by acylation can provide the amide.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, compounds of the invention may be easily synthesized by solid phase methods, as illustrated in Schemes 54 and 55, using inputs (XII) - (XVII) listed in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
An additional exemplification of the amide linker is shown in Scheme 56. Reaction of an activated carboxylic acid derivative such as, but not limited to, an acid chloride or anhydride with an amine of genera) formula (15) and a suitable base such as triethylamine provides the amide {16). More explicit exemplification is shown in Scheme 57. Carboxylic acid (17) is activated widi oxafyl chloride to provide the acid chloride and then 2-amino-6-methylbenzoic acid (IS), is added to provide the amide (19). Alternatively, 2-aminom ethyl-6-methylbenzoic acid (20) can be used to provide the amide (21).<br><br>
The preparation of 2-aminom ethyl-6-methylbenzoic acid, (20), can be accomplished using the chemistry shown in Scheme 31 (X = Me, R' = H).<br><br>
Compounds useful according to the invention may also be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature, for example those described by R. C. Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations. VCH publishers, 1989.<br>
In the reactions described hereinafter, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions.   Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see T.W. Green and P.G.M.Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" John Wiley and Sons, 1991; J. F. W. McOmie in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" Plenum Press, 1973.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention, compounds useful according to the invention may be prepared by interconversion of other compounds of the invention.<br>
A compound of the invention including a group containing one or more nitrogen ring atoms, preferably imine (=N-), may be converted to the corresponding compound wherein one or more nitrogen ring atom of the group is oxidized to an N-oxide, preferably by reacting with a peracid, for example peracetic acid in acetic acid or m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature from about room temperature to reflux, preferably at elevated temperature.<br>
The products of this invention may be obtained as racemic mixtures of their dextro and levorotatory isomers since at least one asymmetric carbon atom may be present. When two asymmetric carbon atoms are present, the product may exist as a mixtures of diastereomers based on syn and anti configurations. These diastereomers may be separated by fractional crystallization. Each diastereomer may then be resolved into dextro and levorotatory optical isomers by conventional methods.<br>
It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain compounds of Formula I may exhibit geometrical isomerism. Geometrical isomers include the cis and trans forms of compounds of the invention having an alkenyl moiety. The present invention comprises the individual geometrical isomers and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Such isomers can be separated from their mixtures, by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example chromatographic techniques and recrystallization techniques, or they are separately prepared from the appropriate isomers of their intermediates, for example by the application or adaptation of memods described herein.<br><br>
Resolution may best be carried out in the intermediate stage where it is convenient to combine the racemic compound with an optically active compound by salt formation, ester formation, or amide formation to form two diasteromeric products. If an acid is added to an optically active base, then two diastereomeric salts are produced which possesses different properties and different solubilities and can be separated by fractional crystallization. When the salts have been completely separated by repeated crystallization, the base is split off by acid hydrolysis and enantiomericaliy purified acids are obtained.<br>
Compounds useful according to the invention are useful in the form of the free base or acid or in the form of a pharmaceutical hy acceptable salt thereof. Ail forms are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Where a compound useful according to the invention is substituted with a basic moiety, acid addition salts are formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the sale, so that the beneficial pharmaceutical effects of these compounds in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as an intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts useful within the scope of the invention are those derived from the following acids: mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, trifiuoroacetic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesufonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like. The corresponding acid addition salts comprise the following: hydrohalides, e.g. hydrochloride and hydrobromide, trifluoroacetate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfamate, acetate, citrate, lactate, tartarate, malonate, oxalate, salicylate, propionate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, methylene-bis-p-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, mesylates, isothionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methanesulfonaies, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamate and quinate, respectively.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds useful according to the invention are prepared by reaction of the free base with the appropriate acid, by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, the acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous-alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate<br><br>
acid and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an orsanic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution.<br>
The compounds useful according to the invention may be regenerated from the acid addition'salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds useful according to the invention can be regenerated from their acid addition salts by treatment with an alkali, e.g., aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution or aqueous ammonia solution.<br>
Where the compound useful according to the invention is substituted with an acidic moiety, base addition salts may be formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free acid form. The bases which can be used to prepare the base addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose cations are non-toxic to the animal organism in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial pharmaceutical effects onthe activity of the compounds of die present invention in the free acid are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the cations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts useful according to the invention, include for example alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, including those derived from the following bases: sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glucamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline, N,N%3ibenzyiethylenediamine, chJoroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, diethylamine, N-benzylphenediylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethy!)aminomethane, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and the like.<br>
Metal salts of compounds useful according to the present invention may be obtained by contacting a hydride, hydroxide, carbonate or similar reactive compound of the chosen metal in an aqueous or organic solvent with the free acid form of the compound. The aqueous solvent employed may be water or it may be a mixture of water with an organic solvent, preferably an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, a ketone such as acetone, an aliphatic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or an ester such as ethyl acetate. Such reactions are normally conducted at ambient temperature but they may, if desired, be conducted with heating.<br>
Amine salts of compounds useful according to the present invention may be obtained by contacting an amine in an aqueous or organic solvent with the free acid form of the compound. Suitable aqueous solvents include water and mixtures of water with alcohols such as methanol or ethanol. ethers such as tetrahydrofuran- nitriles such as acetonitrile, or keiones such as acetone. Amino acid salts may be similarly prepared.<br><br>
The base addition salts of the compounds useful according to the invention can be regenerated from the salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds useful according to the invention can be regenerated from their base addition salts by treatment with an acid^ e.g. hydrochloric acid.<br>
Salt forms useful according to the invention also include compounds having a quariemarized<br>
nitrogen. The quarternarized salts are formed by methods such as by alkyiation of sp"* or sp   hybridized nitrogen in the compounds.<br>
As will be seif-evident to those skilled in the art, some of the compounds useful according to the invention do not form stable salts. However, acid addition salts are most likely to be formed by compounds useful according to the invention having a nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group and/or wherein the compounds contain an amino group as a substituent Preferable acid addition salts of the compounds useful according to the invention are those wherein there is not an acid labile group.<br>
As well as being useful in themselves as active compounds, the salts of the compounds useful according to the invention are useful for the purposes of purification of the compounds, for example oy exploitation of the solubility differences between the salts and the parent compounds, side products and/or starting materials by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. .<br>
Various substituents on the compounds useful according to the invention, e.g_, as defined in R, R| and Ri can be present in the starting compounds, added to any one of die intermediates or added after formation of the final products by known methods of substitution or conversion reactions. If the substituents themselves are reactive, then the substituents can themselves be protected according to the techniques known in the art. A variety of protecting groups known in the art may be employed. Examples of many of these possible groups may be found in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T. W. Green, John Wiley and Sons, 1981. For example, nitro groups can be added to the aromatic ring by nitration, and the nitro group then converted to other groups, such as amino, by reduction, and halo, by diazotization of the amino group and replacement of the diazo group. Acyl groups can be substituted onto the aryl groups by Friedel-Crafts acyiation. The acyl groups then can be transformed to the corresponding alkyl groups by various methods, including the Wolff-Kishner reduction and Clemmenson reduction. Amino groups can be alkylated to form mono and dialkyiamino groups; and mercapto and hydroxy groups can be alkylated to form corresponding ethers. Primary alcohols can be oxidized by oxidizing agents known in the art to form earboxylic acids or aldehydes, and secondary alcohols can be oxidized to<br><br>
form ketones. Thus, substitution or alteration reactions can be employed to provide a variety of substituents throughout the molecule of the starring material, intermediates, or the final product.<br>
The starting materials, intermediates and some compounds of the invention are prepared by tHe application or adaptation of known methods, for example methods as described in US Patent No.s 4,920,132; 4,920,131; and 5,059,610; publications Huang, Fu Chin et al, J. Med. Chem. (1991), 34(5), 1704-7; and Huang, Fu Chih et al, J.Med. Chem. (1990), 33(4), 1194-200; and the Reference Examples or their obvious chemical equivalents.<br>

A solution of methyl 2-methyl-6-[3-(quiooIin-2-yhnethoxy)-phenoxymethyl]-benzoate (1.6 g, 3,8 mmol, example 4) in ethanol (25 mL) is heated with a ION sodium hydroxide solution (4.0 mL, 40 mmol) at 70 °C for 14 h. The reaction is cooled, neutralized with a 2N HC1 solution (20 mL) and concentrated to remove the ethanol. Ethyl acetate is added and washed with water. The aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and back extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to yield a crude solid. The solid is purified by column chromatography (silica, 5 to 10% methanol in dichloromethane) to provide the title compound. An analytically pure sample is prepared by recystallization from methanol: m.p. 167-168 °C, 'HNMRQOO MHZ, CDC13) S.15(d,2H), 7.80 (d, 1H), 7.71 (t, 1H), 7.61-7.51 (m, 2H), 7.26-7.10 (m, 3H), 7.00 (t, 1H), 6.66 (s, 1H), 6.52 (d, 1H), 6.46 (d, 1H), 5.26 (s, 2H), 5.15 (s, 2H), 2.44 (s, 3H); MS (ESI) 400 (M+Hf.<br>
