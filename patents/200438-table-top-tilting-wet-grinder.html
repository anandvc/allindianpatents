This   Invention   relates   to   a   'TABLE   TOP   TILTING   WET GRINDER'.<br>
Conventional Grinders hitherto known, basically consisted of a Base Stone, upon which one or more stones of either cylindrical or conical cross-section would press against and were held together by gravity, spring force or any other suitable means. The relative motion between the base stone and the roller stones resulted in rubbing and rolling action between the contacting surface and thus the grinding of the food particles took place. The manual system was improved upon by use of an electric motor to rotate the base stone.<br>
The grinders evolved earlier were very bulky in nature and owing to its weight, it was normally placed on the ground. The biggest draw back in this grinder was that the ground paste was to be removed manually from the cylindrical drum, which was tedious and resulted in a lot of wastage. Further, lifting the grinding stones for cleaning purpose was not only painful but risky also. The next stage in the evolution of a Hi-tech grinder was the introduction of a tilting type wet grinder, which had the provision to swivel around its axis, consequent to which the flow of ground paste was easy, owing to gravitational force. Further, one step ahead was the introduction of a table tap wet grinder, which was portable in nature and was of light weight. Handling was much easier now, as there was no necessity to bend for operating purpose and could be positioned on the kitchen platform, adjacent to other cooking implements. However, these types of table-top grinders lacked the tilting facility. Thus, it was found that the tilting models available in the market hitherto were not table- top as the drum could not be<br><br>
removed for using the bottom drive for any other purpose. On the other hand the Table -Top models available in the market were not tiltable. This 'TABLE TOP TILITING WET GRINDER' is designed in such a way that it is a Table Top Grinder and at the same time it could be tilted to any angle from the vertical to the horizontal position on either sides and lodced at that particular position for easy handling. Further, this TABLE TOP TILTING WET GRINDER' has a unique drive mechanism, which is a combination of belt drive and gear drive, aimed at higher torque, consuming the same power of the motor. The combination of these two drives necessitated the placement of the drum above the motor and was a sort of "blessing in disguise", resulting in a vertical sleek model and thereby occupying less place and also adding to the aesthetics of the grinder. Added advantage is that the steel drum with the stone bottom can be screwed onto the bottom unit for mainly two purpose, primarily for safety, as the drum will not fall down while tilting, secondly, in the tilted position, the bottom drive with the threaded stem, as shown in Figure (4) of the Drawing Sheet No:4 of the accompanying drawings can be used for additional operations such as "Coconut Scraping". It has been found that "Coconut scraping" is much easier if it is done with the grating cone in a horizontal axis. This is achieved by the tilting facility of this "TILTING TABLE TOP WET GRINDER'. The bottom unit, consisting of the motor and the drive mechanism can be tilted and locked in any position 6:0m vertical to horizontal positions. The whole unit is supported on a steel stand, supported on rubber legs.<br>
This newly invented "TABLE TOP TILTING WET GRINDER" basically can be segregated into three segments, as shown in Figure (1) of<br><br>
ike Drawing Sheet No:l of the accompanying drawings, the top sieel drum (I) a^commodaiing the base stone and the grinding stones is the area where grinding takes place, the central housing (L) accommodating the Drive Mechanisms and the Steel Stand (O), supporting the whole unit The Steel Drum (]) houses the Stone Base (H) at its bottom and two Stone Rollers (E) are mounted on it The Unit could be locked with a Stone Lock Nut (A) placed in the Top Lid (B), Stone Holder (Q determines the position of the Roller Stones and (D) is the Centre Pin around which the grinding system rotates. The Motor (N) is fixed at the bottom side of the Metal Plate (R) as shown in the Fig. (2) of the accompanying drawings. The small puOey (0 is fixed onto the Motor Shaft to drive the bigger- pulley (K), which will revolve on the fixed pin (J). A Pinion integral of the bigger pully (K) will in turn drive the Main Ouput Gear (C), which is positioned at the centre of the product This Main gear is the ouiput gear revolving around the Centre Pin (D). This has threading. A tubular part (F^ fixed at the centre of the stone will have threadings ai the bottom which will be used to thread and lock the Drum Assembly (J) to the Bottom Unit The Complete Drive Mechanism with the Motor (N), Drive Housing (L) and cover is fixed to the stand (O), all assembled as enumerated in Future (2) of the Drawing Sheet No: 2 of the accompanying drawings. By loosening the Lock Nut (M) the whole unit can be swiveled and locked at any angular position between the vertical and horizontal positions, on either sides, as shown in Figure (3) of Drawing Sheet No: 3 ofthe Accomanying Drawings.<br>
Thus,   it  could  be seen from the above   that this newly invented 'TABLE TOP TILTIN WET GRINDER' is unique, being tiliable, table<br><br>
top model, with a vertical configuration, thereby occupying Jess space and derives mare torque than the conventional ones by using a combination of belt and gear drives, for the same power consumption. Further, the arrangement to tUt and lock the axis by 90 degrees from the vertical to horizontal positions on either sides facilitates "coconut scrapping" and similar activities to be carried out conveniently, to suit our requirements.<br><br><br><br>
I Claim,<br>
1) A 'TABLE TOP TILTING WET GRINDER', wherein the drive mechanism is a combination of a belt and gear drive, Motor (N) fixed ai one end of the bottom side of the Metal Plate (R), the Base Stone(H) positioned in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the motor and a plurality number of Rollers (E) placed above the base stone, the axis of the motor and the roller stones being perpendicular to each other, the Small Pulley (0 fixed on to the Motor Shaft to drive the Bigger Pulley (K), which revolves on the fixed pin (J); a Pinion integral of the Bigger Pully (K) in turn drives the Main Output Gear (C), which is positioned at the centre of the Grinder and revolves around the Centre Pin (D), which is also the fulcrum for the Steel Brum (I) &amp; Housing (L), placed one below the other, vertically, in that order, followed by the Steel Stand (O), the entire drive mechanism arranged within the Housing (L) in a manner that it can be swiveled and locked at at any angular position between the vertical and horizontal positions on either sides by loosening the Lock Nut (M), to facilitate the fixing of a coconut scrapper or similar device by fitting it to the Main Output Gear (G), preferably in a horizontal position.<br><br><br></td>
