[DESCRIPTION]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to mobile communication<br>
technology, and more particularly, to technology of<br>
transmitting uplink signals including ACK/NACK signals,<br>
control signals other than the ACK/NACK signals, and data<br>
signals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A user equipment (UE) of a mobile communication<br>
system transmits various signals through an uplink. Uplink<br>
signals transmitted by the user equipment can be segmented<br>
into data signals and control signals. Also, examples of<br>
the control signals transmitted to the uplink include<br>
uplink ACK/NACK signals for HARQ communication, channel<br>
quality indicator (CQI) information, and precoding matrix<br>
index (PMI).<br>
3GPP LTE system uses a single carrier frequency<br>
division multiplexing access (SC-FDMA) scheme for uplink<br>
signal transmission. Also, the 3GPP LTE system prescribes<br>
that data signals and control signals among the uplink<br>
signals are first multiplexed and ACK/NACK signals are<br>
 <br>
transmitted to the multiplexed signals by puncturing the<br>
data or control signals when uplink ACK/NACK signal<br>
transmission is required for downlink data. Hereinafter, in<br>
order that the ACK/NACK signals are divided from control<br>
signals other than the ACK/NACK signals, the control<br>
signals will mean those except for the ACK/NACK signals.<br>
Meanwhile, Athens conference (#50) for 3GPP LTE has<br>
decided that data information is rate matched together with<br>
control information when the control information is<br>
multiplexed with the data information, wherein the control<br>
information is transmitted near a reference signal. This is<br>
to improve channel estimation performance by approximating<br>
all the control signals to the reference signal as the<br>
control signals generally require higher reliability than<br>
the data signals.<br>
However, the control signals transmitted to the<br>
uplink include various signals as described above, and the<br>
ACK/NACK signals require higher reliability than the other<br>
control signals. In this case, when uplink ACK/NACK signal<br>
transmission is required while all the control signals are<br>
transmitted by approximating to the reference signal,<br>
problems occur in that the ACK/NACK signals can neither be<br>
transmitted by puncturing the control signals arranged near<br>
the reference signal nor be transmitted near the reference<br>
 <br>
signal.<br>
In this respect, a technology of transmitting uplink<br>
signals by efficiently arranging ACK/NACK signals and other<br>
control signals in a resource region considering priority<br>
among them is required.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method for transmitting uplink signals, which substantially<br>
obviates one or more problems due to limitations and<br>
disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method for transmitting uplink signals by efficiently<br>
arranging ACK/NACK signals and other control signals in a<br>
resource region considering priority among them.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
transmitting uplink signals using the aforementioned signal<br>
arrangement.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied<br>
and broadly described herein, the present invention<br>
 <br>
provides a method for transmitting uplink signals, which<br>
include ACK/NACK signals, control signals other than the<br>
ACK/NACK signals, and data signals. The method comprises<br>
serially multiplexing the control signals and the data<br>
signals; sequentially mapping the multiplexed signals<br>
within a specific resource region in accordance with a<br>
time-first mapping method, the specific resource region<br>
including a plurality of symbols and a plurality of virtual<br>
subcarriers; and arranging the ACK/NACK signals at both<br>
symbols near to symbols through which a reference signal is<br>
transmitted.<br>
At this time, the ACK/NACK signals are overwritten on<br>
a part of the multiplexed signals. And, the part of the<br>
multiplexed signals, on which the ACK/NACK signals are<br>
overwritten, includes one or more of the control signals<br>
and the data signals.<br>
Also, the method further comprises performing a<br>
discrete fourier transform (DFT) for the signals mapped on<br>
the specific resource region in a unit of each symbols of<br>
the plurality of symbols in accordance with each index of<br>
the plurality of virtual subcarriers; performing an inverse<br>
fast fourier transform (IFFT) for the DFT symbol unit<br>
signals and attaching a cyclic prefix (CP) the signals; and<br>
transmitting the symbol unit signals attached with the CP<br>
 <br>
as single carrier frequency division multiplexing access<br>
(SC-FDMA) symbols.<br>
Also, the method further comprises transmitting the<br>
signals mapped on the specific resource region through a<br>
physical uplink sharing channel (PUSCH).<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
present invention provides a method for transmitting uplink<br>
signals, which include ACK/NACK signals, control signals<br>
other than the ACK/NACK signals, and data signals. The<br>
method comprises performing channel coding for each of the<br>
data signals, the control signals, and the ACK/NACK<br>
signals; serially multiplexing the channel coded data and<br>
control signals; sequentially mapping the multiplexed<br>
signals in accordance with a time-first mapping method<br>
within a specific resource region in accordance with a<br>
time-first mapping method, the specific resource region<br>
including a plurality of symbols and a plurality of virtual<br>
subcarriers; and arranging the ACK/NACK signals at both<br>
symbols near to the symbols through which a reference<br>
signal is transmitted.<br>
At this time, the step of performing channel coding<br>
for the data signals includes attaching a CRC for a<br>
transport block (TB) to a transport block for transmission<br>
of the data signals; segmenting the transport block<br>
 <br>
attached with the CRC for the transport block in a code<br>
block unit and attaching a CRC for a code block to the<br>
segmented code block; performing channel coding for the<br>
data attached with the CRC for a code block; and performing<br>
rate matching and code block concatenation for the channel<br>
coded data.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
According to the aforementioned embodiments of the<br>
present invention, it is possible to transmit uplink<br>
signals by efficiently arranging ACK/NACK signals and other<br>
control signals in a resource region in accordance with<br>
priority among them.<br>
In addition, the ACK/NACK signals having high<br>
priority can be set in such a manner that they acquire more<br>
channel estimation effect.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the<br>
 <br>
accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that the<br>
detailed description, which will be disclosed along with<br>
the accompanying drawings, is intended to describe the<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention, and is not<br>
intended to describe a unique embodiment with which the<br>
present invention can be carried out. Hereinafter, the<br>
following detailed description includes detailed matters to<br>
provide full understanding of the present invention.<br>
However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that the present invention can be carried out without the<br>
detailed matters.<br>
Meanwhile, in some cases, to prevent the concept of<br>
the present invention from being ambiguous, structures and<br>
apparatuses of the known art will be omitted, or will be<br>
shown in the form of a block diagram based on main<br>
functions of each structure and apparatus. Also, wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings and the specification to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
As described above, the embodiment of the present<br>
invention is intended to provide a method for transmitting<br>
uplink signals by efficiently arranging ACK/NACK signals<br>
and other control signals in a resource region considering<br>
priority among them. To this end, a detailed method for<br>
 <br>
transmitting uplink signals in a 3GPP LTE system will be<br>
described.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter<br>
to describe a method for transmitting signals in accordance<br>
with a single carrier frequency division multiplexing<br>
access (SC-FDMA) scheme.<br>
As described above, a 3GPP LTE system transmits<br>
uplink signals in accordance with a single carrier<br>
frequency division multiplexing access (SC-FDMA) scheme. In<br>
detail, direct-to-parallel conversion is performed for<br>
information sequences to be transmitted, to perform a<br>
discrete fourier transform (DFT) (101). The DFT is<br>
performed for the signals converted to the parallel<br>
sequences (102), and then inverse fast fourier transform<br>
(IFFT) can be performed to obtain a single carrier feature<br>
(103). At this time, a length of information inserted to an<br>
IFFT module 103 may not be equal to a size of the IFFT<br>
module 103. However, it is required that the DFT result<br>
performed by the DFT module 102 should be mapped with<br>
continuous IFFT input indexes.<br>
Values undergone IFFT are again converted to serial<br>
signals by a parallel-to-serial conversion module 104.<br>
Afterwards, the signals are changed to a format of OFDM<br>
symbols by a cyclic prefix (CP) (105) and then transmitted<br>
 <br>
to a real time space.<br>
The aforementioned SC-FDMA scheme has advantages in<br>
that it has low peak power-to-average power ratio (PAPR)<br>
and/or cubic metric (CM) while maintaining a single carrier<br>
feature. However, in order to satisfy low PAPR/CM condition<br>
while maintaining a single carrier feature, it is required<br>
that information undergone DFT precoding should be input to<br>
the IFFT module 103 in an OFDM format by mapping with<br>
continuous indexes. In other words, it is required that DFT<br>
precoded information should be inserted to continuous<br>
subcarriers of OFDM. Accordingly, it is preferable that<br>
information data (for example, control information and data<br>
information) having different features are multiplexed<br>
together when they are transmitted to an uplink so that<br>
they undergo DFT precoding together and then are<br>
transmitted in an OFDM format.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of multiplexing data<br>
information and control information will be described.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a procedure of<br>
multiplexing data information, control information and<br>
ACK/NACK signals for uplink signal transmission.<br>
Data information multiplexed with control information<br>
is segmented into several code blocks (CB) in accordance<br>
with a size of a transport block (TB) to be transmitted to<br>
 <br>
the uplink after CRC for TB is attached to the TB (S201 and<br>
S202). Afterwards, the CRC for CB is attached to several<br>
CBs (S203), and channel coding is performed for the result<br>
value obtained by attaching the CRC for CB to several CBs<br>
(S204). Also, after the channel coded data undergo rate<br>
matching (S205), concatenation among CBs is performed<br>
(S206) . The CBs are then multiplexed with control<br>
information (S230). Meanwhile, the aforementioned steps may-<br>
be subject to channel coding chain for a data transport<br>
block.<br>
Channel coding can be performed for the control<br>
information separately from the data information (S211).<br>
The channel coded control information can later be<br>
multiplexed with the data information by a data and control<br>
channel rate mapping multiplexer (S230).<br>
Channel coding can be performed for the ACK/NACK<br>
signals separately from the data and control signals (S221).<br>
Some of the uplink signals in which the data and control<br>
signals are multiplexed (S23 0) may be transmitted to the<br>
uplink through puncturing (S240).<br>
As described above, the control information that can<br>
be transmitted together with the data information is<br>
segmented into two types, i.e., uplink (UL) ACK/NACK<br>
signals for downlink data and other control information.<br>
 <br>
The uplink ACK/NACK signals for downlink data are<br>
transmitted only when downlink data exist. A user equipment<br>
may not know whether to receive downlink data even though<br>
it should transmit the UL ACK/NACK signals. Accordingly,<br>
the user equipment segments the two types of control<br>
information from each other and transmits them to the<br>
uplink together with the data information. Hereinafter, in<br>
order to segment the ACK/NACK signals from the control<br>
signals transmitted separately from the ACK/NACK signals,<br>
"control signals" will mean those other than the ACK/NACK<br>
signals. In more detailed embodiment, the control signals<br>
may mean those other than a rank indicator as well as the<br>
ACK/NACK signals. In other words, in a specific embodiment,<br>
the control signals may include CQI and PMI. However, since<br>
the following description relates to efficient arrangement<br>
among the control signals, the data signals and the<br>
ACK/NACK signals, if the control signals are those other<br>
than the ACK/NACK signals, their detailed type will not be<br>
suggested.<br>
When the data information is transmitted to the<br>
uplink, the data information can be transmitted together<br>
with the control information. Also, ACK/NACK information<br>
can be transmitted together with the data information and<br>
the control information. Moreover, only the data<br>
 <br>
information and the ACK/NACK information can be transmitted<br>
to the uplink.<br>
Transmission information sequences obtained to<br>
transmit the data information multiplexed with the control<br>
information or the ACK/NACK information can be transmitted<br>
in accordance with the SC-FDMA scheme. At this time, the<br>
transmission information sequences can be mapped in a<br>
resource region in accordance with a time-first mapping<br>
method.<br>
For example, it is supposed that the information<br>
sequences are transmitted using one resource block, i.e.,<br>
twelve (12) OFDM subcarriers and information is transmitted<br>
through one sub-frame. Also, it is supposed that one sub-<br>
frame includes fourteen (14) SC-FDMA symbols and two of the<br>
fourteen SC-FDMS symbols are used as references signals<br>
that are pilot signals. At this time, the number of<br>
modulation symbols of the information that can be<br>
transmitted to the uplink becomes 12*12=144.<br>
144 information sequence symbols can be transmitted<br>
through 12 virtual subcarriers and 12 SC-FDMA symbols. This<br>
can be represented by a matrix structure of 12*12 called a<br>
time-frequency mapper. The information sequences to be<br>
transmitted to the uplink are mapped one by one based on<br>
the SC-FDMA symbols. This is called time-first mapping<br>
 <br>
because the SC-FDMA symbols are segmented temporally.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an example of<br>
mapping information sequences according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention in accordance with a time-first<br>
mapping method, and FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 are diagrams<br>
illustrating a method for transmitting information, which<br>
is mapped in accordance with the time-first mapping method<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 3, in accordance with the SC-FDMA<br>
scheme.<br>
The information sequences to be transmitted to the<br>
uplink can be arranged temporally in the time-frequency<br>
mapper as illustrated in FIG. 3. In other words, 12<br>
information data are mapped temporally in a first virtual<br>
subcarrier region, and then subsequent 12 information data<br>
are mapped temporally in a second virtual subcarrier region.<br>
After time-frequency mapping is performed as above,<br>
the sequences arranged on a frequency axis as illustrated<br>
in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 undergo DFT and then are inserted to a<br>
desired frequency band. Afterwards, IFFT and CP insertion<br>
are performed for each frequency region information, which<br>
can be transmitted as SC-FDMA symbols. FIG. 4 and FIG. 5<br>
illustrate a procedure of generating and transmitting the<br>
SC-FDMA symbols. FIG. 4 illustrates a case where a normal<br>
CP is used, and FIG. 5 illustrates a case where an extended<br>
 <br>
CP is used.<br>
When data are transmitted to the uplink, the control<br>
information can also be transmitted thereto. At this time,<br>
the control information and the data information are<br>
multiplexed through rate matching. However, the ACK/NACK<br>
information can be transmitted in such a manner that it is<br>
overwritten in bit streams of the data information or<br>
symbols where data information and control information are<br>
multiplexed. In this case, "overwritten" means that<br>
specific information mapped in the resource region is<br>
skipped and the corresponding region is mapped. Also,<br>
"overwritten" means that the length of the entire<br>
information is maintained equally even after specific<br>
information is inserted. This overwriting procedure may be<br>
represented by puncturing.<br>
Generally, the control information requires higher<br>
reliability than the data information. To this end, the<br>
control information should be multiplexed or inserted near<br>
the reference signal. In this case, it is possible to<br>
obtain the effect of channel estimation performance,<br>
thereby expecting improvement of performance.<br>
However, since the ACK/NACK information also requires<br>
high reliability in a receiver, if the general control<br>
information is arranged near the reference signal, priority<br>
 <br>
between the control information and the ACK/NACK signals<br>
should be considered.<br>
Accordingly, methods for multiplexing data<br>
information bit streams, control information bit streams,<br>
and ACK/NACK information sequences at different priorities<br>
will be described as various embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the control information is multiplexed serially with the<br>
data information, and is mapped with a multiplexing region<br>
in accordance with the aforementioned time-first mapping<br>
method. In this case, "multiplexed serially" means that the<br>
data information is mapped with a sequence corresponding to<br>
the multiplexed result directly after the control<br>
information is mapped with the sequence, or vice versa.<br>
Also, according to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the ACK/NACK signals are arranged to be transmitted through<br>
both symbols near a symbol through which the reference<br>
signal is transmitted.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting uplink signals in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to this embodiment, when the control<br>
information and the data information are multiplexed, they<br>
 <br>
are serially connected with each other so that they are<br>
mapped with SC-FDMS symbols in accordance with the time-<br>
first mapping method and then are transmitted to the uplink.<br>
If the ACK/NACK information should also be transmitted,<br>
among the serially multiplexed data, modulation symbols<br>
located near the reference signal are punctured so that the<br>
ACK/NACK signals are inserted thereto. In FIG. 6, a<br>
reference numeral 601 illustrates that the data and control<br>
signals are multiplexed serially if the ACK/NACK signals<br>
are not transmitted. A reference numeral 602 illustrates<br>
that the ACK/NACK signals are arranged by puncturing the<br>
multiplexed data if the ACK/NACK signals should be<br>
transmitted to the uplink. Also, a reference numeral 603<br>
illustrates that information sequences such as the<br>
reference numeral 602 are mapped in the time-frequency<br>
region in accordance with the time-first mapping method. In<br>
the reference numeral 603 of FIG. 6, it is supposed that<br>
the reference signal is transmitted through a part between<br>
symbol indexes #3 and #4 and a part between symbol indexes<br>
#9 and #10.<br>
As can be aware of it from the mapping type<br>
<br>
illustrated in the reference numeral 603 of FIG. 6, aftert<br>
the control signals are serially connected with data and<br>
then multiplexed, they are mapped in the time-frequency<br>
 <br>
region in accordance with the time-first mapping method.<br>
Also, the ACK/NACK signals can be set in such a manner that<br>
they are overwritten in the data signals multiplexed with<br>
two symbols (symbols #3, 4, 9 and 10 in FIG. 6) at both<br>
sides of the SC-FDMA symbols to which the reference signal<br>
is transmitted.<br>
FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 are diagrams illustrating a method<br>
for processing a number of ACK/NACK information data to be<br>
transmitted in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In detail, when the number of ACK/NACK information<br>
data to be transmitted is more than the number of<br>
subcarriers (of a virtual frequency region) to which data<br>
are transmitted before and after the reference signal, the<br>
ACK/NACK information can be transmitted through additional<br>
SC-FDMA symbols in addition to both symbols nearest to the<br>
reference signal. In FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, the ACK/NACK<br>
information is transmitted through additional symbols in<br>
the order of the symbols near reference symbols in addition<br>
to both symbols near the reference symbols.<br>
At this time, the SC-FDMA symbols existing based on<br>
the reference signal may not be arranged symmetrically<br>
depending on a structure of the SC-FDMA sub-frame of the<br>
uplink as illustrated in FIG. 8. Accordingly, considering<br>
 <br>
this, the ACK/NACK information should be inserted by<br>
puncturing.<br>
When the control information is arranged on the time-<br>
axis in accordance with the aforementioned embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the control information and the data<br>
information are arranged in due order so that they are<br>
mapped in the resource region. Also, if the ACK/NACK<br>
information is arranged near the reference signal, the<br>
ACK/NACK information can be overwritten in the control<br>
information as well as the data information.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating that the ACK/NACK<br>
signals are inserted by puncturing the control signals as<br>
well as the data signals in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to this embodiment, since the ACK/NACK<br>
information is substantially control information, priority<br>
is given to control information channels, so that the<br>
control information channel having the highest priority is<br>
arranged near the reference signal for protection of<br>
channel estimation while the control information channels<br>
having relatively low priority are sequentially mapped on<br>
the time axis and then transmitted. Particularly, in this<br>
embodiment, it is supposed that the ACK/NACK information<br>
has higher priority than the control information. At this<br>
 <br>
time, the control information and the data information are<br>
sequentially arranged on the time axis in accordance with<br>
the time-first mapping method and then multiplexed. The<br>
ACK/NACK information punctures the data/control information<br>
located near the reference signal.<br>
In detail, a reference numeral 901 of FIG. 9<br>
illustrates that the data and control signals are<br>
multiplexed if the ACK/NACK signals need not to be<br>
transmitted. A reference numeral 902 of FIG. 9 illustrates<br>
that data, control signals and ACK/NACK signals are<br>
multiplexed if the ACK/NACK signals should be transmitted.<br>
Also, a reference numeral 903 of FIG. 9 illustrates that<br>
the multiplexed uplink signals are mapped in the time-<br>
frequency region as illustrated in the reference numeral<br>
902.<br>
As illustrated in the reference numeral 903 of FIG. 9,<br>
it is noted from this embodiment that the ACK/NACK signals<br>
can puncture the control signals as well as the data<br>
matched near the reference signal. In this way, if resource<br>
mapping is performed by giving priority to the control<br>
signals, good channel estimation effect can be obtained as<br>
the ACK/NACK information is located near the reference<br>
signal. On the other hand, since a small number of control<br>
signals are punctured by the ACK/NACK signals, it may not<br>
 <br>
affect performance. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 9, the<br>
ACK/NACK signals may puncture the control signals/data<br>
equally distributed in the virtual frequency axis. That is,<br>
if the number of virtual subcarriers available for the<br>
above puncturing by the ACK/NACK signals is "N" and the<br>
number of ACK/NACK to be transmitted per SC-FDMA symbol is<br>
"m", the ACK/NACK signals may puncture the control<br>
signals/data equally distributed having the interval of<br>
"N/m" or equivalent.<br>
Also, since the control information and the data<br>
information are multiplexed simply, a multiplexing block<br>
can be formed simply.<br>
Hereinafter, a whole procedure of transmitting uplink<br>
signals in accordance with the aforementioned embodiments<br>
of the present invention will be described. For convenience<br>
of description, this procedure will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 2.<br>
In order to transmit the uplink signals in accordance<br>
with each of the embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
transmitter performs channel coding for each of data<br>
signals, control signals, and ACK/NACK signals. Channel<br>
coding for each of the uplink signals can be performed<br>
independently as illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
At this time, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the procedure<br>
 <br>
of performing channel coding for the data signals can<br>
include steps of segmenting a TB attached with CRC for TB<br>
in a unit of CB (S202) , attaching a CRC for CB to the<br>
segmented CBs (S203), performing channel coding for the<br>
data attached with the CRC for CB (S204) , performing rate<br>
matching for the channel coded data (S206) , and performing<br>
CB concatenation (S207).<br>
The one embodiment of the present invention suggests<br>
that the channel coded data and control signals are<br>
multiplexed serially. Serial multiplexing means that the<br>
control signals are mapped with sequential indexes directly<br>
after the data signals are mapped with them, or vice versa.<br>
Meanwhile, the multiplexed signals can sequentially be<br>
mapped within a specific resource region in accordance with<br>
the time-first mapping method, wherein the specific<br>
resource region includes a plurality of symbols (for<br>
example, 12 SC-FDMA symbols) and a plurality of virtual<br>
subcarriers.<br>
In addition, in this embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the ACK/NACK signals are preferably arranged<br>
near the symbols to which the reference signal is<br>
transmitted, among the plurality of symbols.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
the present invention can be embodied in other specific<br>
 <br>
forms without departing from the spirit and essential<br>
characteristics of the invention. Thus, the above<br>
embodiments are to be considered in all respects as<br>
illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the<br>
invention should be determined by reasonable interpretation<br>
of the appended claims and all change which comes within<br>
the equivalent scope of the invention are included in the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
