"A PROCESS FOR THE MELT SPINNING OF ONE OR MORE<br>
THERMOPLASTICS"<br>
E.I.DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OK THE INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastics may be melt spun at exceptionally high speeds, while maintaining desirable properties that arc obtained at lower spinning speeds, by adding a small amount of a liquid crystalline polymer containing repeat units derived from specified monomers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
fibers made from thermoplastics, both natural and synthetic, are important items of commerce. These fibers are used for apparel, luggage, thread, and industrial uses. Oftentimes these fibers arc formed by melt spinning, that is by melting the thermoplastic, forcing (extruding) the molten polymer through a small orifice (spinneret), cooling, and then using that cxtrudate. perhaps after having undergone other treatments such as drawing, as a fiber, see for example II. Mark, ct al.. Ed . Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 6. John Wilcv &amp; Sons. New York. 1986. p. 802-839. and W. Gerhartz. et al.. lid.. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. 5"' Ed.. Vol. AIO, VCII Verlagsgesellschtr   mb 1 Weinherein. 1987.p.511-566 Many important types of fibers are spun in this way. for example polvesters. polyaniidcs (nylons), and polyolclins.<br>
Melt spinning technology is relatives   mature, and in recent years improvements have centered around producing higher quality more consistent fibers, and in improving the productivity of spinning equipment to lower spinning costs One wav to accomplish the latter is to increase spinning speeds, i.e.. increase the lenuth of fiber produced per unit time at constant dpi" through a spinneret hole. This has been accomplished partly by improving the spinning machines themselves, lot example by modifying the vvindup part of the machines to increase the speed at which the fiber can be wound onto a bobbin. Very  high vvindup speeds (VVl 'S). for example 6,000 m minute, can be obtained on some spinning machines.<br>
However, it has been found that often when fiber is spun at vcrv high speeds, the properties of the fiber arc different from those of fibers spun at lower speeds   In many cases the properties of the fiber spun ai high speed arc poorer for certain uses than those spun at lower speeds, and so the   pinning speed may be limited not by<br><br>
Equipment limitations, but on the properties needed in the fiber obtained   Therefore methods of obtaining higher WUS (which is the actual speed of production ot the fiber  without substantially deleterously affecting the fiber properties are desired<br>
The effects of changing spinning speeds arc varied. For instance in U.S. Patent 4,442.057 at  column 1, lines 7-33, to it is stated<br>
Some preliminary molecular orientation is induced in the fibers during melt spinning and this is increased by drawing to the degree required for any given fiber product. Drawing may be operated as a completely separate process after winding up and storing spun filaments or it may immediately follow spinning by forwarding spun filaments directly at controlled speed to a drawing process without interruption, or it may be still more closely integrated with spinning by omitting even intermediate speed control between spinning and drawing as for example in British Pat. No. 1,487.843.<br>
                     Increasing the spinning speed increases the production rate but also<br>
increases the preliminary orientation therehy reducing the extensibility of the filaments and the extent to which they can be drawn. This has various disadvantages in different contexts In certain speed ranges it can result in unacceptable product variability at otherwise practicable speeds: in processes aimed at very high tenacity filaments it can reduce the tenacity achievable: and in spin-lag-draw processes the reduction in subsequent draw ratio reduces the decitex required at spinning, partially offsetting the production rate advantage of the higher spinning speed. Various means have been proposed to mitigate these disadvantages in the manufacture ol" fibers of polyethylene terephihalaie by suppressing the preliminary orientation induced at spinning." I ligher WUS also can lead to shorter elongations to break, higher tensile Modulus at lower elongations (say 50 or 100%. any or all of which are disadvantageous in some applications.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE Figure 1 shows a quench apparatus used in spinning the fiber of Examples 17-22 and Comparative Examples N-P herein.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The LCPs used herein are described in U.S. Patent 5,525,700, and methods of making such polymers are described therein. The molar ratio of repeat units (IA) to (IB) to (IG) ranges from 0:0:100 to 0:100:0 to 100:0:0. Preferably, repeat units (LA) and (LB) are present, with the molar ratio of (IA) to (LB) ranging from about 1:99 to about 99:1. In a preferred LCP, repeat units (IA) and (LB) are present, with, the molar ratio of (LA) to (LB) ranging from about 75:25 to about 25:75, and/or the molar ratio of (n):(in) ranges from about 30:70 to about 85:15, and/or the molar ratio of (1V):(V) is from about 50:50 to about 90:10, and/or the number of moles of (IV) plus (V), per 100 moles of (I), ranges from about 200 to about 500.<br><br>
and/or the number of  moles of(IV) plus (V). per 100 moles of(I). ranges from about 200 to about 500.<br>
It is understood by the artisan that in order to readily form high molecular weight I.CP, the molar ratio of the diols [i.e.. (1A). (IB) and/or (IC)1 to the diacids [i.e., (II) and (IIIA) and/or (II1B)| present in the polymerization of monomers to form an LCP should be about 1:1. Small deviations from this ratio arc not critical, but large deviations are normally to be avoided, since it usually prevents or slows polymerization to relatively high molecular weight.<br>
The process of the invention is suited to the melt spinning of fiber-forming thermoplastic polymers such as polyesters, polyamides, copolyesters. copolyamides or polyolefins. for example poly^etliyleiie terephthalatc) and its copolyesters. polycaprolactam, poly(hexamethylcnc adipamide), polypropylene, polvctlnlenc. acrylic polymers, vinyl chloride and vinylidene-chloride-based polymers, polvsivrene. polyphenylcne oxide/poly sty rene blends, polysulphoncs and polyethcrsulfones, polyketones and polyetherkctones, polyfluoroolefins, polyoxymethylcnes. thcrmoplastic cellulosic polymers, and other biologically produced polymers, such as poly(hydroxybutyrate). Preferred thermoplastics are polyesters such as poly(1.3-propylene terephthalatc). poly(ethylcne tcrephthalate) (PET), and poly( 1.4-butylenc terephthalatc). and polyamides such as polyhexamcthylene adipamide (nylon-6.6) and polycaprolactam (nylon-6).<br>
Preferably the mixture of the LCP and the thermoplastic contains about *&gt;').5 to about ()5 percent hv weight of the thermoplastic and about 0.5 to about 5.0 percent by weight of the LCP   The polymer mixture and the resulting fiber nun also contain the usual amounts of other materials found in thermoplastic fibers, such as pigment*-, dyes, antioxidants, lubricants.'antistatics, antimicrobials, and flame retardent;.   I'he mixture of the LCP and thermoplastic may be made by a number of standard methods, for example they may be melt mixed in a single or twin screw extruder, formed into pellets, and then be remeltcd for melt spinning. Or a mixture of LCP and thermoplastic particles may be made by pellet blending and then melt mixed in a before being melt spun, in other words the melt mixing may take place in the melting step for melt spinning.  It is preferred that the blend of the LCP and thermoplastic be relatively uniform, so that consistent quality fiber may be produced, and thus<br><br>
preferred that melt mixing lake place under the relatively high shear conditions found in melt polymer apparatus such as single and twin screw extruders   As described in I IS. Patent 4,518,744 it is preferred if the LCP has a panicle size in the inch ol about 0.5 to 3 j.im prior to the actual spinning of the fiber.<br>
The melt spinning is carried out under conditions that are normal for melt spinning the thermoplastic being used, except that higher fiber produciion speeds may be used. By fiber produciion speed is meant the final length of fiber produced per unit time, synonymous herein with WUS. The normal spinning temperature of a thermoplastic will usually be above Us glass transition temperature and melting point (if it has a melting point), but below a temperature at which sufficient thermal degradation takes place to affect fiber properties significantly. At whatever the spin temperature used is, the I.CI* should be melt processible, that is molten, at that temperature. An advantage of the present LCPs is that by varying their composition within the limits described above, l.CPs with a wide range of melting points can be made. Thus both the thermoplastic and LCP used should be melt processible at the spinning temperature.<br>
The WUS is about 1000 m/min or more, preferably about 2000 m/min or more, and especially preferably about 3000 m/min or more.<br>
Using the LCI's described herein higher production speeds are possible than with other l.CI*rwhile maintaining good fiber properties and/or being able to use lesser amounts of LCP to<ihtatrrt1lintatp7oliuetion rates. since lci arc generalk more expensive than most thermoplastics used for fibers this is an advantage at lower-lci amounts there also less risk the lcp will adversely affect other fiber properties such as dyeabilily. lxamples herein demonstrate unexpected advantages of current lcps over l.cps in high speed spinning thermoplastics.></ihtatrrt1lintatp7oliuetion>
It is known that when the spinning speed of poly(ethylene lerephlhalalel (PI  I ) or nylon-66 libers increases either at constant melt throughput per spmneiet hole oi at constant deelex per filament the % elongatioii-lo-break of the fibers or the draw loree required to draw the yarn under some specified conditions increases due to the higher molecular orientation of the yarn.  Yet, it is desirable to be able to spin at higher speeds without altering the % elongation-to-break or the draw tension of the yarn<br><br>
because this higher spinning productivity reduces (he cost of fiber manufacture.   I he following Examples illustrate this type of information.<br>
In the Examples the following abbreviations are used: H - elongation at break<br>
CEOTH. CO - LCI's used in U.S. Patent 4.442,057 IM - productivity increase WUS - windup speed<br>
An InstronÂ® Tester was used for testing tensile properties of the fibers, and the gauge length used was 10.16 cm and the strain rate was 25% per minute.<br>
The draw tension, in grams, was measured at a draw ratio of I 7X. and at a heater temperature of 180"C.  Draw tension was used as a measure of orientation. Draw tension was measured on an apparatus equivalent to a DTI 400 Draw Tension Instrument, available from Eenzing Technik. Normally an increase in the withdrawal or windup speed is accompanied by an increase in the draw tension and a reduction in the elongation, which can be undesirable, whereas we have achieved increases in the withdrawal speed at constant decitex per filament without increasing the draw tension<br>
In all of the Examples the I.CP polymer used had the same composition as the polymer made in Example 6 of M.S. Patent 5.525.700.<br>
Examples l-Â° and Comparative Example A-F<br>
Pellets of the I.CP (where used) and a commercial grade polytcllnlene terephthalate) were compounded in a Baker-Perkins twin-screw extruder. The diameter of the screw flight was 4.021 cm (I .Â°o75 in) and the screws operated at 100 rpm. The feed /.one ofthc extruded was at 2.WC. and the barrel temperatures were 230oC 270oC and 290oC. At the end ofthc extruder a spinning block was attached which housed a melt filter-pack and a spinneret plate with 34 holes.   The mell spinning temperatures are reported in fable I    The diameter of each hole was 0.38 mm (0.01 5 in) and the melt throughput was 40 g per hour per hole. The freshly spun filaments were cooled in ambient air without any forced air flow or any special quenching apparatus   The cooled filaments, after finish application, were wound up at 1000, 2000 and 4000 m/min. The throughput per hole remained constant and. consequently, finer filaments were produced as the windup speed increased.   The intrinsic viscosity of the control PET after spinning was 0.65. These results as well as<br><br>
the productivity increase in each are shown in Table 1.   I he data labeled "Brody   inc taken from Table I of M.S. Patent 4,442,057, and show that the present I.CP is superior to the I.CP used in Table I of this issued patent.   I'he productivity  increase was computed using the formula shown at column 4, line 55 of U.S Patent 4,442.057 The throughput was 0.666 grams per minute per hole in all cases. The dpf was 6.0 (6.67 decitex per filament) at 1000 m/min and it decreased as the speed increased.<br>

In operation a molten polymer was metered into the spinning pack 16 and extruded as filaments 20. The filaments were pulled from the spinneret into a path by withdrawal roll 34 finish is applied ahove roll 34. Yarn was wound up at 4118. 4575. 5032 and 5490 m/min.  fable 3 summarizes the draw tension for the control nylon-66 fibers as well as for the blend of nylon-66 with 0.5 weight % of LCP HX-8000-270.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
from Tabic 3 it is evident that the LCP blend yields fibers that have the same draw tension and, expcctedly. other properties, such as % elongation-to-break, at much higher speeds,  f or example, the control gives a draw tension of 86 I grams at 3385 m/min and 110.5 grams at 41 I 8 m/min. whereas the blend gives the same draw tensions at 4823 m/min and 5627 n2min respectively. Since the decitex per filament is the same in all cases, this increase in spinm ig speed translates to (4823-3385)x[00/3385=42.5%. and (F627-41 IKlxfK)'4( (8 = 37.7% melt flow rate or productivity increase respectively. This is a wry significant increase produced by adding only 0.5% of the additive.  In contrast  in I '.S. Patent 4,442.057 in Kamples 5. 6 and 7 in lable 4 using nylon-6.6 as the thcnnoplastic. lower productivih increases by adding 12 times more LCP. i.e.. 6% of \'7
