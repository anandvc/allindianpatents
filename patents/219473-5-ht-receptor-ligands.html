THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
PRESSURE SENSING DEVICE WITH MOISTURE FILTER<br><br>
ENDRESS+HAUSER  GMBH+CO.  KG  of  HAUPTSTRASSE  1, MAULBURG, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br><br>
79689<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br>
2003<br><br>
The invention generally relates to housings or devices with moisture sensitive components, such as e.g. 5 housings with moisture sensitive electronic circuitry or measuring devices with moisture sensitive sensors. This group of devices especially comprises relative pressure sensors.<br>
10 Relative pressure sensors can be used to measure pressures of media, for example of liquids, gases or vapors, with respect to the currently prevailing atmospheric or ambient pressure, this atmospheric or ambient  pressure  therefore  serving  as  a  reference<br>
15 pressure. In this context, the humidity of the reference air has proven to be a problem, since the humidity can penetrate into the sensor via a reference pressure line and can condense out at temperatures which lie below the dew point. Therefore, there have<br>
20 been extensive efforts to prevent the moisture from penetrating into the sensor.<br>
By way of example, Japanese patent application No. 07110364  has  disclosed  a  capacitive  relative<br>
25 pressure sensor with a base body and a diaphragm which is connected, along its edge region, in a pressure-tight manner to the base body, so as to form a reference pressure chamber. The , reference air is introduced into the reference pressure chamber through<br>
30 a reference pressure line and a bore. In the reference pressure line there is a water absorber which is intended to dry the reference air.<br>
This solution is unsatisfactory to the extent that the 35 moisture content in the absorber is enriched. When the absorber is saturated, or when the temperature rises and some of the bound water can be desorbed again, moisture passes into the sensor.<br>
2<br><br>
The European patent application which bears the publication number 974 825 A2 follows a different approach. The structure of the relative pressure sensor 5 is generally as described above, but a hydrophobic filter element is used instead of the absorber, this element being held at a temperature which the temperature inside the sensor never falls below and its preferably significantly colder than the temperatures<br>
10 in the interior of the sensor. In this way, moisture condenses out at the filter element when the filter temperature falls below the dew point of the warmer ambient air. Therefore, the air which enters the interior of the sensor only has a water content which<br>
15 corresponds to a relative atmospheric humidity of 100% at the filter temperature. However, since the temperature inside the sensor never falls below the filter temperature and is generally in fact above the filter temperature,  there is no possibility of the<br>
20 moisture condensing in the interior of the sensor, since the dew point is not reached.<br>
The required cooling of the filter element is achieved, for example  in  sensors  for  the  food  industry,  by<br>
25 keeping the filter element in thermal contact with the cold, process medium via the sensor housing. The device described is advantageous to the extent that the saturation problems which arise with an absorber do not occur.<br>
30<br>
On the other hand, the need to control the temperature of the filter element entails significant design limitations which are unacceptable for certain applications.<br>
35<br>
Moreover, the user is subject to restrictions in terms of operation and maintenance of the pressure-measuring<br>
3<br><br>
device. By way of example, if the filter element were to be heated, during cleaning operations, to temperatures which lie above the normal operating temperature in the interior of the sensor, it would be 5 possible for air with a high level of humidity to penetrate into the sensor, and this moisture could then condense at normal operating temperature.<br>
For similar reasons, the above filter elements or 10 absorbers are unsuitable for other devices with moisture sensitive components which require a gas exchange with the ambient for the purpose of cooling or pressure adjustment. This especially applies, if changes of the ambient temperature with associated 15 changes of the reative humidity must be expected. Such moisture sensitive components may be, for instance, electronic circuits.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object 20  of providing a device with a filter element which overcomes the problems described.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by the relative pressure sensor according to the 25 independent patent claim 1, and by the device according to independent patent claim 8. Further advantages and aspects of the invention arc given in the dependent claims, the description and the drawings.<br>
30 The device comprises a housing which defines a chamber-in its interior which comprises at least one aperture through, which the chamber is in fluid communication with the environment of the housing by means of a gas exchange path; and a filter element disposed in the gas<br>
35 exchange path, said the filter element comprising a hydrophobic and/or hydrophobicized, nanoporous material.<br>
4<br><br>
An especially preferred embodiment the chamber comprises an inlet aperture and an outlet aperture, through which the chamber is in fluid communication with the environment of the chamber by means of 5 respective gas exchange paths, wherein a respective filter element is provided in both gas exchange paths, said filterelements comprising a hydrophobic and/or hydrophobicized, nanoporous material<br>
10 The device is especially suitble as housing for electronic circuitry. Optionally, an airflow can be guided through the chamber by means of a conventional ventilator, therby enabling an effective heat exchange.<br>
15 The relative pressure sensor according to the invention for capturing a measured pressure with respect Lo a reference pressure comprises:<br>
a sensor element having<br>
^    a base body/and<br>
a measurement diaphragm which,	along its edge<br>
region,  is  connected  in  a	pressure-tight<br>
25	manner to the base body so	as to form a<br>
reference pressure chamber,<br>
the  measurement  diaphragm  having  a  first<br>
diaphragm surface, which faces away from the<br>
30	reference pressure chamber and can be exposed<br>
to the measured pressure, and a second diaphragm surface, which faces the reference pressure chamber;<br>
35 a reference pressure path which extends between a surface which can be exposed to the reference pressure and an opening in the reference pressure<br><br>
chamber, with the result that the second diaphragm surface can be exposed to the reference pressure; and<br>
5       a  filter  element  which  is  arranged  in  the reference pressure path;<br>
wherein<br>
10       the filter element comprises a hydrophobic and/or hydrophobicized, nanoporous material.<br>
The nanoporous material is preferably arranged as a layer on a porous support material or is embedded in 15 the matrix of a porous support material, the support material serving in particular to ensure the required mechanical stability.<br>
The nanoporous material preferably comprises an 20 inorganic material, in particular a ceramic material, Al2o3 or Ti02 being preferred. ZrC&gt;2,  aluminosilicates, aluminum beryllium silicates; apatite, cordierite, mullite, zeolite, SiC and  carbon, Vycor Glass and their mixtures are in principle 25  also suitable.<br>
In this context, the term "nanoporous" refers to a pore size distribution whose maximum, based on the pore frequency, lies at a pore diameter of less than 4" nm, 30 preferably less than 2.5 nm, more preferably between 0.4 and 2 nm, even more preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 nm, and particularly preferably between 0.7 and 1 nm. In a particularly preferred exemplary embodiment, the distribution maximum is approximately 0.9 nm.<br>
35<br>
The preferred production process  using the sol gel process can be used to achieve a sufficiently narrow<br><br>
pore size distribution which ensures a uniform filter action. The maximum pore diameter should preferably be no more than 10 nm, more preferably no more than 5 nm, even more preferably no more than 2 nm. 5<br>
The terms microporous and mesoporous are also customarily used in filtration technology to describe layers with pore sizes in the nanometer range. According  to  this  technology,  what  are  known  as<br>
10 mesoporous layers have pore diameters of between 2 nm and 50 nm, while what are known as microporous layers have pore diameters of less than 2 nm. In the context of these definitions, the nanoporous material used in the invention is to be classified in the microporous<br>
15 range or at the lower end of the mesoporous range. In the text which follows, the term "nanoporous" will continue to be used in connection with the materials used according to the invention.<br>
20  The layer thickness of the nanoporous material may in<br>
each case be adapted to the desired filter action,<br>
which is dependent on the pore size distribution and<br>
 the  hydrophobic  properties.   The  layer  must  be<br>
sufficiently thick, so that there are no defects in the<br>
25  material which would endanger the filter action.<br>
On the other.hand, it is recommended for the nanoporous layer to be as thin as possible, in order to minimize the  flow  resistance  for  the  gases  which are  to be<br>
30 allowed to pass through, for example N2 or O2. Finally, the surface of the filter element is to be designed in such a way that, with the flow resistance per unit area which is present on account of the reguired filter action, it is possible to achieve sufficiently rapid<br>
35 pressure compensation through the filter element in the event of pressure pulses.<br>
7<br><br>
Typical conductivities for gaseous media in the case of filter   elements   with   nanoporous   layers   are approximately 20 to 800 mm3/(cm2s bar), preferably 20 to 200 mm3/(cm2s bar) . 5<br>
The layer thickness of the nanoporous material is preferably at least 20 nm, more preferably at least 40 nm, and particularly preferably at least 80 nm. The layer thickness of the nanoporous material is 10 preferably no more than 4 jam, more preferably no more than 2 jam, even more preferably no more than 1 jam, and particularly preferably no more than 0.5 jam.<br>
Particularly in the case of applications which involve 15 considerable temperature fluctuations, the support material for the nanoporous layer should preferably have the same thermal expansion behavior as the filter material, in order to minimize the mechanical stress on the filter material. However, the importance of this 20 requirement decreases as the layer thickness of the nanoporous material falls.<br>
Layer systems with 2, 3 or more chemically and/or morphologically different Layers are also suitable for 25 implementing the invention. In this context, preference is given to layer systems in which layers with stepped pore sizes follow one another, the layer systems having at least one layer of nanoporous material.<br>
30 In a preferred group of filter elements, these elements have a layer structure with a nanoporous layer of TiO2 with a mean pore size of approximately 0.7 to 1.2 nm, preferably approximately 0.9 nm, the nanoporous layer having a mean thickness of between 30  and 100 nm,<br>
35 preferably between 40 and 70 nm, particularly preferably between 45 and 55 nm. The nanoporous layer described  is  applied  to  a  ceramic  middle  layer,<br>
9<br><br>
weight, preferably approximately 0.5 - 10% by weight, particularly preferably 0.5 - 5% by weight, have proven suitable for the hydrophobicizing.<br>
5  In principle, any desired hydrophobic substances, such<br>
as  waxes,   aliphatic  and  aromatic  hydrocarbons,<br>
silicones and silicone resins, are suitable. Preference<br>
is given, inter alia, to organosilanes, in particular<br>
, silanes of the formula Ry-Si-X4-y,  where R denotes a<br>
10 hydrophobic radical, X denotes a hydrolyzable group and 1 
15<br>
The impregnation is promoted by an open porosity with pore widths which allow the 'carrier medium and the hydrophobicizing agent to penetrate. Layers which have not completely solidified and the structure of which<br>
20  swells during the impregnation step are also suitable.<br>
Further details about hydrophobic coatings have been published, for example, in the British patent application GB 2 014 868 A.<br>
25<br>
Moreover, hydrophobic material can also be deposited on a nanoporous layer by vapor deposition, in order to hydrophobicize this layer. Vapor deposition is particularly suitable if solvents impair the coating<br>
30  operation.<br>
As an alternative to the subsequent impregnation of the filter material with a hydrophobic solution, it is also possible for a hydrophobic substance to be admixed with 35 the starting materials. Examples of such 'substances are organic/inorganic hybrid materials, such as ormocers (a contraction of organic modified ceramics). Examples OF<br>

the invention will now be described with reference to the appended drawings, in which:<br>

Fig. 3 shows the step response of a relative pressure sensor with filter according to the invention to a pressure pulse compared to the step response of a relative pressure sensor without<br>

Fig. 4 shows a housing according to the present invention for electronic circuitry<br>
20<br>
The relative pressure sensor according to the invention comprises a housing 10, in the interior of which a sensor element 20 which is preferably of cylindrical structure is arranged.<br>
25<br>
The sensor element comprises a base body 26, which is donnected in a pressure-tight manner to a measurement diaphragm 21, a reference pressure chamber 22 being formed  between  the  measurement  diaphragm.  A  first<br>
30 diaphragm surface faces away from the base body 26 and can be exposed to a measurement pressure which can be introduced into a cavity 12 in the housing through a connection 11. The cavity is delimited by the measurement diaphragm 21, an annular seal 13 preferably<br>
35 being clamped axially between a stop face of the housing and the measurement diaphragm 21, in order to seal the cavity.<br>
II<br>
The pressure-dependent deformation of the measurement diaphragm 21 is detected by suitable means, for example capacitively, resistively or inductively, and is 5 converted into a measurement signal which is removed from the housing via a line 27. Details of the way in which these measurement principles are implemented are common knowledge to the person skilled in the art and require no further explanation here.<br>
10<br>
The second diaphragm suriace, which faces the base body 26, of the measurement diaphragm. 21 can be exposed to the reference pressure, which is introduced into the reference pressure chamber 22 via a reference pressure<br>
15  line 23.<br>
The reference pressure line 23 is preferably guided radially out of the housing 10 and opens out in a filter chamber 24 which has an opening 25 leading to<br>
20 ambient air. A diaphragm-like filter element 30, which takes up the entire cross-sectional area of the filter chamber 24, is arranged in the filter chamber 24. In its edge region, the filter element is connected in a gastight manner to the filter chamber, so that all the<br>
25 gas has to be transferred through the surface of the diaphragm-like filter element.<br>
The filter chamber preferably has a cover with a gas inlet,  in order to protect the filter element from<br>
30 mechanical damage. Although other arrangements of the filter element are conceivable, it is in principle advisable for the filter element to be designed so that it is protected from mechanical loads. Equally, the filter  element  is  to  be  protected  from  aggressive<br>
35 reagents, if the relative.pressure sensor according to the invention is to be used in the vicinity of such substances.<br>
22<br><br>
The pore size distribution of the filter element with a mean pore size of 0.9 nm is illustrated in fig. 2. On account of the very narrow pore size distribution, a 15 homogeneous filter action is to be expected for the entire filter element.<br>
To check whether a filter element impairs the start-up performance of the relative pressure sensor according<br>
20 to the invention, a relative pressure sensor with a nominal pressure range of 400 rnbar was exposed to an overload pressure of 6 bar. The step response alter the pressure had been relieved as quickly as possible was measured in each case with a filter element and without<br>
25 a filter element. Vn this embodiment, the relative pressure sensor had an internal volume of approximately 20 mm3 without the application of pressure. The internal volume when pressure was applied with an overload was approximately 7 mm3,  meaning thai; a gas<br>
\3<br>
volume of approximately 13 mm3 at standard pressure had to flow through the filter element in order to reach the equilibrium state after the pressure relief. Representative results of the measurements are shown in 5 fig. 3, in which the top curve in the top diagram shows the step response with a filter and the bottom curve in the top diagram shows the step response without a filter. The bottom diagram superimposes the two curves, the two curves running substantially identically. It 10 follows from this that the step response of the filter alement is practically unimpaired.<br>
The start-up time with and without filter element was 210 ms, the output signal after this start-up time 15 being in an error band of ± 0.25%. It was impossible to detect any lag effects over a measurement. time of approximately 10 sec.<br>
Consequently, the measurement accuracy and the start-up 20  time of the relative pressure sensor in response to pressure fluctuations are not impaired in any way by the filter element.<br>
Duriing the production of the relative pressure sensor 25 according to the invention, it should be ensured that the reference pressure chamber 24 is absolutely dry, since moisture contained in the reference pressure chamber would be unable to escape on account of the filter function. 30<br>
The sensor element of the relative pressure sensor according to the invention may in particular be a capacitive, resistive or inductive sensor element, but the invention can be implemented with any sensor 35 element irrespective of the measurement principle selected.<br><br><br>
In principle,, any desired arrangements are possible for the relative pressure sensor. For example, the first diaphragm surface of the measurement diaphragm may be brought into direct contact with the medium to be measured, or alternatively it is possible to provide a separating body with a separating diaphragm, in which case the separating diaphragm comes into contact with the medium to be measured and the pressure which i: present at the measurement diaphragm is hydraulically 10 transferred to the first diaphragm surface of the measurement diaphragm. The measures required for this purpose are well known to the person skilled in the art and do not require extensive explanation here.<br>
15 Finally,. Fig. 4 shows a housing for electronic circuitry 40 which defines a chamber 41 in its interior. The chamber comprises a first aperture 42 and a second aperture 43, through which the chamber  communicates with the environment of the housing. 20 Filter elements 44, 45 are placed in the first aperture 42 and the second aperture 43, respectively, wherein said filter elements comprise a hydrophobic and/or hydrophobicized, nanoporous membrane. Regarding the details of the filter elements, reference is made to<br>
25 the above description of the filter elements for relative pressure sensors according to the present invention. The filter elements described in that context are suitable for the housing for electronic circuitry according to the present invention without<br>
30  any restriction<br>
A ventilator may be provided optionally to increase the gas flow through the chamber 41. This might be necessary if the heat dissipated from electronic 35 circuitry (not shown) cannot be removed sufficiently by thermal convection.<br>
15<br><br>
Further aspects regarding the dimensions of the filter elements for a given volume of the housing or a required cooling rate are easily derivable for a person skilled in the art, without any further detailed 5  discussion. <br>
