PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING OLEFIN POLYMERS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
5	Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates to olefin polymerisation. In particular, the present invention<br>
	concerns a process and an apparatus for continuous polymerisation olefin monomers like<br>
	ethylene and other monomers in a cascade of polymerisation reactors, wherein an olefin<br>
10	 monomer is polymersed first in shurry phase in an inlet hydrocarbon diluent in at least one<br>
	loop reactor and then, subsequently, in gas phase in at least one gas phase reactor.<br>
	Description of Related Art<br>
15 	The loop reactor was developed in the 1950's. It is now widely used for the production of<br>
	polyethylene and other olefin polymers. In a loop reactor, ethylene is polymerised in the<br>
	presence of a hydrocarbon diluent in slurry phase at elevated pressure and temperature. The<br>
	slurry is withdrawn from the reactor and concentrated so that the solids content at the reactor<br>
	outlet is higher than the solids, content in the reactor. Traditionally, this has been done by<br>
20	 using settling legs. However, present methods for concentrating the polymer slurry of a loop<br>
	reactor have been unsatisfactory. This is true, in particular, for the production of bimodal<br>
	polyethylene in cascaded reactors.<br>
	Bimodal polyethylene comprises at least one low molecular weight component and at least<br>
25	 one high molecular weight component It can be produced in a cascade of reactors, which<br>
	means that polymerisation is carried out in a plurality of reactors placed in serial arrangement<br>
	so that the polymerisation product withdrawn from the product cutlet of one reactor is fed into<br>
	the inlet of the following reactor. When using cascaded polymerisation reactors, it is<br>
	important to prevent the flow of certain reactants from one polymerisation stage to the new. if<br>
30	 the low molecular weight polymer component is produced in the first polymerisation stage,<br>
	any carryover of hydrogen from the first stage to the second stage will reduce the molecular<br>
	weight produced in the second stage, thereby leading to reduced mechanical properties and<br>
	inferior meit strength of the final polymer. On the other hand, if the high molecular weight<br>
	component is produced in the first reactor, then carryover of comonorners into the second<br><br><br>
2<br>
	polymerisation stage will have a negative impact on the mechanical properties of the final<br>
	polymer.<br>
	The use of hydrocyclones for concentrating the outlet slurry of a loop reactor is known since<br>
5	 the 1960's. Loop reactors equipped with a hydrocyclone are disclosed in, e.g., US 3 816 383,<br>
	where a part of the underflow from the hydrocyclone is taken to product recovery, while the<br>
	residual pan is combined with the overflow and returned to the loop reactor.<br>
	Another document relating to the above-mentioned topic is US 4 395 523, which discloses a<br>
10	 method of making and recovering polymer particles. The known method comprises<br>
	polymerising in a loop reactor, directing a portion of the recirculating polymer slurry into a<br>
	hydroeyclone, returning the overflow from the hydrocyclone into the reactor and withdrawing<br>
	the underflow from the hydrocyclone and conducting it to product recovery.<br>
15 	Further.EPl 113624.EP1 118625andEPl118626 disclose a process for polymerismg<br>
	olefin, where the polymer slurry is directed from a loop reactor into a hydrocyclone. The<br>
	underflow from the hydrocyclone is directed either to a subsequent polymerisation stage or to<br>
	produet recovery.<br>
20 	EP 891 990 discloses an ethylene polymerisation process comprising a continuous take-off of<br>
	polymer slurry. The polymer shurry is continuously withdrawn from the loop reaccor and fed<br>
	to a high-pressure flash. From the high-pressure flash, the polytmer is transferred into a low--<br>
	pressure flash and from there to product recovery.<br>
25 	EP 517 868 discloses a process for producing ethylene polymers in a reactor cascade<br>
	comprising a loop reactor and a gas phase reactor. The document docs not disclose how the<br>
	polymer slurry is withdrawn from the loop reactor. Hydrocarbons are separated from the<br>
	polymer, but no details are given on how this is done. Finally, the polymer is fed into the gas<br>
	phase reactor.<br>
30<br>
	Even if the above documents describe different methods of withdrawing the slurry from the<br>
	loop reactor, none of them discloses or suggests a suitable, cost efficient process for<br>
	polymerising ethylene in two successive stages, the first stage being conducted in a loop<br>
	reactor and the second stage in a gas phase reactor. The polymer is separated from the<br><br><br>
3<br>
	reaction mixture after the loop polymerisation stage and at least a part. of the hydrocarbon<br>
	mixture is removed.. Then essentially no hydrogen is tarried over to the gas-phase<br>
	polymerisation reactor.<br>
5 	The process of EP 517 868 comprises a low-pressure flash after the loop reactor for<br>
	separating the polymer from the reaction mixture. While this provides effective separation, it<br>
	is a relatively expensive process, because the overhead flow from the flash needs to be<br>
	compressed before it can be returned into [he loop reactor and the polymer must be fed into<br>
	the gas phase reactor with e.g. a pressuring/depress ring sequence.<br>
10<br>
	One way of overcoming the above-mentioned problem involving the necessity of<br>
	compressing the overhead flow from the flash, would be to replace the low-pressure flash of<br>
	EP 517 868 with a high-pressure flash, as suggested in EP 891 990. However, if the slurry<br>
	were withdrawn from the reactor continuously, as proposed in EP 891 990, the separation of<br>
15	 the reactants would not be sufficiently efficient and, in particular, some hydrogen would be<br>
	carried over from the loop reactor to the gas phase reactor, thus limiting the molecular weight<br>
	that could be produced in the gas phase reactor. The use of a combination of a high-pressure<br>
	flash and a low-pressure flash would result in an expensive process. Finally, if the polymer<br>
	slurry were withdrawn from the loop reactor intermittently by using setting legs and the thus<br>
20	 withdrawn concentrated slurry would be conducted to a high-pressure flash, there would still<br>
	remain the problem with high hydrogen concentration in the gas. However, the flash would<br>
	now have to be designed for a high flow, because the flow rates are high at the times when the<br>
	settling legs open to discharge the slurry. This overdesign and use of settling legs leads to a<br>
	high investment cose.<br>
25<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
	It is an aim at the present invention ID eliminate the problems of the prior art and to provide a<br>
	novel way of polymerising ethylene and other olefin monomers, optionally in me presence of<br>
	It is a particular aim of the present invention to find an economical alternative to file process<br>
	known from EP 517 868 by providing a novel and cost-efficient process for polymerising<br>
	ethylene in two successive stages, the first stage being conducted in a loop reactor and the<br><br>
4<br>
	second stage in a gas phase reactor, where the polymer is separated from the reaction mixture<br>
	after the loop polymerisation stage so that no reactant, especially no hydrogen, is transferred,<br>
	from the loop reactor to the gas phase reactor in such an extent that it would have an adverse<br>
	effect in the polymerisation in gas phase.<br>
5<br>
	The invention is based on the idea of using, in combination, means located outside the loop<br>
	reactor for increasing the solids content of the slurry withdrawn from the loop reactor to<br>
	provide a concentrated slurry, and a high-pressure flash unit for essentially evaporating all of<br>
	the remaining liquid-phase hydrocarbons of the slurry phase diluent to provide a gas/solids<br>
10	 mixture containing polymer solids gases. Alternatively, the slurry can be concentrated when it<br>
	is withdrawn from the reactor.<br>
	Thus, the apparatus for producing an olefin polymer in the presence of a catalytic system<br>
	preferably comprises, in a cascade, a loop reactor, means for increasing the concentration of<br>
15	 polymer slurry withdrawn from the loop reactor, a high-pressure flash and a gas phase reactor.<br>
	The means for increasing the concentration of the slurry can be located externally to the loop<br>
	reactor or be arranged in conjunction with the reactor outlet.<br>
	The process according to the invention for producing olefin polyners in the presence of a<br>
20	 catalytic system in a continuously operated multistage polymerisation sequence, comprises<br>
	the steps of<br>
	- continuously withdrawing from the loop reactor a polymer slurry containing polymer<br>
	and fluid mixture containing diluent, monomers and optionally hydrogen,<br>
	- optionally, concentrating the slurry by removing a part of the hydrocarbon diluent to<br>
25	 provide a concentrated slurry,<br>
	- conducting the concentrated slurry to a high pressure flash unit in order to remove<br>
	essentially all of the remaining hydrocarbon diluent and to provide a product stream<br>
	containing a mixture of polymer solids and gases,<br>
	- transferring the product stream from the flash into the gas phase reactor.<br>
30	<br>
	According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the product stream from the flash unit<br>
	can be purged countercurrently in a gas-exchange zone with essentially hydrogen-free gas in<br>
	order to reduce the amount of hydrogen carryover to the gas phase reactor.<br><br>
5<br>
	The present invention provides important advantages, Thus, it is possible to produce bimodal<br>
	polyethylene with good properties. There is no harmful carryover of reactants from the first<br>
	polymerisation stage to the second polymerisation stage. Expensive overdesign of process<br>
	elements can be avoided. The operation of the process is stable because of the truly<br>
5	 continuous operation. The time of transitions and start-up can be reduced.<br>
	Further details and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following<br>
	detailed description comprising a number of working examples.<br>

	The present invention includes the following steps, which will appear from the attached<br>
	drawing showing an embodiment of the invention:<br>
	Olefin monomers like ethylene and optionally one or more alpha-olefin comononer(s) are<br>
5	 polymerised in a loop reactor 1 in a hydrocarbon diluent, preferably propane or isobutane, in<br>
	the presence of a polymerisation catalyst, optionally in the presence of hydrogen. The<br>
	polymer slurry is continuously withdrawn from the loop reactor 1 through an outlet nozzle.<br>
	At least a part of the polymer slurry thus withdrawn is conducted to a hydrocyclone 2, in<br>
10	 which the slurry is concentratted to provide a first product stream having a high concentration<br>
	of solid matter and a second product steam, which mainly consists of hydrocarbon diluent<br>
	separated from the polymer slurry. The first product stream forms the underflow of the<br>
	hydrocyclone 2 and it is conducted via fiash pipe 22 to receiving vessel of the flash unit 3,<br>
	which preferably is operated at a high pressure. The overhead flow comprising the second<br>
15	 product stream of the hydrocyclone is recycled from the hydiocyclone 2 to the loop reactor 1.<br>
	The bottom flow containing the polymer is conducted from the receiving vessel of the flash<br>
	unit 3 into a gas phase reactor 4, preferably by gravity drop or pressure difference.<br>
20 	At least a part of the overhead flow from the receiving vessel of the flash unit, consisting<br>
	mainly of hydrocarbons is recycled directly or indirectly into the loop reactor 1 or gas phase<br>
	Optionally, the flow containing the polymer can be passed through a gas exchange lone<br>
25	 before it is introduced into the gas phase reactor 4.<br>
	The various steps of the process will now be described in more detail.<br><br>
7<br>
	A. Loop Reactor<br>
	In the loop reactor 1, olefins like ethylene are homopolymerised or eopolymerised with at<br>
	ieast one C6 to C10 alpha-olefin. The polymerisation takes place in an inert hydrocarbon<br>
5	 diluent or liquid monomer, preferably a C5 to C5 hydrocarbon diluent, more preferably in<br>
	propane or isobutane diluent, and in particular propane diluent.<br>
	The temperature in the loop is from about 60ºC to about 110ºC. preferably from 75 to 105<br>
	°C. If ethylene orpropylene is homopolymerised in the loop reactor, it is preferred to operate<br>
10	 the loop reactor at conditions known as "supercritical", where the operating temperature<br>
	exceeds the critical temperature of the reaction mixture and the operating pressure exceeds the<br>
	critical pressure of the reaction mixture. At such conditions, the operation temperature is<br>
	higher than 90 °C, preferably higher than 93ºC,<br>
15	 The operating pressure needs to be selected so that the contents of the loop reactorremain<br>
	cither in liquid state or supercritical state. For liquid slurry operation, the suitable range of<br>
	operating pressure is from about 20 to about 100 bar, preferably from 25 to 75 bar. For<br>
	supercritical slurry operation, the suitable range of operating pressure is from about 50 to<br>
	about 100 bar, preferably from 55 to 80 bar.<br>
20<br>
	Suitable catalysts that can be used to polymerise ethylene are, e.g., Ziegler-Natta catalysts,<br>
	single-site catalysis, multi-site catalysts containing one or more single-site catalyst<br>
	components, or combinations or mixtures of these.<br>
25 	The Ziegler-Natta catalyst comprise titanium and magnesium compounds, optionally also<br>
	aluminium compounds, and may be supported on an inert support, such as. silica or<br>
	magnesium dichloride. Preferable catalysts are those that are disclosed in EP688 794, EP 949<br>
	274, WO 99/58584 and WO 01/55230.<br>
30 	The single-site catalyst may be any catalyst that comprises one or more submitted of<br>
	unsubstituted cydopentadienyl ligands. Particularly useful are catalysts disclosed in WO<br>
	97/28170 and WO 00/34341.<br><br>
8<br>
	Preferably, ethylene is (co)polymerised in the loop reactor in the presence of hydrogen to<br>
	produce the low molecular weight polymer component Typically, the reaction mixture<br>
	contains from 0 to 10 %, preferably from 0 to 4 mol-% of alpha-olefin comonomer. If a<br>
	Ziegler-Natta catalyst is used, the reaction mixture typically contains from 2 to 10 mol-%<br>
5	 hydrogen, preferably from 2 to 8 mol-%. If a single site catalyst is used, the reaction mixture<br>
	typically contains from 0.01 to 1 mol-% hydrogen. Further, the reaction mixture contains<br>
	typically from 1 to 10 mol-%, preferably from 3 to 10 mol-% ethylene. If a single site catalyst<br>
	is used, then slightly lower ethylene concentration may be used. The reaction mixture further<br>
	comprises the components of the diluent. Preferably, the major part of the diluent is propane,<br>
10	 with minor quantities of other alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and buttanes.<br>
	The concentration of the polymer in the reactor slurry is typically from 10 to 40 % by volume,<br>
	preferably from 20 lo 30 % by volume.<br>
15 	The polymer slurry is withdrawn from the loop reactor continuously through an outlet.The<br>
	outlet may be placed at any suitable location in the reactor. However, most preferably the<br>
	outlet is located at a suitable location downstream of the loop circulation pump, t! is also<br>
	possible to withdraw the slurry from the loop reactor in such a manner that the concentraaon<br>
	of solids at the outlet is higher than the concentration of solids in the loop reactor. The slurry<br>
20	 may be directed into the flash unit directly or through a further concentration step.<br>
	Pressure of the reactor is controlled by continuous withdrawal of the slurry from the reactor<br>
	through an outlet nozzle. The said slurry can be directed to the hydrocydone. In that case the<br>
	pressure control valve is located in the product take off line of the hydrocyclone.<br>
25<br>
	Performance of the hydrocyclone is highly dependent on the feed conditions. Any disturbance<br>
	in the bottom flow will affect the performance of the hydrocyclone. The design can be made<br>
	e.g. by allowing a wide controlling range for the feed flow. Stable operating conditions could<br>
	then be reached by recycling a part of the slurry from the bottom of the hydrocyclone to the<br>
30	 reactor.<br>
	Cut size of the particles can be adjusted e.g. by controlling the feed flow to the hydroc yclone.<br><br>
9<br>
	Solids concentration at the bottom of the hydrocyclone can be measured and adjusted by<br>
	adjusting [he ratio of the recycle flow (overflow) and the product flow (underflow).<br>
	B. Hydrocyclone<br>
5<br>
	From the loop reactor 1 the polymer slurry is directed to a hydrocyclone 2. where the<br>
	concentration of the slurry takes place by effect of centrifugal forces. The hydrocyclone<br>
	divides the slurry flow into two streams: An overflow 21, which is rich in liquid, and an<br>
	underflow, which is rich in polymer. The overflow is returned to the loop reactor or to a fines<br>
10	 collection tank (not shown in the drawing) and the underflow is directed to a flash unit.<br>
	As described above, the slurry entering the hydrocyclone has a solids content of 10 to 40 %<br>
	by volume. The solids concentration in the underflow can be adjusted by adjusting the ratio of<br>
	the recycle flow (overflow) to the product flow (underflow), and is typically from 30 to 55 %<br>
15	 by volume, preferably 40 to 52 % by volume. It is often advantageous to recycle a part of the<br>
	underflow back to the loop reactor.<br>
	The maximum solids concentration in the product flow is set by the limit of stable operation.<br>
	If the solids concentration of the slurry is too high, the risk of plugging the product flow<br>
20	 increases. For economical reasons, on the other hand, as high as possible solids concentration<br>
	in the slurry is desired<br>
	Typically, the ratio of recycle flew to product flow is from about 0.01 to about 10, preferably<br>
	from 0.01 to 5 and more preferably from 0.1 to 2.<br>
25<br>
	The solids concentration of the recycle flow is typically about 0 (or at least 0.001) to 5 %by<br>
	C. High Pressure Flash Unit<br>
30<br>
	The flash unit 3 typically consists of a heated flash pipe 22 and a receiving vessel 3. The<br>
	slurry entering the flash unit has a solids concentration of 30 to 60% by volume. In the flash<br>
	unit, the remaining hydrocarbons are removed from the polymer. The flash pipe is preferably<br>
	heated, e.g. by steam or water. If water is used for heating, [he heating water can be<br><br><br>
10<br>
	advantageously taken from the jacket of the loop reactor. The temperature is selected<br>
	according to the composition at the hydrocarbon fluid so that the fluid is essentially<br>
	evaporated. "the phrase "essentially removing the fluid phase" means that a major fraction of<br>
	the fluid phase is removed and only an amount of fluid that fills the volume between the<br>
5	 polymer particles and the volume of pores in the polymer particles remains with the polymer.<br>
	Typically, the temperature at the receiving vessel is from 50 to 100ºC. preferably from 60 to<br>
	90ºC, in particular from 70 to 90 °C, and a pressure of 10 to 30 bar, preferably 12 to 21 bar,<br>
	and in particular from 14 to 34 bar. The pressure is preferably higher than the pressure in the<br>
	gas phase reactor, to allow smooth transfer of the polymer into the gas phase reactor.<br>
10	 Advantageously, the pressure is at least 0.05 bar higher than in the gas phase reactor.<br>
	At least a part of the overhead flow 31 from the receiving vessel of the flash unit 3 is passed<br>
	to the recovery system for recycling into the loop reactor 1 or gas phase reactor 4 or both. A<br>
	small purge stream can be recycled e.g. to a cracker.<br>
15<br>
	D. Gas Exchange Zone<br>
	The product flow 32 from the flash receiving vessel 3 is directed into a gas phase reactor. The<br>
	flow contains about the void volume of gas of the same composition as the loop reactor fluid<br>
20	 the rest being polymer. Before introduction into the gas phase reactor, the product flow can be<br>
	passed through a gas exchange zone 5, where it is flushed countercurrently with essentially<br>
	hydrogen free gas fraction from the diluent recovery or with a pure hydrocarbon, preferably<br>
	propane, to reduce the amount of hydrogen carryover to the gas phase reactor. The gas<br>
	displacement zone comprises a conduit and a control valve or optionally one or two rotary<br>
25	 feeders.<br>
	There are different ways of implementing the gas exchange zone. One possibility is simply to<br>
	have a control valve in the conduit used for transporting the polymer from the flash into the<br>
	gas phase reactor. The flush gas is then introduced into the conduit upsteam the control valve<br>
30	 and optionally also below the control valve.<br>

	comonomers, or the olefins like ethylene ate homopotymerised.<br>
	Preferably, the olefins like ethylene are copolymerised in the gas phase reactor with a minor<br>
	amounts of hydrogen to produce a high molecular weight polyethylene eopolymer. The<br>
20	 reaction mixture contains typically from 5 to 25 mol-% ethylene, from 0.1 to 10mol-% alpha-<br>
	olefin comonomer and from 0.01 to 3 mol-% hydrogen. If a single site catalyst is used to<br>

30	 concentrated slurry, returning the overflow 21 containing hydrocarbons from the<br>
	hydrocyclona to the loop reactor, directing the concentrated slurry through a heated flash pipe<br>
