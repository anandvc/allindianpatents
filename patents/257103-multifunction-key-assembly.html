MULTIFUNCTION KEY ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a multifunction key assembly for an<br>
electronic device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is considerable demand for the miniaturization of electronic<br>
devices in general and for cellular telephones in particular. On the other hand, there<br>
is increasing demand for electronic devices that include more and more features.<br>
Invariably, these demands result in a reduction in the display area, that is, the size of<br>
the display screen, or of the viewable area. A major reason for this being the<br>
necessity of maintaining a conventional keypad matrix arrangement for inputting<br>
data. Although the size and the spacing of the buttons that form a conventional<br>
keypad matrix arrangement are constantly being reduced as a result of<br>
miniaturization, there is a limit to their reduction. Moreover, with small buttons, or<br>
closely spaced buttons, there is a high likelihood of accidentally depressing an<br>
unintended button which is adjacent an intended button, or even simultaneously<br>
depressing two adjacent buttons thereby providing false input data. Moreover, since<br><br>
the buttons arc depressed one by one for each input data, speed of operation is<br>
limited.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,441,753 discloses a multifunction key assembly for<br>
electronic devices. The multifunction key assembly has a button member having an<br>
upper contoured surface defining nine key regions, which in a preferred<br>
embodiment, are arranged in a manner consistent with the one through nine keys of<br>
a conventional telephone keypad with the central key region representing the five<br>
key of a telephone keypad and each perimeter key region represents the remaining<br>
keys. However, unlike the conventional keypad matrix the zero, asterisk and pound<br>
sign keys are missing. An auxiliary button may be representative of the zero key.<br>
Alternatively, each key region may serve multiple functions. For example, the five<br>
key region may operate as a conventional zero key upon a double-click. This option<br>
is suggested, but its implementation is not described. Whatever the case, the<br>
numeral zero cannot be entered through the principal mode of operation and<br>
therefore every time a zero that has to be entered will disrupt the smooth flow of<br>
data input.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved<br>
multifunction key assembly for inputting data to an electronic device and an improved<br>
method for inputting data to an electronic device.<br>
This object is attained with the with the subject matter in accordance with<br>
the respective claims.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is preferably provided a<br>
multifunction key assembly comprising:<br>
two switches electrically connected to each other, each switch being capable of<br>
giving rise to exactly four distinct output signals when in an electrically on-state;<br>
a single key cap coupled to the two switches, the single key cap being capable of<br>
selectively activating the two switches either separately or simultaneously, whereby a<br><br>
total of twelve possible distinct output signals can be outputted from the multifunction<br>
key assembly, eight distinct output signals being obtained when each of the two<br>
switches is activated separately and four distinct output signals when the two switches<br>
are activated simultaneously.<br>
The multifunction key assembly may be located external to, located in, or<br>
partially located in, an electronic device and the output signals may be used as input<br>
data to the electronic device. Generally, the output signals will be electric signals,<br>
which may be transformed into other types of signals.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the key cap is moveable from<br>
a non-active position to an active position by vertically depressing at least a portion of<br>
the key cap, wherein in the non-active position both switches are in an electrically off-<br>
state and wherein in an active position at least one of the switches is in an electrically<br>
on-state, there being a total of three active positions, a first active position<br>
corresponding to one of the switches being in an electrically on-state, a second active<br>
position corresponding to the other one of the switches being in an electrically on-state<br>
and a third active position corresponding to the two switches being simultaneously in<br>
an electrically on-state.<br>
It will be appreciated that depressing at least a portion of the key cap<br>
defines a direction, which is referred to herein as the vertical direction.<br>
Further in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the key cap is<br>
horizontally displaceable in two mutually perpendicular directions to four contact<br>
positions. Typically, the two mutually perpendicular directions are termed North-<br>
South and East-West and the four contact positions are, in clockwise direction, North,<br>
East, South and West. The two mutually perpendicular directions are coplanar and<br>
perpendicular to the vertical direction in which the at least a portion of the key cap is<br>
depressed.<br>
Yet further in accordance with a preferred embodiment, for each<br>
combination of a given contact position and a particular active position of the key cap,<br><br>
a specific distinct output signal of the twelve possible distinct output signals is<br>
outputted by the multifunction key assembly.<br>
In accordance with a first preferred embodiment, each switch comprises a<br>
single electrically conducting stem, the keycap being coupled to the stem of each<br>
switch.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment, each switch further<br>
comprises an electrically non-conducting guide member, the guide member having<br>
two throughgoing guide grooves perpendicular to each other forming a cross-shaped<br>
aperture.<br>
Typically, each end of the two guide grooves is provided with an electrical<br>
contact. Since there are two guide grooves perpendicular to each other forming the<br>
cross-shaped aperture, there will be four ends and therefore four electrical contacts. A<br>
given contact position is obtained when a part of the at least one of the switches is in<br>
electrical abutment with a given electrical contact.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment, the stem of each switch<br>
passes through the grooves of an associated guide member and the part of the at least<br>
one of the switches which is in electrical abutment with one of four electrical contacts<br>
is the stem of the at least one of the switches.<br>
In accordance with a second preferred embodiment, the key cap is coupled<br>
to a single centrally located electrically conducting stem.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the single stem passes through<br>
a single cross-shaped aperture in a single electrically non-conducting guide member,<br>
the aperture comprising two throughgoing guide grooves perpendicular to each, with<br>
electrical contacts being located at each end of each guide groove, there being in all<br>
four electrical contacts, wherein a given contact position is obtained when the stem is<br>
in electrical abutment with a given electrical contact.<br>
Preferably, there arc exactly two switches that are connected to each other.<br>
There is also provided in accordance with the present invention a method<br>
for providing one of twelve distinct output signals, preferably comprising the steps of:<br><br>
(a)	providing a multifunction key assembly comprising two switches electrically<br>
connected to each other and coupled to a single key cap;<br>
(b)	vertically displacing the key cap from a non-active position to an active position<br>
by depressing at least a portion of the key cap, wherein in the non-active position both<br>
switches are in an electrically off-state and wherein in an active position at least one of<br>
the switches is in an electrically on-state; and<br>
(c)	horizontally displacing the key cap in one of two mutually perpendicular<br>
directions to one of four contact positions, thereby providing the one of the twelve<br>
distinct output signals.<br>
The order of carrying out the steps of the method does not have to be in<br>
accordance with the order given above. For example, if desired, step (c) can be<br>
carried out before step (b).<br>
There is further provided in accordance with the present invention a<br>
cellular telephone comprising:<br>
a casing having a plurality of surfaces;<br>
a display screen ; and<br>
a multifunction key assembly comprising:<br>
two switches electrically connected to each other, each switch being capable of<br>
outpuliing exactly four distinct output signals when in an electrically on-state;<br>
a single key cap coupled to the two switches, the single key cap being capable of<br>
selectively activating the two switches either separately or simultaneously, whereby a<br>
total of at least twelve possible distinct output signals can be outputted from the<br>
multifunction key assembly, eight distinct output signals being obtained when each of<br>
the two switches is activated separately and four distinct output signals when the two<br>
switches are activated simultaneously.<br>
If desired, the display screen is located on a front surface of the casing<br>
and the key cap is located on a side surface of the casing.<br>
The present invention provides the following preferred advantages over<br>
conventional technologies:<br><br>
It facilitates the miniaturization of electronic devices in general and cellular<br>
telephones in particular.<br>
It enables the use of larger display screens.<br>
The multifunction key is operated by a single key cap.<br>
The single key cap may be operated by the thumb of one hand of an operator.<br>
The single key cap is simple to operate. Twelve distinct output signals can be<br>
obtained by displacing the key cap horizontally in two mutually perpendicular<br>
directions (North - South, East - West) in combination with depressing the key cap at<br>
three different regions thereof.<br>
Other advantages of the present invention are readily apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art from the following figures, description, and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attention is drawn to Fig. 1 showing a typical electronic device 20 in<br>
accordance with the present invention. A non-binding example of such an electronic<br>
device 20 as illustrated in Fig. 1 is a cellular telephone. The electronic device 20<br>
comprises a casing 22, a display screen 24 on a front surface 25 of the casing 22, a<br>
multifunction key assembly 26 in accordance with the present invention having a key<br>
cap 28, a loudspeaker 30, an earphone 32, a microphone 34 and auxiliary keys 36.<br>
Noticeably missing is the conventional keypad for inputting data to the electronic<br>
device 20. Moreover, the multifunction key assembly 26 of the present invention is<br>
much smaller than the conventional keypad and therefore may be positioned within<br>
the electronic device 20 in such a manner that the key cap 28 is located on a side<br>
surface 37 of the casing 22 of the electronic device 20, thereby freeing the great<br>
majority of space of the front surface 25 for the display screen 24, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The multifunction key assembly 26 can be incorporated in the electronic<br>
device 20 as an integral part thereof, or it may be manufactured as a separate module<br>
and conveniently inserted and removed therefrom as required. The multifunction key<br>
assembly 26 in the form of a module is shown in Fig. 2. For convenience of<br>
illustration only, the multifunction key assembly 26 in the form of a module will be<br>
described. This has no limiting effect on the description of the multifunction key<br>
assembly 26, but merely serves to restrict the description to the features of the<br>
multifunction key assembly 26, thereby excluding from the description features of the<br>
electronic device 20 which are not relevant to the invention.<br>
With reference to Figs. 3 to 6, the multifunction key assembly 26<br>
comprises, in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, in addition<br>
to the key cap 28, a housing 38, two switches 40 and two electrically non-conducting<br>
guide members 42. Each switch 40 comprises an electrically conducting stem 44<br>
having a longitudinal axis A defining a longitudinal direction of the switch 40, a<br>
movable guide cylinder 46 in which one end of the stem 44 is retained and a fixed<br>
guide cylinder 48 in which the movable guide cylinder 46 is longitudinally<br><br>
displaceable. Protruding from a lower end 50 of the fixed guide cylinder 48 are two<br>
electrically conducting leads 52. It will be appreciated that if the multifunction key<br>
assembly 26 is not a separate module but is incorporated in the electronic device 20 as<br>
an integral part thereof, then the housing 38 of the multifunction key assembly 26 will<br>
be a part of the casing 22 of the electronic device 20.<br>
Each switch 40 and an associated guide member 42 is located in a chamber<br>
54 in the housing 38 having a lower step 56 which abuts the lower, end 50 of the fixed<br>
guide cylinder 48, thereby supporting the switch 40 against longitudinal forces applied<br>
to the stem 44 by the key cap 28. The key cap 28 has opposing upper and lower<br>
surfaces 58, 60 and has a generally elongated oval or elliptical shape having a long<br>
dimension D defining a longitudinal axis L of the key cap 28. Two push buttons 62<br>
project from the upper surface 58 of the key cap 28 at ends of the key cap 28, that is,<br>
at extremities of the long dimension D of the key cap 28. In addition, two opposing<br>
elongated projections 64 project from the upper surface 58, extending adjacent long<br>
edges 66 of the key cap 28 on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis L. The end of<br>
each stem 44 distal the movable guide cylinder 46 is retained in a bore 68 passing<br>
through a cylindrical protrusion 70 protruding from the lower surface 60 of the key<br>
cap 28 directly below an opposing push button 62, thereby mechanically connecting<br>
the key cap 28 to the switches 40.<br>
Each guide member 42 has two throughgoing guide grooves 72, 74<br>
perpendicular to each other forming a cross-shaped aperture. The guide member 42 is<br>
supported in the chamber 54 by an upper step 75 and has a small protrusion 42' which<br>
is located in a recess 76 in the housing 38, in order to fix the orientation of the guide<br>
grooves 72, 74. The stem 44 of each switch 40 passes through the guide grooves 72,<br>
74 of an associated guide member 42 so that the guide member 42 is located between<br>
the movable guide cylinder 46 and the key cap 28. The end of each stem 44 distal the<br>
movable guide cylinder 46 protrudes beyond a top surface 77 of the housing 38 and<br>
the lower surface 60 of the key cap 28 is adjacent and opposite the top surface.<br>
Generally, the top surface 77 is an outer surface of the housing 38 of the multifunction<br><br>
key assembly module. However, if the multifunction key assembly 26 is incorporated<br>
in the electronic device 20 as an integral part thereof, then the top surface will be part<br>
of the external surface of the casing 22 of the electronic device 20.<br>
One of the guide grooves 72 of each guide member 42 is aligned with the<br>
longitudinal axis of the key cap 28 and will be referred to herein as the longitudinal<br>
guide groove. The other one of the guide grooves 74 of each guide member 42 is<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the key cap 28 and will be referred to herein<br>
as the transverse guide groove. At the ends of the longitudinal and transverse grooves<br>
72, 74 are electrical contacts 78, 80, 82, 84. Consequently, all in all there are four<br>
electrical contacts 78, 80, 82, 84 associated with the guide grooves of each guide<br>
member 42. These will be labeled first, second, third and fourth electrical contacts 78,<br>
80, 82, 84, as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
As will described in greater detail below, the key cap 28 can be moved in<br>
various directions by applying an external force to it. In general, an external force is<br>
applied to the key cap 28 by an operator placing a thumb on the upper surface 58 of<br>
the key cap 28, or on one of the push buttons 62 and then either depressing the key<br>
cap 28 and displacing it "vertically" by applying a force in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the switches 40, or displacing the key cap 28 "horizontally" by applying a force in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the switches 40. In addition,<br>
both vertical and horizontal forces can be applied simultaneously. The stems 44 are<br>
preferably resilient to allow sufficient horizontal displacement of the key cap 28.<br>
If no vertical force is applied to the key cap 28, then the key cap 28 is said<br>
to be in a non-active state. If no external force at all is applied to the key cap 28, then<br>
the key cap 28 is said to be in its rest position.<br>
Since the stems 44 are constrained to move in the guide grooves 72, 74, the<br>
horizontal displacement of the key cap 28 is constrained to move longitudinally and<br>
transversely, corresponding to movement of the stems 44 in the longitudinal and<br>
transverse guide grooves 72, 74, respectively. In other words, the key cap 28 can be<br>
displaced horizontally in two mutually perpendicular directions.<br><br>
Two support pins 86 are provided. Although not absolutely necessary, the<br>
support pins 86 aid in restoring the key cap 28 to its rest position (Figs. 8 and 9A)<br>
after having been displaced and the external force is removed. The support pins 86<br>
have conical protrusions 88 at one end and flat surfaces 90 at the other end. The<br>
support pins 86 are located in cavities 92 in the housing 38 and are biased by means of<br>
helical springs 94 located in the cavities 92 below the support pins 86 and in contact<br>
with the flat surfaces 90. The conical protrusions 88 are received in conical indents 96<br>
in the lower surface 60 of the key cap 28.<br>
When the key cap 28 is displaced vertically by depressing it, it is displaced<br>
from its rest position, or from a non-active position, (Fig. 9A), to an active position.<br>
There are precisely three active positions. A first active position (Fig. 9B) is obtained<br>
by displacing a first end of the key cap 28 vertically, that is, by depressing a first of the<br>
push buttons 62' so that only the stem 44 coupled to the first push button 62' is<br>
displaced vertically thereby changing the electrical state of the of the first switch 40'<br>
from an off-state (electrically non-conducting) to an on-state (electrically conducting).<br>
A second active position (Fig. 9C) is obtained by displacing a second push button 62"<br>
end of the key cap 28 vertically, that is, by depressing the second push button 62" so<br>
that only the stem 44 coupled to the second push button 62" is displaced vertically<br>
thereby changing the electrical state of the of the second switch 40" from an off-state<br>
to an on-state. A third active position (Fig. 9D) is obtained by displacing the whole of<br>
the key cap 28 vertically, that is, by depressing the upper surface 58 of the key cap 28<br>
at a location between the two push buttons 62 so that both stems 44 are displaced<br>
vertically thereby changing the electrical state of both switches 62 from an off-state to<br>
an on-state.<br>
After the key cap 28 has been moved to a given active position by<br>
depressing it vertically, an output signal can be obtained by moving the key cap 28 to a<br>
particular contact position. This is achieved by retaining the key cap 28 in the given<br>
active position and displacing it horizontally either longitudinally or transversely until<br>
the stem 44, that is, a part of the switch 40, comes into electrical contact with one of<br><br>
the four electrical contacts 78, 80, 82, 84 of the guide grooves 72, 74. A distinct<br>
output signal is obtained for each combination of a given active position and a<br>
particular contact position. The elongated projections 64 serve to prevent the<br>
operator's thumb from slipping when displacing the key cap 28 horizontally and when<br>
the operator's thumb is at a location between the two push buttons 62.<br>
Since there are three active positions (Fig. 9B, Fig. 9C and Fig. 9D) and<br>
four contact positions (corresponding to the first, second, third and fourth electrical<br>
contacts, 78, 80, 82, 84), a total of twelve distinct output signals can be obtained. As a<br>
non-binding example, one could choose these twelve distinct output signals to<br>
represent the 10 numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 and the functions "clear" and "back<br>
space". Which particular combinations of active positions and contact positions are<br>
used to represent these twelve outputs is a matter of choice. As a non-binding<br>
example, the four output signals for the numerals 1, 2, 3 and 4, defining a first set of<br>
outputs, may be obtained using the first active position (Fig. 9B) along with the first,<br>
second, third and fourth contact positions, respectively; the four output signals for the<br>
numerals 5, 6, 7 and 8, defining a second set of outputs, may be obtained using the<br>
second active position (Fig. 9C) along with the first, second, third and fourth contact<br>
positions, respectively; and the four output signals for the two numerals 9, 0, and the<br>
two functions "clear" and "back space", defining a third set of outputs, may be<br>
obtained using the third active position (Fig. 9C) along with the first, second, third and<br>
fourth contact positions, respectively.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 10 showing an illustrative view of one<br>
possible arrangement for the electrical wiring of the two switches 40 and their<br>
respective guide members 42 that will enable the multifunction key assembly 26 to<br>
provide the output signals mentioned above. The stems 44 are electrically common<br>
and grounded along with one of the electrically conducting leads 52 of each switch<br>
40. Also, the first, second, third and fourth electrical contacts 78, 80, 82, 84 of one of<br>
the two guide members 42 are electrically common with the first, second, third and<br>
fourth electrical contacts 78, 80, 82, 84, respectively, of the other one of the two guide<br><br>
members 42. For illustrative purposes, the first, second, third and fourth contact<br>
positions, are denoted by (I), (II), (III) and (IV), respectively, and the first and second<br>
active positions are denoted by (IXb) and (IXc), respectively. With this notation, in<br>
accordance with the example given above, the output signal for the numeral 1, from<br>
the first set of outputs, is given symbolically by the combination (IXb) + (I), that is,<br>
the first push button 62' is depressed, so that the first switch 40' is in an on-state, as<br>
shown in Fig. 9B and the key cap 28 is in the first contact position. Similarly, the<br>
output signal for the numeral 5, from the second set of outputs, is given symbolically<br>
by the combination (IXc) + (I), that is, the second push button 62" is depressed, so<br>
that second switch 40" is in an on-state, as shown in Fig. 9C and the key cap 28 is in<br>
the first contact position. In order to obtain an output signal from the third set of<br>
output signals, both switches 40 have to be in an on-state, that is, both push buttons 62<br>
have to be depressed, as shown in Fig. 9D. For example the output signal for the<br>
numeral 9 is given symbolically by the combination (IXb) + (IXc) + (I).<br>
In order to output other signals, such as letters of the alphabet, the key cap<br>
28 may be "double-clicked" before it is displaced in the manner described above.<br>
Alternatively, one or more of the auxiliary keys 36 may be actuated. Therefore, a<br>
large amount of information such as numerals, letters, symbols, functions, etc. can be<br>
outputted from the multifunction key assembly 26.<br>
In accordance with the first embodiment described above, each of the two<br>
switches 40 has a stem 44 and an associated guide member 42. As is clear from the<br>
above description of the first embodiment, the stems 44 and guide members 42 are<br>
required in order to obtain the four contact positions.<br>
With reference to Fig. 11, in accordance with a second embodiment of a<br>
multi-function key assembly 126, only one stem 144 and associated guide member<br>
142 is required, the single stem 144 and the single guide member 142 being joint to<br>
both switches 140 (140', 140"). The stem 144 is electrically grounded along with one<br>
of the leads 152 of each switch 140. As with the first embodiment, the guide member<br>
142 is electrically non-conducting and has a cross-shaped aperture comprising two<br><br>
throughgoing guide grooves 172, 174 perpendicular to each, with electrical contacts<br>
178, 180, 182, 184) being located at each end of each guide groove (172, 174).<br>
Consequently, there are all in all four electrical contacts (178, 180, 182, 184). The<br>
stem (144) passes through the cross-shaped aperture, and a given contact position is<br>
obtained when the stem (144) is in electrical abutment with a given electrical contact<br>
(178,180,182,184).<br>
With reference to Figs. 12 to 14, the key cap 128 is coupled to one end of<br>
the single stem 144, which is centrally located with respect to the key cap 128. As in<br>
the case of the first embodiment, the key cap 128 has a pair of pushbuttons 162',<br>
162". The other end of the stem 144 is affixed to a flexible holding member 198,<br>
which may be made, for example, of rubber. The holding member 198 is located in a<br>
base member 100, which in turn is located in the housing 138. The guide member 142<br>
has two transverse grooves 102, in its upper side 104 in which two transverse rails<br>
106, protruding from the lower side 108 of a sliding member 110, are slidingly<br>
received. The sliding member 110 has a longitudinal groove 112 in its upper side 114<br>
in which a longitudinal rail 116 protruding from the lower surface 160 of the key cap<br>
128 is slidingly received. Each switch 140 (140', 140") comprise an upper<br>
component 140U and a lower component 140L, so that each switch is in an off-state<br>
(electrically non-conducting) when a gap exists between the upper and lower<br>
components 140U, 140L and in an on-state (electrically conducting) when upper and<br>
lower components 140U, 140L contact each other.<br>
The twelve distinct output signals are obtained from the multifunction key<br>
assembly 126 of the second embodiment, by applying the same set of operations to the<br>
key cap 128 as described for the first embodiment. For example, by depressing the<br>
first push button 162' (see Fig. 9B with respect to pushbutton 62'), so that the upper<br>
and lower components 140U, 140L of the first switch 140' are brought into contact<br>
thereby causing the first switch 140' to be in an on-state, and sliding the key cap to the<br>
first contact position (so that the stem 144 is in contact with the first electrical contact<br>
178), the output signal for the numeral 1 is obtained. As with the first embodiment,<br><br>
this is given symbolically by the combination (IXb) + (I). Similarly, the other eleven<br>
distinct output signals are obtained as described above for the first embodiment.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of<br>
particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications<br>
could be made without departing from the scope of the invention as hereinafter<br>
