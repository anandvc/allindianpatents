				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of Invention<br>
The present invention concerns a container for launching a light torpedo type weapon from a surface vessel, the container being directly installed in the firing position and-operating in autonomous fashion.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
To launch weapons of the light torpedo type from a surface vessel, it is common to use horizontal launch tubes or catapults installed on the deck of the vessel or in specific locations generally equipped with means for handling and loading the weapons into the tubes or onto the catapults.<br>
When stored in containers, light torpedoes require that the crew perform laborious operations of handling, conditioning, and placing the weapon in the launching means. During all of these phases, the weapon is no longer protected and is exposed to the risk of damage. In addition, installations for handling weapons and loading tubes are generally complex and require additional personnel, and generate additional costs resulting from research, implementation, and maintenance thereof. The energy necessary for launching weapons of the light torpedo type is generally furnished by compressed air. For a tube launch, the cylinders are placed in the breech door or on the tube; opening a valve creates an overpressure behind the weapon, which is then propelled toward the front of the tube and ejected from the ship. For a catapult launch, compressed-air cylinders furnish the energy to an actuator which propels the weapon to eject it from the ship. Installations using tubes or catapults also comprise a compressed-air panel intended for initial charging of the launch cylinders or for recharging them after use.<br>
-1A-<br><br>
European Patent No. 662599 describes a method where it is 'not necessary to extract the torpedo in order to launch it. It contains a torpedo having batteries which supply power to propulsion means, and an interlock device which isolates an arming assembly for the charge and is released at the moment the weapon departs. On most light torpedoes, these elements are kept in place by what is called a "single pin" device. In addition, the torpedo has a remote control connector connected to the control computer for programming the weapon. These elements must be removed no later than the moment of launching. It is thus the movement of the torpedo which causes removal of these devices.<br>
A container of this kind has a number of disadvantages. The container is not autonomous, since it is necessary to remove the front and rear ends of the torpedo in order to allow the energy source and torpedo outlet to be connected, and to position them on a launching bank which supplies the energy required for launch. In addition, there is almost routinely a degradation of the elements for removing the remote control connector, thus increasing the workload necessary to allow re-use of the container.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the invention is to provide a container for storing and launching a torpedo type weapon which allows the weapon to be launched in autonomous fashion from its storage position with no handling operation and with no degradation of the remote control connector when the torpedo is launched.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a storage and compressed-air launching container with which weapons can be stored in the depot and can be transported to the vessels which are to be equipped therewith.<br>
-2-<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a container for storing and launching a light torpedo type weapon, comprising : stacking means ; an arming interlock device connected to the weapon ; a remote control device connected to the weapon and having a remote control connector ; compressed air storing and releasing means for storing and releasing compressed air necessary for simultaneously launching the weapon and separating the arming interlock device and the remote control device ; extracting means for allowing the compressed air to arrive at a device for extracting the remote control connector; a front plug, the ejection of the front plug being caused by an overpressure inside the container, and the ejection taking place during firing and before the weapon has traveled a distance such that it is separated from the front plug ; deactivating means for deactivating a torpedo holding system ; and locking means for maintaining the locked position of a pin.<br>
According to another characteristic the extracting means comprises an electrodistributor. The extracting means may comprise a body and a piston coupled to the lever, the lever being coupled to the body ; and a cable is hooked at one end onto the lever and on the other end is attached to the remote control connector after passing over a spindle.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As has been mentioned, one aspect of the invention is to eliminate handling of the torpedo to bring it into the firing position. The container according to the invention allows this aspect to be achieved since it is directly installed in the firing position. Another aspect of the invention is to allow the weapon to be stored in a depot and transported to vessels without handling of the weapon itself. The container according to the invention allows this aspect to be achieved because it replaces conventional storage and transport containers for light torpedoes.<br>
Figure 1 shows container body 1, stacking means 2 represented here by frames, a front cover or plug 3, a coaming 4 onto which is mounted a device for extracting remote control connector 5, a device for extracting pin 6, a sealed leadthrough 7 providing connection to the torpedo remote control connector, a dehydration device 8 for maintaining a defined humidity level, and a torpedo holding device 9 coaming with a sphere 15 on the torpedo.<br>
-3A-<br><br>
4<br>
A rear casing 10 incorporates all of the components necessary for storing and releasing the launch energy, namely: a tank 11, a launch valve 12 integrated into the tank, a slow-acting purge valve 13 for filling and purging the tank, and a slow-acting valve 14 providing continuity for the launching air circuit to a firing electrodistributor 16.<br>
At the depot, casing 10 is detached from the body of the container. The torpedo is guided into body 1 on slides. Torpedo holding device 9 is put in place so as to immobilize the torpedo by means of its sphere 15.<br>
The operation thereof will be examined later in the text. Remote control connector 5 and pin 6 are installed. Casing 10 is reinstalled on the rear of body 1. After being connected to an ad-hoc installation, slow-acting purge valve 13 is opened to allow tank 11 to be filled. A pressure sensor (not depicted in Figure 1) indicates the pressure inside tank 11. After valve 13 has been closed and cap i 7 (shown in Figure 5) has been installed, container 1 is ready either for storage in a depot or for transport to a vessel.<br>
The containers are located at the periphery of the vessel so as to be directly in the firing position. The containers may, in particular, be stacked. Stacking means 2 may, for example, be frames comprising two parts assembled mechanically. The lower and upper surfaces are machined to serve as planes for mounting either on a foundation or on two other containers when stacking is implemented. Each frame is equipped with a centering device for positioning containers on their mounting foundation or, if stacking is implemented, for positioning the upper containers with respect to the lower containers. The mounting devices are integrated into the frames. According to the invention, installation of the container on the vessel involves the following operations:<br>
a) Mount the container by way of stacking means 2;<br>
b) Connect the cable transmitting torpedo data from the vessel's control<br>
computer to sealed leadthrough 7, and the cable transmitting electrical interlocks and<br>
the firing command;<br>
c) Remove cap 18, open slow-acting valve 14 to allow air under pressure<br>
to arrive at firing electrodistributor 16, replace cap 18 (see Figure 5). A sensor 19<br>
indicates the position of slow-acting valve 14.<br>
The container is ready for firing.<br><br>
5<br>
The launch firing command, delivered by vessel's control computer, causes the following sequence:<br>
a) Firing electrodistributor 16 opens, allowing air under pressure to arrive<br>
at the device for extracting remote control connector 5. The electrodistributor<br>
possesses a manual control 20, accessible after removing the cap 21, which allows a<br>
manual "emergency" launch (see Figure 5).<br>
b) The device for extracting remote control connector 5 shown in Figure 2<br>
has a body 30, a piston 31 connected at 32 to a lever 33 which in turn is connected at<br>
34 to the body 30. A cable is hooked at one of its ends onto a lever 33, the other end<br>
being attached to remote control connector 5 after passing over a spindle 36.<br>
The arrival of air from firing electrodistributor 16 causes piston 31 and thus lever 33 to move. The tensile force exerted on cable 35 causes remote control connector 5 to be extracted. When it is at the end of its travel, piston 31 uncovers an orifice which allows air under pressure to arrive at torpedo holding device 9.<br>
c)	Torpedo holding device 9 shown in Figure 4 has two jaws 41 and 42<br>
connected about shaft 43, held in position by bolt 44. The latter is connected to a<br>
piston 45. The assembly is mounted in body 46. In the position shown, the torpedo is<br>
immobilized longitudinally by way of its sphere 15.<br>
The arrival of air from the device for extracting remote control connector 5 causes displacement of piston 45, which causes bolt 44 to travel linearly and thereby causes jaws 41 and 42 to unlock.<br>
At the end of its travel, piston 45 uncovers an orifice which allows air under pressure to arrive at launch valve 12 and cause it to open.<br>
This abrupt opening releases the compressed gas, which causes the torpedo to move forward, the movement being made possible by the unlocking of jaws 41 and 42.<br>
As will be seen, the forward movement of the torpedo causes pin 6 to release.<br>
d)	The device for extracting pin 6 shown in Figure 3 has a support 51<br>
attached to coaming 4, a lever 52 mounted on a shaft 55 of a rotating electromagnet<br>
53, a sensor 54, and a manual control 57 (not permanently installed).<br>
In a nominal launch, lever 52 maintains the head of pin 6 in position by the action of the return spring of electromagnet 53. Sensor 54 informs the launch computer that pin 6 is in the locked position, thus authorizing launch.<br><br>
6<br>
During the forward movement of the torpedo, pin 6 is subjected to a linear motion under the action of lever 52, and then releases the various torpedo interlocks.<br>
One launching mode, called an inert launch, requires that pin 6 not be extracted during the launch. For this, the device for extracting pin 6 has an electromagnet 53 which, when supplied with power, causes a rotation of lever 52 and thus causes the head of pin 6 to be released. Sensor 54 is then disengaged, the disengagement allowing the sequence to continue by supplying power to firing electrodistributor 16.<br>
If there is no electrical power to body 30 of electromagnet 53, or if the latter fails, a manual control 57, put in place after removing cap 58 attached to coaming 4, allows lever 52 to be actuated, thereby releasing the head of pin 6. The sequence can then continue.<br>
Another embodiment of the container according to the invention concerns front cover or plug 3. Front cover or plug 3 is attached to the body of the container by means of a gasket (not depicted) such that as soon as the launch air is released, an overpressure is created inside the container, causing front cover 3 to be ejected before the torpedo has traveled the distance which initially separated them. In other words, when the torpedo is launched, ejection of front cover 3 is caused by an overpressure inside the document, the ejection occurring before the torpedo has traveled the distance which separates it from front cover 3. The launch is thus entirely safe for the torpedo.<br>
To summarize, the use of a container according to the invention, makes it possible to achieve a certain number of advantages, such as:<br>
a) The torpedo is protected throughout the time it is stored in a depot,<br>
transported, handled, and installed at the firing point.<br>
b) The frames of the container allow it to be stacked naturally, either<br>
when stored in a depot or when installed on board.<br>
c) The container according to the invention can be used without any<br>
handling after it is installed at the firing point, since it is autonomous and comprises<br>
all the devices necessary for storing launch energy, charging it, and releasing it, with<br>
no need to establish a connection to an air panel installed on a vessel.<br>
According to the invention, the pneumatic device for extracting the remote control connector allows optimum extraction, preventing any deterioration of the<br><br>
7<br>
connector contact elements. In addition, the end of the movement of piston 31 creates continuity in the air circuit to the next component. The launch sequence is therefore completely separated: an elementary action does not begin until the previous one is complete.<br><br>
