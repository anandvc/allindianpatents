2.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
3.   The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to<br>
be performed		<br><br><br>
AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF BENZODIAZEPINE DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
An improved process mainly concern with the method of preparation and isolation of pharmaceutically active benzodiazepine derivatives such as clobazam, tetrazepam and clotiazepam etc.Furthermore, theses derivatives containing ring chlorine atom or atoms and to functional derivatives thereof. These Pharmaceutically active agent are short acting drugs in the benzodiazepine class used to treat anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Benzodiazepine derivatives such as clobazam, tetrazepam and clotiazepam are marketed for<br>
therapeutic indications like anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant.<br>
The general scheme for preparation of the benzodiazepine derivatives is as follows:<br><br><br>
(The spiral Line indicate the side that is attached to the benzodiazepine nucleus)<br>
And<br>
X is carbon or nitrogen.<br>
Y is carbon or nitrogen or carbonyl group.<br>
Z is,<br><br>
From above mentioned general scheme, it appears that there is a common strategy for synthetic preparation of the benzodiazepine derivatives involves N-methylation benzodiazepine ring as a common step. The benzodiazepine moiety (Formula-II) required for synthesis can be prepared from corresponding suitable benzophenone derivatives which is commonly described in the literature. The synthesis of benzodiazepine involves a common step N-methylation and formation   of  pharmaceutically   active   benzodiazepine   derivatives   from   benzodiazepine<br><br>
derivatives (formula-II).The formation of benzodiazepine derivatives and its N-methylation forms a common synthetic step in various pharmaceutically active benzodiazepine derivatives such as clobazam, tetrazepam and clotiazepam etc.<br>
The preparation of Tetrazepam is disclosed in US-3426014, in which 7-chloro-5-(l -cyclohexenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro- 1H benzo(f) diazepine-1,4 is methylated with sodium methoxide as base and methyl iodide as methylating agent in dry dimethyl formamide. The Tetrazepam is isolated from from reaction mixture by extracting with ethyl acetate.<br>
As per US-3551412, N-methylation of 7-chloro-5-(l -cyclohexenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro- 1H benzo(f) diazepine-1,4 is carried out in anhydrous dimethyl formamide as a solvent media using sodium methoxide as base and methyl iodide as a methylating reagent to produce clobazam with yield 52%.<br>
The drawback of this process is the usage of expensive methylating agent like methyl iodide and moderate yield of 52%.Further, maintenance of anhydrous condition may be the limiting factor on large scale preparation.<br>
As per US3984398 methylation of 1-phenyl -8-chlorol,2A5,tetrahydro-2,4-dioxo-3H-l-5-bezodiazepine is carried out by acting methyl chloride in presence of sodium ethanolate fallowed by recrystallization in 50% ethanol or isopropanol to gives l-phenyl-5- methyl -8-chlorol,2,4,5,tetrahydro-2,4-dioxo-3H-l-5-bezodiazepine.    In    similar    way    alkylation    i.e.<br><br>
butylation is carried out in anhydrous ethanol and sodium by using n-butyl bromide as alkylation reagent.<br>
From commercial point of view, above said preparation can generate industrial waste on large scale due to aqueous dimethyl formamide. Hence there is need for cost effective and commercially viable process for preparation of benzodiazepine derivatives such as clobazam, tetrazepam and clonazepam.<br>
In our embodiment N-methylation carried out in biphasic solvent system such as methylene chloride and alkaline water (5.2 % sodium hydroxide solution) in presence of phase transfer catalyst like tetra butyl ammonium bromide which gives good yield about 80-85% compare to yield reported in prior art.<br>
In another embodiment the reagent used for N-methylation purpose is dimethyl sulphate which is cheap and readily available methylating agent. The present invention provides a process which is devoid of the use of expensive and hazardous reagent, and critical reaction parameters. Also, the solvent used as reaction medium is recovered after completion of reaction which makes the process environment friendly and commercially viable.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of said invention is to provide a commercially suitable process which involves<br>
convenient operation parameters, use of non hazardous regents and solvents for the preparation<br><br>
of benzodiazepine derivatives such as clobazam, tetrazepam and clotiazepam.Other object of said invention is to provide cost effectiveness due to high yield over the existing prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
This invention mainly directed to industrially feasible and environment friendly process for the preparation of benzodiazepine derivatives such as clobazepam, tetrazepam and clonazepam etc. In this N-methylation is carried out under milder conditions and also it avoids the use of highly toxic reagents.<br>
This method offer distinct advantages over prior art used for the preparation of benzodiazepine derivatives which involves simple reaction parameters  with ease of isolation and solvent used can be recovered,. Hence by reduce the generating waste.    Importantly the present method is industrially applicable and cost effective due to good yield i.e. 80-85% . The preparation of benzodiazepine derivatives involves the following common synthetic step:<br><br><br>
(The spiral line indicate the side that is attached to the benzodiazepine nucleus)<br>
And<br>
X is carbon or nitrogen atom.<br>
Y is carbon or nitrogen or carbonyl group.<br>
