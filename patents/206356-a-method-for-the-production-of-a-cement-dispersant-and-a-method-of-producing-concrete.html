				<td>1A Field of invention :<br>
This invention relates to a method for the production of a cement dispersant and a method of producing concrete.    At work sites where cement compositions are used,   it is important to be able to provide high fluidity to cement compositions, to reduce the drop in the proyided fluidity with time ("the slump loss") and to obtain a sufficient early strength during the initial period of   hardening such that the frames can be removed quickly and the work efficiency can be thereby improved. This invention relates to cement dispersants which can respond to such requirements, as well as methods of using such cement dispersants to produce concrete with improved quality. This invention also relates to concrete produced by using such a cement dispersant.<br>
Examples of prior art cement dispersant for providing fluidity to cement compositions include salts of high condensates of naphthalene sulfonic acid formaldehyde and melamine sulfonic acid formaldehyde, as well as water-soluble vinyl copolymers. Cement compositions prepared by using salts of high condensates of naphthalene sulfonic acid formaldehyde or melamine sulfonic acid formaldehyde, however, have the problem of a high slump loss. Those prepared by using water-soluble vinyl copolymers of the conventionally   proposed kind    (such as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publications Tokko    58-38380,     59-18338   and   5-11057 and U.S.  Patents 4 962 173,   5 087 648,   5 290 869   and   5 362 829 ) have smaller slump losses but there are problems wherein their setting times become longer and hence a sufficient early strength cannot be obtained during the early period of hardening. This problem is particularly significant with high-strength cement compositions with a limited water-to-cement ratio.<br><br>
2<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The problem to be overcome by the present invention is that prior art cement dispersants could produce only cement compositions with a large slump loss or incapable of providing a sufficiently large early strength, this problem being particularly significant with high-strength cement compositions with a limited water-to-cement ratio.<br>
The present invention was accomplished as a result of investigations by the present inventors and is based on their discovery that water-soluble vinyl copolymers constituting of specified kinds of constituent units (herein referred to simply as "units") at a specified ratio and having both the weight average molecular weight and the ratios between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight within a specified range are suitable as a cement dispersant.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention :<br>

Of these, methoxy polyethoxyethyl methacrylates with the repetition number of oxyethylene units in the range of 7-23 are preferred.<br>
Water-soluble vinyl copolymers to be used as a cement dispersant according to this invention may be obtained by radical copofymerization of vinyl monomers forming Units A-D, or preferably Units A, B, C, E and F at a specified copolymerization ratio in the presence of a radical initiator. The radical copolymerization can be carried out by aqueous solution polymerization using water or a mixed solvent with water and a water-soluble organic solvent either continuously or by batches. For example, each of the vinyl monomers is initially dissolved in water to prepare an aqueous solution with pH 4.5-6.5 containing these vinyl monomers by 10-40 weight % as their<br><br>
5<br>
total. Next, a radical initiator is added to this aqueous solution within a nitrogen gas atmosphere to carry out a radical copolymerization reaction at 50-70°C for 5-8 hours and to thereby obtain water-soluble vinyl copolymer. Any radical initiator which generates radicals by decomposing at the reaction temperature of copolymerization may be used for the copolymerization reaction of either of the vinyl monomers, but the use of a water-soluble radical initiator is preferred. Examples of such water-soluble radical initiator include persulfates such as potassium persulfate and ammonium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, and 2,2-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride. They may be combined with a reducing agent such as a sulfite and L-ascorbic acid or amines to be used as a redox initiator.<br>
As described above, water-soluble vinyl copolymers to be used as a cement dispersant according to this invention are characterized as comprising Units A-D, or preferably Units A, B, C, E and F at a specified ratio, but they are also required to have the weight average molecular weight (pullulan converted by GPC method) and the ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight (hereinafter denoted as Mw/Mn) within specified ranges. Adjustment of such molecular weight distributions can be effected by a conventional method of appropriately controlling concentrations of the vinyl monomers in the system for radical copolymerization, the pH of the polymerizing system, its temperature and the addition of a chain transfer agent. In order to obtain a water-soluble vinyl copolymer with a desired molecular weight distribution, it is preferred to set the pH value of the polymerizing system at 4.0-6.5 and to add a chain transfer agent such as 2-mercapto ethanol, 2-mercapto propionic acid, 3-mercapto propionic acid, thioglycol acid and thioglycerine to the polymerizing system. Since vinyl monomers forming Unit B function as a themselves, this property may be appropriately taken advantage of.<br>
The water-soluble vinyl copolymers constituting of Units A-D, to be used as a cement dispersant according to this invention, contain Unit A by 40-80 molar % or preferably by 55-72 molar %, Unit B by 0.5-20 molar % or preferably 3-18 molar %, Unit C by 0.2-18 molar % or preferably 3-15 molar %, and Unit D by 2-40 molar % or preferably 3-30 molar % (such that the total is 100 molar %). Those constituting of Units A, B, C, E and F contain Unit A by 40-80 molar % or preferably 55-72 molar %, Unit B by 0.5-20 molar % or preferably 3-18 molar %, Unit C by 0.2-18 molar % or preferably 3-15 molar %, Unit E by 2-15 molar % or preferably 3-12 molar %, and Unit F by 0.5-15 molar % or preferably 1-12 molar % (such that the total is 100 molar %).<br>
The water-soluble vinyl copolymers to be used as a cement dispersant according to this invention are further characterized in that their weight average molecular weight be 15000-150000 or preferably 25000-70000 and that their ratio Mw/Mn be 2-7 or preferably 3-6.5.<br><br>
5A<br><br><br>
This invention also relates to a method of producing concrete, said method comprising the step of mixing cement aggregates, a cement dispersant and water such that concrete with water-to-cement ratio of 20-45% is produced, said cement dispersant consisting of water-soluble vinyl copolymers comprising 40 to 80 molar % of Unit A having Formula (1), 0.5 to 20 molar % of Unit B having FormuJa (2), 0.2 to 18 molar % of the Unit C having Formula (3) and 2 to 40 molar % of the Unit D having Formula (4), total content of said Units A, B, C and D being 100 molar %, said water-soluble vinyl copolymers having weight-average molecular weight pullulan converted by GPC method 15000 to 150000 and ratio of weight average molecular weight to number-average molecular weight being 2 to 7, said Formulas (1) to (4) being given by :<br>

For preparing cement compositions by using a cement dispersant of this invention, different kinds of agents may be used together, depending of the purpose. Examples of such agents include air entraining agents, antifoaming agents, waterproofing agents, hardening accelerators and antiseptics. They may be added with kneading water when the cement composition is prepared or after the cement composition has been mixed and kneaded.<br>
Cement dispersants of this invention can be used for cement compositions such as mortars and concrete prepared by using a binder composed of cement or a mixture of cement and a microscopic powder admixture. Examples of cement which can be used include many kinds of Portland cement such as ordinary portland cement, high early strength portland cement and moderate heat portland cement, blast furnace cement, fly ash cement, silica fume cement as well as many other kinds of blended cement. Examples of microscopic powder admixture include silica fume, blast-furnace slag and fly ash.  Cement dispersants of this invention are normally mixed at a ratio of 0.05-2.0 weight parts, or preferably 0.1-1.5 weight parts, as converted to solid component per 100 weight parts of the binder comprised of cement or a mixture of cement and a microscopic powder admixture.<br>
As explained above, water-soluble vinyl copolymers to be used as a cement dispersant according to this invention are characterized not only as constituting of Units A-D, or preferably Units A, B, C, E and F, at a specified ratio, but also as having weight average molecular weight and Mw/Mn within specified ranges.   Those constituting of Units A, B, C, E and F are particularly characterized as containing in the molecule both a relatively long polyoxyethylene graft chain and a relatively short polyoxyethylene graft chain.  Cement dispersants of this invention with such particular characteristic are effective not only when used with ordinary cement compositions with the water/cement ratio in excess of 45% but also with cement compositions with the water/cement ratio 20-45% such as concrete. They can provide high fluidity even to high-strength concrete with the water/cement ratio limited to 20-45%, reduce the slump loss, limit the setting time delay and realize a sufficient early strength.<br>

parts (0.27 moles) and water 1500 parts were placed inside a reactor vessel, and after a 30% water solution of sodium hydroxide 90 parts was added to adjust the pH and to obtain a uniform solution, the atmosphere was replaced with nitrogen gas. The pH was of the reacting system was 5.8.   The temperature of the reacting system was maintained at 60 °C by means of a temperature bath and a polymerization process was started by adding a 20% water solution of sodium persulfate 30 parts by titration over 3 hours. The polymerization process was continued for 2 hours more to conclude the polymerization. Thereafter, a 30% water solution of sodium hydroxide 10 parts was added for complete neutralization to obtain a reaction product. After a portion of the product thus obtained was condensed inside an evaporator, it was precipitated and refined inside a mixed acetone/isopropanol solvent and dried to obtain water-soluble vinyl copolymer (Test Example 1). This water-soluble vinyl copolymer (Test Example 1) was analyzed by NMR, elemental analysis, titration method and GPC and was found to be a water-soluble vinyl copolymer having sodium methacrylate as Unit A by 63 molar %, sodium methallyl sulfonate as Unit B by 15 molar %, methyl acrylate as Unit C by 8 molar % and methoxypoly(p=45)ethylene glycol monomethacrylate as Unit D by 14 molar % (the total being 100 weight %), of which the weight average molecular weight was 42500 and Mw/Mn = 4.6.<br>

The polymerization process was continued for 3 hours more to conclude the polymerization. Thereafter, a 30% water solution of sodium hydroxide 63 parts was added for complete neutralization to obtain a reaction product. After a portion of the product thus obtained was condensed inside an evaporator, it was refined and dried by using a mixed solvent to obtain water-soluble vinyl copolymer (Test Example 2). This water-soluble vinyl copolymer (Test Example 2) was analyzed by NMR, elemental analysis, titration method and GPC and was found to be a water-soluble vinyl copolymer having sodium methacrylate as Unit A by 67 molar %, sodium methallyl sulfonate as Unit B by 15 molar %, methyl acrylate as Unit C by 11 molar % and methoxypoly(p=68)ethylene glycol monomethacrylate as Unit D by 7 molar % (the total being 100 weight %), of which the weight average molecular weight was 46000 and Mw/Mn = 4.8.<br><br>

Part 2 (Preparation and Evaluation of Concrete) Preparation of Concrete<br>
Each of the test examples of concrete was prepared by placing ordinary portland cement (specific weight=3.16, Braine vaIue=33OO), fine aggregates (sand from Ooi River with specific weight=2.63) and coarse aggregates (crushed stone from Okazaki with specific weight=2.66) sequentially into a 50-liter pan-type forced kneading mixer under the conditions shown in Table 3 and kneaded for 15 seconds. Next, the cement dispersants prepared in Part 1 were added together with kneading water at a rate of 0.1 -1.5 weight % with respect to the cement converted to solid components such that the target slump value would be within the range of 21±lcm and the mixture was kneaded for 2 minutes. An agent for controlling the amount of air was kneaded in with water in each case such that the target air content would become 4.0-5.0%.<br><br>

Evaluation of Concrete<br>
For each of test and comparison examples, slump value (SV), air quantity (AQ), setting time and compression strength were measured according respectively to J1S-A1101, JIS-Al 128, JIS-A6204 and JIS-A1108 immediately after the kneading (t=0), 60 minutes later (t=60) and 90 minutes later (t=90). The results are shown in Tables 4-7. In these Tables, the numbers in parentheses following the test and comparison example numbers indicate the condition of preparation defined in Table 3. Slump ratio is defined as the percentage ratio of the slump value after 90 minutes to the slump value immediately after the kneading.<br>
These tables clearly show that cement dispersants according to this invention can provide a high level of fluidity while limiting the slump loss, as well as a high early strength at the initial period of hardening.<br><br>
