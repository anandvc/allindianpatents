				<td>The invention relates to a rack made up of frame members for a switchgear cabinet, in which the frame members have  two attachment projections respectively provided with an  attachment section located parallel to the associated<br>
 outer sides of the rack, and with a profile side located<br>
vertically to the associated outer side of the rack, and<br>
the attachment sections and the profile sides have row. of attachment means spaced apart at identical intervals.<br>
A rack of this type is known from DE 43 36 285 Al.  Such frame members are constructed symmetrically to their cross-sectional diagonal.  At a connecting section facing outwards in the corner area of the rack, the attachment projections are located on both sides of the cross-sectional diagonal.  The attachment projections and the profile sides with their attachment means are attached to the attachment projections.  The attachment section and the profile side of an attachment projection are at right angles to one another.  Assembly rails or the like may be attached to the attachment means.  Then built-in components, such for example as electronic units, can then be mounted thereon.<br>
Such assembly rails are described for example in DE 1 95 03 289.  The assembly rails, U-shaped in cross-section,<br>
are screwed with angled portions tc the attachment means of the attachment projections of two adjacent vertical frame members.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a rack of the type already mentioned, in which the attachment points for the built-in components are standardised.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved in that the spacings of the profile sides of one attachment projections from the attachment sections of the other attachment projection are respectively equal to the spacing interval of the attachment frame, or that the spacing corresponds to a multiple of the spacing interval.<br>
Because the spacing of the attachment means of the profile sides to the attachment means of the attachment sections is at a fixed ratio to the spacing interval of the attachment means, a rack can be provided in which the attachment points for the built-in components form a spatial grid.  The built-in components may be mounted in this grid at any point on the rack.  In this way a high degree of variability for the possible attachments cf built-in components is provided.  In this case the spacing can be equal to the spacing interval of the attachment means, or it can be a multiple of this<br>
spacing.  In this case a multiple can also comprise a fraction of the spacing.  What is important is that a surrounding attachment grid results.  "Intermediate attachment means" can also be used in this attachment grid in the rows of attachment means within the interval jump.<br>
According to an advantageous development of the invention, the attachment sections cf two vertical frame members adjacent to one another of the rack can form a first assembly plane and the profile sides parallel therewith can form a second assembly plane, and continuous assembly rails can be attached to the attachment means of the attachment sections and of the profile sides.<br>
The two attachment planes in this case are spaced apart at the grid interval or at a multiple thereof.  With the two parallel assembly planes, there arise possibilities of attachment for built-in components of differing widths.<br>
In this case it is advantageous if the assembly rails have a support section, located in the first or in the second assembly plane, and provided with at least one row of attachment means, the attachment means being at an identical spacing interval corresponding to the spacing<br>
interval on the profile sides cr on the attachment sections, or corresponding to a multiple thereof.  Thus the interval grid, formed with the attachment means of the frame members, is continued into the assembly rails.<br>
A simple design of an assembly rail is characterised in that it is formed, U-shaped in cross-section, from the support section and two webs connected thereto and spaced apart parallel from one another.<br>
If the webs of the assembly rail are provided with attachment means, then further possibilities are provided for attaching built-in components.  In these rows of attachment means also, a fixed interval grid is observed.<br>
In order to attach the assembly rails to the frame members, a development according to the invention is characterised in that tabs projecting at the ends are integrally formed on the support section of the assembly rail, said tabs being securable by attachment members to the attachment sections or the profile sides, and in that the tabs are offset relative to the support section so that the support section lies in the plane formed by the profile sides/attachment sections.  This ensures that the assembly rails lie on the assembly planes formed by the profile sides/attachment sections.<br>
According to a further development cf the invention it is possible to attach wall members to the attachment sections and/or profile sides.  As wall members there may for example be attached claddings, which cover an entire side or only a partial area of the side of the rack.  The<br>
 wall .members may also be designed as assembly panels.<br>
in particular it is thus possible to locate outer walls parallel'to the wall members, and to form between the •wall'members and the outer walls shafts for example for cables, insulating or sound-deadening material, or as air ducts.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a rack made up of frame members for a switchgear cabinet, in which the frame members have two attachment projections respectively provided with an attachment section located parallel to the associated outer sides of the rack, and a prpfile side located vertically to the associated outer side of the rack, and the attachment sections and the profile sides having rows of attachment means spaced apart at identical intervals, characterized in that the spacings of the profile sides (16) of one attachment projection (10.1) from the attachment sections (17) of the other attachment projection (10.2) is respectively equal to the spacing interval of the attachment means (16', 17'), or in that the spacing corresponds to a multiple of the spacing interval.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the following with reference to an embodiment.given by way of example and shown in the drawing, which shows:<br>
Figure I: a perspective view of a portion.of a rack with two assembly rails, and<br>
Figure 2: a partial perspective view of a vertical frame member of the rack with wall members mounted thereon.<br>
Figure 1 shows two vertical frame members 10 of a rack. For reasons of clarity, in Figure 1 only the right-hand frame member 10 is provided in detail with reference<br>
numbers.  However, all the vertical frame members 10 of the rack are identical in design, so that they can be inserted in all corner areas.<br>
The frame member 10 has a connection section 11, to which attachment sections 10.1, 10.2 are connected on both sides.  The two attachment sections 10.1, 10.2 are again identical in structure, so that symmetry to the cross-sectional diagonal of the frame member 10 results. Connected to the connection section 11 is a web section 23 standing at an angle.  This latter merges into a right-angled portion 14.  The angled portion 14 forms together with the folded portion 15 a rearwardly-offset receiving space.  In this receiving space, for example, a folded portion of a door or wall member can be accommodated.  It is also however possible to accommodate the folded portion in the area of the return formed in between the web sections 13 and the connecting section 11.  Connecting at right angles to the folded portion 15 is a seal connecting web 12.  A wall member, as shown by the number 20 in Figure 2, may connect with and be sealed with this seal-connecting web.<br>
As is further seen from Figure 1, the attachment section 10.1, 10.2, in connection with the seal, connection web 12 carries two profile parts at right angles to one another, which are specifically marked as profile side 16<br>
and attachment section 17.  The profile side 16 and the attachment section 17 respectively carry a row of attachment means 16', 17', which in this case are in the form of rows of apertures.  The attachment means have a unified spacing interval to one another.<br>
Between the two attachment projections 10.1, 10.2 and facing the interior of the rack is an undercut dovetail groove with webs 19 and end sections 18.  The end sections 18 are laid on the connecting web 11 and fixed at that point, for example by welding.<br>
Assembly rails 40, 50 can be secured between the two vertical frame members 10.  The assembly rails 40, 50, U-¬shaped in cross-section, are formed from a support section 42, 52 and connected therewith are webs 41, 51 which are spaced apart and parallel.  In turn, rows of attachment means 45, 46, 55, 56 are inserted in the support section 42, 52 and the webs 41, 51 of the assembly rails 40, 50.  In this case holes and slots are provided in alternation.  The holes have an identical spacing interval with one another.  Likewise the slots are offset to one another by the dimension of a spacing interval.  The spacing interval of the holes and slots again corresponds to the spacing interval produced with the attachment means 16', 17' in the profile sides 16 or attachment sections 17.  In order to attach the assembly<br>
rails 40, 50 the support sections 42, 52 are elongated at the end by means of tabs 43, 53.  Screw receiving means are produced in these tabs 43, 53, into which attachment members 44, 54 may be introduced and connected to the attachment means 16', 17' of the profile sides 16 or attachment sections 17.  The tabs 43, 53 are provided on their side facing the vertical frame member 10 with hooks and/or pegs.  By means of these the assembly rails 40, 50 can be pre-positioned on the attachment means 16', 17'.<br>
The spacing of the profile sides 16 of one attachment projection 10.1, 10.2 from the attachment section 17 of the other attachment projection 10.1, 10.2 corresponds in the present case to the spacing interval of the attachment means 16', 17', 45, 46, 55, 56.  Thus the support sections 42, 52 of the assembly rails 40, 50 form two assembly planes offset parallel to one another.  the offsetting in this case corresponds to the dimension of the spacing interval.<br>
As Figure 1 shows, the support sections 42, 52 are aligned flush to the profile sides 16 or to the attachment section 17.  For this purpose there are integrally formed on the tabs 43, 53 transitional sections which hold the support section 42, 52.  The rows of holes in the webs 41, 51 of the assembly rails 40, 50<br>
merge into the associated rows of holes of the attachment sections 17 or of the profile sides 16.<br>
Figure 2 shows the attachment of wall members to the frame member 10, as explained in more detail in Figure 1. The wall members 20 can be applied to the outwardly turned seal-contact webs 12.  Said wall members 20 carry seals 22, by means of which they are applied in a sealed manner to the seal-contact web 12.  The folded'portions 21 of the wall members 20 project into the receiving space formed in front of the connecting section 11.  The receiving space is offset backwards relative to the outer sides of the rack frame.  A wall member 30' can be attached to the left-hand attachment projection 10.2. For this purpose the wall member 30' is provided with screw receiving means 31'.  Attachment screws can be inserted into these screw receiving means 31', and can be screwed to the attachment means 17' of the attachment section 17.  In the present case, the wall member 30 can be used as an assembly panel, to which built-in components are secured.  Formed between the wall member 20 and the assembly panel is a shaft, in which installation and insulating material can be inserted, or it can be used as an air duct.<br>
The attachment projection 10.1 is an alternative attachment of a further wall member 30' ' .  The wall<br>
member 30' has a folded portion 32' facing the cuter side of the frame.  Bores 31' are inserted in this folded portion 32'.  By means of these holes 31' the wall member 30' can be screwed to the profile side 16 of the attachment projection 10.1.  Once the wall member 30' is fixed, the wall member 20 covering the outer side of the frame can be attached.  Here also a shaft is provided between the wall members 20 and 30'.<br>
The present examples respectively show that two attachment projections 10.1, 10.2, spatially separated from one another, are secured on one connecting web 11. According to the core idea of the invention it is however also possible for the two attachment projections 10.1, 10.2 to be combined.<br>
The important factor is that the spacing intervals according to the invention between the profiles 16 and the attachment projections 17 are maintained.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
