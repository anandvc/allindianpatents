DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS      FOR      PRODUCING      ETHANOL      BY      USING RECOMBINANT CORYNEFORM BACTERIUM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing ethanol. Particularly, the present invention relates to a process of producing ethanol wherein sugars such as glucose are used as raw material, and more particularly, a process for highly efficiently producing ethanol at a high productivity consisting of using a coryneform bacterium which has been transformed by a DNA containing gene expressing pyruvate decarboxylase (referred to hereinafter as PDC) activity and, if desired, a gene expressing alcohol dehydrogenase(referred to hereinafter as ADH) activity under a regulatory sequence allowing the expression, and fermenting a raw material, sugars such as glucose, under ethanol production conditions wherein this bacterium does not substantially proliferate to produce ethanol, which is then collected.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Up to now, ethanol has been prepared by chemical synthesis  via   ethylene  from   fossil   resources   such   as   coal<br><br>
and petroleum, or a fermentation of sugars from biomass resource such as plant by a microorganism such as yeast or bacteria. Among these, a process for producing ethanol by fermentation using a renewable biomass resource in light of energy resource or environmental problems has been noticed.<br>
A process for producing ethanol by a conventional large-scale industrial fermentation is a process by fermenting starch or sugars from various biomass resources, namely, a technology based on a brewage for potable ethanol. However, the use of a yeast as a fermentation microorganism results in slow rate of ethanol production and also difficulties such as complicated fermentation control because of the necessity of aeration, even though the fermentation is performed under anaerobic condition.<br>
It is well known to use a strain belonging to Zymomonas as a fermentation microorganism (Japanese Patent Publication No.  H7-59187).<br>
It is recognized that a fermentation process by using Zymomonas leads to increased rate of ethanol production compare to that by using a yeast. Improvement of ethanol production efficiency by biotechnological modification of various microorganism species has been proposed (Japanese Patent Publication Nos. H5-502366, H6-504436, and H6-505875).<br><br>
In the above tebhnologies, 2 genes from Zymomonas mobilis, one encoding for PDC activity (which catalyses the conversion of pyruvic acid in the glycolytic pathway to acetoaldehyde) and another ADH activity (which catalyses the conversion of acetoaldehyde to ethanol) were inserted into host (enteric bacteria such as Escherichia col i or Erwinia chrysanthe) under a regulatory sequence allowing for their expression. Consequently, ethanol fermentation with high productivity was achieved by using such transformants.<br>
According to the abovementioned technologies, improvement in ethanol productivity owes to the high growth and high cell density of the transformants in the fermentor. Such fermentation involving cell growth presents many inefficiencies including low conversion efficiency of sugar material to ethanol because the sugar material is used as an energy supply source for growth of said microorganism, low ethanol production rate during the period until the microorganism reaches stationary growth phase and complications in fermentor control due to the change of density of the microorganism accompanying the cell growth thereof.<br>
Another technological problem is separation of toxic substances when Escherichia coli used as a host cell. Escherichia   coli   is   succeptible   to   bacteriolysis   leading   to<br><br>
possible  contamination  of fermentation'products with  toxic intracellular protein.<br>
From this point of view, improvement of host microorganism to be transformed is desirable.<br>
PROBLEM TO  BE SOLVED  BY THE  INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a new process for producing ethanol by using biomass resources as raw material for sugars, wherein better excellent technology for efficiently producing ethanol at a high productivity has been accomplished and wherein various problems pointed out in the foregoing prior art have been solved.<br>
■ MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
The  present  inventors  have  made  extended  studies  to<br>
solve  the  problems  mentioned   above,   and  have  found  that<br>
efficient production of ethanol at a high productivity can be<br>
achieved  by  using  a  coryneform   bacterium which  has  been<br>
transformed   with   a   gene   expressing   PDC   activity,   and   if<br>
desired,  a gene expressing ADH activity under a regulatory<br>
sequence   allowing   for   expression,    and   then,    performing<br>
fermentation   under   ethanol   production   conditions   wherein<br>
the       transformed       coryneform       bacterium       does       not<br>
substantially proliferate,  whereby the present invention has<br>
been accomplished.<br><br>
One of the characteristics of the present invention is that a host bacterium to be transformed is a coryneform bacterium and that ethanol is prepared under conditions wherein the transformed coryneform bacterium does not substantially proliferate.<br>
EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>

pdhA gene /pdhB gene (acc.NO. U81 808)(Microbiology, vol.142,  2543-2548(1996)).<br>
It is necessary for the two genes to be under a regulatory sequence in order to express their activity, although they are not necessarily required to be under a common regulatory sequence. They may be under separate regulatory sequences and in some cases on a different plasmids and at a different sites on a chromosome.<br>
"Under a regulatory sequence" as used herein means that an intended gene can autonomously replicate by, for example, collaboratively acting with a promoter, inducer, operator, ribosome binding site and transcription terminator etc.<br>
A host microorganism transformed according to the<br>
present     invention     is     a     coryneform     bacterium.	The<br>
coryneform bacterium is a Gram-positive bacterium and<br>
different from a Gram-negative bacterium such as E. coli<br>
which is used as a host bacterium in the aforementioned<br>
prior     art.	It     is     noteworthy     that     USP5,482,846     and<br>
USP5,916,787 disclosed a process for transforming a Gram-<br>
positive bacterium by a gene expressing ADH activity and<br>
PDC activity. However, the Gram-positive bacteria as used<br>
therein	are	Bacillus,	Lactobacillus,	Fibribacter,<br>
Ruminococcus,     Pediococcus,     Cytophaga,     Cellulomonas,<br><br>
Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus polymyxa, but it is not taken into account that a coryneform bacterium can be used as the host cell to be transformed.<br>
One of the major characteristics of the present invention is that a coryneform bacterium, which does not originally have a function of ethanol production from pyruvic acid, is selected as the host to be transformed. Use of coryneform bacterium transformed according to the present invention, enabled us to prepare ethanol under conditions in which no substantial cell growth was observed, in contrast to the usual process for producing ethanol by fermentation with yeast, Zymomonas or enteric bacteria such as E. coli transformed according to the aforementioned prior art.<br>
Thus, by producing ethanol without cell growth, many technological problems resulting from cell growth as described above, are overcome. This has a significant value as a practical industrial production technology. The present inventors have discovered that such a technology can be achieved by using a coryneform bacterium.<br>
Substantial suppression of growth of coryneform<br>
bacterium can be achieved by subjecting the aerobic<br>
bacterium to anaerobic conditions, or restricting the<br>
essential nutritional requirement, biotin (J. Industrial.<br>
Microbiol.	vol.5,289-2 94.(1990)).	In	addition,<br><br>
biotechhological regulation of a function of a gene regulating growth would be an effective means.<br>
Although ethanol fermentation under anaerobic condition has already been accomplished, the technology emphasizes or is accompanied by cell growth. On the contrary, the present invention is quite different to the extent that the present invention is intended to suppress the substantial growth of a coryneform bacterium in an ethanol reaction vessel.<br>
The aforementioned prior art discloses that both anaerobic and aerobic conditions lead to an equivalent growth of a transformant and productivity of ethanol, which differs from the present invention in technological idea or content.<br>
An essential element of the present invention is to introduce into a coryneform bacterium a DNA containing a gene expressing PDC activity and, if required, a gene expressing ADH activity under a regulatory sequence allowing for expression.<br>
In this process, it is essential to introduce a gene expressing PDC activity, but not essential to introduce a gene expressing ADH activity. This is because usually a coryneform bacterium is deemed to have neither genes expressing the foregoing respective enzymes but it is uncertain   regarding   ADH.     Thus,   it   cannot   be   denied  that<br><br>
certain coryneform bacteria have the gene expressing ADH enzyme activity. In this case, it is basically enough to use only a gene expressing PDC enzyme activity as the gene to be introduced.<br>
However, both genes are preferably introduced to effect higher transformation even if the coryneform bacterium used as a host originally has an ability to produce ADH.<br>
There is no limitation as the type of aerobic<br>
coryneform bacteria transformed with the gene expressing<br>
PDC activity and, if desired, the gene expressing ADH<br>
activity, as long as it is a coryneform bacterium which is<br>
able to growth under usual aerobic conditions. Examples<br>
thereof are Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Arthrobacter,<br>
Mycobacterium, and Micrococcus. And more particularly,<br>
examples of Corynebacterium are Corynebacterium<br>
glutamicum	ATCC13032,	ATCC13058,	ATCC13059,<br>
ATCC13060, ATCC13232, ATCC13286, ATCC13287,<br>
ATCC13655, ATCC13745, ATCC13746, ATCC13761,<br>
ATCC14020, and ATCC31831. Examples of Brevibacterium<br>
are	Brevibacterium	lactofermentum	ATCC13869,<br>
Brevibacterium flavum MJ-233(FERM BP-1497) and MJ-<br>
233AB-41 (FERM BP-1498), Brevibacterium ammoniagenes<br>
ATCC6872. Examples of Arthrobacter are Arthrobacter<br>
globiformis	ATCC8010,	ATCC4336,	ATCC21056,<br><br>
ATCC31250, ATCC31738 and ATCC35698. As a transformation, there are processes for recombining a chromosome of a host bacterium with both genes, or a process to use a recombinant plasmid wherein both genes have been incorporated into a plasmid which can autonomously replicate in a host bacterium.<br>
A plasmid vector used for such purposes may be one<br>
containing a gene with an autonomous replication function<br>
in     a     coryneform     bacterium.	As     specific     example,<br>
pAM330(Agric. Biol.Chem. vol. 48,2901-2903 (1984) and<br>
Nucleic Acids Symp Ser. Vol. 16,265-267 (1985)) (from<br>
Brevibacterium lactofermentum 225), pHM1 51 9(Agric.<br>
Biol.Chem.vol.48, 2901-2903(1984) (from Corynebacterium<br>
glutamicum	ATCC13058),	pCRY30(Appl.	Environ.<br>
Microbiol, vol. 57, 759-764(1991)), pEKO, pEC5, pEKExl (Gene vol.102, 93-98 (1991)), and pCG4 (J. Bacteriol. Vol.159, 306-31 1(1984))(from Corynebacterium gluatmicum T250).<br>
Construction of a plasmid used for transformation of coryneform bacteria in the present invention can be effected, for example, in the case of a gene from Zymomonas mobilis being used, by linking a regulatory sequence such as an appropriate promoter and terminator with Dral-Dral 1.4 kb gene fragment containing an intact ADH gene (J.  Bacteriol.vol. 1 69,2591-2597( 1 987)),  and Dral-<br><br>
Dral 1.8 kb containing an intact PDC gene (J. -Bacterid, vol.169,949-954(1987)) respectively, which is then inserted at an appropriate restriction site of any one of a piasmid vector as exemplified above.<br>
An example of a promoter to express ADH gene and PDC gene in the aforementioned recombinant piasmid is, but not limited to, the one which is originally carried by a coryneform bacterium. It may be any base sequence which has a function to initiate the transcription of ADH gene and PDC gene. An example of a terminator which is put in the downstream of ADH gene and PDC gene under a regulatory sequence is, but not limited to, the one vfchich is originally carried by a coryneform bacterium. It may be, for example, any base sequence having a function to terminate the transcription of ADH gene and PDC gene, such as the terminator for tryptophan operon from E. coli.<br>
In the present invention, cultivation of the coryneform bacterium, which is performed prior to introduction of a piasmid vector containing such as the intended gene into the coryneform bacterium, can be performed under usual aerobic conditions. A medium used for cultivation of usual microorganism can be used as culture medium. For example, to a general medium containing natural nutrients such as meat extract, yeast extract, and peptone etc., solution    of    inorganic    salt    such    as    ammonium    sulfate,<br><br>
potassium   phosphate,   and   magnesium   sulfate   is   added,   if necessary.<br>
A process for introducing a plasmid vector containing<br>
the intended gene after the foregoing cultivation includes,<br>
but is not limited to, electroporation and the CaCI2 method<br>
as long as such process enables introduction of a gene into<br>
a coryneform bacterium. In an embodiment thereof, for<br>
example a known method can be used for an electrical<br>
pulsation	(Agric.Biol.Chem.vol.54,	443-447	(1990),<br>
Res. Microbiol, vol. 144,181-185(1 993)).<br>
As for the introduction of the intended gene into a chromosome, a similar method is available, for example, technology such as that described in DNA sequence vol.3,303-310 (1993) is available.<br>
A method for selecting the transformed coryneform bacteria employs antibiotic resistance, whereby a gene encoding for the said resistance is introduced into a plasmid vector or a chromosome containing the intended gene, and then plating the transformed coryneform bacterium, onto a plate containing an appropriate concentration of the said antibiotic. As an embodiment thereof, for example a method as described in Agric. Biol. Chem. vol.54,443-447 (1990), Res. Microbiol, vol. 144, 181-185 (1993) is available.<br>
Basically,    in    order    to    use    an    aerobic    coryneform<br><br>
bacterium for the process of preparing ethanol of the * present invention, a large amount of transformed coryneform bacteria must be cultured under usual aerobic conditions first. The present cultivation can be performed in a similar manner as a cultivation of a coryneform bacterium prior to transformation.<br>
Transformed coryneform bacteria of the present invention which were cultured under aerobic conditions are harvested by centrifugation, membrane filtration or chemically treated (for example, immobilization with carrageenan) in order to be used for a subsequent reaction to produce ethanol.<br>
For the reaction to produce ethanol, an aqueous solution containing the appropriate inorganic salt or buffer is preferably used. To the aqueous solution, sugars, such as glucose which is material for ethanol production, are added.<br>
The reaction to produce ethanol is performed under conditions wherein growth of the transformed aerobic coryneform bacterium is substantially suppressed. Various methods, as described above, can be employed to substantially suppress the growth, and it is adequate to put the transformed aerobic coryneform bacterium under anaerobic condition. A system for reaction to produce ethanol    may    be    batchwise    or    continuous    reaction,    and<br><br>
preferably continuous in view of achieving high productivity. Use of continuous reaction system in the process of the present invention does not lead to substantial growth of the coryneform bacterium and therefore the operation control thereof is easier than that of a conventional method, which is accompanied by cell growth,<br>
Sugars used as raw material for ethanol production include, preferably, but are not limited to, glucose which leads to rapid ethanol production.<br>
"Anaerobic conditions" as used herein means any conditions resulting in lowered concentration of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution, provided that a trace amount of the dissolved oxygen should be allowed as long as growth of the transformed coryneform bacterium is substantially inhibited. This condition is achieved by, for example, carrying out the reaction without aeration in a sealed container, or performing the reaction while supplying an inert gas such as nitrogen. The temperature for ethanol production is usually 15°C-45°C, and preferably 25°C-37°C. pH during the reaction is adjusted to the range of 5-9, and preferably 7-8. The coryneform bacterium used for ethanol production in the present invention can be used at a very high concentration such as 1 g/l-1500 g/l because it is not substantially growing during the reaction.<br>
In   ethanol   production   of   the   present   invention,    the<br><br>
cells are not substantially growing during the reaction, and raw material sugars are not consumed as a source of nutrition for growth. In addition, no need for induction period such as the exponential growth phase for providing a high-density culture of bacteria means that ethanol production with high density (high concentration) of cells from the early stage of reaction is possible, thereby highly efficient ethanol production at a high productivity can be achieved.<br>
Ethanol prepared according to the process as stated above is isolated from the reaction and purified, if necessary, and utilized as fuel ethanol or industrial raw chemical material.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention in detail, but should not be deemed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
