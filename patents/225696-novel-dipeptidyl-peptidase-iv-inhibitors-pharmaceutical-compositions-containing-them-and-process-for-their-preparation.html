THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION; AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS PERFORMED<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to dipeptidyl peptidase Iv (DPP-IV) inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositieos containing them. methods of preparing them, and methods for treating a condition that is regulated or normalized via inhibition of DPP-IV (such as Type II diabetes).<br>
Background of the Invention	<br>
Diabetes generally refers to a disease process derived from multiply causative factors, and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of macrovasuclar and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. Type I and II. In Type I diabetes (also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)) patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which reuiates glucose utilization. In Type II diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.(NIDDM')) patients often have plasma insulin levels that. are the. sarne or even elevated compared to nondiabetic lubjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the in,sulin stjmylaing ;ftect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues, and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is not primarily due to a diminished number of insulin receptors but to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of plucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and<br><br>
inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br>
The available treatments for Type II diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess rood consumption, especially ot toods containing high amounts of satmaied fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin bv administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide, which stimulate the Dancreatic B-cells to secrete nore insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulphonylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate insulin-resistance tissues. However dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. Biguanides can increase insulin sensitivitv resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has fewer side effects than phenformin and is often prescribed for the treatment of Type II diabetes.<br>
Glitazones (i.e., 5 benzywihriazolldlme-'2;4-diones) are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for ameliorating many symptoms of Type II diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type II diabetes resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensitization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type II diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from glitazones (i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects (e.g. liver toxicity) have occurred with some PPAR agonists, such as troglitazone.<br><br>
Other treatments are under investigation, including treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acrabose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-IB (PTP-1B) inhibitors.<br>
Compounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ("DP-IV" or "DPP-IV") enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that mayj&gt;e useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly Type 11 diabetes. See, for example, WO 97/40832, WO 98/19998, U.S. Patent No. 5,939,560, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 6(10): 1163-1166 (1996), and Bioorg. Med.Chem. Lett. 6(22):2745-2748 (1996). The usefulness of DPP-IV inhibitors in the treatment of Type II diabetes is based on the fact that DPP-IV in vivo readily inactivates glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are incretins and are produced when food is consumed. The incretins stimulate production of insulin. Inhibition of DPP-IV leads to decreased inactivation of the incretins, and this in turn results in increased effectiveness of the incretins in stimulating production of insulin by the pancreas. DPP-IV inhibition therefore results in an increased level of serum insulin. Advantageously, since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed, DPP-IV inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times, such as between meals, which can lead to excessively, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Inhibition of DPP-IV is therefore expected to increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretagogues. Improved DPP-IV inhibitors are needed for better treatment of diabetes.<br>

Methods of Preparing the Compounds of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be synthesized according to the general scheme shown below:<br>
General Scheme<br><br><br>
wherein L and L2 are leaving groups (such as bromide, chlorine, iodine, O-toluene sulphonyls and O-methyl sulphonyls) and PG is a protecting group (such as -BOC or -Cbz).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by methods known in the art. One such approach is shown in the general synthetic scheme above. An intermediate of formula (1) can be coupled with a mono-protected bifunctional intermediate of formula (2). The coupled product can then be deprotected to yield an intermediate of formula (3). Compounds of formula (I) can be obtained by coupling intermediates of formulas (3) and<br>
(4).<br>
Preferably, each coupling reaction is performed in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines (e.g., triethylamine), carbonates (e.g., K2CO3), hydroxides, and mixtures thereof.  The coupling reactions are<br><br>
typically performed in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The coupling sequence of the fragments (l)-(4) can be altered and the compounds of general formula I can be obtained by other methods known in the art.<br>
A compound of formula (I) having a particular stereochemistry for the cyclopentane or cyclopentene ring can be prepared from an optically active 1- amino cyclopentane or 1-aminocyclopentene of formula (2). The optically active compound of formula (2) may be obtained by resolution, asymmetric synthesis, or other method known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be isolated and/or purified, such as by methods known in the art. For example, the compounds can be isolated and/or purified by distilling off the solvent in vacuum and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to a purification method, such as column chromatography on a suitable support material.<br>
Salts can be obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent, e.g., in a chlorinated hydrocarbon (e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbontetrachloride, and the like ) or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol (e.g., ethanol or isopropanol), which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts can then be obtained by filtering, re-precipitating, precipitating with a non-solvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted to the free base by basification or by acidification into the free compounds which, in turn can be converted into other salts.<br>
The compounds can be prepared in pure or substantially pure form by methods known in the art, such as crystallization using solvents such as pentane, diethyl ether, isopropyl ether, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, water or their combinations, or column chromatography using alumina or silica gel and eluting the column with solvents such as hexane, petroleum ether (pet.ether), chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol or their combinations.<br>
Polymorphs of a compound of formula (I) forming part of this invention may b prepared by crystallization of the compound under various conditions (e.g., by varyin temperature of crystallization and/or the rate of cooling) and with various solvents.  Fc<br><br>
example, polymorphs may be obtained by heating or melting the compound followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray diffraction.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
