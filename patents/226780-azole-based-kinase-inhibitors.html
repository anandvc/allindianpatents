				<td>AZOLE-BASED KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the phosphorylation of specific residues<br>
in proteins. In general protein kinases fall into several groups; those which preferentially<br>
phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues, those which preferentially phosphorylate<br>
tyrosine residues and those which phosphorylate both tyrosine and Ser/Thr residues.<br>
Protein kinases are therefore key elements in signal transduction pathways responsible for<br>
transducing extracellular signals, including the action of cytokines on their receptors, to the<br>
nuclei, triggering various biological events. The many roles of protein kinases in normal cell<br>
physiology include cell cycle control and cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell mobility<br>
and mitogenesis.<br>
Protein kinases include, for example, but are not limited to, members of the Protein Tyrosine<br>
Kinase family (FTKs), which in turn can be divided into the cytoplasmic PTKs and the<br>
receptor PTKs (RTKs). The cytoplasmic PTKS include the SRC family, (including: BLK; FGR;<br>
FYN; KCK; LCK; LYN; SRC;YES and YRK); the BRK Family (including: BRK; FKK, SAD; and<br>
SRM); the CSK family (including: CSK and CTK); the BTK family, (including BTK; ITK; TEC;<br>
MKK2 and TXK), the Janus kinase family, (including: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2), the FAK<br>
family (including. FAK and FYK2); the Fee family (including FES and FER), the 2AP70<br>
family (including ZAP70 and SYK); me ACK family (including ACK1 and ACK2); and the<br>
Ab1 family (including ABL and ARC). The RTK family includes the EGF-Reccptor family<br>
(including, EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4); the Insulin Receptor family (including INS-R<br>
and IGF1-R); the FDGF-Reccptor family (including VDGFRo, PDGFRp, CSF1R, KTT, FLK2<br>
); me VEGF-Receptor family (including; FLT1, FLK1 and FLT4V, the FGP-Receptor family<br>
(including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGPR4 ); the CCK4 family (including CCK4); the<br>
MET family (including MET and RON); the TRK family (including TRKA, TRKB, and<br>
TRKC); the AXL family (including AXL, MER, and SKY); the TIE/TEK family (including TIE<br>
and TTE2/TEK); the EPH family (including EFHA1, EPH A2, EPHA3, EPH A4, EPHA5.<br>
EPHA6, EPHA7, EFHA8, EPHB1, EFHB2, EPHB3, EPHB4, EPHB5, EPHB6); the RYK family<br>
(including RYK); the MCK family (including MCK and TYRO10); the ROS family (including<br>
KOS);the RET family (including RET); the LTK family (including LTK" and ALK); the ROR<br><br>
family (including ROR1 and ROR2); The Musk family (including Musk); the LMR family<br>
inducting LMR1, LMR2 and LMR3); and the SuRTKK106 family (including SuRTK106).<br>
Similarly, the serine /threonine specific kinases comprise a number of distinct sub-families,<br>
including; the extracellular signal regulated kinases, (p42/ERK2 and p44/ERKI); c-Jun<br>
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); cAMP-responsive element-binding protein kinases (CREBK);<br>
cAMP-dependent kinase (CAPK); mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase<br>
(MAPK and its relatives); stress-activated protein kinase p38/SAPK2; mitogen-and<br>
stress-activated kinase (MSK); protein kinases, FKA, PKB and PKC inter alia.<br>
Additionally, the genomes of a number of pathogenic organisms possess genes encoding<br>
protein kinases. For example, the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and viruses such<br>
as HPV and Hepatitis viruses appear to bear kinase related genes.<br>
Inappropriately high protein kinase activity has been implicated in many diseases resulting<br>
from abnormal cellular function. This might arise either directly or indirectly, for example by<br>
failure of the proper control mechanisms for the kinase, related for example to mutation,<br>
over-expression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme; or by over- or under-production<br>
of cytokines or growth factors also participating in the transduction of signals upstream or<br>
downstream of the kinase. In all of these instances, selective inhibition of the action of the<br>
kinase might be expected to have a beneficial effect. Diseases where aberrant kinase activity<br>
has been implicated include: diabetes; restenosis; atherosclerosis; fibrosis of the liver and<br>
kidney; ocular diseases; myelo- and lymphoproliforative disorders; cancer such as prostate<br>
cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, leukemia and lymphoma; and,<br>
auto-immune diseases such as Atopic Dermatitis, Asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's<br>
disease, psoriasis, Crouzon syndrome, achondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia.<br>
The JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play a central role in the cytokine<br>
dependent regulation of the proliferation and end function of several important cell types of<br>
the immune system.<br>
A direct comparison of the four currently known mammalian JAK family members reveals<br>
the presence of seven highly conserved domains (Harpur et al.,1992). In seeking a<br>
nomenclature for the highly conserved domains characteristic of this family of PTKs, the<br>
classification used was guided by the approach of Pawson and co-workers (Sadowski et al,<br>
1986) in their treatment of the SRC homology (5H) domains. The domains have been<br>
enumerated accordingly with most C-terminal homology domain designated JAK Homology<br>
domain 1 (JH1). The next domain N-terminal to JH1 is the kinase-related domain,<br>
designated here as the JH2 domain. Each domain is then enumerated up to the JH7 located<br><br>
at the N-tumunus. The high degree of conservation of these JAK homology (JH) domains<br>
suggests that they are each likely to play an important role in the cellular processes in which<br>
these proteins operate. However, the boundaries of the JAK homology domains are<br>
arbitrary, and may or may not define functional domains. Nonetheless, their delineation is a<br>
useful device to aid the consideration of the overall structural similarity of this class of<br>
proteins.<br>
The feature most characteristic of the JAK family of PTKs is the possession of two<br>
kmase-related domains (JH1 and )H2) (Wilks et al., 1991). The putative FIX domain of JAK1<br>
(JH1) contains highly conserved motifs typical of PTK domains, including the presence of a<br>
tyrosine residue at position 1022 located 11 residues C-terminal to sub-domain VII that is<br>
considered diagnostic of membership of the tyroelne-specific class of protein kinases.<br>
Alignment of the human JAK1 PTK domain (255 amino acids), with other members of the<br>
PTK class of proteins revealed homology with other functional PTKs (for example, 28%<br>
identity with c-fes (Wilks and Kurban, 1968) and 37% homology to TRK (Kozrna et al. 1988).<br>
The JH1 domains of each of the JAK family members poseem an interesting idiosyncrasy<br>
within the highly conserved sub-domain VU1 motif (residues 1015 to 1027 in JAK2) that Is<br>
believed to be closo to the active site, and define substrate specificity. The phenylalanine and<br>
tyrosine residues flanking the conserved tryptophan in this motif are unique to the JAK<br>
family of PTKs. Aside from this element, the JH1 domains of each of the members of the JAK<br>
family ore typical FTK domains.<br>
The central role played by the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases in the cytokine<br>
dependent regulation of the proliferation and end function of several important cell types<br>
means that agents which inhibit JAK are useful in the prevention and chemotherapy of<br>
disease states dependant on these enzymes. Potent and specific inhibitors of each of the<br>
currently known four JAK family members will provide a means of inhibiting the action of<br>
those cytokines that drive immune pathologies, such as asthma (e.g. IL-13; JAK1, JAK2), and<br>
leukemia/lymphoma (eg. lL-2: JAK1 and JAK3).<br>
Furthermore, certain types of cancer such as prostate concur develop autocrine production of<br>
certain cytokines as a selectable) mechanism of developing growth and/ or metastatic<br>
potential An example of this is cancer of the prostate, where IL-6 is produced by and<br>
stimulates the growth of prostate cancer cell lines such as TSU and TC3 (Spiotto MT, and<br>
Chung TD, 2000). Interestingly, levels of CL-6 are elevated in sera of patients with metastatic<br>
prostate cancer.<br>
A great deal of literature covers the area of cytokine signalling. The present inventors have<br>
focusscd on the JAK/STAT pathway that is involved in the direct connection of cytokine<br><br>
receptor to target genes (such as cell cycle regulators (e.g. p21) and anti-apoptosis genes<br>
(such as BC1-XL)).<br>
The JAK/STAT Pathway<br>
The delineation of a particularly elegant signal transduction pathway downstream of the<br>
non-protein tyrosine kinase cytokine receptors has recently been achieved. In this pathway<br>
the key components are: (j) A cytokine receptor chain (or chains) such as the Interleukin-4<br>
receptor or the Interferon γreceptor; (ii) a member (or members) of the JAK family of PTKs;<br>
(iii) a mcmber(s) of the STAT family of transcription factors, and (iv) a sequence specific<br>
DNA element to which the activated STAT will bind.<br>
A review of the JAK/STAT literature offers strong support to the notion that this pathway is<br>
important for the recruitment and marshalling of the host immune response to<br>
environmental insults, such as viral and bacterial infection. This is well exemplified in Table<br>
1 and Table 2. Information accumulated from gene knock-out experiments have underlined<br>
the importance of members of the JAK family to the intracellular signalling triggered by a<br>
number of important immune regulatory cytokines. The therapeutic possibilities stemming<br>
from inhibiting (or enhancing) the JAK/STAT pathway are thus largely in the sphere of<br>
immune modulation, and as such are likely to be promising drugs for the treatment of a<br>
range of pathologies in this area. In addition to the diseases listed in Tables 1 and 2,<br>
inhibitors of JAKs could be used as immunosuppresive agents for organ transplants and<br>
autoimmune diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Type I diabetes,<br>
autoimmune thyroid disorders, Alzheimer's disease and other autoimmune diseases.<br>
Additionally/ treatment of cancers such as prostate cancer by JAK inhibitors is indicated.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Compound Synthesis<br>
Compounds are generally prepared in a 2-step process starting from 2,6-dichloropyrazine.<br>
The first step is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate a monoamino-rnonohalo<br>
intermediate. (Scheme 1).<br><br>
The nucleophilic aromatic substitution is typically carried out by addition of a primary<br>
amine to the dishalogenated heterocycle in a solvent such as eyhanol, isopropanol<br>
tert-butanol, dioxsne, THF, DMF, toluene or xylene. The reaction is typically performed at<br>
elevated temperature in the presence of excess amine or a non-nucleophilic base such as<br>
triethylaminc' or disopropylemylomine, or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate or<br>
sodium carbonate.<br><br>
Alternatively, the amino substituent may be introduced through a transition metal catalysed<br>
amination reaction. Typical catalyst- systems for such transformations include<br>
Pd(OAc)2/P(t-Bu)a, Pd2(dba)3/BINAP and Pd(OAc)2/BINAP.<br>
The amines employed in the first step of the synthesis of these compounds are obtained<br>
commercially or are prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Of<br>
particular interest are α-methylbenzylamines which are obtained commercially or may be<br>
prepared through reduction of oximes (Scheme 2). Typical reductants include lithium<br>
aluminium hydride, hydrogen gas in the presence of catalytic palladium on charcoal, Zn in<br>
the presence of hydrochloric acid, sodium borohydride in the presence of a Lewis acid such<br>
as TlCl3 ZrCl4, NiCl2 and MoO3 or sodium borohydride in conjunction with Amberlyst HI 5<br>
ion exchange resin and LIC1. The oximes are obtained in one-step from the corresponding<br>
ketones through condensation with hydroxylamine. This reaction is generally performed in<br>
a protic solvent such as water or ethanol, at temperatures from 0°C to reflux. The<br>
hydroxylamine is generally used in the form of its hydrochloride salt, and therefore the<br>
reaction is performed in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. The ketones<br>
employed as starting materials are generally obtained commercially ox via procedures well<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
α-Methyl benzylamines of high optical purity may be prepared from chiral α-methyl benzyl<br>
alcohols using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods include<br>
dorivatisation of the hydroxy1 as a mesylate or tosylate and displacement with a nitrogen<br>
nucleophile, such as phthalimide or ozidc which can then converted to the primary amine<br>
using conventional synthetic methods; or, displacement of the hydroxyl with a suitable<br>
nitrogen nucleophile under Miteunobu conditions. The chiral cc-methyl benzyl alcohols may<br>
be obtained through chiral reduction of the corresponding ketones. Chiral reducing methods<br>
are now well known in organic chemistry and include enzymatic processes, asymmetric<br>
hydrogenatlon procedures and chiral oxazaborolidines.<br>
The second step of the synthesis involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of the<br>
monochloro- mono-amino pyrazine with benzimidazole or indazole. The reaction is<br><br>
typically performed using a salt of the benzimidazole or indazole in solvents such as<br>
tetrahydroruran, dimethylformamide, toluene, or xylene from room temperature to reflux.<br>
The benzunidazole or indazole salt is prepared by reaction with a metal hydride such as<br>
sodium or potassium hydride or by reaction with caesium carbonate. Alternatively, a<br>
metal-catalysed coupling reaction can be used to introduce the benzimidazole or indazole<br>
ring. The reaction is typically performed using a base such as caesium carbonate, rubidium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium tert-butoxide or potassium phosphate in a solvent<br>
such as xylene, toluene, and DMF from room temperature to reflux. Auxiliary reagents such<br>
as phase transfer agents (e.g. cctrimonlum bromide) or copper complexing agents (e.g.<br>
phenanthroline) may also be employed in the reaction.<br>
The benzlmldazole or indazole components used in mis reaction are obtained commercially<br>
or are prepared from commercially available benzimidazoles or indazoles via techniques<br>
well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, a benzunidazole or indazole derivative may be reacted with the mono-amino<br>
mono-chloro pyrazine and the subsequent product further derivatised using methods well<br>
known to those skilled in the art<br>
Representative syntheses arc reported below.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
A solution of S-(-)-1(4-fluorophenyl)-ethylamine (5.0 g, 35.9 mmol), 2,6-dichloropyrazine<br>
(5.90 g, 39.6 mmol), diisopropylethylamme (12.5 mL, 71.8 mmol) in ethoxyethanol (25 mL)<br>
was heated at 135°C under N2 overnight The solvent was removed in vacuo and the<br>
residue washed with H2O (2 x 30 mL) and dried (Na2SO4). The solvent was removed under<br>
reduced pressure and the residue triturated with hexanes (2 x 10 mL) to give a light brown<br>
solid. The washings were combined, concentrated and the residue obtained<br>
chromatographed using ethyl acetate-hexane (1:4 -1:2) to separate solid product which,<br>
combined with the original solids, gave the total product (7.07 g, 78%).<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
To a stirred solution of benzimidazole (130 mg, 1.1 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (5 mL) at 0°C<br>
under N2 was added sodium hydride (56 mg, 60% dispersion in oil, 1.45 mmol) in portions<br>
over 2 min. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 15 min and at RT for 60 min. To this was<br>
added a solution of (6-chloro-pyrazin-2-yl)-(1-benzyl)-amine (220 mg) in DMF (5 mL) and the<br>
resulting mixture was then heated at reflux for 18h. The DMF was removed under reduced<br>
pressure and the residue diluted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with<br>
water, dried (Na2SO4) and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to furnish the crude<br>
product. Column chromatography using dichloromethane-methanol (20:1 → 10:1) as eluant<br>
separated the product (100mg).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>

A mixture of 2,6-dichloropyrs7.me (2.0 g, 13.4 mmol), 1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide (2,0<br>
g, 12.3 mmol) and cesium carbonate (5.6 g, 17.2 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was heated at 90°C<br>
for 3h. The solution was cooled to RT and diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and filtered.<br>
The solid material was washed with chloroform-mothanol (20mL, 4:1) and the combined<br>
filtrates concentrated in vacuo. The residue thus obtained (3.02 g) was used without further<br>
purification.<br>
