				<td>The   present   inventions   relates   to   a   heterocyclylaminomethyl   substituted oxazolidinone compound of the formula (I)"<br>
The present invention relates to antibiotic compounds and in particular to antibiotic<br>
compounds containing a substituted oxazolidinone ring. This invention further relates to<br>
processes for their preparation, to intermediates useful in their preparationrto their use as<br>
therapeutic agents and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The international microbiological community continues to express serious concern<br>
that the evolution of antibiotic resistance could result in strains against which currently<br>
available antibacterial agents will be ineffective. In general, bacterial pathogens may be<br>
classified as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens. Antibiotic compounds with<br>
effective activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens are generally<br>
regarded as having a broad spectrum of activity. The compounds of the present invention are<br>
regarded as principally effective against Gram-positive pathogens.<br>
Gram-positive pathogens, for example Staphylococci, Enterococci, and Streptococci<br>
are particularly important because of the development of resistant strains which are both<br>
difficult to treat and difficult to eradicate from the hospitafenvironment once established.<br>
Examples of such strains are methicillin resistant staphylococcus (MRSA), methicillin<br>
resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCNS), penicillin resistant Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae and multiply resistant Enterococcus faecium.<br>
The major clinically effective antibiotic for treatment of such resistant Gram-positive<br>
pathogens is vancomycin. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide and is associated with various<br>
toxicities including nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, and most importantly, antibacterial<br>
resistance to vancomycin and other glycopeptides is also appearing. This resistance is<br>
increasing at a steady rate rendering these agents less and less effective in the treatment of<br>
Gram-positive pathogens. There is also now increasing resistance appearing towards agents<br>
such as pMactams, quinolones and macrolides used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract<br>
infections, also caused by certain Gram negative strains including H.influenzae and<br>
M.catarrhalis.<br>
Certain antibacterial compounds containing an oxazolidinone ring have been described<br>
in the art (for example, Walter A. Gregory et al in J.Med.Chem. 1990, 33, 2569-2578 and<br>
Chung-Ho Parle et al in J.Med.Chem. 1992, 35,1156-1165). Such antibacterial oxazolidinone<br>
compounds with a 5-acetamidomethyl side-chain may be subject to mammalian peptidase<br>
metabolism. Furthermore, bacterial resistance to known antibacterial agents may develop, for<br>
example, by (i) the evolution of active binding sites in the bacteria rendering a previously<br>
active pharmacophore less effective or redundant, (ii) the evolution of means to chemically deactivate a given pharmacophore and/or (iii) the development and/or up-regulation of efflux mechanisms. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to find new antibacterial agents with a favourable pharmacological profile, in particular for compounds containing new pharmacophores.<br>
Additionally, certain antibacterial compounds containing an oxazolidinone ring have activity against the enzyme mono-amine oxidase (MAO), for instance compounds with amidomethyl or hydroxymethyl side chains at C-5 of the oxazolidinone ring. This may potentially lead to undesirable properties such as elevation in blood pressure when administered to a patient, or potentially cause drug-drug interactions. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to find new antibacterial agents of the oxazolidinone class with a more favourable profile against MAO.<br>
We have discovered a new class of antibiotic compounds containing an oxazolidinone ring substituted by a 5-azolylmethyl moiety in which the azole group is linked via a nitrogen atom and is itself further substituted. These compounds have useful activity against Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA and MRCNS and, in particular, against various strains exhibiting resistance to vancomycin and against E. faecium strains resistant to both aminoglycosides and clinically used β-lactams, but also to certain fastidious Gram negative strains such as H.influenzae, M.catarrhalis and chlamydial strains. The compounds of the invention also show a favourable, decreased, MAO potency compared with other oxazolidinone analogues from the prior art.<br>
Accordingly in a first aspect, the present invention provides a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, or an in-vivo-hydrolysable ester thereof,<br>

Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include acid addition salts such as methanesulfonate, fumarate, hydrochloride, citrate, maleate, tartrate and (less preferably) hydrobromide. Also suitable are salts formed with phosphoric and sulfuric acid. In another aspect suitable salts are base salts such as an alkali metal salt for example sodium, an alkaline earth metal salt for example calcium or magnesium, an organic amine salt for example triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylethylamine, tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, N-methyl d-glucamine and amino acids such as lysine.

However, to facilitate isolation of the salt during preparation, salts which are less soluble in the chosen solvent may be preferred whether pharmaceutically-acceptable or not.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) may be administered in the form of a pro-drug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the formula (I). A prodrug may be used to alter or improve the physical and/or pharmacokinetic profile of the parent compound and can be formed when the parent compound contains a suitable group or substituent which can be derivatised to form a prodrug. Examples of pro-drugs include in-vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art, for examples see:<br>

i	An in-vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable salt thereof containing a carboxy or hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable ester which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent alcohol.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable esters for carboxy include (l-6C)alkoxymethyl esters for example methoxymethyl, (l-6C)alkanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, (3-8C)cycloalkoxycarbonyloxy(l-6C)alkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl; l,3-dioxolan-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-methyl-l,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl; and (l-6C)alkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1-methoxycarbonyloxyethyl and may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.<br>
Suitable pro-drugs for pyridine derivatives include acyloxymethyl pyridinium salts eg halides; for example a pro-drug such as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
An in-vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof containing a hydroxy group or groups includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters (including phosphoramidic cyclic esters) and a-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in-vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give<br>
the parent hydroxy group/s. Examples of a-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxymethoxy and<br>
2,2-dimethylpropionyloxymethoxy. A selection of in-vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include (l-10C)alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, (l-10C)alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), di-(l-4C)alkylcarbamoyl and N-(di-(l-4C)alkylaminoethyl)-N-(l-4C)alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), di-(l-4C)alkylaminoacetyl, carboxy(2-5C)alkylcarbonyl andcarboxyacetyl. Examples of ring substituents on phenylacetyl and benzoyl include chloromethyl or aminomethyl, (l-4C)alkylaminomethyl and di-((l-4C)alkyl)aminomethyl, and morpholino or piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene linking group to the 3- or 4-position of the benzoyl ring. Other interesting in-vivo hydrolysable esters include, for example, RAC(O)O(l-6C)alkyl-CO- (wherein RA is for example, optionally substituted benzyloxy-(l-4C)alkyl, or optionally substituted phenyl; suitable substituents on a phenyl group in such esters include, for example, 4-(l-4C)piperazino-(l-4C)alkyl, piperazino-(l-4C)alkyl and morpholino-(l-4C)alkyl.<br>
Suitable in-vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (I) are described as follows. For example, a 1,2-diol may be cyclised to form a cyclic ester of formula (PD1) or a pyrophosphate of formula (PD2), and a 1,3-diol may be cyclised to form a cyclic ester of the formula (PD3):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Esters of compounds of formula (I) wherein the HO- function/s in (PD1), (PD2) and (PD3) are protected by (l-4C)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl are useful intermediates for the preparation of such pro-drugs.<br>
Further in-vivo hydrolysable esters include phosphoramidic esters, and also compounds of invention in which any free hydroxy group independently forms a phosphoryl (npd is 1) or phosphiryl (npd is 0) ester of the formula (PD4) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, phosphono is -P(O)(OH)i; (l-4C)alkoxy(hydroxy)-phosphoryl is a mono-(l-4C)alkoxy derivative of-O-P(O)(OH)2; and di-(l-4C)alkoxyphosphoryl is a di-(l-4C)alkoxy derivative of -0-P(O)(OH)2.<br>
Useful intermediates for the preparation of such esters include compounds containing a group/s of formula (PD4) in which either or both of the -OH groups in (PD1) is independently protected by (l-4C)alkyl (such compounds also being interesting compounds in their own right), phenyl or phenyl-(l-4C)alkyl (such phenyl groups being optionally substituted by 1 or 2 groups independently selected from (l-4C)alkyl, nitro, halo and (l-4C)alkoxy).<br>
Thus, prodrugs containing groups such as (PD1), (PD2), (PD3) and (PD4) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of invention containing suitable hydroxy group/s with a suitably protected phosphorylating agent (for example, containing a chloro or dialkylamino leaving group), followed by oxidation (if necessary) and deprotection.<br>
Other suitable prodrugs include phosphonooxymethyl ethers and their salts, for example a prodrug of R-OH such as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
When a compound of invention contains a number of free hydroxy group, those groups not being converted into a prodrug functionality may be protected (for example, using a t-butyl-dimethylsilyl group), and later deprotected. Also, enzymatic methods may be used to selectively phosphorylate ordephosphorylate alcohol functionalities.<br>
Where pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of an in-vivo hydrolysable ester may be formed this is achieved by conventional techniques. Thus, for example, compounds containing a group of formula (PD1), (PD2), (PD3)and/or (PD4) may ionise (partially or fully) to form salts with an appropriate number of counter-ions. Thus, by way of example, if an in-vivo hydrolysable ester prodrug of a compound of invention contains two (PD4) groups, there are four HO-P- functionalities present in the overall molecule, each of which may form<br>
an appropriate salt (i.e. the overall molecule may form, for example, a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-<br>
sodium salt).<br>
The compounds of the present invention have a chiral centre at the C-5 position of the oxazolidinone ring. The pharmaceutically active enantiomer is of the formula (IA):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The present invention includes the pure enantiomer depicted above or mixtures of the 5R and 5S enantiomers, for example a racemic mixture. If a mixture of enantiomers is used, a larger amount (depending upon the ratio of the enantiomers) will be required to achieve the same effect as the same weight of the pharmaceutically active enantiomer. The enantiomer depicted above may be the 5(R) or 5(S) enantiomer depending on the nature of the N-HET group (for example, when -N-HET is imidazole it is the 5(S) enantiomer).<br>
Furthermore, some compounds of the formula (I) may have other chiral centres, for example, certain sulfoxide compounds may be chiral at the sulfur atom. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such optical and diastereo-isomers, and racemic mixtures, that possess antibacterial activity. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically-active forms (for example by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallisation techniques, by chiral synthesis, by enzymatic resolution, by biotransformation or by chromatographic separation) and how to determine antibacterial activity as described hereinafter.<br>
Furthermore, some compounds of the formula (I), for example certain sulfoxide compounds may exist as cis- and trans- isomers. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such isomers, and mixtures thereof, that possess antibacterial activity.<br>
The invention relates to all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula (I) that possess antibacterial activity.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula (I) can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which possess antibacterial activity.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula (I) may exhibit<br>
polymorphism, and that the invention encompasses all such forms which possess antibacterial activity.<br>

Process section :<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in-vivo hydrolysable ester thereof. It will be appreciated that during certain of the following processes certain substituents may require protection to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place, and later removed.<br>
For examples of protecting groups see one of the many general texts on the subject, for example, 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons). Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method as described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.<br>
Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or r-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a r-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine. A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an<br>
arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting<br>
groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a r-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
Resins may also be used as a protecting group.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
A compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes, when used to prepare a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are illustrated by the following representative examples. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry (see, for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley-Interscience), Jerry March). The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples (in which, for example, 3,5-difluorophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl and (des-fluoro)phenyl containing intermediates may all be prepared by analagous procedures; or by alternative procedures - for example, the preparation of (T group)-(fluoro)phenyl intermediates by reaction of a (fluoro)phenylstannane with, for example, a pyran or (tetrahydro)pyridine compound, may also be prepared by anion chemistry (see, for example, WO97/30995). Alternatively, necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist.

(a)      Methods for converting substituents into other substituents are known in the art. For example an alkylthio group may be oxidised to an alkylsulfinyl or alkysulfonyl group, a cyano group reduced to an amino group, a nitro group reduced to an amino group, a hydroxy group alkylated to a methoxy group, a hydroxy group thiomethylated to an arylthiomethyl or a heteroarylthiomethyl group (see, for example, Tet.Lett., 585, 1972), a carbonyl group converted to a thiocarbonyl group (eg. using Lawsson's reagent) or a bromo group converted to an alkylthio group. It is also possible to convert one Re group into another Re group as a final step in the preparation of a compound of the formula (I), for example, acylation of a group of formula (TC5) wherein Re is hydrogen.<br>
(b)( i) Reaction (b)(i) (in which Y is initially hydroxy) is performed under Mitsunobu conditions, for example, in the presence of tri-n-butylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) in an organic solvent such as THF, and in the temperature range 0°C - 60°C, but<br>
preferably at ambient temperature. Details of Mitsunobu reactions are contained in Tet. Letts.,<br>
3_L 699, (1990); The Mitsunobu Reaction, D.L.Hughes, Organic Reactions, 1992, Vol.42, 335-656 and Progress in the Mitsunobu Reaction, D.L.Hughes, Organic Preparations and Procedures International, 1996, Vol.28,127-164.<br>
Compounds of the formula (II) wherein Y is hydroxy may be obtained as described in the references cited herein (particularly in the section proceeding the discussion of protecting groups), for example, by reacting a compound of the formula (X) with a compound of formula (XI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R21 is (l-6C)alkyl or benzyl and R22 is (l-4C)alkyl or -S(O)n(l-4C)alkyl where n is 0, 1 or 2. Preferably R22 is (l-4C)alkyl.<br>
In particular, compounds of the formula (H), (X) and (XI) may be prepared by the skilled man, for example as described in International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO95/07271, WO97/27188, WO 97/30995, WO 98/01446 and WO 98/01447, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, and by analogous processes.<br>
If not commercially available, compounds of the formula (HI) may be prepared by procedures which are selected from standard chemical techniques, techniques which are analogous to the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques which are analogous to the procedures described in the Examples. For example, standard chemical techniques are as described in Houben Weyl, Methoden der Organische Chemie, E8a, Pt.I (1993), 45-225, BJ.Wakefield.<br>
(b)( ii) Reactions (b)(ii) are performed conveniently in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate, alkoxide or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, or, for example, an organic amine base such as, for<br>
example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine,<br>
morpholine or diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, the reaction is also preferably carried out in a suitable inert solvent or diluent, for example methylene chloride, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulfoxide at and at a temperature in the range 25-60°C.<br>
When Y is chloro, the compound of the formula (II) may be formed by reacting a compound of the formula (II) wherein Y is hydroxy (hydroxy compound) with a chlorinating agent. For example, by reacting the hydroxy compound with thionyl chloride, in a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux, optionally in a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane or by reacting the hydroxy compound with carbon tetrachloride/triphenyl phosphine in dichloromethane, in a temperature range of 0°C to ambient temperature. A compound of the formula (II) wherein Y is chloro or iodo may also be prepared from a compound of the formula (II) wherein Y is mesylate or tosylate, by reacting the latter compound with lithium chloride or lithium iodide and crown ether, in a suitable organic solvent such as THF, in a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux<br>
When Y is (l-4C)alkanesulfonyloxy or tosylate the compound (II) may be prepared by reacting the hydroxy compound with (l-4C)alkanesulfonyl chloride or tosyl chloride in the presence of a mild base such as triethylamine or pyridine.<br>
When Y is a phosphoryl ester (such as (PhO)2-P(O)-O-) or Ph2-P(O)-O- the compound (II) may be prepared from the hydroxy compound under standard conditions, (c)       Reaction (c) is performed under conditions analogous to those described in the following references which disclose how suitable and analogous starting materials may be obtained.<br>
Reaction (c) is especially suitable for compounds in which HET-H is a weakly acidic heterocycle (such as, for example, triazole or tetrazole).<br>

Chem. 1990,33, 2569-2578 and Chung-Ho Park et al in J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35,1156-1165. Compounds of the formula Q-Z wherein Z is a urethane may be prepared by the skilled chemist, for example by analogous processes to those described in International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 97/30995 and WO 97/37980.<br>
A similar reaction to reaction (c) may be performed in which Q-Z wherein Z is a amine group is reacted with the epoxide (optionally in the presence of an organic base), and<br>
the product is reacted with, for example, phosgene to form the oxazolidinone ring. Such<br>
reactions and the preparation of starting materials in within the skill of the ordinary chemist with reference to the above-cited documents disclosing analogous reactions and preparations.<br>
Epoxides of the formula (V) may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula (XII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Certain such epoxide and alkene intermediates are novel and are provided as a further feature of the invention. Asymmetric epoxidation may be used to give the desired optical isomer. Compounds of formula (VI) may be obtained from epoxides of formula (V); alternatively compounds of formula (VI) may be used as precursors for epoxides of formula (V) according to the relative ease of synthesis in each case. The skilled chemist will appreciate that the epoxides of formula (V) and the compounds of formula (VI) are structurally equivalent and the choice between them will be made on the grounds of availability, convenience, and cost.<br>

Tetrahedron, 1998, 54, 263-303).  The reaction d (ii) may be conveniently carried out under<br>
the conditions described Tetrahedron Letters (2001), 42(22), 3681-3684, or in the analogous<br>
conventional conditions described in the above mentioned literature. In such a procedure a<br>
preferred variation of X may be bromine.<br>
