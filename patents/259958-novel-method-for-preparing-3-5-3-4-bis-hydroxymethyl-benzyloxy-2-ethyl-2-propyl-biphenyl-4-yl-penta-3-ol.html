				<td>Novel process for the preparation of 3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol<br>
The   present  invention   relates   to  a   process   for  the   preparation   of  3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol of formula:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The compounds of the family of the above 3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol and their use in human medicine have been described by the Applicant Company in Patent WO 03/050067.<br>
In this patent application, the synthesis of 3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol is carried out in 17 stages. The majority of the intermediates generated in this synthesis are purified by chromatography on a silica column, making it difficult to manufacture this product on a large scale. In addition, due to this large number of stages, the overall yield of this synthesis is very low, less than 0.5%, and the manufacturing times are very long.<br>
In the present invention, the Applicant Company has developed a novel process for the preparation of 3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol in four stages, making it possible to overcome the problems stated above, according to the scheme of Figure 1.<br>
The invention thus relates to a process for the preparation of 3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol, characterized in that it comprises the following stages:<br>
a)	conversion     of     1-(4-hydroxy-3-propylphenyl)propan-1-one      to     give<br>
trifluoromethanesulphonic acid 4-propionyl-2-(n-propyl)phenyl ester, folIowed in situ by<br>
a reaction of Suzuki type with 2-ethyl-5-methoxyphenylboronic acid;<br>
b)	demethylation of 1-(2'-ethyl-5'-methoxy-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one<br>
by heating with an excess of pyridine salts;<br>
c)	conversion  of 1-(2'-ethyl-5'-hydroxy-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one to<br>
give    6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol     by    reaction    with<br>
ethylmagnesium bromide or ethyllithium;<br>
d)	condensation   of 6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propy!biphenyl-3-ol<br>
with dimethyl 4-(bromomethyl)phthalate, followed in situ by a reduction reaction with<br>
lithium borohydride.<br>
More specifically, the process according to the invention comprises the following detailed stages:<br>
- The first stage of this process (stage a) above or 101 in Figure 1) is a one pot reaction for the conversion of 1-(4-hydroxy-3-propylphenyl)propan-1-one (prepared according to Demerseman et al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1963, 2559-2562, or Stoughton, Baltzly and Bass, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 56, 1934, 2007) by reaction with trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride (Tf2O) in the presence of triethylamine (NEt3) to give its derivative trifluoromethanesulphonic acid 4-propionyl-2-(n-propyl)phenyl ester, followed by an in situ condensation of Suzuki type with 2-ethyl-5-methoxyphenylboronic acid (prepared according to a process described in Patent Application FR 2 863 613) in the presence of K2CO3 and of a catalytic amount of PdCI2(PPh3)2 or Pd(PPh3)4.<br>
This one pot reaction  is carried  out in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran  (THF),<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF), aromatic solvents, such as toluene, ethereal solvents, such<br>
as diisopropyl ether, halogenated solvents, such as chloroform, or alkanes, such as<br>
pentane, hexane or heptane. The solvents preferably used in this reaction are DMF<br>
and/or toluene.<br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures of between 5 and 140°C, preferably at<br>
120°C.<br>
The amounts of catalyst PdCI2(PPh3)2 or Pd(PPh3)4 used in this reaction can vary between 0.001 and 0.05 molar equivalent with respect to the amount of 1-(4-hydroxy-3-propylphenyl)propan-1-one. Use will preferably be made of between 0.01 and 0.05 molar equivalent of PdCI2(PPh3)2 or Pd(PPh3)4.<br>
-	In the second stage (stage b) above or I02 in Figure 1), 1-(2'-ethyl-5'-methoxy-2-<br>
propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one  is  subjected to a  demethylation  reaction with  a<br>
pyridine salt. The reaction is carried out without solvent at temperatures of between 80<br>
and 200°C, preferably at 170°C.<br>
The pyridine salts used in this reaction can be the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide or the hydriodide and can vary between 1 and 10 molar equivalents. Preferably, 5 molar equivalents will be used.<br>
-	The third stage (stage c) above or I03 in Figure 1) is the conversion of 1-(2'-ethyl-5'-<br>
hydroxy-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one to give a novel compound, 6-ethyI-4'-(1-<br>
ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol,     by    reaction    with    ethylmagnesium<br>
bromide or with ethyllithium.<br>
The solvents preferably used in this reaction are ethers, such as ethyl ether, tert-butyl<br>
dimethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures of between -20°C and 20°C, preferably at<br>
0°C.<br>
The amounts of ethylmagnesium bromide or of ethyllithium used in this reaction can<br>
vary between 2 and 5 molar equivalents. Preferably, 2.2 molar equivalents will be used.<br>
-	In the following stage (stage d) above or I04 in Figure 1), 6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-<br>
hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyI-3-ol       is       condensed       with       dimethyl       4-<br>
(bromomethyl)phthalate (prepared according to a method analogous to that described<br>
by E.H. White, D.F. Roswell and O.C. Zafiriou in J. Org. Chem., 34 (8), 2462-2468,<br>
1969, and J.W. Leon, M. Kawa and J.M.J. Frechet in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 118, 8847-<br>
8859, 1996) in the presence of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) in tetrahydrofuran at<br>
reflux. The two carboxyl functional groups are subsequently reduced in situ by the<br>
addition of lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and then heating at reflux of the tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The first reaction can be catalysed by phase transfer agents, such as Aliquat 336 or<br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide, in the presence of potassium iodide.The  present  invention  also  relates  to  the  novel  compound   6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol with the structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and to its process of manufacture.<br>
The invention thus also relates to the process for the conversion of 1 -(2'-ethyl-5'-<br>
hydroxy-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one         to        give         6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-<br>
hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol by reaction with ethylmagnesium bromide or with<br>
ethyllithium.<br>
The solvents preferably used in this reaction are ethers, such as ethyl ether, tert-butyl<br>
dimethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures of between -20°C and 20°C, preferably at<br>
0°C. The amounts of ethylmagnesium bromide or of ethyllithium used in this reaction<br>
can vary between 2 and 5 molar equivalents. Preferably, 2.2 molar equivalents will be<br>
used.<br>
After      treatment,       6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol       is<br>
crystallized from diisopropyl ether or dichloromethane, making it possible to obtain this<br>
product with a purity of greater than 99%.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of 6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol in the preparation of 3-[5'-{3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol.<br>
By way of example, without any limiting nature, a description of the process which makes it possible to prepare 3-[5'-(3,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzyloxy)-2'-ethyl-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl]pentan-3-ol will be found below.<br>

203 g of 1-(4-hydroxy-3-propylphenyl)propan-1-one and 1 litre of toluene are charged to a 4 litre reactor under nitrogen. The medium is cooled to approximately -5°C and then the rapid addition is carried out of 176 ml of triethylamine and then of 196 ml of trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride over 1 hour at between -5°C and +1°C. After stirring for 30 min, 1 litre of a 2M K2CO3 solution is introduced, followed by 190 g of 2-ethyl-5-methoxyphenylboronic acid in solution in 610 ml of dimethylformamide. 12 g of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) are added and the reaction medium is heated at reflux for 2 h. After being brought back to ambient temperature, the reaction medium is washed 3 times with 610 ml of a saturated NH4CI solution and then with 610 ml of water. The solvents are evaporated from the organic phase under vacuum. The crude product obtained is taken up in 1 volume of dichloromethane, which is deposited on 3 times its weight of silica. Elution is carried out with 16 volumes of methylene chloride. After evaporating the solvent, 335 g of 1-(2'-ethyl-5'-hydroxy-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one are obtained (beige oil; 100% yield).<br>

370 g (1.248 mol) of 1-(2'-ethyl-5'-hydroxy-2-propylbiphenyl-4-yl)propan-1-one in solution in 3.7 litres of tetrahydrofuran are placed in a reactor. 915 ml of a 3M solution of ethylmagnesium bromide in ethyl ether are slowly run into this solution cooled to -10°C. At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture is kept stirred for 1 hour and then transferred onto 5 litres of a 2.5 molar solution of ammonium chloride in water. The organic phase is separated by settling and washed twice with 800 ml of water. After evaporating under reduced vacuum, the residue is dissolved with 2.75 litres of methylene chloride at reflux. The medium is allowed to return to ambient temperature<br>
with stirring and is then cooled to 5°C. The crystals are filtered off and then dried under vacuum. 260 g (64%) of 6-ethyl-4'-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl)-2'-propylbiphenyl-3-ol are obtained.<br>
