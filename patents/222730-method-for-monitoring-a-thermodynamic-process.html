				<td>The invention relates to a method for monitoring a thermodynamic process in<br>
an installation.<br>
In a known method of this type, first specific features for image evaluation<br>
are defined which appear to be promising to the operator of the installation<br>
for modeling the process. For example, one defines specific moments and<br>
then reproduces the image material on this - necessarily reduced - functions<br>
system. The selected features - and only these - are then examined and used<br>
for creating a process model. Optionally, only parts of the information<br>
contained in the image material are extracted and used.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of improving a method of the<br>
type mentioned above.<br>
Since the image evaluation is based on an eigen value problem for an<br>
approach, at least for the largest part of the high-dimensional image space,<br>
the information contained in the images can be transformed into a lower-<br>
dimensional space for evaluation, without any significant loss of information.<br>
The images are then represented by means of characteristic image features<br>
(,,eigen flames") resulting from the eigen value problem. Image evaluation is<br>
done automatically, the evaluation approach being intrinsic to the system and<br>
not depending on features selected by the operator of the installation.<br>
Preferably, singular events which may significantly impair the process, are<br>
taken into account for solving the eigen value problem, so that they can be<br>
identified more quickly in subsequent image evaluations.<br>
A typical thermodynamic process serves to transform material, the necessary<br>
temperature being generated and maintained by a combustion process having at<br>
least one flame. Simultaneous capture of the flame and the material in the<br>
image material, i.e. of the radiation emitted by the flame and the material, has<br>
the advantage of providing information on the interaction between the flame<br>
and the material in a unique manner. It is then possible to subject the<br>
description of one entire scene to image evaluation. The environment of the<br>
flame is preferably complemented by also capturing the walls of the<br>
combustion chamber, i.e. their emissions.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below by means of three exemplary<br>
embodiments illustrated in the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a basic draft, partially in sectional view, of an installation for<br>
producing cement according to a first exemplary embodiment,<br>
Fig. 2 is a simplified camera image of the installation in Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic representation of a garbage incinerator installation<br>
according to a second exemplary embodiment,<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic representation of a power plant furnace installation<br>
according to a third exemplary embodiment as longitudinal section,<br>
Fig. 5 is a corresponding horizontal transverse section, and<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic representation of the image material in the third<br>
exemplary embodiment.<br>
In all three exemplary embodiments, a thermodynamic process runs in an<br>
installation, in which, at least partially, combustible material G is subjected to<br>
oxidation by the adduction of air L, there being at least one flame F. The<br>
thermodynamic process is to be monitored and then regulated in such a way as<br>
to have, on the on the one hand, a certain stability and, on the other hand, a<br>
certain flexibility, i.e. adapting itself to different conditions, there being certain<br>
optimization goals. The condition in the installation is described by different<br>
process parameters, some of which are also control parameters. By actions, i.e.<br>
by changing control parameters, the condition of the installation is modified.<br>
For on-line monitoring and control as well as forecasts of future conditions of<br>
the installation, a neuronal network is implemented in a data processing unit 1.<br>
By means of at least one camera 3, images of the thermodynamic process are<br>
captured. The camera 3 is set in such a way that it captures both the flame F<br>
and the burning material G, preferably also the walls 7 of the combustion<br>
chamber including cakings B, if applicable, i.e. the emissions from the entire<br>
environment. The image material 5 produced by the camera 3 thus contains the<br>
description of one entire scene also including the interaction between the flame<br>
F and the material G. The image material 5 is fed into a data processing unit 1,<br>
whereby, on the one hand, a live video image is displayed and, on the other<br>
hand, some process parameters are computed from the information contained<br>
in the image material 5.<br>
In order to process the information in the image material 5 in an intelligent way<br>
without loss of information, i.e. due to its complexity in order to transform it<br>
first into a low-dimensional space, one selects, at least in large part, an eigen<br>
value problem for an approach, i.e. one attempts a kind of principal component<br>
analysis. Each image is then described by a (usually) small number of scalar<br>
eigen values (mostly fewer than 20, for example eight), i.e. of transformed<br>
coordinates in the new coordinate system, and of vectorial eigen images or<br>
eigen flames, i.e. by coordinate axes for the new coordinate system, the eigen<br>
flames with the highest values dominating according to the system. The term of<br>
eigen flames must be interpreted in a large sense, since the emissions are not<br>
only included from the flame F, but also from the material G.<br>
In a classical principal component analysis, the zero digits of the characteristic<br>
polynom of the co-variance matrix would have to be calculated. In order to<br>
maintain the system of orthonormal eigen flames, one can alternatively use a<br>
stochastic approximation method in a neuronal network, first randomly<br>
initializing the weightings of all neurons and then, using the image material,<br>
iteratively first adapting the weightings of the first neuron, the second neuron,<br>
etc.<br>
The eigen flames show up mostly as compact regions, since adjacent pixels<br>
also monitor adjacent vectors of the combustion chamber whose light<br>
emissions are strongly correlated. In addition to some average luminosity<br>
distributions, singular events are also selected from the captured images as an<br>
eigen flame approach for the eigen value problem, for example a sudden<br>
adduction of new material G.<br>
Using the process parameters to be computed by means of the - at least in<br>
large part solved - eigen value problem, a process model is created in the<br>
neuronal network, by means of which one can improve the precision of the<br>
forecasts. With this approach, any singular event can be quickly detected, so<br>
that different additional measurements can then be started in order to obtain<br>
more information on the present process status following the singular event.<br>
Since the image evaluation no longer depends on a pre-determined selection<br>
of parameters, but itself extracts suitable information from the image material<br>
5, the image evaluation can be automatized. In addition, the risk of not<br>
factoring in relevant information contained in the image material 5 is clearly<br>
reduced. The simultaneous consideration of emissions from the material G in<br>
the image material 5 provides information which, in its interaction with the<br>
flame F, cannot be obtained in any other way. By means of the chosen<br>
approach using image material 5 captured at different intervals, the eigen<br>
value problem takes developments in time into account.<br>
The first exemplary embodiment relates to a rotary kiln 11 for the production<br>
of cement, being operated in a well-known manner. The camera 3 is focused<br>
on the inside of the rotary kiln 11, capturing the image of the flame F of a<br>
burner 13, of the material being transformed G as well as of the walls 7<br>
including cakings B . The data processing unit 1 subjects the image material 5<br>
from the camera 3 to the described eigen value approach. The neuronal<br>
network, in addition to the compressed data, also receives information on the<br>
mass flows of the air L adducted via different pathways, on the fuel and the<br>
material G. The optimization goal, on the one hand, is a high FCAO value of<br>
the produced clinker K, said FCAO value being determined not only from the<br>
condition inside the rotary kiln 11, but also from the conditions on the cooling<br>
path 15. On the other, the mixture of the fuel is to be set in such a way that a<br>
maximum of secondary fuel, i.e. waste, is used up. Finally, the cakings B on<br>
the walls 7 of the rotary kiln 11 are also to be kept at a minimum.<br>
The second exemplary embodiment concerns a garbage incinerator 21. Here as<br>
well, the camera 3, preferably several cameras, capture the image of the flame<br>
F and material G as one common frame. In a special embodiment for hazardous<br>
waste incineration, garbage containers 23 containing hazardous waste are<br>
dumped into the garbage incinerator 21 a certain intervals. The burst of such a<br>
waste container 23, due to the high temperature, is a singular event which is<br>
quickly detected by means of the eigen value approach according to the<br>
invention. Several additional measurements can then be initiated, such as<br>
taking a sample, in order to obtain more information on the present process<br>
status following said singular event. Preferably, as soon as the door through<br>
which the garbage container 23 is dumped is opened, a high speed camera is<br>
started, providing additional image material 5 at shorter intervals, shortly<br>
before and after the singular event.<br>
The third exemplary embodiment concerns a power plant in which, in addition<br>
to the air L, fuel 33, for example ground coal, is fed into a furnace 31 via the<br>
corners of the furnace 31, indicated by double arrows. A huge, rotary flame F<br>
forms inside the furnace 31. Several cameras 3 are arranged, for example, at<br>
three different levels on each side of the furnace 31. Each camera 3 captures<br>
the flame F as well as the adduction area for the fuel 33 in one scene,<br>
particularly the entry of the fuel 33 into the flame F providing interesting<br>
information, since, as a rule, for the fuel 33 - as opposed to the air L - only the<br>
total mass flow from the coal grinder can be measured, but not the partial flows<br>
to the individual adduction areas. The image material 5 displays the two-<br>
dimensional x-y frames of the cameras 3 combined to one x'-y' instantaneous<br>
image at different times t, i.e. a three-dimensional field. The image material 5,<br>
which is thus (as in the other exemplary embodiments as well) quasi three-<br>
dimensional, is subjected to the described eigen value approach.<br>
