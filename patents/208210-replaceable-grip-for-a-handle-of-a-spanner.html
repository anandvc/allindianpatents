REPLACEABLE GRIP FOR A HANDLE OF A SPANNER TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to the sector of the replaceable grips for handles of spanners, particularly for handles of adjustable spanners.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fixed and adjustable spanners are well known which incorporate a grip on the handle, generally made of rubber or plastic material, in order to provide a holding surface with a high coefficient of friction with the user's hand. The grip normally covers a part of the handle, from an area close to the head of the spanner to another area close to the end of the handle, or else, covers the handle from an area close to the head to the end of the handle. In this last case the grip also includes the hole which the metal handle generally has at its end and which is employed for hanging up the spanner when not being used.<br>
In any case, the grip must have a design or shape with ergonomic characteristics in order that it may be used in a simple manner and may be grasped appropriately, adapting to the different positions of the hand.<br>
For the adapting and securing of the grip on the handle, it has been foreseen, according to a known solution, that the handle has a lowered transversal section, from an area close to the head of the spanner to an area close to the end of the spanner. On this lowered area of the handle the grip is inserted or coupled and is secured longitudinally by the stops that the end walls of said recessed area define. Securing against twisting effects can be achieved by the application of an adhesive.<br>
The most important drawback of this type of spanners is that the spanner cannot be employed without its grip. In the event that the latter becomes worn down through<br><br>
-2-<br>
use, or for whatever accidental circumstance (for example, the spanner is dropped on the floor or deformation from being too close to a source of high temperature), the spanner cannot be employed adequately because the handle has, over almost all its length, a lowered area making holding uncomfortable and not functional in comparison with the traditional or ergonomic handles which do not have said lowered area.<br>
On the other hand, there is a part of the handle, specifically the end thereof, which is not covered by the grip, whereby the holding characteristics are diminished precisely in the area that the user tends to grasp in order to be able to apply a greater operating force with the spanner.<br>
A second solution known consists in that the handle, contrary to the previous case, has no lowering, and the grip is placed over the handle from an area close to the head of the spanner to an area close to the end of the handle. In this case the securing of the grip to the handler in order to withstand longitudinal and twisting effects is achieved by means of an adhesive.<br>
In this second solution the above mentioned drawbacks remain with regard to the grasping conditions, since the end of the handle is not covered by the grip. Even though the spanner can be used without the grip, the user must proceed to dismantle the grip and to adapt the handle, by means of operations which are neither quick nor simple. It is to be borne in mind that the grip is joined to the handle by means of an adhesive and the separation therefore must be carried out against the force of adherence of the adhesive and, subsequently, the layer of adhesive covering the handle shall have to be eliminated.<br>
A third solution known consists in that the handle has a lowered transversal section from an area close the<br><br>
-3-<br>
head of the spanner to the opposite end inclusive, that is in its entirety, since the grip is placed on top of the handle covering also the end thereof. The securing of the grip to the handle in order to withstand the longitudinal and twisting forces is achieved by means of an adhesive.<br>
In this third case the drawbacks of the first solution are further accentuated, in as much as the spanner cannot be employed without its grip, since in this third case the handle has the lowered area over its full length, making holding uncomfortable and not functional in comparison with the traditional or ergonomic handles which do not have that lowered area. Additionally, the dismantling of the grip presents the problems described in relation with the second solution.<br>
Finally, a fourth solution known consists in that the handle of the spanner is of a traditional or ergonomic shape and the grip is placed on top of the handle from the area close to the head to the opposite end thereof inclusive, that is, on its entirety, and is adapted to the shape of the handle, handle and grip being joined by means of an adhesive material.<br>
In this fourth case, when the grip is detached or loosened from the handle or this becomes worn down, the user can employ the spanner without a grip without difficulty, given that it does not have a lowering and has a traditional or ergonomic shape, but however replacement of the grip is not foreseen and in any case, the replacement, which involves both the dismantling of the grip and the mounting of the new grip, cannot be carried out by the user in a quick and simple manner.<br><br>

Patent US 3,018,497 disc[oses a particular construction, arrangement, combination, and relationship of the various elements, components and instrumentalities of a handle construction for the tangs or shanks of bladed tools, such as putty knives, wall scrapers or the like. The invention may be embodied in any device having a handle construction affording an ample grip for the user of the tool. The handle construction includes a pair of metal members, called shells, which are recessed on their outer sides and have inserts seated therein. The shells are superposed on opposite sides of a tang, and with the inserts seated therein, are riveted to the tang so as to form a rigid and strong handle structure. The shells each have bottom longitudinal side, upper, and rear end walls with bolster portions at the inner forward ends thereof. The walls forming the shells preferentially are relatively thin, are formed from stiff metal, are made to provide the desired strength and rigidity, and are shaped to provide a desirable hand grip. The bolster portions are extremely rigid and strong, as is necessary in tools of the type to which the invention relates. The parts are readily and easily assembled in the manufacture of the tool, and the means securing the components to the tang provide a tight construction not likely to become loose in the use thereof.<br>
Patent US 4,524,514 shows a combination of a tool and a hollow tool sectional handle with the following two novel features. The shells forming the handle halves have mating side edges, and these are provided with complementary interlocking projections which preferably include alternating hole-projection-hole on one edge of each shell and projection-hole-projection on the other edge allowing each handle half to mate with any other to form the composite handle encompassing the tang of the blade. Other<br><br>
-4A-<br>
arrangements may also be used. The projections are preferably molded in the form of truncated cones or pyramids for easily piloting into the holes, in turn providing easier assembly and better alignment of the two halves of the handle. Other forms of projections may be used, e.g. oval, cylindrical, square or multi-sided, with or without tapered ends. The fastener for the two shell-like handle halves simplifies assembly as well as providing for more flexing of the tool before loosening thereby lengthening the tool life, and helping to prevent gaps along the mating line of the handle halves. The fastener is a threaded or like device that is pressed into a hole in each handle that is smaller in diameter that the fastener. The handle halves are plastic with a degree of "memory", so that after the fastener is seated, the plastic material of the handle tends to flow inwardly from a displaced position into the spaces between threads, or annuli, etc., making a very strong permanent securement of the handle halves together, encompassing the tang.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the state of the art   by   means   of a replaceable   grip for  spanner handles,   particularly for<br><br><br>
-5-<br>
handles of adjustable spanners, which offers a high coefficient of friction by being of a thermoplastic material, rubber or similar, which fits tightly over the outline of the metallic handle, wrapping round its end and such that this hole for hanging is covered and free and that it is easy to replace.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a replaceable grip for a spanner handle, particularly that of an adjustable spanner, with a handle with a first end provided with a hole for hanging, the grip comprising a body open at one of its ends, of a material at least semi-elastic selected from among plastic materials, thermoplastic materials and rubbers, adapted internally at least to part of the section of the handle, and means of securing to secure the body of the handle, characterised in that<br>
the body of the grip comprises,<br>
a through-hole in a position coincident with the handle hole for hanging,<br>
a blind internal axial void with a double "T" cross section adapted to the cross section of the handle at different points of the handle contour,<br>
the first means of securing comprise flat blocking elements that each cover at least opposite rims of said through-hole,<br>
means of securing which penetrate into the through-hole tightening the blocking elements against the grip.<br>
According to the invention, the blocking elements can be joined to the grip by means of an adhesive and, preferentially,the blockking elements are each mounted in axial recesses provided on each side of the body, the through-hole being arranged in said recesses in such a manner that, preferentially, the exposed faces of the blocking means, are flush with the rest of the grip surface, providing continuity for the primary ergonomic<br><br>
-6-<br>
form.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention at least one of the blocking elements, though preferably both, is a blocking plate arranged axially on the handle. Such blocking plates permit the grip to reach a resistance, being reached precisely through the stiffness of the plates which constitute a reinforcement of the material of the grip, and their securing of the grip can be optimised by the application of an adhesive in the recesses in order that the plates are stuck to the grip.<br>
On the other hand, according to another embodiment, combinable with the embodiment in which only one of the blocking elements is a blocking plate, at least one of the blocking elements is an outer edge of a socket.<br>
Furthermore, and according to another embodiment of the invention, combinable with any of the embodiments described above, at least one of the blocking elements is a blocking washer.<br>
The blocking elements against the grip can comprise a male socket and a female socket coupled to each other in the hole for hanging. According to this embodiment, one or the two male and female sockets can be independent elements or emerge from one of the blocking plates, as for example from a male plate from which emerges the male socket and a female plate from which emerges the female socket. In this embodiment the sockets can each have free rims with male-female interconnection means, whilst at their other end they can be provided with thickenings which fit in the hole for hanging of the spanner handle.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, at least one of the blocking elements against the grip is a socket which emerges from a blocking plate, the socket being retained in the hole for hanging by pressure. This form of embodiment avoids an elastic coupling and a direct contact between plastic elements (the plates) and the<br><br>
-7-<br>
metal handle of the spanner, thereby preventing certain frictions, vibrations and noises during handling by the user, and the subseguent sensation that something is coining loose on the inside of the grip. In this case the sockets are not of the male and female type and conseguently are not intended to be interconnected, but both plates are identical, flat and each has only one socket preferentially short in length which are inserted into the openings of the through-hole of the grip and so into the hole for hanging of the spanner, with the particularity that they do not manage to establish contact with each other though both penetrate to an equal extent into the hole in the core of the spanner, being maintained in an intermediate coaxial position annular rings as a prolongation of the rims of the holes of the grip, on their inside faces, which are also introduced into said hole.<br>
The securing of the grip in this case is established by the actual pressure of the plates in the recesses (by manufacturing tolerances) and also by the sockets thereof. It is possible to improve the blocking action by foreseeing that the edges of the plates and the walls of the recipient recesses, are slightly oblique (wider in the bottom) in order to present an interlocking edge in the flexible material of the grip.<br>
In addition to the means of securing and the blocking elements, the plates may be joined to each other also by male-female elements passing through one or more supplementary holes provided in the handle of the spanner. Also in this embodiment, one of the blocking plates can be a male plate of elongated shape which incorporates at least one peg with diametric cuts which form flexible arms passing through an additional hole of the grip and through the additional hole in the handle of the spanner.  Such male plate can be combined with a<br><br>
8<br>
female plate which has on its inside face at least one projection provided with a recipient hole to receive the elastic arms of the male plate. The projection can be in the form of a bridge with legs joined to the plate.<br>
These plates once mounted on the respective face of<br>
the grip,  can be firmly integral to each other by<br>
supplementary means of axial support, with which the<br>
elastic arms o£ the male plate are extended. To achieve<br>
said extension, the supplementary means of axial support<br>
can comprise a solid pin housed in an axial void of- the<br>
peg, the pin extending the flexible arms. Such pegs are<br>
preferentially tubular with an axial void open to the<br>
outside of the plate from which they rise. Through this<br>
respective  hole  a  smooth  shaft  is  introduced under<br>
pressure, said shaft having been advantageously formed in<br>
the same process as for obtaining the male plate, by<br>
injection into a mould, standing on the other side of the<br>
plate and which on being struck slightly breaks the join<br>
along an annular line of easy detachment, being totally<br>
inserted thereinafter until its outer end is flush with<br>
the plate, thus contributing to the good appearance of<br>
the assembly since the hole is thereby closed. In turn<br>
the solid pin can emerge from the male plate or be an<br>
independent element. In this embodiment the free edge of<br>
the male and female plates can have a perimetric skirt<br>
which defines a lip which is introduced in a channel on<br>
the bottom of the longitudinal recess of the grip.<br>
As xs conventionally encountered m the type of grip, also the grip of the present invention can have on its edges and/or on its sides, ribs and/or protuberances<br>
serving a non-slip function.        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AH EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to the numbering scheme adopted for the figures 1 to 25, it can be seen how the replaceable grip 1 with a body la, covers the handle 2 3 of an adjustable spanner from its end up to an area close to the start of the head of the spanner, as may be observed in figure 1. The reference 2 in this figure designates the plate securing the grip to the handle, visible from this side and specifically that which has been designated as female plate. The edges of the grip 1 include a plurality of ribs 3 which optimise the grasp, there also being other spherical protuberances 4 on the larger faces, and other embellishing channels 5 and with which slipping of the spanner is also avoided.<br>
In figures 2 and 3 it can be seen how, through the presence of a plurality of parallel grooves 6, transversal ribs 3 are formed close to each other. On the longitudinal centre line of one of the faces of the grip<br>
1	there is a recess 7 in which is housed the female plate<br>
2	the geometry of which can be observed in figures 19 to 25.<br>
In figure 4 is shown the other face of the grip 1. In the longitudinal recess 8 the contour of which is advantageously identical to the recess 7 of the opposing face, shall be lodged the male securing plate 9 whose geometry can be observed in figures 12 to 18.<br>
The body of the grip 1 has an axial void lb with a cross section internally adapted to the cross section presented by the metal handle of the adjustable spanner, this being in the form of a double-tee as is deduced from examining figures 5 to 7.<br>
The male plate 9 has on its inside face the nipples or pegs 10 which traverse the web of the metal handle,<br><br>
-12-<br>
emerging on the other side to be inserted in the projections 11 provided on the inside face of the female plate 2 and which incorporate respective recipient holes 12 of diameter adapted to that of the pegs 10.<br>
The male 9 and female 2 plates fit perfectly into the respective housings defined by the recesses 8 and 1, not overshooting on the outside in order to contribute to the good appearance of the grip 1.<br>
The outside face of the male plate 9 includes the solid pins 13 which when inserted into the inside of the pegs 10 separate the flexible arms 14 radially in order to achieve perfect fastening to the female plate 2.<br>
The male 9 and female 2 securing plates each also include in the area in which is to be found the common hole for hanging which is a feature of that type of adjustable spanner, sockets 15 and 16, the free edges of which are machined in order to permit a dovetailed connection, when both securing plate 9 and 2 are mounted. The axial void 17 of these sockets 15 and 16 is open to the exterior in order to constitute the hole (see figure 1) from which the spanner is hung.<br>
In figures 8 and 9 can be see, referred to with number 18, the prismatic recess made in the bottom of the recess 7 of the grip 1 for receiving inside the projections 11 of the female plate 2. The male plate 9, as it has only the cylindrical nipples or pegs 10, it is only necessary for the floor of the recess 8 of the opposite face of the grip 1 to have the holes 19, as may be observed in figures 4 and 9.<br>
The grip 1 also has on its end corresponding to that of the handle, an internal thickening 27 (see figure 30) on each side, in which is made the pertinent hole 20 for insertion of the sockets 15 and 16 of the respective male 9 and female 2 plates. These thickenings have a contour which corresponds with that of the hole in the metal<br><br>
-13-<br>
handle of the spanner, being perfectly fitted in order to achieve greater immobility of the grip.<br>
On the other hand, as can be observed for example in figures 14, 15, 20 and 22, the sockets 15, 16 can be provided with respective thickenings 15a, 16a which engage in the hole for hanging 26 of the handle 23 of the spanner.<br>
Both the male plate 9 and the female plate 2 have in this example of embodiment shown in the figures and on their inside face, a perimeter skirt 21 very short in length, which is inserted in the channel 22 provided for this purpose in a position adjoining the wall of the recess 7 or 8 respectively.<br>
As has been stated previously and in this example of preferred embodiment, the female plate 2 has its prismatic projections 11 constituted in the form of a bridge in which has been implemented the respective entry hole 12a of the pegs 2 having flexible extendible arms 14. In the area occupied by these bridges, the perimeter skirt 21 is interrupted, as is clearly seen from figures 24 and 25.<br>
Making now special reference to figure 16, in which the male plate 9 is seen in cross section on the line marked in figure 14, it can be observed how the solid pin 13 forms part of the actual material that constitutes the plate 9 and is joined to the mouth of the axial hole of the tubular configuration of the peg 10, being joined solely by an annular line easily fractured on striking the pin 13 in order to introduce it into the peg 10 at the end of the assembly operation.<br>
With this disposition it can be understood that once the grip has been broken, it can be easily replaced once the original has been dismantled or destroyed, since the grip 1 can be easily introduced over the end of the metal handle of the adjustable spanner, afterwards proceeding<br><br>
-14-<br>
with great ease to insert the male and female securing plates and finally embedding the solid pins 13.<br>
The mechanical union between the plates 9 and 2, through the pegs 10 which are introduced into the holes 12 and the subseguent locking action, by the pins 13 which are introduced through the inside of the pegs 10, permits a union much superior to the traditional adhesive ones, whereby the grip can be replaced with ease.<br>
On the other hand the male and female plates 9 and 2, define inscribable surfaces, for references, names, etc. with a greater degree of clarity, such that they permit an adequate personalisation of the product.<br>
Now, making reference to figures 26 to 32, an adjustable spanner can be seen according to another embodiment, in which the grip 1' also extends in like fashion over the length of the handle 23 and comprises a body la and an axial void lb in the form of a double-tee. The grip 1' is consequently very similar to the grip 1 and is fabricated in a material which offers a high coefficient of friction, with an ergonomic shape very agreeable to hold.<br>
As can be seen more clearly in figure 27, the larger faces of the grip 1' have the longitudinal recesses with identical geometrical configuration and include the hole for hanging 20, the respective blocking plates 24 being fitted tightly in them, said plates being fabricated preferentially with stiff plastic and which in this case are identical, finishing advantageously flush with the exposed face of the grip 1' . One of the ends of the blocking plates 24 has the hollow cylindrical projection, or socket 25 intended to be inserted tightly into the respective opening 20 of the grip 1' (see figures 30 and 32) coaxial with that for hanging the spanner, provided in the metal handle and referred to with number 2 6 (see figure 32).<br><br>

The free ends of these sockets 25 do not actually come into contact in order to not produce the disagreeable effects mentioned previously, that is, they do not provoke rubbing and possible frictional noises, though they do manage to penetrate the metallic web of the handle 23 in order to optimise the blocking of the grip 1 .<br>
In figures 30 to 32, the internal cross section of the grip 1' can be seen, adapted to that of the handle 2 3 which in this particular case is also tee-shaped, and also how the annular thickenings 27 or internal collars of the grip 1 , analogous to those present on the other grip 1, progress towards the inside of the hole 26.<br>
The plates 24 of stiff plastic are mounted after having impregnated with glue or adhesive, the walls and floor of the respective longitudinal recess, referred to with number 28.<br>
In the example of embodiment shown in figures 2 6 to 32, the plates 24 and noticeably elongated, very similar to those with references 2 and 9 in the first form of embodiment, occupying in both cases a large part of the length of the respective grip 1 and 1 , given that in addition to covering the area of the hole 20 for hanging the spanner 1, 1, they are extended towards the head in a longitudinal direction following the centre line. It is appreciated that such plates can be shorter in length, and even be limited to the external skirt 24' (see figures 32 and 33) of the socket 25 or possibly, as may be appreciated in figures 34 and 35, a washer 24'', see figures 34 and 35.<br>
The plates 24 as well as serving to stiffen by<br>
offering a great resistance to twisting of the grip 1' ,<br>
also provide like plates 2 and 9, for the incorporation<br>
of  spanner  information  by  having  inscribed  thereon<br>
 references,  names,  etc.,  with  a  higher  degree  of<br><br>
-16-<br>
definition than is customary, permitting an adequate personalisation of the product. In the event that the plates be limited solely to the area surrounding the hole 20 for hanging, that is when dealing with the above mentioned washers 24'', the data and references of the spanner can be located, either on the grip 1 itself or on other independent plates 24', as may be seen in figure 34.<br>
In any of the foregoing solutions provision has been made for the grip 1 or 1 to include recesses 7, 8, 28 on both side faces in order to effect the fitting of the pertinent stiffening plates 2, 9, 24, washers 24' ' ' and/or personalisation plates 24', however the grip can equally have recesses on one face only, though in these cases the length of the socket 25 of the plate 24 shall have to be somewhat greater than in the previous cases in order to optimise the blocking of the grip, or come with the washer 24' ' ' .<br>
The grip 1 is structured in such a manner that there is no contact between rigid elements. It can be seen in the figures that there is no contact between the sockets 25 of the plates 24 in stiff plastic. Nor is there contact between the plates 24 and the metal handle 23 by being separated by the grip itself of thermoplastic material, rubber or similar.<br>
The grip 1 can be applied to any kind of adjustable spanner independently of the shape of the handle, the blind axial void having a cross section adapted to that which the handle has, at all points thereof. This grip can even be mounted on spanners already existing and being employed by the user.<br>
in the event that it be necessary to replace one grip with another, the procedure is to extract or separate the plastic plates 24 from the grip 1' to be replaced,  or else proceed with a 'peeling" operation<br><br>
-17-<br>
which consists in making a lateral or longitudinal cut from top to bottom of the grip, which permits it to be opened to release the ends of the sockets 25 of said plates 24, with respect to the hole 26 of the handle 23.<br>
Preferentially the union between the plates 24 and the grip 1 shall be implemented by means of glue or adhesive, however other systems may be foreseen like fitting together by dovetail sections, etc.<br><br>
