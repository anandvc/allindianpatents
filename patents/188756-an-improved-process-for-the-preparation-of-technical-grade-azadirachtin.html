				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of technical grade azadirachtin<br>
More particularly it provides an improved process for the preparation of technical azadirachtin as dry amorphous powder completely free from oil by low temperature centrifuge which is useful for formulation as insecticide.<br>
Several extraction methods have been adapted by the scientists in India and aboard to obtain azadirachtin in pure form and crude powder form. The following are the few important methods reported in the literature. 1. Nakanishi (1987) J. Nat. Products, 50 : 241-244 wherein 2 kg seed kernels were defatted in hexane (oil 1050 ml was discarded), defatted marc was extracted in 95% ethanol. 185 g ethanol extract was partitioned with petroleum ether (oil 47 g discarded) and 95% methanol water. 138 g polar extracts was partitioned with water and ethyl acetate (water soluble proteins, subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography. 13 g azadirachtin enriched fraction was crystallised from carbon tetrachloride. 8.5 g crude azadirachtin was subjected to flash chromatography to obtain 5 g 98% pure azadirachtin. The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	The process involves six steps, making it very tedious and time consuming<br>
2.	The procedure requires the use of five solvents. Some of the solvents are costly which enhances the total cost of the product.<br>
3.	Percentage of azadirachtin in crude powder is not reported.<br><br>
2.	Zanno et al. (.1975), J. Am. Chem. Sop. 97 : (1975-1977) wherein Defatted<br>
marc was extracted with 95% ethanol, the extract was partitioned first with ethyl<br>
acetate/water and then methanol/water. Resultant polar mixture was twice<br>
chromatographed over silica gel eluting first with ether-acetone mixture followed<br>
by chloroform-ethyl acetate mixture. Crystallisation of crude powder and<br>
percentage of azadirachtinjn crude is not reported. Preparative TLC was done<br>
to obtain pure azadirachtin (98%).<br>
The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	The procedure involves use'of seven solvents which makes the procedure expensive.<br>
2.	The process involves eight steps making it very tedious.<br>
3.	The process include the use of silica gel chromatography making the process tedious.<br>
3.	Butterworth and Morgan (1968), J.Chem. Soc. chem Comm.: 23-24<br>
Whereini kg seeds were defatted with hexane, extracted with 95% ethanol and<br>
the extract was then partitioned between ethyl acetate and methanol: benzene.<br>
Residue obtain on the removal of ethyl acetate was partitioned between<br>
petroleum ether and 90% methanol. Petroleum layer was discarded and residue<br>
obtain on removal of methanol was subjected to silica gel chromatography<br>
followed by preparative TLC to obtain pure azadirachtin (98%). Crystallisation of<br>
crude powder and concentration of azadirachtin is not reported.<br>
The drawbacks are:<br><br>
1.	Two   time   partitioning   was*   done   followed    by    silica    gel chromatography makes the procedure tedious.<br>
2.	The process involves the use of five solvent which makes method costly.<br>
3.	The process involves seven steps, makes the process lengthy.<br>
4. Siddiqui et al. (1992), J. Nat. Products 55 : 303-310 wherein Fresh<br>
unruptured, ripe fruits of neem (10 kg) were repeatedly percolated with ethanol<br>
at room temperature. Removal of solvent from combined extract under reduced<br>
pressure gave a dark green residue, which was partitioned between ethyl<br>
acetate and water. The ethyl acetate layer was repeatedly extracted with 1%<br>
sodium hydroxide to separate the acidic impurities from the neutral constituents.<br>
The residue obtained, on removal of solvent: from ethyl acetate layer was<br>
partitioned between 50% ethanol and petroleum ether (1:1). The upper layer was<br>
treated with charcoal and freed of solvent in vacuum. The residue thus obtained<br>
was divided into petroleum ether soluble and petroleum ether insoluble fraction.<br>
Petroleum ether insoluble fraction was subjected to preparative TLC to obtain<br>
azadirachtin along with naheedin. Crystallisation of crude mass was not<br>
attempted.<br>
The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	Six solvents have been used in the process making it costly.<br>
2.	The process involves eight steps which makes it lengthy and tedious.<br><br>
3.	Use of charcoal makes it cumbersome.<br>
4.	Crystallization of crude was not attempted.<br>
5. Rengasamy et al. (1993), World Neem Conference, India, 1993 wherein Kernel powder (200 g) was soxhlet-extracted successively with hexane and ethanol by a modified method of Schroeder and Nakanishi (1987). Hexane extract on concentration yielded an oil. The ethanol layer on concentration yield a semi solid. It was dissolved in ethanol and analysed for azadirachtin content byHPLC.<br>
The ethanol concentrate was dissolved in ethanol and partitioned with hexane (6x50ml) to remove traces of oil. The ethanol fraction was suspended in water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction was dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated. The concentrated mass was subjected to silica gel chromatography using 150 ml ethyl acetate for elution. The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	The process involves the use of four solvents making the method<br>
costly.<br>
2.	There are five steps in the method which makes it lengthy tedious.<br>
3.	Crystallization of crude was not attempted.<br>

Technical azadirachtin (10-25%) contains azadirachtin along with other meliacin compounds such as nimbin,; salanin, nimbolide, nimbinene, deacetylsalianin, deacetylnimbine, epinimbine, deacetylnimbin. More than 50 neem base pesticide formulations containing azadirachtin have been developed in India and aboard (parmar and Ketkar, 1996) but only the following formulations have been registered under the Insecticides Act (1968) for the control of insects, pests of arhar, gram, cotton, brinjal, cabbage, jute, potato, tobacco etc. Besides, a number of entrepreneurs are coming up for registration of their neem based products for the control of pests.<br>

There is a considerable emphasis on the development of neem pesticides base on "azadirachtin" which is the most widely evaluated neem compound. However, it may* not be advisable to develop a product based on pure azadirachtin alone because of the following reasons :<br>
1.	There is hardly any evidence of the antagonistic effect of one neem compound on the other. Literature survey reveals that under many situations, crude or semi-purified extracts of seeds give similar results as compared to pure azadirachtin and in fact, sometime, crude extracts perform better than azadirachtin alone base preparations.<br>
2.	There is always a danger of development of resistance in insects against a product containing a single active molecule.<br>
3.	Greater technical skills are required to produce very high concentrations of azadirachtin in technical grade material which also leads to marked escalation in cost.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of technical dry amorphous powder containing 27-40% azadirachtin. which obviates the drawback as detailed above. Another object of the present invention is to, reduce the multiple steps.Still another object of the present invention is not to use water which affects the concentration at the end product.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare dry powder which is completely free from oil by use of centrifuge at low temp.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to eliminate the use of column.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare powder without<br>
obtaining the sticky mass by use of molecular sieves and continuous stirring.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of<br>
technical grade azadirachtin , characterized in four step process of preparation 0.21-0.42<br>
% oil-free powder of neem containing 27-40% azadiractin from non aqueous extract of<br>
seed kernel of Azadiracta indica (neem) , the said process comprising the step of:    (i)<br>
obtaining   filtrate of said Azadiracta seed kernel powder by mechanical stirring in polar<br>

Details of the process<br><br>
500- gm seeds kernels were ground to fine powder and taken in a container fitted with mechanical stirrer, ethanol or methanol (approx. 1 L. or more was required for the first extraction). Whole mass was stirred for 8-10 hrs. The mass was allowed to settle down and filtered using buchner funnel. The extraction was repeated two more times. The combine filtrate was cone, in rotary evaporator to about 600 ml and non-polar solvent hexane was added and kept in fridge for some time and centrifuge at low temperature ranging between 4oC-5oC filtrate and concentrated in rotary evaporator ethyl acetate was added (approx. 1L or more) and thick dark mass was discarded and ethyl acetate portion was filtered to get a clear solution it was concentrated and molecular sieves mesh size ranging from 4A&gt;or 5Ao was incorporated in the solution and cooling was done at temperature 0oC - 10oC by keeping it in fridge and precipitated by 60-80 petroleum ether or hexane by continuous stirring to get dry amorphous powder completely free from oil.<br>
If the seed kernels are of pure quality than by this methodology crude powder obtain would contain 27 - 40 % azadirachtin. It is therefore advisable to procure the best quality of neem seeds in order to obtain good percentage of azadirachtin in dry powder.<br>
