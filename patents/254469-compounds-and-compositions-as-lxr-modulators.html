COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS AS LXR MODULATORS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of priority to U,S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application numbers 60/543,848, filed 11 February 2004 and 60/623,021, filed 27 October 2004, The full disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The invention provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
such compounds and methods of using such compounds to treat or prevent diseases or disorders associated with the activity of liver X receptors (Lars). Background<br>
[0003]	Liver X receptors (Lars), Lore and LXR(3, are nuclear receptors that<br>
regulate the metabolism of several important lipids, including cholesterol and bile acids.<br>
While Lerp is expressed ubiquitously in the body, Lora is expressed in the liver and to<br>
a smaller degree in the kidneys, small intestine, adipose tissue, spleen and adrenal glands.<br>
[0004]	Lars bind to the ATP binding cassette transporter-1 (Aback) promoter<br>
and increase expression of the gene to produce Aback protein. Aback is a membrane bound transport protein that is involved in the regulation of cholesterol efflux from extra-hepatic cells onto nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Mutations in the Baal gene result in low levels of HDL and an accompanying increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction and alchemic stroke. Lora and  agonists have been shown to increase Aback gene expression thereby increasing HDL cholesterol and, as a consequence, decreasing both the net absorption of cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease.   LXR agonists also<br><br>
up regulate macrophage expression of polio protein E (ape) and Bagel, both of<br>
which contribute to the efflux of cellular cholesterol By stimulating macrophage<br>
cholesterol efflux through up regulation of Aback, Bagel and/or ape expression, as<br>
well as increasing the expression of other target genes including cholesterol ester transfer<br>
protein and lipoprotein lipase, LXR agonists influence plasma lipoproteins.<br>
[0005]	The novel compounds of this invention modulate the activity of Lars and<br>
are, therefore, expected to be useful in the treatment of LXR-associated diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, inflammation and disorders of glucose metabolism such as insulin resistance and obesity.<br><br>

[0019]	"Oily" means a monocyclic or fused bicycled aromatic ring assembly<br>
containing six to ten ring carbon atoms. For example, aryl can be phenyl or apathy, preferably phenyl. "Arlene" means a divalent radical derived from an aryl group. "Heteroaryl" is as defined for aryl where one or more of the ring members are a heteroatoms. For example heteroaryl includes purity, kindly, indazolyl, quinoxalinyl, quinolinyl,     banjo rankle,    benzopyranyl,    benzothiopyianyl,     banjo[l ,3]diazoles.<br><br>
imidazolyl, banjo-imidazolyl, pyrimidinyl, foamy, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyrazolyl, thinly, etc. C1-6aryl alkyl" means an aryl as described above connected via a alkaline groom ping. For example, C1-6 alkyl includes phenethyl,<br>
benzyl, etc.<br>
[0020]	"Cyclically" means a saturated or partially unsaturated, monocyclic, fused<br>
bicyclical or bridged polycyclic ring assembly containing the number of ring atoms<br>
indicated. For example, C1-6cycloalkyl includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,<br>
cyclohexyl, etc, "Heterocycloalkyl" means cyclically, as defined in this application,<br>
provided that one or more of the ring carbons indicated, are replaced by a moiety selected<br>
from -0-, -N=, -NR", -C(0) -, -S-, -S(0) - or -S(0)2-, wherein R is hydrogen,C1-6alkyl<br>
or a nitrogen protecting group. For example, C1-6heterocycloalkyl as used in this<br>

Modulation of LXR receptor can be up-regulation (i.e., agonizing, activation or stimulation) or down-regulation (i.e. antagonizing, inhibition or suppression). The mode of action of an LXR modulator can be direct, e.g., through binding to the LXR receptor as a legend. The modulation can also be indirect, e.g., through binding to and/or modifying another molecule which otherwise binds to and activates the LXR receptor, or by stimulating the generation of an endogenous LXR legend. Thus, modulation of LXR includes a change in the bioactivities of an LXR agonist legend (i.e., its activity in binding to and/or activating an LXR receptor) or a change in the cellular level of the legend.<br>

[0034]	Preferred compounds of Formula I are detailed in the Examples and Table<br>

Pharmacology and Utility<br>
[0035]	Compounds of the invention modulate the activity of Lars and, as such,<br>
are useful for treating diseases or disorders in which Lars contribute to the pathology and/or symptomatology of the disease. This invention further provides compounds of this invention for use in the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of diseases or disorders in which Lars contribute to the pathology and/or symptomatology of the disease. LXR mediated diseases or conditions include inflammation, cardiovascular disease including arteriosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesteremia, hyperlipidemia and disorders of glucose homeostasis, including insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and obesity.<br>
[0036]	Lipoprotein metabolism is a dynamic process comprised of the production<br>
of triglyceride and cholesterol rich particles from the liver as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), modification of these lipoprotein particles within the plasma (VLDL to intermediate density (DDL) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL)) and clearance of the particles from the plasma, again by the liver. This process provides the transport of triglycerides and free cholesterol to cells of the body. Reverse cholesterol transport is the<br><br>
proposed mechanism by which excess cholesterol is returned to the liver from extra-hepatic tissue.<br>
[0037]	The process is carried out by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.<br>
The combination of lipoprotein production (VLDL, HDL) from the liver, modification of particles (all) within the plasma and subsequent clearance back to the liver, accounts for the steady state cholesterol concentration in plasma. Compounds of this invention increase reverse cholesterol transport by increasing coolest l efflux from the arteries. This invention includes the use of compounds of this invention for the preparation of a medicament for increasing reverse cholesterol transport. Additionally, this invention provides compounds for inhibit cholesterol absorption and the use of compounds of this invention for the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting net cholesterol absorption.<br>
[0038]	The compounds of this invention can also be useful for the prevention or<br>
treatment of inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases or neurological disorders. Accordingly, this invention also provides a method for preventing or treating inflammation and a method for preventing or treating neurodegenerative diseases or neurological disorders, particularly neurodegenerative diseases or disorders characterized by neuron degeneration, neuron injury or impaired plasticity or inflammation in the CNS. Particular diseases or conditions that are characterized by neuron degeneration, inflammation, cholesterol and lipid abnormalities in the brain and thus benefiting from the growth and/or repair of neurons include stroke, Amities s disease, front-temporal dementias (naturopathies), peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewd bodies, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis and Neumann-Pick disease. Diseases or conditions that are characterized by neuron degeneration and/or impaired plasticity include psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Particular diseases or conditions that are characterized by neuronal injury include those conditions associated with brain and/or spinal cord injury, clouding trauma. In addition, the compounds of this invention can be used to treat or prevent various diseases with an inflammatory component, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, asthma, etc.<br><br>
[0039]	LXR agonists improve glucose tolerance and enhance glut4 expression<br>
(U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/436,112, filed 12/23/2002; U. S. Patent Application 10/745,334, filed 12/22/2003). There is a coordinated regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. In the liver, LXR agonists inhibit expression of several genes that are important for hepatic gluconeogenesis, e.g., PGC-la, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose-6-phosphatase expression. Inhibition of these gluconeogenic genes is accompanied by an induction in expression of glycosidase, which promotes hepatic glucose utilization. It was also found that  mRNA levels were unregulated by LXR agonists in adipose tissue, and that glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adiposities was enhanced in vitro.<br>
[0040]	In accordance with these discoveries, the present invention provides<br>
methods for enhancing glut4 expression in cells in a subject by administering a compound of the invention to the subject. The present’ invention also provides methods for treating diabetes mellitus and related disorders, such as obesity or hyperglycemia, by administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound of the invention to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. For example, type 11 diabetes is amenable to treatment with methods of the present invention. By enhancing sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake by cells, administration with a compound of the invention can also treat other diseases characterized by insulin dysfunction (e.g., resistance, inactivity or deficiency) and/or insufficient glucose transport into cells.<br>
[0041]	Compounds of the present invention also regulate expression levels of a<br>
number of genes that play important roles in liver gluconeogenesis.   Accordingly, the<br>
present invention further provides methods for reducing gluconeogenesis in a subject by<br>
modulating expression of such genes (e.g., PGC-1 and PEPCK).<br>
[0042]	In the pancreas, LXR activation stimulates insulin secretion via modulation<br>
of glucose and lipid metabolism in pancreatic /3-cells, suggesting another mechanism for LXR's anti-diabetic effects. LXR modulators can thus also regulate glucose tolerance by enhancing insulin secretion from the pancreas.<br>
[0043]	In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention further provides a<br>
method for preventing or treating any of the diseases or disorders described above in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject a<br><br>
therapeutically effective amount (See, "Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions", infra) of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For any of the above uses, file required dosage will vary depending on tie mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.<br>
Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0044]	In   general,   compounds   of the   invention  will  be   administered  in<br>
therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents. A therapeutically effective amount can vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.03 to 2.5mg/kg per body weight An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0,5mg to about loom, conveniently administered, e.g. in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 1 to 50mg active ingredient<br>
[0045]	Compounds of the invention can be administered as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions by any conventional route, in particular enter ally, e.g., orally, e.g., in the form of tablets or capsules, or parent rally, e.g., in the form of impeccable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g., in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or suppository form or in inhaled forms. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention in free form or in a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluents can be manufactured in a conventional manner by mixing, granulating or coating methods. For example, oral compositions can be tablets or gelatin capsules comprising the active gradient together with a) diluents, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, manifold, orbital, cellulose and/or glycogen; b) lubricants, e.g., silica, talcum, stair acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethylene glycol; for tablets also c) binders, e.g., magnesium aluminum    silicate,    starch   paste,    gelatin,   tragacanth,   methyl cellulose,   sodium<br><br>
caiboxymethylcellulose and or polyvinylpyroUidone; if desired d) disintegrants, e.g.,<br>
starches, agar, agonic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures; and/or e)<br>
absorbents, colorants, flavors and sweeteners. Inject able compositions can be aqueous<br>
isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories can be prepared from fatty emulsions<br>
or suspensions. The compositions can be sterilized and/or contain adjuvant, such as<br>
preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for<br>
regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they can also contain other<br>
therapeutically valuable substances. Suitable formulations for transferal applications<br>
include an effective amount of a compound of the present invention with a carrier. A<br>
carrier can include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage<br>
through the skin of the host. For example, transferal devices are in the form of a<br>
bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally<br>
with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of<br>
the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and<br>
means to secure the device to the skin. Matrix transferal formulations can also be<br>
used. Suitable formulations for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, are<br>
preferably aqueous solutions, ointments, creams or gels well-known in the art. Such can<br>
contain solubilizers, stabilizers, and tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.<br>
[0046]	Compounds of the invention can be administered in therapeutically<br>
effective amounts in combination wifely one or more therapeutic agents (pharmaceutical combinations). For example, synergistic effects can occur with other substances used in the treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory and/or neurodegenerative diseases. Examples of such compounds include fib rates, Tads, motorman, etc. Where the compounds of the invention are administered in conjunction with other therapies, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-dig employed, on the specific drug employed, on the condition being treated and so forth,<br>
[0047]	The mention also provides for pharmaceutical combinations, e.g. a kit,<br>
comprising a) a first agent which is a compound of the invention as disclosed herein, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, and b) at least one co-agent. The kit can clued instructions for its administration.<br><br>
[004S]	The terms "co-administration" or "combined administration" or the like as<br>
utilized herein are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents<br>
to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are<br>
not necessarily administered by the same route of administration or at the same time.<br>
[0049]	The term "pharmaceutical combination" as used herein means a product<br>
that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term "fixed combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula I and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term "non-fixed combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula I and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits, wherein such administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the 2 compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of 3 or more active ingredients.<br>
Processes for Making Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0050]	The present invention also includes processes for the preparation of<br>
compounds of the invention. In the reactions described, it can be necessary to protect reactive fictional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, amino, trio or carboy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used in accordance with standard practice, for example, see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. West in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br>
[0051]	Pompoms of Formula I can be prepared by proceeding as in the following<br>
Reaction Scheme I:<br>
Reactions Scheme I<br><br><br>
in which n, Y, Z, Rim, R2 and R3 are as defined in the Summary of the Invention.

Additional Processes for Making Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0052]	A compound of the invention can be prepared as a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the fine base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the mentions can be prepared by reacting tiiie free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br><br>
[0053]	The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be<br>
prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to tie nonexpanding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.).<br>
[0054]	Compounds of the innovation in uncivilized form can be prepared from N-<br>
oxides of compounds of the invention by tram with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, trephines hospice, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus dichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxins, or the like) at 0 to 80°C.<br>
[0055]	Prod rug derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by<br>
methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saltier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985), For example, appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-derivatives compound of the invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
[0056]	Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by<br>
means known to those of ordinary skill in the art A detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T. W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3"* edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.<br>
[0057]	Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or<br>
formed during the process of the invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates). Hydrates of compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
[0058]	Compounds   of the  invention  can  be  prepared  as  their  individual<br>
stereoisomers by reacting a raceme mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds,  separating the<br><br>
diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of<br>
enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the<br>
compounds of the invention, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline<br>
diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting<br>
points, boiling points, solubility, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking<br>
advantage   of these   dissimilarities.	The   diastereomers   can   be   separated  by<br>
chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in recombination. Resolution of file raceme mixture may be carried out using choral HPLC. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of pompoms from their racemes mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Culet, Samuel H. Wiley, "Enantiomers, Race mates and Resolutions", John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>

Assay 1 - Transcriptional Assay<br>
[00119]	Transfixion assays are used to assess the ability of compounds of the<br>
invention to modulate the transcriptional activity of the Lures. Briefly, expression vectors for chimerical proteins containing the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 fused to the legend-binding domain (LBD) of either Lore or Lerp are introduced via transient transecting motor mammalian cells, together with a reporter plastids where the Lucifer’s gene is under the control of a GAL4 binding site. Upon exposure to an LXR modulator, LXR transcriptional activity varies, and this can be monitored by changes in Lucifer’s levels. If transected cells are exposed to an LXR agonist, LXR-dependent transcriptional activity increases and Lucifer’s levels rise.<br>

Assay 3 - FRET Co-Activator Recruitment Assay<br>
[00125]	A FRET assay is used to assess the ability of a compound of the invention<br>
to bind directly to the LXR legend-binding domain (LBD) and promote the recruitment of proteins that potentate the transcriptional activity of Lars (e.g. co-activators). This cell-free assay uses a recombinant fusion protein composed of the LXR LBD and a tag (e.g. GST, His, FLAG) that simplifies its purification, and a synthetic biotinylated peptide derived from the nuclear receptor interacting domain of a transcriptional co-activator protein, such as steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1). In one format, the tagged LBD fusion protein can be labeled using an antibody against the LBD tag coupled to europium (e.g. EU-labeled anti-<br><br>
GST antibody), and the co-activator peptide can be labeled with allophycocyanin (APC) coupled to streptavidin. In the presence of an agonist for LXR, the co-activator peptide is recruited to the LXR LBD, bringing the EU and APC moieties in close proximity. Upon excitation of the complex with light at 340nM, EU absorbs and transfers energy to the APC moiety resulting in emission at 665 nm. If there is no energy transfer (indicating lack of EU-APC profundity), EU emits at 615nm. Thus tutee ratio of the 665 to 615mn light emitted gives an indication of the strength of co-activator peptide recruitment, and thus of agonist binding totheLXRLBD.<br>
