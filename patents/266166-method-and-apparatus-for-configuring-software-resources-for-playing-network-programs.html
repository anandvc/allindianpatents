METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONFIGURING SOFTWARE RESOURCES<br>
FOR PLAYING NETWORK PROGRAMS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field of playing network programs, in particular to a method and apparatus for configuring software resources for playing network programs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The programs that could be viewed by the users are not limited to the programs stored on the optical disc due to emergence of network optical disc formats (for example, enhanced eDVD optical disc format, Blue-ray disc BD format etc.), they extend to the network programs related to the contents on optical discs. Downloading programs from networks and playing these programs have become a very popular entertainment way. When distributing network optical discs, an optical disc content provider provides in a network server the network programs corresponding to the contents on the distributed optical discs for downloading by optical disc user. In genera], these network programs are played synchronously with the video and audio contents on the local optical discs to enhance playing effect. Asa part of the contents of network program, some enhanced information like web page, animation, program introduction or staff introduction, etc. are downloaded to the user terminal along with the network programs. These enhanced information often includes some novel fonts or glyphs, original graphics or motion vector graphics with animation effect, etc.. In addition, the network programs stored in the network are often updated, so are the fonts and graphics required for playing the programs.<br>
The software resources supporting these new contents, such as the font library supporting the fonts that need to be displayed, graphic library supporting graphic display or other auxiliary programs for enhancing playing, are usually downloaded along with network programs. Taking a font as an example, because different fonts of a character have different dot matrix structures and profiles, corresponding font data (i.e. dot matrix structure data and profile data, etc.) are required for displaying a character according to a particular font, otherwise it is impossible to output and display this character. Likewise, the<br><br>
playing effect will be affected if a graphic, especially a new graphic, has no corresponding graphic library locally.<br>
Usually, the software resources downloaded together with the network programs are quite large, for example, a font library file ranges from 3MB to 20MB. Thus, the time required for downloading is longer, especially in the case of network bandwidth shortage or network congestion, the playing of network programs may have to be interrupted and the playing quality cannot be guaranteed, as a result the users lost interest of viewing the programs.<br>
One of the methods for solving the problem of downloading software resource is to download in advance the software resources that may be used to the user terminal playing apparatus. On one hand, this method can satisfy the requirements in most cases, but the limited storage space of the user terminal playing apparatus will be occupied. On the other hand, because network programs and enhanced information are often updated, the software resources that are downloaded in advance cannot cover all the required fonts, graphics, programs, etc., in particular the newly arising fonts, graphics, programs, etc. Another method for solving the problem of downloading software resource is to determine the locally absent resources through an optical disc playing apparatus after downloading the network programs, then transmit a request for downloading the absent software resources to the network server. If, during playing the network programs, the playing apparatus finds that the font data of a certain character is absent, then requests for downloading from the network server and allocates certain network bandwidth to download the required font data, the process of playing programs will be inevitably affected. Such method cannot guarantee the playing quality and the process of playing programs is loaded with trivial details.<br>
Therefore, it needs to provide a method and apparatus for configuring software resources for playing network programs so as to realize rapidly the configuration of software resources and avoid the delay or interrupt of playing network program due to fonts and graphics being not supported or not supported timely.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The concept of the invention is: a request for downloading network programs transmitted from a network program playing apparatus to a network server includes the configuration information of software resources at a user terminal. The network server compares the information of the software resources required for playing network programs with the configuration information of the software resources at the user terminal, and transmits to the user terminal the software resources that are required for playing programs but are absent at the user terminal. The user terminal can combine the received software resources with the local software resources to play the downloaded network programs. The software resources may be a font library, a graphic library, motion vector graphics, or a software resource required by an application to play network programs. Below, the invention is described by taking the configuration of the font for playing a network program as an<br><br>
example, the configuration methods of other software resources are the same as those of font resources.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the network program playing system according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the network program playing means 110 is a network optical disc playing apparatus (the following text makes description by taking a network optical disc playing apparatus as an example), and it can be other playing apparatus capable of playing network programs, like PC, etc.. According to the requirement for playing the contents of the programs stored on the optical disc or from the user, means 110 links network server 130 via network 120 and requests for downloading specified network programs.<br>
The downloading request issued from means 110 comprises a configuration information related to the font data in means 110, for example, the description of a database of dot matrix of Chinese characters font included in means 110. The configuration information may include the name of font, the total number of the characters having such type of font, a FontMask indicating whether the dot matrixes or profile data of the characters having such type of font exist, etc.. Means 110 can obtain the configuration information of the transmitted font data according to the description information of the local font data file. After receiving the downloading request transmitted by means 110 and the configuration information of font data of playing means 110 therein, network server 130 compares the information of the font data required for playing network programs with the configuration information of the received font data, determines and transmits the font data that are absent in the user terminal playing means 110 but are required for playing programs. Playing means 110 receives font data transmitted from the network server 130 and combines the local original font library, then said network program can be played smoothly. Said font data comprises specific font names, the total amount of the characters having such type of font, a single or more dot matrixes or profile data of the characters having such type of font, etc..<br>
The network program playing system provided by the invention simplifies the processes of downloading and playing network programs. It does not need to download the whole font library corresponding to network program, instead it only needs the local user terminal to transmit once information, then the required program is obtained and the corresponding configuration of font data is realized.<br><br>
Fig. 2 is a flow chart of a method for configuring software resources in a playing apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention. First, the network program plaving apparatus receives an instruction of downloading network programs from user or network optica] disc during program playing (step S205).<br>
Then, the configuration information for local font data is acquired (step S210). The<br>
configuration information of font data at the local user terminal is information describing<br>
the font data at local user terminal. A general program playing apparatus can<br>
correspondingly obtain a description information (called as a fontmask in this example)<br>
according to the local font data, for example, it may be represented as:<br>
FontMask	= #(singleFontMask)<br>
SingleFontMask   = (FontFaceName/QiaracterGlyphAvailablcBitMask) FontFaceName    = Face Name of a specific font CharacterGlyphAvailableBitMask= A Hex decimal value that indicates<br>
which character glyph exists and which doesn't exist in local system From the information, the network server can analyze the configuration information of the font at the local user terminal, for example, the font name, the version level of font data, the total number of the characters having such type of font, the fontmask indicating whether the dot matrixes of the characters having such type of font exist, etc.. Next, a request for downloading network programs is transmitted to the network server according to the downloading instruction. This request includes the configuration information of local font data (step S220).<br>
After processing the downloading request and font information, the network server transmits to the user terminal the network program and the font data that are required for playing said program but are absent at the local user terminal. The font required for playing network program may be a part of font library. For example, Chinese simplified font library has the fonts of thousands of characters, but the playing process only uses 200 fonts therein, while 180 font data (font dot matrix or profile data) among 200 fonts can be found in the local font library that-the user terminal has, whereas the other 20 font data (font dot matrix or profile data) need to be downloaded form the network. The network server encapsulates the network program and the font data that need to be transmitted and transmits them to the user terminal. The user terminal receives the network programs and font data transmitted from the network server (step S230), then combines the<br><br>
received font data with the local font librarv file to plav said network proeram (steo S240) Said font data include a specific font name, the total amount of the characters having such type of font, a single or more dot matrixes or profile data of the characters having such type of font, etc..<br>
The font data "downloaded to the user terminal will be combined with the local original font library at the user terminal. If the downloaded font data do not belong to the same type of font data file as all the local font data, i.e. they cannot be classified as one of local font data, then it needs to establish separately a font file for the downloaded font data. The font library file at the user terminal will be supplemented and expanded along with the downloading of different network programs.<br>
According to the above method, the user terminal only needs to attachedly transmit the description information of the font data at the local user terminal when transmitting a request for downloading, then the purpose of configuring and playing corresponding font will be achieved. The font parsing and displaying engine of the playing apparatus at the user terminal do not have any change and the playing effect is not affected. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an apparatus 300 for configuring software resources in a playing apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention. Apparatus 300 may comprise an acquiring means 310 for acquiring the configuration information of the local font data. The acquired information of the font data may include: the name of font, the total number of the characters having such type of font, a fontmask indicating whether the dot matrix or profile data corresponding to each character having such type of font exists, etc. Apparatus 300 further comprises a downloading instruction receiving means 320 for receiving an instruction of downloading network programs from the user or an instruction of downloading network programs required for playing the program on network optical disc.<br>
Apparatus 300 further comprises a transmitting means 330 for transmitting a request for downloading network program to the network server, this request includes the configuration information of the font data at the local user terminal. Usually, the description information of the local font data can be obtained from the description information of font data file, including the name of font, the total number of the characters having such type of font and a fontmask indicating whether the dot matrix or profile data corresponding to each character having such type of font exists, etc.<br><br>
Apparatus 300 further includes a receiving means 340 for receiving font data and network programs downloaded from the network server-Apparatus 300 further includes a combining means 350 for combining the received font data with the local font data file to play said program. The manner of combining the received data with the local font data comprises adding the received font data to the local font library file or creating a separate font library file, etc.<br>
With apparatus 300, the network program playing apparatus can efficiently and rapidly configure and play the font that are required for playing network program but are absent at the local user terminal.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow chart of a method for configuring software resources in a network server according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fie. 4, first, the network server receives a request for downloading network program transmitted from the user terminal, said request including the configuration information of software resource at said user terminal (step S410).<br>
Then, according to the received downloading request, the network server obtains the information of font data required for playing network programs requested for dounloading (step S420). Usually, the information of the font data required for playing network programs can be obtained from the description information of network programs. Then, a comparison is made between the information of the font data required for playing network programs and the information of the font data at the user terminal to determine the information to be transmitted to the user terminal (step 430). The information to be transmitted to the user terminal is generally the font data that are required for playing network programs but are absent at the user terminal.<br>
The contents of the network program requested to be played and the font data that are needed by said program but are absent at the user terminal are encapsulated to form feedback data packets that are transmitted to the user terminal. The feedback data packets also include the configuration information of necessary font (for example, name of font, index, the total number of the dot matrix of profile data of the included characters having such type of font or, etc.)<br>
Finally, the network server transmits to the user terminal the font data that are required for transmission (step S440). The transmitted font data can be encapsulated into a feedback data packet together with a network program and is transmitted to the user terminal along with the network program.<br><br>
According to the above method provided by the invention, the user terminal cnh needs to<br>
transmit once a request to the network server this request includes the configuration<br>
information of the font data at the user terminal, then the network program and font data<br>
supporting playing of the network program can be downloaded and obtained. The network<br>
server finishes analysis and comparison of the font required by network programs and the<br>
configuration information of the font data that the user terminal has, determines and<br>
transmits the font that needs to be downloaded to the user terminal.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an apparatus 500 for configuring software resources in a<br>
network server according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig. 5,<br>
apparatus 500 comprises a receiving means for receiving a request for downloading<br>
network programs from the user terminal, the request including the configuration<br>
information of font data at the user terminal.<br>
Apparatus 500 further comprises an acquiring means 520 for acquiring the font data<br>
required for playing network programs. If the description information of network programs<br>
contains the requirement information for playing the needed font, then the function of said<br>
acquiring means 520 includes acquiring requirement information for font data.<br>
Apparatus 500 further comprises a comparing means 530 for comparing the information of<br>
font data required for playing network programs with the information of font data at the<br>
user terminal so as to determine the information of font data to be transmitted to the user<br>
terminal, which generally refers to the font data that are required for playing network<br>
program but are absent at the user terminal.<br>
Apparatus 500 further comprises a transmitting means 540 for transmitting to the user<br>
terminal the determined font data and network program that need to be transmitted to the<br>
user terminal.<br>
Apparatus 500 further comprises a data encapsulating means for encapsulating the contents<br>
of network programs that are requested to be played and the font data that are needed by<br>
said program but are absent at the user terminal to form feedback data packets to be<br>
transmitted to the user terminal. Then these packets are transmitted to the user terminal via<br>
means 540. The data encapsulation can be carried out in various manners, for example, it is<br>
performed following Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions MIME (RFC2557)<br>
specification.<br>
With means 500, the network server can, according to the received information of the font<br>
data at the user terminal and the information of the font data required for playing said<br><br>
network program, determine the information of the font data to be transmitted to the user terminal. This relieves the data processing procedure of the playing apparatus at the user terminal and simplifies the process of downloading and playing network programs.
