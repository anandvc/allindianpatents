				<td>6-AMINO(AZA)INDANE COMPOUNDS SUITABLE FOR TREATING DISORDERS THAT RESPOND TO MODULATION OF THE DOPAMINE D3 RECEPTOR<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel 6-amino(aza)indane compounds. The compounds possess valuable therapeutic properties and are suitable, in particular, for treating diseases that respond to modulation of the dopamine D3 receptor.<br>
Neurons obtain their information byway of G protein-coupled receptors, inter alia. A large number of substances exert their effect by way of these receptors. One of them is dopamine. Confirmed findings exist with regard to the presence of dopamine and its physiological function as a neurotransmitter. Disorders in the dopaminergic transmitter system result in diseases of the central nervous system which include, for example, schizophrenia, depression and Parkinson's disease. These diseases, and others, are treated with drugs which interact with the dopamine receptors.<br>
Up until 1990, two subtypes of dopamine receptor had been clearly defined pharmacologically, namely the DI and D2 receptors. More recently, a third subtype was found, namely the D3 receptor which appears to mediate some effects of antipsychotics and antiparkinsonians (J.C. Schwartz et al., The Dopamine D3 Receptor as a Target for Antipsychotics, in Novel Antipsychotic Drugs, H.Y. Meltzer, Ed. Raven Press, New York 1992, pages 135-144; M. Dooley et al., Drugs and Aging 1998,12, 495-514, J.N. Joyce, Pharmacology and Therapeutics 2001, 90, pp. 231-59 "The Dopamine D3 Receptor as a Therapeutic Target for Antipsychotic and Antiparkinsonian Drugs").<br>
Since then, the dopamine receptors have been divided into two families. On the one hand, there is the D2 group, consisting of D2, D3 and D4 receptors, and, on the other hand, the D) group, consisting of D, and D5 receptors. Whereas D^ and D2 receptors are widely distributed, D3 receptors appear to be expressed regloselectively. Thus, these receptors are preferentially to be found in the limbic system and the projection regions of the mesolimbic dopamine system, especially in the nucleus accumbens, but also in other regions, such as the amygdala. Because of this comparatively regioselec-tive expression, D3 receptors are regarded as being a target having few side-effects and it is assumed that while a selective D3 ligand would have the properties of known antipsychotics, it would not have their dopamine D2 receptor-mediated neurological side-effects (P. Sokoloff et al., Localization and Function of the D3 Dopamine Receptor,<br>
Arzneim. Forsch./Drua Res. 42(1). 224 (1992); P. Sokoloff et al. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel Dopamine Receptor (D3) as a Target for Neuroleptics, Nature. 347. 146(1990)).<br>
6-aminoindane compounds having an affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor have been described in WO 95/04713, WO 96/23760 and WO 97/45403. Some of these compounds possess high affinities for the dopamine D3 receptor. They have therefore been proposed as being suitable for treating diseases of the central nervous system. Unfortunately their affinity and selectivity towards the D3 receptor or their pharmacological profile are not satisfactory. Consequently there is an ongoing need to provide new compounds, which either have an high affinity and an improved selectivity. The compounds should also have good pharmacological profile, e.g. a high brain plasma ratio, a high bioavailability, a good metabolic stability or a decreased inhibition of the mitochondria! respiration.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing compounds which act as highly selective dopamine D3 receptor ligands. This object is surprisingly achieved by means of 6-amino(aza)indane compound of the formula I<br><br><br>

The thus obtained compound III is reacted with an arylchlorosulfonylchloride CI-SO2-Ar, preferably in the presence of a base, according to standard procedures in the art to obtain compound IV. The reaction depicted in scheme 1 step b) takes place under the reaction conditions which are customary for preparing arylsulfonamide compounds or arylsulfonic esters, respectively, and which are described, for example, in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985 p 444 and the literature cited therein, European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (1977), 12(1), 81-66, European J. Org. Chem. 2002 (13), pp. 2094-2108, Tetrahedron 2001, 57 (27) pp. 5885-5895, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2000, 10(8), pp. 835-838 and Synthesis 2000 (1), pp. 103-108. The reaction customarily takes place in an inert solvent, for example in an ether, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, a halohydrocarbon, such as dichloro-methane, an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, such as pentane, hexane or cyclohexane, or an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene, xylene, cumene and the like, or in a mixture of the abovementioned solvents.

If R in compound I' or I" is allyl the allyl group can be cleaved to obtain a compound I1 or I" wherein R is hydrogen.

hexylphosphine, and especially with phosphine chelate ligands, such as 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl or 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane, using methods known from the literature (with regard to eliminating N-allyl in the presence of mercaptobenzoic acid, see WO 94/24088; with regard to eliminating in the presence of 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid, see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123 (28), pp. 6801-6808 and J. Org. Chem 2002, 67(11) pp. 3718-3723). Alternatively, the cleavage of N-allyl can also be effected by reacting in the presence of rhodium compounds, such as tris(triphenylphosphine)chlororhodium(l), using methods known from the literature (see J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Transaction I: Organic and Bio-Organic Chemistry 1999 (21) pp. 3089-3104 and Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1997, 8(20), pp. 3387 - 3391).<br>
The resulting compound I' or I" [R1 = H] can then be reacted, in a known manner, in the sense of an alkylation, with a compound R1-X.

The reaction conditions which are required for the alkylation have been adequately disclosed, e.g. in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Lett. 2002, 12(7), pp. 2443-2446 and also 2002,12(5), pp. 1917-1919.<br>
The alkylation of I' and I" [R = H] can also be achieved, in the sense of a reductive amination, by reacting I [R1 = H] with a suitable ketone or aldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent, e.g. in the presence of a borohydride such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. The skilled person is familiar with the reaction conditions which are required for a reductive amination, e.g. from Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Lett. 2002, 12(5), pp. 795-798 and 12(7) pp. 1269-1273.<br>
In case R in formula I1 or I" is hydrogen, compound I' can be reacted with an acyl halide to obtain a compound of the formula I wherein R1 is d-C3-alkylcarbonyl. The carbonyl group in these compounds can be reduced with diborane to obtain compounds of the general formula I, wherein R is C2-C4-alkyl. The carbonyl group can also be reacted with a fluorinating agent to obtain a compound I wherein R1 is 1,1-difluoroalkyl. J. Acy-lation and reduction can be achieved by standard methods, which are discussed in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed. J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1985, p.370 and 373 (acylation) and p. 1099 f. and in the literature cited in this publication (with<br><br>
regard to acylation, see also Synth. Commun. 1986,16, p. 267, and with regard to reduction, see also J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1979, 16, p. 1525).<br>
As an alternative, compounds II can also be reacted with an arylsulfonylamide Ar-SO2-NH2 or the lithium salt thereof in the presence of a palladium(O) compound such as tris(dibenylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) in the presence of a tri(substituted)phosphine, e.g. a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine or tritolyl-phosphien, tri(cyclo)alkylphosphin such as tris-n-butylphosphine, tris(tert.-butyl)phosphine or tris(cyclohexylphosphine), preferably in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride according to the method described in J. Org. Chem., 68 (2993) pp 8274-8276.<br>
Compounds of the formula I, wherein R1a and R2 together are (CH2)n with n being 2 or 3 can be prepared in manner similar to the method outlined in scheme 1 starting from a compound of the formula V, by the method outlined in scheme 2:<br>

In scheme 2, R2a, n and Ar have the meanings given above. R is a radical R1 or an amino protecting group. In particular R1 is CT-C<br>
The reaction depicted in step a) in scheme 2 takes place under the reaction conditions which are customary for a nitration of an aromatic radical and which are described, for<br>
example, in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1985, pp 468-470 and the literature cited therein).<br>
In step b), the nitro group in VI is reduced to the NH2 group in VII. Subsequently, in step c), the NH2 group can be converted into a -NR3'H group, in which R3' has the meanings different from hydrogen which are specified for R3. The reaction conditions which are required for step b) correspond to the customary conditions for reducing aromatic nitro groups which have been described extensively in the literature (see, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New-York, 1985, p. 1183 and the literature cited in this reference). The reduction is achieved, for example, by reacting the nitro compound VI with a metal such as iron, zinc or tin under acidic reaction conditions, i.e. using nascent hydrogen, or using a complex hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride, preferably in the presence of transition metal compounds of nickel or cobalt such as NiCI2(P(phenyl)3)2, or CoCI2,(see Ono et al. Chem. Ind. (London), 1983 p.480), or using NaBH2S3 (see Lalan-cette et al. Can. J. Chem. 49, 1971, p. 2990), with it being possible to carry out these reductions, depending on the given reagent, in substance or in a solvent or diluent. Alternatively, the reduction of VI to VII can be carried out with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, e.g. using hydrogen in the presence of catalysts based on platinum, palladium, nickel, ruthenium or rhodium. The catalysts can contain the transition metal in elemental form or in the form of a complex compound, of a salt or of an oxide of the transition metal, with it being possible, for the purpose of modifying the activity, to use customary coligands, e.g. organic phosphine compounds, such as triphenylphosphine, tricyclohexylphosphine or tri-n-butylphosphines or phosphites. The catalyst is customarily employed in quantities of from 0.001 to 1 mol per mol of compound VI, calculated as catalyst metal. In a preferred variant, the reduction is effected using tin(ll) chloride in analogy with the methods described in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2002, 12(15), pp. 1917-1919 and J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(21), pp. 4679-4688. The reaction of VII with tin(ll) chloride is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, preferably an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or bu-tanol.<br>
Step c) in scheme 2 corresponds to step b in scheme 1, which can be performed in analogous manner. Thereby a compound of the general formula VIM is obtained which for R = R1 corresponds to formula I, wherein R1a and R2 form a (CH2)n moiety.<br><br>

Scheme 3: (Figure Removed) <br><br><br><br>
Starting from cyclopent-2-enone, selective Michael addition of a carbamate RXO-C(O)-NH2, in the presence of bismuth nitrate, generates the requisite p-amino ke-tone IX (step a, see e.g. (J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68, 2109-2114). In step b), compound IX undergoes Tohda reaction with dinitropyridone to give the azabicyclic nitro derivative X (step c), see e.g. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1990, 63, 2820-2827; J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 2844-2851; Synth. Commun. 2001, 31, 787-797; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003, 13, 529-532). This generates a mixture of the 5- and 7-amino isomers which can be separated as either the amino or sulfonarnide product. The mixture can then be reduced to the amine by the methods disclosed for step b in scheme 2, e.g. via tin chloride or catalytic hydrogenation (e.g. Pd-C/H2) and subsequently converted to the desired sulfonarnide by reaction with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride as outlined for step b) in scheme 1 to yield a compound of the formula XI. The amine XII may be generated by cleavage<br><br>
of the carbamate in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid and converted to the target N-alkyl derivatives by processes of alkylation, acylation/reduction or reductive amination as outlined for scheme 1.<br>
Compounds of the formula II are known in the art. They can also be prepared from 6-amino(aza)indanes of the formula XIII by the synthetic scheme outlined in scheme 4:(Figure Removed) <br><br><br><br><br>
In scheme 4, R1a, R2, R2a, PG and X have the meanings given above. R is a radical R1, which is different from alkenyl or fluorinated alkenyl. In step a) the compound XIII is reacted with bromine to obtain compound XIV. The enantiomerically pure (S)- or (R)-aminoindanes XIV are e.g. prepared via crystallization of the racemic bromo-indan-2-yl-amine XIV with either (S)~ or (R)-IO-camphersulfonic acid (Adv. Synth. Catal., 2001, 343, 5, 461-472). In step b) a protective group PG is introduced by standard methods. For R1a being hydrogen, the radical R is introduced by standard alkylation or acylation methods (step c).<br>

Scheme 5b:(Figure Removed) <br><br><br>
In schemes 5a and 5b, n, R2, R2a, PG, Ar and X have the meanings given above. R is a radical R1 or hydrogen. According to scheme 5a, the methyl group in compound XV is selectively brominated to yield compound XVI, which is reacted in step b) with mer-capto compound HS-Ar in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride or sodium alkoxide or with an alkali metal salt thereof thereby yielding thioether compound XVII. The thioether moiety in compound is oxidized to a sulfone moiety, e.g. by oxone, and the protective group PG is cleaved, thereby obtaining compound I', wherein the group R can be transformed as outlined for scheme 1. A simlar reaction sequence can be applied to the compounds of the general formula XVa (scheme 5b).<br>
A skilled person will readily appreciate that compopunds of the formula I can also be obtained from structurally similar compounds by functional group interconversion. In particular N-bound radicals Ra can be introduced into compounds of the formula I by<br><br>
reacting the corresponding halogen compound, i.e. a compound of the formula I, which instead of Ra carries a halogen atom, in particular a bromine or iodine atom, with a primary or secondary amine in the presence of a base, preferably also in the presence of a palladium catalyst in terms of a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction.<br>

Alternatively, the activation energy which is required for the reaction can be introduced into the reaction mixture using microwaves, something which has proved to be of value, in particular, in the case of the reactions catalyzed by transition metals (with regard to reactions using microwaves, see Tetrahedron 2001, 57, p. 9199 ff. p. 9225 ff. and also, in a general manner, "Microwaves in Organic Synthesis", Andr6 Loupy (Ed.), Wiley-VCH 2002.<br>
The sulfonylchlorides CI-SOa-Ar are either commercially available or can be prepared according to standard synthetic methods. Sulfonylchlorides containing a fluorinated radical Ra may be prepared by different synthetic routes, e.g. by reacting suitable hy-droxy or oxo precursor (e.g. a compound CI-SO2-Ar, carrying a hydroxy or oxo substituted radical) with fluorinating reagents like DAST (diethylaminosulfurtrifluoride), mor-pholine-DAST, deoxo-fluor (bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride), Ishikawa's reagent (N,N-diethyl-(1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl)amine; Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 1989, 43, 371-377). More conventionally, the hydroxy group of an aromatic compound which carries a hydroxy substituted radical but not a chlorosulfonyl group, is transformed into a leaving group which is then replaced by a fluoride ion (J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 2898-22901; Tetrahedron Letters, 1998, 7305-6; J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63, 9587-9589, Synthesis, 1987, 920-21)). Subsequent direct chlorosulfonylation with chlo-rosulfonic acid (Heterocycles, 2001, 55, 9, 1789-1803; J. Org. Chem., 2000, 65, 1399-1406) or a two step process preparing first the sulfonic acid derivatives which are then transformed to the sulfonylchlorides with e.g. chlorosulfonic acid, phosphorour penta-chloride (Eur. J. Med. Chem., 2002, 36, 809-828) and the like, yields the desired sul-fonylchloride (Tetrahedron Letters, 1991, 33,50 7787-7788)) Sulfonylchlorides may also be prepared by diazotation of suitable amine precursor Ar-NH2 with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions and reaction with sulfur dioxide in acetic acid (scheme (iii); J. Org. Chem., 1960, 25, 1824-26;); by oxidation of suitable heteroaryl-thiols HS-Ar or heteroaryl-benzyl-thioethers C6H5-CH2-S-Ar with chlorine (Synthesis, 1998, 36-38; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1950, 74, 4890-92;) directly to the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides. The further are known in the art or may be prepared by standard methods. E.g. mer-<br>
capto-pyrimidines or pyrimidinyl-benzylthioether precursors can e.g. be prepared according to literature (Chemische Berichte, 1960, 1208-11; Chemische Berichte, 1960, 95, 230-235; Collection Czechoslow. Chem. Comm., 1959, 24, 1667-1671; Austr. J. Chem., 1966, 19, 2321-30; Chemiker-Zeitung, 101, 6, 1977, 305-7; Tetrahedron, 2002, 58, 887-890; Synthesis, 1983, 641-645.<br>
In the following schemes 6 to 8 several routes are shown which are suitable to prepare benzenesulfonyl chlorides carrying a fluorinated propyl radical.<br>
Scheme 6: (Figure Removed) <br>
The 4-(1,1-difluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-suIfonyl chloride intermediate can be prepared from the commercially available 2-phenylpropanoic acid. In the first step a) the 2-phenylpropanic acid is converted to the alkyl ester by esterification with an alcohol (e.g. methanol or ethanol) under acid catalysis (e.g. HCI, SO2CI2). The ester can be reduced to the corresponding 2-phenyl propanal by a reducing agent such as DIBAL (diisobutylaluminium hydride). The aldehyde is converted to the 1,1-difluoro-2-propyl derivative by reaction with a suitable fluorinating reagent like DAST (diethylaminosul-furtrifluoride), morpholine-DAST, deoxo-fluor (bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride), Ishikawa's reagent (N.N-diethyKI.I^.S.S.S-hexafluoropropyOamine; Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 1989, 43, 371-377) (step b). The thus obtained 1,1-difluoro-2-phenylpropane can be converted into 4-(1,1-difluoro-2-propyl)benzenesulfonyl chloride by either direct chlorosulfonylation with chlorosulfonic acid (Heterocycles, 2001, 55, 9, 1789-1803; J. Org. Chem., 2000, 65, 1399-1406) (step c) or by a two step process preparing first the sulfonic acid derivatives (step d) which are then transformed to the suifonylchlorides (step e) by reaction with e.g. chlorosulfonic acid, phosphorous pentachloride (Eur. J. Med. Chem., 2002, 36, 809-828); through diazotisation of suitable amine precursors with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions and reaction with<br><br>
sulfur dioxide in acetic acid (J. Org. Chem., 1960, 25, 1824-26); oxidation of suitable heteroaryl-thiols or heteroaryl-benzyl-thioethers with chlorine (Synthesis, 1998, 36-38; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1950, 74, 4890-92) directly to the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
The synthesis shown in scheme 6 can also be performed using (R)-2-phenylpropanic acid and (S)-2-phenylpropanic acid respectively to give the corresponding chiral 4-(1,1-difluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1 -sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
Scheme 7:(Figure Removed) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
4-(1,1,1-Trifluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-ulfonyl chloride intermediate can be prepared from the commercially available 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-phenylethanone by a synthetic route shown in scheme 7. The ketone can be converted to the 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-phenylpropene by a Wittig reaction with a suitable ylide such as methylene-triphenylphosphane (prepared by reaction of methyltriphenylphosphonium halide and a suitable base such as lithium diisopropylamide or potassium tert-butoxide) or according to a Horner-Emmons reaction by reacting the ketone with a suitable phosphonate such as diethyl methylphosphonate and a suitable suitable base such as lithium diisopropylamide or potassium tert-butoxide. The thus obtained 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-phenylpropene can then be reduced to the saturated alkane by catalytic hydrogenation (eg Pd-C) followed by conversion to the sulfonyl chloride by the methods described in scheme 6.<br>
The synthesis of scheme 7 can also be performed using a chiral catalyst for the alkene hydrogenation to allow the preparation of the corresponding chiral 4-(1,1,1-triifluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
Scheme 8: (Figure Removed)  <br>
The 4-(1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonyl chloride can be also prepared from the commercially available 1-phenyl-ethanone by a four step procedure as shown in scheme 8. The ketone can be converted to the trifluoromethyl hydroxyl intermediate by reaction with trimethyl-trifluoromethyl-silane (Journal of Organic Chemistry, 2000, 65, 8848-8856; Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 2003, 122, 243-246) which can then be converted to the trifluoromethyl bromide (Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1987, 109, 2435-4). Dehalogenation by catalytic hydrogenation (eg Pd-C) can then be followed by conversion to the sulfonyl chloride by the methods discussed above.<br>
Examples of solvents which can be used are ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl ferf-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, aprotic polar solvent, such as dimethyl-formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethoxyethane, and acetonitrile, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene, ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, halohydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane and dichloroethane, esters, such as ethyl acetate and methyl butyrate, carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid or propionic acid, and alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, 2-butanol and tert.-butanol.<br>
If desired, it is possible for a base to be present in order to neutralize protons which are released in the reactions. Suitable bases include inorganic bases, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate, and, in addition, alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride, and also organometallic compounds, such as butyllithium compounds or alkylmagnesium compounds, or organic nitrogen bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The latter compounds can at the same time serve as solvents.<br><br>
The crude product is isolated in a customary manner, for example by filtering, distilling off the solvent or extracting from the reaction mixture, etc. The resulting compounds can be purified in a customary manner, for example by means of recrystallizing from a solvent, by means of chromatography or by means of converting into an acid addition salt.<br>
The acid addition salts are prepared in a customary manner by mixing the free base with a corresponding acid, where appropriate in solution in an organic solvent, for example a lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, an ether, such as methyl terf-butyl ether or diisopropyl ether, a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
The compounds according to the invention of the formula I are surprisingly highly selective dopamine D3 receptor ligands which, because of their low affinity for other receptors such as D! receptors, D4 receptors, cr1-adrenergic and/or a2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinergic receptors, histamine receptors, opiate receptors and, in particular, dopamine D2 receptors, give rise to fewer side-effects than do the classic neuroleptics, which are D2 receptor antagonists. A compound of the invention can be a dopamine D3 receptor agonist, including partial agonistic activity, or a dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, including partial antagonistic activity.<br>
The high affinity of the compounds according to the invention for D3 receptors is reflected in very low in-vitro receptor binding constants (K)(D3) values) of as a rule less than 50 nM (nmol/l), preferably of less than 10 nM and, in particular of less than 5 nM. The displacement of [125l]-iodosulpride can, for example, be used in receptor binding studies for determining binding affinities for D3 receptors.<br>
The selectivity of the compounds according to the invention, i.e. the ratio Ki(D2)/Ki(D3) of the receptor binding constants, is as a rule at least 50, preferably at least 100, even better at least 150. The displacement of [3H]SCH23390, [125I] iodosulpride or [125I] spiperone can be used, for example, for carrying out receptor binding studies on D-\, D2 and D4 receptors.<br>
Because of their binding profile, the compounds can be used for treating diseases which respond to dopamine D3 receptor ligands (or which are susceptible to treatment with a dopamine D3 receptor ligand, respectively), i.e. they are effective for treating those medical disorders or diseases in which exerting an influence on (modulating) the<br><br>
dopamine D3 receptors leads to an improvement in the clinical picture or to the disease being cured. Examples of these diseases are disorders or diseases of the central nervous system.<br>
Disorders or diseases of the central nervous system are understood as meaning disorders which affect the spinal chord and, in particular, the brain. Within the meaning of the invention, the term "disorder" denotes disturbances and/or anomalies which are as a rule regarded as being pathological conditions or functions and which can manifest themselves in the form of particular signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. While the treatment according to the invention can be directed toward individual disorders, i.e. anomalies or pathological conditions, it is also possible for several anomalies, which may be causatively linked to each other, to be combined into patterns, i.e. syndromes, which can be treated in accordance with the invention.<br>
The disorders which can be treated in accordance with the invention are, in particular, psychiatric and neurological disturbances. These disturbances include, in particular, organic disturbances, including symptomatic disturbances, such as psychoses of the acute exogenous reaction type or attendant psychoses of organic or exogenous cause, e.g., in association with metabolic disturbances, infections and endocrinopathogies; endogenous psychoses, such as schizophrenia and schizotype and delusional disturbances; affective disturbances, such as depressions, mania and/or manic-depressive conditions; and also mixed forms of the above-described disturbances; neurotic and somatoform disturbances and also disturbances in association with stress; dissociative disturbances, e.g. loss of consciousness, clouding of consciousness, double consciousness and personality disturbances; disturbances in attention and waking/sleeping behavior, such as behavioral disturbances and emotional disturbances whose onset lies in childhood and youth, e.g. hyperactivity in children, intellectual deficits, in particular attention disturbances (attention deficit disorders), memory disturbances and cognitive disturbances, e.g. impaired learning and memory (impaired cognitive function), dementia, narcolepsy and sleep disturbances, e.g. restless legs syndrome; development disturbances; anxiety states, delirium; sexlife disturbances, e.g. impotence in men; eating disturbances, e.g. anorexia or bulimia; addiction; and other unspecified psychiatric disturbances.<br>
The disorders which can be treated in accordance with the invention also include Parkinson's disease and epilepsy and, in particular, the affective disturbances connected thereto.<br>
The addiction diseases include psychic disorders and behavioral disturbances which are caused by the abuse of psychotropic substances, such as Pharmaceuticals or narcotics, and also other addiction diseases, such as addiction to gaming (impulse control disorders not elsewhere classified). Examples of addictive substances are: opioids (e.g. morphine, heroin and codeine), cocaine; nicotine; alcohol; substances which interact with the GABA chloride channel complex, sedatives, hypnotics and tranquilizers, for example benzodiazepines; LSD; cannabinoids; psychomotor stimulants, such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (ecstasy); amphetamine and amphetamine-like substances such as methylphenidate and other stimulants including caffeine. Addictive substances which come particularly into consideration are opioids, cocaine, amphetamine or amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol.<br>
With regard to the treatment of addiction diseases, particular preference is given to those compounds according to the invention of the formula I which themselves do not possess any psychotropic effect. This can also be observed in a test using rats, which, after having been administered compounds which can be used in accordance with the invention, reduce their self administration of psychotropic substances, for example cocaine.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for treating disorders whose causes can at least partially be attributed to an anomalous activity of dopamine D3 receptors.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the treatment is directed, in particular, toward those disorders which can be influenced, within the sense of an expedient medicinal treatment, by the binding of preferably exogeneously administered binding partners (ligands) to dopamine D3 receptors.<br>
The diseases which can be treated with the compounds according to the invention are frequently characterized by progressive development, i.e. the above-described conditions change over the course of time; as a rule, the severity increases and conditions may possibly merge into each other or other conditions may appear in addition to those which already exist.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used to treat a large number of signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions which are connected with the disorders of the<br><br>
central nervous system and, in particular, the abovementioned conditions. These signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions include, for example, a disturbed relationship to reality, lack of insight and ability to meet customary social norms or the demands made by life, changes in temperament, changes in individual drives, such as hunger, sleep, thirst, etc., and in mood, disturbances in the ability to observe and combine, changes in personality, in particular emotional lability, hallucinations, ego-disturbances, distracted-ness, ambivalence, autism, depersonalization and false perceptions, delusional ideas, chanting speech, lack of synkinesia, short-step gait, flexed posture of trunk and limbs, tremor, poverty of facial expression, monotonous speech, depressions, apathy, impeded spontaneity and decisiveness, impoverished association ability, anxiety, nervous agitation, stammering, social phobia, panic disturbances, withdrawal symptoms in association with dependency, maniform syndromes, states of excitation and confusion, dysphoria, dyskinetic syndromes and tic disorders, e.g. Huntington's chorea and Gilles-de-la-Tourette's syndrome, vertigo syndromes, e.g. peripheral positional, rotational and oscillatory vertigo, melancholia, hysteria, hypochondria and the like.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, a treatment also includes a preventive treatment (prophylaxis), in particular as relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis, as well as the treatment of acute or chronic signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. The treatment can be orientated symptomatically, for example as the suppression of symptoms. It can be effected over a short period, be orientated over the medium term or can be a long-term treatment, for example within the context of a maintenance therapy.<br>
Therefore the compounds according to the invention are preferentially suitable for treating diseases of the central nervous system, in particular for treating affective disorders; neurotic disturbances, stress disturbances and somatoform disturbances and psychoses, and, in particular, for treating schizophrenia and depression. Because of their high selectivity with regard to the D3 receptor, the compounds I according to the invention are also suitable for treating disturbances of kidney function, in particular disturbances of kidney function which are caused by diabetes mellitus (see WO 00/67847) and, especially, diabetic nephropathy.<br>
Within the context of the treatment, the use according to the invention of the described compounds involves a method. In this method, an effective quantity of one or more compounds, as a rule formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical and veterinary practice, is administered to the individual to be treated, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Whether such a treat-<br><br>
ment is indicated, and in which form it is to take place, depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) which takes into consideration signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions which are present, the risks of developing particular signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions, and other factors.<br>
As a rule, the treatment is effected by means of single or repeated daily administration, where appropriate together, or alternating, with other active compounds or active compound-containing preparations such that a daily dose of preferably from about 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg of bodyweight, in the case of oral administration, or of from about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of bodyweight, in the case of parenteral administration, is supplied to an individual to be treated.<br>
The invention also relates to the production of pharmaceutical compositions for treating an individual, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Thus, the ligands are customarily administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient together with at least one compound according to the invention and, where appropriate, other active compounds. These compositions can, for example, be administered orally, rectally, transdermally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly or intranasally.<br>
Examples of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are solid medicinal forms, such as powders, granules, tablets, in particular film tablets, lozenges, sachets, cachets, sugar-coated tablets, capsules, such as hard gelatin capsules and soft gelatin capsules, suppositories or vaginal medicinal forms, semisolid medicinal forms, such as ointments, creams, hydrogels, pastes or plasters, and also liquid medicinal forms, such as solutions, emulsions, in particular oil-in-water emulsions, suspensions, for example lotions, injection preparations and infusion preparations, and eyedrops and eardrops. Implanted release devices can also be used for administering inhibitors according to the invention. In addition, it is also possible to use liposomes or microspheres.<br>
When producing the compositions, the compounds according to the invention are optionally mixed or diluted with one or more excipients. Excipients can be solid, semisolid or liquid materials which serve as vehicles, carriers or medium for the active compound.<br>
Suitable excipients are listed in the specialist medicinal monographs. In addition, the formulations can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or customary auxiliary<br><br>
substances, such as glidants; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preservatives; antioxidants; antiirritants; chelating agents; coating auxiliaries; emulsion stabilizers; film formers; gel formers; odor masking agents; taste corrigents; resin; hy-drocolloids; solvents; solubilizers; neutralizing agents; diffusion accelerators; pigments; quaternary ammonium compounds; refatting and overfatting agents; raw materials for ointments, creams or oils; silicone derivatives; spreading auxiliaries; stabilizers; steri-lants; suppository bases; tablet auxiliaries, such as binders, fillers, glidants, disinte-grants or coatings; propellents; drying agents; opacifiers; thickeners; waxes; plasticiz-ers and white mineral oils. A formulation in this regard is based on specialist knowledge as described, for example, in Fiedler, H.P., Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fQr Pharmazie, Kos-metik und angrenzende Gebiete [Encyclopedia of auxiliary substances for pharmacy, cosmetics and related fields], 4th edition, Aulendorf: ECV-Editio-Kantor-Verlag, 1996.<br>
The following examples serve to explain the invention without limiting it.<br>
The compounds were either characterized via proton-NMR in d6-dimethylsulfoxid or d-chloroform on a 400 MHz or 500 MHz NMR instrument (Bruker AVANCE), or by mass spectrometry, generally recorded via HPLC-MS in a fast gradient on CIS-material (electrospray-ionisation (ESI) mode), or melting point.<br>
The magnetic nuclear resonance spectral properties (NMR) refer to the chemical shifts (5) expressed in parts per million (ppm). The relative area of the shifts in the 1H NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of hydrogen atoms for a particular functional type in the molecule. The nature of the shift, as regards multiplicity, is indicated as singlet (s), broad singlet (s. br.), doublet (d), broad doublet (d br.), triplet (t), broad triplet (t br.), quartet (q), quintet (quint.) and multiplet (m).<br>
