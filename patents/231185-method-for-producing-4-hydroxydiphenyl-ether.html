Technical Field<br>
The present invention provides a method for producing 4-hydroxydiphenyl ether.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
4-hydroxydiphenyl ether is a useful compound as the intermediate for pesticides, Pharmaceuticals, perfume and plastics.  As a method for producing 4-hydroxydiphenyl ether, for example, methods for forming an ether bond among two phenyl groups newly such as a condensation reaction of phenol and a 4-hydroxyhalobenzene (e.g. JP 47-34324 A); a condensation reaction of phenol or a halobenzene and hydroquinone (e.g. JP 55-62033 A and JP 56-135437 A); a condensation reaction of 4-isopropylphenol and halobenzene following a cumene method (e.g. JP 56-59726 A); and a method for carrying out a condensation reaction of phenol and 4-nitrohalobenzene, a reduction of the nitro group, and a diazotization decomposition in sequence (e.g. JP 53-56630 A); are exemplified.  However, these methods have problems that high temperature was needed because of low reactivity and they were long process.  They have been not satisfactory enough as industrial methods.<br><br><br><br>
First, the step for producing a 4-acyldiphenyl ether represented by the formula (1) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the 4-acyldiphenyl ether (1)) by reacting diphenyl ether with an acylating agent in the presence of an acid catalyst will be illustrated.<br>
As the acylating agent, for example, a compound represented by the formula (3):<br>
R-C(O)~X       (3)<br>
wherein R represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl group, and X represents a halogen atom (for example, a chlorine or bromine atom) or O-(O)C-R group, herein R represents the same meaning as the above, is exemplified.<br>
Examples of the unsubstituted alkyl groups include Cl-10 alkyl groups such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl and decyl group.  Examples of the unsubstituted aryl groups include C6-10 phenyl and naphthyl group.<br>

Among these acylating agents, the carboxylic anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, isobutyric anhydride and benzoic anhydride, and the carboxylic chlorides such as acetyl chloride, acetyl bromide, propionyl chloride and hexanoyl chloride are preferably used.<br>
In the formula (3), R represents R'-CH2- group more preferably, herein R' represents a hydrogen atom or a Cl-9 alkyl group as the above.  That is, the carboxylic anhydrides (for example, acetic anhydride, propionic<br><br>
anhydride and butyric anhydride) wherein the primary carbon of the alkyl group or methyl group is bonded to a carbonyl group and the corresponding carboxylic chloride are even more preferable.  Among them, the carboxylic anhydrides (for example, acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride and butyric anhydride) are still more preferable.<br>

The amount of the organic solvent is not particularly limited.<br>
The solvolysis reaction is usually carried out under a<br><br>
basic condition or an acidic condition.  When the solvolysis reaction is carried out under the basic condition, a Bronsted base or a Lewis base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate and ammonia is usually used as the base and the bases are used alone or in the form of a mixture.  When the solvolysis reaction is carried out under the acidic condition, a Bronsted acid or a Lewis acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, boric acid, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, ferrous chloride, ferric chloride, ferrous bromide, ferric bromide, zinc chloride, zinc bromide, zinc iodide, titanium tetrachloride and boron trifluoride is usually used as the acid and the acids are used alone or in the form of a mixture.  The amount of the base or the acid to be used is not particularly limited, and it is usually about 0.001 to 10 moles per 1 mole of the 4-acyloxydiphenyl ether (2).<br>
The reaction temperature of the solvolysis reaction is usually in the range of about 0 to 100°C.<br>
After completion of the solvolysis reaction, an organic layer containing 4-hydroxydiphenyl ether is obtained by adding a water-insoluble organic solvent if necessary to the reaction mixture to conduct extracting<br><br>
treatment.  4-hydroxydiphenyl ether can be isolated by concentrating the organic layer as it is.  4-hydroxydiphenyl ether isolated can be further purified, if necessary, for example, by distillation, recrystallization or column chromatography.<br>

After cooling the reaction solution, 10 mL of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution was added thereto and extracting treatment was carried out using 20 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether and the organic layer obtained was concentrated.  The concentrated solution obtained was dissolved in 2.5 mL of methanol and 2 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added thereto and the resulting mixture was stirred at 40°C for 4 hours.  This reaction mixture was determined quantity by LC to find the yield of 4-hydroxydiphenyl ether was 75%.<br><br>
