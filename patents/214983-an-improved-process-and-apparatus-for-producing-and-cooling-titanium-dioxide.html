				<td>"IMPROVED PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING AND COOLING TITANIUM<br>
DIOXIDE"<br>
The present invention relates to processes and apparatus for producing and<br>
cooling titanium dioxide, and more particularly, to such processes and apparatus<br>
wherein the cooling of the titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction products produced is<br>
more efficiently carried out.<br>
In the conventional production of titanium dioxide utilizing the chloride<br>
process, heated gaseous titanium tetrachloridc and heated oxygen are combined in a<br>
tubular reactor at high flow rates. A high temperature oxidation reaction takes place<br>
in the reactor whereby paniculate solid titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction<br>
products arc produced. The titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction products are<br>
cooled by passing them through a tubular heat exchanger along with a scouring<br>
medium for removing deposits from the inside surfaces of the heat exchanger. The<br>
scouring medium is a paniculate solid such as sand, sintered or compressed titanium<br>
dioxide, rock salt or the like. In spite of the use of a scouring medium, the solid<br>
titanium dioxide and other deposits on the inside surfaces of the tubular heat<br>
exchanger have only been partially removed in the known processes, thereby leaving<br>
deposits which reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the heat exchanger.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process and apparatus for<br>
producing and cooling paniculate solid titanium dioxide in which gaseous titanium<br>
tetrachloride and oxygen are reacted, as before, at a high temperature to produce<br>
paniculate solid titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction products. The produced<br>
paniculate solid titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction products are then cooled by<br>
heat exchange with a cooling medium in a tubular heat exchanger. A scouring<br>
medium is injected into the heat exchanger for removing deposits of titanium dioxide<br>
and other materials from the inside surfaces of the heat exchanger. According to the<br>
present invention, however, in order to increase the removal of the deposits from the<br>
surfaces and thereby increase the heat transfer efficiency in the heat exchanger, the<br>
scouring medium is caused to follow a spiral path through the heal exchanger. After<br>
passing through the heat exchanger, the particulate solid titanium dioxide is separated<br>
from the gaseous reaction products according to known practice.<br>
The present invention is more clearly understood by reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURF. 1 is a side cross-sectional view of a tubular heat exchanger section<br>
which includes spiraling vanes and recesses in accordance with this invention; and<br>
FIGURE 2 is an end view taken along line 2-2 of FIG. 1.<br>
Titanium dioxide pigment is produced according to the chloride route by<br>
reacting heated gaseous titanium tetrachloride and heated oxygen in a tubular reactor<br>
at high temperatures. The titanium tetrachloride can include aluminum chloride in an<br>
amount sufficient to produce a rutile pigment containing between 0.3 percent to 3<br>
percent by weight of aluminum oxide. Typically, the titanium tetrachloride is<br>
preheated to a temperature in the range of from 343 degrees Celsius (650°F) to 982<br>
degrees Celsius (1800oF) depending upon the particular preheater apparatus utilized.<br>
The oxygen is typically preheated to a temperature in the range of from 954 degrees<br>
Celsius (1750°F) to 1871 degrees Celsius (3400°F). The oxidation reaction<br>
temperature at a pressure of 1 kg/sq. cm. (one atmosphere) is typically at least 1150<br>
degrees Celsius, more typically being in the range of from 1260 degrees Celsius<br>
(2300°F) to 1371 degrees Celsius (2500°F). The reaction produces paniculate solid<br>
titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction products.<br>
The reaction products are conventionally immediately introduced into an<br>
elongated tubular heat exchanger, wherein the reaction products are cooled by heat<br>
exchange with a cooling medium such as cooling water. The elongated tubular heat<br>
exchanger is usually made up of a plurality of individual heat exchanger sections<br>
which are sealingly bolted together. The heat exchanger sections and overall length<br>
of the heat exchanger can vary widely depending on factors such as the titanium<br>
dioxide production rate, the desired discharge temperature and the diameter of the<br>
heat exchanger among other factors. Consequently, commercial producers of titanium<br>
dioxide that utilize the chloride process, that is, the process of oxidizing titanium<br>
tclrachloride, use heat exchangers of varying diameters and lengths to cool the<br>
reaction products. In known examples, the heat exchanger sections have an internal<br>
diameter of 18 centimeters (7 inches) and are from 2.1 meters (7 feet) to 4.9 meters<br>
(16 feet) long. The elongated tubular heat exchanger often also includes an adapter<br>
section which is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) to 1.2 meters (4 feet) long. While passing<br>
through the elongated tubular heat exchanger, the titanium dioxide and gascous<br>
reaction products are cooled to a temperature of 700 degrees Celsius (1300°F) or less.<br>
In order to prevent the build-up of deposits formed of titanium dioxide and<br>
other materials produced in the oxidation reaction, a scouring medium has been<br>
injected into the tubular heat exchanger along with the reaction products. Examples<br>
of scouring media which can be used include, but arc not limited to, sand, mixtures of<br>
titanium dioxide and water which are pelletized, dried and sintered, compressed<br>
titanium dioxide, rock salt, fused alumina, titanium dioxide and salt mixtures and the<br>
like. The salt mixed with titanium dioxide can be potassium chloride, sodium<br>
chloride and the like.<br>
The scouring medium impinges on the inside surfaces of the heat exchanger<br>
and removes deposits therefrom. While the scouring medium removes some of the<br>
deposits, it often does not remove all of the deposits and as a result, a layer of the<br>
deposits on the inside surfaces of the heat exchanger remains. The remaining layer of<br>
deposited material decreases the heat transfer rate from the reaction products being<br>
cooled through the walls of the heat exchanger and into the cooling medium. This in<br>
turn significantly decreases the efficiency of the heat exchanger and increases the<br>
overall costs of producing the titanium dioxide, by requiring the installation and<br>
maintenance of a longer heat exchanger and requiring a greater amount of the<br>
scouring medium. After the reaction products are cooled, the participate solid<br>
titanium dioxide is separated using conventionally known gas-solids separation<br>
apparatus from the gaseous reaction products and the scouring medium.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that the removal of the<br>
deposits from the inside surfaces of the heat exchanger can be improved by causing<br>
the scouring medium to follow a spiral path through the heat exchanger. While<br>
various techniques can be utilized for causing the scouring medium to follow a spiral<br>
path through the heat exchanger, a presently preferred technique is to provide one or<br>
more spiraling vanes on the inside surfaces of at least a portion of one or more of the<br>
individual heat exchanger sections. Preferably, for 18 cm (7 inch) to 28 cm (11 inch)<br>
internal diameter heat exchanger sections, two or more spiralling vanes having<br>
spiraling recesses therebetween are provided in 2,4 meter (8 foot) portions of two or<br>
more of the individual heat exchanger sections. Most preferably from, four to six<br>
spiraling vanes with four to six spiraling recesses therebetween are provided in the<br>
spiralcd portions of the sections.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, one of the individual 18 cm (7 inch) internal<br>
diameter by 4.8 meter (16 feet) long heat exchanger sections making up an elongated<br>
heat exchanger for cooling the reaction products is illustrated and generally<br>
designated by the numeral 10. The heat exchanger section 10 includes four spiraling<br>
vanes 12 with four recesses 14 therebetween extending over an 2.4 meter (8 foot)<br>
internal portion thereof. As shown in FIG. 1, the vanes 12 and recesses 14 rotate over<br>
the initial 2.4 meter (8 foot) internal surface length of the heat exchanger 10. The rate<br>
of rotation of the spiraling vanes and recesses is constant and is generally in the range<br>
of from 0.8 degrees per centimeter (2 degrees per inch) to 2.4 degrees per centimeter<br>
(6 degrees per inch), preferably being about 1.6 degrees per centimeter (4,5 degrees<br>
per inch). As shown in FIG. 2, the spiraling vanes 12 and recesses 14 have curved<br>
rectangular cross-sectional shapes. Generally, the heights, widths and rate of rotation<br>
of the spiraling vanes are such that for an individual heat exchanger section<br>
containing the vanes over its initial 2.4 meters (8 feet) of internal surface length, the<br>
maximum pressure drop at the maximum reaction products flow rate through the<br>
section is 14.1 g/sq. cm. (0.2 pounds per square inch). A further requirement is that<br>
"the scouring medium completely scours the inside surfaces of the heat exchanger<br>
section including the surfaces of the spiraling recesses. These criteria are met, for<br>
example, by a heat exchanger section having a length of 4.8 meters (16 feet), an<br>
internal surface diameter of 18 cm (7 inches) and having four curved rectangular<br>
 vanes equally spaced over the initial 2.4 meters (8 feet) of internal surface therein<br>
when the vanes arc 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) high, 3,8 cm (1.5 inches) wide and have a rate of<br>
rotation of 1.7 degrees per centimeter (4.3 degrees per inch) and when a scouring<br>
medium having a specific gravity of 2 and a particle size of 0.7 mm (0.028 inch) is<br>
utilized with an inlet gaseous reaction product (low rate of 3 kg (6.6 pounds) per<br>
second at a temperature of 954 degrees Celsius (!750°F).<br>
As mentioned, all of the heat exchanger sections utilized to make up the<br>
elongated tubular heat exchanger can include spiraling vanes and recesses. Generally,<br>
however, the heat exchanger sections which include spiraling vanes and recesses in<br>
the elongated heat exchanger can be separated by several heat exchanger sections<br>
which do not include spiraling vanes and recesses. The number of heat exchanger<br>
sections which do not include vanes and recesses depends on whether those heat<br>
exchanger sections arc thoroughly cleaned by the scouring medium under the<br>
operating conditions involved.<br>
The vanes can be formed of a corrosion resistant alloy such as an alloy of<br>
nickel and chromium or they can be formed of a ceramic wear resistant material such<br>
as alumina, silicon carbide or the like. Also, the vanes can be hollow so that the<br>
cooling medium will keep them cooler, heat transfer will be increased and pigment<br>
deposits will be reduced.<br>
The improved process of this invention for producing and cooling participate<br>
solid titanium dioxide is comprised of the following steps. Heated gaseous titanium<br>
tetrachloridc and heated oxygen are reacted at a high temperature, that is, a<br>
temperature of at least 1200 degrees Celsius (2200°F), to produce particulate soiid<br>
titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction products. The titanium dioxide and gaseous<br>
reaction products are cooled by passing them through an elongated tubular heat<br>
exchanger along with a scouring medium for removing deposits from the inside<br>
surfaces of the heat exchanger. The scouring medium and the paniculate titanium<br>
dioxide and gaseous reaction products are caused to follow a spiral path as they flow<br>
through the elongated tubular heat exchanger. In accordance with the presently<br>
preferred process embodiment, the particulate titanium dioxidp and gaseous reaction<br>
products are caused to follow the spiral path by providing one or more spiraling vanes<br>
on the inside surfaces of all or spaced portions of the elongated tubular heat<br>
exchanger.<br>
A more specific process of the present invention for producing paniculate<br>
solid titanium dioxide comprises the steps of: (a) reacting gaseous titanium<br>
tetrachloride and oxygen at a temperature in the range of at least about 1200 degrees<br>
Celsius (2200°F) to produce paniculate solid titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction<br>
products; (b) cooling the produced paniculate solid titanium dioxide and gaseous<br>
reaction products with a cooling medium in a tubular heat exchanger to a temperature<br>
about 700 degrees Celsius (1300°F) or less; (c) injecting a scouring medium into the<br>
heat exchanger for removing deposits from the inside surfaces thereof; (d) causing the<br>
scouring medium to follow a spiral path through the heat exchanger ; and<br>
(c) separating the participate solid titanium dioxide from the scouring medium and the<br>
gaseous reaction products.<br>
In order to further illustrate the improved process and apparatus of the present<br>
invention, the following example is given.<br>
Example<br>
A series of tests were performed to increase the efficiency of an elongated<br>
tubular heat exchanger used for cooling the titanium dioxide and gaseous reaction<br>
products produced in the chloride process. The heat exchanger was instrumented to<br>
determine the effectiveness of heat transfer and consisted of a number of sections of<br>
water jacketed pipe. Cooling water flowed through the jacket and reaction products<br>
from the reactor consisting of a mixture of Cl2, TiO2 pigment, and 5 to 10 percent O2<br>
flowed through the interior of the pipe. The heat exchanger sections were about 4.9<br>
meters (16 feet) long and were connected together by flanges. An external water pipe<br>
called a jumper connected the water jacket of one section to the water jacket of the<br>
adjacent section. A thermocouple was placed in each jumper and total water flow<br>
through the heat exchanger sections was measured at the inlet to the sections. The<br>
amount of heat that was transferred from the reaction products stream to the water in<br>
each heat exchanger section was determined from the difference in temperature<br>
between the water inlet and outlet and the water flow rate. The gas temperature for<br>
the heat exchanger sections was calculated from a mass balance for the reactor, the<br>
amount of heat fed to the reactor with the reactant feed streams and the total heat lost<br>
from the reactor upstream of the sections. A heat transfer coefficient was calculated<br>
for each heat exchanger section from the temperature of the product stream and the<br>
amount of heat that.was transferred to the cooling water in that section.<br>
The calculated heat transfer coefficients were then compared to the heat<br>
transfer coefficients calculated from empirical heat transfer correlations available in<br>
the open literature for paniculate free gases. It was anticipated that the correlations<br>
for paniculate loaded gases would be different than for clean gases, but it seemed<br>
probable that there would be a relatively constant ratio between the coefficient<br>
measured for the heat exchanger sections and the coefficients calculated for clean gas.<br>
The results indicated that the deviation between the values calculated from empirical<br>
correlations and those determined experimentally were much greater for the sections<br>
near the exit of the elongated heat exchanger than for those at the inlet, it seemed<br>
likely that the difference could be due to deposits in the sections. Tests were then<br>
initiated to develop methods for improving heat transfer near the exit of the elongated<br>
heat exchanger. The tests were performed using the last 8 sections of the elongated<br>
heat exchanger. All of the sections were 18 centimeters (7-inches) in diameter and<br>
approximately 4.9 meters (16-feet) in length, except for the last section which was an<br>
adapter for attaching the elongated heat exchanger to the product collection section.<br>
The adapter section was 1,2 meters (4-fect) in length and slightly larger in diameter<br>
than the other sections. The results of all of the tests are given in the Table below.<br>
Test 1<br>
A control test was performed using silica sand as the scouring medium. The<br>
product rate for the reactor was set at a level that could be maintained even if heat<br>
transfer rates were to change significantly. The ratios of the measured heat transfer<br>
coefficients to theoretical heat transfer coefficients were determined. The results<br>
indicate that the difference between the actual coefficients and the theoretical<br>
coefficients increases as the gases move down the elongated heat exchanger.<br>
Test 2<br>
In the second test, a device was placed in the middle of a heat exchanger<br>
section to introduce N2 tangentially into the section to cause the scouring medium to<br>
follow a spiral path downstream of the nitrogen addition point. The reactor produced<br>
TiO2 pigment at a rate of about 59 to 68 kg (130 to 150 pounds) per minute.<br>
Approximately 5700 standard liters (200 standard cubic feet) of N2 was introduced<br>
into the section over a period of several minutes. The result was that the heat transfer<br>
improved measurably over the entire product cooler downstream of the point of<br>
injection. Without being limiting of the present invention, the increase in heat<br>
transfer is attributed principally to more efficient scouring rather than increased<br>
turbulence. Support for this conclusion was found first in that the increase in heat<br>
transfer was observed as far as 100 section diameters downstream from the point of<br>
N2 injection. Calculations and published data indicated that any increase in heat<br>
transfer due to turbulence decreases rapidly and disappears completely within about<br>
20 pipe diameters downstream1.2. Additional support for the conclusion was found in<br>
that the increase in heat transfer was observed to continue for some time after the N2<br>
flow had been stopped.<br>
Test 3<br>
A scouring medium of TiO2 was prepared by agglomerating unfinished<br>
pigment, heat treating the material to produce a suitably hard material and then<br>
screening the material to provide a particle size distribution similar to that of the silica<br>
sand that had been used. The TiO2 scouring medium was fed at the front of the<br>
reactor. The results of this test were similar to the results of Test 1.<br>
Test 2<br>
A heat exchanger section having spiraling vanes and recesses as shown in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 was installed in place of heat exchanger section No. 6, The portion of<br>
the heat exchanger section which included the spiraling vanes and recesses was the<br>
first 2.4 meters (8 feet) of the section. The scouring medium was the same as used in<br>
Test 3, and the product rate was approximately the same as in Tests 1 and 3. The<br>
results indicate that the average heat transfer coefficient for section No. 7 immediately<br>
downstream of section No. 6 was significantly higher than the average heat transfer<br>
coefficient for section No. 7 in Test 3. The average heat transfer coefficient for<br>
section No. 8 that was 9.8 meters (32 feet) or 55 pipe diameters from the end of the<br>
spiraling vanes and recesses was slightly higher than the average heat transfer<br>
coefficient for section No. 8 in Test 3.<br>
Test 5<br>
The heat exchanger section including the spiraling vanes and recesses was<br>
installed in place of section No. 11 and a test similar to Test 4 was performed. The<br>
results indicate that a significant improvement was obtained even for section No. 13<br>
that was 7.9 meters (26 feet) or more than 47 pipe diameters from the end of section<br>
No. 11.<br>
Additional Tests<br>
A test similar to Test 5 was performed using ceramic spiraling vanes (which<br>
may be advantageously used where excessive wear or chemical attack might be<br>
expected). The heat transfer results for sections No. 12 and No. 13 with the ceramic<br>
vanes were the same as for Test No. 5. The heat transfer within the section containing<br>
the vanes was dependent on the conductivity of the material used for the vanes and<br>
the design of the vanes. In another set of tests, the temperature of the gases exiting<br>
the bag filter was determined when the heat exchanger was operated without spiraling<br>
vanes. Vanes were then installed in place of section No. 11 and the production rate<br>
increased until the temperature of the gases exiting the bag filters had reached (hat<br>
same temperature. The results were that without the vanes, a production rate of 97<br>
tons per day resulted in an exit temperature of 187 degrees Celsius (369°P), whereas<br>
with the vanes, a production rate of 119 tons per day (a 23 percent increase in<br>
productivity) could be achieved with an exit temperature of 184 degrees Celsius<br>
(363°F). "INCONEL™" vanes were operated for over 30 hours. No measurable<br>
wear was found on the vanes and raw pigment quality was excellent. No deposits<br>
were found on the vanes.The results of the tests confirm that the spiraling vanes and<br>
recesses increase the effectiveness of the scouring medium. References:<br>
