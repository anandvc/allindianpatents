AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS BASED<br>
SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND A METHOD THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[1]	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application Nos. 60/365,820, 60/378,805, and 60/411,435 filed on March 19, 2002, May<br>
7,2002, and September 16, 2002, respectively, which applications are incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[2]	The present invention pertains generally to the field of location-based<br>
information systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[3]	Advances in telecommunications technology have enabled faster and more<br>
accurate location of users carrying mobile devices. Examples of such technology are<br>
described in United States Patent Nos. 6,477,362 and 6,477,379, both issued on<br>
November 5, 2002, which patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety,<br>
These patents respectively describe systems for directing emergency services to a user<br>
based on her or his location and for locating a mobile device with the aid of two base<br>
stations.<br>
[4]	Global Positioning Systems (GPS) receivers are described in several<br>
publications and references, such as the United States Patent No. 5,528,248, issued on<br>
June 18,1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This<br>
patent discloses a personal Digital Location Assistant based on a GPS Smart Antenna and<br>
a computing device.<br>
[5]	GPS utilizes signals transmitted by a number of in-view satellites to<br>
determine the location of a GPS antenna which is connected to a receiver. Each GPS<br>
satellite transmits two coded L-band carrier signals which enable some compensation for<br>
propagation delays through the ionosphere. Each GPS receiver contains an almanac of<br>
data describing the satellite orbits and uses ephemeris corrections transmitted by the<br>
satellites themselves. Satellite to antenna distances may be deduced from time code or<br>
carrier phase differences determined by comparing the received signals with locally<br>
generated receiver signals. These distances are then used to determine antenna position.<br><br><br>
Only those satellites which are sufficiently above the horizon can contribute to a position<br>
measurement, the accuracy of which depends on various factors including the geometrical<br>
arrangement of the satellites at the time when the distances are determined.<br>
[6]	Distances measured from an antenna to four or more satellites enable the<br>
antenna position to be calculated with reference to the global ellipsoid WGS-84. Local<br>
northing, easting and elevation coordinates can then be determined by applying<br>
appropriate datum transformation and map projection. By using carrier phase differences<br>
in any one of several known techniques, the antenna location can be determined to an<br>
accuracy on the order of .+-.1 cm.<br>
[7]	Locations may be specified by various means, both actual and<br>
representational, including geocodes, centroids, and street vectors/segments. These and<br>
other terms are used by various technologies to provide systems and methods for<br>
delivering spatially-dependent services.<br>
[8]	A geocode is a specification of a position using a suitable coordinate system<br>
and at a granularity that is sufficient for a particular application. For example, a geocode<br>
specifying a latitude and a longitude specifies a position on the surface of the earth. A<br>
geocode may also specify a height above the surface of the earth. A geocqde<br>
encompasses providing spatial information in a form other than specifying the longitude<br>
and the latitude. Other examples of geocodes include postal centroids that are associated<br>
with areas sharing a common zip code. A centroid is a geographic center of an entire<br>
area, region, boundary, etc. for which the specific geographic area covers. A familiar<br>
example is the association between a centroid and a postal code, such as the ZIP codes<br>
defined and used by the United States Postal Service.<br>
[9]	Street vectors are address ranges assigned to segments of individual streets.<br>
Street vectors assist in displaying digitized computer-based street maps. Often, street<br>
vectors appear as left and right side address ranges, and may be also used for geocoding a<br>
particular address to a particular street segment.<br>
[10]	Geocoding is described in United States Patent No. 6,101,496 issued on<br>
August 8,2000, and assigned to the assignee of the present application, which patent is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the context of spatially meaningful<br>
databases, geocoding is the act, method or process of assigning x and y coordinates<br><br><br>
(usually but not limited to latitude and longitude) to records, lists and files containing<br>
location information (full addresses, partial addresses, zip codes, census FIPS codes, etc.)<br>
for cartographic or any other form of spatial analysis or reference. Geocoding<br>
encompasses assigning spatial parameters to data to visualize information and exploring<br>
relationships based on spatial distribution. Some examples include census data or survey<br>
data that identify the residences of individuals with a particular income bracket, ethnicity,<br>
political affiliations, employment, and the like.<br>
[11]	Geocoding is often performed by running ungeocoded (referred to hereafter<br>
as "raw data") information such as a list of customers through software and/or data which<br>
performs table lookup, fuzzy logic and address matching against an entire "library" of all<br>
known or available addresses (referred to hereafter as "georeferenced library") with<br>
associated x,y location coordinates.<br>
[12]	A georeferenced library may be compiled from a number of varied sources<br>
including US Census address information and US postal address information, along with<br>
Zip Code boundaries and other various sources of data containing geographic information<br>
and/or location geometry. If a raw data address cannot be matched exactly to a specific<br>
library street address (known as a "street level hit"), then an attempt may be made to<br>
match the raw data address to geographic hierarchy of point, line or region geography of<br>
ever decreasing precision until a predetermined tolerance for an acceptable match is met.<br>
The geographic hierarchy to which a raw data record is finally assigned is also known as<br>
the "geocoding precision." Geocoding precision tells how closely the location assigned<br>
by the geocoding software matches the true location of the raw data. Geocoding<br>
technology generally provides for two main types of precision: street level and postal ZIP<br>
centroid. Street level precision is the placement of geocoded records at the street address.<br>
Street level precision attempts to geocode all records to the actual street address. In all<br>
likelihood, some matches may end up at a less precise location such as a ZIP centroid<br>
(ZIP+4, ZIP+2, or ZIP code) or shape path (the shape of a street as defined by points that<br>
make up each segment of the street.<br>
[13]	One form of spatial indexing for storing and accessing location sensitive<br>
information in databases is disclosed by United States Patent No. 6,363,392 issued on<br>
March 26,2002, which is hereby incorporated by reference it its entirety. This patent<br>
uses quad keys to provide a flexible, web-sharable database with proximity searching<br><br><br>
capability. The process for generating quad keys begins with geocoding where a<br>
description of a geographic location is converted into a longitude and latitude, which may<br>
be represented as integers at some resolution. Then, a quad key is generated in binary<br>
form, with the bits interleaved (most significant bit (MSB) from x, followed by MSB<br>
from y, followed by next-MSB from x, next-MSB from y, etc.).<br>
[14]	Various technologies for providing location information include triangulation<br>
using radio signals, global positioning systems ("GPS"), and other technologies described<br>
in United States Patent Nos. 5,528,248 and 6,477,379. United States Patent Application<br>
No. 10/159,195 filed on May 31,2002 discloses a method and system for obtaining<br>
geocodes corresponding to addresses and addresses corresponding to geocodes. This<br>
application claims the benefit of the disclosure and filing date of United States<br>
Provisional Patent Application No. 60/256,103 filed on May 31,2001. These patent<br>
applications are also incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These'and other<br>
means for determining position, including those developed subsequent to this invention,<br>
may be used to provide location information.<br>
[15]	In another aspect, it should be noted that the term "interface" is commonly<br>
used in describing software and devices. For clarity, as used herein the term "interface"<br>
differs from a "user interface" in that a user interface is a presentation made to a user<br>
offering various choices, information, and operable elements such as buttons, knobs, and<br>
the like. A user interface may include physical components as well as transient displayed<br>
information. An interface, in contrast, in the context of object oriented ("OO") languages<br>
represents methods that are supported either by the interface itself in some OO languages,<br>
or provided in the interface as abstract methods which are provided by classes<br>
implementing the interface. A familiar example of the latter kind of OO paradigms is<br>
JAVA, which allows platform independent coding of software.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[16]	A method and system are disclosed for providing extensible or stand-alone<br>
location enabled services. The disclosed method and system provide services that may<br>
also utilize the internet using an extensible Markup Language Application Interface<br>
(XML-API). These services enable a collection of applications to manage information<br>
specific to mobile locations, provide services, including real-time services, with complete<br>
or partial integration via a common service manager. Preferably, the XML-API forms a<br><br><br>
platform that ties together the key services commonly used in the development of these<br>
mobile location applications.<br>
[17]	In the context of cellular networks and their integration into web-based<br>
communication, mobile location is integrated with other location sensitive data, such as<br>
maps or demographics of a particular region or the location of businesses and consumers<br>
to enable a richer service offering for customers of wireless carriers and service providers.<br><br>
[18]	Examples of such services may include obtaining one or more routes between<br>
a starting point and a destination; providing a geocode corresponding to an address;<br>
providing an address corresponding to a geocode; providing maps as image files<br>
encompassing specified geocodes, locations, or addresses; obtaining a position for a<br>
mobile device; obtaining the identity of a location; obtaining one or more geographic<br>
features near a location; managing person profile data; providing a map corresponding to<br>
a location; providing a coordinate geometry service for carrying out geometric<br>
calculations and measurements; performing coordinate transformations; providing traffic<br>
related information; generating enterprise specific maps; and providing an enterprise<br>
profile.<br>
[19]	Additional services may be added to the disclosed system and method.<br>
Moreover, although the illustrative embodiments disclose integration of the various<br>
services, they may be offered at various levels of granularity down to offering stand-alone<br>
services or any combination of services.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[45]	A method and system for providing one or more location-based services with<br>
the aid of a markup language based interface with one or more service managers and<br>
access to one or more databases is disclosed. The method and system are typically, but<br>
not as a requirement for practicing the invention, implemented via at least one server,<br>
possibly in the form of a servlet, and a database that in combination with specified<br>
location information, enables delivery of customized services, options, and offers to<br><br><br>
customers. The method and system extend the advances made in determination of<br>
location of mobile users to offer customized location-based services. In addition, these<br>
services also integrate, when desirable, demographic data to generate services suited to<br>
various demographic segments and markets. Such demographic data includes user<br>
preferences, geographical distribution of users, mobility patterns and the like. These and<br>
other applications, including stand alone and integrated implementations, are described by<br>
way of the following examples and exemplary embodiments, starting with a description<br>
of an integrated implementation that allows one or more location-based services to be<br>
offered to users.<br>
AN INTEGRATED LOCATION-BASED SERVICE PLATFORM<br>
[46]	The method and system of the present invention leverage wired and/or<br>
wireless connectivity, including that over the Internet, to provide services of interest to<br>
consumers. A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes providing an<br>
integrated location-based service platform, an example of which is the miAware™ set of<br>
services provided by the Maplnfo® Corporation of Troy, NY as part of its Mobile<br>
Location Services (MLS). miAware™ includes an XML based API that enables both<br>
implementation and efficient communication of various requests and responses as<br>
described at, milocate.mapmfo.com/miAware/, a copy of which, dated March 19,2003,<br>
is attached as APPENDIX to this application.<br>
[47]	An integrated location-based service platform is also described in the United<br>
States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/365,820 filed on March 19,2002, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[48]	Such an integrated location-based service platform, for instance, the<br>
miAware™, provided by the Maplnfo® Corporation of Troy, NY, provides numerous<br>
services and facilities including providing a route to a target, finding a nearest specified<br>
type of target, geocoding, geodecoding, and determining a mobile position service for a<br>
person with a mobile device such as a GPS or cell phone and the like. These services are<br>
accessed via user interfaces and underlying XML APIs.<br>
[49]	FIGURE 1 illustrates a typical context for providing an integrated location-<br>
based service platform. Users 100, including mobile users, access via antenna 105<br><br><br>
gateway 110 and location server 115. Location server 115 may further connect to the<br>
Internet 120 or to portal platform 125 to provide an integrated location-based service<br>
platform.<br>
[50]	FIGURE 2 illustrates a schematic representation of an integrated location-<br>
based service platform. Client requests 200 are directed to service manager 205, which is<br>
in contact with a service catalogue 210 containing a description of various services<br>
available via service manager 205. The service catalogue is preferably in the form of<br>
document-type definitions ("DTD") or a schema (e.g., specified under the OpenLS<br>
standard), or any other suitable format specifying the form of requests and responses for<br>
obtaining a particular service. This enables a client request to be formatted for proper<br>
parsing and processing. Typically requests are sent encoded in a markup language such<br>
as XML. Such use of a markup language allows a large number of interfaces to be<br>
provided to a variety of services at a common portal, service manager 205. Preferably,<br>
communications by various services 215, as part of service provider level 220, with<br>
service manager 205 are also encoded in a markup language in accordance with a DTD<br>
specification that requires support for resource management and methods for starting and<br>
terminating a particular module with support for multi-threading. This enables a service<br>
to register itself with service manager 205 and publish itself to service catalogue 225,<br>
where it may be discovered, along with the syntax for service requests directed to the<br>
service, by client requests directed to the service catalogue 225. This architecture makes<br>
the integrated location-based service platform flexible since various different services<br>
may be added or removed from the integrated location-based service platform to provide<br>
customized services. With the ease of adding new services or terminating existing<br>
services, the integrated location-based service platform provides a common platform for<br>
accessing a variety of location-based services. It should be noted that many of the<br>
services accessed through service manger 205 may also be provided as stand alone<br>
services, possibly concurrently with providing access via service manager 205.<br>
[51]	FIGURE 3 provides an illustration of various interactions at a service<br>
manager in the course of providing services via an integrated location-based service<br>
platform. Service request 305 elicits service response 310 to client 300. Advantageously,<br>
service request 305 and response 310 may be transmitted via a network, such as Internet<br>
315, to service manager 320. Service manager 320 has integrated location-based service<br><br><br>
platform configuration information 325, as well as information about the various<br>
available services in service catalogue 330. In response to receiving service request 305,<br>
service manager 320 generates service object 335, which is directed to service provider<br>
interface 340 specified in service request 305. Service response object 345 generated by<br>
the service provider via service provider interface 340 is sent to service manager 320,<br>
which in turn, generates service response 310 directed to client 300.<br>
[52]	FIGURE 4 illustrates an integrated location-based service platform along<br>
with various service provider modules, spatial servers accessed by the service provider<br>
modules, third party servers and data repositories used to respond to service requests.<br>
Request 400 from client 405 is received at integrated location-based service platform<br>
server 410 via service provider interface 415. Service provider interface 415 directs<br>
request 400 to one of service modules providing services for positioning 420, coordinate<br>
system transformation 425, position refinement 430, finding location 435, geodecoding<br>
440, profiling 445, geocoding 450, Cogo 455 (coordinate geometry service), finding<br>
nearest geographical of interest 460, mapping 465, routing 470, and administration 475.<br>
As illustrated, although not as a requirement for practicing the invention, service modules<br>
position refinement 430, finding location 435, geodecoding 440, finding nearest<br>
geographical of interest 460, and mapping 465 communicate with spatial server 480,<br>
which may be a MapXtreme® Server provided by Maplnfo® Corporation, accessing in<br>
turn relational database 482. Similarly, routing 470 accesses routing server 485 while<br>
geocoding 450 accesses spatial server 490, which may be a MapMarker® Server provided<br>
by Maplnfo® Corporation. In addition, modules for profiling 445 access third party<br>
directory server 492, which, in turn, accesses LDAP 494, while positioning 420 accesses<br>
third party location server 496. The result sent by one or more of the various service<br>
modules is used to generate response 498 to request 400. Thus, response 498 may<br>
integrate information from more than one service module.<br>
[53]	In one aspect the present invention encompasses a system including: a routing<br>
module that receives and routes requests to an appropriate response module; a plurality of<br>
response modules registered with the routing module for responding to different types of<br>
requests; a plurality of spatial servers from which the response modules retrieve spatial<br>
information to be used in responding to the requests; and an interface for adding response<br>
modules to the system. The interface further includes methods for publication of<br><br><br>
information regarding the response module to the service manager, also referred to as the<br>
routing module, including information required for starting or terminating a particular<br>
response module, and methods to allocate or deallocate resources.<br>
[54]	The system of the present invention further encompasses: a servlet within a<br>
platform independent implementation (JAVA). The servlet is in communication with a<br>
service catalog to determine or update available services/response modules and a user<br>
profile and geographic database. The servlet also provides support for one or more of<br>
HTTP/POST, XML, and SOAP, while being adapted to forward requests to a registered<br>
response module, which module, in turn, receives spatial information from a spatial<br>
server, and sends results to the routing manager for generation of the response to the<br>
request.<br>
[55]	The system of the present invention also encompasses the functionality of a<br>
response sent to a different address than the address from which the request was received.<br>
[56] The system of the present invention further encompasses a plurality of spatial<br>
servers that may include one or more of: a routing server (Routing J Server™) for<br>
obtaining one or more routes between a starting point and a destination; a geocoding<br>
server (e.g., MapMarker J Server™) for providing geocodes corresponding to an address;<br>
a geodecoding server (e.g., MapMarker J Server™) for providing an address<br>
corresponding to a geocode; and a mapping server (MapXtreme server™) for providing<br>
maps as image files encompassing specified geocodes, locations, or addresses.<br>
[57]	The system of the present invention also encompasses at least one service<br>
module comprising: an interface for receiving a request; an interface for generating a<br>
response to the request; and an interface for initializing and shutting down the service<br>
module.<br>
[58]	Embodiments of the system of the present invention may also encompass<br>
services such as obtaining one or more records containing a geocode corresponding to an<br>
address; obtaining an address corresponding to a geocode; obtaining a route to a<br>
destination; obtaining a position for a mobile device; obtaining the identity of a location;<br>
obtaining one or more geographic features near a location; and a person profile data;<br>
providing a map corresponding to a location; a coordinate geometry service for carrying<br>
out geometric calculations and measurements; performing coordinate transformations;<br><br><br>
providing traffic related information; generating enterprise specific maps; and providing<br>
an enterprise profile.<br>
[59]	Embodiments of the system of the present invention may also encompass<br>
Pass-Thru Service, which refers to a service provider creating a service request<br>
specification that contains a request of another service or server (typically encoded in<br>
XML as well). The Pass-Thru Service facility extracts a request content (or payload)<br>
from the request document in the original request envelope, passes this payload to another<br>
server (third-party server) that accepts the XML request, processes the payload, and<br>
wraps the response payload back into an envelope for returning the response document.<br>
Thus, the integrated location-based service platform, or its modules, may not only receive<br>
requests, it may also make requests and process the response thereto.<br>
[60]	FIGURE 5 illustrates an example of an integrated location-based service<br>
platform for providing routing information in London, U.K. The integrated location-<br>
based service platform preferably comprises service manager 500, which receives<br>
requests 502 from user 504. User 504 may request a route that could include walking,<br>
driving and subway legs for providing the lowest cost, shortest distance, and/or shortest<br>
time or other specifications. Alternatively, a default specification may be provided to the<br>
user. User 504 sends request 502 via interface 506, which allows additional requests to<br>
be sent as well. Interface 506 is extensible and includes tube (i.e., subway) interface 508<br>
for communicating with tube service 510 underlying service manager 500. Extensibility<br>
denotes providing interfaces to allow anyone including third parties to extend the<br>
functionality of the system. Thus if a subway routing module for a city was available, it<br>
may be added without the need for express integration for incorporating the functionality<br>
directly into the routing modules. It is preferred that such modules are registered only<br>
following an authentication or a limited gate-keeping step to ensure that the module<br>
provider is trusted, as well as retain a measure of control over potential providers of<br>
service modules. To the user, the added functionality appears seamlessly integrated.<br>
[61]	Service manager 500 sends a request object 512 to tube schedule service 514,<br>
which is part of service providers 516. Tube schedule service 514 requests information<br>
from tube map server 518, which is one of the spatial servers 520, and receives<br>
information 522 in response thereto. This information enables service provider modules<br>
516, such as tube schedule service 514 to generate response object 524 for service<br><br><br>
manager 500 in response to processing request 502. Service manager 500, in turn,<br>
generates response document 526 for sending to user 504 via interface 506.<br>
[62]	Notably, FIGURE 5 also illustrates that service providers 516 (response<br>
modules) may provide various services that may have security components as well. For<br>
instance, a service provider providing security or personal profile information may<br>
provide permissions that enable all users to (1) access one or more of all applications; (2)<br>
access some services by way of some applications only, (3) allow specified user to access<br>
specified services; or (4) characterize the profile of an enterprise.<br>
[63]	In addition, the wireless carrier may provide additional services through<br>
intuitive and automated interfaces that allow a user to advertise event such as a garage<br>
sale. This service is enhanced in value by the smooth integration of the functionality for<br>
providing directions from existing modules integrated via the with directions to the<br>
garage sale generated in a customized fashion for individual users, such as user 504,<br>
based on use of the tube, walking and/or driving. User 504 may be provided infonnation,<br><br>
for instance that regarding the garage sale, in response to detecting user 504 via<br>
LAN/WiFi 530. Such detection triggers, preferably with the consent of the user, the<br>
obtaining of profile and preference information for user 504 over a secure Wide Area<br>
Network (WAN) 540. In addition, user 504 may be presented with a choice of or<br>
infonnation about malls and supplier stores 550 in the vicinity, along with directions to a<br>
supplier store from a location of user 504. All of these activities are preferably carried<br>
out automatically, thus integrating user 504 with the surroundings.<br>
[64]	Thus, the choice of mall stores, as is also further illustrated in FIGURE 6,<br>
may be provided by a wireless carrier along with information about a garage sale in the<br>
vicinity. Notably, WiFi is not necessary for accessing information about a garage sale or<br>
a store in a shopping mall. Such information could be provided by way of local data<br>
going back through the carrier to the device being carried by the end user. The<br>
connection is still preferably point-to-point in the sense that a handoffrequest is given to<br>
the system(s) to hold the mall information even if the mall returns it back to the carrier for<br>
delivery rather than delivering it directly. Garage sale advertising functionality may<br>
interact with a carrier in a similar way.<br><br>
[65]	The wireless provider (or some other agent) brokers an arrangement with a<br>
person wishing to hold a garage sale and the person wishing to have the garage sale (or<br>
any other similar activity) provides the details for the garage sale by interacting through<br>
an interface managed by the carrier or other agent without any need for direct intervention<br>
by the carrier or other agent. In some embodiments there may not even be a charge for<br>
such a service, but likely there will be a charge if that matters. The party advertising the<br>
garage sale provides an address for where the garage sale is being held, the carrier or<br>
other agent knows the location of the sale and can therefore provide the end user wishing<br>
to know about any sales in the vicinity of the end user. The actual details about the<br>
selected sales are then delivered preferably in response to a user request.<br>
[66]	WiFi functionality is likely to be used if a user were looking for a sale rather<br>
than push sales related information to a user. Preferably, mobile users, for instance,<br>
moving in a vehicle or walking through a neighbourhood, are sensed via carrier detection<br>
and interaction. Thus, the provider of the 'sale' or any event in general may provide<br>
advertisement and notice of the event along with directions and other sophisticated<br>
functions without the need of any programmer by merely using a friendly user-interface<br>
to guide them through the setting up of such a service to make their local event detectable<br>
through the carrier or other agent.<br><br>
[67]	In another aspect, the present invention comprises stand-alone services that<br>
may be provided by stand-alone service providers or by service providers that may be<br>
accessed both through an integrated location-based service platform and directly. An<br>
example is provided by a peer-to-peer location-based information system (LBS) in which<br>
locally relevant information may be maintained by local entities, such as local businesses.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention comprises a combination of location-based<br>
service and personalization, in which locally- and personally-relevant information is<br>
automatically provided to users based on their location and previously-stored<br>
personalization information. In a preferred embodiment, the peer-to-peer aspect and the<br>
personalized localization aspects are combined into a single system. In one such<br>
preferred embodiment, a central server maintains personalization information in the form<br>
of a customer profile, and maintains a list of servers providing locally relevant<br>
information, and automatically refers the user to a server providing information relevant<br>
to the user's location. The profile is used to refer the user only to information that<br><br><br>
matches the user's profile, and/or to provide the server providing locally relevant<br>
information with the ability to personalize the information for the user.<br>
[68]	In a preferred embodiment, the present system and method comprise a site<br>
adapted to host one or more location-based services. A Service Provider Java API is<br>
preferably provided, which is a set of Java interfaces and classes for development of new<br>
services. New services can be deployed to the existing set of services hosted by a the site.<br>
Once deployed, services may be accessed from the outside world.<br>
[69]	In order to deploy a new service, a service provider preferably implements<br>
three main interfaces: ServiceProvider, ServiceRequest, and ServiceResponse.<br>
ServiceProvider is the main interface to a provider. At initialisation, a ServiceProperties<br>
object is passed into the provider so configuration information specified in the Service<br>
Catalog can be utilized. Since initialisation is only a one time operation, global<br>
information necessary for performing service requests in a multi-threaded environment<br>
should be cached. At shutdown, the provider preferably de-allocates resources so to<br>
avoid memory leakage and/or holding up unnecessary resources (e.g. database<br>
connections). These tasks are performed by methods such as init(), shutdown(),<br>
getServiceRequest(), and perform(). The ServiceRequest contains parsed information of<br>
a request document. The provider creates the ServiceRequest object based on the input<br>
request document. This object parses the content of the document and provides<br>
information for rendering a request. The ServiceRequest is passed into the provider at a<br>
later stage for carrying out the service request. Implementation of this interface also<br>
provides capability to create request document conformaning to a suitable DTD, such as<br>
the miAwareServiceRequest DTD, which includes specifications for methods (e.g.<br>
setDistanceUni() of the RouteRequest object) that are available for filling the content of<br>
this document including setters &amp; getters toXMLdocument().<br>
[70]	A ServiceResponse obj ect contains results of a service request and is returned<br>
after a service is rendered. This object also provides methods for publishing its content to<br>
a XML document conforming to the miAwareServiceResponse DTD. In addition, this<br>
object is also able to parse its own response XML document and provides "get" methods<br>
(e.g. getTotalTimeO of the RouteResponseO object) for retrieving the content.<br><br><br>
[71]	If other third-party JAR files are required, they are also bundled together with<br>
the implementation class(es) of the ServiceProvider interface. The request and response<br>
DTDs, their sample XML documents, and Javadoc for the ServiceRequest and<br>
ServiceResponse implementation classes are also made available.<br>
[72]	In another aspect, a client Java API is provided, which comprises a set of<br>
helper classes grouped by services, which assist Java application developers to publish<br>
service requests and retrieve information from a response document. Helper classes<br>
which assist development of client applications include constructing service requests as<br>
XML (e.g., String req = routeReq.toXMLDocument();), submitting requests to<br>
miAware™ Service Manager (e.g., InputStream is = miAwareConn.submit(req);), and<br>
parsing results from service response XML (e.g., RouteResponse res=New<br>
RouteResponse(is);). The client is super thin due to no dependency on core software.<br>
Typically, the client needs W3C compliant SAX/DOM parsers (which are provided by<br>
many entities such as Sun®, Oracle®, IBM®, etc).<br>
[73]	Turning to the form of response and request specifications, some useful<br>
features are readily apparent. These messages are encoded in a markup language, and<br>
include a location of interest and a plurality of nested tags, preferably conforming to the<br>
XML specification, such that the message comprising an outer tag indicates a first<br>
service. The inner tag is associated with a plurality of attributes for processing the<br>
request so that at a user interface (supported in a thin client) one or more fields<br>
corresponding to the plurality of attributes are presented to receive data for providing the<br>
first service or the result of a service request. The location of interest may be provided by<br>
many different means, such as user input, a base station location signal, an address, a<br>
geocode, two or more base station signals detected by a mobile phone, and two or more<br>
GPS signals. As noted previously, a part of the request is forwarded to a service provider<br>
module by using the nested tag structure.<br>
[74]	In another aspect, the tags correspond to requests for services such as routes<br>
to a specified destination, a list of local servers for obtaining local information, an ordered<br>
list of events, a list of products or services, a location, a map, a list of nearest<br>
geographical features, transformed coordinates, an event matching service, a traffic<br>
monitoring service, a peer-to-peer communication shopping service, a user profile<br>
service, and a location aware service. The attributes provide data for an address,<br><br><br>
authenticating information, personal preference information, event description, a route,<br>
geographically accessible locations, product description, traffic conditions, weather<br>
conditions, a map, and coordinates transformation.<br>
[75]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a central LBS server in the peer-<br>
to-peer system maintains a database of local-content servers (peers) providing locally<br>
relevant information that is spatially indexed so as to permit the network addresses of the<br>
local-content servers to be resolved based on a provided indication of the location of a<br>
user. Such a database may include records indicating categories of content available from<br>
at least a portion of the servers.<br>
[76]	When a user of a mobile device accesses the system of the present invention<br>
by running a client program for interacting with the LBS server, the LBS server is<br>
provided with an indication of the user's geographic location. The client system may<br>
comprise a cellular telephone comprising a location determination system such as GPS or<br>
any mobile positioning technology, and Java. Using the indication of the user's<br>
geographic location, the LBS server queries the database for local-content servers<br>
providing information or services relevant to the area of the user's geographic location. If<br>
the results include only one local-content server, the user is preferably re-directed to the<br>
local-content server. If the results include more than one local-content server, the user is<br>
preferably provided with a list of links to local-content servers.<br>
[77]	The LBS server may not include information about the content or services<br>
provided by the local-content servers, thus avoiding the need for updates when the<br>
content or services provided by local-content servers are updated. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the LBS server database includes records indicating the categories of<br>
content or services provided by at least a portion of the local-content servers.<br>
[78]	The information and/or services provided by local-content servers are<br>
preferably maintained by entities, such as businesses, that also provide goods and/or<br>
services through facilities physically located near the geographic locations for which the<br>
local-content servers provide information and/or services. There is no requirement for the<br>
local-content servers to be physically located in or near geographic areas for which the<br>
local-content servers provide information and/or services. However, in one preferred<br>
?mbodiment, local-content servers are maintained locally by area organizations, such as<br><br><br>
shopping malls, and may be accessed by local-content providers, such as stores within the<br>
shopping mall. Preferably, wireless access is provided for maintenance by local-content<br>
providers.<br>
[79]	Personalization services may be provided by the LBS server, or by the local-<br>
content servers, or both. In a preferred embodiment, personalization services are<br>
provided by local-content servers, which act upon information provided from a customer<br>
profile maintained by the LBS server operator. In this way, only personally relevant local<br>
content is provided to the user. Personalization services are preferably provided by<br>
Maplnfo® Corporation's miAware™ profile module. Servers running MapInfo®'s<br>
miAware™ also preferably provide LBS services and local-content services.<br>
[80]	An illustrative embodiment of the present invention includes a<br>
communication system comprising a central LBS server, a plurality of local-content<br>
servers called, a central database (repository) attached to the central LBS server<br>
containing one or more URL of each local-content server, a plurality of local-content<br>
databases (repositories) attached to each local-content server, and a map server. Each<br>
local-content database preferably comprises product and sales information of stores in a<br>
shopping mall. Each central LBS server and local-content server may, for instance, be<br>
implemented as an Apache Tomcat web server with Java Servlets with the databases or<br>
repository being an Oracle database accessed by Servlets via JDBC. An example map<br>
server preferably comprises Maplnfo® Corporation®'s MapXtremeJava™ 3.1 servlet for<br>
retrieving maps for specific local malls, as shown in FIGURE 6. Collaborations of these<br>
system components are shown in FIGURE 7 and FIGURE 8.<br>
[81]	In phase one, illustrated in FIGURE 7, a mobile user 700 sends a request to<br>
the central LBS server, hosted by integrated location-based service platform 705 via a<br>
wireless carrier gateway 710 and Internet 715. Notably, the central LBS server maybe<br>
hosted independent of integrated location-based service platform 705 as well. The<br>
request seeks the address of local-content servers, possibly including local-content server<br>
720 serving the user's geographical location. The request preferably further comprises an<br>
indication of the geographical location of the mobile user, such as the user's approximate<br>
latitude and longitude, although such an indication is not required for practicing the<br>
invention since it may be obtained automatically via a location determination service by<br>
triangulation or other means.<br><br><br>
[82]	Upon receiving the request, central LBS server 600, illustrated in FIGURE 6,<br>
preferably implemented as a collection of servlets, forwards the message to mall selection<br>
servlet 605 residing in server 600. Mall selection servlet 605 includes a listing of various<br>
malls and may be connected to an integrated location based service platform. Mall<br>
selection servlet 605 then parses the message to obtain the user's geographical location<br>
and queries database 610, with the aid of mall specific service 630, for the name and URL<br>
of local-content servers, such as local-content server 720 of FIGURE 7, serving the<br>
user's location. Central LBS server 600 then responds to the request with a list of names<br>
and URLs of the local-content servers serving the user's location. As shown in FIGURE<br>
6, central LBS server 600 may be a standalone server including store information and<br>
administrative operations capability via mall specific servlet 615, mapping and directions<br>
from mapping servlet 620 and local service integration by integrated location-specific<br>
platform 625. Alternatively, mall specific servlet 615 may serve as the front-end to an<br>
integrated location specific services platform. FIGURE 6 also shows store table 635 and<br>
sales table 640 for providing various services, and which tables are preferably stored in<br>
RDBMS 610.<br>
[83]	In phase two, the mobile user establishes contact with specific local-content<br>
server 720, by sending a request with privileges of either a mall administrator or a simple<br>
end-user. If only one local-content server was found by central LBS server 600, the<br>
mobile user client may be redirected to local-content server 720 without the user's<br>
intervention. Otherwise the user is presented with a display comprising a list of local-<br>
content servers servicing the user's location. The list may be filtered based on<br>
personalization information stored on the user's client 700 or provided by central LBS<br>
server 600.<br>
[84]	FIGURE 8 further illustrates interactions between clients 800 and 840 and an<br>
integrated location-based service platform performing multiple functions. Client 800<br>
sends a request to a central operations center, e.g., using a wireless link, and is connected<br>
to central LBS server 810 (which could also be an integrated location-based service<br>
provider). The request may comprise a mall map, store location, sales/specials, updating<br>
of sale data and the like. Integrated location-based service provider 810 connects to<br>
repository 815 to retrieve necessary information, and may further request second local<br>
central LBS server 820, if required, for a map, a specific location, or specials. Second<br><br><br>
central LBS server 820, in turn communicates with a map service 825 or specials service<br>
830, in communication with repository 835 for determining available specials. In<br>
addition, client 840, being in the vicinity, directly communicates with second central LBS<br>
server 820 for services.<br>
[85]	In this example, users can retrieve sale information for stores in the malls in<br>
their area. Sale information for each store is maintained by a store administrator for each<br>
store. A store administrator can get, add, delete and update sale information for the<br>
administrator's store, while an end-user can, preferably, only retrieve sale information.<br>
Sale and authorization information is stored, for instance, in two tables in the local-<br>
content server database, stores table 900 and sales table 910, as shown in FIGURE 9.<br>
The stores table 900 comprises authentication (password) information for stores in the<br>
mall. When a user attempts to administer sale information for a store, the user is<br>
prompted for a password. If the password matches the password for the store in the stores<br>
table 910, the user is allowed to administer the store sale information stored in the sales<br>
table for that store. FIGURE 10 is a flow chart indicating the actions available to a store<br>
administrator, which allow remote monitoring of stores with the possibility of conducting<br>
inspections and the like if required.<br>
[86]	During step 1000 in FIGURE 10, a user with store administra'tor privileges<br>
chooses a mall to access. Next, during step 1005, the store administrator is presented<br>
with a secure login screen. Control passes to step 1010 in the event the login fails, and<br>
preferably at least a limited number of retries are allowed by transferring control to step<br>
1005. Limiting retries is preferred, but not required, since it counters denial of service<br>
attacks and other security breaches.<br>
[87]	From step 1005 control flows to step 1015, during which sales for a target<br>
store may be retrieved. In response, or otherwise, the administrator may elect to, during<br>
step 1020, add, update, or delete a sale. For these illustrative operations, control flows to<br>
step 1025 for entering a new sale, which may be approved in step 1030 or fail during step<br>
1035; step 1040 for deleting a sale, which may be approved in step 1045 or fail during<br>
step 1050; and step 1055 for selecting a sale for updating during step 1060, which may be<br>
approved in step 1065 or fail during step 1070 respectively.<br><br><br>
[88]	FIGURE 11 is a flow chart indicating the actions available to a user who has<br>
been provided with a list of local-content servers by the central LBS server or may have<br>
received a splash screen image during step 1102, possibly of a promotion, advertisement,<br>
or a message indicating start of an application. During step 1100, selection or a response<br>
results in a user receiving a mall list selection followed by, during step 1105, selection of<br>
a store search method. The user may, during step 1110 find a store by name; or during<br>
step 1115 find stores based on products. Control flows to step 1120 from step 1115, so<br>
that a user may find all stores by a specific product category or to step 1125 for finding<br>
stores by their typical product categories with selection of a store by product during step<br>
1130. Control following store selection flows from steps 1110 and 1130 to step 1135,<br>
during which the display of a target store's sales list information is selected. Control then<br>
flows to step 1140, during which sale information is displayed. Directions to or maps for<br>
the target store may then be obtained during steps 1145 and 1150 with various degrees of<br>
specificity, denoted by selection of a zoom parameter value.<br>
[89] FIGURE 12 indicates the corresponding Java panels used by the example<br>
application illustrated in FIGURE 11. Thus, step 1102 corresponds to map panel 1202,<br>
which is shown in FIGURE 13, step 1100 to selection panel 1200, and so on.<br>
Corresponding panels in FIGURE 12 are labeled in a manner similar to the labeling in<br>
FIGURE 11. The individual user interface is depicted in FIGURES 13 - 22, which are<br>
described in greater detail next.<br>
[90]	In FIGURE 13, corresponding to 1202 and 1102, the user has started a client<br>
application on his mobile device, preferably a java-enabled cell phone using a mobile<br>
positioning system. When the user selects "OK" 1301, a request including an indication<br>
of the user's location is sent to the central LBS server. The central LBS server responds<br>
with a list of local-content servers serving the user's location, which is displayed on the<br>
user's client system as illustrated in FIGURE 14, corresponding to step 1100 and panel<br>
1200. In this example, two malls are near the user, the Crossgates mall and the Colonie<br>
Center mall. If the user selects the Crossgates mall 1402 and selects "OK" 1401, the user<br>
is presented the display illustrated in FIGURE 15, which corresponds to step 1105 and<br>
panel 1205.<br>
[91]	FIGURE 15 illustrates a user interface that allows the user to indicate<br>
whether the user wishes to enter a store name, or to select a store by the item offered on<br><br><br>
sale. If the user selects "Sales by store name" 1502, and then selects "OK" 1501, the user<br>
is presented a text-box display for entering a store name. If the user selects "stores by<br>
sale item," and then selects "OK" 1501, the user is presented with the display illustrated<br>
in FIGURE 16, which corresponds to step 1115 and panel 1215.<br>
[92]	FIGURE 16 illustrates a user interface that allows the user to indicate<br>
whether the user wishes to enter an item name, or to select an item by category. If the<br>
user selects "sale item by name" 1603 and then selects "OK" 1601, the user is presented a<br>
text-box display for entering an item name. If the user selects "sale item by category"<br>
1602 and then selects "OK" 1601, the user is presented with the display illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 17, which corresponds to step 1120 and panel 1220.<br>
[93]	FIGURE 17 illustrates a user interface displaying categories of items for<br>
which the mall-server contains sale information, which user interface also allows the user<br>
to select a sale category. If the user selects "Dress Shoes" 1702 and then selects "OK"<br>
1701, the user is presented with the display illustrated in FIGURE 18, which corresponds<br>
to step 1130 and panel 1230.<br>
[94]	FIGURE 18 illustrates a user interface displaying a list of stores having sale<br>
items in the mall-server database in the category selected by the user, and allows the user<br>
to select a store. If the user selects the store "DSW" 1802 and then selects "OK" 1801,<br>
the user is presented with the display illustrated in FIGURE 19, which corresponds to<br>
step 1135 and panel 1235.<br>
[95]	FIGURE 19 illustrates a user interface displaying sale items in the local-<br>
content server database for the DSW store selected by the user. If the user selects the<br>
item "Dress Shoes" 1902 and then selects "OK" 1901, the user is presented with the<br>
display illustrated in FIGURE 20, which corresponds to step 1140 and panel 1240.<br>
[96]	FIGURE 20 illustrates an interface displaying information about the sale<br>
item selected by the user, which user interface also allows the user to request a map<br>
showing the location of the store relative to the user. If the user selects "OK" 2001, the<br>
user is presented with the display illustrated in FIGURE 21, which corresponds to step<br>
1145 and panel 1245.<br>
22<br><br>
[97]	FIGURE 21 illustrates a user interface displaying a map showing the location<br>
of the store relative to the user and allowing the user to request a zoomed-in map showing<br>
the store location in more detail. The user's location is shown as a pair-of-shoes icon<br>
2102, and the store's location is shown as a dot icon with the name (or abbreviation) of<br>
the store 2103. The map is automatically scaled to show both the user and the store<br>
locations. If the user selects "OK" 2101, the user is presented with the display illustrated<br>
in FIGURE 22, which corresponds to step 1150 and panel 1250. FIGURE 22 illustrates<br>
a map zoomed-in to show the store location in more detail.<br>
[98]	Local-content server servlet 720 (or 615) preferably provides JAVA calls for<br>
both administrators and end users. These calls include: getSalesByStoreName(<store></store>
name&gt;);getSalesByStoreLogin(<password>);deleteSale(existingsale<br>
record);addNewSale(sale to create record); updateSale(existing sale record in DB);<br>
getStoresByProduct(<product name>); and getStoreInfo(<store name>). In alternative<br>
embodiments additional or alternative calls may be provided for allowing both<br>
administration and browsing by users based on their respective privilege levels.<br>
[99]	Thus, location based services can be offered in accordance with the present<br>
invention in an integrated location based service platform or as stand-alone services. The<br>
services range from sales promotions, discovering nearby stores, locations to matching<br>
events and generating maps using various modes of transportation.<br>
[100]	Thus, an integrated location based service platform may further include a<br>
plurality of third party servers such as those accessible at a network address<br>
corresponding to a response to a request for at least one geographic feature. In addition,<br>
the geographic feature is preferably an address of a location-based-information-system<br>
server associated with a user location, which preferably provides: personalization data as<br>
part of the person profile service; and links to one or more local servers associated with<br>
the user location and corresponding to input profile data or a user profile. Furthermore,<br>
the location-based-information-system server preferably redirects a user to a first local<br>
server, or provides a choice of local servers.<br>
[101] A local server may provide additional user profile information, and<br>
information about one or more of sales, promotions, availability of a product or service,<br><br><br>
alternative sellers of a specified product close to the user location, or alternative providers<br>
of a specified service close to the user location.<br>
[102]	In another aspect, a user interface responsive to one or more taps or strokes<br>
on a pad, one or more clicks of an input device, or a voice command is provided to a<br>
client. Such a user interface is also useful for making subsequent requests (such as using<br>
a nearest geographic feature to get to content of local stores on local servers and<br>
directions to a store using the routing service).<br>
LOCATION SENSITIVE EVENT SERVICE<br>
[103]	Yet another example of location based services is a location sensitive event<br>
service, such as the CoolEvent® service offered by the Maplnfo® Corporation, which<br>
service finds a list of events that are of interest to a service subscriber or other user, based<br>
on the user's location and preferences stored in a profile. This service, like the peer-to-<br>
peer location based service may be offered in association with an integrated method and<br>
system, such as the miAware™system offered by the Maplnfo® Corporation, described<br>
previously, or be provided as a stand-alone service. The returned events are sorted by<br>
distance between the user's current location and an event place. A demographic analysis<br>
is performed to returned selected events.	,<br>
[104]	The design underlying the location sensitive event service is not limited to<br>
use in locating events, but, without limitation, may also be used for a variety of other<br>
applications, such as wireless advertising, or in generating matches for dating services. In<br>
another aspect, the design underlying the location sensitive event service is also<br>
intelligent such that increased use of the service results in refining the user profile without<br>
additional end user input. Moreover, the present system and method may also be used,<br>
for example, in a dating service to determine whether to introduce individuals based on<br>
their profiles.<br>
[105]	In another aspect, the location sensitive event service may also provide<br>
content filtering capabilities in the user profiles - i.e., options to allow users to preselect<br>
content which they would like to find, either on demand or as a result of polling.<br>
[106]	FIGURE 23 illustrates an exemplary architecture for an embodiment of the<br>
location sensitive event service. User 2301 subscribes to the location sensitive event<br><br><br>
service provided via servlet 2305. Web scraper 2320 culls possible events from event<br>
sources 2325 to generate events in event database 2330. Event database 2330 is<br>
processed in accordance with demographic event model 2310 to generate a list of suitable<br>
events for the servlet 2305. At the user end, subscribers 2335 provide information 2340,<br>
which is used to augment user profile database 2345 and generate and refine demographic<br>
user model 2315.<br>
[107]	Servlet 2305 matches the user profile with the event profile to generate an<br>
ordered list of events that may be provided to user 2301.<br>
[108]	Information 2340 preferably includes personal preferences such as music, art<br>
and food and any other preferences or parameters of interest. This information is used by<br>
the CRM engine to sort events matching a user's interests. An example set of personal<br>
preferences is as follows:<br>
Gender, Age, MusicPref, ArtPref, SportsPref, FoodPref, AlcohoPref,<br>
SexualOrient, and Religion.<br>
Additional personal information that may be relevant includes:<br>
Personal ID (linked with personal profile)<br>
Residence Type: single family/town house/condo/ etc<br>
Resident Type: owner/renter etc<br>
Employment Status: employed/unemployed etc<br>
Type of occupation: student/blue collar/ service/white collar/executive<br>
Marital Status: married/single etc<br>
Kids in household (and their respective ages)<br>
Partner Status: none/steady/not steady<br>
Car Access<br>
Interest in a specified service, etc.<br>
Example behavioral characteristics(with optional groups) may include:<br>
What kind of music do you like?<br>
What kind of sports do you like to watch?<br><br><br>
What do like to do on a Saturday night?<br>
Are you interested in meeting folks to date?<br>
If, yes ...what type of folks? And any additional questions.<br>
[109]	Another view of an architecture providing a location sensitive event service,<br>
operating as a customer relation management tool, is illustrated in FIGURE 24. Client<br>
2400 communicates, for instance over the web using web protocols such as HTTP and<br>
with markup languages like XML to specify various interfaces, with location sensitive<br>
event service servlet 2405. Client 2400, for instance the CoolEvents™ client supported<br>
by Maplnfo® Corporation, may be a J2ME MIDlet and, furthermore, it may be based on<br>
existing MLS services. This allows most of the basic functions of MLS such as mapping,<br>
routing and geocoding to be also used.<br>
[110]	Location sensitive event service servlet 2405, in turn, communicates with<br>
profile database 2410 of mobile location service subscribers to obtain personal<br>
preferences for a particular user. Such personal preferences may be generated with the<br>
additional aid of personal extension database 2415. Location sensitive event service<br>
servlet 2405 may be implemented as a allows stand-alone implementation, although,<br>
integrated location-based service provider 2420 may be used for relation management<br>
service as well. Alternatively, optional customer relation management engine 2425,<br>
designed specifically for this application or a functional equivalent, can directly interact<br>
with location sensitive event service servlet 2405 instead of integrated location-based<br>
service provider 2420.<br>
[111]	An example of a CRM service is found in the MapXtend™ service provided<br>
by the Maplnfo® Corporation. This service accesses a customer relation management<br>
(CRM) service, e.g., aCRM service of an integrated location based service platform, for<br>
instance miAware™ system provided by Maplnfo® Corporation. Optionally, a CRM<br>
engine specifically designed for this purpose can be made available, including as an<br>
alternative or to supplement the miAware™ system.<br>
[112]	The illustrative miAware™ service for CRM mentioned previously in the<br>
context of FIGURE 24 accepts an XML request which includes login ID and current<br>
location of the client. The service retrieves personal information through miAware™<br>
profiler using the login ID, then gets personal preference data. An XML element is then<br><br><br>
created and sent to the CRM engine. The returned list of events is sent back to the client.<br>
The MapXtend™ service typically includes the following functions.<br>
[113]	Retrieving personal preferences information from a location service, such as<br>
MLS, profiler database, and possibly additional databases. If a database keeps only<br>
limited personal information, then, advantageously, an additional database may manage<br>
personal preference data. This database may be linked to the profiler database by, for<br>
instance, the user's login name.<br>
[114]	Converting the personal preference data into XML, or another markup<br>
language suitable for sending information, and sending it to, for instance, miAware™<br>
aCRM service. If this is not available, the location sensitive event service may send the<br>
data directly to a CRM engine.<br>
[115]	Returning an event list, to the client, if desired, this event service event list<br>
can be returned as MXTD DAR (representing the MapXtend specifications).<br>
[116]	Some specific MXTD commands are listed below to illustrate an<br>
implementation for a location sensitive event service:<br>
Start: a command to start a session. If the user has already logged in, e.g., with<br>
miConnect, the user's profile may be automatically retrieved, otherwise a login by the<br>
user provides a login name and password. Alternative authentication methods may<br>
also be employed, if desired, to start the session. Start command preferably triggers a<br>
search by the CRM engine to return an original recommendation of events for the<br>
user, in accordance with a current location (preferably the user's) and profile data.<br>
Route_map: this command requests a map centered at a chosen event place, with,<br>
preferably, a routing line highlighted on the map.<br>
directions: this command requests a textual, or an alternative such as Braille or<br>
audio, description of routing directions for the client to get to the event place.<br>
[117]	Personal Preferences may be conveniently represented in a table, as shown<br>
below:<br><br><br><br>
[118]	Personal Preferences are advantageously stored in a preferences database that<br>
lists user preferences. A look-up table for coded preferences assists in accessing the<br>
database. Exemplary table entries may look like:<br>
Personal ID<br>
Preference code: codes are grouped (music, sports, activities...)<br>
Preference rank, which are entered as<br><br>
[119]	In personal preferences, a rank value is used to indicate the priority that the<br>
user gives to a certain type of an event category (e.g., basketball in Sports), this is an<br>
input value from the user. In the event match model, a score is calculated for the user on<br>
each event. This score is used to rank the events.<br>
[120]	An example preferences Code Look-upTable is shown below:<br><br>
[121] Following subscriber registration, preferably including a password, user<br>
registration for the present session may be accomplished using one or more web-pages<br>
and an appropriate wizard. In an exemplary embodiment the first page may be a modified<br>
version of the current miProfiler™ provided by Maplnfo® Corporation. A second page<br>
may collect additional personal information, advantageously (but not necessarily) in a<br>
way similar to the first page. A third page collects personal preferences. The user selects<br>
an option and ranks it. Even though expandable DHTML elements may cover many<br><br>
preference classes (for instance, music, sports, sports viewer, activities, alcoholic<br>
beverages and movies), some classes may result in a long list. A scrollable list box may<br>
hold the selections, with buttons for the user to select the items into another list box in<br>
which the items are sorted according to which button is clicked.<br>
[122]	If desired, changes may be made to the above address panel to include<br>
residence/resident types.<br>
[123]	An event database is also preferably built and updated for providing a<br>
location sensitive event service as illustrated in FIGURE 23. A real world event<br>
database should be dynamic and typically changes daily. Subscribing to an external<br>
database such as Toronto.com is a possible maintenance mechanism with the aid of an<br>
exemplary client program to access such an external service. A web scraper designed to<br>
scrape a particular website, e.g., Toronto.com, may be created to access event data from<br>
the website.<br>
[124] Some example profiles are: 1) a 26 year old, male University of Toronto<br>
student on a Friday evening; 2) a 46 year old Bay street business man on a Friday night<br>
with/without the wife; 3) a typical Mississauga housewife with 3 children.<br>
[125]	As shown in FIGURE 24, an interface to an optional CRM Engine is also<br>
preferably provided. To this end, language-specific APIs (Java/C# etc) may be<br>
considered as well. An exemplary XML API may comprise the following input and<br>
output:<br>
[126]	Inputs: three elements: personal data, preferences and address. Personal data<br>
preferably includes items required by miProfiler™ plus additional attributes. Preferences<br>
is preferably a sequence of preference codes and ranks.<br>
[127]	In an output, a sequence of event elements is generated with each event<br>
element preferably including an event name, and a detailed description comprising a<br>
place, date and time.<br>
[128]	In an exemplary embodiment, an event finder engine helps find, from the<br>
event database, the event or the top N events that best match a user's preferences.<br>
Numerical measurements that represent a comparison of events to a user's preferences<br><br><br>
may be determined. To compare an event with a person's preferences, both the event and<br>
the preferences should have a set of common attributes. This set of common attributes<br>
may be used to calculate the differences between an event and a personal profile. Before<br>
comparing, events and personal profiles are abstracted to form a vector of selected<br>
attributes. The process of defining the attribute set is a dynamic one that improves as<br>
more data accumulates in the user database.<br>
[129]	To illustrate the computations underlying matching events to users, an<br>
exemplary calculation is presented next. It should be noted that the matching formulae<br>
may be varied as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, qualitative attributes may be given numerical values for comparison<br>
purpose. For instance, 1 or 0 may be used for two-state attributes. For multi-state<br>
attributes, more consideration is preferable, since, for instance, if an event is good for<br>
single persons, then the event is more likely suitable for a divorced person than for a<br>
person with an unsteady partner.<br>
[130]	In another aspect, attribute abstraction is possible in a location sensitive event<br>
service. Illustratively, with a personal preference set including a person's preferences on<br>
music, sports, sports to watch, movies, activities and beverage tastes, the preferences are<br>
divided into six(6) groups each of which may be given an equal weight of 1/6 points.<br>
[131]	For each preference group, personal selections may be ranked. For instance,<br>
a person's musical preferences may be ranked as:<br>
1,	JAZZ	(1.0)<br>
2,	POP/ROCK (0.8)<br>
3,	OLDIES (0.6)<br>
[132]	Depending on the data accumulated, illustrative percentages may be assigned<br>
to these three music types as: (100%, 80%, 60%).<br>
[133]	With a database of N events, each event being assigned attributes of six (6)<br>
types, e.g., music, sports, sports to watch, movies, activities, and alcohol/beverage tastes,<br>
since an event belongs to certain types, and may be more one type than another, weights<br>
may be assigned to each type. For instance, a concert could be assigned weights like:<br>
Music = 0.8<br>
Sports = 0.0<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
STANDARDIZATION OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES:<br>
[138]	A standardized vector is a vector that is scaled to the means of all possible<br>
values. Since the comparison is carried out between two attribute vectors for an event:<br>
event attributes and preference attributes, and attribute values are taken from a big range,<br>
they must be standardized to range in a common scale (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0, or 0 to 100) to<br>
make the comparison possible. To standardize a preferences vector, means and standard<br>
deviations of all attributes may be calculated using all records in the database. Then<br>
attribute k may be standardized as:<br><br>
[139]	Standardization of Events may be undertaken after all the events are assigned<br>
attributes. They may be standardized by the same procedure as for personal preferences.<br>
However, this may not always be necessary since while assigning the attribute values,<br>
standardized values may be chosen.<br>
[140]	FIGURE 25 summarizes a process for generating ordered lists of events<br>
corresponding to user profiles. Profiles database 2500 is used to generate standardized<br>
profile database 2505 reflecting the distribution of various attributes that are part of the<br>
various profiles. The standardized profile database allows generation of attributed<br>
personal preferences 2530 that can be compared in the manner illustrated above.<br>
[141]	Similarly, event database 2510 leads to attributed event profile 2515. The<br>
event and personal profile attributes are then subjected to multivarient comparison 2520<br>
to effect matching by generating scores for each match. The scores for different matches<br>
are then compared 2525 to generate the ordered lists actually used to plan events, or to<br>
provide users with available event related details.<br><br>
[142]	As is readily seen, event planning, generation of directions based on multiple<br>
modes of transportation, or managing/browsing stores in the vicinity are illustrative<br>
examples of location based services. Any combination of these services may be<br>
integrated using the integrated location based services platform in a dynamic manner<br>
since new services can be added, or existing services updated with the aid of the XML<br>
encoded specifications. Adding a service is as simple as choosing a unique name<br>
followed by publishing the service to the service manager in the specified manner. The<br>
limited rules for adding and publishing services, being themselves encoded in XML, are<br>
both easy to follow and readily available.<br>
[143]	In another aspect, responses to requests for particular services may elicit<br>
information about sales, promotions, products, services, or events associated with a user<br>
profile or preference, preferably arranged in a sorted list for selection of one or more<br>
entries. Each event is, preferably, associated with a plurality of weighted event attributes<br>
types and values of event attribute subtypes. Similarly, each user profile comprises a<br>
plurality of weighted profile attributes (such as those organized into vectors and<br>
matrices). These allow for generation of a similarity score based on shared attributes and<br>
their respective weights in arriving at a list of events matched to the user profile or vice<br>
versa. Advantageously, the profile attributes may be standardized using the available data<br>
in the various databases, such as the event and the profile databases, to improve the<br>
comparison between profiles and event attributes.<br>
[144]	In another aspect, the present invention includes a stand-alone service for<br>
assisting a user to locate stores, directions to such stores and browse various products and<br>
services. The service is configured to receive a request from a client device (e.g., a thin<br>
client on a cell phone), and retrieve a record comprising an identifier of a second server<br>
system that is better suited to provide content from the specified location (e.g., a sale at a<br>
specified store in a mall). Moreover, the service may be further configured for one or<br>
more of adding, deleting, and updating of store sale records, retrieving a map from a map<br>
server, or a record based on request location criterion and a user profile. The user profile<br>
may include personalization information, which may be useful in providing personalized<br>
information about services available in a geographic area of interest.<br>
[145]	In another aspect, the present invention also encompasses a communication<br>
system comprising a server system, for instance, the miAware™ system of Maplnfo®<br><br>
Corporation, that is configured to provide a location and an ordered list of events matched<br>
to a user profile to a client device (e.g., a cell phone). Each event in the list of events is<br>
associated with weighted event attributes types and values of event attribute subtypes, and<br>
the user profile is associated with weighted profile attributes, which are used to compute a<br>
similarity score.<br>
[146]	The profile attributes may be standardized using statistics (such as a mean<br>
and a standard deviation) of the profile attributes in a database having a plurality of user<br>
profiles, and, similarly, the event attributes may be standardized using statistics based on<br>
the event attributes in an event database. Then, the similarity scores between events in a<br>
database and a specified user profile may be calculated by summing, over the events in<br>
the database, the square of the differences between standardized event attributes and<br>
corresponding standardized specified user profile attributes, or, alternatively, by<br>
summing, over substantially all users in the database, the square of the differences<br>
between standardized user profile attributes and corresponding standardized specified<br>
event attributes.<br>
[147]	It should be noted that the processing described in the context of matching<br>
events and user profiles is also applicable to matching services like advertisements and<br>
promotions to users.<br>
[148]	In another aspect, the present invention includes a method for providing<br>
location based services. The method may be illustratively be described as comprising the<br>
steps of receiving a request for a service in a message encoded in a markup language<br>
(XML) at the service manager; optionally authenticating the request; detennining whether<br>
the service is available at a plurality of service modules registered with the service<br>
manager (by accessing the catalog of services); forwarding an error message in response<br>
to determuning that the service is not available at the plurality of service modules;<br>
forwarding the request to a service module (the request object) in response to determining<br>
that the service is available; and sending a result received from the service module (the<br>
response object) to a client device (as an XML encoded response).<br>
[149] In addition to the steps listed above, the client device sending the request may<br>
have a different address than the address of the client device receiving the result, or,<br><br><br>
alternatively, the client device (e.g., browser on a cell phone) is redirected to another<br>
server (the local-content server).<br>
[150]	A method for providing location based information in accordance with the<br>
invention includes receiving a request that also comprises information identifying a user<br>
and a location (e.g., the cell phone location) to enable retrieval of the user profile and one<br>
of more records based on said request and a location criterion. Furthermore, the local-<br>
content server located in this manner may provide additional details such as information<br>
about sales, promotions, availability of a product or service, alternative sellers of a<br>
specified product close to the location, or alternative providers of a specified service close<br>
to the location.<br>
[151]	In another aspect, the present invention includes a method for providing a list<br>
of events matched to a user profile comprising comparing a user profile (e.g., via the<br>
miAware™ system or a standalone system) with a database of events with the aid of<br>
profile attributes from the user profile and event attributes; generating similarity scores<br>
for events corresponding to the user profile; ordering the list of events according to one or<br>
more of a location criterion, a specification (e.g., a personal preference), and the<br>
similarity scores; and providing at least an ordered subset of the list of events to the user.<br>
[152]	In addition, for each event, the event is assigned a weight with respect to each<br>
attribute type and a value for an attribute subtype (may be considered to be an event<br>
matrix). The user profile includes values for the profile attributes (a profile vector),<br>
wherein one or more of the event types and profile attributes are weighted to reflect their<br>
relative significance. The similarity scores between events in the database and the user<br>
profile are calculated by summing, over substantially all events in the database the square<br>
of the differences between standardized event attributes and corresponding standardized<br>
user profile attributes (this corresponds to <br>
[153]	The described method is suitable for not only for detennining matched<br>
events, but also for providing a list of users matched to an event (e.g., useful for<br>
determining whether the demographics are favorable for staging a proposed event,<br>
targeting an enriched audience with advertising, and the like). This may include<br>
comparing an event with a database of user profiles with the aid of profile attributes from<br>
the user profiles and event attributes; and generating a list of users with their<br><br>
corresponding similarity scores. The list of users may be ordered according to a location<br>
criterion, a specification, or the similarity scores.<br>
[154]	In another aspect, the present invention includes design of a suitable thin<br>
client by a module for constructing service requests aided by helper classes to construct<br>
and submit service requests to the service manger. The module is implemented with no<br>
dependence on core server software to make it independent of the server and incorporates<br>
a parser to process responses received from the service manager.<br>
[155]	It should be noted that the described embodiments are illustrative only and<br>
should not be understood as limiting the scope of the invention. The invention, as will be<br>
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, admits of many variations which are intended<br>
to be covered by the description herein and the attached claims. It should be so<br>
understood and interpreted.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A Method for Providing Location Based Services<br>
The disclosed method provides extensible or stand-alone location<br><br>
enabled services at granularity down to a stand-alone service. The various interfaces are<br>
preferably specified via DTD or schemas for communication based on XML (400). This<br>
collection of services enables management of mobile device locations information<br>
(420), and real-time services. Mobile device location is integrated with other location<br>
sensitive data, such as maps (465) or demographics of a particular region or even the<br>
location of businesses and consumers to enable a richer service offering for customers<br>
of wireless carriers (405) and service providers. Examples of such services include<br>
obtaining routes to a destination (470) ; providing a geocode corresponding to an<br>
address (450); providing an address corresponding to a geocode (440) ; providing maps<br>
as image files encompassing specified geocodes, locations, or addresses and the like.<br>
Additional services may be added to the disclosed system and method seamlessly due to<br>
the use of extensible interfaces.</store></product></password></td>
