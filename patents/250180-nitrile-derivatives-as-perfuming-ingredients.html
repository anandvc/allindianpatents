				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns substituted benzylic nitriles which are useful as perfuming ingredients, in<br>
particular to impart odor notes of the floral-green type.<br>
The present invention concerns also the use of said compounds in the perfumery<br>
 industry as well as the compositions or articles associated with said compounds.<br>
Prior art<br>
Amongst the compounds of formula (I), as defined below, a few are known. In<br>
particular, all the compounds wherein the dotted line represents a double bond have been<br>
previously described for various purposes such as chemical intermediates (for example:<br>
butylidene-benzeneacetonitrile has been reported by S.I. Murahashi et al. in Synlett,<br>
2000, 1016). However, none of the prior art documents disclosing a compound of formula<br>
(I) reports or suggests any organoleptic properties of the invention's compounds, or any<br>
use of said compound in the field of perfumery.<br>
	The compounds described in EP 682010 or in US 6069125 are the known<br>
perfuming ingredients having the closest structure to the invention's compounds.<br>
However, the invention's compounds not only differ from the prior art compounds in their<br>
chemical structure but also in the organoleptic properties which are, in the case of the<br>
prior art, of the marine or rosy-fruity(sweet) type. Nowhere in said two patents there is a<br>
suggestion of any usefulness of the invention's compounds in the field of perfumery, and<br>
even less of any organoleptic properties of the present compounds.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered that a compound of formula<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 is a C1-4 linear alkyl group, and<br>
a)	the dotted line represents a double bond having a configuration E or Z or a mixture<br>
	thereof, and R2 is a hydrogen atom; or<br>
b)	the dotted line represents a single bond, and R2 is a C1-4 linear alkyl group;<br>
can be used as perfuming ingredient, for instance to impart odor notes of the floral type.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, R' represents a C2-C3<br>
linear alkyl group, and in particular a n-propyl group.<br>
	According to any of the above mentioned embodiments, the compounds wherein<br>
the dotted line represents a double bond are preferred, and in particular those having said<br>
double bond in a configuration essentially Z, i.e. the Z isomer representing at least 90%<br>
relative to the weight of the mixture.<br>
Amongst said compounds of formula (I) those wherein the dotted line represents a<br>
 single bond and<br>
i) R1 is a C3-4 linear alkyl group and R2 is a methyl group; or<br>
ii) R1 is a C1-4 linear alkyl group and R2 is a C2-4 linear alkyl group<br>
are new and are an object of the present invention.<br>
Amongst the compounds of formula (I), one may cite in particular, and as non-<br>
 limiting example, (2Z)-2-phenyl-2-hexenenitrile. This compound has a substantive and<br>
powerful floral, green-floral, odor with jasmine-muguet, lilac, herbal-lavender-rosemary<br>
notes. The overall odor of this compound has a strong hexylcinnamic aldehyde<br>
connotation (i.e. herbaceous-floral) and is also slightly green-geranium (e.g. of the-<br>
diphenyl oxide type). The odor of the invention's compound has also bottom notes<br>
presenting amyl salicilate and chocolate aspects.<br>
More interesting, this compound can also display citrus or citronella notes<br>
depending on the medium into which it is incorporated, as will be further illustrated in the<br>
examples.<br><br>
When compared to the prior art compound 2-phenyl-2-hexanenitrile (see<br>
EP 682010), the invention's compound distinguishes by lacking, or by not possessing<br>
significant, anethole/carvone-like undernotes, as well as by lacking, or by not possessing<br>
significant, fruity (pineapple) and rosy notes which are characteristic of the prior art<br>
compound. Said difference lends to (2Z)-2-phenyl-2-hexenenitrile and 2-phenyl-2-<br>
hexanenitrile to be each suitable for different uses, i.e. to impart different organolpetic<br>
impressions.<br>
Another example of invention's compound is 2-(4-methylphenyl)hexanenitrile<br>
which possesses an odor with floral-jasmine and geranium notes as well as nitrilic and<br>
 fruity notes. The overall scent is close to the fragrance of hexylcinnamic aldehyde.<br>
Yet another example of invention's compound is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)pentanenitrile<br>
which is characterized by a nice florale-jasminic and hyacinth note having also a<br>
coumarine aspect. The bottom notes of this compound reminds of the odor of<br>
hexylcinnamic aldehyde.<br>
	These last two compounds named do not have or are almost devoid of a particular<br>
fruity or rosy connotation, to the contrary of 2-phenyl-2-hexanenitrile (see EP 682010)<br>
Amongst the compounds of formula (I), (2Z)-2-phenyl-2-hexenenitrile and 2-(4-<br>
methylphenyl)hexanenitrile are the preferred ones.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of a compound of formula (I)<br>
 as perfuming ingredients. In other words it concerns a method to confer, enhance,<br>
improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed<br>
article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount<br>
of at least a compound of formula (I). By "use of a compound of formula (I)" it has to be<br>
understood here also the use of any composition containing compound (I) and which can<br>
be advantageously employed in perfumery industry as active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which are in fact perfuming compositions that can be<br>
advantageously employed as perfuming ingredient, are also an object of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br><br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from<br>
a perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties<br>
of perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
	As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting examples solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials, for example, may<br>
comprise wall-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides,<br>
natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids: Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
 co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming preparation or<br>
composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor.<br>
	The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br><br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
	Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
	An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I)<br>
and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as<br>
well as a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least<br>
one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
	It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the<br>
perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various<br>
compounds of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Its is also understood here that, unless otherwise indicated or described, any<br>
mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without an adequate purification,<br>
in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a starting, intermediate or<br>
end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
 fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I) as defined above; and<br>
ii) a consumer product base,<br><br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
 formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer products include solid or liquid detergents and<br>
fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes,<br>
colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or<br>
 gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
 articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
It has to be mentioned that the invention's compounds, due to their chemical<br>
structure, which renders them quite resistant to many aggressive medium, are particularly<br>
suitable for the preparation of perfuming composition for the functional perfumery.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
 incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given<br>
base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
	For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.001 % to 15 %by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br><br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 10% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be synthesized by a new and original process,<br>
which is also an object of the present invention.<br>
	The invention's process is particularly useful for the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 represent, independently from each other, a hydrogen atom or a C1-4<br>
linear alkyl or alkoxy group, and R5 represents a C1-8 linear or branched alkyl;<br>
by reacting a nitrile of formula<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 have the meaning indicated above;<br>
with an alcohol of formula R5 CH2OH, wherein R5 represents a C1-8 linear or branched<br>
alkyl or alk-2-enyl;<br>
in the presence of a catalytic system, said process being characterized in that the reaction<br>
temparature is above 100°C and the catalytic system is a mixture comprising a base,<br>
having a pKa above 13, and a complex selected from the group consisting of [RuCl2<br>
(p-cym)]2 and [RuCl2(p-cym)(PPh3)], p-cym meaning p-cymene.<br>
When R5, in formula R5CH2OH, represents an alkyl group then there is obtained a<br>
compound of formula (II) wherein the dotted line represents a single bond. When R5, in<br><br>
formula R5CH2OH, represents an alk-2-enyl group then there is obtained a compound of<br>
formula (II) wherein the dotted line represents a double bond.<br>
The complex is generally used in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 molar<br>
equivalent relative to the amount of compound of formula (III).<br>
	Typical examples of base useful for the invention's process are KOH, NaOH or<br>
DBU. Moreover, preferably, the base is present in an amount of about 5 to 15 molar<br>
equivalents relative to the amount of the complex.<br>
Furthermore, in said process the alcohol R5CH2OH may advantageously be used as<br>
solvent, i.e. in a large excess compared to the amount of compound of formula (III).<br>
	Preferably, the compounds of formula (II) are those of formula (I).<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 400 or 100 MHz machine for 1H or respectively 13C, the<br>
 chemical displacements δ are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the<br>
coupling constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of compounds of formula (I) according the invention's process<br>
a) Preparation of (2Z)-2-phenyl-2-hexenenitrile<br>
A 500 ml three necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an argon inlet-<br>
outlet, was charged with benzylnitrile (17.6 g, 150 mmol), crotyl alcohol (86.54 g,<br>
 1.2 mol, trans/cis mixture: 23/1), potassium hydroxide (420.9 mg, 7.5 mmol) and<br>
[RuCl2(p-cym)]2 (229.8 mg, 0.38 mmol). The flask was then evacuated, back filled<br>
with argon and heated at 100°C for 1.5 hour. When the reaction was terminated, the<br>
reaction mixture was cooled and poured into water (500 ml), extracted with AcOEt<br>
(3 x 100 ml). The organic phases were dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and the<br>
 solvent was removed in vacuo. Distillation under reduced pressure gave the desired<br>
nitrile with a yield of 45%.<br>
1H-NMR analysis of this mixture showed also that nitrile was present as a mixture of<br>
two diastereomers (Z/E = 95/5).<br><br>
B.p.:121-123°C/5.4 mbar<br>
13C NMR: 146.9 (d), 133.3 (s), 128.9 (d), 128.8 (d), 125.6 (d), 116.7 (s, CN), 116.1 (s),<br>

b) Preparation of 2-(4-methylphenyl)hexanenitrile<br>
A 500 ml three necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an argon inlet-<br>
outlet, was charged with 4-methylbenzylcyanide (19.73 g, 150 mmol), 1-propanol<br>
 (89.1 g, 1.2 mol), potassium hydroxide (423.5 mg, 7.5 mmol) and [RuCl2(p-cym)]2<br>
(232.6 mg, 0.375 mmol). The flask was then evacuated, back filled with argon and<br>
heated at 100°C for 1 hour. When the reaction was terminated, the reaction mixture<br>
was cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was taken into<br>
Et2O (500 ml) and washed with water (3 x 50 ml). The organic phase was dried over<br>
 anhydrous MgS04, filtered and the solvent was removed in vacuo. Distillation under<br>
reduced pressure gave the desired nitrile with a yield of 70%.<br>
B.p.: 105-106°C/1.3 mbar.<br>
13C NMR: 137.7 (s), 133.1 (s), 129.7 (d), 127.1 (d), 121.1 (s, CN), 36.9 (d), 35.6 (t),<br>
29.1 (t), 22.1 (t), 21.0 (q), 13.8 (q).<br>
 1H NMR: 7.19 (AB syst. JAB = 8.2, 4H), 3.72 (dd, J= 8.4, 6.4, 1H), 2.34 (s, 3H), 1.95-<br>
1.78 (m, 2H), 1.52-1.29 (m, 4H), 0.89 (t, J= 7.2, 3H).<br>
c) Preparation of 2-(4-ethylphenyl)pentanenitrile<br>
Following the same procedure given in b), 4-ethylbenzylcyanide (5.08 g, 35 mmol),<br>
 1-propanol (21 ml, 280 mmol) were reacted with potassium hydroxide (99.1 mg,<br>
1.75 mmol) and [RuCl2(p-cym)]2 (55.1 mg, 0.09 mmol) at 100°C for 1 h. Removal of<br>
the solvent and distillation under reduced pressure gave the desired nitrile with a yield<br>
of 51%.<br>

The addition of 300 parts by weight of (2Z)-2-phenyl-2-hexenenitrile to the above-<br>
described perfuming composition provided a new composition which had a fragrance<br>
more functional, detergent-like. Moreover the new composition had a reinforced green-<br>
citronella connotation.<br>
Furthermore, when linen was washed with a detergent containing the new composition,<br>
 said linen after drying had a powerful salicylate note, of the floral-herbaceous type, which<br>
was totally absent from a linen washed with a detergent containing the composition not<br>
containing the invention's compound.<br>
This connotation/note was lacking pineapple and rosy character.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a perfuming composition<br>
A perfuming base for a soap was prepared by admixing the following ingredients:<br>

The addition of 150 parts by weight of (2Z)-2-phenyl-2-hexenenitrile to the above-<br>
described perfuming base imparted to the fragrance of the latter a clear floral-jasmine and<br><br>
salicylate connotation slightly green and cosmetic. This connation was lacking pineapple<br>
and rosy character.<br><br>
