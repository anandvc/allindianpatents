				<td>The present invention relates to a Membrane for Surface Coating<br><br>
Membranes of polymer modified bitumen have become a trend in the industry. <br><br>
What are membrane types?<br><br>
With the advent of membrane technology, Built Up Roofing (BUR) has been made a class by itself. It is still the single biggest type of roofing installed. The new materials introduced as alternatives to Built Up Roofing are products of different chemical formulations. Although no panacea, they do provide a wide range of options that meet required performance characteristics. The first generation of these materials suffered some setbacks due to lack of design and performance criteria and also lack of experience.<br><br>
Membrane Technology on roofs and other substrate of the building are quite well known. Materials used as masonry coating are Bitumen products, Asphalts, Acrylates, Polyurethanes, epoxies or Polyesters dissolved in suitable solvents. Actually, we can divide the membranes into liquid membranes or sheet membranes. The advantage of a liquid applied system are that material is sprayed over the entire roof as a liquid and dries to form a monolithic surface - no seams. While the sheet membranes like Asphalt and various grades of bitumen felts are quite commonly used and the advantages are that the preparation of the substrate is not as critical since membrane is usually separated from deck by a separation course, The other advantage is that roof contamination and roof cracking is not as crucial.<br><br>
The terms sheet and membrane tend to be interchangeable. By definition, a membrane refers to the finished built-up waterproofing layer comprising one or more prefabricated sheets. As such, a sheet becomes a membrane in a single-ply application and a modified bituminous membrane may have two sheets, base and cap.<br><br>
Most of these membranes are composed  of mastic which  is the waterproofing component, and reinforcing fabrics which give the membranes the desired physical properties.<br><br>
Some important disadvantages with coatings<br><br>
Blister formation due to out gassing of the slab or the presence of moisture. This is generally found with the single coat liquid applied membrane systems where the membrane thickness is less than 2 mm.<br><br>
Poor resistance to chemical attack.<br><br>
Asphalt shifting occurs under wheel loading. This is generally a function of the asphalt stability and thickness of the membrane,<br><br>
Debonding of membrane where vapour pressures exceed bond strength. This is a particular problem with sheet applied adhesive membranes where vapour gets trapped.<br>
Due to the thickness of the system, concrete delaminations on the surface of the slab are not evident at an early date.<br><br>
Mastic type wearing surfaces are not suited to exterior applications.<br><br>
On exterior applications black surface increases temperature of slab, increasing slab thermal movement and cracking.<br><br>
Additional load to the structure<br><br>
Use of bitumen is known since last 5000 years and even now consumption of bitumen has grown to 75 million tones a year with road construction grabbing the lion's share (80%).<br><br>
In addition to Built Up Roofing, there are many different types of new membranes that are mostly prefabricated sheets or liquid applied materials that cure to form waterproof sheets or closed cell foams. They are made from a wide variety of synthetic organic materials (polymers) with various chemical compositions and additives. In some cases natural materials such as bitumen, organic fibres, etc. are compounded with them.<br><br>
In surface coating, the pores and capillaries are blocked and the natural breathing of the building is hampered. Consequently these impermeable surface coating may allow water to build up behind the surface coating with the risk of disruption to the coating and possibility of damage. Infact trapped water would be moving behind surface coating and wherever it finds weaker segments, it would come out resulting in cracks and blisters in the surface. Moreover the aging process begins with exposure of the roof surface to the elements of area and ultra violet light. This photo-oxidation sometimes causes the top layer to become brittle. As the weathering continues and the fluctuation in temperature causes expansion and contraction, the membrane becomes even more brittle and less able to accommodate the normal expansion and contraction of the roof. Surface cracks appear, become deeper at the time passes and gradually exposes the unprotected layer to weather resulting in the deterioration of the membrane and causing seepage.<br><br>
THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF THE THICK TOPPINGS IN GENERAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br><br>
1.	Blister formation<br><br>
2.	Poor resistance to chemical attack.<br><br>
3.	Asphalt shifting<br><br>
4.	Debonding of membrane<br><br>
5.	Concrete delaminations on the surface of the slab are not evident at an early date.<br><br>
6.	Mastic type wearing surfaces are not suited to exterior applications.<br><br>
7.	On exterior applications black surface increases temperature of slab, increasing slab thermal movement and cracking.<br><br>
8.	Additional load to the structure.<br><br>
9.	Need to consider impact on headroom.<br><br>
These disadvantages are more pronounced in bitumen<br><br>
The asphalt is applied to the roof as a base layer. If left unprotected, however, the asphalt degrades under ultraviolet light radiation, resulting in delamination and cracking. Blister formation is very common because of expansion and contraction on account of variable temperature. For example: - If white surface absorbs 40%, Black surface would absorb 90%. This results in photo oxidation and disintegration. Bitumen material under sunlight starts this photo-oxidation. It produces water soluble and volatile products by photo-oxidation, which is caused by ultra violet rays in the presence of oxygen. It has, therefore, long been recognized that it is necessary to protect base asphaltic roofing layers from ultraviolet light and temperature variation.<br><br>
In addition to problems related with durability of these membranes or coatings, we should also look into the possible harmful effects on our environment or on the health of the people who are handling these products. Let us understand that by and large only two bitumens are used in the roofing industry: Coal tar pitch and Asphalt. Coal tar pitch is a byproduct of the production of coke from coal; roofing asphalt is the oxidized residue of the distillation of crude oil.<br><br>
The basic chemical components of crude petroleum oil include paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as heterocyclic molecules containing sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen. The composition of the Asphalt will vary based on the origin of crude oil. Saturated felts consist primarily of organic or inorganic fibres (asbestos) which are interlocked to form a continuous sheet, then saturated with asphalt or coal tar pitch (organic felts only) and perforated for use in roofing. The coal tar is known to contain chemicals, which can be classified as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a class of chemical with harmful properties. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in high concentrations are harmful not only to wild life, but to humans as well,<br><br>
It is a well-known thing that the general exposure to asphalt fumes is by inhalation or they may also be absorbed through the skin, causing harm to concerned people. Most of the studies of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in animals have shown that the samples tested exerted mutagenic activity. However the mutagenic responses of the asphalt fume condensates were approximately 100 fold less than the coal tar pitch samples and weak to moderate in potency. Besides these carcinogenicity effects and skin problems reported in animals, it has been found that the workers engaged in these activities handling these products reported symptoms of abnormal fatigue, reduced appetite, eye irritation and laryngeal/pharyngeal irritation.<br><br>
Polymer Modified Asphalt and methods for preparing Polymer Modified Asphalt composition are well-known. There are several polymers which have been used including diene elastomers such as EPDM, EPR, butyl rubber, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, terpolymers, styrene conjugated diene copolymers and thermoplastic elastomers such as styrene-butadiene and styrene-isoprene block copolymers, are commonly combined with asphalt to improve the performance of the asphalt.<br><br>
In many concrete structural engineering buildings or other building materials including road asphalt are generally coated using different techniques to avoid penetration of water. This asphalt used as a construction body which is rigid and are generally vulnerable to the creation of cracks. Such cracks promote the penetration of water.<br><br>
There are several examples in the literature where bitumen sheets, self-adhesive bitumen or polymer modified bitumen sheets are used. However this needs lot of surface preparation like application of primer using scaffolding handling of open flames etc., Apart from it being very complex heat spraying technology these kinds of techniques need warm weather and dry surfaces.<br><br>
The use of asphalt is very common in USA, However when asphalt is used as roofing material it need torch heating and heating method of asphalt has several drawbacks for example when asphalt is melted, smoke and odour are heavily generated which does not only effect the environment but toxic gases which are carcinogenic in nature affect the workers. To avoid this problems cold construction method has been used and for this they use blown asphalt, which is brittle and tends to crack at low temperature, (the material is hard) different products have been used like rubber modifier, natural rubber, Styrene butadiene, however these modifiers are poorly compatible with asphalt. Recently there are patents on Curable composition but they have the same problems,<br><br>
In addition to BUR there are many different types of new membranes that are mostly prefabricated sheets or liquid applied materials that cure to form waterproof sheets or closed cell foams. They are made from a wide variety of synthetic organic materials (Polymers) with various chemical compositions and additives. In some cases natural materials such as bitumen, organic fibers, etc., are compounded with them. <br><br>
Need to consider impact on headroom.<br><br>
Names of some of them are as follows.<br><br>
Classification				Membrane<br><br>
Conventional roofing			Bituminous built-up roofing (BUR)<br>
Prefabricated sheets			Thermoplastic sheets<br>
•	PVC and blends<br>
•	EIP (ethylene interpolymer)<br>
•	CAP (copolymer alloys) Elastomeric (synthetic rubber) sheets<br>
•	Vulcanized:<br>
EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene monomer)<br>
•	Non-vulcanized:<br>
CSPE (chlorosulfonated polyethylene) CPE (chlorinated polyethylene)<br><br>
PIB(polyisobutylene) NBP (butadiene-acrylonitrile) Modified bituminious sheet<br>
•	Polymer modifiers<br>
SBS (Styrene-butadiene-styrene)<br>
APP (atactic polypropylene)<br>
IPP (isotactic polyproylene)<br>
Cast in sit				Hot applied rubberized asphalt<br>
Cold applied liquid compounds<br>
•	Various polymeric and bituminous materials<br>
Polyurethane foam roof with protective coating<br><br>
Generally unstable on steep sloped applications.<br><br>
Specially in temperate climate of India some of the roofs are exposed to the sun's rays from sunrise to sunset and much of the sunlight strikes the roof surfaces at a steep angle. A dark roof coated by bitumen can attain a very high surface temperature and in addition the reflected radiation from adjacent surface can raise the surface temperature much above that attained by direct radiation. We all know that colour has a great role to play in the absorption of solar irradiation by surface for example: - If white surface absorbs 40%, black surface would absorb 90%. This results in photo oxidation and disintegration caused by ultra violet rays in the presence of oxygen and the bitumen material produces water soluble and volatile products, mostly polyaromatic, which adversely affect the environment since most of these compounds are carcinogenic.<br><br>
The Indian climate has summer, winter and monsoon seasons and each season has a different range of temperatures. This fluctuation can contribute to the breakdown of bitumen and in addition it can lead to large thermal movements of the total membrane.  The seasonal variation is not the only cause but in towns like Bangalore short time variation in temperature also affects the durability of bitumen.<br><br>
If there is a fire in a structure, roof structures and materials reduce the risk of fire from the neighbouring  buildings from spreading.     However the resistance of bitumen materials is generally poor, making it an additional problem with bitumen surfaces.<br><br>
Roof Membrane can be damaged by pollutants from the environment and local pollution.   These pollutants deposited on the roof surface may form acids that can damage the exposed bitumen membrane. This process of damage continues until rain washes the waste into the drain.<br><br>
While laying  bitumen  / tarfelt  membrane,  basic flaws  and  defects  in  structural membrane are not taken into consideration, since it is just a covering over the surface.<br>
Tarfelt or any bituminous products are prone to oxidation, thereby slowly becoming brittle and developing cracks.  Since these types of treatments are physical barriers, the trapped moisture tends to come out in the hot weather cycle and form blisters which subsequently burst and create openings for water entry.   Cracks which occur due to aging also contribute to water entry and once water enters below the tarfelt layer, it tends to come out through the slab or any weak points in the structure, thus damaging the reinforcement.<br><br>
Earlier bitumen was used but because of its inherent disadvantages and toxicity it was necessary to modify this bitumen and change its properties. Initially bitumen was modified by using styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) or rubber emulsion. However, in the recent past several membranes that are of polymer-modified bitumen have entered in the market. Unfortunately all these membranes are to be torched on the surface at high temperatures.   At those very high temperatures polyaromatic compounds get oxidized and toxic gases like benzpyrene are emitted and photo-oxidation under UV light is very normal consequence.<br><br>
PRIOR ART<br><br>
US 7402619 relates to a bituminous composition comprising a bituminous component, an elastomeric polymer component, and a specific cross-linking composition component comprising elemental sulfur, a sulfur-containing derivative, a sulfur activator, a fatty acid or fatty acid derivative and a polymeric carrier. Compositions according to the invention are particularly useful in preparing polymer-modified asphalt ("PMA") for road applications.<br><br>
US 2004/0249024 teaches a dispersing agent that facilitates the delivery of a cross-linking agent to polymer modified asphalt. It further includes a composition comprising a liquid hydrocarbon, the dispersant and cross-linking agent, and methods of preparing the composition and of preparing cross-linked polymer modified asphalt composition.<br><br>
US 6767939 discloses a method for preparing an asphalt and thermoplastic elastomer composition. The process comprises heating an asphalt cut in a stirred tank to a temperature sufficient to allow the stirring of the asphalt in the tank. A thermoplastic elastomer or rubber is added to the asphalt while continuing to stir the asphalt. The mixture is stirred at a speed and for a period of time sufficient to increase the distribution of the elastomer into the asphalt. The stirring speed is reduced and the temperature is increased to add crosslinking agents to the tank. Stirring is continued for a period of time sufficient to improve the distribution of the crosslinking agent dispersion in the asphalt. Crosslinking agents include compositions of mercaptobenzothiazole, zinc oxide and elemental sulfur; compositions of mercaptobenzothiazole, zinc oxide, and mixed polythiomorpholine; and compositions of zinc 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and dithiodimorpholine,<br><br>
US 6569925 relates to an accelerator-gel additive used to deliver an accelerator such as sulfur, into a system for the production of polymer modified asphalt, vulcanized rubber or similar system. Unlike conventional methods of delivering accelerator into the system, the accelerator-gel additive suspends the accelerator in a gel system thereby preventing the sedimentation of the accelerator during processing. As a result, the polymer and asphalt are processed at lower temperature reducing the production of toxic and flammable gases such as hydrogen sulfide.<br><br>
US 7439286 teaches a modified asphalt composition comprising at least one plastomer, at least one elastomer, and asphalt. More specifically, a modified asphalt composition is provided comprising an oxidized polyethylene, a styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer, and asphalt. A hot mix asphalt composition is also provided comprising the modified asphalt composition and aggregate. Processes for producing the modified asphalt composition and the hot mix asphalt composition is also provided as well as articles produced from these inventive compositions.<br><br>
MX 2007004739 teaches that asphalt and polymer mixtures treated with an inorganic acid and cross-linked with sulfur and/or other crosslinkers or accelerators gives a polymer modified asphalt with improved high temperature properties. The acid should be added to the asphalt before the crosslinker.<br><br>
CN 101125957 discloses a method for preparing polymer modified asphalt and is divided into the following steps. First melted substrate asphalt is mixed with polymer modifying agent to form evenly melted polymer modified asphalt system and then added to a double-screw extruder and an extruding reaction takes place in the double-screw extruder and the polymer modified asphalt is obtained, wherein, the temperature in the first area of the double-screw extruder ranges from 90-190 DEG C, in the second area of the double-screw extruder ranges from 100-250 DEG C, in the third area of the double-screw extruder ranges from 120-220 DEG C and in the fourth area of the double-screw extruder ranges from   120-220  DEG  C.  The  invention  has simple manufacturing process, short manufacturing time with the manufacturing cycle of 0.5-1 h and reduces control process and can realize continuous industrial production.<br><br>
The performance of membranes: A brief generic list of roofing membranes is given in the following Table. In each type there is a long and growing list of products. No two products are identical even if they consist of the same predominant polymer. A manufacturer may have a number of different products: unreinforced, or reinforced with different fabrics, for protected or exposed application, with different seaming techniques and different attachment methods, availability in different colours, etc.      (O.

The Applicant has been able to develop self-adhesive non-toxic membranes with the above properties.<br><br>
The applicant decided to work on modern catalyst and polymers to produce polymer modified bitumen which can be used in cold without torching in thickness of 1 to 2 mm. Thus these membranes developed by the applicant have no problems of heating or the disadvantages mentioned above. Unlike other membranes available in the market the applicant developed membranes can be applied directly on the concrete in cold without torching and thus it is not only more durable and bonded but also because of non-torching it is environmentally friendly. This is a major breakthrough in this development.<br><br>
