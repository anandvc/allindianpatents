				<td>IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES<br>
This invention is concerned with improvements in &amp; relating to composite materials and<br>
structures, particularly those with auxetic properties (i.e. with a negative or effectively<br>
negative Poisson's ratio), methods of producing auxetic composite materials and applications<br>
for auxetic composite materials.<br>
Unlike most conventional materials auxetic materials expand perpendicular to an axis about<br>
which they are stretched. This gives such materials a variety of useful properties. Existing<br>
auxetic materials and the techniques for their production, such as those detailed in<br>
WO00/53830, face significant problems in producing auxetic materials in a reliable manner<br>
and/or on a scale suitable for industrialisation. Additionally such prior art materials are<br>
formed from a single material and thus have restricted properties as a result. The present<br>
invention aims to address problems with prior art materials and their production techniques.<br>
The present invention has amongst its aims the provision of improved auxetic composite<br>
materials, methods of manufacturing auxetic composite materials and applications for auxetic<br>
composite materials. Methods of manufacturing are envisioned that aim to be appropriate for<br>
industrial scale production or fabrication at a wide range of scales. The present invention has<br>
amongst its aims the provision of auxetic composite materials and methods for producing<br>
such materials which are reliable in their structure and properties and which would offer a<br>
greater range of material properties and uses.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention we provide a composite component<br>
having a negative effective Poisson's ratio, the composite component including a first<br>
component and a second component, the first component and the second component<br>
extending longitudinally relative to an axis, the first component being wrapped around the<br>
second component through one or more turns, the one or more turns being spaced<br>
longitudinally relative to the axis, variation in the tensile load on the first component causing<br>
the radial position of the second component relative to the axis to vary.<br><br>
According to a second aspect of the invention we provide a composite component having a<br>
negative effective Poisson's ratio, the composite component including a first component and a<br>
second component, the first component and second component extending longitudinally<br>
relative to an axis, the first component being wrapped around the second component through<br>
one or more turns, the first component having a higher modulus of elasticity than the second<br>
component, variation in the tensile or compressive load on the first component causing the<br>
radial position of the second component relative to the axis to vary.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention we provide a composite component having a<br>
negative effective Poisson's ratio, the composite component including a first component and a<br>
second component, the first component and the second component extending longitudinally<br>
relative to an axis, the first component being wrapped around the second component in a<br>
helical manner, variation in the tensile or compressive load on the first component causing<br>
variation in the diameter of the helix the first component follows, the variation in the<br>
diameter of the helix of the first component causing the second component to take on the<br>
form of a helix and/or causing the diameter of the helix of the second component to vary, the<br>
diameter of the second component helix increasing as the first component helix decreases in<br>
diameter, the diameter of the second component helix decreasing as the first component helix<br>
increases in diameter.<br>
The first and / or second and / or third aspects of the invention may include any of the<br>
features, options or possibilities set out elsewhere in this document and particularly from<br>
amongst the following.<br>
The composite component and/or a structure produced there from may have any negative<br>
value of Poisson's ratio. The system may have a Poisson's ratio of between 0 and -5. A<br>
Poisson's ratio of between -3 and -4 may particularly be provided.<br>
The first component may be a fibre, rod or hollow tube particularly of a relatively high<br>
modulus material. The first component may be formed of carbon fibre, glass fibre,<br><br>
polyaramids(e.g. Kevlar TM), polyamides (e.g. nylon), polyesters, polyalkylenes,<br>
polyethyleneterepthalate(PET), metal wire, cotton or other material. The materials from<br>
which the first component is formed may be natural or man made, inorganic or organic. The<br>
first component may be sealed with a cured film, for example a cured siloxane film. In the<br>
event that the first component is a hollow tube, the tube may contain additional materials.<br>
The second component may be a fibre, rod or hollow tube, particularly consisting of an<br>
intermediate or a low modulus material. The material is preferably capable of deformation<br>
without fracture. The second component may be formed of siloxane, liquid silicone rubber,<br>
natural rubber, nitrile rubber or any other elastomeric material whether natural or man-made.<br>

materials. The additional materials may or may not be auxetic. The additional materials may<br>
have different properties to the tubing.<br>

The variation in the tensile or compressive load on the first component may be a variation in<br>
the load applied along or parallel to the axis. The variation in the load may be an increase in<br>
the load. The variation in the load may be a decrease in the load. The first component may<br>
have the load increased from zero to a load value to cause the variation, or may have the load<br>
reduced from a first value to a second lower value to cause the variation. The load may be<br>
applied at the ends of the first component and / or may be introduced at an intermediate<br>
location.<br>
The radial position of the second component may be measured perpendicular to the axis.<br>
Preferably the variation in radial position is an increase in the displacement of at least a part<br>
of the second component relative to the axis when the load is varied, the variation particularly<br>
being an increase when the load is a tensile load and a decrease when the load is a<br>
compressive load. Preferably the variation in radial position is a decrease in the displacement<br>
of at least a part of the second component from the axis when the load is varied, the variation<br>

This invention is aimed at providing improved structures &amp; production techniques for auxetic<br>
materials, as well as improved auxetic materials themselves. It should be noted that where the<br>
term materials is used, it is taken mat this includes textiles and fabrics amongst other<br>
possibilities.<br>
Auxetic materials are materials having a negative actual or effective Poisson ratio. That is to<br>
say, when a tensile load is applied to an auxetic material to stretch it along a first axis it<br>
expands along a second axis perpendicular to that first axis. Materials are also auxetic if a<br>
compressive load is applied along the axis of a material and the compression results in a<br>
reduction in width along a second axis perpendicular to that first axis. This is contrary to the<br>
behaviour of most materials which exhibit a positive Poisson ratio. A material's Poisson ratio<br>
is determined by the ratio of the contractile transverse strain relative to the tensile<br>
longitudinal strain.<br>
Synthetic auxetic materials were first produced in the late 1980's by mechanical deformation<br>
of open cell polymeric foams. Subsequent techniques have aimed to produce honeycomb<br>
style polymeric materials or materials formed by particles linked by fibrils.<br>
An example of a honeycomb style auxetic polymer material is illustrated in Figure la.<br>
Applying a tensile load along axis X-X causes stems 1 and 3 to move apart. However, this<br><br>
movement cause the stems 5 and 7 to straighten and thus increase the separation of stems 9<br>
and 11. The result is an increase in the extent of the material along axis Y-Y which is<br>
perpendicular to axis X-X.<br>
An example of a particle &amp; fibril based auxetic polymer material is shown in Figure 1b. This<br>
provides a series of particles 13 which are linked by fibrils 15. The fibrils 15 are generally<br>
produced from the same material as the particles 13 by the extrusion and/or subsequent<br>
spinning process. Again, moving particles 13a and 13b apart along axis X-X causes the<br>
fibrils 15a, 15b to straighten and hence increase the separation of particles 13c and 13d. An<br>
increase in the materials extent along axis Y-Y, perpendicular to axis X-X, thus occurs. Such<br>
materials have been produced using compaction and sintering stages, or as detailed in WO-<br>
00/53830, by partially melting and then extruding the single polymeric material.<br>
A variety of techniques for producing auxetic materials have been suggested, with quite<br>
varying form and level of negative Poisson ratio. In many cases, however, the production<br>
method is complicated and generally suited to producing only very small amounts of auxetic<br>
material of questionable consistency. In other cases, the nature of the process, surface<br>
melting and extrusion to form the material from a single material, results in an auxetic<br>
material which is far less even in structure and properties than is implied in the schematic<br>
representations thereof in the prior art and Figures la and lb of this document. Cross-linking<br>
of particles, incomplete fibril structures, non-discrete particles and other problems are<br>
encountered. Substantial difficulties also exist in turning such prior art auxetic material<br>
samples into useful shapes or forms.<br>
The present invention seeks to address these issues and provide an auxetic material which is<br>
relatively easy to produce, is consistent in its structure and properties, has an appreciable and<br>
controllable negative Poisson ratio and can readily be used to form more complex and useful<br>
forms.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 the auxetic material of the present invention is in effect a composite<br>
component made up of a number of components. Here it is illustrated in a partially strained<br><br>
state. Contrary to prior art auxetic materials the present material is formed of a number of<br>
separate components and potentially of separate components having different material form<br>
or properties.<br>
Running through the centre is a core component 20. This core component 20 is generally<br>
linear in configuration and provides the core for a composite structure. The core component<br>
20 also defines an axis of the structure, X-X. To either side of the core component 20 are<br>
first components 22a, 22b. The first components 22a, 22b are provided in conjunction with<br>
second components 24a, 24b. In each case, the first component 22 is wrapped around die<br>
second component 24 in a spiralling manner. That is to say, the first component 22 contacts a<br>
different part of the circumference of the second component 24 as progress is made along the<br>
components 22, 24. As a result of this wrapping, the first component 22 at least, has an<br>
extent of displacement relative to the axis X-X which varies with position along the axis X-X.<br>
Thus at location 28 the displacement is greater man at location 26.<br>
The extent of displacement of the other first component 22b relative to the axis X-X is of the<br>
same extent for the same position 26, 28 etc along axis X-X, but the direction of displacement<br>
may be in the opposite direction relative to the axis X-X. Hence, parts 32 of the first<br>
component 22b are close to one another and parts 30 of the first component 22b are relatively<br>
far apart. This is achieved by wrapping the first components 22a, 22b around the second<br>
components 24a, 24b in opposing directions.<br>
In the illustrated case, both the first component 22 and second component 24 have a<br>
displacement relative to the axis X-X which varies with position along the axis X-X. The<br>
overall composite component thus provides through openings 34 of a given size.<br>
The overall form can be seen in the schematic cross-sectional view, viewed along axis X-X,<br>
of Figure 4. In this cross-sectional view the first component 22 starts at point A and advances<br>
up and over the second component 24 to point B, before descending the other, inside of the<br>
second component 24 to point C. There is a mirror image on the opposite side of the core<br><br>
element. The full transition of the first component 22 and fall extent of the second<br>
component 24 is not shown.<br>
In use, Figure 3, if a tensile load is applied, parallel to axis X-X, to the first components 22 of<br>
the composite component men that load straightens the first components 22 from their helical<br>
configuration to a straighter or even straight configuration. In Figure 3 the core component<br>
20 still occupies the centre of the composite component and the first component 22 is still<br>
wrapped around the second component 24. However, the straightening of the first<br>
components 22 has led to an increase in the diameter of the helix formed by the second<br>
components 24. The level of displacement of the second component 24 away from the axis<br>
X-X has the net effect of considerably increasing the overall extent of the composite<br>
component along axis Y-Y. The size of the openings 34 also significantly increases.<br>
As an alternative to helical forms for both the first components 22 and second components<br>
24, a functioning composite component could be provided using a linear second component<br>
24 and wrapped, displacement varying along the length, first component 22. This form is not<br>
illustrated in the Figures. In this case, the application of the tensile load would again<br>
straighten the first components 22 and hence cause the second components 24 to move from<br>
linear to helical form. Again an increase in the extent perpendicular to the direction of the<br>
tensile load occurs.<br>
Whilst different relative dimensions for the core component 20, first components 22 and<br>
second components 24 are illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4, a wide variety of different sizes<br>
are possible, both in absolute terms and in terms of the relative sizes of the different<br>
components to one another.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the core component 20 is itself a further auxetic<br>
component or structure, but may also be an elastomeric rod of intermediate or low modulus.<br>
It is desirable that the core component be capable of deformation without fracture. Suitable<br>
materials include siloxane, liquid silicone rubber, natural rubber, nitrile rubber or any other<br>
elastomeric material whether natural or man-made. In the event that the core component is a<br><br>
hollow tube, the tube may contain additional materials that may or may not be auxetic, and<br>
the additional materials may have different properties to the tube. The first components are<br>
desirably of high modulus of elasticity, for instance carbon fibre, kevlar, glass fibre, or wire.<br>
The second components are again desirably elastomeric in nature. A very wide range of<br>
materials can be employed, however, dependant on the desired properties, application and<br>
scale of the resultant composite structure. Further possibilities are outlined later in this<br>
document.<br>
The composite component of Figures 2, 3 and 4 is in effect a structure from which larger<br>
structures or articles can be formed.<br>
In Figure 5 an alternative structure is illustrated in cross-sectional end view. The structure is<br>
an expanded version of the structure illustrated above in the Figure 2, 3 and 4 form of the<br>
invention and uses similar principals. In this case, the structure again features a central core<br>
component 20, but is provided with six second components 24 evenly positioned around the<br>
perimeter of the core component 20. Each of the second components 24 is provided with a<br>
first component 22 wrapped around it. Again the extent of the displacement of the first<br>
component from the axis running along the centre of the structure is the same for each of the<br>
first components at the same position along the axis. The direction of the displacement for<br>
each component is radially away from the axis. In the case of this structure, application of a<br>
tensile load causes expansion in all directions radially away from the core component 20. A<br>
similar arrangement may be constructed using more or less than six first and second<br>
component combinations.<br>
Whilst the structures described in relation to Figures 2, 3,4 and 5 offer negative Poisson ratio<br>
materials, the most useful forms of the present invention arise from the formation of finished<br>
articles out of such units e.g. to form fabrics, sheets, woven articles, non-woven articles.<br>
These involve the use of multiple structures of the type described above, or other such<br>
structures.<br>
In the case shown in Figure 6, each core component 20 is surrounded by four first<br><br>
components 22 and four second components 24, these being wrapped around one another to<br>
give the previously described combinations. The four combinations are evenly positioned<br>
around the core component 20. By providing a large number of structures in this way a body<br>
centred lattice is formed.<br>
In the case shown in Figure 7, each core element 20 is surrounded by six first component 22<br>
and second component 24 combinations. Again the six combinations are evenly positioned<br>
around the core component 20 and provide a close-packed arrangement as a result. Similar<br>
arrangements may be constructed using more or less than six first and second component<br>
combinations.<br>
These and other packing patterns allow substantial structures to be generated which are<br>
auxetic in behaviour. Most importantly, when compared with prior production techniques, as<br>
the auxetic structure is assembled from a number of components it is highly suited to mass<br>
production using variations on existing equipment designs mat are relatively simple to<br>
implement. For instance, it would be possible to extrude the core component and use<br>
spinerettes to create the first component and second component combinations. The number<br>
of first component and second component combinations for the desired form can then be<br>
assembled around the core component Assembly of multiple combinations provided in this<br>
way gives the desired bulk structure.<br>
In addition to the material composition produced from core, first and second components it is<br>
possible to include supplemental materials. In a preferred form the auxetic properties of the<br>
structure are supplemented by filling the voids in the structure with siloxane foam,<br>
polyurethane foam or other low modulus of elasticity materials. Further components or<br>
elastomeric rods can be included in the voids. The introduction of such materials to the<br>
formed product is also possible using industrial scale processes.<br>
It should also be noted that the Figure 2, 3, and 4 forms of the invention describe a structure<br>
that is strained to increase its extent perpendicular to the axis of strain. It is perfectly possible<br>
for the material to be pre-strained or pre-tensioned and exhibit its auxetic properties when the<br><br>
strain / tension is released and/or when compression is applied.<br>
In addition to mathematical calculations as to the level of negative Poisson's ratio exhibited<br>
by such materials the applicant has been able to experimentally demonstrate such properties.<br>
Referring to Figure 8a to fan experimental structure according to the present invention is<br>
provided. The structure is formed of two of the composite components 100 illustrated in<br>
Figure 8a. Two composite components 100 are provided in proximity with one another and<br>
each include a second component 104 that has a first componentl02 wound around it. The<br>
first components 102 are wound in opposing directions. Such a structure is shown in Figure<br>
8b unstrained.<br>
As a strain is applied to the structure, the auxetic properties are visible. In Figure 8c a<br>
longitudinal 10mm strain gives expansion of the gap between the components. The Figure 8d<br>
longitudinal 15mm strain, Figure 8e longitudinal 20mm strain and Figure 8f longitudinal<br>
25mm strain give increasing gaps due to the sideways expansion of the structure.<br>
The effect is clearly illustrated in Figure 9a and 9b which compare the projected angle of the<br>
first component relative to an axis perpendicular to the core axis of the structure. In this<br>
instance, in an unstrained state, an angle of 62° is observed, and in a partially strained state an<br>
angle of 74.5° is observed.<br>
As well as producing structures of this configuration using various component forms it is<br>
possible to generate such structures on a wide range of scales. Macro rods and fibres can be<br>
used to form bulk composite structures suitable for a variety of uses. At the other end of the<br>
scale various organic polymeric, inorganic polymeric or inorganic structures may be used to<br>
achieve molecular size auxetic materials.<br>
The auxetic composites and structures provided by the present invention offer a wide variety<br>
of beneficial properties. In particular, such structures may offer enhanced shear modulus,<br>
fracture toughness, piezoelectric properties, indentation resistance, thermal shock resistance,<br><br>
impact absorption, wear resistance and energy absorption over conventional materials.<br>
Usefully auxetic composites and structures according to the present invention may provide<br>
both impact and acoustic absorbing properties in a single material. There is also potential for<br>
these structures to display anisotropic effects where properties are different in axial and radial<br>
directions.<br>
Such composites and structures are seen as having particular application as textile materials<br>
for a wide variety of purposes. The auxetic structures of the present invention are particularly<br>
useful in the context of textiles due to their synclastic ability (the ability to form curves in<br>
two directions pointing in the same way). This makes such textiles particularly well fitting to<br>
other items they contact. This is true of both non-clothing, for instance crash helmet linings,<br>
and clothing type applications, for instance, comfortable body armour or clothing straps and /<br>
or belts.<br>
Applications for such composites and structures include situations where indentation<br>
resistance or the ability to absorb impacts are desirable, including car bumpers, car interior<br>
components, and moulded body parts. These properties also render such structures useful in<br>
the area of sports equipment where impact protection in the form of clothing or additional<br>
equipment is desirable. Such equipment includes head protection, shin pads, other pads and<br>
the like.<br>
The ability to offer acoustic damping from the same material which provides the above<br>
mentioned properties is also useful as previously two separate materials, one aimed at each<br>
issue were needed.<br>
The materials in the present invention also offer benefits in terms of their suitability for<br>
protecting hand held electronic devices, mobile phones, cameras, videos and the like e.g. for<br>
vibration, acoustic damping, or indentation resistance etc.<br>
Other potential applications include use in tyres, medical sutures, composites with enhanced<br>
properties (particularly through reduced fibre pull-out failures), electronic sensors (especially<br><br>
through the construction of pressure sensitive or optically sensitive materials), seat belts,<br>
luggage straps, clothing straps, doubly-curved structures, active materials (particularly<br>
filters), active textiles, enhanced wear reduction applications, thermal shock applications, etc.<br>
There are many potential methods by which such materials may be manufactured - these<br>
include braiding, knitting, spinning, extrusion, and embroidery, as well as a variety of woven<br>
and non-woven techniques.<br><br>
