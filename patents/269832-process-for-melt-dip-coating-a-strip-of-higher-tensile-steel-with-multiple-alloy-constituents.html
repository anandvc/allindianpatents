Process for melt dip coating a strip high-tensile steel<br>
In the construction of motor vehicle bodyworks, hot or cold-rolled, surface-refined steel<br>
sheets are used for reasons of corrosion protection. Sheets of this type are subject to numerous<br>
requirements. They have, on the one hand, to be readily deformable and, on the other hand, to<br>
have high -strength. The high strength is achieved by the addition to the iron of specific alloy<br>
constituents such as Mn, Si, Al and Cr. In order to optimise the property profile of steels of<br>
this type, it is conventional to anneal the sheets immediately prior to the coating with zinc<br>
and/or aluminium in the molten bath. Whereas the melt dip coating of steel strips containing<br>
merely low contents of the aforementioned alloy constituents is unproblematic, the melt dip<br>
coating of*steel sheet having higher alloy contents presents difficulties. On the surface of the<br>
steel sheet, there result defects in the adhesion of the coating, and uncoated points even form.<br>
In the prior art, there have been a large number of attempts to avoid these difficulties.<br>
However, there does not yet appear to have been an optimum solution to the problem.<br>
In a known process for melt dip coating a steel strip with zinc, the strip to be coated passes<br>
through a directly heated preheater (direct fired furnace - DFF). In the gas burners used,<br>
changing the gas/air mixture can result in an increase in the oxidation potential in the<br>
atmosphere surrounding the strip. The increased oxygen potential leads to oxidation of the<br>
iron on the surface of the strip. The iron oxide layer thus formed is reduced in a subsequent<br>
furnace stretch. Purposeful adjustment of the thickness of the oxide layer at the surface of the<br>
strip is very difficult. It is thinner at high strip speed than it is at low strip speed. A clearly<br>
defined composition of the surface of the strip therefore cannot be produced in the reductive<br>
atmosphere. Again, this can lead to problems of adhesion of the coating to the surface of the<br>
strip.<br>
In contrast to the above-described known system, modern melt dip coating lines comprising<br>
an RTF (radiant tube furnace) preheater do not use gas-heated burners. The iron therefore<br>
cannot be pre-oxidised by changing the gas/air mixture. Instead, in these systems, the<br>
complete Annealing treatment of the strip is carried out in an inert gas atmosphere. However,<br>
during such annealing treatment of a steel strip comprising relatively high alloy constituents,<br><br>
2<br>
these alloy constituents can diffuse to the surface of the strip, where they form non-reducible<br>
oxides. These oxides prevent optimum coating with zinc and/or aluminium in the molten bath.<br>
The patent literature discloses various processes for melt dip coating a steel strip with various<br>
coating materials.<br>
DE 689 12 243 T2 discloses a process for continuous hot dip coating a steel strip with<br>
aluminium, wherein the strip is heated in a continuous furnace. In a first zone, surface<br>
impurities are removed. For this purpose, the furnace atmosphere has a very high temperature.<br>
However, as the strip passes through this zone at high speed, it is heated merely to<br>
approximately half the atmospheric temperature. In the subsequent second zone, which is<br>
under inert gas, the strip is heated to the temperature of the coating material, aluminium.<br>
DE 695 07 977 T2 discloses a two-stage process for hot dip coating a steel alloy strip<br>
containing chromium, wherein the strip is annealed in a first stage to obtain iron enrichment at<br>
the surface of the strip. Subsequently, the strip is heated in a non-oxidising atmosphere to the<br>
temperature of the coating metal.<br>
It is known from JP 02285057 A to hot dip galvanise a steel strip in a multiple-stage process.<br>
For this purpose, the previously cleansed strip is treated in a non-oxidising atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of approximately 820°C. The strip is then treated at approximately 400°C to<br>
700°C in a mildly oxidising atmosphere before it is reduced at its surface in a reductive<br>
atmosphere. Subsequently, the strip, cooled to approximately 420°C to 500°C, is hot dip<br>
galvanised in the conventional manner.<br>
The object of the invention is to develop a process for melt dip coating a strip of high-tensile<br>
steel with zinc and/or aluminium, wherein a steel strip having an optimally refined surface is<br>
produced in an RTF system.<br>
This object is achieved by the following process steps:<br>
a) the strip is heated in a reductive atmosphere having an H2 content of at least 2% to 8% to a<br>
temperature of from 650°C to 750°C, at which the alloy constituents have not yet diffused to<br>
the surface.-or have done so merely in small amounts;<br><br>
3<br>
b)	the surface, consisting predominantly of pure iron, is converted into an iron oxide layer by<br>
heat treatment, lasting from 1 to 10 sec, of the strip at a temperature of from 650°C to 750°C<br>
in a reaction chamber which is integrated in a continuous furnace and has an oxidising<br>
atmosphere having an O2 content of from 0.01% to 1%;<br>
c)	the strip is then annealed in a reductive atmosphere having an H2 content of from 2% to 8%<br>
by further heating up to at most 900°C and then cooled down to the temperature of the molten<br>
bath, the iron oxide layer being reduced to pure iron at least at its surface.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the first step prevents basic alloy constituents from<br>
diffusing to the surface of the strip during the heating process. Ideally, diffusion of alloy<br>
constituents to the surface of the strip could be prevented completely, although in practice this<br>
is hardly ..possible. The important thing is that the diffusion of alloy constituents to the surface<br>
is suppressed to the extent that there can be formed in the following step an effective iron<br>
oxide layer preventing further alloy constituents from diffusing to the surface at the increased<br>
annealing temperature. The annealing treatment in the reductive atmosphere can thus yield a<br>
pure iron layer which is highly suitable for an extensive, tightly adhering zinc and/or<br>
aluminium coating.<br>
The result is optimal if the iron oxide layer produced in the oxidising atmosphere is reduced<br>
completely to pure iron, because in this case the deformation and strength properties of the<br>
coating are also optimised.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, in the treatment of the strip on the stretch<br>
having the oxidising atmosphere the thickness of the oxide layer formed is measured and<br>
adjusted, depending on this thickness and the treatment time, which is dependent on the<br>
throughput rate of the strip, the O2 content, in such a way that the oxide layer can then be<br>
completely reduced. The change in the throughput rate of the strip resulting, for example,<br>
from disturbances may thus be allowed for without disadvantage for the quality of the surface<br>
of the melt dip coated strip.<br>
Good results in the carrying-out of the process were achieved when an oxide layer having a<br>
thickness of at most 300 nanometres is produced. Good results were also achieved when the<br>
heating, preceding the oxidation, of the strip to 650°C to 750°C lasts at most 250 sec. The heat<br><br>
4<br>
treatment, following the oxidation, with subsequent cooling of the strip should last longer<br>
than 50 sec.<br>
As alloy constituents, the high-tensile steel should contain at least a selection of the following<br>
constituents: Mn &gt; 0.5%, Al &gt; 0.2%, Si &gt; 0.1%, Cr &gt; 0.3%. Further constituents such as, for<br>
example, Mo, Ni, V, Ti, Nb and P can be added.<br>
A basic feature of the invention is that the heat treatment of the strip in the reductive<br>
atmosphere lasts longer by a multiple, during both the heating process and the subsequent<br>
annealing, compared to the heat treatment in the oxidising atmosphere. As a result, the<br>
volume of the oxidising atmosphere is very small compared to the remaining volume of the<br>
reductive atmosphere. This has the advantage of allowing rapid response to changes in the<br>
treatment process, in particular in the throughput rate and the formation of the oxidation layer.<br>
In this sense, the heat treatment of the strip in the reductive atmosphere is carried out in a<br>
continuous furnace with an integrated chamber having the oxidising atmosphere, the volume<br>
of the chamber being smaller by a multiple than the remaining volume of the continuous<br>
furnace.<br>
The process according to the invention is particularly suitable for hot dip galvanising.<br>
However, the molten bath can also consist of zinc/aluminium or aluminium comprising<br>
silicon additives. Regardless of whether the bath consists of zinc or aluminium in isolation or<br>
in combination, the overall proportion of the melt formed thereby should be at least 85%.<br>
Examples of characteristic coatings known for this purpose include:<br>
Z:	99% Zn<br>
ZA:	95% Zn + 5% Al<br>
AZ:	55% Al + 43.4% Zn + 1.6% Si<br>
AS:	89 to 92% Al + 8 to 11 % Si<br>
In the case of a zinc coating (Z), said coating can be converted into a zinc/iron layer capable<br>
of deformation (galvannealed coat) by heat treatment (diffusion annealing).<br><br>
5<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter with reference to a diagram schematically<br>
showing a hot dip galvanising system comprising a continuous furnace, the temperature of the<br>
continuous furnace being plotted over the throughput time.<br>
A hot-rolled or cold-rolled strip 1 of high tensile steel having contents of Mn, Al, Si and Cr or<br>
some of these alloy constituents, although optionally also comprising further alloy<br>
constituents, in particular TRIP steel, is drawn off from a coil 2 and guided through an etchant<br>
3 and/or another system 4 for surface cleansing. The cleansed strip 1 then passes into a<br>
continuous furnace 5. From the continuous furnace 5, the strip 1 passes via an atmospherically<br>
sealed sluice 6 into a molten bath 7 containing zinc. From the molten bath 7, the strip 1 passes<br>
via a cooling stretch 8 or a means for heat treatment to a winding station 9 in the form of a<br>
coil. In contrast to the illustration in the diagram, the strip 1 actually passes through the<br>
continuous furnace 5 not in a straight line but rather in a meandering manner so as to allow<br>
sufficiently long treatment times to be achieved with a practicable length of the continuous<br>
furnace 5.<br>
The continuous furnace 5 is divided into three zones 5a, 5b, 5c. The central zone 5b forms a<br>
reaction chamber and is atmospherically sealed from the first and final zone 5a, 5c. Their<br>
length is merely approximately 1/100 of the overall length of the continuous furnace 5. For<br>
the sake of clarity, the drawing is therefore not to scale. In accordance with the differing<br>
lengths of the zones, the treatment times of the strip 1 passing through the individual zones<br>
5a, 5b, 5c also differ.<br>
The first zone 5a has a reductive atmosphere. A typical composition of this atmosphere<br>
consists of from 2% to 8% H2, the remainder being N2. In this zone 5a of the continuous<br>
furnace 5, the strip 1 is heated to 650 to 750°C. At this temperature, the aforementioned alloy<br>
constituents diffuse to the surface of the strip 1 merely in small amounts.<br>
In the central zone 5b, the temperature of the first zone 5a is substantially merely maintained.<br>
However, its atmosphere contains oxygen. The O2 content is between 0.01% and 1%. The O2<br>
content is adjustable and depends on how long the treatment time is. If the treatment time is<br>
short, the O2 content is high, whereas it is low in a long treatment time. During this treatment,<br>
an iron oXide layer is formed at the surface of the strip. The thickness of this iron oxide layer<br>
can be measured by optical means. The O2 content of the atmosphere is adjusted depending<br><br>
6<br>
on the measured thickness and the throughput rate. As the central zone 5b is very short<br>
compared to the overall length of the furnace, the volume of the chamber is correspondingly<br>
small. The reaction time for a change in the composition of the atmosphere is therefore short.<br>
In the subsequent final zone 5c, further heating is carried out to approx. 900°C, at which the<br>
strip 1 is annealed. This heat treatment is carried out in a reductive atmosphere having an H2<br>
content of from 2% to 8%, the remainder being N2. During this annealing treatment, the iron<br>
oxide layer prevents alloy constituents from diffusing to the surface of the strip. As the<br>
annealing treatment is carried out in a reductive atmosphere, the iron oxide layer is converted<br>
into a pure iron layer. The strip 1 is further cooled on its further path toward the molten bath<br>
7, so on leaving the continuous furnace 5 it has approximately the temperature of the molten<br>
bath 7 of ^Approximately 480°C. As the strip 1, after leaving the continuous furnace 5, consists<br>
at its surface of pure iron, it provides the zinc of the molten bath 7 with an optimum base for<br>
adhesively secure connection.<br><br>
