				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a novel<br>
proton conductive polymer gel useful as backfill for sacrificial and impressed<br>
current anode systems.<br>
Efficient functioning of any anode in a cathodic protection system depends<br>
on the backfill material used at the interface between the anode and the<br>
electrolyte. Normally in the cathodic protection of underground structures and<br>
pipelines buried in soil, chemical backfills in powder form are being used. But<br>
such a type of backfill will not be suitable for use in concrete structures.<br>
Chemical backfills can be helpful in adsorbing/absorbing soil moisture to keep<br>
the environment immediately surrounding the anode continuously moist. Thus<br>
better anode current efficiency is promoted. In the case of impressed current<br>
anode systems, carbonaceous backfills have been widely used. With regard to<br>
cathodic protection of reinforced concrete structures, a conductive overlay based<br>
on coke breeze has been used. More recently, hydroge! systems have been<br>
experimented. However an efficient ion conductive backfill, notably proton<br>
conducting backfill, in sheet form based on polymer has hitherto been unknown<br>
in the prior art*<br>
Literature search provides the references as given below. However, no<br>
patent is available on the use of ion conducting polymer for use in cathodic<br>
protection of concrete structures.<br>
Reference may be made to control of pipeline corrosion edited by A.W.<br>
Peabody and published by National Association of Corrosion Engineers, USA,<br>
1967, page No 107; where in use of carbonaceous backfill based on coal coke<br>
breeze, calcined petroleum coke breeze and natural or man made graphite<br>
backfills has been mentioned. The major drawback is that this material being in<br>
powder form must be tamped solidly around the anode. When the contact<br>
pressure cannot be made solid enough initially, or may relax with time, so that<br>
much of the current will discharge directly from anode to electrolyte, the anode<br>
life will get reduced. Petroleum Coke must be calcined to remove all other<br>
petroleum products, otherwise its resistivity will be too high.<br>
Reference may be made to control of pipeline corrosion edited by A.W.<br>
Peabody and published by National Association of corrosion Engineers, USA,<br>
1967, page 120; wherein composition of chemical backfills for galvanic anodes<br>
has been given. Anode resistivity very mush depends on the composition. A<br>
backfill composed of 75% hydrated graphite, 20% bentonite clay and 5% sodium<br>
sulphate has been mentioned. The main draw back of this backfill is that being in<br>
powder form, it is rather difficult to prevent leaching in soil in spite of confining the<br>
backfill in a bag. Further such backfills cannot be retained easily on a concrete<br>
surface. Intimate contact cannot be ensured at all seasons particularly during<br>
summer.<br>
Reference may be made to Jack Bennett and Clim Fir lotte, Materials<br>
Performance Volume 36 March 1997, pp 14-20; wherein adhesive type of acrylic<br>
hydro gel has been evaluated for use in reinforced concrete structure. The main<br>
drawback of this hydro gel is that the gel must be prevented from direct contact<br>
with water or seawater by caulking the edge. This is not a practicable feature. It<br>
is often difficult to prevent exchange of water with the environment. Their studies<br>
have further revealed that the developed hydro gel system was best suited to be<br>
used with pure zinc as the sacrificial anode. Their studies have also shown that<br>
hydro gel adhesives available for medical applications are not satisfactory for<br>
cathodic protection of reinforced concrete structures.<br>
Reference may be made to R.J. Kassler R.G. Powers and I.R. Lasa<br>
Materials Performance vol 37, January 1998, pp 12-16; wherein the performance<br>
of zinc sheet anodes with another vinyl type sheet material with an adhesive<br>
compound on both sides has been reported. The main draw back of this system<br>
is that there is wide variation in the performance. Another limitation is that the<br>
performance of this vinyl type sheet material system has been evaluated on zinc<br>
sheet anode system only.<br>
The hydro gels, hitherto used for cathodic protection of concrete structure<br>
involved the use of classical polymer gels mainly of simple vinyl system as back<br>
filler whose inherent water contact in the gelated physico - chemical structure<br>
has provided necessary ionic conducting path ways in the electrochemical cell<br>
configuration providing the protective system. Further, this requires a coverage<br>
on both sides to prevent transport of moisture laterally.<br>
To overcome these major drawbacks there is a definite need for providing<br>
a novel backfill material. Particularly an efficient ion conductive backfill, notably<br>
proton conducting backfill, in sheet form based on polymer which is hitherto been<br>
unknown in the prior art.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel proton conductive polymer gel useful as backfill for<br>
sacrificial and impressed current anode system, which obviates the drawbacks<br>
as detailed above.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a novel proton conductive<br>
polymer backfill in sheet form, which can be conveniently inserted at<br>
anode/concrete interface.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel backfill system<br>
such that its functioning is independent of anode system.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a novel backfill whose<br>
functioning will not be adversely affected by direct contact with moisture, on the<br>
other hand its efficiency will increase in presence of moisture.<br>
The process of the present invention provides for the manufacture of a novel<br>
proton conductive polymer gel useful as backfill for sacrificial and impressed<br>
current anode systems The process of the present invention is carried out in<br>
aqueous phase thus providing a cheaper option besides the use of ingredients<br>
readily available in the international markets. The polymer used as backfill is<br>
transformed into a proton conducting form in the gelated network through an insitu<br>
doping process during gelation. The gel product produced can be sliced to<br>
sheet of any desired size suitable and compatible to concrete or soil medium.<br>
The novelty of the product of the present invention is that it can be used as<br>
backfill between any anode such as sacrificial or impressed current mode and is<br>
adaptable to the concrete surface both in the presence of moisture or absence of<br>
moisture, which is not hitherto been achieved in prior art. Further, the specialty of<br>
the utility of this product, is its compatibility with all the sacrificial anodes such<br>
Mg, Al, Zn which is not hitherto been realized with any of the earlier chemical<br>
backfill known for this application.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the manufacture<br>
of a novel proton conductive polymer gel useful as backfill for sacrificial and<br>
impressed current anode systems, which comprises preparing an aqueous<br>
solution consisting of a gel forming structure such as acrylic family of monomers<br>
of concentration in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mole %, an amide or sulphonic acid<br>
group either alone or in combination in the range of 0.25 to 0.75 mote % with<br>
respect to monomer concentration and a gelating agent in the range of 0.1 to 0.5<br>
mole % with respect to monomer concentration, adding to the solution so<br>
obtained stoichiometry amounts of dopant such as mineral acid in a ratio of<br>
dopant : monomer in the range of 1:1 to 2:1, followed by adding an oxidizing<br>
agent at 1 to 5 drops / minute, baking the resultant reaction mixture at a<br>
temperature in the range of 75 to 80°C for a period of 100 to 150 minutes,<br>
reducing the temperature to 60 to 65°C and maintaining for a period of 1 to 2<br>
hour to obtain proton conductive polymer gel, subjecting the gel so formed to<br>
multiple washings with water and allowing the washed gel to cool in air, followed<br>
by drying.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the gel forming structure such<br>
as acrylic family of monomers is preferably selected from acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid and derivatives thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the gelating agent is<br>
selected from glutaldehyde, N-N methylene bisacrylamide, glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the dissolution in<br>
water is effected at a temperature in the range of 25 to 30°C under magnetic<br>
stirring.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention stoichiometry amounts<br>
of mineral acid such as HfeSQ*. HC!, HaPC^, HBF4 is added and mixed for a period<br>
in the range of 30 to 60 minutes.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention the oxidizing agent<br>
H202 is preferably used as drops whose addition is regulated over a period of<br>
time in the range of 30-60 minutes.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the proton conducting<br>
polymer gel is subjected to multiple washings with around 250 ml of water per<br>
gram of gel.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention the final polymer gel<br>
product obtained is a proton having conductivity of the order of 10'2-10"3S/cm.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a novel<br>
proton conductive polymer gel useful as backfill for sacrificial and impressed<br>
current anode systems, which is unknown in the hitherto known prior art. The<br>
process comprises preparing an aqueous solution of a gel forming sructure,<br>
preferably from acrylic family of monomers, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid<br>
and derivatives thereof, of concentration in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mole %, with<br>
amide or sulfonic acid group either alone or in combination of concentration in<br>
the range of 0.25 to 0.75 mole % with respect to monomer concentration, and a<br>
gelating agent, such as glutaldehyde, N-N methylene bisacrylamide, glycidyl<br>
methacrylate, in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mole % with respect to monomer<br>
concentration. All these components are dissolved at a dissolution temperature<br>
of 25 to 30°C under magnetic stirring, followed by the addition of dopant in<br>
stoichiometry amounts of mineral acid such as HfeSO^ HCI, H3PO4, HBF4 and<br>
mixed for a period in the range of 30 to 60 minutes. The ratio of dopant :<br>
monomer being in the range of 1:1 to 2:1. Adding oxidizing agent such as H202<br>
at a rate ranging from 1 to 5 drops per minute regulated over a period of time in<br>
the range of 30-60 minutes. The entire reaction mixture so obtained is placed in<br>
an oven for baking at a temperature in the range of 75 to 80°C for a period of 100<br>
to 150 minutes to initiate doping and simultaneous gelation. This is followed by<br>
reducing the temperature to 60 to 65°C and maintaining for a period of 1 to 2<br>
hour to obtain proton conductive polymer gel1. Subjecting the gel so formed to<br>
multiple washings with around 250 ml of water per gram of gel and allowing the<br>
washed gel to cool in air, followed by drying. After drying the gel so formed can<br>
be sliced to sheet of any desired size for evaluation in concrete or soil medium<br>
sructure.<br>
The whole operation of the process of the present invention is carried out<br>
in aqueous phase thus providing a cheaper option besides the use of ingredients<br>
readily available in the international markets. Also the gel product produced can<br>
be sliced to sheet of any desired size suitable and compatible to concrete or soil<br>
medium. The novelty of the product of the present invention is that it can be<br>
used as backfill between any anode such as sacrificial or impressed current<br>
mode and is adaptable to the concrete surface both in the presence of moisture<br>
or absence of moisture, which is not hitherto been achieved in prior art.<br>
Moreover, the polymer used as backfill is transformed into a proton conducting<br>
form in the gelated network through an in-situ doping process during gelation<br>
specifically for the said application. Thus this product is specifically customized<br>
through this inventive process specific to the application mentioned namely<br>
concrete surface and the soil medium and the product is first of its kind in the<br>
application of cathodic protection of concrete surface. Further, the specialty of<br>
the utility of this product, its compatibility with all the sacrificial anodes such Mg,<br>
Al, Zn which is not hitherto been realized with any of the earlier chemical backfill<br>
known for this application.<br>

titanium substrate insoluble anode was been employed. The experiments as<br>
carried out are detailed in the examples below.<br>
Example-7<br>
Sustainability of polarization shift-evaluation in sand medium with magnesium<br>
anode.<br>
Washed and dried river sand was mixed with distilled water containing<br>
1500 ppm of chloride so as to make a workable mixture. This semi-solid mixture<br>
was packed tightly in a non-metallic container of size 20x20x1 Ocm. Two<br>
numbers of cold twisted mild steel reinforcement rods (8mm dia and 10cm long)<br>

Trichloroethylene. Electrical leads were taken from one end. The reinforcement<br>
rods were embedded at a depth of 8 cm from the top surface. The horizontal<br>
spacing between the rods was maintained at 8 cm. Simultaneously an<br>
embeddable reference electrode was buried horizontally between the two rods.<br>
An inter electrode spacing was maintained at 0.5 cm. The open circuit potential<br>
of steel was monitored over a period of 120 minutes. Subsequently a<br>
magnesium-based anode of size 5x3 cm was placed on the top surface. In one<br>
set of experiment, the newly developed iron conductive polymer backfill of size<br>
50 mm dia and 3 mm thick was inserted at the inter face between the anode<br>
bottom and sand surface. The anode terminal was externally short circuited with<br>
rebar terminals. The potential of the re-bars got shifted in the cathodic direction<br>
and this polarized potential was monitored and recorded upto a period till there<br>
was a considerable decrease in the potential shift.<br>
In another set of experiments, 5 gms of commercially available hydrogel<br>
was applied at the inter face between the anode bottom and the sand surface<br>
and the potential shift was monitored till there was a considerable decrease in<br>
potential shift.<br>
In yet another set of experiments, the standard backfill consisting of 5 gms<br>
of mixtures of bentonite clay (20%) gypsum (75%) and sodium sulfate (5%) was<br>
applied at the interface and the shift in potential monitored till there was a<br>
considerable decrease in potential.<br>
