				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a system for measuring sliding resistance of refractory, ceramic metal products both at cold and high temperatures and especially to a system for use in measuring the abrasion resistance of any solid material both at ambient and high temperatures.<br>
It is well known that different metallurgical furnaces are usually lined with bricks or blocks or castables. Refractory products used for such purpose should have very good high temperature abrasion resistance property. Importantly, the top surface of the refractory products are usually abraded because of sliding effect of molten metal/metal products over such refractory products. It is, therefore, important to determine the abrasion resistance of such lining materials against blasting of solid particles to ascertain the abrasion characteristics of the refractory material used in a particular furnace and its durability.<br>
It is presently known to use standard equipment and method for determining the abrasion resistance of such lining materials as provided and prescribed by British Standard Institution BS 1902 : Section 4.6 : 1985. In this regard reference is invited to the said British Standards wherein there is disclosed an apparatus and method to determine such abrasion resistance. Accompanying figures 1 and 2 illustrates such conventional application used to measure abrasion resistance of materials.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2 the apparatus basically consist of an electric blower with variable transformer control, a calibrated venturi in which the abrasion grain is entrained in an air stream, a manometer, an abrasion chamber incorporating a test piece holder and an exhaust system to recover the abrasive grain. To facilitate the determination of resistance to abrasion using the apparatus, the later is further provided with a balance, scales, drying oven, stop watch, brown fused alumina grain, calibrated carbon blocks as test piece and test sieves. The above apparatus is known for use in determination of abrasion resistance of solid materials following the method of identifying abradibility index of a material (sample) using the standard equation.<br><br>
2<br>
Abradabity index <br>
wherein<br>
m1 - The initial mass of the dried test piece (in g);<br>
 m2 - The mass of the abraded test piece (in g); <br>
Pb - The bulk density of the test piece (m g/cm3) <br>
C - The correction factor<br>
For the purpose of identification of the abradability index, the test pieces/samples are subject to a preparatory exercise wherein test pieces are obtained in the form of rectangular prism to initiate the test operation. The bulk density of each test piece is first determined and then the test pieces are dried to constant mass and thereafter cooled and weighed before abrasion tests are carried out. Thereafter, the test pieces are placed in the holder provided in the unit introduced through the front lid of the unit. Thereafter, securing the lid of the abrasion chamber. The method of abrasion using 6.35 +/- 0.01 kg of dry freshly sieved brown fused alumina grain is conducted on the test sample. After such abrasion is completed, the pieces are finally weighed to determine the extent of abrasion and determine the abradability method following the above equation.<br>
As would be evident from the above established British Standard for measurement of the abradability index ,BS : 1902, such devise and method is not suitable for determining the abrasion resistance against blasting of solid particles at higher temperatures and is restricted to only determination of abrasion resistance against blasting of solid particles at room temperature. Also it is not possible using the above known devise and method of measuring the abrasion resistance of solid particles to measure the abrasion resistance at various temperatures with different sliding rates. Moreover variation in abrasion resistance due to variation in speed of sliding block/abrasive factor is also not known/used following the above known device/method.<br><br>
3<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a system capable of measuring abrasion resistance of any solid material both at room and high temperatures of even upto 1500°C or more.<br>
Another objection of the present invention is directed to provide a system to determine the abrasion resistance index of products at various temperatures with different sliding rates.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide or system for determining the abrasion resistance index of the products at various speed of the sliding block thereby determining the abrasion resistance under varying abrasion conditions.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide for a system for<br>
identification of abrasion resistance index at various loading rates depending on<br>
the type of sample, the loading block, quality and other related parameters.<br>
