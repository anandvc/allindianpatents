				<td>ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS AND METHODS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention rallies to methods for retarding, reducing or otherwise<br>
inhibiting viral growth and/or functional activity. The invention also relates to<br>
compounds and compositions fuitable for use in the methods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently, there is a great need for the development of new treatments that are<br>
effective against viral infections, particularly against viral infections which are<br>
associated with high morbidity and mortality, and which impact on sizable .<br>
populations. Treatments currently available are inadequate or ineffective in large<br>
proportions of infected patients.<br>
For example, in ameliorating AIDS symptoms and prolonging life expectancy, a<br>
measure of success has been achieved with drags targeting the viral reverse<br>
transcriptase and protease enzymes (Miller and Sarver, 1997; Mitsuya, 1992; Moore,<br>
1997; and Thomas and Brady, 1997). However, no single treatment method is<br>
completely effective against HIV infection. (Barry et al, 1998; Deeks, 1998; Miles,<br>
1997; Miles, 1998; Moyle et al, 1998; Rachlis and Zarowny. 1998; Veil et al, 1997;<br>
Volberding and Deeks, 1998; and Volberdin, 1998).<br>
PCT application PCT/AU99/00872 describes the use of compounds 5-(N,N-<br>
hexamethylene)-amiloride and 6-(N,N-imethyl)-amiloride in the treatment of HIV<br>
infection.<br>
Another virus considered to be a significant human pathogen is the Hepatitis C<br>
virus (HCV). This is a significant human pathogen in terms of both cost to human<br>
health and associated economic costs. HCV causes chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis<br>
and is the leading indicator for liver replacement surgery. In 2002 the Centre for<br>
Disease Control and Prevention estimated that more-than 4 million people were<br>
infected in the USA alone and that approximately 8,000 to 10,000 die as a result of<br>
chronic HCV infection yearly. There is no known cure or vaccine. More effective<br>
pharmacological agents are urgently required.<br><br>
A further well-known family of pathogenic viruses are the Coronaviruses.<br>
Coronaviruscs (Order Nidovirctes. family Coronaviridae, Genus Coronavirus) are<br>
enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum-<br>
Goigi intermediate compartment or the cis-Golgi network (Fischer, Stegen et al.<br>
1998; Maeda, Maeda et al. 1999; Corse and Machamer 2000; Maeda, Repass et al.<br>
2001; Kuo and Masters 2003).<br>
Coronaviruses infect humans and animals and it is thought that there could be<br>
a coronavirus that infects every animal. The two human coronaviruses, 229E and<br>
OC43, are known to be the major causes of the common cold and can occasionally<br>
cause pneumonia in older adult, neonates, or immunocompromised patients (Peiris,<br>
Lai et al. 2003). Animal coronaviruses can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal,<br>
neurological, or hepatic diseases in their host (Peiris, Lai et al. 2003). Several animal<br>
coronavirus are significant veteinary pathogens (Rota, Obcrste ct al. 2003).<br>
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly identified<br>
virus. SARS is a respiratory illness that has recently been reported in Asia, North<br>
America, and Europe (Peiris, Lai et al. 2003). The causative agent of SARS was<br>
identified as a coronavirus. (Dnosten, Gunther et al. 2003; Ksiazek, Erdman et al.<br>
2003; Peiri3, Lai et al. 2003). The World Health Organization reports that the<br>
cumulative number of reported probable cases of SARS from 1 November 2002 to<br>
the 11 July 2003 is 8,437 with 813 deaths, nearly a 10% death rate. It is believed<br>
that SARS will not be eradicatec, but will cause seasonal epidemics like the.cold or<br>
influenza viruses (Vogel 2003).<br>
To improve the prospect of treating and preventing viral infections, there is an<br>
on-going need to identify molecules capable of inhibiting various aspects of the viral<br>
life cycle.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of<br>
the disadvantages of the prior art or to provide a useful alternative.<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be<br>
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of<br>
common general knowledge in ft e field.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that certain compounds that fell under<br>
the classification of substitufrid acylguaniduies have antiviral activity against viruses<br>
fiora a range of different vim s families. Without intending to be bound by any<br>
particular theory or mechanism of action, and despite current dogma, it appears<br>
possible that viral replication can be retarded by inhibiting or otherwise down-<br>
regulating the activity of ion channels expressed in the host cell. Thus, the negative<br>
impact of the compounds of the present invention on viral replication may be<br>
mediated by the inhibition or otherwise down-regulation of a membrane ion channel<br>
relied upon by the virus for replication. This membrane ion channel may be a viral<br>
membrane ion channel (exogenous to the host cell) or a host cell ion channel induced<br>
as a result of viral infection (endogenous to the host cell).<br>
As an example, the compounds Of the present invention may inhibit Vpu or p7<br>
function and thereby inhibit the continuation of the respective HTV or HCV life cycle.<br>
The S ARS virus encodes an E protein which is shown for the first time, by the<br>
present inventors, to act as an ion channel. As similar E proteins are present in other<br>
coronaviruses, the compound;, compositions and metiiods of the present invention<br>
would have utility in the inhibition and/or treatment of infections by other<br>
coronaviruses.<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel antiviral compounds that fall<br>
under, the classification of sutstituted acylguanidines. It does not include in its scope<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of plasmids used for expression of Vpu in<br>
E. coli. A. The amino acid sequence (  1) encoded by the vpu open reading<br>
frame (ORF) generated by PCR from an HIV-1 strain HXB2 cDNA clone. The vpu<br>
ORF was cloned in-frame at tie 31 end of the GST gene in p2GEX to generate<br>
p2GEXVpu (B). It was subsequently cloned into pPL451 to produce the plasmid pPL<br>
+ Vpu (C).<br>
Figure 2 is a photographic representation of the expression and purification of Vpu in<br>
E. coli. A. Western blotting after SDS-PAGE was used to detect expressed Vpu in E,<br>
coli extracts. Lanes 1-4 contain samples, at various stages of purity, of Vpu expressed<br>
from p2GEXVpu: lane 1, GST-Vpu fusion protein isolated by glutathione-agarose<br>
affinity chromatography; lane 2, Vpu liberated from the fusion protein by treatment<br>
with thrombin; lane 3, Vpu purified by HPLC anion exchange chromatography; Iane<br>
4, Vpu after passage through, the immunoaffinity column. Lanes 5 and 6, membrane<br>
vesicles prepared from 42'C incluced cells containing pPL+Vpu or pPL451,<br>
respectively. B. Silver stained SDS-PAGE gel: Iane 1, Vpu purified by HPLC anion<br>
exchange chromatography; Iane 2, Vpu after passage through the immunoaffinity<br>
column.<br>
Figure 3 is a graphical representation of ion channel activity observed after exposure<br>
of lipid bilayers to aliquots containing purified Vpu. In A and B, the CIS chamber<br>
contained 500mM NaCl and the TRANS chamber contained 50mM NaCl; both<br><br>
solutions were buffered at pH 6.0 with 10 mM MES. B shows a current versus<br>
voltage curve generated from data similar to that shown in A.<br>
Figure 4 is a photographic representation of bacterial cross-feeding assays. For all<br>
plates, the Met, Pro- auxotrophic strain was used to seed a soft agar overlay. Plates A<br>
. and B contain minimal drop -out medium minus proline; in plate C the medium was<br>
minus methionine. To control for viability of the cells in the background lawn, the<br>
discs labelled P and M contained added proline or methionine, respectively. The discs<br>
labelled C and V were inocu lated with Met4, Pro+ B. coli cells containing the<br>
plasmids pPL451 or pPL+Vpu, respectively.' Plates were incubated at 37oC (A and C)<br>
or 30°C (B) for two days and photographed above a black background with peripheral<br>
illumination from, a fluorescent light located below the plate. The images were<br>
recorded on a Novaline video gel documentation system. Light halos around the discs<br>
labelled P or M on all plates .and around the disc labelled V on plate A indicate<br>
growth of the background lawn strain<br>
Figure 5 is a graphical representation of the. screening of drugs for potential Vpu<br>
channel blockers. The photograph shows a section of a minimal medium-lacking<br>
adenine - agarose plate onto, which a lawn of XL-I-blue E. coli cells containing the<br>
Vpu expression plasmid pPLVpu has been seeded. Numbers 6-11 are located at the<br>
sites of application of various drugs being tested, which were applied in 3^1 drops and<br>
allowed to soak into the agarose. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 4Shr prior<br>
to being photographed. The background grey shade corresponds to areas of no<br>
bacterial growth. The bright circular area around " 10" represents bacterial cell<br>
growth as a result of application of adenine at that location (positive control). The<br>
smaller halo of bacterial growth around "9" is due to the application of 5-CN.N-<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based, in part, on the surprising determination that<br>
certain compounds that fell under the classification of substituted acylguanidines have<br>
antiviral activity against viruses from a range of different virus families. Without<br>
intending to be bound by any particular theory or mechanism of action, the negative<br>
impact of the compounds of the present invention on viral replication may be<br>
mediated by the inhibition or otherwise down-regulation of a membrane ion channel<br>
relied upon by the virus for replication. This membrane ion channel may be a viral<br>
membrane ion channel (exogeaous to the host cell) or a host cell ion channel induced<br>
as a result of viral infection (endogenous to the host cell).<br>
As an example, the compounds of the present invention may inhibit Vpu or p7<br>
function and thereby inhibit the continuation of the respective HIV or HCV life cycle.<br>
The SARS virus encodes an E protein which is shown for the first time, by the<br>
present inventors, to act as an ion channel As similar E proteins are present in other<br>
coronaviruses, the compounds, compositions and methods of the present invention<br>
would have utility in the inhibition and/or treatment of infections by other<br>
coronaviruses.<br>
While the present inversion is concerned with novel antiviral compounds<br>
falling under the classification of substituted acylguanidines, it does not include in its<br>
scope the use of compounds 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)armiloride and 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-<br>
amiloride for retarding, reducing or otherwise inhibiting viral growth and/or<br>
functional activity of HIV.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the<br>
invention may be administered ia the form of a composition or formulation<br>
comprising pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise one or<br>
more known antiviral compounds or molecules. Preferably, the known antiviral<br>
compounds are selected from the group consisting of Vidarabine, Acyclovir,<br>
Ganciclovir, Valganciclovir, Valacyclovir, Cidofovir, Famciclovir, Ribavirin,<br><br>
Amantadine, Rimantadine, Interferon, Oseltamivir, Palrvizumab, Rimantadine,<br>
Zanarnivir, nucleoside-analo greverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) such as<br>
Zidovudine, Didanosine, Zaloitabine, Stavudine, Lamivudme and Abacavir, non-<br>
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitora (NNRTI) such as NeYiiapine, Delavirdine<br>
and Efavirenz, protease inhibitors such as Saquinavir, Ritonavir, Indinavir,<br>
Nelfinavir, Amprenavir, and other known antiviral compounds and preparations.<br>
Known antiviral compounds or molecules may in some cases act synergistically with<br>
the antiviral compounds of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present observations and findings now permit the use of agents such as<br>
certain substituted acylguani dines, as anti-viral agents for the therapy and prophylaxis<br>
of viral conditions caused by different viruses. The methods and compositions of the<br>
present invention may be par ticulariy effective against viruses which rely on ion<br>
channel formation for their replication, however it will be understood that this is not<br>
the only mechanism relied on by viruses tor replication and that the compounds and<br>
methods of the present invention are not limited to agents which exert their action by<br>
retarding or inhibiting the function of ion channels.<br>
Reference to."membranetion channel" should be understood as a reference to a<br>
structure which transports ions across a membrane. The present invention extends to<br>
ion channels which may function by means such as passive, osmotic, active or<br>
exchange transport. The ion channel may be formed by intracellular or extracellular<br>
, means, For example, the.ion chamel maybe an ion channel which is naturally formed<br>
by a cell to facilitate its normal functioning, Alternatively, the ion channel may be<br>
formed by extracellular means. Extracellular means would include, for example, the<br>
formation of ion channels due to introduced chemicals, drugs or other agents such as<br>
ionophores or due to the functional activity of viral proteins encoded by a virus which<br>
has entered a cell.<br>
The ion channels which ire the subject of certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention facilitate the transport of ions across membranes. Said membrane maybe<br>
any membrane and is not Iimi:ed to the outer cell wall plasma membrane.<br>
Accordingly, "membrane" as used herein encompasses the membrane surrounding<br>
any cellular organelle, such as the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, the<br>
outer cell membrane, the membrane surrounding any foreign antigen which is located<br>
within the cell (for example, a viral envelope) or the membrane of a foreign organism<br>
which is located extracellularly. The membrane is typically, but not necessarily,<br>
composed of a fluid lipid bilayer. The subject ion channel may be of any structure.<br>
For example, the Vpu ion chat cnel is formed by Vpu which is an integral membrane<br>
protein encoded by HIV-1 which associates with, for example, the Golgi and<br>
endoplasmic reticulum membr anes of infected cells. Reference hereinafter to "Vpu<br><br>
ion channels" is a reference tc all related ion channels for example P7 HCV and M2<br>
of influenza and the like.<br>
Reference to "HIV", "SARS" Coranavirus" or "HCV" should he understood as<br>
a reference to any HIV, SARS, Coronavirus or HCV virus strain and including<br>
homologues and mutants.<br>
Reference to the "functional activity of an ion channel should he understood as<br>
a reference to any one or mon: of the functions which an ion channel performs or is<br>
involved in. For example, the Vpu protein encoded ion. channel, in addition to<br>
facilitating the transportation of Na+, K+ CI and PO43', also plays a role in the '<br>
degradation of the CD4 molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum. Without wishing to<br>
be hound by a particular theory, the Vpu protein encoded ion channel is also thought<br>
to play a role in mediating the HIV life cycle. The present invention is not limited to<br>
treating HIV infection via the mechanism of inhibiting the HIV life cycle and, in<br>
particular, HIV replication. Rather, the present invention should be understood to<br>
encompass anylmrehlaiisrrl bywhicStfie compounds of the present invention exert<br>
their anti-viral activity and may include inhibition of HIV viability or junctional<br>
activity. This also applies to HCV, Coranaviruses, and to other viruses.<br>
Reference to the "functional activity" of a virus should be understood as a<br>
reference to any one or more of the functions which a virus performs or is involved<br>
in.<br>
Reference to the " viral replication" should, he understood to include any one or<br>
more stages or aspects of the viral life cycle, such as inhibiting the assembly or<br>
release of virions. Ion channel mediation of viral replication may be by direct or<br>
indirect means. Said ion channel mediation is by direct means if the ion channel<br>
interacts directly with the virion at any one or more of its life cycle stages. Said ion<br>
channel mediation is indirect if it interacts with a molecule other than those of the<br>
virion, which other molecule either directly or indirectly modulates any one or more<br>
aspects or stagey of the viral l)fe cycle. Aixordingly, the method of the present<br>
invention encompasses the mediation of viral replication via the induction of a<br>
cascade of steps which lead tc the mediation of any one or more aspects or stages of<br>
the viral life cycle.<br><br>
Reference to "down-rsgulatizig' ion channel functional activity, should be<br>
understood as a reference to the partial or complete inhibition of any one or more<br>
aspects of said activity by both direct and indirect mechanisms. For example, a<br>
suitable agent may interact directly -with an ion channel to prevent replication of a<br>
virus or, alternatively, may act indirectly to prevent said replication by, for example,<br>
interacting with a molecule other than an ion channel. A further alternative is that<br>
said other molecule interact! with and inhibits the activity of the ion channel.<br>
Screening for molecules that have antiviral activity can be achieved by the range<br>
of methodologies described herein.<br>
. Reference to a "cell" infected with a virus should be understood as a reference to<br>
any cell, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, which has been infected with a virus. This<br>
includes, for example, immatal or primary cell lines, bacterial cultures and cells in<br>
situ. In a suitable screening system for antiviral compounds, the preferred infected<br>
cells would be macrophages/monocytes or hepatocytes/lymphoid cells infected with<br>
- either HIV or HCV respectively.<br>
Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action,<br>
the compounds of the present invention are thought to inhibit viral replication or<br>
virion release from cells by causing ion channels, namely VPU of HIV, the E protein<br>
of SARS and other Coronaviruses, or P7 of HCV to become blocked. The present<br>
invention encompasses antiviral compounds that are substituted acylgnanidines.<br>
The present invention also includes the use of compounds 5-(N,N-<br>
hexamethylene)amilorid9 and 6-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride in the control of viral<br>
replication and/or growth other than HIV.<br>
The subject of the viral inhibition is generally a mammal such as but not<br>
limited to human, primate, livettock animal (e.g. sheep, cow, horse, donkey, pig),<br>
companion animal (e.g. dog, cas:), laboratory test animal (e.g. mouse, rabbit, rat,<br>
guinea pig, hamster), captive wild animal (e.g. fox, deer). Preferably, the subject is a<br>
human or primate. Most preferably, the subject is a human.<br>
The method of the present invention is useful in the treatment and prophylaxis<br>
of viral infection such as, for example, but not limited to HIV infection, HCV<br>
infection and other viral infections. For example, the antiviral activity may be<br>
effected in subjects known to be infected with HIV in order to prevent replication of<br><br>
HIV thereby preventing the onset of AIDS. Alternatively, the method of the present<br>
invention maybe used to reduce serum viral load or to alleviate viral infection<br>
symptoms. Similarly, antivir tf treatment may be effected in subjects known to be<br>
infected with, for example, H 2V, in order to prevent replication of HCV, thereby<br>
preventing the further hepatot yte involvement and the ultimate degeneration of liver<br>
tissue.<br>
The method of the present invention may be particularly useful either in the<br>
early stages of viral infection to prevent the establishment of a viral reservoir in<br>
affected cells or as a prophylactic treatment to be applied immediately prior to or for<br>
a period after exposure to a possible source of virus.<br>
Reference herein to "therapeutic" and "prophylactic" is to be considered in<br>
their broadest contexts. The teim "therapeutic" does not necessarily imply that a<br>
mammal is treated until total recovery. Similarly, "prophylactic" does not necessarily<br>
mean that the subject will not eventually contract a disease condition. Accordingly,<br>
therapy and prophylaxis include amelibration of the symptoms of a particular<br>
condition or preventing or otherwise reducing the risk of developing a particular<br>
condition. The term "prophylaxis" may be considered as reducing the seventy of<br>
onset of a particular condition. Therapy may also reduce the severity of an existing<br>
condition or the frequency of acute attacks.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the present invention, more than one<br>
compound or composition may be co-administered with one or more other<br>
compounds, such as known anti -viral compounds or molecules. By "co-<br>
administered" is meant simultaneous administration in the same formulation or in two<br>
different formulations via the same or different routes or sequential administration by<br>
the same or different routes. By "sequential" administration is meant a time difference<br>
of from seconds, minutes, hours or days between the administration of tha two or<br>
more separate compounds. The subject antiviral compounds may be administered in<br>
any order.<br>
Routes of administration include but are not limited to intravenously,<br>
intraperitionealy, subcutaneously, intracranialy, intradermally, intramuscularly,<br>
intraocularly, intrathecaly, intracsrebrally, intranasally, transmucosally, by infusion,<br><br>
orally, tectally, via iv drip, patch and implant Intravenous routes are particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solntions<br>
(where water soluble) and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of<br>
- sterile injectable solutions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium<br>
containing, for example, wansr, ethanol, poryol (for example, glycerol; propylene<br>
glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof and<br>
vegetable oils. The preventioa of the action of microorganisms can be brought about<br>
by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, calorobutanol,<br>
phenol, sorbic acid, thinnerotial and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to<br>
include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption<br>
of the injectable compositioms can be brought about by the useinlhe compositions of<br>
agents delaying absorption, for example,, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active<br>
compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other<br>
ingredients enumerated abovu, as required, followed by, for example, filter<br>
sterilization or sterilization by other appropriate means. Dispersions are also<br>
contemplated and these may be prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active<br>
ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the<br>
required other ingredients fron those enumerated above. In the case of sterile<br>
powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, a preferred method of<br>
preparation includes vacuum frying and the freeze-drying technique which yield a<br>
powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a<br>
previously sterile-filtered solution.<br>
When the active ingredients are suitably protected, they maybe orally<br>
administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier,<br>
or it may be. enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or it may be compressed'<br>
into tablets. For oral therapeu ;ic administration, the active compound may be<br>
incorporated with excipients iind used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets,<br>
troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such<br>
compositions and preparation 5 should contain at least 0.01 % by weight, more<br>
preferably 0.1% by weight, even more preferably 1% by weight of active compound.<br><br>
The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and<br>
may conveniently "be between about 1 to about 99%, more preferably about 2 to about<br>
90 %, even more preferably about 5 to about 80% of the weight of the unit The<br>
amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions in such that a<br>
suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions or preparations according to<br>
the present invention are prepared so that an oral dosage unit form contains between<br>
about 0.1 ng and 2000 mg of autive compound.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the<br>
components as listed hereafter, A binder such as gum, acacia, com starch or gelatin;<br>
excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as com starch,<br>
potato starch, atginic acid and he like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a<br>
sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring<br>
agent such as peppermint, oil c f wintergreen, or cherry flavouring. "When the dosage<br>
unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a<br>
liquid carrier. Various timer materials may be present as coatings of to otherwise<br>
modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules<br>
may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A Syrup or elixir may contain the active<br>
compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as<br>
preservatives, a dye and flavouring such as cherry ox orange flavour. Any material<br>
used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceuticaliy pure and<br>
substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound(s)<br>
may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations.<br>
The present invention ttlso extends to forms suitable for topical application<br>
such as creams, lotions and gel 3. In such forms, the anti-clotting peptides may need to<br>
be modified to permit penetrati on of the surface barrier. Procedures for the<br>
preparation of dosage unit forms and topical preparations are readily available to<br>
those skilled in the art from texts such as Pharmaceutical Handbook A Martinddle<br>

PhannaceuticaHy acctsptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all<br>
solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and<br>
absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for<br>
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any<br>
conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, use thereof in<br>
the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can<br>
also be incorporated into the compositions. .<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage'<br>

used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the<br>
mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of<br>
active material calculated/to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with<br>
therequired pharmaceutical carier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms'<br>
of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique<br>
characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be<br>
achieved and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding.<br>

The methods of the present invention, is useful in the treatment and<br>
prophylaxis of viral infection such as, for example, but not limited to HIV infection,<br>
HCV infection and other viral infections. For example, the antiviral activity may be.<br><br>
effected in subjects Imown to be infected with HIV in order to prevent replication of<br>
HIV thereby preventing the onset of AIDS. Alternatively, the methods of the present<br>
invention maybe used to recitce serum viral load or to alleviate viral infection<br>
symptoms. Similarly, antiviral treatment may be effected in subjects known to be<br>
infected with, for example, ECV, in order to prevent replication of HCV, thereby<br>
preventing the furiher.hepato syte involvement and the ultimate degeneration of liver<br>
tissue.<br>
The methods of the present invention may be particularly useful either in the<br>
early stages of viral infection to prevent the establishment of a viral reservoir in<br>
affected cells or as aprophylastic treatment to be applied immediately prior to or for<br>
a period after exposure to a possible source of virus.<br>
The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to<br>
specific but non-limiting examples describing studies of viral membrane ion channels<br>
and screening for antiviral activity. Some examples involve the use of the SARS<br>
virus. It will be clear from the description herein that other lehtiviruses, and<br>
coronaviruses and other compounds may be used effectively in the context of the<br>
present invention. It is to be understood, however, that the detailed description is<br>
included solely for the purpose of exemplifying the present invention. It should not be<br>
understood in any way as a resbiction on the broad description of the invention, as set<br>
out above.<br>
Example 1. Synthesis of the Compounds of the Invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be made from the corresponding<br>
acid chlorides or methyl esters as: shown in Scheme 1. Both of these methods are well<br>
described in the literature..<br><br><br><br>
To a solution of trans-cinnamic acid (1.50 g, 10.12 mmol) in dry benzene<br>
(30mL) containing a drop of N,J V^imemylformamide was added oxalyl chloride<br>
(5.14 g, 40.5 ramol) causing the solution to effervesce. After refluxing for 2 h, the<br>
solution was evaporated to drynsss under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was<br>
dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (20mL) and added slowly to a solution of guanidine<br>
hydrochloride in 2M aqueous sodium hydroxide (25mL). The reaction was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 1h then extracted with ethyl acetate (3x50mL). The combined<br>
extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give an orange oil. The<br>
crude product was purified by column chromatography. Elution with 10% to 20%<br>
methanol in dichloromethane gave Cinamoylguanidine as a cream solid (0.829 g,<br>
43%).<br><br>
To a solution of methyl 3-amino-5,6-dichloro-2-pyrazinecarboxylate (0.444 g,<br>
2.0 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) / water (10 mL) / toluene (20 mL) was added<br>
phenyl boronic acid (0.536 g, 4.4 mmol),. sodium carbonate (0.699 g, 6.6 mmol) and<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium(0) (0.116g, 0.10 mmol). The reaction was<br><br>
evacuated and purged with nitrogen several times before being refluxed for 6 h. The<br>
organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer extracted with toluene (3 x 20 mL).<br>
The combined organic extracs were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure to give methyl 3-amino-6-chloro-5-<br>
phenyl-2-pyrazinecarboxylate as a yellow solid (0.43 g, 82%).<br><br>
To a solution of sodiutl (0.040 g, 1.74 mmol) dissolved in methanol (5 mL)<br>
was added guanidine hydmchloridfi (0.258 g, 2.70 mmol) and the mixture refluxed<br>
for 30 min after which it was filtered. To the filtrate was added methyl 3-amin0'6-<br>
cb1oro-5-pnenyl-2-pyrazinecarboxylate (6.264g, 1.0 mmol) in N,N-<br>
dimediyiformamide (5 mL) and the solution heated at 75oC for 12 h. The solvent was<br>
removed under reduced pressure and the residue chromatographed on silica gel<br>
eluting with 1% triethylamine 5% methanol / dichloromethane. The resulting solid<br>
was suspended in chloroform, filtered and dried under high vacuum to give N-<br>
Amidino-3-amino-5-phenyl-6-chloro-2-pyrazinecarboxamide as a yellow solid (0.04<br>
g, 14%).<br>
Example 4.<br><br>
To a solution of methyl 5-armno-5,6-dichloro-2-pyrazmecarboxylate(1.11 g,<br>
5.0 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) was added hexaroemyleneimine (1.49 g, 15.0<br>
mmol) and the reaction was refluxed for 1 h. The reaction was allowed to cool and<br>
the solid hexamethyleneimine hydrochlorideremovedby filtration. The filtrate was<br><br><br><br>
To a solution of methyl 3-aniino-6-ohloro-5-hexamethyleneimino-2-<br>
pyrazinecarboxylate (0.350g, 1.23 mmol) in dimethylsutfoxide (5 mL) was added<br>
phenyl boronic acid (0.166 g, 135 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.511 g, 3.70 mmol)<br>
and[1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)feirbcene]dichloropalladium(II)-dichloromethane<br>
complex (0.041 g, 0.05 mmol). The reaction was heated at 90oC for 16 h before being<br>
poured into water (50mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50mL). The combined<br>
extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to give a brown<br>
oil which was purified by chromatography on silica gel. Elution with<br>
dicbloromethane followed by 10% ethyl acetate/dichloromethane gave methyl 3-<br>
amino-5-kexamethyleneimino-6-phenyl-2-pyrazmecarboxylate as a yellow solid<br>
(0.309 g, 77%).<br><br>
To a solution of sodium (0.090 g, 6.17 mmol) dissolved in methanol (8 mL)<br>
was added guanidine hydrochloride (0.598 g, 6.26 mmol) and the mixture was<br>
refiuxed for 30 min after which it was filtered. To the filtrate was added methyl 3-<br>
ammo-5-hexamefhyleneimmo-6-phenyl-2-pyrazniccarboxylate (G.310 g, 0.95 mmol)<br>
in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) and the solution refluxed for 72 h. The solvent was<br>
removed under reduced pressw e and the residue chromatographed on silica gel.<br><br>
Elution with 5% memanol/dihoromethame gave N-amidino-3-amino-5-<br>

varions virus proteins,<br>
Complimentary DNA (cDNA) fragments for the various viral proteins listed<br>
in Table 2 were obtained eitlier by PCR amplification from a parental virus genome<br>
clone, or by direct chemical synthesis of the polynucleotide sequence. For example,<br>
the open reading frame encoding Vpu (Fig la) was amplified by PCR from a cDNA<br>
clone of an Nde I fragment of the HIV-1 genome (isolate HXB2, McFarlane Burnet<br>
Centre, Melbourne, Australia) as follows: Native Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene;<br>
0.035 U//D) was chosen to catalyse the PCS. reaction to minimise possible ?CR<br>
introduced errors by virtue of the enzyme's proofreading activity. The 5\ sense,<br>
primer<br>
AGTAGGATCCATGCAACCTATACC (2) introduces a BamHl site<br>
(underlined) for cloning in-framo with the 3' end of the GST gene in p2GEX (41).<br>
This primer also-repairs the start oodon (bold T replaces a Q of the vpu gene which is<br>
a threonine codonin the HXB2 isolate. The 3', antisense, primer<br>
TCTGGAATTLTACAGATCA1' CAAC ( 3) introduces an EcoRl site<br>
(underlined) to the other end of the PCR product to iacilitate cloning. After 30 cycles<br>
of94°C for 45 sec, 55°C for 1 milL and 72°C for 1 min in 0.5 ml thin-walled<br>
eppendorf tubes in a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler, the 26Sbp fragment was purified,<br>
digested with BamHl and EcoRl and ligated to p2GEX prepared by digestion with the<br>
same two enzymes. The resultant recombinant plasmid is illustrated in Fig lb. The<br>
entireVpu open reading frame and the BamH1 and EcoR1 ligation sites were<br>
sequenced by cycle sequencing, usng the Applied Biosystems dye-terminator kit, to<br>
confirm the DNA sequence. Other cDNAs were synthesised for us using state of the<br>
art methods by GenScript Corporation (New Jersey, USA). Codon sequences were<br>
optimised for expression in bacterial, insect or mammalian cells, as appropriate.<br>
Restriction endonuclease enzyme recognition sites .were incorporated at the 5* and 3'<br><br>
cods of the synthetic cDNAs to facilitate cloning into plasmid expression vectors,<br>
pcDNA3.1,pFastBac and pPL451 for expression of the encoded virus proteins in.<br>
mamma	lian, insect or bacterid cells, respectively.<br>
Standard techniques ofmolecular biology were used in cloning experiments. For<br>
example, to prepare the Vpu open reading frame for insertion into the pPL451<br>
expression plasmid, p2GEXVpu was first digested with BamHI and the 5' base<br>
overhang was filled in the Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTPs. The ,<br>
Vpu-encodtng fragment was then liberated by digestion with EcoRL purified from an<br>
agarose gel and ligated into pPL451 which had been digested with Hpal and EcoRl.<br>
Western blots subsequently confirmed that the pPLVpu construct (Fig 1c) expressed<br>
Vpu after induction of cultures at 42°C to inactivate the cIS57 repressor of the PR and<br>
PL promoters.<br><br>
Example 6. Purification of Recombinant Vpu from E, Coli<br>
Cultures of E. coli strain XLI-blue cells containing p2GEXVpu were grown at 30oC<br>
with vigorous aeration in LB medium supplemented with glucose (6g/L) and<br>
ampicillion (50mg/L) to a density of approximately 250 Klett units, at which time<br>
IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.01roM and growth was continued for a<br>
further 4hr. The final culture densiy was approximately 280 Klett units. Since early<br>
experiments revealed that the majority of expressed- GST-Vpu fusion protein was<br>
associated with both the cell debris and 30 membrane fractions, the method of<br>
Varadhachary and Moloney (Varadhachary and Maloney, 1990) was adopted to<br>
isolate osmotically disrupted cell ghosts (combining both cell debris and membrane<br>
fractions) for the. initial purification steps. Cells were harvested, washed, weighed and<br><br>
resuspended to 10ml/g wet weight in MTPBS containing DTT (ImM) and MgCl2<br>
(10mM). Lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml; chicken egg white; Sigma) was added and incubated<br>
on ice for 30 min with gentle agitation followed by 5 min at 37°C. The osmotically<br>
sensitised eells were pelleted itt 12,000g and resuspended to the original volume in<br>
water to burst the cells. The suspension was then made up to 1xMTPBS/DTT using a<br>
10x buffer stock and the ghosts: were isolated by cenoifugation and resuspended in<br>
MTPBS/DTT to which was then sequentially added glycerol (to 20 % wt/vol) and<br>
CHAPS (to 2 % wt/vol) to give a final volume of one quarter the original volume.<br>
This mixture was stirred on ice for 1hr and then centrifuged at 400,000g for 1hr to<br>
remove insoluble material. The GST-Vpu fusion protein was purified from the<br>
detergent extract by affinity chromatography on a glutathione agarose resin (Sigma).<br>
The resin was thoroughly washed in 50mM Tris pH 7.5 containing glycerol (5 %),<br>
DTT (ImM), and CHAPS (0,5 %) (Buffer A) andthen the Vpu portion of the fusion<br>
protein was liberated and eluted from the resin-bound GST by treatment of a 50%<br>
(v/v) suspension bf the beads with human fhrombm(100U/ml; 37°C for 1hr). PMSF .<br>
(0.5mM) was added to the eluant to eliminate any remaining thrombin activity. This<br>
Vpu fraction was further purified on a column of MA.7Q anion exchange resin<br>
attached to a BioRad HPLC and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-2M) in buffer<br>
A.<br>
The Vpu was purified to homogeneity - as determined on silver stained gels - on an<br>
immunoaffinity column as follows: HPLC fractions containing Vpu were desalted on<br>
a NAP 25 column (Pharmacia) into buffer A and then mixed with the antibody-<br>
agarose beads for Ihr at room tei operature. The beads were washed thoroughly and<br>
Vpu was eluted by increasing tha salt concentration to 2M. Proteia was quantitated<br>
using the BioRad dye binding assay-<br>
Example 7. Expression and Pgrificatiott of Vpu in E,Coli<br>
The piasmid p2GEXVpu (Fig. 1) was constructed to create an in-frame gene fusion<br>
between the GST and Vpu open-reading frames. This system enabled IPTG-inducible<br>
expression of the Vpu polypeptide fused to the C-terrninus of GST and allowed<br>
purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose..<br><br>
Optimal levels of GST-Vpu expression were obtained by growing the cultures at<br>
30°C to a cell density of approximately 250-300 Klett units and' inducing with low<br>
levels of 1PTG (0.01mM). To purify the GST-Vpu, a combined cellular fraction<br>
containing the cell debris and plasma membrane was prepared by lysozyme treatment<br>
of the induced cells followed by a low-speed centrifugation. Approximately 50% of<br>
the GST-Vpu protein could bs solubilised from this fraction using the zwitterionic<br>
detergent CHAPS. Affinity chiomatography using glutathione-agarose beads was<br>
used to enrich the fusion proteia andthrombin was used to cleave the fusion protein<br>
at the high affinity thrombin she between the fusion partners, liberating Vpn (Fig.<br>
2A). In fractions eluted from the anion exchange column Vpu was the major protein<br>
visible on silver stained gels (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Finally, Vpu was purified to apparent<br>
homogeneity on an immunoaffnity column (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The N-terminal amino<br>
acid'sequence of the protein band (excised from SDS-PAGE gels) corresponding to<br>
the immunodetected protein confirmed its identity as Vpu.<br>
Example 8. Reconstitution of Vpu in Phospholipid Vesicles.<br>
Proteoliposornes containing Vpu were prepared by the detergent dilution method<br>
(New, 1990). A mixture of lipids (PE:PC:PS; 53:2; Img total lipid) dissolved in<br>
chloroform was dried under a stceam of nitrogen gas and resuspendedin 0.1 ml of<br>
potassium-phosphate buffer (50mM pH 7.4) containing DTT (ImM). A 25ul aliquot<br>
containing purified Vpu was adcted, followed by octylglucoside to a final<br>
concentration of 1.25 % (wt/vol). This mixture was subject to three rounds of<br>
freezing in liquid nitrogen, thawing and sonication in a bath type sonicator (20-30<br>
sec) and was then rapidly diluted into 200 volumes of the potassium phosphate buffer.<br>
Proteoliposornes were collected by centrifugation at 400,000g for lbr and resuspended<br>
in approximately 150ui of phosphate buffer.<br>
Example 9. Assaying Vpn Ion Channel Activity<br>
Purified Vpu was tested ibr its ability to induce channel activity in planar lipid<br>
bilayers using standard techniques as described elsewhere (Miller, 1986; and Piller et<br>
al, 1996). The solutions in the C3S and TRANS chambers were separated by a<br>
Delrin™ plastic wall containing a small circular hole of approximately 100µm<br><br>
diameter across wnicn a lipid bilayer was painted so as to form a high resistance<br>
electrical seal. Bilayers were painted from a mixture (8:2) of pahnitoyl-oleoly-<br>
phosphatidyl-emanolaniine and pahnitoyl-oleolyphosphatidyl-choline (Avanti Polar<br>
Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama) in n-decane. The solutions in the two chambers<br>
contained MES buffer (10mM, pH 6.0) to which various NaCl or KCl concentrations<br>
were added. Currents were recorded with an Axopatch™ 200 amplifier. The electrical<br>
potential between the two chambers could be manipulated between +/-200mV<br>
(TRANS relative to grounded CIS). Aliquots containing Vpu were added to the CIS<br>
chamber either as a detergent iolution or after incorporation of the protein into<br>
! phospholipid vesicles; The chamber was stirred until currents were observed.<br>
Example 10. Vpu Forms Ion Channels in Lipid Bilayers.<br>
To assay for ion:channt:l formation by Vpu, reconstitution into planar lipid<br>
bilayers was performed. When samples (containing between 7 and 70ng of protein) of<br>
purified recombinant Vpu were added to the 1ml of buffer in the CIS chamber of the<br>
bilayer apparatus, current fluctuations were detected after periods of stirring that<br>
varied from 2 to 30 min (Fig. 3). This time taken to observe channel activity "<br>
approximately correlated with the amount of protein added to the chamber. No<br>
channels were detected when control buffer aliquots or control lipid vesicles were<br>
added to the CIS chamber. la those control experiments the chambers could be stirred<br>
for more than an hour without abearance of channel activity.<br>
Example 11. Properties of The Vpu Channels.<br>
Channel activity was obs srved in over 40 individual experiments with Vpu<br>
. samples prepared from five independent purifications. In different experiments, the<br>
amplitude of the currents varied over a large range and, again, seemed to<br>
approximately correlate with the amount of protein added. The smallest and largest<br>
channels measured had conductances of 14 pS and 280 pS, respectively. The channels<br>
were consistently smaller when lipid vesicles containing Vpu were prepared and<br>
fused to the bilayer rather than when purified protein in detergent solution.was added.<br>
This may be because the former method included treatment with high concentrations<br>
of detergent and a dilution step that may have favoured the breakdown of large<br>
aggregates into monomers.<br><br>
Hie relationship between current amplitude and voltage was linear and the<br>
reversal potential in solutions containing atea-fold gradient of NaCl (500mM CIS;<br>
50mM TRANS) was +3GmV (Fig. 3B). A similar reversal potential was obtained<br>
when solutions contained K.(2 instead of NaCl. In 5 experiments with either NaCl or<br>
KCI in the solutions on either side of the membrane, the average reversal potential<br>
was 31.0 +/-1.2mV (+/-SEM). This is more negative than expected for a channel<br>
selectively permeable for the cations alone. Using ion activities in the Goldman-<br>
Hodgkin-Katz equation give s a Pjfe/Pd ratio of about 5-5 indicating that the channels<br>
are also permeable to chloride ions. An attempt was made to reduce the anion current<br>
by substituting phosphate for chloride ions. When- a Na-phosphate gradient (150mM<br>
Na+ &amp; 100mM phosphate CIS; 15mM Na+ &amp; 10mM phosphate TRANS, pH 6.8) was<br>
used instead of the NaCl gradient, the reversal potential was 37.1 +/- 0.2 (+/-SEM,<br>
n-2) again indicating a cation/anion permeability ratio of about 5. (For calculations<br>
involving the phosphate solutions, the summed activities of the mono and bivalent<br>
- anions were used and it was assumed that the two species were equally permeable). -<br>
The current-voltage curve now exhibited rectification that was not seenin the NaCl<br>
solutions. It can be concluded that the channels formed by Vpu are equally permeably<br>
to Na4" and K* and are also parmgable* though to a lesser' extent} to chloride as well as<br>
phosphate ions.<br>
Example 12. Bacterial Bio -Assay for Screening Potential Ion Channel-Blocking<br>
Drags.<br>
This bio-assay is basud on the observation that expression of Vpu in &amp; colt<br>
results in an active Vpu charnel located in the plasmalemmathat dissipates the<br>
transmembrane sodium gradient. As a consequence of this Vpu channel activity,<br>
metabolites whose accumulation within the cells is mediated by a sodium dependent<br>
co-transporter (for example proline or adenine) leak out of the cell faster than they<br>
canbe synthesised so that the metabolites' intracellular levels become limiting for<br>
growth of the cell. Thereby, an E. coli cell expressing Vpu is unable to grow hi<br>
minimal drop-out media lading adenine or proline. However, in the presence of a<br>
drug that blocks the Vpu channel, the cell is once again able to re-establish its<br>
transmembrane sodium gradient - due to the action of other ion pumps in the<br>
membrane - and the leakage of metabolites is prevented enabling growth.<br><br>
Experiments to demonstrate that Vpu can form sodium channels in the plasma<br>
membrane of R coH were performed as follows.<br>
To express unfiised Vpu in E. coli, the vpu open-reading frame was cloned<br>
into the plasmid pPL451 to create the recombinant plasmid pPL-Vpu (Fig. lb). la this<br>
vector me strong PL and PR lambda promoters are used to drive expression of Vpn<br>
under control of the temperature sensitive c1857 represser, such that when grown at<br>
30oC expression is tightly repressed and can be induced by raising the temperature to<br>
between 37oC and 42oC. On agar plates, cells containing pPL-Vpu grew when<br>
incubated at 30°C and 37°C but not at 42oC, while control strains grew well at 42°C<br>
Liquid cultures of cells containing pPL-Vpu were grown at 30°C to OD600,=0.84 then<br>
moved to grow at 42°C for two hours (the final cell density was OD600,=0.75). The<br>
plasma membrane fraction was; prepared and western blotting, using an antibody that<br>
specifically binds to the C-teraunus of Vpu, detected a single band at approximately<br>
16KDa, indicating that Vpu was expressed and assodated wth the membranes (Fig.<br>
2A,.lane 5).<br>
Example 13. Cross-Feeding Experiments Reveal That Proline Leaks Out of Cells<br>
Expressing VPU.<br>
Uptake of proline by E. noli is well characterised and active transport of the<br>
amino acid into the cells is knovm to use the sodium gradient as the energy source<br>
(Yamato et al, 1994). To detect ivhether proline leakage occurs, the following cross-<br>
feeing assay was used: A lawn of an E. coli strain auxotrophic for proline and<br>
methionine (Met Pro), was seecsd and poured as a soft agar overlay on rmnimai<br>
drop-out media plates lacking proline but ccrafaining methionine. Sterile porous filter<br>
discs were inoculated with a Met+ Pro+ strain (XL-1 blue) containing either the<br>
pPL451 control plasmid or pPL-Vpu and placed onto the soft agar. The plates were<br>
then incubated at 37°C or 30°C fixr two days. After man time a halo growth of the<br>
Met" Pro" strain was clearly visible surrounding the disc inoculated with the cells<br>
containing pPL-Vpu incubated at 37°C (Fig. 4A). This growth can only be due to the<br>
leakage of proline from the Vpu-expressing cells on the disc. No such leakage was<br>
apparent from the control strain at 37°C nor around either strain on plates grown at<br>
30oC (Fig. 4B).<br><br>
la contrast to proline transport, the K coU methionine permease is known to<br>
belong to the ABC transports family (Rosen, 1987) and hence be energised by ATP.<br>
Identical crossfeeding experiments to those described above were set us except that<br>
the Met" Pro" strain was spreed on minimal drop-put plates lacking methionine but<br>
containing proline. No growth of this strain was evident around any of the discs (Fig.<br>
4C), indicating that methiohnie was not leaking out of the XL-1 blue cells even when<br>
Vpu was being expressed.<br>
Example 14, E.COLI Cells Expressing Vpa Require Adenine in the External<br>
Medium for Growth.<br>
It was observed that, due to an uncharacterised mutation in the adenine<br>
synthesis pathway, growth of.E coli cells of the XLI-blue strain expressing Vpu at<br>
37°C was dependant on the prtjsence of adenine in the medium. This allowed the<br>
development of an even simplisr bioassay for Vpu ion-channel activity than the<br>
proline cross-feeding assay described above: A lawn of XLI-blue cells containing the<br>
pPL-VpuplasSiid is seeded on to an agarose plate lacking adenine in the medium,<br>
small ah'quots of drugs to be tested for inhibition of the Vpu channel are spotted onto<br>
the agarose in discrete locations and the plates are incubated at 37°C for a suitable<br>
period of time (12-36 hours). Halos of growth around a particular drug application<br>
site indicate that the drug has inhibited expression of the Vpu ion channel activity that<br>
prevents growth in the absence of the drug. (Figure 5).<br>
Example 15<br>
Assay of Compounds in Planar Lipid Bilavers for Vpu Channel Blocking.<br>
Activity<br>
Comopuhds were characterized for their ability to block Vpu ion channel<br>
activity reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. Vpu N-terminal peptide (residues 1-<br>
32) dissolved in trifluoroethanol was added to the CIS chamber of the bilayer<br>
apparatus and the solutions was stirred until ion currents were observed, indicating<br>
incorporation of one or more Vpu ion channels into the bilayer. After recording the<br>
channel activity for a few minutes, drugs were added to the solutions in the CIS and<br>
TRANS chambers - with stirring - to a final concentration of 100µM. Channel<br>
activity was then recorded for at east a further three minutes and the effect of drug<br>
addition on ion current was determind by comparing the channel activity before and<br><br>
after drag addition. For each experiment drag effect was classified into four<br>
categories: "Stong block", if current wasinhibrted approximately 90-100%; "weak<br>
block", approx. 50-90% inhibition; "partial block", 
. Experiments were disregarded if currents larger than ±50pA were generated after .<br>
addition of Vpu N-peptide because in such cases it is possible that non-native peptide<br>
aggregates contribute to bilaysr breakdown. Snch aggregates, by virtue of their<br>
disorganized structure may not be specifically blocked by the drags at the<br>
concentrations tested.<br>
Table 3 summarises the results of the bilayer experiments. A novel outcome of these<br>
experiments was the strong blocking of Vpu channels observed with Phenamil.<br>
Phenamil has a phenyl group derivative at the guanidine group of amiloride.<br>
Amiloride itself is not a blocker of Vpu, whereas addition of the hexamethylene<br>
group at the 5- position of the syrazine ring created a structure (HMA) that blocks the<br>
channel at concentrations as low as 25µM; Thesenewresults with Phenamil,<br>
however, now show that a bulky hydrophobic derivative at the opposite end of the<br>
molecule can also turn amiloride into an effective Vpu channel blocker. Interestingly,<br>
benzamil, with a very similar structure was much less effective at blocking the Vpu<br>
channel.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
of BIV isolates and allowed to absorb for 2hr before complete aspiration of the<br>
medium, washing once with virus-free medium and resuspension in fresh medium.<br>
The cells were exposed to various concentration of compound either 24 hr prior to<br>
infection or after infection. Subsequent HIV replication, at various times after<br>
infection! was compared in cells exposed to drugs and in cells not exposed to drugs<br>
(controls). The progression and extent of viral replication was assayed using either an<br>
HEV DNA PCR method (Fear et al, 1998) or an ELISA method to quantitate p24 in<br>
culture supematants (Kelly et id, 1998).<br>
Table 5 provides examples of results obtained using this assay and test<br>
antiviral compounds.<br><br><br>

Peptide Synthesis<br>
A peptide corresponding to the fufl-length SARS-CoV (isolate Tor2 and<br>
Urbani) E protein (^SFVSBETGTLIVNSVIXFIAFVVFLLVTLAILTALRLCA<br>
YCasnVNVSLVEPTVYVYSRVKNLNSSEGVPDLLV) and a second peptide<br>
jomprising the first 40 amino acids of the full length E protein which correspond to<br>
the transmembrane domain (MYSFVSEKrGTLIVNSVLLFLAFWF<br>
LLVTIAJLTALRLC) were synthesized manually using FMOC chemistry and solid<br>
phase peptide synthesis The synthesis was done at the Biomolecular Resource<br>
Facility (John Curtin School of Medical Research, ANU, Australia) using a<br>
SymphonyR Peptide Synthesiser from Protein Technologies Inc. (Tucson, AZ, USA)<br>
according to the manufacturers instructions.<br>
Example 19. Peptide purification<br>
Mass spectral analysis of the synthetic peptide revealed that the preparation<br>
contained significant amounts of material with lower m/z ratio than expected, for the<br>
full-length product The majorit y of these are presumably truncated peptides<br>
generated during the peptide synthesis process. To enrich the full-length E protein,<br>
the following procedure was used, which relies on differential solubility of the<br>
smaller molecules and full-length peptide. The crude preparation was suspended at 12<br>
nag/ml in 70% CH3CN, 0.1%TFA and vortexed for 10 minutes. This suspension was<br>
centrifuged at l'0,000g for 10 mir-utes at 20aC. The supernatant was discarded and<br>
the insoluble fractions was extracted with 70% CH3CN, 0.1% TFA, as above, two .<br>
more times. The insoluble material containing the E protein was dried using<br>
Speedvac an the weight of the final product was used to calculate the yield. The<br>
purified peptide was analysed by Bruker Omaiflex MALDKTOR mass spectrometry<br>
in HABA matrix at 2.5mg/ml in rr ethanol at a 1:1 ratio and spectra were obtained in<br>
the positive linear mode. A clearpeat at m/z ratio- of 8,360.1 was seen as expected for<br>
the calculated molecular weight of full-length E protein and 4422.3 for the N-terminal<br>
E protein.<br><br>
Example 20. Planar Lipid Bilavers<br>
The SARS virus E protein was resuspended at 1mg/ml in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol The<br>
SARS virus E protein's ability to form ion channels was tested on a Warner (Warner<br>
instruments, Inc. 1125 Djxwel [ Avenue, Hamden, CT 06514) bilayer rig as follows; A<br>
lipid mix of 3:1:1, l-Palmitoyl -2-oleolyl phosphatidyl Eftaaolamnie: l-Pahmtoyl-2-<br>
oleolyl phosphatidyl Serine: l-PaInritoyl-2-oleolyi phosphatidyl choline in CHCl3<br>
was dried under N2 gas and resuspended to 50mg/ml in n-decane. Bilayers were<br>
painted across a circular hole of approximately 100µm diameter in a Delrin™ cup<br>
separating aqueous solution in he CIS and TRANS chambers. The CIS chamber<br>
contained a solution of 500mM Nad or KCL in a 5mM HEPES /buffer pH 7.2, the<br>
TRANS chamber contained a solution of 50mM NaCl or KCl, in a 5mM HEPES<br>
buffer pH 72. Silver electrodes coated in chloride with 2% agarose bridges are placed<br>
in the CIS and TRANS chamber solutions. The SARS E protein full-length or N-<br>
tenninal peptides (3-10µg) were: added to the CIS chamber, which was stirred until<br>
channel activity was detected, -The CIS chamber was earthed and the TRANS<br>
chamber was held at various holding potentials ranging between +100 to -lGOmV.<br>
Currents were recorded using a SVamer model BD-525D amplifier, filtered at 1kHz,<br>
sampling at 5 kHz and digitally recorded on the hard disk of a PC using software<br>
developed in house.<br>
Drugs to be tested for their ability to inhibit SARS E protein ion channel<br>
activity were made up at 50mM in a solution of 50% DMSO: 50% methanol For<br>
experiments testing the ability of compounds to inhibit E protein ion channel activity<br>
100 uM to 400 ixM of compound was added to the CIS chamber while stirring for 30<br>
seconds. Bilayer currents were t worded before channel activity, during channel<br>
activity and after the addition of the drag.<br>
Among the compounds tested was cinnataoylguaniditte (Bit036), a compound<br>
which was shown in earlier experiments to be antiviral and to inhibit ion channel<br>
proteins from other viruses.<br>
Example 20.1. Polyaerylamide gel electrophoresis<br>
Purified E protein was dis solved to 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml in, 6 M<br>
Urea, 10% Glycerol, 5% SDS, 503 mMDTT, 0.002% Bromophenol Blue, 62.5 mM<br>
Tris HC1 (pH 83). Peptides in solutions were heated at 100°C for 20 minutes before<br><br>
30 p,L samples were run on stacking gel 4-20% (Gradipore). SeeBlue® pre-stained<br>
standard (Eavitrogen) was used for molecular weight markers.<br>
Example 20.2 Resnlts .<br>
To test if the SARS P, protein forms ion channels the purified synthetic<br>
peptide was reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers (21). Typically, 3µg of SARS<br>
fell-length E protein was added to the CIS chamber, while stirring. This CIS chamber<br>
contained 500 mMNaCl and the TRANS chamber contained 50 mM NaCl. In 60<br>
experiments, ion currents due to SARS E protein ion.charmel activity were observed<br>
after about 5-15 minutes of s tirring. Activity was detected more rapidly and reliably<br>
with a holding potential of approximately-100mV across the bilayer. Currents<br>
recorded at-100mV, (A) and at-60mV (B) in one of these experiments are shown in<br>
Figure 6. In that experiment tine reversal potential was about +48mV and the channel<br>
conductances ware calculated to be 52pS arid 26pS, respectively. This indicates that<br>
the current-voltege,(IV) relatipnship is not linear In ten other experiments, where no<br>
protein was added to the CIS chamber, no ion channel activity was detected, even<br>
after recording for over I hour.<br>
Figure 7a shows typical current traces recorded oyer a range of potentials in NaCl<br>
solutions. In that experiment the direction of current flow reversed at +48mV (Fig<br>
7b). The IV curve shows that at the lower voltages the average current flow across the<br>
bilayer is small but at higher potentials there is an increase in average current across<br>
the bilayer, resulting in a non-linear IV relationship. In seven independent<br>
experiments, the average feversal potential was +48.3 ± 2,3 mV (mean ± 1SEM),<br>
indicating that the channels were about 37 times more permeable to Na+ ion than to<br>
CI" ions. The reversal potential is close to the Na+ equilibrium potential (+53m,V),<br>
therefore the channel is selective for Na+ ions. For these 7 experiments the channel<br>
conductance varied between 95-164 pS; the average conductance was 130 ± 13 pS.<br>
SARS E protein ion channel in sh'ghtly less selectivity for K+ ions than Na+ ions.<br>
Figure 8b shows recording of cur rents in KCl solutions at a range of potentials. In<br>
this experiment the currents reversed, at +31 mV. In seven similar experiments E<br>
protein ion channel average reversal potential was +34.5 ± 2.5 mV. Therefore the<br>
SARS E protein ion channel is about 7.2 times more permeable to K+ ions than CT<br><br>
ions. In seven experiments, the channel conductance varied ranging between 24-166<br>
pS, the average conductances was 83.4 + 26 pS.<br>
Similar results were obtaintsd with a second synthetic peptide, which corresponded to<br>
the first forty N-eiminal ammo acids of the SARS E protein "N-terminal peptide"<br>
(21). The average reversal potential in NaCl solution in four experiments was +46.3'<br>
+ 2.5 mV, indicating that the: ion channel formed by N-terminal peptide is about 25<br>
times more permeable to Na+ ion than to Cl-ions. The SARS E protein N-terminal<br>
peptide was sufficient for the formation of ion channels with properties like those of<br>
the full length SARS E protein. Therefore, the selectivity filter for the SARS E<br>
protein is most likely contained within the first forty amino acids of the N-terniinaL<br>
SARS E protein N-terminal pqptide also formed ion channels in KG solution that<br>
were similarly" selective for EH- ions compared to the full-length E protein. In five<br>
independent experiments the average channel reversal potential was +39.5 + 3.6 mV,<br>
• therefore the channel is about 11 times more permeable to K+ ions than CI" ions.<br>
- SDS-PAGE of the purified mil-length E potein peptide showed bands correspending<br>
to the full-length Eprotein (Data not shown). Larger bands of varying size up to<br>
about 20 kDa were detected, suggesting that SARS E protein may form homo-<br>
oligomers.<br>
Example 21. SARS E protein ion channel is blocked by cmnamovlguanidme and<br>
other compounds<br>
E protein ion channel activity in NaCl solutions was significantly reduced<br>
(p&gt; 0.01, n=6 experiments) by addition of 100 to 200 µM cinnamoylguahidine to the<br>
CIS chamber. The average current across the bilayer was reduced to baseline by<br>
100µM cmnarnoylguanidine. In experiments when E protein ion channels had higher<br>
conductance, 100 to 200 uM cimamoulguanidme reduced the average current across<br>
the bilayer about 4 fold;. Similarly, in four other experiments, 100 to 200 uM<br>
cinnamoylguanidine blocked channels formed by full-length E protein in KCI<br>
solutions. la two additional experiments, the SARS E protein N-terminal peptide was<br>
blocked by 100 to 200 µM cinn.unoylguani:dine, demonstrating that the<br>
cumamoylguam'drnedrug-binding site is located within the first forty amino acids of<br><br>
the E protein N-tenninal dansin. Other compounds tested in bilayers for their effect<br>
on the SAR5 B protein are shown in below in Table 6.<br><br>
Example 21.1 Results and Pisccssion.<br>
We have shwon that SARS E protine can form ion channels in lipid bilayer<br>
membranes. The ion currents reversed at positive potentials, which demonstrates that<br>
E protein ion channels are selective for monovalent cations over monovalent anions.<br>
" E protein Ion channels were about 37 times more selective for Na+ ions over Cl-ions<br>
and about 13. times more selective for K+ ions over CI- ions. In over 60 experiments<br>
theNa+ conductance of the E piotein ion channel varied from as km as 26 PS to as<br>
high as 154 pS. SBS-PAGE showed that the E protein forms homo-oligomers, and we<br>
surmised that the larger conductances were probably due to aggregation of the E<br>
protein peptide leading to larger Ion channels or the synchronous opening of many<br>
ion channels. Single channel currents were observed in several experiments and from<br>
these the channel conductance wsis calculated to be voltage dependent..<br>
The first 40 amino acids cf the N-terminal which contains the hydrophobic<br>
domain of the'SARS virus E protein is sufficient for the formation of ion channels on<br>
planar lipid bilayers. The N-termiaal E protein ion channel has the same selectivity<br>
and conductance as the full-lengrr.. E protein ion channel.<br>
The SARS virus fall length E protein ion channel activity and N-terminal<br>
domain E protein ion channel acrMty on planar lipid bilayers in NaCl and K.C1<br>
solutions was inhibited by addition of between 100µM. to 200µM<br>
cinnamoylguanidime to the CIS chamber. Inhibition or partial, inhibition of the E<br><br>
protein ion channel activity by cinnamoylguamdine has been observed in seven<br>
independent experiments in NaCl solution and four independent experiments in KCI<br>
solution.<br>
AH known coronaviruses encode an E protein with a hydrophobic N-terrm'mis<br>
transmembrane domain therefore all coronaviruses E proteins could form ion<br>
channels on planar lipid bilayers. This indicates that the E protein could be a suitable<br>
target for antiviral drags and potentially stop the spread of coronavirus from infected<br>
host cells. Drugs that block the E protein ion channel could be effective antiviral<br>
therapy for the treatment of several significant human and veterinary coronavirus<br>
diseases including SARS and the common cold.<br>

KNVYHiyQSYMHIDPFPKRVIDF; accession number NP_073554) was synthesized<br>
manually using FMOC chemistry and solid phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis<br>
was done at the Biomoleculir Resource Facility (John Curtin School of Medical<br>
Research, ANU, Australia) using a SymphonyR Peptide Synthesiser from Protein<br>
Technologies Inc..(Wobum, MS, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions to<br>
give C-terminal amides, the coupling was done with HBTU and.<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole in N-memylpyrrolidone, Each of the synthesis cycles used<br>
double coupling and a 4-fold excess of the amino acids. Temporary -N Fmoc-<br>
proteciing groups were removed using 20% piperidinc in DMF.<br>
The crude synthetic peptide was purified using the ProteoPhis™ kit (Qbiogene inc.<br>
CA), fallowing manufactures instructions. Briefly, the peptides were diluted in<br>
loading buffer (60mM Tris-Ha pH 8.3,6M urea, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.2%<br>
Bromophenol blue, ±100 mM p-mercaptoethanol) and run on 4-20% gradient<br>
polyacrylamide gels (Gradipons, NSW, Australia) in tris-glycine electrophoresis<br>
buffer (25 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS). The peptides were stained with gel<br>
code blue (Promega, NSW) auci the bands corresponding to the full-length peptide<br>
were excised out of the gel.<br>
The gel-slice was transferred to ifce ProteoPLUS™ tube and filled with tris-glycine<br>
electrophoresis buffer. The tubes: were emerged in tris-glycine electrophoresis buffer<br>
and subjected to 100 volts for ap proximately 1 hour. The polarity of the electric<br>
current was reversed for 1 minute to increase the amount of protein recovered. The<br>
peptides were harvested and cent ifuged at 13, 000 rpm for 1 minute. The purified<br>
peptides were dried in a Speedvac. and the weight of the final product was used to<br>
calculate the yield.<br><br>
Example 27.229E-E protein forms ion channels in planar lipid bflayers.<br>
Lipid bilayer studitss were performed as described elsewhere (Sunstrom, 1996/<br>
Miller, 1986). A-lipid mixture of palmitoyl-^Ieoyl-phosphatidylethanolaQiirie,<br>
palmitoyk)leoyl-phosphafodylserine and palmitoylKjleoyl-phosplratidylcholine<br>
(5:3:2) (Avaafi Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama) was used. The \ipid mixture was<br>
painted onto an aperture of 150-200 urn m the wall of a. I ml delrin cup. The aperture<br>
separates two chambers, cis and trans, both containing salt solutions at different<br>
concentrations. The cis chamber was connected to ground and the trans chamber to<br>
the input of an Axopateh 20!) amplifier. Normally the cis chamber contained either "<br>
500 mM NaCI or 500mMKCl and the trans 50 mMNaCl or 50mMKCL The bilayer<br>
formation was monitored electrically by the amplitude of the currentpulse generated<br>
by a current ramp. The potentials were measured in the trans chamber with respect to<br>
the cis. The synthetic peptide was added to the cis chamber and stirred until channel<br>
activity was seen. The currents were filtered at 1000 Hz, digitized at 5000 Hz and<br>
stored on magnetic disk.<br>
The'229E E synthetic peptide was dissolved in 2,2,2-triflnorethanol (TFE) at<br>
0.05mg/ml to 1 mg/inl. 10 µl of this was added to the cis chamber (1ml aqueous<br>
volume) of the bilayer apparatus, which was stirred via a magnetic "flea". Ionic<br>
currents, indicating channel activity in the bilayer, were typically detected within 15-<br>
30 ruin. After channels were detected the holding potential across the bilayer was<br>
varied between -100mV and+100mV to characterise the size and polarity of current<br>
flow and enable the reversal potential to be determined.<br>
In 15 experiments when the cis chamber contained 500mM NaCI solution<br>
and the trans chamber contained 50 mM NaCI solution, the average reversal potential<br>
of the channel activity was calculated to be 22 ±7 (SEM) mV. In 13 experiments<br>
where the cis chamber contained 500mM KC1 solution and the trans chamber<br>
contained 50 mM KC1 solution, the average reversal potential of the channel activity<br>
was calculated to be 38 ±4 (SEM) mV. These results indicate that the 229EB protein<br>
- forms cationselective ion charmds that are slightly more selective for K+ than for<br>
Na+ ions.<br><br>
Figure 9 shows examples of mw current data for the 229E B ion channel at various •<br>
holding potentials (cis relative to trans) in asymmetrical KC1 solutions (500/50 mM).<br>
The graph is a representative plot of average bilayer current (pA; y-axis) versus<br>

compounds were added to the aqueous solutions bathing planar lipids in which the<br>

-methanol and-2 yd of the appropriatelydttuted compound was added to the cis and/or<br>

In the example shown in Figure 10, addition of 100µm cirmamoylgaanidroe to the cis<br>
chamber greatly reduced current flow through the 229E E ion channel.<br>

Example 45 Hepatitis C Virus<br>
Ion channel activity of Hepgtffis C virus P7 Protein<br>
Testing of a Synthetic P7 Peptide for channel activity in artificial lipid bilavers<br>
A peptide mtmicMng the protein P7 encoded, by the hepatitis C virus (HCV)<br>
was synthesised having the following amino acid sequence:<br>
AIENLVILNAASLAGTHGLVSFLVFFCFAWYLKGRWVPGAVYAFGMWPLL<br>
LLLLALPQRAYA	<br>
Lipid bilayer studies were performed as described elsewhere (Miller, 1986). A<br>
lipid mixture of palmitoyl-olEoyl-phospha1idylethanolaxmine, palmitoyl-oleoyl-<br>
phosphatidylserine and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholiae (5:3:2) (Avanti Polar<br>
Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama). was used. The lipid mixture was painted onto an aperture<br>
of 150-200 um in the wall of a i ml dehin cup. The aperture separates two chambers,<br>
cis and trans, both ccmtaining stdt solutions at different concentrations. The cis<br>
chamber was connected to ground, and the trans chamber to the input of an Axopatch<br>
200 amplifier. Normally the cis chamber contained 500 mM KC1 and the trans 50<br>
mM KCl. The bilayer formation was monitored electrically by the amplitude of the<br>
current pulse generated by a cur rent ramp. The potentials were measured in the trans<br>
chamber with respect to the cis. The protein was added to the pis chamber and stirred<br>
until channel activity was seen. The currents were filtered at 1000 His,, digitized at<br>
2000 Hz and stored on magnetic disk. The .P7 peptide was dissolved in 2,2,2-<br>
Mfluorethanol (TEE) at 10mg/ml. 10 ul of this was added to the cis chamber of the<br>
bilayer which was stirred. Cham iel activity was seen within 15-20 rain.<br>
When the P7 peptide was added to the cis chamber and stirred, channel activity<br>
was recorded. The potential in the trans chamber was -80 mV and the currents are<br>
downwards. The currents reversed at +50 mV close to the potassium equihbrium<br>
potential in these solutions indica ing that the channels were cation-selective. The<br>
amplitude of the open-channel peuk is 1.7 pA corresponding to a channel<br>
conductance of about 14 pS. In most experiments, "single channels" had a much<br>
larger size, presumably because of aggregation of the P7 peptide. The currents<br>
reversed at about +40 mV in this experiment. In some experiments the solution in the<br><br>
cischamberwas 150mMKCl and 15tnMKClin the trans chamber. The P7 peptide<br>
again produced currents that reversed.<br>
Similar results were obtained when both chambers contained NaCl. Currents<br>
recorded in an experiment when the d$ chamber contained 500 mM Nad and the<br>
trans chamber 50 mMNaCL Again the currents reversed between +40 and+60 mV,<br>
close to the Na+ equilibrium potential indicating that channels were much more<br>
permeable to Na+ than to K+.<br>
The channels formed by tie P7 peptide were blocked by 5-(N,N-<br>
hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA),<br>
Addition of the P7 peptide; produced channel activity.- Addition of 2 ul of 50<br>
uM HMA to the cis chamber followed by stirring resulted in disappearance of the<br>
chanel activity. Block of channel activity produced by the P7 peptide with 100 µM<br>
HMA was recorded in 4 experiments. In 2 experiments, sodium channels (500/50)<br>
were blocked by 500 µM HMA<br>
When 10 mM CaCl2 was added to the cis chamber (K solutions) the reversal<br>
potential of the currents produced by P7 peptide shifted to more negative potentials<br>
indicating a decrease in the PK/PCI ratio.<br>
When the cis chamber contiined 500 mM CaCl2 and the trans chamber 50 mM<br>
CaCfe, both positive and negative currents were seen at potentials around +20 mV and<br>
it was not possible to determine a reversal potential.<br>
Example 46. Recombinant Expression of HCV p7 protein.<br>
Two cDNA fragments, eath encoding the same polypeptide corresponding to<br>
the amino acid sequence of the HCV-1 ap7 protein, were "synthesised commercially<br>
by GeneScript. The two cDNAs differed in nucleotide sequence such that in one<br>
cDNA ("cDp7.coli") the codons were optimised for expression of the p7 protein in.<br>
E.coli while in the other cDNA ("Dp7.ttiatn)" codons were biased for expression in<br><br>
mammalian cell lines. cDp7 coli was cloned into the plasmid pPL451 as a<br>
BamHl/EcoRI fragment for expression in E.coli. cDp7.mam was cloned into vectors<br>
(for example, pcDNA3.1 vaccinia virus, pfastBac-1) for expression of p7 in<br>
mammalian cell lines.<br>
Example 47. Role of p7 in enhancement of Gag VLP Budding.<br>
The budding of virus-like particles (VLP) from cultured HeLa cells results<br>
from the expression of retroviial Gag proteins in the cells and co-expression of small<br>
viralion. channels, such as M2, Vpu and 6K, with the Gag protein enhances budding.<br>
Ihteresttrigly, the viral ion channels can enhance budding of heterologous virus<br>
particles. Therefore, to assess budding enhancement by p7 it wag co-expressed with<br>
the HEV-1 Gag protein in HeLg, cells, and VLP release into the culture medium was<br>
measured by Gag ELISA. To achieve mis, the plasmids pcDNAp7 (pc DNA3.1 =<br>
pcDp7.mam as described in Example 20, p7 expressed under control of the T7~ - -<br>
promoter) andpcDNAGag (HIV-1 Gag protein expressed under control of the T7<br>
promoter) were cotransfected into HeLa cells infected with the vaccinia virus strain<br>
vTF7.3 (expresses T7 SNA polymerase) and culture supernatants were collected for<br>
ELISA assay alter 16 hours inctbation.<br>
Example 48, Assay of the ability of compounds to inhibit p7 ion channel<br>
functional activity.<br>
The two methods of detecting p7 ion channel functional activity, described in<br>
Examples 33-35, were employed to assay the ability of compounds to inhibit the p7<br>
channel. In the case of Example 33, compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit<br>
p7 channel activity in planar lipid bilayers. In the case of Example 35 compounds<br>
were tested for their ability to reduce the number of VLPs released from cells<br>
expressing both p7 and HIV-1 Gsg. -<br><br>

To determine the antiviral activity of compounds against EAV replication<br>
(strain Bueyrus; ATCC VR-796), an assay measuring reduction in the number of<br>
plaques formed in monolayers oi'EAV infected BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) was<br>
developed: A virus stock was amplified in RK-13 cells (ATCC CCL-37) and this was<br>
then used to infect confluent monolayers of BHK-21 cells grown in 6-well tissue .<br>
culture plates by exposure to the virus at an MOI of 5X10-3 pfu/cell for 1 hour at<br>
37°,C 5% CO2. The infective inoculum was removed and nd the cells were overlayed<br>
with a 1% sea plaque overlay (Cambrex Bio Science) .in MEM containing 10% FCS<br>
containing and 10,5 or 1 pM of compounds to be tested or the appropriate level of<br>
solvent used for the compounds (uontrol). Plates were subsequently incubated at<br>
37oC (in 5% CO2) for 3 days post infection, after which time culture supernatant was .<br>
removed and the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution in 20% ethanol<br><br>
for 10 minutes. Plaques were counted in all wells and the percentage reduction in<br>
plaque number compared to solvent control was calculated. Measurements were<br>
performed in duplicate to quadruplicate wells.<br>

painted onto an aperture of 150-200 µm in the wall of a 1 ml delrin cup. The aperture<br>
separates two chambers, cis and trans, both containing salt solutions at different<br>
concentrations. The cis chamber was connected to ground and the trans chamber to<br>
the input of an Axopatch 200 amplifier. Normally the cis chamber contained S00 mM<br>
KCl and the trans 50 mM KCl. The bilayer formation was monitored electrically by<br>
the amplitude of the current pulse generated by a current ramp. The potentials were<br>
measured in the trans chamber with respect to the cis. The protein was added to the<br>
cis chamber and stirred until channel activity was seen. The currents were filtered at<br>
1000 Hz, digitized at 5000 Hz and stored on magnetic disk..<br>
The dengue virus M protein C- teaminal peptide (DMVC) was dissolved in 2,2,2-<br>

Compounds were tested at 10,5, 2.5, L25 and 0.625 uM for activity against<br>
Dengue 1 strain Hawaii using a cyloproliferation assay which measures the effect of<br>
dengue virus infection on proliferation of LLC-MK2, rhesus macaque monkey kidney<br>
ceils. The LLC-MK2 cells were infected with a predetermined amount of virus,<br>
titrated such that cell proliferation ii infected cultures would be significantly reduced<br><br>
compared to uninfected controls. The infected cells were then plated at 1.5x103 cells<br>
per well in a 96 well plate. Negative controls (no vims, no experimental compound).<br>
positive controls (virus, no experimental compound), and cytotoxicity controls<br>
(experimental compound, nc virus) were run with each drug assay. The cultures wei<br>
allowed to grow for 7 days and then Alamar Blue, a fluorescent dye that measures th<br>
metabolism of the cultures (red/ox), was added to each culture and the fluorescence<br>
value for each culture was raesasured. The negative control without experimental<br>
compound or virus was fixed at 100%. The positive controls and the cultures with<br>
compound were scored by calculating their average fluorescence as a percentage of<br>
the negative control. At least six replicate wells were measured for each experiments<br>
condition.<br>
Example 57 Effect of compounds in Dengue antiviral assay:<br><br><br><br>
A correlative study was performed to measure correlation between the activity<br>
scores assigned to compounds tessted m the Vpu bacterial assay and the ability of<br>
these compounds to inhibit HIV -1 in the anti-viral assay.<br>
Example 58.2. Methodology<br>
„.„,The p24-antigen, data for.twelve compounds.representing.various substituted.acyl<br>
guanidinss was compared with the activity scores obtained for those compounds in<br>
the Vpu bacterial assay. The data from each assay was initially rank ordered for<br>
effectiveness. The rank order for the Vpu bacterial assay was determined from all<br>
activity scores, the highest score indicating the greatest effectiveness. The rank order<br>
for the anti-HIV-1 assay was dettsrmined based on the overall average value of p24<br>
antigen measured in culture supenatants at all of the drug concentrations tested, with<br>
the lowest score indicating the grsatest effectiveness. The two rank orders generated<br>
were then compared statistically by generating the Spearman's Rank correlation<br>
coefficient.<br>
Example 58.3. Resnlts and Conclusion<br>
The Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.785 which, by comparison with<br>
a statistical table of critical values (for n=12), indicates that the two rank orders are<br>
significantly positively correlated (P
In addition, a different con rparison of the Vpu Bacterial assay rank order with<br>
a yes/no score for whether the anti -viral data indicated a p24 reduction of at least one<br>
order of magnitude, aligned the 'y JS' group of compounds with the top 6 compounds<br>
by the bacterial assay (Table 19b)..<br><br>
These results are indicative that a positive correlation easts between bacterial<br>
assays and the antiviral assajs as peiformed-according to the present invention. The<br>
bacterial assay may therefore be a useful tool in screening for compounds that exhibit<br>
anti-viral activity.<br>

Example 58.5. Method;<br>
MHV plaque reduction activity data for 96 compounds screened were sorted from<br>
greatest to least percent plaque reduction and rank orders, were, assigned to the list of<br>
compounds, This was performed for the data generated by exposure to both lO^M and<br>
1µM concentrations of the compounds, giving rise to two rank order lists.<br>
Similarly, a rank order list was generated for the MHVE bacterial bioassay scores for the<br>
same 96 compounds. Where or e or more compounds had the same score, the rank values<br>
for that group were averaged.<br>
Spearman's statistical test for [as described in "Mathematical Statistics with<br>
Applications" (2nd edn): Mendenhall W., Scheaffer, RL..&amp; Wackerly, DD. Duxbury<br>
Press, Boston Massachusatts - 3981] was used to compare rank orders. Briefly, this<br>
involved calculating the Sum of squares (SS) of the differences between rank values for .<br>
each compound, and then generating the Spearman's Rank Correlation coefficient (Rs)<br>
according to the formula: Rs =] -(6.SS/n(nZTl)), where n is the number of compounds<br>
ranked (96 in this case). Rs is then compared to a Table of critical values to determine<br>
statistical significance (P values)<br>
Example 58.6. Summary of Results:<br>
This table summarises the Rs and P values generated as a result of the indicated<br>
pairwise comparisons between mnk orders.<br><br><br>
Example 58.7. Conclusions:<br>
The rank order comparison of 96 compounds assayed in the bacterial bio-<br>
assay and the antiviral assay show that MHVE bacterial assay rank order for the<br>
compounds tested is significantly positively correlated with, the rank orders generated<br>
by the MHV plaque redaction assay. The significant correlation between trie assays<br>
is highly indicative that either assay may be utilised to identify compounds that may<br>
be useful. The bacterial assay nay thereby be ai useful tool in screening for<br>
compounds that exhibitanti-vhal-activityr<br>
Example 58.8. Correlation Between Percent inhibition of 229E plaque formation<br>
and 229E-E bacterial bio-assay score.<br>
A positive correlation was seen between the activity scores assigned to<br>
compounds when tested in the Eirraan Coronavirus 229E E-protein bacterial bio-<br>
assay and the percent inhibition exbibited by these compounds in the Human<br>
Coronavirus 229B plaque assay.<br>
Example 58.9. Method:<br>
229E plaque reduction activity data for 97 compounds screened against 2.5 µM<br>
compound concentration were sorted from greatest to least percent plaque reduction and<br>
rank orders were assigned to the list of compounds. Similarly, a rank order list was<br>
generated for the 229E E bacterial bioassay scores for the same 97 compounds. Where one<br>
or more compounds had the same score, therank values for that group were averaged.<br>
Spearman's statistical test for [as cescribed in. 'Mathematical Statistics with Applications"<br>
(2ni edn): Mendenhall, W., Scheaifer, RL.,&amp; Wackerly, Dp. Duxbury Press, Boston<br><br>
Massachusetts -1981] was used to compare rank orders. Briefly, this involves calculating<br>
the Sum of squares (SS) of file differences between rank values for each compound, and<br>
then generating the Spearman's Rank Correlation coefficient (Rs) according to the<br>
formula: Rs = 1-(6.SS/u(n2-).)), where n is the number of compounds ranked (97 in this<br>
case). Rs is then compared to a Table of critical values to determine statistical significance<br>
(P values).<br>
Example 58.9.1. Summary of Results and Conclusions<br>
This table summarises the Rs and P values generated as a result of the indicated pairwise<br>
comparisons between rank orders.<br><br>
The results above indicate that the 229E bacterial assay rank order for the<br>
compounds tested is significan fly positively correlated with the rank orders generated<br>
by the 229B plaque reduction assay. This result combined with that shown in<br>
Examples 49.1 and 49.4, provides strong evidence that either assay may be utilised to<br>
identify compounds that may be useful. The bacterial assay may thereby be a useful<br>
tool in screening for compounds that exhibit anti-viral activity.<br>
