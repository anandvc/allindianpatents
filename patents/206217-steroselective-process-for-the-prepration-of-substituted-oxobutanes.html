BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of Lawrenceville-Princeton Rd., P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
ORGL<br>
93/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
The present invention relates to a     stereoselective process for preparation of substituted oxobutanes.<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial Numbers 60/277,531 filed March 21,2001 and 60/225,695 filed August 16, 2000.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of (3S,28)-l-halo-2-hydroxy-3-(protected)amino-4-substituted butanes by stereoselective reduction of the corresponding oxo compounds. The substituted butanes produced in accordance with the process of the inventions are precursors of hydroxyethylamine isostere sub-units present in many molecules therapeutically useful as inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, renin and HIV-protease.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Bing-nan Zhou etal. J. Am Chem. Soc, 105, pages 5926-5928, 1983 describe the chemomicrobiological synthesis of L-carnitine, which plays an important role in the human metabolism and transport of long-chain fatty acids. Particularly, this paper teaches the reduction by baker's yeast, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, of ethyl K-chloroacetoacetate to ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate.<br>
Kazutoshi Ushio et al Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 27, No. 23, pages 2657-2660,1986, disclose the reduction of beta-keto esters by methanol grown yeast. This paper teaches that the subject reaction causes dramatic shifts of the enantiomer excess of the resultant product in the direction of the D-isomer. This phenomena was produced when the reaction was carried out utilizing yeast grown in methanol due to enzymes characteristic of yeast grown in such media.<br>

Markus Christen et al. J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Cotnmun. pages 264-266, 1988, discloses the synthesis of four stereoisomers of methyl-6-(p-chlorophenylthio)-3,4-dihydrohexanoate in which the key introduction of chirality was effected by an appropriate yeast reduction. It is stated therein that, although the reduction of beta-keto esters with yeast has been studied extensively, it remains difficult to predict either the absolute configuration of the product(s) or, in particular, the enantiomeric excess likely to be achieved.<br>
Antonio Trincone et al, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. 35, pages 559-564,1990 describe asymmetric reduction of ketones with resting cells of Sulfolobus solfataricus. It is stated that the reductive ability of the resting cells of this organism strongly depends on the phase of cell growth.<br>
Ramesh Patel et al, Enzyme Microb. Technol., Vol. 13, pages 906-912,1991 describe the stereospecific microbial reduction of 4,5-dihydro-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl-lH-l)-benzazepin-2-one. In particular, it is disclosed that a key intermediate (3R-cis)-I,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-hydroxy-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-l -benzazepine-2-one was made by the stereoselective microbial reduction of the parent ketone. It is stated that it was possible by the selection of specific conditions to obtain a single isomer from among four known possibilities.<br>

A particularly important AIDS compound disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,849,911 is [3S-(3R*,8R*,9R*,12R*)]-3,12-Bis(l,l-dimethylethyl)-8-hydroxy-4,11 -dioxo-9-(phenylmethyl)-6{ [4-(2-pyridinyl)phenyl]methyl}-2,3,6,10,13-pentaazaretetradecanedioic acid dimethyl ester. This compound may be directly synthesized from the (lS,2S)-l-halo-2-hydroxy-3-(protected)amino-4-substituted butanes represented by formula I. The fact that the process of the present invention produces a very high yield of the trans (1S,2S) enantiomer of the substituted butanes represented by formula I makes it very important to the ultimate efficiency of the synthesis of the therapeutic compound described above.<br>

The pH given above for the media is post-sterilization. Before sterilization, the pH is preferably adjusted to from about 6 to 8, most preferably about pH 6.5. The media are then sterilized, for example, by heating at a temperature of about 121°C for 30 minutes. Following sterilization, the media are adjusted to pH 6.5 to 7.5, most preferably about pH 7.0. During microbial growth and the reduction process, the pH is maintained at between about 4.0 and 9.0, preferably between about pH 6.0 and 8.0. An appropriate base or acidic salt from among the constituents named above can conveniently be utilized for adjustment of the pH.<br>
The temperature of the reaction mixture is a measure of the heat energy available for the reduction process, and for this reason, a suitable temperature should be maintained to ensure that there is sufficient energy available for the process to go to completion. A suitable temperature range for the process of the invention is in the range of from about 15°C to about 60°C, preferably from about 25°C to about 40°C. Pressure is not known to be critical for the practice of the process of the invention and for convenience about atmospheric pressure is typically maintained.<br>
The process of the present invention is preferably carried out under aerobic conditions. Agitation and aeration of the reaction mixture is also beneficial to the subject process in that is affects the amount of oxygen available for the biotransformation. The process is advantageously carried out, for example, in shake-flask cultures or fermentor tanks during the growth of the microorganisms in a single-stage or two-stage process as described above. Agitation in the range of from<br>
12<br><br>
GY56<br>
about 50 to 1000 RPM is preferred, with from about 50 to 500 RPM being most preferred. Aeration of from about 0.1 to 10 volumes of air per volume of media per minute (v/Vt.) is preferred, with aeration of about 5 volumes per volume of media per minute being particularly preferred.<br>
Complete conversion of the compound represented by formula II may require, for example, from about 4 to 48 hours, typically from about 4 to 24 hours, measured from the time of addition of the compound represented by formula II to the media. It is preferred that the media be aqueous based, although an organic liquid or a miscible or immiscible, i.e. biphasic, organic/aqueous liquid mixture may be utilized as well.<br>
The stereoselective enzymatic reduction process of the present invention may be carried out using a co-factor such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), especially when an isolated enzyme would be utilized. NADH, for example, may thereafter be regenerated and reused. A further enzyme that regenerates the NADH in situ may be employed such as formate dehydrogenase or glucose dehydrogenase. Suitable hydrogen donors include molecular hydrogen, a formate (e.g. an alkali metal or ammonium formate), glucose, a hypophosphite or an electrochemical reduction in the presence of a viologen, for example methyl viologen. It is also possible to regenerate NADH without further enzymes using, for example, ethanol or formate.<br>
It is further preferred to add the compound of formula II to the reaction media so that it is from about 0.2% to about 5 % by weight, based on the combined weight of starting compound and media. The inoculum of microorganism relative to the amount of starting material is sufficient to provide for the enzymatic reduction of the compound represented by formula II with the times described above, generally from about 5 wt.% to about 30 wt.% cells concentration. Utilizing the preferred reaction parameters described above with the microorganisms given will provide a reaction yield of greater than 70%, optimally in excess of 99% and, unexpectedly, an diastereomeric purity greater than 93%, optimally in excess of 99% of the desired enantiomer of the compound represented by formula I. The product of the reduction process of the present invention, i.e. the compounds represented by formula I may be recovered by any suitable methods for isolation and/ or purification, e.g.<br>

Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 cells (1 mL) was inoculated into 100 mL of Medium 1 as noted above in a 500 mL flask and incubated at 28°C and 200 RPM on a shaker for 22 hours. The pH of 50 cells broth was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 M potassium phosphate buffer. Glucose was added to the cell broth at 25 mg/mL and 50 mg. of (lS)-[N-(l-benzyl-2-oxo-3-chloro)propyl]carbamic acid t-butyl ester (the substrate) was added thereto. The biotransformations (reductions) were carried out at 28°C and 200 RPM on a shaker. At predetermined times the reaction mixtures were quenched with two volumes of a 60:40 mixture of t-butyl methyl ether and toluene, and the separated organic phase was filtered through a 0.2 micron filter and collected. Two mL of the organic phase was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and the residue taken up with 1 mL of acetonitrile, filtered and analyzed by HPLC for (lS,2S)-[N-(l-benzyl-2-hydroxy-3-chloro)propyl]carbamic acid t-butyl ester (the product). The results are summarized in Table 1 below.<br><br>

Example 2<br>
Use of Whole Cells: Two Stage Process<br>
The substrate and the product for this Example were as described in Example 1. Cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 and Rhodococcus erythropolis DSM 6971 (1 mL) were individually inoculated into 100 mL portions of Medium 1 as noted above in a 500 mL flask and incubated at 25°C and 280 RPM on a shaker for 48 hours. One hundred mL of each culture was innoculated into 15mL of Medium 1 combined in a fermentor. Growth in the fermentor was carried out at 25°C, 15 LPM (liters per minute) aeration and 500 RPM agitation for 36 hours. Cells were harvested from the fermentor and used for the enzymatic conversion (biotransformation) of (IS)- [N-(l-benzyl-2-oxo-3-chloro)propyl]carbamic acidt-butyl ester (the substrate) to (lS,2S)-[N-(l-benzyl-2-hydroxy-3-chloro)propyl]carbamic acid t-butyl ester (the product). Cell suspensions were prepared by suspending the cells, 20 grams in 100 mL of 64 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. To each suspension was added 25 mg/mL of glucose and a predetermined concentration of substrate. The biotransformation of the substrate to the product was carried out at 28°C and 160 RPM on a shaker. At predetermined times the reaction mixtures were quenched and the product obtained and analyzed as described in Example 1. The results are summarized in Table 2 below.<br>
