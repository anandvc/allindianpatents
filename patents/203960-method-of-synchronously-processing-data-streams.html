THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
Â»<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
30-10-2006<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the low memory and low processing power synchronization method for different media types in a single task.<br>
This invention relates to a method of synchronously processing data streams.<br>
In particular this invention relates to a method of synchronously processing data streams, for synchronously processing and rendering digitized media data streams where each data stream is made up of a sequence of samples.<br>
Still particularly, the method includes processing each data stream in a single task.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A multimedia framework is a system in which, a media streams originated from source components such as a storage system or the devices such as camera and microphone, are passed through compression or decompression components, and are sent to the sink components such as a storage system or devices such as speaker and/or display device in real-time. The multimedia framework also presents media streams together in a synchronized way, for example audio and video media are to be rendered together in a synchronized way.<br>
In this invention the method to process the media streams in a synchronous manner is described. The general ways to achieve this synchronization are providing hardware timers for each source and sink components and assigning the media timestamps to each media samples or to have a hardware times associated with every component which are synchronized with each other so that they produce or render media samples in a synchronized way. Also the each media type is processed in an independent task. Some of the prior arts in this field are given below.<br>
2<br><br><br>
A multi media framework system such as in Fig I of the accompanying drawings , describes a prior art method where data processing rate of only one upstream component [component 1] from a media source possibly from a storage device to a media sink component, such as an LCD or a file system is controlled by a clock source [the timing module] . The [component 2] depends upon the timing information received in the data stream from component 1. The disadvantage of this method is that there is no feedback from the final element/device i.e. the [media sink component] , which actually outputs data. Also there can be an overall drift in processing times in this kind of system.<br>
An alternative framework system is described in Fig 2 of the accompanying drawings . In the block diagram of this figure, data streams are obtained from media sources such as the audio and video source shown in the figure. Audio and video data is processed in the audio and video processing components respectively to render in media sinks such as the video display and the speaker. A single clock [reference clock] source is used to control different modules in the system such as the audio source, the video source the speaker and the video display. These blocks query the central reference clock source for the current system time and take decisions periodically. This leads to excessive overheads in the system.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6049769 discloses a system useful in video editing for synchronizing digital audio to digital video. This method employs a hardware setup for acquiring audio-video data from multiple channels and synchronizing it while editing process. The system employs multiple clocks derived from a common hardware clock<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6697930 discloses a multi-standard video decoder and decompression method wherein hardware clocks are used for synchronization, each codec has a clock, which is synchronized, with the master clock on a complete hardware system.<br>
Both the above stated systems are implemented in hardware, so in spite of having higher accuracy, these methods lack flexibility and are complex in nature.<br>
3<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6546190 discloses a synchronization algorithm of multiple media streams, wherein the time codes are recorded periodically on the medium and a relationship is established between each element of the medium and absolute reference time exists. Here recorded time codes represent the absolute time and sent with the media samples.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6320882 discloses a method for handling multiple real-time service events, wherein a periodic timer tick used to process the real time events. The events are generated by adding the global timer value to the queue time period and stored on the respective queue in sorted order. The events are queued and processed till the global timer value is less than the event in the queue.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5553222, 5596696 disclose a multimedia synchronization system where, synchronization in different multimedia objects is provided using clock objects associated with each of the multimedia object. Clock objects are software timers that can support delay by blocking a thread for some time, set and get time, wakeups using inter process communication methods. Synchronization between two clocks is provided by determining the offset between the two clocks and by comparing the rate of the two clocks.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5661665 discloses a multi-media synchronization method, which calculates a media presentation time using a common clock reference. This presentation time is attached to every media sample. All the processing objects including the sink component uses the clock to render data synchronously.<br>
The aforesaid patents associate a clock with each processing module as well as the device, the synchronization procedures are complex in nature, use more OS resources including more memory.<br>
US Patent No. 6564382 describes a method which plays a set of multimedia tasks by registering the tasks with a common scheduler, and the scheduler is adapted to control the execution of the tasks. However this method implements audio decoding, video decoding<br>
4<br><br>
and rendering in separate tasks, which increases the OS kernel objects and task switching between these tasks.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a framework system, which supports multiple sessions with different timing requirement and processing the data stream in a single task.<br>
Accordingly, those concerned with the design, development and use of audio-video synchronization in mobile environments have long recognized a need for improved methods providing enhanced flexibility, performance and low OS and system requirements. The present invention clearly fulfills all these needs.<br>

The framework described in this invention comprises the following modules:<br>

â¢	Session manager<br>
â¢	Session<br>
â¢	Media parsers<br>
9<br><br>
System timing module has the capability of generating configured timing signals by using the constant rate timing signals from operating system.<br>
Session manager received the data stream and creates the task and a session within the task if the resources are available.<br>
Session can parse the media streams to get the media types. Session also invokes the media data parsers to parse the individual media types to get the frame rates. Session has the computing means to convert the frame rates into time slots and to determine the largest time slot. Session registers this time slot with the system-timing module and requests for the timing signals at the periodic interval of the registered time slot. Session also has a counter creator means by which it can create the media counter for each of the media type and session counter.<br>
On receiving the timing signal, session increments the session counter by the registered time slot period and sends an acknowledgement to the system-timing module. Session then processes each media sequentially. The samples of each media are processed sequentially and the media counter is incremented by the corresponding media time slot after each sample is processed. When the media counter exceeds the session counter, the stream switcher switches to next media type. This process is carried out for all the media types in the data stream. The processed samples are immediately rendered. The above process is carried out until the data stream is over or the process is stopped by external means. When on of this condition occurs the session manager closes the session and the task.<br>
On processor overload condition, the acknowledgement from the session to system timing module gets delayed. In this case the system timing modules accelerates the generation of timing signals to compensate the lag. If the acknowledgement does not arrive in a predetermined period then the system-timing module informs the session manager and the session manager kills the session and the task.<br>
The rate of processing the samples is control by the above algorithm hence in the devices input rate is equal to the output rate that reduces the buffer requirement.<br>
10<br><br>
Also all the media types are processed in a single task hence the task switching overheads are minimized in this method.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides methods and apparatus for solving the problems associated with the prior art by providing a unique means for synchronously processing media data streams consisting of at least one media type.<br>
The invention is suitable for processing of multimedia data streams, which requires synchronization between multiple streams or processing of any individual stream at a precise rate.<br>
Figure 3 shows a media framework system [FW] in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The media framework takes data streams I/p... 1 to l/p...n data stream] as an input from media sources such as the storage system or devices like a camera and microphone. The media framework FW performs decompression or compression of the data streams and sends outputs to a storage device or devices like LCD and speaker. Media framework [FW} can reside on computer system or PDAs or mobile devices. The media framework has to process the data stream in a synchronized manner.<br>
12<br><br>
In figure 3 the modules of the media framework are shown. Block [201] is the operating system timer block,  [202] system timing module, block [203] the session manager and<br>
blocks [204... 1 ] to [204...n]  are the sessions for each data stream I/p...l to I/p	n,<br>
received by the framework FW. The session manager [203] receives application commands [AC] and input data stream segments . The session manager [203] creates a plurality of sessions [204... 1 to 204...n] as per application commands. Each session takes timing information form the sytem timing module [202] and processes the input data stream. The session sends the processed data streams to the sink components such as the LCD or speaker. The system timing module [202] generates the timing information requested by each session using the operating system timer [201].<br>
Figure 4 shows the functionality of block [202], system-timing module in detail. The system timing module has a registering means block [202.3] and deregistering means block [202.6] which a session uses to register and deregister its session timing signal rate requirement. The system timing module consists of the first receiver means [202.1] that receives the constant rate operating system timing signals from block [201], the operating system timer at a regular time interval of "n" and the generator module [202.2] that generates the configured rate session timing signals for a session at a regular time interval of "m". Unlike the cited inventions current method provides session timing signals to all the sessions using only one operating system timer and thus current invention reduces the OS overheads. The system timing module also consists of a disabling means [202.7] which will disable its ability to receive operating system timing signals in the event of an absence of a session within the framework [FW]<br>
Figure 5 shows the functionality of block [203], the session manager. Session manager has blocks to create a Session [203.1] and a block to close a session [203.2] and a block to terminate a session [ 203.3]. Each session is associated with a task.. Session manager also maintains the resource database. This resource database contains information such as on the availability of a device or a codec so as to evaluate whether a session can be created or not. A session is only created if the resource database indicated the availability of a device and codec required.<br>
13<br><br>
Figure 6 to figure 8 show the modules of block [204], session in detail.<br>
Figure 6 shows the data stream segment being given to the media parser, block [205], which identifies the media types media type 1 to media type n present in the data stream segment..<br>
In Figure 7 it is shown that the data stream segments associated with the identified media types are parsed by the second parser, the media data parser, block [206]. The media data parser takes data stream segment associated with each media type as input and parses these to obtain the frame rates corresponding to the data stream segment associated with each media type. Each frame rate is given as an input to the converter, block [207], which converts the frame rate into a time slot corresponding to the time required to process a frame in the data stream segment.. The converted time slots are given to the selector, block [208], which selects the largest time slot from all the time slots.<br>
The session [204] now registers a request for session timing signals corresponding to the selected largest time slot with the system timing module [202].<br>
Figure 8 shows the basic activity performed in the session [204] after having registered its request with the system timing module. The session uses the counter creator [204.1] to create session [204.4] and media time counters [204.7]. The counter initializer [204.2] then initializes these time counters to zero. A sequence of samples in the data stream segment associated with a media type are processed in the media processor [204.10]. The media processor receives as input the unprocessed samples from input data receiver [204.3]. After processing the sequence of samples the media counter corresponding to the media type whose samples have been processed is incremented by the corresponding media time slot in incremented block [204.6] . The comparator shown in block [204.8] compares the media time counter [204.7] with the session time counter [204.4]. If the media time counter has not exceeded the session time counter then the next sample in the sequence will be processed. If the media time counter exceeds the session time counter<br>
14<br><br>
then the switcher shown in block [204.9] selects the next data stream segment corresponding to the next media type to be processed. The process is repeated till all the media types are processed . The session timing signal receiver [204.11] receives the next session timing signal from the system timer module [202]. The session time counter [204.4] is incremented in block [204.12]. Now the process is repeated till the input data stream is over or if stopped by an external means. The advantage of such a procedure is that all the media types are processed in a single task so that context switching overheads are reduced.<br>
Figure 9 shows sessions [204] that interact with the system-timing module [202] and the interaction between the module [202] with the session manager [203].. Session [204] sends a request to the system-timing module [202] for registering the largest time slot and waits for the session timing signals from the system-timing module. System timing module has a register, block [202.3] that registers the request. The system timing module [202] generates the session timing signals at a configured rate by means of the generator shown in block [202.2] and sends them to the session. On receiving the session timing signal, the session sends an acknowledgement of the receipt of the session timing signal to the session manager [202.5] and processes the input data stream . The interval between the acknowledgements sent by the session on receiving the session timing signals is monitored by a monitor in system timing module show in block [202.5]. Such a monitoring helps in detecting a lag caused by processor overload as described later. The session timing signals are received and processed periodically until the data stream is over or the process is stopped by an external means. When the stream is over or it is stopped by external means then the session send a deregister request to the system timing module. The deregister means shown in block [202.6] in system timing module accepts the request and stops the session timing signal generation process.<br>
In case of a processor overload, the acknowledgements that are sent to the system-timing module on receiving the session timing signals get delayed. The monitor, block [202.5], compares the period between two acknowledgements with a predetermined warning and error periods. If the acknowledgement period exceeds the warning period then with the<br>
15<br><br>
accelerator means shown in block [202.4] system timing module accelerates the rate of generation of configured session timing signals. Thus it compensates the previous lag caused by processor overload. When the acknowledgement period exceeds the error period then session manager, shown in block [203] in figure 5, is given a message to close the session. Thus if a task is overloading the processor then the task can be terminated and the resources used by the task are recovered.<br>
As shown in figure 3, when a session [204... 1] is processing a data stream , the framework can receive other data streams [204...n] concurrently or disconcurrently and can create a new session in a new task for the received data stream. The new data stream can be processed concurrently or disconcurrently in the new task. All the sessions in the framework will use services of same session manager [203] and system manger [202]. Such simultaneous processing of multiple data streams within the same framework was not envisaged by previous cited inventions.<br>
The flow diagram in Figure 10 begins with receiving the application command data stream segment in block [1001]. On receiving a command to create a session required for a data stream segment the session manager creates the task in block [1002] and also creates the session within the task in block [1003].<br>
The session obtains individual media types from the data stream in block [1004], creates media and session time counters in block [1005], initializes the time counters to zero in block [1006]. The frame rate for each media type is obtained by parsing the data stream segment in block [1007], the frame rates are converted to the time slots in block [1008] and the largest time slot is selected in block [1009]. This largest time slot is registered with the system-timing module in block [1010].<br>
The flow diagram in Figure 11 gives the functionality of the session on receiving the session timing signal from the system-timing module i.e. the connector "A" in figures 10 and 11.   Block [1101] receives the session timing signal and block [1102] acknowledges<br>
16<br><br>
the session timing signal. Block [1103] represents the activity of incrementing the session counter by the registered time slot.<br>
Block [1104] shows the second receiver means that receives the next unprocessed sample of a media type and [1105] processes the sample. Block [1106] increments the media counter by the corresponding media time slot.<br>
The decision mechanism for iterating the process from block [1104] to block [1106] for different media types and to check the termination condition is shown in Figure 12.<br>
The session counter is compared with the media time counter in block [1201] and if the condition is false the flow resumes to block [1104] [connector "C in figures 12 and 13]. If the condition is true then it is checked if all the media types in the data stream are processed, in block [1202], if not then the process from block [1104] to block [1106] is iterated for the next media type [connector "C in figures 11 and 12] . If all the media types are processed then in block [1203] the termination condition is checked. If the data stream is over or the processing is stopped then the flow goes to block [1204] in which session send a request for deregistration to the system-timing module else the flow is resumed to the block [1101] [connector "A" in figures 11 and 12] . Block [1205] and [1206] show closing of the session and the task respectively.<br>
Flow diagram in figure 13 shows the flow of the system-timing module in detail. Block [1301] receives the registration request from the session. Block [1302] receives the constant rate operating system timing signals, which are used by Block [1303] to generate the configured rate signals. Block [1304] waits for a receipt of session timing signal from the session and receives it. Block [1305] checks if the receipt of the session timing signal is arrived from the session at expected time. If the receipt is received in time then the process from block [1302] to block [1304] is iterated until the condition in block [1310], becomes false. Block [1310] checks if the deregister request is received by the system-timing module from session. If the deregister signal is received then the process of the session timing signal generation is stopped in block [1311]. If the receipt is not received<br>
17<br><br>
in time then the session timing signal generation rate is accelerated in block [1306]. The condition whether the receipt is not received in predetermined error period is checked in block [1307]. If the condition is true then an error message is posted to session manager in block [1308] and the session is closed in block [1309] else the flow is redirected to the block [1310]. <br>
