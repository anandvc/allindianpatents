				<td>Aluminium Strip for Lithographic Printing Plate Supports<br>
The invention relates to an aluminium strip for<br>
lithographic printing plate supports, consisting of an<br>
aluminium alloy, to a method for producing an aluminium<br>
strip for lithographic printing plate supports and to a<br>
printing plate support.<br>
Printing plate supports for lithographic printing, made of<br>
an aluminium alloy, must satisfy very stringent requirements in order to be suitable for modern printing<br>
technology. On the one hand, it must be possible to<br>
homogeneously roughen the printing plate support produced<br>
from an aluminium strip, using mechanical, chemical and<br>
electrochemical roughening methods and combinations of the<br>
described roughening methods. On the other hand, the<br>
printing plates are often subjected to a burn-in process at<br>
between 220 and 300°C with a heating time of from 3 to 10<br>
min after the exposure and development, in order to cure<br>
the applied photo layer. The printing plate support should<br>
lose as little strength as possible during this burn-in<br>
process, so that the printing plate supports continue to be<br>
readily handleable. The fatigue or bending cycle endurance<br>
of the printing plate supports furthermore plays a role<br>
during operation of the printing plate supports in order to<br>
be able to guarantee a long service life for the printing<br>
plate supports.<br>
Although the previously used AlMn alloys of the type<br>
AA3003, AA3103 have a good fatigue strength compared with<br>
the likewise used printing plate supports made of an<br>
aluminium alloy of the AA1050 type, the roughening<br><br>
performance during the preferably used electrochemical<br>
roughening is however poor, so that an aluminium alloy of<br>
the AA1050 type Is preferably used.<br>
A further development of the aluminium alloy of the AA1050<br>
type is now known from the German laid-open specification<br>
DE 199 56 692 Al in the name of the Applicant, the<br>
aluminium alloy comprising the following alloy constituents<br>
in wt.% besides aluminium:<br>
0.3 to 0.4 Fe,<br>
0.1 to 0.3 Mg,<br>
0.0 5 to 0.2b% Si,<br>
max. 0.05% Mn,<br>
max. 0.0 4% Cu.<br>
When producing lithographic printing plate supports from an<br>
aluminium strip with the composition mentioned above, it<br>
has now been found that a relatively high charge carrier<br>
input is needed before achieving homogeneous roughening, in<br>
particular for the preferably employed electrochemical<br>
roughening of the aluminium strip, so that the roughening<br>
process is very cost-intensive. It has furthermore been<br>
found that it is desirable to improve the mechanical<br>
properties of the aluminium alloy previously used to<br>
produce aluminium strips for lithographic printing plate<br>
supports. This relates in particular to the thermal<br>
stability of the printing plate supports after a burn-in<br>
process.<br>
Recent developments are aimed at increasing the manganese<br>
content of the aluminium alloy with the iron content<br><br>
remaining constant in order to achieve a nigher strength<br>
after the burn-in process. A corresponding aluminium alloy<br>
is known from the International Patent Application WO<br>
02/48415 Al . However, increased magnesium and manganese<br>
values of the aluminium alloy also entail problems with the<br>
electrochemical roughenability.<br>
On the basis of this, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide an aluminium strip for lithographic<br>
printing plate supports, from which print, ing plate supports<br>
can be produced with an improved roughenability and at the<br>
same time improved mechanical properties, particularly<br>
after a burn-in process. It is also an object to provide a<br>
method for producing an aluminium strip (or lithographic<br>
printing plate supports, as well as corresponding printing<br>
plate supports.<br>
The aforementioned object is achieved according to a first<br>
teaching of the present invention by an a l.uminium strip<br>
consisting of an aluminium alloy, i.n that the aluminium<br>
alloy has the following proportions of alloy constituents<br>
in wt.%:<br>
0 . 05% 
0.00 8% 
0.4% 
0.05% 
CN 
Ti 
inevitable impurities individually max. 0.01%, in<br>
total max. 0.05% and remainder Al.<br><br>
It has surprisingly been found that despite the high Fe<br>
content, the aluminium strip according to the invention on<br>
the one hand has very good properties in respect of<br>
eleotrochemically roughening the strip and on the other<br>
hand improved mechanical properties, in particular after<br>
carrying out a burn-in process. This is all the more<br>
surprising since the opinion in the specialist field was<br>
previously that there should only be an he content of at<br>
most 0.4 wt.% in an aluminium strip for 1 ithographic<br>
printing plate supports, so as to avoid causing nonuniform<br>
roughening of the; strip owing to coarse precipitate phases<br>
in the casting, welch are preferably attacked during the<br>
electrochemical toughening. It is likely that the<br>
precipitation of coarse phases in the casting does not<br>
occur for the aluminium strip according to the invention<br>
since a uniformly roughened structure is achieved by the<br>
electrochemical roughening. The Mg content of from<br>
0.05 wt.% to 0.3 wt.% in the aluminium strip according to<br>
the invention ensures recrystallisation of: the aluminium<br>
alloy already in the hot strip, which loads to a globulitic<br>
grain structure with small grain diameters. This results in<br>
a reduction of situation effects during the electrochemical<br>
roughening. At the same time, the Mg content in the<br>
aluminium alloy increases the roughening rate in an<br>
electrochemical toughening method, although with an Mg<br>
content of: more than 0.3 wt. % the accelerated etching<br>
attack can lead to an inhomogeneously roughened structure<br>
and the roughening process becomes problematic.<br>
Particularly in conjunction with the relatively high Fe<br>
contents of from 0.4 to 1.0 wt.%, the Mn content of from<br><br>
0.008 wt.% to 0.3 wt.% leads to an improvement in the<br>
thermal stability of the aluminium alloy, so that the<br>
strength of print ': ng plate supports produced from the<br>
aluminium alloy according to the invention after a burn-in<br>
process is increased. In combination with the high Fe<br>
content, the addition of manganese simultaneously leads to<br>
increased reactivity in the electrochemical roughening<br>
processes, but also in the pickling processes usually<br>
carried out before the electrochemical roughening. Overall,<br>
a lower charge carrier input is needed, for example in<br>
order to achieve complete roughening of an aluminium strip<br>
according to the invention, so that the process times for<br>
the electrochemical roughening and therefore the production<br>
costs for printing plate supports can be reduced.<br>
The Si content according to the invention of from 0.05 wt.%<br>
to 0.5 wt.% likewise affects the appearance of<br>
electrochemically roughened printing plate supports. If the<br>
Si content is too low, then too high a number of<br>
insufficiently small pits are formed in the aluminium<br>
strip. With too large an Si content, the number of pits in<br>
the roughened aJ uminium strip is too small. and the<br>
distribution is inhomogeneous.<br>
The Cu content of the aluminium alloy according to the<br>
invention must be restricted to at most 0.04 wt.% in order<br>
to avoid extremely inhomogeneous structures during the<br>
roughening. This also applies for the proportions of<br>
titanium usually entering the melt of the aluminium alloy<br>
via the grain refining materials. It is therefore necessary<br>
to restrict the TL content to at most 0.0 4 wt.%.<br>
Restricting the impurities of the aluminium alloy to<br><br>
individually at most 0.01 wt.% and in total at most<br>
0.05 wt.% leads to further stabilisation of the properties<br>
of the aluminium strip for lithographic printing plate<br>
supports, particularly in respect of manufacturing<br>
tolerances of the composition of the aluminium alloy and<br>
its process properties. The aluminium strip according to<br>
the invention is therefore highly suitable for producing<br>
Lithographic printing plate supports since besides very<br>
good roughening properties, at the same time it provides<br>
very good mechanical properties, particularly after<br>
carrying out burn-in processes.<br>
A further reduction of the charge carrier input necessary<br>
for achieving a homogeneously roughened surface is<br>
achieved, according to a first advantageous configuration<br>
of the aluminium alloy according to the invention, when the<br>
ratio of the proportions of the alloy constituents Fe/Mn is<br>
from 2 to 15, preferably from 3 to 8. The reason resides in<br>
the increased number of specific Fe- and Mn-containing<br>
precipitates which, besides the mechanical and thermal<br>
properties, also positively affects the reactivity when<br>
roughening the aluminium alloy.<br>
If the aluminium strip according to the invention has an Mn<br>
content in wt.% oi 0.008% 
0.008% 
their thermal stability after a burn-in process at the same<br>
time, the susceptibility to inhomogeneity after<br>
electrochemical roughening can at the sano time be reduced <br>
further.<br><br><br>
In the same way, the roughening behaviour of the aluminium<br>
strip according 10 the invention can be improved when the<br>
aluminium alloy has a Ti content in wt. % of at most 0.01%.<br>
Lastly, it has been found that the thermal stability of the<br>
aluminium strip can be improved further in respect of the<br>
strength values after a burn-in process when the ratio of<br>
the proportions of the alloy constituents Fe/Si is at least<br>
2 .<br>
In order to improve the handleability of the printing plate<br>
supports produced from an aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention, according to a next advantageous embodiment, the<br>
aluminium strip according to the invention has a yield<br>
point Rp0.2 of at least 18 0 MPa and a tensile strength Rm<br>
of at least 190 MPa in the rolling direction and/or a yield<br>
point Rp0.2 of at least 190 MPa and a tensile strength Rm<br>
of at least 200 MPa transversely to the rolling direction<br>
at room temperature.<br>
If the aluminium strip according to the invention after a<br>
heat treatment at 240°C for 10 min. has a yield point Rp0.2<br>
of at least 140 MPa and a tensile strength Rm of at least<br>
150 MPa transversely to or in the rolling direction, then<br>
the aluminium strip according to the invention is suitable<br>
in particular for lithographic printing plate supports for<br>
particularly large printing runs, since these are intended<br>
to lose as little strength as possible after the burn-in<br>
process.<br>
The aluminium strip according to the invention is further<br>
improved according to a further configuration when the<br><br>
bonding cycle endurance of the aluminium strip in the<br>
rolling direction is more than 3000 bending cycles,<br>
preferably more than 3200 bending cycles in the rolling<br>
direction. The alluminium strip according to the invention<br>
achieves the said number of bending cycles in the rolling<br>
direction particularly in the mill-hard state and therefore<br>
significantly surpasses conventional aluminium strips in<br>
the mill-hard stale. The bending cycle endurance was<br>
measured by taking samples with a length of 100 mm and a<br>
width of 20 mm from the aluminium strip, with the<br>
longitudinal axis of the samples corresponding to the<br>
rolling direction. The samples were then subjected to<br>
alternating flexion by a machine over a radius of 30 mm and<br>
the number of bends until fracture was determined. The<br>
number of bends is a measure of the stability of a printing<br>
plate support manufactured from the aluminium strip during<br>
the printing process. In the present case, the number of<br>
bending cycles was determined statistically from 12<br>
samples. The aluminium strip according to the invention<br>
therefore makes it possible to manufacture printing plate<br>
supports with a particularly long service life.<br>
A further extended service life of printing plate supports<br>
produced from the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention is achieved when the bending cycle endurance of<br>
the aluminium strip after a heat treatment at 240°C for 10<br>
min. in the rolling direction is more than 3300 bending<br>
cycles, preferably more than 3400 bending cycles in the<br>
rolling direction. The reason for the increase in the<br>
bending cycles resides on the one hand in the softening of<br>
the aluminium strip during the burn-in process but also on<br><br>
the other hand in the thermal stability of the aluminium<br>
strip according to the invention.<br>
Lastly, an electrochemical roughening process of the<br>
aluminium strip, which is usually carried out for producing<br>
printing plate supports, is improved when the aluminium<br>
strip has a surface comprising fine globulitic grains with<br>
more than 250 grains per mm2, preferably more than 350<br>
grains per mm2. A fine-grained structure with the specified<br>
grain density leads to a more homogeneous appearance in the<br>
roughened or coated state. This accelerates the roughening<br>
process overall. The grain structure may, for example, be<br>
achieved by the production method according to the<br>
invention by rolling factors specially adjusted after<br>
intermediate annealing during cold rolling to final<br>
thickness.<br>
According to a second teaching of the present invention,<br>
the stated object is achieved by the use of an aluminium<br>
strip according t o the invention for producing printing<br>
plate supports. With respect to the advantages of the use<br>
according to the invention of the aluminium strip,<br>
reference is made to the comments above regarding the<br>
aluminium strip according to the invention.<br>
The object stated above is achieved according to a third<br>
teaching of the present invention by a method for producing<br>
an aluminium strip, in that a rolling ingot of an aluminium<br>
alloy having the following alloy constituents in wt. % :<br>
0.05% 
0.008% 
 <br><br>
inevitable impurities individually max. 0.01%, in<br>
total max. 0.05% and remainder Al<br>
is cast continuously or in batches, the rolling ingot is<br>
optionally preheated or homogenised before hot rolling, the<br>
rolling ingot is hot-rolled to form a hot strip and the hot<br>
strip is cold-rolled to final thickness with or without<br>
intermediate annealing. In this case, after casting, the<br>
casting skin of the rolling ingot is generally milled off<br>
in order to improve the purity and uniformity of the<br>
aluminium strip before the hot and cold forming, and the<br>
final rolling is earried out with finely ground steel,<br>
rolls. A heat pretreatment or homogenisation may preferably<br>
take place at temperatures of from 380°C to 600°C before<br>
the hot rolling. Furthermore, the hot strip final<br>
temperature is preferably between 280 and 370°C.<br>
A state optimised for processing the aluminium strip to<br>
form printing plate supports and their use is achieved<br>
according to another configuration of the method according<br>
to the invention when at least one intermediate anneal is<br>
carried out during the cold rolling and the rolling factor<br>
to final thickness is between 65% and 855 after the<br>
intermediate anneal. This sets up an optimised state<br>
between soft-annealed and mill-hard so that the aluminium<br>
strip on the one hand has sufficient strength values, in<br>
particular after a burn-in process. On the other hand, a<br><br>
fine-grained surface can be provided, so that a more<br>
homogeneous appearance is ensured after :.ne roughening.<br>
The final, thickness of the aluminium strip is preferably<br>
from 0.15 mm to 0.5 mm, in particular from 0.15 mm to<br>
0.35 mm. Particularly in the case of small thicknesses,<br>
with an aluminium strip produced by the method according to<br>
the invention, an aluminium strip optimised for the<br>
production of printing plate supports can be provided,<br>
since it has an improved roughening behaviour together with<br>
improved thermal stability and improved strength values.<br>
In order to produce an aluminium strip for lithographic<br>
printing plate supports, the finally rolled aluminium strip<br>
is subjected to dogreasing with an alkaline or acidic<br>
medium after the rolling and the degreased aluminium strip<br>
is electrochemically roughened. The roughening of the<br>
aluminium strip is preferably carried out in baths of<br>
nitric acid HNO3 or hydrochloric acid HCl . Furthermore, the<br>
electrochemical roughening may also be carried out in mixed<br>
acid solutions.<br>
In order to prepare the finally rolled aluminium strip<br>
optimally for the subsequent electrochemical roughening<br>
process, particularly thorough degreasino is necessary. To<br>
this end, the aluminium strip is preferaoly degreased with<br>
a degreasing medium which contains at least 1.5 to 3 wt.%<br>
of a composition of 5 to 4 0 wt.% of sodium polyphosphate, 3<br>
to 10 wt.% of sodium gluconate, 30 to 70 of sodium<br>
carbonate and 3 to 8 wt.% of a mixture of a nonionic<br>
surfactant and an ionic surfactant. The dogreasing medium<br>
ensures on the one hand virtually complete removal of<br><br>
possibly existing colling oil residues. On the other hand,<br>
the slightly pickking nature of the degroasing medium<br>
dissolves the rolling oxide layer of the aluminium strip.<br>
Lastly, the object stated above is achieved according to a<br>
fourth teaching of the invention by a printing plate<br>
support produced from an aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention, which has preferably been produced by the method<br>
according to the invention. As already mentioned above,<br>
printing plate supports according to the invention have an<br>
improved service life and an improved roughening behaviour<br>
compared with conventional printing plate supports.<br>
There are now many possibilities for refining and<br>
configuring the aluminium alloy according to the invention,<br>
the aluminium strip according to the invention and the<br>
method according to the invention for producing an<br>
aluminium strip for lithographic printing plate supports.<br>
To this end, reference is made on the one hand to the<br>
claims dependent on Claims 1 and 11 and on the other hand<br>
to the following description of exemplary embodiments .<br>
Table 1 now represents the studied aluminium alloys and<br>
their compositions in respect of the alloy constituents Fe,<br>
Mn and Mg. The aluminium alloys V402 and V404 have a<br>
composition corresponding to the prior art and are<br>
therefore used as comparative alloys. The rolling ingots<br>
consisting of the various aluminium alloys specified in<br>
Table 1 were hot-rolled to a thickness of 4.0 mm, after<br>
removing the casting skin and preheating, then subjected to<br>
cold rolling to a final thickness of 0.3 mm and optionally<br>
intermediately annealed between two cold rolling runs.<br><br>
Aluminium strips wore respectively produced in the H18<br>
state with an intermediate anneal at 2.2 mm and in the H19<br>
state without an intermediate anneal.<br><br>
Both the aluminium strips produced with intermediate<br>
annealing and those produced without intermediate annealing<br>
were subjected to tensile tests according to DIN EN 10002,<br>
which were carried out both at room temperature and after a<br>
burn-in process at 240°C for 10 min. The results of the<br>
tensile tests are represented on the one hand for aluminium<br>
strips with intermediate annealing in Table 2 (Test No. 1<br>
to 8) and on the other hand without intermediate annealing<br>
in Table 3 (Test Ko. 9 to 16). For the aluminium strips<br>
produced with intermediate annealing, it is found by<br>
comparison between the comparative aluminium strips of<br>
Tests No. 1 and 3 that the yield point Ro0.2 and the<br>
tensile strength of the aluminium strips increase with<br>
increasing iron and manganese contents. The thermal<br>
stability, i.e. the yield point Rp 0.2 and the tensile<br>
strength Rm after a burn-in process, do root however change.<br>
In contrast to this, the aluminium strips according to the<br><br>
invention show in comparison with the comparative alloy<br>
strips of Tests Wo. 9 and 11 on the one hand an increase in<br>
the yield point Ro 0.2 and the tensile strength Rm and on<br>
the other hand likewise increased values for the yield<br>
point RpO. 2 and the tensile strength Rm after a burn-in<br>
process at 240°C for 10 min.<br>
The increase in the thermal stability due to the<br>
combination according to the invention of high Fe content<br>
and increased Mn contents in Tests No. 13 to 16 may be seen<br>
particularly clearly. Although with virtually identical Fe<br>
contents Tests No. 13 and 14 already show an increased<br>
yield point Rp 0.2 after a thermal burn-in orocess compared<br>
with conventional aluminium strips, the yield point Rp0.2<br>
nevertheless rises further with an increasing Mn content as<br>
shown by Tests lb and 16.<br>
Surprisingly, the increase in the thermal stability after a<br>
burn-in process is particularly impressive especially with<br>
high Fe and Mn values (cf. Test No. 16) in the H19 state.<br>
The values for the yield point Rp 0.2 increase from below<br>
140 MPa to about 150 MPa and those for the tensile strength<br>
from 140 MPa to about 160 MPa.<br><br><br><br>
Table 4 now represents the results for the roughening<br>
behaviour of the aluminium alloys according to the<br>
invention compared with the previously used aluminium<br>
alloys of Tests do. 17 and 19. The results of the<br>
roughening tests of the aluminium strips produced with and<br>
without intermediate annealing have been compiled<br>
qualitatively in the table. The roughening was carried out<br>
in an HNO3 bath, which in particular reacts more<br>
sensitively to striations or inhomogeneities which may<br>
occur. The roughening behaviour of the melts preferably<br>
used in the past, from Tests No. 17 and 19, were used as a<br>
reference for the level of the charge carrier input and<br>
were evaluated as satisfactory "o". A reduced charge<br>
carrier input to achieve surface-wide roughening was<br>
evaluated with a "t". A "+" therefore denotes a reduction<br>
of" the charge carier input, a " + + " denotes a stronger<br>
reduction and a "+++" denotes a substantial reduction of<br>
the charge carries input. The homogeneity of the roughening<br>
was furthermore evaluated. Here again, the aluminium alloys<br>
with Test No. 17 and 19 were used as a reference and<br>
evaluated as satisfactory "o". Particularly in the range of<br>
the Fe/Mn ratio from 2 to 15 and 3 to 8, respectively, the<br>
values of the charge carrier input for homogeneous<br>
roughening of the aluminium strip are reduced. In the tests<br>
under laboratory conditions, a reduction of the charge<br>
carrier input by up to 25% below the usua1 charge carrier<br>
input was achieved with the aluminium alloys according to<br>
the invention. Al the same time a further improved<br>
homogeneity of the roughening is found, especially in Tests<br>
No. 22 and 24.<br><br><br>
As a result, both the roughening behaviour and the<br>
homogeneity of the roughening can be improved substantially<br>
by the aluminium alloy according to the invention. Since<br>
the aluminium alloy according to the invention at the same<br>
time has good or oven better mechanical properties,<br>
particularly after a burn-in process, when producing<br>
printing plate supports not only more economical but also<br>
improved products, i.e. improved printinq plate supports,<br>
can be produced with a reduction in process times.<br>
Further studies were carried out on an additional exemplary<br>
embodiment of the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention compared with a conventional aluminium strip for<br>
lithographic prinding plate supports. The alloy<br>
constituents of the aluminium alloys usee are reported in<br>
Table 5.<br><br><br>
Aluminium strips in the H18 state were likewise produced<br>
from the V486 and V488 melts, an intermediate anneal thus<br>
taking place during the cold rolling. In contrast to the<br>
previous exemplary embodiments, the rolling factor to final<br>
thickness after the intermediate anneal was restricted to<br>
65% to 85%.<br>
The yield point Rp 0.2 and the tensile strength in the<br>
rolling direction (1) and transversely to the rolling<br>
direction (t) were measured as a function of the<br>
temperature of a burn-in process. The results are reported<br>
in Table 6.<br><br>
It is found that the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention, in conjunction with the method parameters<br>
according to the invention, has an improved yield point<br>
both transversely and longitudinally to the rolling<br><br>
direction compared with the conventional aluminium strip,<br>
as expected.<br>
When studying the surface grain structure of the aluminium<br>
strip, it was moreover also found that despite the method<br>
parameters being the same, the aluminium strip according to<br>
the invention has a significantly smaller average grain<br>
diameter of 54 µm and the number of globu1itic grains on<br>
the surface is 391 per mm2. In this context, the<br>
conventional strip achieves only a grain number of 123 per<br>
mm2 with an average grain diameter of 95 µm. The grain<br>
stretching was similar for both aluminium strips, i.e. 2.3<br>
(Al strip according to the invention) and 2.9 (conventional<br>
Al strip). The substantially finer grain structure of the<br>
aluminium strip according to the invention leads to a<br>
significantly more homogeneous appearance after roughening<br>
in electrochemical roughening.<br>
In the subsequently performed measurements of the bending<br>
cycle endurance in the rolling direction, the exemplary<br>
embodiment of the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention produced from the V488 melt achieved 3390 bending<br>
cycles in the mill-hard state after burning-in at 240°C/10<br>
min and even 4060 bending cycles after burning-in at<br>
2 60°C/4 min. For comparison, the conventional aluminium<br>
strip produced from the V486 melt achieved only 2830<br>
bending cycles when mill-hard and 2950 ana 3250 bending<br>
cycles, respectively, after burn-in processes at 240°C/10<br>
min. and 2 60° C/4 min. The rise in the number of bending<br>
cycles is at max i rum about 25% compared with the<br>
conventional aluminium strip. Overall, a significant<br>
increase in the service lives of the printing plate<br><br>
supports produced from the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention is thus possible.<br><br>
