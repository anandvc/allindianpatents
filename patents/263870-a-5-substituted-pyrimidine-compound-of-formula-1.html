				<td>HIV IN flBITING 5-SUBSTITUTED PYRIMIDINES<br>
The present invention is concerned with pyramiding derivatives having HIV (Human<br>
Immunodeficiency Virus) replication inhibiting properties. The invention further relates<br>
to methods for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of said compounds in the prevention or the<br>
treatment of HIV infection.<br>
Resistance of the HIV virus against currently available HIV drugs continues to be a<br>
major cause of therapy failure. This has led to the introduction of combination therapy<br>
of two or more anti-HIV agents usually having a different activity profile. Significant<br>
progress was made by the introduction of HAART therapy (Highly Active Anti-<br>
Retroviral Therapy), which has resulted in a significant reduction of morbidity and<br>
mortality in HIV patient populations treated therewith. HAART involves various<br>
combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (Pies). Current<br>
guidelines for antiretroviral therapy recommend such triple combination therapy<br>
regimen for initial treatment. However, these multidrug therapies do not completely<br>
eliminate HIV and long-term treatment usually results in multidrug resistance. In<br>
particular, half of the patients receiving anti-HTV combination therapy do not respond<br>
fully to the treatment, mainly because of resistance of the virus to one or more drugs<br>
used. It also has been shown that resistant virus is carried over to newly infected<br>
individuals, resulting in severely limited therapy options for these drug-naive patients.<br>
Therefore there is a continued need for new combinations of active ingredients that are<br>
effective against HIV. New types of anti-HIV effective active ingredients, differing in<br>
chemical structure and activity profile are useful in new types of combination therapy<br>
Finding such active ingredients therefore is a highly desirable goal to achieve.<br>
The present invention is aimed at providing particular novel series of pyramiding<br>
derivatives having HTV replication inhibiting properties. WO 99/50250 , WO 00/27825<br>
and WO 01/85700 disclose certain substituted aminopyrimidines and WO 99/50256<br>
and EP-834 507 disclose aminotriazines having HIV replication inhibiting properties.<br>
The compounds of the invention differ from prior art compounds in structure,<br>
pharmacological activity and/or pharmacological potency. It has been found that the<br>
introduction of certain substituents in the 5-position of specifically substituted<br>
pyrimidines results in compounds the compounds not only acting favorably in terms of<br>
their capability to inhibit the replication of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), but<br>
also by their improved ability to inhibit the replication of mutant strains, in particular<br>
strains which have become resistant to one or more known NNRTI drugs (Non<br>
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor drugs), which strains are referred to as drug<br>
or multidrug resistant HIV strains.<br>
Thus in one aspect, the present invention concerns compounds of formula<br>
the N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines or<br>
stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, wherein<br>
A is -CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH-, -CsC-;<br>
each R1 independently is hydrogen, aryl, formyl, C1-6alkylcarbonyl, d-gallcyl,<br>
C1-6alkyloxycarbonyl;<br>

di(C1-6aIkyl)amino, polyhalomethyl;<br>
R3 is H, C1-6alkyl, halo;<br>
R4 is H, C1-6alkyl, halo;<br>
R5 is nitro, amino, mono- and diCMalkylamino, aryl, halo, -CO-H, -CO-R6, -COOR7,<br>
-NH-C(=O)H, -NH-C(=O)R6, -CH=N-O-R8;<br>
R6 is C1-4alkyl, amino, mono- or di(C1-4alkyl)amino, or polyhaloC1-4alkyl;<br>
R7 is hydrogen, CMalkyl, arylC1-6alkyl;<br>
R8 is hydrogen, C1-6alkyl, aryl;<br>
each p is 1 or 2;<br>
each aryl is phenyl or phenyl substituted with one, two, three, four or five substftuents<br>
each independently selected from halo, hydroxy, mercapto, C1-6aDtyl, hydroxy-<br>
Cj^alkyl, aminoC1-6alkyl, mono or alkyIcarbonyl,<br>
alkyloxycarbonyl, C1-6alkylthio, cyano, nitro,<br>
polyhaloCi-galkyl, polyhaloC1-6alkyloxy, aminocarbonyl.<br>
As used hereinbefore or hereinafter Chalky! as a group or part of a group defines<br>
straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon<br>
-3-<br>
atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, 1-methylethyl, bulyl; Ci-ealkyl as a group or part<br>
of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the group defined for C1-4alky! and pentyl, hexyl,<br>
2-methylbutyl and the like; Ci-zalkyl defines methyl or ethyl; C3-7cycloalkyl is generic<br>
to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. Preferred<br>
amongst Ci-ealkyl are C1-4alky! or C1-2aHcyl.<br>
As used herein before, the term (=O) forms a carbonyl moiety when attached to a<br>
carbon atom, a sulfoxide moiety when attached to a sulfur atom and a sulfonyl moiety<br>
when two of said terms are attached to a sulfur atom.<br>
The terms carboxyl, carboxy or hydroxycarbonyl refer to a group -COOH.<br>
The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing<br>
and hereinafter, polyhalomethyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or<br>
polyhalosubstituted methyl, in particular methyl with one or more fluoro atoms, for<br>
example, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl; polyhaloCMalkyl or<br>
polyhaloC1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted<br>
C1-4alky! or C1-6alkyl, for example, the groups defined in halomethyl,<br>
1,1 -difluoro-ethyl, 2,2,2-trifluorethyl, pentafluorbethyl and the like. In case more than<br>
one halogen atoms are attached to an alkyl group within the definition of polyhalomethyl,<br>
polyhaloCMalkyl or polyhaloCi-ealkyl, they may be the same or different.<br>
Whenever it occurs in the definition of the compounds of formula (I) or in any of the<br>
subgroups specified herein, each aryl independently is as specified above in the<br>
definition of the compounds of formulas (I) or in the more restricted definitions of aryl<br>
as specified hereinafter.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any radical, each definition of such<br>
variable is independent.<br>
Any of the restrictions in the definitions of the radicals herein are meant to be<br>
applicable to the group of compounds of formula (I) as well as to any subgroup defined<br>
or mentioned herein.<br>
Lines drawn from substituents into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached<br>
to any of the suitable ring atoms.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counter<br>
ion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases, which are nonpharmaceutically<br>
acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or<br>
purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to<br>
comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by<br>
treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example,<br>
hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid;<br>
phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic,<br>
2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic,<br>
fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy-l,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic,<br>
ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic,<br>
2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt<br>
form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing acidic protons may be converted into their<br>
therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with<br>
appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for<br>
example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium,<br>
sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g.<br>
primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine,<br>
ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine,<br>
diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine,<br>
di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine,<br>
tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine,<br>
W-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, hydrabarm'ne<br>
salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid<br>
form. The term addition salt also comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms<br>
which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g.<br>
hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium<br>
salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic<br>
nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as,<br>
for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g.<br>
methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be<br>
used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfo nates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl<br>
p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate<br>
and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
The JV-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of<br>
formula (I) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called<br>
TV-oxide.<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) and their .TV-oxides,<br>
addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one<br>
or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the<br>
possible stereoisomeric forms, which the compounds of formula (I), and their .TV-oxides,<br>
addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess.<br>
Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds<br>
denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures<br>
containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as<br>
each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I) and their A^-oxides, salts, solvates<br>
or quaternary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably<br>
less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other<br>
isomers. Thus, when a compound of formula (I) is for instance specified as (E), this<br>
means that the compound is substantially free of the (Z) isomer. In particular,<br>
stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic<br>
(partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or fra/iv-configuration.<br>
Compounds having double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusammen)<br>
-stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well<br>
known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are meant to be<br>
embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such<br>
forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of formula (I)" is meant to also<br>
include their jV-oxide forms, their salts, their quaternary amines and their<br>
stereochemically isomeric forms. Of special interest are those compounds of formula<br>
(I), which are stereochemically pure.<br>
Particular subgroups of compounds of formula (I) or any of the subgroups of<br>
compounds of formula (I) specified herein which are the non-salt-forms, the salts, the<br>
N-oxide forms and stereochemically isomeric forms. Of interest amongst these are the<br>
non-salt-forms, the salts and stereochemically isomeric forms. As used herein, the term<br>
'non-salt-form' refers to the form of a compound which is not a salt, which in most<br>
cases will be the free base form.<br>
Whenever mention is made hereinbefore or hereinafter that substituents can be selected<br>
each independently out of a list of numerous definitions, such as for example for R9 and<br>
R10, all possible combinations are intended which are chemically possible or which lead<br>
to chemically stable molecules.<br>
It is to be understood that any of the subgroups of compounds of formulae (I) as<br>
defined herein, are meant to also comprise any prodrugs, .TV-oxides, addition salts,<br>
quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms of such<br>
compounds.<br>

Of particular interest are those compounds of formula (I) or any of the subgroups of<br>
compounds of formula (I) wherein A is -CH=CH- and wherein the substituents on A<br>
are in an E-configuration (i.e. so-called 'E'-isomers).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula<br>
(II) wherein Wi represents a suitable leaving group, such as for example halogen, e.g.<br>
chloro, bromo, a tosyl, mesyl and the like groups, with an intermediate of formula (in).<br>
The reaction of the pyrimidine derivative (II) with the amine (in) is typically conducted<br>
in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents are for example an alcohol, such<br>
as for example ethanol, 2-propanol; a dipolar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile,<br>
A^V-dimethylformamide; JV^-dimethylacetamide, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone; an ether<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, propylene glycol monomethylether. The reaction<br>
can be done under acid conditions obtained by adding amounts of a suitable acid such<br>
as for example camphor sulfonic acid, or by using acid solvents, e.g. hydrochloric acid<br>
dissolved in an alkanol such as 1- or 2-propanol.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by forming the Xi linkage by either<br>
reacting (TV-a) with (V-a) or (TV-b) with (V-b) as outlined in the following scheme.<br>
In this reaction scheme Wi represents an appropriate leaving group, which in particular<br>
is as specified above.<br>
In particular, compounds of formula (I) wherein Xi represents NR1, said compounds<br>
being represented by formula (I-a), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula (IV-c), wherein Wi is an appropriate leaving group, e.g. chloro or bromo, with<br>
-10-<br>
an intermediate of formula (V-c). The leaving group Wi may also be introduced in situ,<br>
e.g. by converting the corresponding hydroxy function into a leaving group for example<br>
by POCb. The reaction of (IV-c) with (V-c) preferably is conducted in a suitable<br>
solvent in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine. Suitable solvents are for example<br>
acetonitrile, alcohols, such as for example ethanol, 2-propanol, ethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, polar aprotic solvents such as A^-dimethylformamide;<br>
A^V-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsufoxide, 1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,<br>
ethers such as 1,4-dioxane, propylene glycol monomethylether.<br>

The reaction of (IV-a) or (FV-b) with (V-a) or (V-b) is also suited in the instance where<br>
Xi is -O- or -S-. In particular, compounds of formula (I) wherein Xi represents O, said<br>
compounds being represented by formula (I-b), can be prepared by reacting an<br>
intermediate of formula (VI) wherein Wi represents a suitable leaving group, such as<br>
for example halo, e.g. chloro and the like, with an intermediate of formula (VII) in the<br>
presence of a suitable base, such as for example K^COa or potassium f-butoxide<br>
(KO f-Bu), and a suitable solvent, such as for example acetone or tetrahydrofuran. In a<br>
particular execution, intermediate (VII) is first reacted under stirring at room<br>
temperature with a suitable metal hydride in an organic solvent. Subsequently, an<br>
intermediate (VI), wherein -Wi is a suitable leaving group or a precursor of a leaving<br>
group, is added.<br>
Compounds of formula (I-b) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula (TV-e) with an intermediate of formula (V-d) in the presence of POCk, a<br>
suitable base, such as for example KaCOs or potassium ^-butoxide (KO t-Bu), and a<br>
suitable solvent, such as for example acetone or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
(I-b)<br>
The thio-compounds (Xj is -S-) can be obtained in a similar manner and can<br>
conveniently be transferred to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone using art-known<br>
oxidation procedures.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-c), which are compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is<br>
aryl, can also be prepared by reacting a compound (I-d) wherein Wi represents a<br>
suitable leaving group, such as for example halogen, e.g. chloro, bromo, with an aryl<br>
radical with special groups such as boronic acid (i.e. -B(OH)2) or borate esters (i.e.<br>
-B(OR)2 wherein R is alkyl or alkylene, e.g. R is methyl, ethyl or ethylene). This type<br>
of reaction can be typically conducted in the presence of a copper salt, in particular<br>
copper(II) acetate, and a suitable quencher like pyridine may be added to the reaction<br>
mixture.<br>
The compounds (I-d-1) which are compounds of formula (I-d) wherein W1 is halo are<br>
prepared for example by halogenating a corresponding starting material of formula (VI)<br>
which can be prepared as described in WO-03/016306. Other leaving groups can be<br>
introduced by replacing the halo group using suitable reagents.<br>
The compounds (I-d-1) can be converted in the corresponding compounds (I-e), which<br>
have a group -COOR in the 5-position of the pyrimidine moiety. The compounds (I-e)<br>
in turn can be converted in the corresponding amides (I-f).<br>
The compounds (I-g), which are compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is a nitro group,<br>
can be converted by a nitro to amino reduction in the corresponding compounds (I-h),<br>
which have an amino group in the 5-position of the pyrimidine moiety. The compounds<br>
(I-h) in turn can be converted in the corresponding amides (I-i) using an appropriate<br>
acylation reaction.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-j), which are compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is<br>
-CHO can be prepared by reacting compounds (I-d-1) with pressurized CO gas in the<br>
5 presence of sodium formate and a suitable catalyst, e.g. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)-<br>
palladium(II).<br><br>
The compounds (I-j) can be reacted with hydroxylamine to compounds (I-k) which in<br>
turn can be alkylated to yield compounds (1-1) wherein R5 is an alkylated oxime. The<br>
compounds (I-j) can also be converted directly to compounds (1-1) by reacting the<br>
starting compounds (I-j) with an alkyl hydroxylamine.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may further be prepared by converting compounds of<br>
formula (I) into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding JV-oxide forms<br>
following art-known procedures for converting a tertiary nitrogen into its JV-oxide<br>
form. Said JV-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting<br>
material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate<br>
inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth<br>
alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate<br>
organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic<br>
acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic<br>
acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g.<br>
tertbutyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols,<br>
e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone,<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 or R4 is hydrogen, can be converted into a<br>
compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 or R4 represents halo, by reaction with a suitable<br>
halo-introducing agent, such as for example .TV-chlorosuccinimide or<br>
AT-borosuccinimide, or a combination thereof, in the presence of a suitable solvent, such<br>
as for example acetic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 represents Ci^alkyloxycarbonyl, can be<br>
converted into a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents hydrogen, by reaction<br>
with a suitable base, such as for example sodium hydroxide or methoxide. Where R1 is<br>
tbutyloxycarbonyl, the corresponding compounds wherein R1 is hydrogen can be made<br>
by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present invention<br>
may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric<br>
forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of<br>
art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical<br>
methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter<br>
current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be<br>
obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable<br>
resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts<br>
or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or<br>
compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques,<br>
e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated<br>
diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure<br>
stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the<br>
intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid<br>
chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials are known compounds and may be<br>
commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula<br>
(VIII) wherein Wi is defined as hereinabove, with an intermediate of formula (EX) in<br>
the presence of a suitable solvent, such as for example tetrahydrofuran, and optionally<br>
in the presence of a suitable base, such as for example NaaCOs.<br>
Intermediates of formula (VIEI) can be prepared in accordance with art-known<br>
procedures.<br>
The intermediates (V-a) and (V-b) can be prepared as follows :<br>
Intermediates of formula (III) or (TV-a) wherein R1 is hydrogen or Xi is NH, said<br>
intermediates being represented by formula (Ill-a) and (IV-a-1), can be prepared by<br>
reacting an intermediate of formula (XI) or (XII) with a suitable reducing agent, such as<br>
Fe, in the presence of NH4C1 and a suitable solvent, such as for example<br>
tetrahydrofuran, FbO and an alcohol, e.g. methanol and the like.<br>
Intermediates of formula (in-a) wherein A represents -CHa-QHb-, said intermediates<br>
being represented by formula (ffl-a-l), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula (XII-a) with Pd/C in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as for example an<br>
alcohol, e.g. ethanol and the like.<br>
Intermediates of formula (XII-a), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula (XIII) with diethylcyanomethylphosphonate in the presence of a suitable base,<br>
such as for example NaOCH3, and a suitable solvent, such as for example<br>
tetrahydroiuran.<br>
Intermediates of formula (Xin) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula<br>
(XIV) with a suitable oxidizing agent, such as for example MnOj, in the presence of a<br>
suitable solvent, such as for example acetone.<br>
Intermediates of formula (XTV) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula<br>
(XV) with NaBFLt in the presence of ethylchloroformate, a suitable base, such as for<br>
example A^-diethylethanamine, and a suitable solvent, such as for example<br>
tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Intermediates of formula (XI) and (XII) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula (XVT) respectively (XVII) with HNO3 , NaNO3 or KNO3 in the presence of<br>
H2SO4, AcOH or CH3SO3H.<br>
Intermediates of formula (V-b) wherein Xi is O and R5 is bromo, said intermediate<br>
being represented by formula (V-b-1), can be prepared from intermediates (XVIII) by<br>
reaction with Bra in the presence of a suitable base, such as for example<br>
AyV-diethylethanamine, and a suitable solvent, such as for example dimethylsulfoxide.<br>
Intermediates of formula (V-b-1) can be converted into an intermediate of formula<br>
(V-a) wherein R5 and Wi represent chloro, said intermediate being represented by<br>
formula (V-a-1), by reaction with<br>
POCU<br>
(V-b-1) (V-a-l)<br>
Intermediates of formula (in-a), wherein A is -CH=CH- and Xi is NH or O, said<br>
intermediates being represented by formula (III-a-2) respectively (III-a-3), may also be<br>
prepared from an intermediate of formula (XK) respectively (XX) by reaction with<br>
H2C=CH-CN in the presence of Pd(OAc)2, P(o-Tol)3, a suitable base, such as for<br>
example A^-diethylethanamine, and a suitable solvent, such as for example CHa-CN.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) show antiretroviral properties (reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibiting properties), in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),<br>
which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in<br>
humans. The HTV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or<br>
changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As<br>
a result, an infected patient has an ever decreasing number of T-4 cells, which<br>
moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defence system is unable to<br>
combat infections and neoplasms and the HTV infected subject usually dies by<br>
opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated<br>
with HIV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the<br>
central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in<br>
dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HIV<br>
infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive<br>
generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC).<br>
The present compounds also show activity against (multi) drug resistant HTV strains, in<br>
particular (multi) drug resistant HTV-1 strains, more in particular the present<br>
compounds show activity against HIV strains, especially HTV-1 strains that have<br>
acquired resistance to one or more art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitors. Art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are those<br>
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors other than the present compounds and<br>
known to the person skilled in the art, in particular commercial non-nucleoside reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors. The present compounds also have little or no binding affinity<br>
to human ot-1 acid glycoprotein; human a-1 acid glycoprotein does not or only weakly<br>
affect the anti HTV activity of the present compounds.<br>
Due to their antiretroviral properties, particularly their anti-HIV properties, especially<br>
their anti-HIV-1-activity, the compounds of formula (I), their W-oxides,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms thereof, are useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HTV and<br>
for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present<br>
invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with<br>
viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the enzyme reverse<br>
transcriptase. Conditions which may be prevented or treated with the compounds of the<br>
present invention, especially conditions associated with HTV and other pathogenic<br>
retroviruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), progressive generalized<br>
lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic Central Nervous System diseases caused<br>
by retroviruses, such as, for example HTV mediated dementia and multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used<br>
as medicines against above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of<br>
treatment comprises the administration to HTV-infected subjects of an amount effective<br>
to combat the conditions associated with HTV and other pathogenic retroviruses,<br>
, the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HIV infections.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of<br>
treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from or a method of<br>
preventing warm-blooded animals, including humans, to suffer from viral infections,<br>
especially HTV infections. Said method comprises the administration, preferably oral<br>
administration, of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a W-oxide form, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine or a possible<br>
stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions for treating viral infections<br>
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated<br>
into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate<br>
compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically<br>
administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an<br>
effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the<br>
active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of<br>
preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally,<br>
rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the<br>
compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be<br>
employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of<br>
oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or<br>
solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders,<br>
disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise<br>
sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid<br>
solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in<br>
which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and<br>
glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case<br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also<br>
included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before<br>
use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous<br>
administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a<br>
suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in<br>
minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on<br>
the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be<br>
helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be<br>
administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or<br>
insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for<br>
administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry<br>
powder. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry<br>
powders via oral or nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of<br>
the present compounds.<br>
To aid solubility of the compounds of formula (I), suitable ingredients, e.g. cyclodextrins,<br>
may be included in the compositions. Appropriate cyclodextrins are a-, (3-,<br>
y-cyclodextrins or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy<br>
groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with Chalky!,<br>
particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated P-CD; hydroxy-<br>
Ci-ealkyl, particularly hydroxyethyl, hydroxy-propyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxy-<br>
Ci-ealkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxy-ethyl; Ci^alkylcarbonyl, particularly<br>
acetyl. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are P-CD, randomly<br>
methylated P-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-p-CD,<br>
2-hydroxypropyl-p-CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-p-CD, and in particular<br>
2-hydroxypropyl-p-CD (2-HP-P-CD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin<br>
hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example,<br>
hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
The average molar substitution (M.S'.) is used as a measure of the average number of<br>
moles of alkoxy units per mole of anhydroglucose. The average substitution degree<br>
(D.S1.) refers to the average number of substituted hydroxyls per anhydroglucose unit.<br>
The M.S. and D.S. value can be determined by various analytical techniques such as<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared<br>
spectroscopy (IR). Depending on the technique used, slightly different values may be<br>
obtained for one given cyclodextrin derivative. Preferably, as measured by mass<br>
spectrometry, the M.S. ranges from 0.125 to 10 and the D.S. ranges from 0.125 to 3.<br>
Other suitable compositions for oral or rectal administration comprise particles<br>
consisting of a solid dispersion comprising a compound of formula (I) and one or more<br>
appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" used hereinafter defines a system in a solid state (as<br>
opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, in casu the<br>
compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer, wherein one component is<br>
dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components (in case<br>
additional pharmaceutically acceptable formulating agents, generally known in the art,<br>
are included, such as plasticizers, preservatives and the like). When said dispersion of<br>
the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or<br>
homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermo-dynamics, such a<br>
solid dispersion will be called "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical<br>
systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the<br>
organisms to which they are administered. This advantage can probably be explained<br>
by the ease with which said solid solutions can form liquid solutions when contacted<br>
with a liquid medium such as the gastro-intestinal juices. The ease of dissolution may<br>
be attributed at least in part to the fact that the energy required for dissolution of the<br>
components from a solid solution is less than that required for the dissolution of<br>
components from a crystalline or microcrystalline solid phase.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions, which are less homogenous<br>
throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically<br>
uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase. For example, the term "a solid<br>
dispersion" also relates to a system having domains or small regions wherein<br>
amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline compound of formula (I), or amorphous,<br>
microcrystalline or crystalline water-soluble polymer, or both, are dispersed more or<br>
less evenly in another phase comprising water-soluble polymer, or compound of<br>
formula (I), or a solid solution comprising compound of formula (I) and water-soluble<br>
polymer. Said domains are regions within the solid dispersion distinctively marked by<br>
some physical feature, small in size, and evenly and randomly distributed throughout<br>
the solid dispersion.<br>
Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion,<br>
spray-drying and solution-evaporation.<br>
The solution-evaporation process comprises the following steps :<br>
a) dissolving the compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer in an<br>
appropriate solvent, optionally at elevated temperatures;<br>
b) heating the solution resulting under point a), optionally under vacuum, until the<br>
solvent is evaporated. The solution may also be poured onto a large surface so as to<br>
form a thin film, and evaporating the solvent therefrom.<br>
In the spray-drying technique, the two components are also dissolved in an appropriate<br>
solvent and the resulting solution is then sprayed through the nozzle of a spray dryer<br>
followed by evaporating the solvent from the resulting droplets at elevated<br>
temperatures.<br>
The preferred technique for preparing solid dispersions is the melt-extrusion process<br>
comprising the following steps :<br>
a) mixing a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate water-soluble polymer,<br>
b) optionally blending additives with the thus obtained mixture,<br>
c) heating and compounding the thus obtained blend until one obtains a<br>
homogenous melt,<br>
d) forcing the thus obtained melt through one or more nozzles; and<br>
e) cooling the melt until it solidifies.<br>
The terms "melt" and "melting" should be interpreted broadly. These terras not only<br>
mean the alteration from a solid state to a liquid state, but can also refer to a transition<br>
to a glassy state or a rubbery state, and in which it is possible for one component of the<br>
mixture to get embedded more or less homogeneously into the other. In particular<br>
cases, one component will melt and the other component(s) will dissolve in the melt<br>
thus forming a solution, which upon cooling may form a solid solution having<br>
advantageous dissolution properties.<br>
After preparing the solid dispersions as described hereinabove, the obtained products<br>
can be optionally milled and sieved.<br>
The solid dispersion product may be milled or ground to particles having a particle size<br>
of less than 600 [Am, preferably less than 400 urn and most preferably less than 125 urn.<br>
The particles prepared as described hereinabove can then be formulated by<br>
conventional techniques into pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.<br>
It will be appreciated that a person of skill in the art will be able to optimize the<br>
parameters of the solid dispersion preparation techniques described above, such as the<br>
most appropriate solvent, the working temperature, the kind of apparatus being used,<br>
the rate of spray-drying, the throughput rate in the melt-extruder<br>
The water-soluble polymers in the particles are polymers that have an apparent<br>
viscosity, when dissolved at 20°C in an aqueous solution at 2 % (w/v), of 1 to 5000<br>
mPa.s more preferably of 1 to 700 mPa.s, and most preferred of 1 to 100 mPa.s. For<br>
example, suitable water-soluble polymers include alkylcelluloses, hydroxyalkylcelluloses,<br>
hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcelluloses, alkali metal salts of<br>
carboxyalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters,<br>
starches, pectines, chitin derivates, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides such as trehalose,<br>
alginic acid or alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof, carrageenans, galactomannans,<br>
tragacanth, agar-agar, gummi arabicum, guar gummi and xanthan gummi, polyacrylic<br>
acids and the salts thereof, polymethacrylic acids and the salts thereof, methacrylate<br>
copolymers, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
with vinyl acetate, combinations of polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polyalkylene oxides and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene<br>
oxide. Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses.<br>
Also one or more cyclodextrins can be used as water-soluble polymer in the preparation<br>
of the above-mentioned particles as is disclosed in WO 97/18839. Said cyclodextrins<br>
include the pharmaceutically acceptable unsubstituted and substituted cyclodextrins<br>
known in the art, more particularly a, (3 or y cyclodextrins or the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Substituted cyclodextrins which can be used to prepare the above described particles<br>
include polyethers described in U.S. Patent 3,459,731. Further substituted cyclodextrins<br>
are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is<br>
replaced by Ci-ealkyl, hydroxyCi-ealkyl, carboxy-Ci^alkyl or Ci-ealkyloxycarbonyl-<br>
Ci-ealkyl or mixed ethers thereof. In particular such substituted cyclodextrins are ethers<br>
wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by<br>
Ci-salkyl, hydroxyCj^alkyl or carboxvCualkyl or more in particular by methyl, ethyl,<br>
hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl, carboxy-methyl or carboxyethyl.<br>
Of particular utility are the (3-cyclodextrin ethers, e.g. dimethyl-(3-cyclodextrin as<br>
described in Drugs of the Future, Vol. 9, No. 8, p. 577-578 by M. Nogradi (1984) and<br>
polyethers, e.g. hydroxypropyl (3-cyclodextrin and hydroxyethyl p-cyclodextrin, being<br>
examples. Such an alkyl ether may be a methyl ether with a degree of substitution of<br>
about 0.125 to 3, e.g. about 0.3 to 2. Such a hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin may for<br>
example be formed from the reaction between |3-cyclodextrin an propylene oxide and<br>
may have a MS value of about 0.125 to 10, e.g. about 0.3 to 3.<br>
Another type of substituted cyclodextrins is sulfobutylcyclodextrines.<br>
The ratio of the compound of formula (I) over the water soluble polymer may vary<br>
widely. For example ratios of 1/100 to 100/1 may be applied Interesting ratios of the<br>
compound of formula (I) over cyclodextrin range from about 1/10 to 10/1. More<br>
interesting ratios range from about 1/5 to 5/1.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the compounds of formula (I) in the form of<br>
nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an<br>
amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm.<br>
Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the<br>
surface of the compound of formula (I) but do not chemically bond to said compound.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic<br>
pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular<br>
weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include<br>
nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the compounds of formula (I) involves a<br>
pharmaceutical composition whereby the compounds of formula (I) are incorporated in<br>
hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads,<br>
thus yielding a composition which can conveniently be manufactured and which is<br>
suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise a central, rounded or spherical core, a coating film of a<br>
hydrophilic polymer and a compound of formula (I) and optionally a seal-coating layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said<br>
materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and<br>
firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic<br>
substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical<br>
compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary<br>
dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated<br>
to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required<br>
pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including<br>
scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories,<br>
injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of HIV-infection could determine the effective daily<br>
amount from the test results presented here. In general it is contemplated that an<br>
effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more<br>
preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to<br>
administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate<br>
intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms,<br>
for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active<br>
ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound<br>
of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition<br>
being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as<br>
well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled<br>
in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or<br>
increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the<br>
evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The<br>
effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and<br>
are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
The present compounds of formula (I) can be used alone or in combination with other<br>
therapeutic agents, such as anti-virals, antibiotics, immunomodulators or vaccines for<br>
the treatment of viral infections. They may also be used alone or in combination with<br>
other prophylactic agents for the prevention of viral infections. The present compounds<br>
may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infections<br>
over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines<br>
either alone or together with other compounds of this invention or together with other<br>
anti-viral agents in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors in vaccines. Thus, the present compounds may be combined<br>
with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and<br>
administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an<br>
extended period of time against HIV infection.<br>
Also, the combination of one or more additional antiretroviral compounds and a<br>
compound of formula (I) can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also<br>
relates to a product containing (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) one or more<br>
additional antiretroviral compounds, as a combined preparation for simultaneous,<br>
separate or sequential use in anti-HTV treatment. The different drugs may be combined<br>
in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Said other<br>
antiretroviral compounds may be known antiretroviral compounds such as suramine,<br>
pentamidine, thymopentin, castanospermine, dextran (dextran sulfate), foscarnetsodium<br>
(trisodium phosphono formate); nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g.<br>
zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine;<br>
ddl), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (2'-3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine,<br>
3TC), stavudine (2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine, d4T), abacavir and the like; nonnucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine (11 -cyclopropyl-5,11 -dihydro-<br>
4-methyl-6//-dipyrido-[3,2-b: 2',3'-e][l,4]diazepin-6-one), efavirenz,<br>
delavirdine, TMC-120, TMC-125 and the like; phosphonate reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitors, e.g. tenofovir and the like; compounds of the TIBO (tetrahydroimidazo-<br>
[4,5,l-jk][l,4]-benzodiazepine-2(l.#)-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-chloro-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo-[4,5,l-jk][l,4]benzodiazepine-<br>
2(l#)-thione; compounds of the a-APA (a-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g.<br>
a-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-2,6-dichlorobenzene-acetamide and the like; inhibitors of<br>
trans-activating proteins, such as TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335, or REV inhibitors,<br>
and the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir (ABT-<br>
378), nelfinavir, amprenavir, TMC-126, BMS-232632, VX-175 and the like; fusion<br>
inhibitors, e.g. T-20, T-1249 and the like; CXCR4 receptor antagonists, e.g.<br>
AMD-3100 and the like; inhibitors of the viral integrase; nucleotide-like reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. tenofovir and the like; ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors,<br>
e.g. hydroxyurea and the like.<br>
By administering the compounds of the present invention with other anti-viral agents<br>
which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these<br>
compounds can be potentiated. Combination therapies as described above exert a<br>
synergistic effect in inhibiting HTV replication because each component of the<br>
combination acts on a different site of HTV replication. The use of such combinations<br>
may reduce the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent which would be<br>
required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent<br>
is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the<br>
side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral therapy while not interfering with the<br>
anti-viral activity of the agents. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to<br>
single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations<br>
-28-<br>
may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the<br>
associated toxicity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with<br>
immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon<br>
antibody, interferon alpha, interleukin 2, methionine enkephalin, diethyldithiocarbamate,<br>
tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and the like; antibiotics, e.g. pentamidine<br>
isethiorate and the like; cholinergic agents, e.g. tacrine, rivastigmine, donepezil,<br>
galantamine and the like; NMDA channel blockers, e.g. memantine to prevent or<br>
combat infection and diseases or symptoms of diseases associated with HTV infections,<br>
such as ADDS and ARC, e.g. dementia. A compound of formula (I) can also be<br>
combined with another compound of formula (I).<br>
Although the present invention focuses on the use of the present compounds for<br>
preventing or treating HJV infections, the present compounds may also be used as<br>
inhibitory agents for other viruses which depend on similar reverse transcriptases for<br>
obligatory events in their life cycle.<br>

and 30 ml of concentrated color suspension and the whole is homogenized.<br>
The tablet cores are coated with the thus obtained mixture in a coating apparatus.<br>
Antiviral spectrum:<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HTV strains, the present<br>
compounds were tested for their potency against clinically isolated HTV strains<br>
harboring several mutations. These mutations are associated with resistance to reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of phenotypic<br>
cross-resistance to the currently commercially available drugs such as for instance AZT<br>
and delavirdine.<br>
The antiviral activity of the compound of the present invention has been evaluated in<br>
the presence of wild type HIV and HIV mutants bearing mutations at the reverse<br>
transcriptase gene. The activity of the compounds is evaluated using a cellular assay<br>
and the residual activity is expressed in pECso values. The columns IIIB and A-G in the<br>
table list the pECso values against various strains IIIB, A- G.<br>
