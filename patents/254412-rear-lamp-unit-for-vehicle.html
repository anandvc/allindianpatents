				<td>The present invention relates to a rear lamp unit for a vehicle<br>
[Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a rear lamp unit for a vehicle such as a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002J<br>
A rear lamp unit for a vehicle such as a motorcycle includes a tail lamp to be illuminated for notifying the presence of the vehicle to the rear, and a brake lamp to be illuminated for notifying that the vehicle is in braking action, and so on.  In these rear lamp units, a plurality of light-emitting diodes (so-called LED) are used as a light source (for example, see Patent Document 1).  In such a rear lamp unit, since flexibility in design of the rear lamp unit itself and the rear portion of the vehicle body such that the shape of the lens which is large in aspect ratio of can be set easily, it is employed in many of vehicles in recent years.<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A-2003-54460 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
Since illumination of the light-emitting diode has high directivity, there is a case where an outer lens disposed in the illuminating direction thereof is formed with a predetermined cut pattern to diffuse light, hence widening the light-emitting area.<br>
However, the cut pattern formed on the outer lens is located close to the outer surface of the vehicle, it can be seen easily from the outside, and hence the pattern may affect the appearance of the vehicle. Therefore, a rear lamp unit which can be provided with the cut pattern in relation to the appearance of the vehicle and can secure a predetermined light-emitting area has been awaited.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a rear lamp unit for a vehicle which can be provided with a desired cut pattern on the outer lens and,  simultaneously,  can increase the light-emitting area. [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0004]<br>
As means for solving the problems described above, the invention according to Claim 1 is a rear lamp unit (for example, a rear lamp unit 50 in an embodiment) for a vehicle including an outer lens (for example, upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b in the embodiment) for guiding light emitted from a light-emitting diode (for example a light-emitting diode 55 in the embodiment) to the outside of the vehicle, characterized in that an inner lens (for example, upper and lower inner lenses 71a,  71b in the embodiment)  is provided between the<br>
aforementioned light-emitting diode and the outer lens, and the inner lens is provided at a location apart from the aforementioned outer lens.<br>
[0005]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is a rear lamp unit (for example, the rear lamp unit 50 according to the embodiment) for a vehicle which is illuminated by light emitted from the light-emitting diode (for example, the light-emitting diode 55 in the embodiment), characterized in that the inner lens (for example the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b in the embodiment) and the outer lens (for example, the upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b in the embodiment) are disposed in the direction of illumination of the aforementioned light-emitting diode.<br>
[0006]<br>
In this arrangement, light (illumination) emitted from the light-emitting diode is passed through the inner lens and then guided to the outside of the vehicle via the outer lens. In this case, illumination from the light-emitting diode is bent and diffused by the cut pattern on the inner lens and then bent and diffused by the cut pattern on the outer lens. Therefore, even when the cut pattern on the outer lens is aligned in substantially one direction in relation to the appearance of the vehicle, illumination from the light-emitting diode can be diffused over a wide range evenly as long<br>
as the cut pattern which can compensate light distribution generated by the cut pattern on the outer lens is formed on the inner lens, and consequently the light-emitting area of the rear light unit itself may be widened. In addition, when the inner lens is disposed at a location apart from the outer lens, the inner lens can hardly be seen from the outside.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the aforementioned outer lens is formed with a lens extending in substantially one direction (for example, a flute cut lens 73 in the embodiment) and the aforementioned inner lens is formed with a lens extending in the direction substantially orthogonal to the lens of the aforementioned outer lens (for example, a perpendicular flute cut lens 75 in the embodiment).<br>
[0008]<br>
As an example, as in the invention according to Claim 4, a unit in which the lens of the aforementioned outer lens extends substantially in the horizontal direction, and the lens of the aforementioned inner lens extends substantially in the perpendicular direction is also conceivable.<br>
[0009]<br>
In this arrangement, illumination from the light-emitting diode is bent and diffused by the lens of the inner lens, for example, substantially in the horizontal direction,<br>
and then bent and diffused by the lens of the outer lens substantially in the vertical direction. Therefore, illumination from the light-emitting diode can be diffused over a wide range without being biased, and as in the invention stated in Claims 1, 2, the outer lens can be provided with a desired cut pattern in relation to the appearance of the vehicle and, simultaneously, can increase the light-emitting area of the rear lamp unit itself.<br>
[0010]<br>
The invention according to Claim 5 is characterized in that a plurality of the aforementioned light-emitting diodes are arranged substantially in the horizontal direction, and the aforementioned inner lens is provided between the light-emitting diodes disposed at least on both outer sides out of the plurality of light-emitting diodes and the outer lens.<br>
[0011]<br>
In this arrangement, the light-emitting area at least at the both side portions of the outer lens can be increased, and especially, even when the outer lens is formed into a bent shape according to the shape of the vehicle body, light emission of the rear lamp unit itself can easily be recognized when viewing the vehicle from obliquely behind. Also, in comparison with the case in which the inner lens is provided between all the light-emitting diodes and the outer lens.<br>
downsizing of the inner lens or reduction of the number of components is achieved.<br>
[0012]<br>
The invention according to Claim 6 is characterized in that the aforementioned outer lens is a colored transparent member, and the inner lens is a colorless transparent member, and in that the aforementioned inner lens is disposed in the vicinity of the aforementioned light-emitting diodes.<br>
[0013]<br>
In this arrangement, in comparison with the case in which the outer lens is a colorless transparent member, the inner lens can hardly be seen from the outside. Also, since the inner lens is a colorless transparent member, lowering of the amount of light illuminated from the light-emitting diodes is prevented. In addition, since the inner lens is disposed in the vicinity of the light-emitting diode, it is disposed at a location apart from the outer lens, and the inner lens can further hardly be seen from the outside. [Advantages]<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the invention as stated in Claims 1 to 4, since the inner lens is provided between the light-emitting diode and the outer lens, the outer lens may be formed with a cut pattern which is suitable to the appearance of the vehicle and simultaneously the light-emitting area of the rear lamp<br>
unit itself may be increased, whereby visibility of the tail lamp, the brake lamp, and so on may be improved and flexibility in modeling of the rear lamp unit itself and design of the vehicle body therearound may be improved.<br>
[0015]<br>
Also, as in the invention stated in Claims 1 and 6, since the inner lens is provided at a location apart from the outer lens, the inner lens can hardly be seen from the outside, and hence good appearance of the vehicle can be maintained.<br>
[0016]<br>
Furthermore, as in the invention according to claim 6, when the outer lens is a colored transparent member, the inner lens can hardly be seen from the outside, and the good appearance of the vehicle can be maintained, and when the inner lens is a colorless transparent member, lowering of the light amount illuminated from the light-emitting diode is prevented to maintain a good visibility of the tail lamp, the brake lamp, and so on.<br>
[0017]<br>
According to the invention as stated in Claim 5, since the inner lens is provided between the light-emitting diode located at least on both outer sides out of the plurality of light-emitting diodes and the outer lens, light emission from the rear lamp unit itself can easily be recognized even when viewing the vehicle from obliquely behind.   Also,  by<br>
downsizing the inner lens or reducing the number of components, weight reduction and cost reduction of the rear lamp unit itself are achieved. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>

As shown in Fig. 7, the inner lens cover 71 includes an upper inner lens (inner lens) 71a and a lower inner lens (inner lens) 71b positioned forwardly of the light-emitting diodes 55 of the respective chambers 64 of the upper and lower levels formed and connected integrally with each other via a relay portion 72, and is formed substantially into a staircase pattern along the lamp base 52 with a clearance interposed therebetween as needed. The upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b are provided between the light-emitting diodes 55 and the upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b at the position in the vicinity of the light-emitting diodes 55 in the respective chambers 64 and apart from the upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b. The inner lens cover 71 is attached to the extension 63 from the front (from the side of the lamp base 52) and fixed with screws or the like. Here, the inner lens cover 71 is a member including the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b formed of colorless transparent material such as acryl or the like and formed integrally therewith.<br>
[0034]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b are formed substantially into a rectangular shape almost overlapped with the both sides of the upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b when viewed from the rear of the vehicle body. Then, illumination from the respective light-emitting diodes 55 positioned on both outer sides of the upper and lower levels pass through the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b, then through the both ends of the outer lenses 51a, 51b, and then emitted to the outside from the lamp chamber 54.<br>
[0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, a cut pattern for forming flute  cut  lenses  (lenses)  73  is  provided  extending substantially in the horizontal direction between the both side edges on the front face side (the side of the light-emitting diode 55) of the upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b.  The flute cut lenses 73 form a plurality of triangles substantially in cross section projecting toward the lamp chamber 54, and these flute cut lenses are formed to be vertically symmetry on the respective upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b. Ridge lines 74 of the flute cut lenses 73 are formed substantially into a shallow V-shape in the vertical direction corresponding to the upper and lower outer lenses 51a, 51b when viewed from the rear of the vehicle body. In other words, the ridge lines 74 of the flute cut lenses 73 extend substantially in the horizontal direction. The flute cut lenses 73 contribute to<br>
diffuse light from the light-emitting diodes 55 substantially in the vertical direction.<br>
[0036]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, cut patterns forming vertical flute cut lenses 75 are provided on the rear face side of the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b (on the side of the outer lenses 51a, 51b) so as to extend substantially in the vertical direction between the upper edges and the lower edges thereof. More specifically, the vertical flute cut lenses 75 are formed so as to extend, when viewed from the rear of the vehicle body, in the direction substantially orthogonal to the ridges 74 of the flute cut lenses 73 formed on the portion of the outer lenses 51a, 51b superimposed with the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b when viewed from the rear of the vehicle body.  The illumination from the light-emitting diodes 55 is diffused substantially in the lateral direction by the vertical flute cut lenses 75. A spiral cut pattern about the optical axis L is provided on the front face sides (the side of the light-emitting diode 55) of the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b for diffusing illumination from the light-emitting diodes 55 as needed.<br>
[0037]<br>
According to the aforementioned embodiment, in the rear lamp unit 50 having functions as a tail lamp and a brake lamp of the motorcycle 1 and illuminating by illumination from the<br>
plurality of light-emitting diodes 55, since the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b are provided between the light-emitting diodes 55 located at both outer sides and the both sides of the respective outer lenses 51a, 51b respectively, illumination from the light-emitting diodes 55 at both outer sides passes through the corresponding upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b, then passes through the outer lenses 51a, 51b, and then is emitted outside. In this case, illumination from the light-emitting diode 55 is diffused substantially in the lateral direction by the lens cut pattern of the upper and lower inner lenses 71a, 71b and substantially in the vertical direction by the lens cut pattern of the outer lenses 51a, 51b.<br>
[0038]<br>
Since the ridges 74 of the flute cut lenses 73 formed on the outer lenses 51a, 51b can be seen from the outside the outer lens cover 51, the cut pattern of the outer lenses 51a, 51b extending substantially in the horizontal direction is employed in relation to the appearance of the motorcycle 1. However, in such a case as well, light from the light-emitting diode 55 having high directivity can be diffused in the vertical and lateral directions to increase the light-emitting areas at the both side portions of the outer lenses 51a, 51b. Therefore, light emission from the rear lamp unit 50 itself can be recognized easily when viewed obliquely from the rear of the motorcycle 1, and hence visibility of the rail lamp and<br>
the brake lamp may be improved and flexibility in modeling of the rear lamp unit 50 itself and design of the vehicle body therearound may be improved.<br>
[0039]<br>
Also, since the inner lenses 71a, 71b are provided in the vicinity of the light-emitting diodes 55 at locations apart from the outer lenses 51a, 51b, the inner lenses 71a, 71b can hardly be seen from the outside, whereby good appearance of the vehicle can be maintained.<br>
In addition, since the outer lenses 51a, 51b are red transparent, the inner lenses 71a, 71b can hardly be seen from the outside in comparison with the case in which they are colorless transparent, whereby the good appearance of the vehicle is maintained. Furthermore, when the inner lenses 71a, 71b are colorless transparent members, lowering of the amount of illumination from the light-emitting diode 55 may be prevented in comparison with the case in which they are colored transparent, whereby visibility of the tail lamp, the brake lamp, and so on can be maintained preferably.<br>
[0040]<br>
In particular, even when the light-emitting surfaces of the outer lenses 51a, 51b are curved so as to be flush with the outer surface of the outer peripheral wall 41 of the rear fender 40, light emission from the rear lamp unit 50 itself can easily be recognized when viewing the motorcycle 1<br>
obliquely from the rear thereof. Also, in comparison with the case in which the inner lens is provided between all the light-emitting diodes 55 and the outer lenses 51a, 51b, the size of the inner lens and the number of component may be reduced, whereby the weight reduction and cost reduction of the rear lamp unit 50 itself is achieved.<br>
[0041]<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and as a rear lamp unit 150 shown in Fig. 8, for example, the structure in which an inner lens cover 171 is mounted so as to cover all the light-emitting diodes 55 arranged in the lamp chamber 54 from the illuminating direction (from the rear of the vehicle), so that an inner lens 171a is provided between all the light-emitting diodes 55 and the outer lenses 51a, 51b may be employed.  Lenses formed on the outer lenses 51a, 51b and the inner lenses 71a, 71bmay be cylindrical lenses. Further, for example, the cut pattern extending substantially in the vertical direction may be employed for the outer lenses 51a, 51b, and the cut pattern extending substantially in the horizontal direction may be employed for the inner lenses 71a, 71b. Furthermore, the rear lamp unit having a structure in which the light-emitting diodes 55 may be differentiated for the tail lamp and for the brake lamp, or the structure in which the rear winkers 37 or the back lamp are included may also be applicable. The structure of the aforementioned embodiment<br>
is only an example, and modifications may be made as needed without departing the scope of the invention as a matter of course.<br>
