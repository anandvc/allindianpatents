J	I<br>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PRIORITY ACCESS CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT IN A CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to cellular telephone systems in genera.' and, more particularly, to a system and method for priority access channel assignment in a cellular telephone system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cellular telephone technology has evolved from relatively simple voice communication with limited geographical areas of coverage- to sophisticated communication technology for voice communication, voice messaging, and data messaging virtually anywhere in the world. The number of mobile stations (i.e., users) has grown significantly in recent years. For example, in the United States, a large percentage of the population owns a cellular telephone. In other countries where there is no existing telephone system, cellular<br>
telephones are used in plac6 of conventional telephone syjstems thus<br>
eliminating the need for physical wires from central switching offices to<br>
individual users,	*	- *:   -	!<br>
The implementation of complex communication systems, such as described above, require communication standards and protocol^ that allow different organizations and manufacturers to maintain compatibility of the overall system. For example, many standards for cellular telephone communication have been established by the Telecommunicatiolns Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronic Industries Association (E1A). j There are a number of TIA/EIA standards for cellular telephone communication. One such standard is TIA/EIA/2S-95-B, entitled "Mobile Station-B^se Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wide Band Spread Spectijum Cellular System." This standard, which may be referred to as IS-95-Bl defines the communication protocol between mobile station and base station. The utilization of such a standard allows different manufacturers to construct equipment having different design features and implementations, but which will still function satisfactorily if it meets the standards set forth in IS-95-B.<br>
Other features have been defined by TIA/EIA, but have r.o standards regarding implementation or protocol.   For example, priority access channel<br><br>
assignment is a feature that allows a cellular system to prioritize incoming calls from mobile stations into assigned channels to the mobile stations based on these priorities. However, no protocol or standard exists to implement such a feature. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that there is a significant need for a communication protocol and standard that will allow priority access channel assignment. The present invention provides these and other features as will be apparent from the following figures and accompanying detailed description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
i<br>
The present invention is embodied in a system and method for<br>
communication protocol for priority access channel assignment in a cellular<br>
i<br>
telephone system. The protocol includes a first origination message transmitted from a first of the plurality of mobile stations to a first base station tor a first call request from the first mobile station. The first origination messagej includes data indicative of a priority access channel assignment (PACA) request and a PACA origination element indicating that the first call request its initiated by the first mobile station. A service request message is transmitted from the first base station to a mobile switching center and includes PACA request data based on the PACA origination element transmitted in the first origination message. A PACA command message from the mobile -switching.center-to the iirst base station indicates PACA authorization and a priority level associated with the first call request. A first PACA message is sent from the first base station to the first mobile station indicating that the first call request has been granted and placed in a queue associated with the first base station. The first PACA message also indicates the position of the first call request vyithin the queue.<br>
Additional protocol elements include a second PACA message to the first mobile station at a subsequent time when resources are available to process the first call request, The second PACA message contains data indicating that the first ijnobile station should reoriginate the first call request. In response to the secohd PACA message, the first mobile station transmits a second originatipn message including the PACA re-origination element set to a value indicating the re-origination of the first call request.<br>
The protocol also includes various optional acknowledgment and confirmation messages that may be transmitted between the mobile station, the base statibn, and the mobile switching center. The first base station queue may contain a plurality of messages, each having an assigned priority level. The<br><br>
system, such as defined in 1S-95-B. However, the invention is not limited to a<br>
specific wireless technology or communication standard,	.<br>
The PACA communication system and protocol described herein can be<br>
implemented within the confines of existing cellular telephone standards (e.g.,<br>
IS-95-B).   Furthermore, the system and protocol of the present invention<br>
satisfies the PACA features required by industry standard TIA/EIA-664,<br>
entitled Cellular Features Description,  For a more complete understanding of<br>
the PACA system and protocol, a brief description of a conventional cellular<br>
telephone system will be provided-  FIG. 1 illustrates the element^ of a basic<br>
cellular telephone system.  A geographic area is served by one oij more base<br>
stations, each of which controls multiple areas of communication coverage<br>
known as cells. FIG. 1 illustrates two base station controllers, which may also<br>
be referred to simply as base stations BS1 and BS2. Each base station controls<br>
one or more cells*   A typical base station controls a large number of cells.<br>
However, for the sake of clarity, FIG, 1 illustrates only cells C1-C4. Each cell<br>
C1-C4 communicates with the base station via a base station transceiver system<br>
BTS. FIG. 1 illustrates base station transceiver systems BTS1-BTS4, which relay<br>
communications between the base stations and cells C1-C4, respectively. The<br>
base station transceiver systems BTS1-BTS3 are illustrated in FIG. 1 |as portions<br>
of a common serving system, and are all controlled by the base station BS1. The<br>
individual base station transceiver systems BTS1-BTS3 are coupled ;to the base<br>
station BS1 by communication links, such as a wireless communication link,<br>
hard wired communication lirik, or the like. * In contrast, the base station<br>
transceiver system BTS4 is controlled by the base station BS2. The bpse stations<br>
BSl and BS2 are each coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC). [The mobile<br>
switching center MSC may connect a call from a mobile station to a<br>
conventional telephone system, such as a public switched telephone network<br>
(PSTN).	!<br>
Within each cell are a variable number of mobile stations. For the sake of clarity, FIG. 1 illustrates only a few mobile stations. Mobile stations MS1-MS3 are illustrated in cell CI, mobile stations MS4-MS5 are illustrated; in cell C2, mobile stations MS6-MS8 are illustrated in cell C3 and mobile stations MS9-MSIO are illustrated in cell C4. It should be understood that a typijcal cell will contain many more users than illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
As those skilled in the art can appreciate, the mobile stations may move from one cell to another during a single communication session. As the mobile station moves from one cell to another (e.g., MS3 moves from cell Gl to cell C4), the old base station performs a handoff of the mobile station to thfe new base<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the successful completion of a cellular telephone call, the cellular telephone system must have sufficient resources available to process the call request, j For example, a call originated by a mobile station requires that a channel be available to assign to that subscriber.   During periods of peak communication traffic, a large number of users may utilize all available resources.   Under these circumstances, a mobile station may find that the cellular telephone system cannot process a call. The user is forced to try again at a later time when traffic volume has diminished. . ^        Howeyer, the present invention allows prioritization of phone"calls ancl assigns channels based on the assigned priorities.   For example, emergency calls (e.g., 911, police, fire, and the like) may be automatically assigned a high priority level such that the mobile station calling the emergency number receives a channel assignment prior to a non-emergency mobile station even though the non-emergency mobile station may have been waiting for a longer period of time for a channel assignment.   Other subscribers may pay a premium; for high priority access to the cellular system.  Such a prioritization scheme requires a communication protocol that allows the exchange of data between the mobile station and the cellular telephone service provider.   The present invention is directed to a systent and method for priority access channel assignment (PACA) in a cellular telephone or other wireless communication system.  Although the specific embodiment described herein uses a cellular telephone system as an example, those skilled in the art will recognize that the inventive concepts are applicable to any wireless communication system, including, but not limited to TDMA, PCS, CDMA, and the like.  The protocol defined herein is described with respect to a spread spectrum cellular telephone<br><br>
base station processes the pending calls in the queue based on priority with a<br>
higher priority pending call request being processed prior to a lower priority<br>
pending call request. In addition, the time of arrival of the call request is used<br>
to determine the position within the queue. For calls having identical priority<br>
levels, the base station processes calls that have the earliest time of arrival prior<br>
to processing calls having a later time of arrival.	i<br>
If the mobile station moves from a first cell to a second cell and is now communicating with a second base station, the mobile switching center transmits a PACA query message to the first base station to request priority information from the first base station. The first base station transmits a PACA query acknowledgment in response to the PACA query message. The PACA query acknowledgment contains the requested priority information. Upon receiving the priority information from the first base station, }he mobile switching center transmits a PACA command message to the second base station indicating PACA authorization and a priority level associated with the first call request. The second base station transmits a PACA message to the first mobile station indicating that the call request has been granted and placed in a queue associated with the second base station based on the priority level associated with the first call request,<br>

station. In the example illustrated above, the base station BS1 performs a handoff of the mobile station MS3 to the base station BS2. As a result, mobile stations |may freely travel in a geographic area while maintaining a communication link that, from the subscriber's perspective, is continuous and seamless.! The handoff is referred to as an "idle" handoff if the mobile station is not actively engaged in an ongoing telephone call (e.g., the mobile station is turned on, but is awaiting a call), The handoff is referred to as a "traffic channel"; liandoff if the mobile station is actively engaged in an ongoing telephone call. The handoff process is well known in the art, and need not be described herein. The PACA communication protocol for idle handoffs will be described in detail below.<br>
In'operation, a call originated by a mobile station is coupled to the mobile switching center via the base station controlling the cell in which the mobile station is located. For example, a call originated by the mobile station MSI is processed by the base station BSl. The base station BSl communicates with the mobile switching center MSC The above description assumes that resources are available to assign a channel to mobile station MSI* In a conventional system, if resources are not available at the time mobile station MSI origpates the call, the base station BSl will refuse the call, and the mobile station MJS1 user has no choice but to hang up and try again later.<br>
The PACA system and protocol of the present invention allows a mobile station to obtain priority access to a communications channel by gueuing call ■ origination requests when channels are not currently available. The system provides for multiple priority levels and prioritizes calls based on the priority level such that higher priority call requests are queued ahead of lower priority requests.  Thus, a higher priority call may be queued ahead of a lower priority call, even though the lower priority call has been in the queue longer. Call requests having the same priority are queued in the order of time of arrival.<br>
The system provides the user with an indication of their queue position (e.g., 8th in line) and alerts the mobile station when a channel is available. In addition,!the PACA system and protocol of the present invention allows the subscribejr to roam to another cell with a pending PACA request. If the new cell in which the subscriber is located has an available channel, the call request will be serviced immediately. IH the subscriber roams to a cell in the current serving system in which resources are not presently available, the PACA request i^ transferred in a manner that preserves the subscriber's place in the queue. Finally, the PACA system and protocol of the present invention cancels<br><br>
PACA requests under certain conditions. The protocol for each of these above-described features will be described in greater detail herein.<br>
The PACA system and protocol utilizes a number of priority levels. In. an exemplary embodiment, 16 priority levels are supported by the present<br>
system.  The system further supports permanent priority assignments, which<br>
i<br>
are obtained by the subscriber when initially subscribing to cellular service. A<br>
i<br>
subscriber may receive a default PACA priority level and a maximum PACA priority level. Such permanent PACA priority levels are always available and automatically requested at call origination. The mobile station automatically requests the default PACA priority level and permits the user to alter the requested priority level up to the preassigned maximum PACA priority level.<br>
The system also supports "demand" PACA requests, which may be manually requested by the user by prepending a predetermined PACA feature code to the call Origination request. With the demand PACA request, the user also has a preassigned default PACA priority level and a preassigned maximum PACA priority level. The predetermined PACA feature code will initially request the preassigned default PACA priority level, but may be altered to change the PACA priority level request up to the preassigned maximum PACA priority level.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a call flow diagram for call origination from a mobile station in which a PACA priority level is assigned and the call is successfully completed when a channel becomes available. As ca&amp; be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a number of communication messages may be transmitted between the mobile station (MS) and the base station (BS) as well as communication messages between the base station and the mobilej switching center (MSC). These communications are transparent to the user, but are required by the PACA protocol of the present invention to properly establish a PACA request and to enter the call into the appropriate position in queue. The protocol specifies a series of messages that occur in a time sequence illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 4-9 by a series of lowercase letters. Each action occurring at a particular time may also be thought of as a step in the message processing.<br>
At time a, the mobile station MS initiates a call request by transmitting an Origination Message, The Origination Message is transmitted over the access channel of the air interface to the base station to request priority service. The Origination Message includes a one bit data field, designated as PACA.REOR1G. The PACA^REORIG data field is initially set to a v?iue of "0" to indicate a user directed call origination. As discussed above, the user is assigned a default priority level, but may send a feature code with the<br><br>
origination request to demand a different priority level up to the maximum priority level assigned to the user when signing up for service with the service<br>
provider.<br>
Under existing communication protocol, an Origination Message requires a "layer 2" acknowledgment. At time b in FIG. 2, the base station BS acknowledges receipt of the Origination Message by transmitting a Base Station Acknowledgment Order to the mobile station MS. This message simply acknowledges receipt of the Origination Message.<br>
At time c, the base station BS constructs a configuration management<br>
i<br>
(CM) Service Request message for transmission to the mobile switching center<br>
MSC The CM Service Request message is a portion of a message defined by<br>
i<br>
current industry standards as a "complete layer 3" information message, which is transmitted from the base station BS to the mobile switching center MSC. Various elements of the CM Service Request message are defined by industry standard IS-634-A Section 6.1.2.2. An example of the data structure used for the CM Service Request message is shown below in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
a.	Present when an authentication enabled base station BS does not receive the<br>
authentication parameters (AUTHR, RANDC and COUNT) from the mobile<br>
station MS.<br>
b.	Present when the mobile station MS makes a priority service request.<br>
It should be noted that the tables presented herein describe the direction of flow for each of the data elements as well as an indication that each information elements is mandatory (AA) or optional (O), The tablep also refer to relevant sections of standards that provide additional details regarding each information element.<br>
The CM Service Request message includes a PACA re-origination indicator element, which is not defined by existing standards. The reference section in Table 1 for the PACA Reorigination Indicator refers to a proposed standard based on the present invention. The PACA re-origination indicator field is set to the same value as the one bit data field PACAJIEORIG received in the Origination Message from the mobile station MS. At the time the CM<br><br>
Service Request message is transmitted, the base station BS starts a timer, designated as T303. The timer T303 is an optional time out timer. If appropriate responses are not received from the mobile switching center MSC within alprescribed time period, the base station.BS may retransmit the CM<br>
Service Request message.<br>
The CM Service Request message includes call origination data {e.g., the electronic serial number (ESN) and /or mobile identification number (MIN) of the mobile station as well as the dialed digits. During analysis of the dialed digits, the mobile switching center MSC detects a PACA call request. In response to this detection, the mobile switching center MSC sends the PACA request, dall origination data and dialed digits to the network for authorization. If the authorization is successful, the call origination is allowed to proceed. If the authorization is unsuccessful, the PACA request is denied and the call is terminated.<br>
In! a conventional cellular telephone system, the base station BS determines whether resources are currently available to provide a channel assignment to the mobile station. The availability (or lack of availability) of resources is transmitted from the base station BS to the mobile switching center<br>
i<br>
MSC as part of the CM Service Request message.   If resources are currently available: to provide a channel assignment to the mobile station, the call is processed in a conventional manner.   However, if resources are presently unavailable to process the call, the mobile switching center MSC .sends a PACA -Command message to the base station BS at time d to inform the base station that PACA was successfully activated for the call.   The PACA Command message specifies PACA information, including the priority level assigned to the user, and the PACA permanent activation status. As previously discussed, the subscriber may obtain a permanent priority assignment when initially subscribing to the wireless service. The subscriber may receive a default PACA priority }evel and a maximum PACA priority level.   If the subscriber has selected permanent PACA activation, data related to the default PACA priority level anc{ the maximum PACA priority level are stored within the mobile station in a home location register (HLR). A sample data structure used'for the PACA command is shown below in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
In addition, the mobile switching center MSC may initiate an optional timer, designated as Tpacal, at the time the PACA command message is sent to the base station B$. .The tijjier Tpacal measures a time out period and is stopped when an optional acknowledgment is received from the base station BS. If the timer Tpacal times out prior to receiving a response from the base station BS, the mobile switching center MSC may retransmit the PACA Command message. If the optional acknowledgment message from the base station BS is omitted, the timer Tpacal is unnecessary.<br>
A portion of the PACA Command message includes PACA information, such as the PACA priority level assigned to the mobile station and the PACA permanent activation status, a PACA time delta, which indicates the present time minus the time at which the origination request entered the PACA queue at the base station (in 100 millisecond units), and a PACA queue position, which indicates the position of the mobile station MS within the PACA queue. Each of these information data fields is contained within the PACA Command illustrated, by way of example, in Table 2. Tables 3-5 below provide further details of these information data fields. The PACA information data field, illustrated in Table 3, includes a plurality of eight bit data bytes, including an element identifier data field, a length data field indicating the number of bytes<br><br><br><br>
At time e, the base station BS sends an optional PACA Complete message to the mobile switching center MSC in response to!the PACA Command message. The PACA Complete message provides confirmation that the PACA data was received. However, communication links between the base station BS and the mobile switching center MSC are generally highly reliable. Therefore, the PACA Complete message is optional and may be eliminated. If the optional PACA Complete message is not used, it is unnecessary to implement the timers T303 and Tpacal. Upon receipt of the PACA Complete message, the mobile switching center MSC stops the timer Tpacal. The information elements of the PACA Complete message are illustrated below in Table 6.<br><br>
Based* on information received in the PACA.Command message, the base station BS will queue the call request and send an air interface PACA Message to the mobile station MS. The PACA Message is predefined by existing standards, and includes a PURPOSE data field to provide status and/or data to the mobile station MS. The standard IS-95-B provides a four bit binary data field to define different PACA message purposes, as illustrated in Table 7 below.<br><br><br>
It<br>
At time f in FIG. 2, the base station BS sets the PURPOSE data field in the PACA message to a value of "0000" to inform the mobile station that the priority request has been queued as a PACA call and to indicate the queue position.; For example, the user may be third in line for a channel assignment. The PACA message indicates the queue position to the mobile station MS so that the user may determine whether to wait or terminate the call.<br>
The PACA system and protocol of the present invention also allows an optional PACA.message with the PURPOSE data field set*toRvalue of "0001" • to be transmitted to the mobile station MS over the paging channel to periodically update the PACA queue position, as shown at time g in FIG. 2. The base; station BS may resend this message periodically until a voice/traffic channel becomes available. However, this PACA message is optional.<br>
At time h, a traffic channel becomes available. At this time, the base station BS sends an additional PACA message over the air interface to instruct the mobije station MS to re-originate the PACA call. In this case, the PURPOSE data field is set to a value of "0010" to indicate the PACA call re-origination.<br>
At time i, the mobile station MS sends a new Origination Message to the base station BS to request service. The mobile* station MS automatically transmits the new Origination Message without any manual intervention required by the user. As previously discussed, the Origination Message is sent with a layer 2 acknowledgment required. Unlike the Origination Message sent at time aj the mobile station MS sets the one bit data field PACA_REORIG to a value of j'l" in'the Origination Message sent at time i to indicate that the base station BS directed PACA re-origination rather than a user directed origination.<br><br>
At time j, the base station BS acknowledges the Origination Message with a Base Station Acknowledgment Order to the mobile station MS. At this point, the mobile station MS and the base station BS follow the normal mobile origination procedure as specified in IS-95-B, section 2.2-2.1, Thus, the PACA system and protocol of the present invention provides messaging between the mobile station MS, the base station BS, and the mobile switching center MSC.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the queue itself is maintained within each base station BS. As previously described, the position in the queue is based on the priority assigned to the user and the time at which the Origination Message was transmitted from the mobile station MS to the base station BS. As discussed above, the priority for the particular call is transmitted from the mobile switching center MSC to the base station BS in the PACA command, illustrated in FIG. 2 at time d. Based on the priority and the time of arrival of the Origination Message, the base station BS places the call in a position in the queue.<br>
The base station BS may utilize a number of known system architectures to implement the queue. A number of known data structures exist to support the operation of the queue. For example, the base station BS may include a separate data structure and maintain separate queues for each priority level. This is illustrated in FIG. 3A where PACA requests may be maintained in sequence for each of n priority levels. That is, the level 1 priority requests are maintained in sequence within a data structure specifically designated for level 1. priority calls. Similarly, data structure 2 maintains a sequential list of level 2 priority calls, and so forth.<br>
Alternatively, a single data structure may be used to store the data for each call and a pointer or series of pointers used to indicate the head of the queue for each priority level. This is illustrated in FIG. 3B wThere a single queue contains all pending PACA requests. The PACA requests for each priority level are sequentially stored with a pointer indicating the top of the queue for each priority level.<br>
In yet another alternative embodiment, the base station BS may include a single data structure with a data field indicating the position within the queue. This is illustrated in FIG. 3C where PACA requests are stored in a queue in the order in which they are received, regardless of their position in the queue. A data field, indicated in FIG. 3C as a queue position, stores a number indicative of the position of a pending PACA request within the queue,   Other known<br>
forms of data structures may also be satisfactorily used to implement the<br>
i<br>
queue.   It should be clear that the present invention is not limited by the<br><br>
specific form of data structure or system architecture used to implement the<br>
queue.<br>
A? can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, users are generally unwilling to wait in a queue beyond a certain length of time. Accordingly, maintaining a queue size beyond that which is likely to receive a channel assignment in a few minutes is impractical. A practical implementation of the PACA system and protocol has a maximum queue size. Within the queue, the system attempts to accommodate the highest priority requests. During periods of high Call traffic volume the queue may be completely full Under these conditions, if a call arrives with a higher priority than some calls already in the queue, the system will place the higher priority call in an appropriate position within the queue and drop the lowest priority call from the queue. Dropping a low priority call from the queue results in a PACA Cancel message, which will be described in greater detail .below. It should be noted that the system will only terminate lower priority calls at the queuing stage. Once a channel has been assigned and a communication link established, it will not be interrupted to service a higher priority PACA call request.<br>
In! summary, the mobile station MS transmits an origination message,<br>
which is acknowledged by the base station BS. The base station BS determines<br>
whether resources are available to process the call request from the mobile<br>
station MS and transmits a CM Service Request message to the mobile<br>
switching center MSC The CM Service Request message includes a data field<br>
(see Table 1) that indicates whether or not resources are available.  The MSC<br>
mobile switching center processes the CM Service Request message.   If the<br>
PACA_REORIG data field has a value of "0," the mobile switching center MSC<br>
knows tiiat the PACA call origination came from the mobile station and is a<br>
new call.! If the resources are available, the call is processed in the conventional<br>
manner. 1 If the resources are not available, the mobile switching center MSC<br>
determines whether the subscriber is an authorized user and is authorized to<br>
make PACA requests. In addition, the mobile switching center MSC analyzes<br>
the dialed digits and determines the priority based on the dialed digits.  As<br>
previously discussed, certain dialed digits, such as emergency numbers, receive<br>
a high priority, while calls to most destination telephone numbers receive the<br>
priority level assigned to the subscriber (the default priority level or the<br>
requested priority level up to the assigned maximum priority level).   The<br>
mobile switching center MSC determines the priority and sends the priority<br>
data  to jthe base station BS in  a PACA Command message,  which is<br>
acknowledge by a PACA Complete message. The base station BS sends one or<br><br>
more PACA Messages to the mobile station MS. When resources become available, the mobile station MS is instructed to re-originate tHe call and resources are assigned to the mobile station in a conventional manner. Thus, the PACA system and protocol of the present invention provides! a reliable technique for prioritizing incoming calls.<br>
FIG* 2 illustrates the operation of the PACA system and protocol for a successful call completion where the user remains in the queue until resovirces become available. Under some circumstances, the system will not allow a PACA request. For example, when resources are not available, or the PACA priority request is not authorized, the system generates a PACA Refusal message, as illustrated in FIG. 4. In FIG. 4, the steps performed at times a-c are identical to the steps performed at times a-c of FIG* 2. That is, the mobile station MS transmits an Origination Message (time a) with the one bijt data field PACAJiEORIG set to "0." The base station BS transmits the Base Station Acknowledgment Order message (time b) to the mobile station MS. The base station BS transmits the CM Service Request message (time c), including the PACA re-origination indicator element set to the same value as the one bit data field PACA^REORIG as well as the data field indicating the availability of resources.<br>
The mobile switching center MSC analyzes the PACA request, as described above, and will generate a PACA Refusal message indicating an unsuccessful origination request, The-.mobile switching center MSC includes appropriate cause values in its message to indicate the reason for a PACA refusal. For example, the PACA request may not be authorized. The information elements of the PACA Failure message are illustrated below in Table 8.<br><br><br>
At time d, the mobile switching center MSC transmits the PACA Refusal message to the base station BS. In certain implementations, a signaling connection control part (SCCF) connection.may be used per call/activity. If the mobile switching center MSC wishes to refuse the SCCP connection request, it may send the PACA Refusal message yja an existing communication protocol, such as the'SCCP Connection Refused (SCCP CREF) primitive.<br>
The base station BS receives the PACA Refusal message, either directly or via the SCCP CREF primitive, and, at time e, transmits a Re-Order Order message to the mobile station MS using the air interface. The Re-Order Order message indicates that the call origination has been rejected. In an exemplary embodiment, the Re-Order Order message received by the base station BS includes the reason for the call rejection.<br>
As previously discussed, the mobile station may move from one cell to another while a PACA request is pending in a process known as an idle handoff. FIG. 5 is a call flow diagram indicating messaging when the mobile " station switches from one cell to another. If the old base station BS and the new base station BS are both controlled by the same base station controller BSC, the two base stations may communicate directly to handoff the mobile station MS and the PACA call request. FIG. 5 illustrates the call flow diagram when the mobile station moves from a cell controlled by a first base station to a cell controlled by a different base station. For example, the mobile station MS 3 in<br><br>
FIG. 1 moves from the cell CI, which is controlled by first base station controller BSC to the cell C4, which is controlled by a different base station controller. Under these circumstances, the mobile switching center MSC must transfer data from the old base station to the new base station in order to maintain the proper position in the queue.<br>
The steps performed at times a-g in FIG. 5 correspond to the steps performed at times a-g in FIG. 2. That is, the Origination Message (time a), Base Station Acknowledgment Order (time b), CM Service Request message (time c), PACA Command message (time d), the optional PACA Complete message (time e), and one or more PACA Messages (times f and g) are identical to the corresponding messages described above with respect to FIG- 2. As the mobile station MS moves to a new cell, the mobile station automatically transmits a new Origination Message at time h. The new Origination Message re-originates the PACA request to the new base station BS. The one bit data field PACAJREORIG is set to a value of "V to indicate to the mobile switching center MSC that this is a Re-Origination Request rather than an Original Request. The new base station BS acknowledges the receipt of the Origination Message with the Base Station Acknowledgment Order to the mobile station MS at time i.<br>
At time j, the new base station BS constructs the CM Service Request message and places it in a complete layer 3 information message, transmits the message to the mobile$witching center MSC and.starts the optional timer T303. *" The new base station BS includes the PACA re-origination indicator element in the CM Service Request message. The PACA re-origination indicator field is set to the same value as the one bit data field PACAJREORIG field (i.e., PACAJREORIG = "1") received in the Origination Message from the mobile station MS. In addition, the mobile switching center MSC receives the call origination and dialed digits in the CM Service Request message, as previously described. By examining the value of the PACA re-origination indicator element, the mobile switching center MSC detects a PACA Re-Origination Request. The mobile switching center MSC recognizes this request as a pending PACA call and need not send a query to the network for authorization. In addition, the mobile switching center MSC receives data (see Table 1) from the new base station BS indicating the availability of resources in the new cell If resources are available in the new cell, a pending PACA call is immediately connected. However, if resources are not immediately available in the new cell, the new base station BS must obtain information regarding the priority and time of the original PACA request.<br><br>
At time k, the mobile switching center MSC sends a PACA Query message to the old base station BS to obtain the PACA information, including the PACA queuing time. In addition, the PACA Query message includes a PACA query flag that indicates to the old base station to clear the PACA request pnce the PACA request information is transmitted to the mobile switching center MSC. This eliminates unnecessary pending PACA requests at the old base station BS. In addition, the mobile switching center MSC starts the timer Tpaca2,<br>
Table 9 below illustrates a structure used for the PACA Query message.<br><br>
i	»,<br>
The old base station BS returns the requested information to the mobile switching center MSC in a PACA Query Acknowledgment message. In addition,! the timer Tpaca2 is stopped. If the time out timer Tpaca2 exceeds a predetermined period {le., the PACA Query Acknowledgment message has not been received within the time out period), the mobile switching center MSC may retransmit the PACA Query Request to the old base station BS, Table 10 below illustrates an example of the data structure used for the PACA Query Acknowledgment message.<br><br><br>
Following transmission of the requested information to the.mobile switching center MSC, the old base station BS removes the pending PACA requests from its queue and may stop any active tuner related to the canceled PACA request.<br>
At time m, the mobile switching center MSC sends a PACA Command message to inform the new base station that PACA was successfully activated for the call The PACA Command message specifies priority level assigned to the user, the PACA queue position, and the PACA queue time information received from the old base station BS. An example of the data structure used for the PACA Command message is provided in Table'2 above.<br>
The new base station BS prioritizes the pending call based on the time of the original call rather than the time of the transfer from the old base station to the new base station. In this manner, the user is assured that their priority will be maintained. It should be noted that the absolute location in the queue may change as a result of switching to a new ceil That is, the location within the queue at the new base station BS will be determined in light of the priority levels of other pending calls in the queue at the new base station. If the user was fifth in line at the old base station (based on priorities and times of arrival of other calls at the old base station), the user may be lower in the queue (e.g., tenth in line) at the new base station because*there may be a larger fvumber of higher priority pending PACA requests or a larger number of pending PACA requests of the same priority that arrived earlier in time than the original call at the old base station. Of course, it is also possible that the absolute position in the queue at the new base station will improve if there are fewer higher priority calls at the new base station.  Thus, while the absolute location in the queue<br><br>
may change, the user is assured that the relative position in the queue is not adversely effected by changing from one cell to another.<br>
At time n, the new base station BS sends an optional PACA Complete message! to the mobile switching center MSC in response to the PACA Command message and halts the optional timer Tpacal. An example of the data structure used for the PACA Complete message is illustrated in Table 6 above.    |<br>
l<br>
Based on the information received in the PACA Command message, the new base station BS queues the pending PACA request and sends an air interface PACA Message to the mobile station MS at-time o. As previously described, the new base station sets the PURPOSE data field in the PACA Message) to "0000" to inform the mobile station MS that the priority call has been queued as a PACA call and to further indicate the queue position.<br>
At time p, the new base station BS may optionally send one or more additional PACA Messages over the paging channel to update the PACA queue call position. If these optional messages are sent, the new base station BS sets the PURPOSE field in the PACA Message to "0001" to indicate that the queue position has been updated.<br>
When a traffic channel becomes available at time q, the new base station<br>
i<br>
BS sends an additional PACA Message over the air interface to instruct the mobile station MS to re-3originate the PACA call. For this PACA Message, the PURPOSp field is sef to "0010" to indicate the PACA&gt;call re-originatipn.      ..,   , .<br>
At time r, the mobile station MS sends a new Origination Message to the new base station BS to request service. As with other Origination Messages, the Origination Message at time r requires a layer 2 acknowledgment. The mobile station MS sets the one bit data field PACA^REORIG to a value of "1" to indicate JPACA re-origination. As previously discussed, the re-Origination Message occurs automatically, without user intervention.<br>
The new base station BS acknowledges the origination Message with a BS Acknowledgment Order Message to the mobile station MS. At this point, the new 1j&gt;ase station BS and the mobile stations follow the conventional mobile origination procedures described in 1S-95-B in section 2.2.2.1.<br>
If the mobile station MS performs an additional idle handoff to another cell, the steps performed at times i-r will be repeated. Thus, the PACA system and protocol of the present invention allow mobility of the user while handing off to nejw cells. The user is assured that their relative priority will not be affected tyy switching to a new cell. On some occasions, the user changes from one cell jo a different cell supported by a different service provider.   Under<br><br>
these circumstances, the PACA system and protocol typically cannot transfer queue data from one base station to another. The pending PACA: Request is terminated and the user must re-initiate a call to the new service provider.<br>
FIG. 6 is a call flow diagram indicating the processing of concurrent PACA calls. That is, FIG. 6 illustrates the processing if the mobile station initiates a first call, which is placed in a PACA queue, and subsequently initiates a second call, which is also placed in a PACA queue. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the steps performed at times a-g correspond with the steps performed at times a-g illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 5. That is, the PACA system and protocol includes an Origination Message (time a) from the mobile station MS to the base station BS, a Base Station Acknowledgment Order message (time b) from the base station to the mobile station, a CM Service Request message (time c) from the base station to the mobile switching center MSC a PACA Command message (time d) from the mobile switching center to the base station, the optional PACA Complete message (time e) from the base station to the mobile switching center, and one or more PACA Messages (times f and g) from the base station to the mobile station. After the transmission of the first PACA Message (time f) from the base station BS to the mobile station MS, the mobile station is in a queue and awaiting assignment of a channel when resources become available. If the mobile station MS initiates another call, the PACA system and protocol of the present invention will cancel the pending:PACA call and process the subsequent call as a new PACA request.<br>
At time h, the mobile station MS originates a second PACA call to another number while the first PACA call (originated and processed at times a-g) is still pending. As previously described, the Origination Message requires a layer 2 acknowledgment message, At time i, the base station BS transmits the Base Station Acknowledgment Order message to the mobile station MS. The base station BS constructs the CM Service Request message and places it in the complete layer 3 information message for transmission to the mobile switching center MSC. At the same time, the base station BS starts the timer 303. An example of the structure used for the CM Service Request message ik provided in Table 1 above, As previously discussed, the CM Service Request message includes the PACA re-origination indicator element, which is set t the same value as the one bit data field PACA_REORIG field received in the Origination Message, Since the current call is also a new call originated by the mobile station MS, the one bit data field PACA.REORIG has a data value Of "0/: The mobile switching center MSC receives the CM Service Request message, which<br>
i<br>
contains the call origination and dialed digits in addition to the fACA Re-<br><br>
origination Indicator (see Table 1). During analysis of the digits, the mobile switching center MSC detects a PACA call request. The mobile switching center MSC sends the request to the network for authorization. If authorization is successful, the call origination is allowed to proceed.<br>
At time k, the mobile switching center MSC sends the PACA Command message;to inform the base station BS that PACA was successfully activated for the newi call. An example of the structure used for the PACA Command message1: is provided in Table 2 above. The PACA Command message specifies the PACA information, including the priority level assigned to the user and the PACA permanent activation, The mobile switching center MSC initiates the optionalitimer Tpacal when the PACA Command message is sent.<br>
The base station BS receives the PACA Command message and processes the command message. Based on the information received in the PACA Command message, the base station BS removes the old-PACA request from the queue and places the new request in the queue. After processing the PACA Command message, the base station BS transmits the optional PACA Complete message to the mobile switching center MSC at time L Upon receipt of the optional PACA Complete message, the mobile switching center MSC stops the timer Tpacal* As previously noted, the mobile switching center MSC may retransmit the PACA Command message if the timer Tpacal expires prior to the receipt of the PACA Complete message,<br>
Inj step m, the base station BS sends an air interface PACA Message to" the mobile station MS. The base station BS sets the PURPOSE data field in the PACA Message to a binary value of "0000" to inform the user that the new priority call has been queued as a PACA call and to indicate the queue position. This effectively terminates the original call, which was previously pending in the PACA queue in the base station BS. Thus, the user is penalized for placing<br>
a second! PACA call while the first PACA call was still pending. The user, in<br>
i<br>
effect, has elected to make the second telephone call a higher priority call Thus, the first pending PACA call is terminated and the second PACA call is assigned! a position in the queue based on its priority level and upon the time of receipt of the second call Origination Message (at time h).<br>
At time n, the base station BS may send one or more optional PACA Messages over the paging channel to update the PACA call queue position. The base station BS may send this message periodically until a voice/traffic channel becomes available. The base station BS sets the PURPOSE data field in the PACA Message to a value of "0001" to indicate that the queue position has been updated.<br><br>
When a traffic channel does become available at rime o, the base station BS sends another PACA Message over the air interface to instruct [the mobile station MS to re-originate the PACA call In this case, the PURPOSE; field of the PACA Message is set to a binary value of "0010" to indicate PACA call re-origination.<br>
At time p, the mobile station MS sends an Origination Message to the base station BS, with a layer 2 acknowledgment required, to request service. As previously discussed, the mobile station MS sets the one bit: data field PACA_REORlG to a value of "1" to indicate PACA re-origination.j At time q, the base station BS acknowledges the Origination Message with a Base Station Acknowledgment Order to the mobile station MS, The mobile station MS and base station BS follow the normal mobile call origination procedures specified in IS-95-B, section 2,2.2,1.<br>
FIGS. 2, 5, and 6 all describe messaging in a situation where the PACA<br>
call is eventually processed by the cellular telephone system. However, under<br>
certain circumstances, a pending PACA request is canceled.  The call may be<br>
canceled by the mobile subscriber MS, the base station BS, or the mobile<br>
switching center MSC. FIG. 7 is a call flow diagram illustrating the processing<br>
by the PACA system and protocol to cancel a call where the call cancellation is<br>
initiated by the mobile station MS. The steps performed at times a-g in FIG, 7<br>
correspond with the steps performed at times a-g of FIGS. 2, 5, and 6. That is,<br>
the protocol includes an Origination Message (time a) from the mobile station<br>
MS to the base, station BS, a Base Station Acknowledgment Ofder message<br>
(time b) from the base station to the mobile switching center, a CM Service<br>
i Request message (time c) from the base station to the mobile switching center<br>
MSC, a PACA Command message (time d) from the mobile switching center to<br>
the base station, the optional PACA Complete message (time e) from the base<br>
station to the mobile switching center, a PACA Message (time f) from the base<br>
station to the mobile station, and one or more optional PACA Messages (time g)<br>
from the base station to the mobile station.<br>
At time h, the mobile station MS transmits a PACA Cancel message over the access channel of the air interface to the base* station BS to cancel the pending PACA request. The PACA Cancel message requires a layer 2 acknowledgment.<br>
At time i, the base station BS cancels the pending PACA call and removes the request from the PACA queue. The base station BS then transmits a PACA Cancel jnessage to the mobile switching center MSC to indicate that<br><br>
the PACA call has been canceled-  Table 11 below illustrates an example of a structure used to implement the PACA Cancel message.<br><br>
a.	Allowable cause values are; "PACA cancellation requested by the MS" in the<br>
BS to MSC direction and "PACA cancellation requested by the MSC in the<br>
" MSC to BS direction.<br>
b.	This element is included in the message only in the BS to MSC direction and<br>
if the air interface PACA Message included the ESN.<br>
c This element is included in the message only in the MSC to BS direction.<br>
It should be noted that the PACA Cancel message is sent by the base station BS if the mobile station is initiating the PACA cancellation, but may also be transmitted by the mobile switching center MSC to the base station if the mobile switching center is initiating the PACA cancellation (see FIG. 9).<br>
At time j, the base station BS transmits the Base Station Acknowledgment Order to the mobile station MS to confirm the PACA cancellation.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the call flow diagram for PACA call cancellation initiated!by the mobile station MS. FIG. 8 is a call flow diagram indicating the messaging performed by the PACA system and protocol of the present invention for call cancellation initiated by the mobile switching center MSC. The steps performed at times a-g of FIG. 8 correspond to the steps performed at times a-g of FIGS. 2 and 5-7.   That is, the orocpss inrJnWcc *ha rw;~;--i.i—<br><br>
Message (time a) from the mobile station MS to the base station BS, a Base Station Acknowledgment Order (time b) from the base station to the mobile station, a CM Service Request (time c) from the base station to the mobile switching center MSC, the PACA Command message (time'd) from the mobile switching center to the base station, the optional PACA Complete message (time e) from the base station to the mobile switching center, the PACA message (time f) from the base station to the mobile station, and one or more optional PACA messages (time g) from the base station to the mobile .station.<br>
At time h, the mobile switching center initiates a PACA cancellation by transmitting a PACA Cancel message to the base station BS. As previously noted, Table 11 provides an example of a structure used for the PACA Cancel message. In addition, the mobile switching center MSC starts the optional timer Tpaca3, which is a time out timer,<br>
At time i, the base station BS cancels the PACA call and removes the request from the PACA queue. The base station then sends a PACA Message to the mobile station MS to indicate that the PACA call has been canceled. As previously noted in Table 7, the PACA message has a PURPOSE data field. In the present case, the PACA data field is set to a value of "0011" to indicate to the mobile station MS that the PACA call has been canceled.<br>
At- time j, the mobile station MS transmits an MS Acknowledgment Order to the base station BS to acknowledge the PACA cancellation. Lrpon receiving the MS Acknowledgment Order from the mobile station MS, the base station BS may send an optional PACA Cancel Acknowledge message to the mobile switching center MSC to confirm PACA cancellation, shown in FIG. 8 at time k. Table 12 below illustrates an example of a structure used for the PACA Cancel Acknowledge message.<br><br><br>
A&amp; previously discussed, the communication channel between the base station BS and the mobile switching center MSC is highly reliable. Accordingly acknowledgment messages transmitted between the base station BS and the mobile switching center MSC are optional. It should be noted that the optional PACA Cancel Acknowledge message is transmitted by the base station BS when the mobile switching center MSC initiates the PACA cancellation (see FIG, 8), ^nd is transmitted from the mobile switching center to the base station when the base station initiates the PACA cancellation (see FIG,-9)., Upon receiving the PACA Cancel message from the base station BS, the mobile switching center MSC stops the timer Tpaca3.<br>
The mobile switching center MSC may initiate the PACA call cancellation illustrated in FIG, 8 if the mobile switching center has insufficient resourced to process the call. Under other circumstances, the base station BS may have insufficient resources to process the call or may have additional higher priority calls that have been received. Under these circumstances, the base station BS may initiate a call cancellation. FIG. 9 is a call flow diagram indicating the message and processing by the PACA system and protocol of the present invention for call cancellation initiated by the base station BS. The steps performed at times a-g in FIG. 9 are identical to the steps performed at times a-g of FIGjS. 2 and 5-8. That is, the process includes the Origination Message (time a)|from the mobile station MS to the base station BS, a Base Station Acknowjedgment Order (time b) from the base station to the mobile station, a ■ CM Service Request message (time c) from the base station to the mobile switching center MSC, the PACA Command message (time d) from the mobile<br><br>
switching center to the base station, the optional PACA Complete message (time e) from the base station to the mobile switching center, the PACA Message (time f) from the base station to the mobile station, and one or more optional PACA Messages (time g) from the base station to the mobile station.<br>
At this point; the PACA call is in a queue and awaiting the availability or resources. However, under some circumstances, such as when the base station BS receives a large number of higher priority calls, the pending PACA call may be canceled by the base station. Under such circumstances, at time-h, the base station BS initiates a PACA request cancellation by sending a PACA Message from the base station to the mobile station MS. As previously discussed, the PACA Message has a PURPOSE data field that is set to a value of "0011" to indicate PACA cancellation.<br>
At time i, the mobile station MS cancels the PACA call and transmits an MS Acknowledgment Order to the base station BS to confirm PACA . cancellation. Upon receipt of the MS Acknowledgment Order, the base station BS sends a PACA Cancel message to the mobile switching center MSC, at time j, to indicate that the PACA origination has been canceled. An example of a data structure used for the PACA Cancel message is provided in Table 11 above. The base station BS may optionally start the timer Tpaca3.<br>
Upon receipt of the PACA Cancel message from the base station BS„the mobile switching* center MSC may send the optional PACA Cancel Acknowledgment message to the base station in response to the PACA Cancel message. The PACA Cancel Acknowledgment message is transmitted to the base station BS at time k. An example of the data structure used for the PACA Cancel Acknowledgment message is provided in Table 12 above. Upon receipt of the PACA Cancel Acknowledgment message, the base station BS stops the timer Tpaca3.<br>
Thus, the PACA system and protocol of the present invention allows great flexibility in implementing PACA capability in an existing cellular telephone system. The system also advantageously minimizes the amount of messaging, particularly messaging to the mobile switching center MSC. This reduced overhead increases the resources available for call processing.<br>
It is to be understood that even though various embodiments and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the' foregoing description, the above disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, yet remain within the broad principles of the invention, Therefore, the present invention is to be limited only by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
