				<td>PURPOSE: To obtain a circuit applying AGC operation by keeping a multiple factor independently of an APD current at small reception power constant and making the APD current constant at large reception power. CONSTITUTION: A FET bias circuit 2 shows a resistance characteristic with unsaturation voltage when a drain-source voltage of a FET is 0.5V or below and shows a constant current characteristic with the saturation when the voltage is 1V or over. Then the current of the circuit 2 is set to obtain a maximum operating current of the APD 1. When reception power is small, since the APD voltage and the terminal voltage at the circuit 2 are nearly made constant, the multiple factor of the APD 1 is nearly constant, the gain of an AGC amplifier 7 has a constant characteristic to attain the AGC operation. The APD current is made constant by the circuit 2 at a region where the reception power is large. Thus, the APD multiple factor is decreased inversely proportional to the reception power to attain the AGC operation. COPYRIGHT: (C) JPO</td>

				<td>A method and an optical receiver for measuring optical power<br>
The invention relates to a method of measuring optical power<br>
by and an optical receiver means of an avalanche pho-<br>
todiode, wherein an electrical signal is generated in re¬sponse to and as an indication of the optical power inci¬dent on the photodiode. The electrical signal is deter¬mined as a function of a current generated in the photo-diode by the optical power when the incident optical power is lower than a selected limit value, and the pho¬todiode current is limited to a constant value when the incident optical power exceeds this limit value.<br>
Optical systems, such as e.g. fibre transmission systems for telecommunications purposes, utilize optical receiv¬ers to convert optical power into a corresponding elec¬trical signal. It may be a receiver for communications signals proper, or merely a unit for measuring the mean value of the received optical power. The active component in such receivers will frequently be a photodiode through which a current is generated in response to the incident optical power. This current is frequently referred to as the photocurrent. Usually, the current in the photodiode will be substantially proportional to the optical power incident on the photodiode, so that a greater optical power will mean a greater current. When the current in the diode increases, increasing electrical power will dissipate in the diode, whose temperature therefore also increases. This puts an upper limit to how much current and thus how much optical power the diode can tolerate.<br>
For certain photodiode types, such as e.g. avalanche pho-todiodes, this upper limit of the photocurrent means that their dynamic range for the received optical power is<br>
considerably smaller than for other types of optical re¬ceivers. Since, however, the avalanche photodiodes have other advantages in optical receivers, e.g. a consider¬ably better sensitivity at low optical powers, it is de¬sirable to expand their dynamic range upwardly.<br>
US Patent No. 4 473 745 discloses an optical receiver, in which the photodiode is a p-i-n diode and the dynamic range is expanded by coupling a forward-biased corre¬sponding p-i-n diode in series with the photodiode in¬stead of a resistor like before. This reduces the voltage swing, which is passed on to an amplifier input, thereby achieving an improved dynamic range. This method, how¬ever, is applicable only with p-i-n diodes, and the ava¬lanche photodiodes already have a considerably smaller dynamic range than the p-i-n diodes.<br>
JP Patent Application No. 64-160739 discloses an optical receiver using an avalanche photodiode. At small values of the incident optical power, the current through the diode increases substantially in proportion to the opti¬cal power. The current is converted by means of a small resistor to a corresponding voltage value, which may thus be used as a measure of the incident optical power. At great values of the incident optical power, the current through the diode is limited to a constant value to avoid overloading the amplifier. This also protects the diode against destruction because of a too high temperature; but it affords no possibility of expanding the dynamic range so that also great values of optical power can be measured by means of the diode, it being impossible with this circuit to measure the optical power when the cur¬rent is limited.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a method of the type stated in the opening paragraph in<br>
which, the dynamic range for the measurement of the inci¬dent optical power may be expanded to considerably greater values of the optical power than has been poss¬ible in the past.<br>
This is achieved according to the invention in that when the incident optical power exceeds the limit value, the electrical signal, which is indicative of the optical power incident on the photodiode, is substantially deter¬mined so that it comprises a contribution which is a function of the voltage across the photodiode.<br>
When the current in an avalanche photodiode for great values of the optical power is kept at a constant level/ the voltage across the diode drops instead when the opti¬cal power increases, as the multiplication factor of the diode is voltage-dependent. When the optical power in¬creases, the multiplication factor and thus the voltage across the diode drop. The voltage drop may therefore be used as a measure of the dynamic power in this range, and the dynamic range has thus been expanded considerably.<br>
An expedient embodiment is achieved when the photodiode is provided with a constant supply voltage for optical powers lower than the limit value, and the electrical signal is determined so that it is proportional to the current in the photodiode, as stated in claims 2 and 3.<br>
When, as stated in claim 4, the incident optical power exceeds the limit value, the electrical signal may advan¬tageously be determined so that said contribution is pro¬portional to the difference between a fixed supply volt¬age and the voltage across the photodiode/ since this will result in a signal which increases with increasing optical power.<br>
When, as stated in claim 5, the electrical signal for op¬tical powers above the limit value is determined as the sum of a contribution proportional to the current in the photodiode and a contribution proportional to the differ¬ence between a fixed supply voltage and the voltage across the photodiode, it is ensured that the same elec¬trical signal may be used as a measure of- the incident optical power in the entire expanded dynamic range.<br>
A particularly expedient embodiment is obtained when, as stated in claim 6, an InGaAs avalanche photodiode is used, since this diode type has a substantially linear relation between the incident optical power and the volt¬age drop across the diode when the diode current is kept constant.<br>
As mentioned, the invention also relates to an optical receiver of the stated type. When, as stated in claim 7, the receiver comprises means for determining the electri¬cal signal so that it comprises a contribution which is a function of the voltage across the photodiode when the incident optical power exceeds the limit value, it is en¬sured - as described above - that the voltage drop may be used as a measure of the optical power for great values of the optical power, and the dynamic range of the re¬ceiver has thus been expanded considerably.<br>
An expedient embodiment is obtained, as stated in claims 8 and 9, when the receiver, for optical values lower than the limit value, can supply the diode with a constant supply voltage and determine the electrical signal so that it is proportional to the current in the photodiode.<br>
When the incident optical power exceeds the limit value, the receiver may advantageously be adapted to determine said contribution so that it is proportional to the dif-<br>
ference between a fixed supply voltage and the voltage across the photodiode, as stated in claim 10, since this results, in a signal which increases with increasing opti¬cal power.<br>
When, as stated in claim, 11, the receiver is capable of determining the electrical signal for optical powers above the limit value as the sum of a contribution pro¬portional to the current in the photodiode and a contri¬bution proportional to the difference between a fixed supply voltage and the voltage across the photodiode, it is ensured that the same electrical signal may be used as a measure of the incident optical power in the entire ex¬panded dynamic range.<br>
A particularly expedient embodiment is obtained when, as stated in claim 12, the photodiode is an InGaAs avalanche photodiode, since this diode type has a substantially linear relation between the incident optical power and the voltage drop across the diode when the diode current is kept constant.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a method of measuring optical power by means of an avalanche photodiode, wherein an electrical signal is generated in response to and as an indication of the optical power incident on the photodiode, said electrical signal being determined as a function of a current generated in the photodiode by the optical power, when the incident optical power is lower than a selected limit value, said current in the photodiode being limited to a constant value when the incident optical power exceeds this limit value, characterized in that when the<br>
incident optical power exceeds-, the limit value,, the electrical<br>
signal is determined such so as herein described  that it comprises a contribution which<br>
is a function of the voltage across the photodiode.<br>
The present invention also relates to an optical receiver adapted to generate an electrical signal in response to and as an indication of optical power incident on an avalanche photodiode by the method as described hereinabove, said receiver comprising:<br>
means for determining said electrical signal in response to a current generated in the photodiode by the optical power, and means for limiting the current in the photodiode to a constant value when the incident optical power, exceeds a selected limit value, characterized in that the receiver moreover comprises means for determining the electrical signal so that is comprises a contribution which is a function of the voltage across the photodiode when the incident optical power exceeds the limit value.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described more fully below with reference to the drawing, in which<br>
fig. I shows a known optical receiver having an avalanche photodiode,<br>

fig. 4 shows the relation between the multiplication fac¬tor M and the voltage drop for an avalanche photodiode of InGaAs type,<br>
fig. 5 correspondingly shows 1/M as a function of the voltage drop for the same diode as fig. 4,<br>
fig. 6 shows an example of diode voltage as a function of incident optical power for an avalanche photodiode of In-GaAs type,<br>
fig. 7 shows an example of how the invention may be im¬plemented, and<br>
fig. 8 shows the curve shapes of a plurality of electri¬cal signals in the circuit of fig. 7 as a function of in¬cident optical power.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example of how an avalanche photodiode 1 may be used in a manner known per se in a receiver for optical signals from e.g. an optical fibre 2. The photo-diode 1 is supplied with an electrical DC voltage +V0.-A current limiting circuit 3 and a small resistor 4 are also inserted in series with the photodiode' 1. In the usual operational range of the photodiode, the current limiting circuit 3 serves as a short-circuit, and the re¬sistor 4 is selected at a sufficiently small value for the voltage +V0 to be across the diode in practice.<br>
The resistor 4 is used for measuring the current Id through the diode, as the same current will run in the resistor and thus give rise to voltage drop across the resistor in proportion to the current. This voltage is fed to an amplifier 5, and since the diode current Id, as will be described below, varies with the incident optical power Pin, the output of the amplifier 5 provides an electrical signal Vmon which may be used as an indication of the incident optical power.<br>
The circuit shown has a relatively limited bandwidth. For low-frequency communications signals, it may be used for receiving these, while for high-frequency communications signals it may be used for measuring the optical mean power. In this situation, the communications signals are received by a more complex receiver circuit.<br>
The photodiode 1 has the property that the diode current Id, when the diode is biased by a suitable bias voltage, is proportional to the optical power Pln incident on the diode. For photodiodes which are not of avalanche type, the diode current Id is given by the expression Id = R • Pin, where R is called the responsitivity of the diode and is a constant for the diode type concerned. In an avalanche photodiode, because of avalanche multiplica¬tion, the current will be a multiplication factor M greater than the corresponding current without avalanche multiplication, and the diode current will therefore be given by the expression Id = M • R • Pin.<br>
M depends on the voltage across the diode, but since this will be constant here, as mentioned, also M will be con¬stant and the current will therefore vary in proportion to Pln.<br>
If Vmon, which corresponds to Id, is plotted as a function of Pin, a straight line 6 will be obtained, as shown in fig. 2. The linear relationship between Pin and Vmon makes it easier to use the diode for measuring the optical power, and in case of low-frequency signals it lends it¬self as a receiver in both analog and digital applica¬tions.<br>
However, there is an upper limit to how great the current Id may be, since a too great current can overload the am¬plifier 5 and dissipate so much thermal energy in the di-<br><br>
ode that this is destroyed. The current limiting circuit 3 is therefore adapted such that it allows currents up to a maximum value Imax to pass unobstructedly, and to re¬strict greater currents to Imax. This means that when the incident optical power exceeds the value PI which corre¬sponds to Imax/ the current will be maintained at the value Imax. The same applies to the voltage Vmon which is maintained at the value Vmon,max, as shown by the line 7 in fig. 2.<br>
Thus:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where ki is a constant which corresponds to the inclina¬tion of the line 6 and which depends i.a. on the diode responsitivity, the multiplication, the size of the re¬sistor 4 and the gain in the amplifier 5.<br>
It should be noted that in practice the circuit will fre¬quently be designed in another manner which is illus¬trated in fig. 3. The photodiode 1, the resistor 4 and the amplifier 5 are the same as in fig. 1, whereas the current limitation is established differently. A DC cur¬rent generator 8 provides a constant current of Imax. At small values of the incident optical power, the diode current will be smaller than Imax, and the surplus current will instead flow through the Zener diode 9 which then keeps the voltage across the photodiode 1 constant. When the optical power increases, the diode current will reach Imax at some time, and since the current generator cannot provide a greater current, the entire Imax will now enter into the photodiode. The Zener diode 9 will then be inef¬fective, and, here too, Vmon will have the course shown in fig. 2.<br>
It should also be noted that a so-called current mirror may be used in order to prevent the resistor 4 from being in series with the photodiode, said current mirror being a circuit which is adapted to pass exactly the same cur¬rent in two branches. The resistor and the photodiode are placed in their respective branches, and the circuit will then pass the same current through the resistor as flows in the branch having the photodiode, and, like before, the voltage drop across the resistor will be proportional to the current in the photodiode. Such a current mirror may be used, no matter whether the circuit in general is designed like in fig. 1 or like in fig. 3.<br>
Limitation of the current as described above ensures that the diode is not destroyed when the optical power exceeds<br>
PI; but it also means that the upper limit of the dynamic<br>
j<br>
range of the circuit is limited to this value. This is a problem in particular for avalanche photodiodes, since the upper limit of the dynamic range for these will typi¬cally be lower than for other photodiodes, and it is therefore desired to expand the dynamic range upwards. This is made possible by the invention.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that if the diode current for an avalanche photodiode is kept constant, while the optical power continues to increase, the volt¬age across the diode will decrease. The voltage across the diode may therefore be used as measure of the optical power when this exceeds the limit value PI.<br>
The reason is that, as mentioned above, the multiplica¬tion factor M varies with the voltage across the ava¬lanche photodiode. Fig. 4 shows an example of M as a function of the diode voltage Vd for an InGaAs avalanche photodiode. M increases infinitely at a voltage Vbr which is referred to as the breakdown voltage and which is<br>
about 70 volts for the photodiode shown. This curve sig¬nifies that M in the active range is substantially in¬versely proportional to Vd, it being also possible to plot the relation with approximation as shown in fig. 5 which shows 1/M as a function of Vd. Therefore, with said approximation, 1/M may be expressed as:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where k2 is a constant which indicates the inclination of the line i fig. 5, and which depends on the properties of the diode type concerned.<br>
When the incident optical power continues to increase, while the diode current is maintained at the value Imax, the diode will still try to observe the equation Id = M • R • Pln. Since Id is now equal to Imax the equation will instead be: Imax = M • R • Pin. When Pin increases, the equation can be satisfied only if M is reduced corre¬spondingly at the same time. The diode voltage will therefore adjust itself to the voltage corresponding to the value of M which satisfies the equation. This voltage can therefore be found by inserting the above expression of 1/M into the equation Imax = M • R • Pin and solving it with respect to Vd.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
It will thus be seen that Vd as a function of Pin will substantially be linear when the diode current is main¬tained at the value Imax. Fig. 6 shows an example of how -the diode voltage may look as a function of the incident optical power Pin. When Pin is below the value PI, the voltage is constantly V0, as described above, since in this range it is the current in the diode which varies. In the range from PI to P2 the voltage varies linearly according to the above expression of Vd. P2 is the value of Pin where Vd is zero, i.e.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
When Pin exceeds P2, the expression Imax = M • R • Pin can no longer be satisfied, and the voltage will substantially be zero as the diode will cease to operate as a photodi-ode.<br>
It should be noted that the above calculations apply to avalanche photodiodes of the InGaAs type. Corresponding calculations may be made for other avalanche photodiodes; but here the multiplication M as a function of the volt¬age across the diode will frequently have a different course, and the diode voltage Vd as a function of Pin at constant diode current will therefore not necessarily be linear as described above. This, however, may be compen¬sated by well-known compensation circuits, if necessary for the application concerned.<br>
Fig. 7, which corresponds to fig. 1, shows an example of how the invention may be implemented, where, for optical powers below PI, the diode current Id is used as an indi¬cator of the optical power, and the diode voltage Vd is similarly used for powers between Pa ' and P2 . The diode<br>
voltage will look like the upper curve (curve A) in fig. 8. This curve corresponds completely to the one shown in fig. 6. It is noted that the voltage drop across the re¬sistor 4 is sufficiently small for it to be disregarded «with respect to Vd.<br>
When the voltage across the diode decreases, a voltage drop, which is the difference between +V0 and Vd, will occur across the current limitation circuit 3. Measure¬ment of this voltage with a differential amplifier 10 will give an electrical signal Viim which will look as shown in fig. 8, curve B, and which is given by:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where k3 is a constant determined by the gain in the am¬plifier 10.<br>
The signal Vlim may then be added to the signal Vmon (curve C) in an adding circuit 11 to give the signal Vpwr, which is shown as curve D in fig. 8 and is given by:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
This signal may now be used as a measure of the incident optical power both below and above the limit value PI, as the signal increases during the entire range up to P2 and therefore gives a unique relation between Vpwr and Pin.<br>
As appears from curve D in fig. 8, a kink occurs at PI, as the curve has a steeper inclination at small values of the incident optical power than is the case at powers<br>
above PI. This will frequently be expedient, since it is desirable to have a great sensitivity at the small powers - and this is precisely one of the advantages of the ava¬lanche photodiode over other photodiode types - while be¬ing capable of tolerating the greater powers without overloading of the diode.<br>
Since, however, the inclination of the two parts of the curve is determined by the gains in the amplifiers 5 and 10, nothing prevents these from being selected such that the curve has the same inclination all the way from 0 to P2, as shown on curve E in fig. 8. This means that there is a linear relation between the signal Vpwr and the inci¬dent optical power in the entire dynamic range of the re¬ceiver .<br>
It should be noted that the measuring principle shown in fig. 7 may also be applied of course if the circuit around the photodiode is designed as shown in fig. 3, since the constant voltage V0 is just to be fed to the amplifier 10 from somewhere else in the circuit.<br>
It should moreover be noted that a circuit like the one described will frequently be used in optical telecommuni¬cations systems where a bit flow of digital signals is transmitted. These signals will typically be modulated on the optical signal so that the optical power switches be¬tween a low value (corresponding to logic 0) and a high value (corresponding to logic 1) . If the modulation fre¬quency is sufficiently low, this means that switching will take place between two points on the above-mentioned curve D (or curve E) . Depending on the information con¬tents, these switchings may take place with a frequency up to the bit frequency of the transmission system con¬cerned.<br><br>
In modern transmission systems, the bit frequency may be as high as e.g. 2.5 GHz or 10 GHz, and at these high fre¬quencies the shown circuits cannot operate, as they may have an upper limit frequency of e.g. 5 kHz. This applies particularly if the current mirror previously mentioned is used. In that case, the signal Vpwr will no longer con¬tain the high-frequency information, but will instead be indicative of the mean power, which, however, is also an important parameter of such transmission systems. The ac¬tual high-frequency information contents of the diode current can then be detected by a special high-frequency detector circuit which may be designed in a well-known manner.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described and shown, the invention is not re¬stricted to this, but may also be embodied in many other ways within the scope of the subject-matter defined in the appended claims.   <br><br><br><br><br><br>
