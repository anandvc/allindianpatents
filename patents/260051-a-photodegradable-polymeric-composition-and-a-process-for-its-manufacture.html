				<td>THIS   INVENTION   RELATES   TO   A   PHOTODEGRADABLE   POLYMERIC<br>
COMPOSITION AND A PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTURE.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Particularly, the invention relates to a photodegradable polymeric composition containing a virgin polymer component and certain degradants (hereinafter defined) as a facilitating agent for photodegradation of the said composition. More particularly, the invention relates to a polymeric composition containing polyolefin or its copolymer or their blend, which may include without restriction, polyethylene (PE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), as virgin polymer.<br>
Polyolefins or its copolymer having processing temperature less than 170 C are preferred.<br>
Still more particularly, the invention relates to a polymeric composition that contains transition metal derivative of a hydrophilic polymer, containing carboxylic acid groups as a degradant. Specifically, the degradant used could be transition metal derivative of SMA. Further, the transition metals include, without limitation, iron, cobalt, nickel, or manganese preferably iron. These derivatives of SMA copolymer act as photoinitiator, and are generally used as an additive. Yet more particularly, the invention relates to a polymeric composition that has good storage stability, good mechanical properties and better processability. The invention specifically relates to a polymeric composition that is much cheaper than the existing compositions as the photoinitiators used, are often synthesized from cheaper raw material. The composition thus prepared gets degraded when exposed to sunlight or source of UV light. The degradant used enhances the process of degradation with exposure to light via<br>
photodegradation. Thus the plastics, when are dumped on the ground get easily degraded and converted to innocuous material in presence of soil and hght.<br>
Further the composition can be made directly in the form of various shapes using any known methods or prepared in the form of master batch formulation. The films prepared by using the composition of the present invention can be used as a mulch or in a row cover applications as it lose significant amount of its tensile strength in about 30 to 90 days. The invention also provides a process for manufacturing the composition of this invention. The process makes use of easily available cheaper raw material. Further, the process does not require any sophisticated infrastructure or stringent process conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Plastics are used extensively in almost every field. Among the various applications, plastics are used mostly in packaging. The use of plastics has given rise to improved methods of packaging goods. For example, polyethylene and polypropylene plastic films, bags, bottles, Styrofoam cups, blister packages, and the like provide stable, relatively unbreakable, chemically resistant lightweight packaging. Conventional plastics used for packaging include, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terphthalate, and polyvinyl chloride. Plastics have also found wide spread use in other disposable products such as, for example, disposable personal care products such as diapers, disposable work tools/ instruments/garments, and other disposable garments. Plastics with a fairly long life are also used as a green house material. While plastics with a life of about 30 to 80 days are found useful as mulch or in row cover applications. The many advantages of plastics have<br>
lead to their increased usage in a variety of products. This increased usage, however, has resulted in accumulation of huge amount of solid waste, since the plastic must be disposed of after it is used and thereby has created a serious environmental problem. As a result of the stability and durability of plastics, however, they tend to remain in our environment for a long lime, without decomposing after disposal. It has been estimated that over 50 percent of the annual tonnage of all manufactured synthetic polymers are applied as packaging materials and that 90 percent of this ends up as a component of urban garbage. It has also been estimated that recalcitrant plastic accumulates in our environment at a rate of 25 million tons per year.<br>
Burning of plastics is an unsatisfactory disposal solution, since this tends to discharge smoke that adds to air pollution and destruction of the ozone layer. Similarly plastics are not readily degraded or decomposed by natural means, such as degradation by micro-organisms, which degrade most other forms of organic matter and return such matter to the biological life cycle. Thus, burial in a waste site is also not an effective means of disposal. Composting is also not advisable due to non-degradable nature of the plastics. The resulting accumulation of plastics in our environment has tended to result in landfills becoming filled to capacity; unsightly litter destroying the scenery and landscape; and destruction of the living environment for marine life and other forms of life in turn impairing ecosystem as a whole. In an effort to resolve the environmental problem, several techniques have been adopted to attribute the degradable characteristics to the polymer. It is achieved by copolymerisation of ethylene with monomers like vinyl ketone, methyl iso-propyl ketone, methyl vinyl ketone and carbon monoxide. A reference can be made to-Li, S.K.L.; Guillet, G.E.J. Polym Sc (Polym Chem), 1980, 18, 2221. The problem can also be solved by incorporating additives in<br>
transition metal. The plastic will continue to oxidize in the dark after an initial exposure to<br>
ultraviolet light.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,994,855 discloses thermoplastic polymers or copolymers of a-olefins<br>
containing one or more transition metals. The polymer compositions are degraded under the<br>
action of sunlight and/or ultraviolet light and may also be subject to thermal degradation.<br>

The   composition   comprises   (1)  polyolefin,   (2)   iron   in  the   form   of alkaU   metal<br>
trioxalatoferrate and (3) photosensitizing organic compound selected from aromatic ketones<br>
and aldehyde.<br>

fatty acid or ester of a fatty acid and a monohydric aliphatic alcohol, and optionally an<br>

halo benzenesulfonamide as photosensitizing agent.<br>

U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,851 discloses a degradable plastic composition comprising an organic<br>
polymeric material having dispersed therein at least one ethylenically unsaturated alcohol or<br>
ethylenically unsaturated ester derived therefrom as a readily autoxidizable substance.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,360,606 discloses a plastic composition containing an organic photosensitizer<br>
certain ways with the polymeric compositions used to make plastics to increase the rate at which the plastic is degraded to environmentally friendly compounds. These additives, commonly called degradants, increase the rate of degradation of the plastic. The degradation could be photodegradation, biological degradation, and/or chemical degradation. However, blending of the degradants with the virgin polymer affects the other properties of the plastics such as mechanical strength and resistance to moisture. As the term indicates, Photodegradation involves reaction with atmospheric oxygen particularly in the presence of light. Typically, a photosensitizing agent is employed in order to accelerate the rate of degradation. The photosensitizing agent absorbs ultraviolet light (e.g., from sunlight) and in the photo-excited state, then undergoes a chemical reaction that leads to the generation of free radicals, which leads to an auto-oxidation and eventual disintegration of the plastic. Photodegradation has generally involved two technological approaches: (a) introduction of photosensitive functional group into the polymer; or (b) adding of photosensitive reagents to the polymer. Introducing autooxidisable group in the synthetic polymer may accelerate the thermal oxidation that follows the initial photochemical initiation step. The oxidisable groups may be copolymerised or grafted with functional monomer. The relevant prior art known to the inventor includes the following patents: US patent No 3,935,141 and literature published as early as 1989 teaches incorporation of cerium salts into polyethylene essentially containing an antioxidant such as titanium dioxide to accelerate photodegradation. It also suggests addition of other adjuvants. U.S. Pat. No. 3,941,759 discloses a degradable plastic containing an organic photosensitizer and at least one organic derivative of a transition metal. Degradation is initiated by a photo-oxidative reaction of the photosensitizer and is sustained by the organic derivative of a<br>
and at least one readily autoxidizable organic substance. Exposure of the polymeric material<br>
to an artificial source of light or sunlight initiates a chemical degradation process. The initial<br>
photochemical reaction is followed by susbequent reactions that are essentially thermal (i.e.,<br>
non-photochemical).    The   readily   autoxidizable   substance   accelerates   the   thermal<br>
autoxidation step that follows the initial photochemical step.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,461,853 discloses a controllably degradable vinyl polymer composition that<br>

biodegradable substance, such as starch; a transition metal compound; and a fatty acid or<br>
ester of a fatty acid. The compositions may further include one or more other transition metal<br>
compounds to catalyze degradation of the polymer. The polymer compositions are degraded<br>
under the action of heat and/or ultraviolet light.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,645 discloses that the addition of camphorquinone to polyethylene<br>
accelerates the photodegradation of the polymer when the polymer is exposed to ultraviolet<br>
light.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,939 discloses a polymeric composition with enhanced reactivity toward oxidative and/or photo-oxidative degradation. The rate of degradation is enhanced by incorporating at least one alkoxylated ethylenically unsaturated compound as an organic photosensitizer. The compositions may further include other readily oxidizable substances. US Patent No. 5,096,941 advocates incorporation of cerium stearate in polyolefins to promote thermo-oxidation and photo-oxidation.<br>

No. 5,444,107 discloses a degradable polymer composition consisting essentially of a thermoplastic polymer composition comprising primarily polylactic acid or a copolymer of lactic acid and another hydroxy-carboxylic acid and starch and/or modified starch. The varying the amount of starch and/or modified starch controls the degradation rate of the polymer composition.<br>

composition includes starch chemically bonding to polyethylene with a coupling agent, a<br>
radical initiator, a Lewis acid, an autooxidizing agent, and a plasticizer.<br>

transition metal compound, a second transition metal compound, and an aromatic ketone.<br>
The second transition metal compound acts as a catalyst with the first transition metal<br>
compound to enhance degradation of the thermoplastic material. The aromatic ketone has a<br>
synergistic effect that increases photodegradation of the plastic.<br>
WO 94/13735 discloses degradable thermoplastic compositions. The compositions include a<br>
thermoplastic polymer component combined with a directly biodegradable component, an<br>
oxidizable component, transition metal additives, and an aromatic ketone. The polymeric<br>
material degrades in three stages. The first stage is biological removal of the directly biodegradable component, which results in mass reduction and a highly porous material. The second stage is chemical and results in oxidative shortening of the long polymer chains to decrease their molecular weight and the third stage involves biological metabolism of the low molecular weight fragments.<br>
rhe resultant disadvantages in the utilization of various raw materials as accelerating agents for polyolefins include, without restriction, factors such as toxicity, discoloration, lack of easy accessibility, high cost, less efficient, requirement of sophisticated infrastructure and the large amounts employed in order to be effective.<br>

samples were exposed at an angle equal to the latitude of the place.<br>
Films were regularly taken out from exposure site and carbonyl index of the films were<br>
determined after every 30 days, using FTIR spectra. The Carbonyl index was calculated by<br>
taking the ratio of peaks obtained at 1715 and 1885 cm"'. The variation is shown in figure 2<br>

Maleic anhydride and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) from CDH, India, decanol, methyl ethyl ketone and petroleum ether from Qualigen Chemicals, Glaxo, India and were used without any further purification. Synthesis<br>
SMA was synthesized by precipitation polymerization using 1:1 molar ratio of styrene and maleic anhydride at 80°C for 3 hours using xylene as solvent and BPO as free radical initiator in nitrogen atmosphere with continuous stirring. The reaction was carried out in a glass reaction kettle equipped with a glass mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet tube and a cooling condenser. The monomer mixture along with initiator was added slowly over a period of 2 hours to ensure controlled polymerization and the reaction was carried out for another 1 hour to ensure complete polymerization. SMA was precipitated as fine white<br>
powder during polymerization. SMA powder was filtered, washed with petroleum ether and was dried in a thermostat at 80°C. Example I<br>
1:1 molar ratio of styrene and maleic anhydride was reacted at 80°C-100 °C for 2.5-4 hours using xylene as solvent and BPO as free radical initiator in nitrogen atmosphere with continuous stirring. The reaction was carried out in a glass reaction kettle fitted with mechanical stirrer SMA was precipitated as fine white powder during polymerization. SMA powder was filtered, washed with petroleum ether and was dried in a thermostat at 80°C. SMA (lOOg) as prepared herein above was dissolved in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. To this solution Aqueous ferric chloride solution (prepared by dissolving 79 g of anhydrous ferric chloride in 200 ml of water) was added. The brown precipitate formed was filtered and dried in thermostat oven at 50°C. TSMA (Fe) thus obtained was used as photoinitiator in LLDPE.<br>
2 % TSMA (Fe) was mixed with film grade LLDPE (MFI ~ 0.9) in a single screw extruder. The masterbatch was fiirther diluted with LLDPE so that final composition of TSMA (Fe) lies in range 0.1-0.5%. The compositions were made into form of film by blowing technique.<br>
