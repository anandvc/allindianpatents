				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   triaromatic   vitamin   d   analogues   and pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
The invention relates, as novel and useful industrial products, to triaromatic compounds which are vitamin D analogues.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing them and to their use in pharmaceutical compositions intended for use in human or veterinary medicine, or alternatively in cosmetic compositions.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have pronounced activity in the fields of cell proliferation and differentiation and find applications more particularly in the topical and systemic treatment of dermatological (or other) complaints associated with a keratinization disorder, complaints with an inflammatory and/or immunoallergic component and hyperproliferation of tissues of ectodermal origin (skin, epithelium, etc.), whether benign or malignant. These compounds can also be used to combat ageing of the skin, whether photo-induced or chronological, and to treat cicatrization disorders.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in cosmetic compositions for body and hair hygiene.<br>
Vitamin D is an essential vitamin for preventing and treating mineralization defects of cartilage (rickets) and of bone (osteomalacia), and even of certain forms of osteoporosis in elderly people. However, it is now accepted that its functions extend well beyond regulating bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Among these functions, mention may be made of its actions on cell proliferation and differentiation and the control of the immune defences. Their discovery has opened the way to novel therapeutic approaches in dermatology, carcinology and in the field of autoimmune diseases and that of organ or tissue transplants.<br>
An efficient therapeutic supply has long been confounded by the toxicity of this vitamin (occasionally fatal hypercalcaemia). Structural analogues of vitamin D are currently synthesized, some of which conserve only the differentiating properties and have no action on calcium metabolism.<br><br><br>
The Applicant has already oroposed, in patent application WO 01/38303, novel compounds that are vitamin D analogues, which show selective activity on cell proliferation and differentiation without having a hypercalcaemiant nature.<br>
The Applicant has just discovered, surprisingly, that certain compounds not specifically described in patent application WO 01/38303 show biological activity very much superior to that of the compounds specifically described. This activity is so strong that it is greater than or equal to the activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to compounds of general formula (I) below:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which:<br>
- X-Y represents a bond chosen from the following structures: -CH2-CHr -CHrO-<br>
-O-CH2--CH2-N(R4)-R* having the meanings given below,<br>
-	R, represents a methyl radical or an ethyl radical,<br>
-	R2 represents an ethyl radical, a propyl radical or an isopropyl radical,<br>
-	R3 represents an ethyl radical or a trifluoromethyl radical,<br>
-	RA represents a hydrogen atom, a methyl radical, an ethyl radical or a propyl<br>
radical,<br>
and aiso to the optical and geometrical isomers thereof, and the salts thereof. The present invention also relates to the compounds described above when they are in the form of salts of a mineral or organic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acic, fumaric acid, hemisuccinic acid, rnaleic acid and mandelic acid.<br>
Among the compounds of formula (I) falling within the context of the present invention, mention may be made especially of the following:<br>

According to the present invention, the compounds of formula (!) that are more particularly preferred are those for which at least one, and preferably all, of the conditions oelow are satisfied:<br>
(i) -X-Y represents -CH2-CH2-;<br>
(ii) RI   is an ethyl radical;<br>
(iii) R2 is a propyl radical;<br>
(iv) R3 is an ethyl radical.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also processes for preparing the compounds of formula (I) according to the reaction schemes presented in Figure 1.<br>
When -X-Y- represents a bond of structure -CH2-0- or -CH2-N(R4)-, the compounds of formula (la) are preferably prepared from compounds (1) and (2), obtained according to the reaction schemes of Figure 2.<br>
The compounds (1) (when Y = 0) and (2) may be obtained, respectively, from compounds (4) and (9), firstly by forming the trifluoromethanesulphonate derivatives ((5) and (10), respectively) in the presence of trifluoromelhanesulphonic anhydride and a base such as triethylamine in dichloromethane. Next, by means of a Suzuki coupling reaction with the boronic acid derivatives (6) in the presence of a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), the derivatives (7) and (11) are respectively obtained, followed by a coupling reaction with the bromo derivatives (8) in the presence of potassium carbonate in methyl ethyl ketone. When Y = NRA, compound (1) may be obtained from compound (12), firstly by a Suzuki coupling reaction with the boronic acid derivative (13) in the presence of a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), to give the derivative (14), followed by a coupling reaction with the bromo derivatives (8) in the presence of sodium hydride in dimethylformamide.<br>
When -X-Y- represents a bond of structure -CHrCH2-, the compounds of formula (la) snown in Figure 1 are prepared from the compounds (3), obtained according to the reaction scheme shown in Figure 3.<br>
Via a Suzuki reaction of the trifluoromethanesulphonate derivatives (5) with the boronic acid derivatives (15) in the presence of a catalyst such as tetra is(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tne compounds (16) are obtained. These compounds are converted into the compounds (18) by a Horner-Emmons reaction with compound (17), and then into the compounds (19) by protecting the ketone function in dioxolane form (ethylne glycol, para-toluenesulphonic acid, toluene). Reduction of the double bond in the presence of palladium-on-charcoal in a solvent such as methanol gives the compounds (3).<br>
Compound (6) may be obtained according to the reaction scheme of Figure 4. Compounds (8) and (17) may be obtained according to the reaction scheme of Figure 5. Compounds (12) and (13) may be obtained according to the reaction scheme of Figure 6. Compound (15) may be obtained according to the reaction scheme of Figure 7.<br>
When R3 represents a trifluoromethyl radical, the compounds (I) may be obtained from the corresponding bromo derivative by formation of the organomagnesium or organolithium derivative followed by reaction with hexafluoroacetone.<br>
The compounds according to the invention show biological properties analogous to those of vitamin D, especially properties of transactivation of the vitamin D response elements (VDRE), such as agonist or antagonist activity with respect to receptors of vitamin D or its derivatives. The expression "D vitamins or derivatives thereof means, for example, the derivatives of vitamin D2 or 03 and in particular 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 03 (calcitriol).<br>
This agonist activity with respect to receptors of vitamin D or of derivatives thereof may be demonstrated "in vitro" oy methods known in the field of study of gene transcription (Hansen et a/., The Society For Investigative Dermatology, vol.1, N°1, April 1996).<br>
The biological properties analogous to vitamin D may also be measured by means of the capacity of the product to induce the differentiation of promyelocytic leukaemia cells HL60, The protocol and also the results obtained with the compounds according to the invention are described in Example 8 of the present patent application.<br>
By way of example, the VDR agonist activity may be tested on the HeLa cell line by cotransfection of an expression vector of the human VDR receptor and of the reporter<br><br>
plasmid p240Hase-CAT. The agonist activity may also be characterized in this cotransfection system, by determininq the dose required to achieve 50% cf the maximum activity of the product (AC50). The details of the protocol for this test ana the results obtained with the compounds according to the invention are described ;n Example 9 of the present patent application.<br>
The biological properties analogous to vitamin D may also be measured by means of the capacity of the product to inhibit the proliferation of normal human keratinocyles (NHK in culture). The product is added to NHKs cultured under conditions promoting the proliferative state. The product is left in contact with the cells for five days. The number of proliferative cells is measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) into the DNA. The protocol for this test and the results obtained with the compounds according to the invention are described in Example 10 of the present patent application.<br>

EXAMPLE 8: Tests to evaluate the biological activity of the compounds of the invention - activity on the differentiation of HL60 cells<br>
Calcitrol   induces   the   differentiation   of   promyeiocytic   leukaemia   ceils   (HL60)   into<br>
monocyles/macrophages.   This   differentiation-inductive   effect   is   a   well-characterized<br>
marker of cellular    vitamin  D.  One of the  most important antimicrobial  products of<br>
macrophages  is  hydrogen  peroxide,  which   may be  analysed  experimentally  by  the<br>
reduction of NBT (Nitroblue Tetrazolium).<br>
The method used is as follows: the HL60 cells are inoculated into 6-well plates and tnen<br>
treated  immediately with a test compound.  After culturing for 4  days,  the cells are<br>
incubated with phorbol TPA ester and NBT for a short period and the differentiated cells,<br>
i.e. the ones that are positive to NBT, are counted.<br>
The differentiation-inductive effect on HL60 cells of the compounds according to the<br>
invention and also that of the reference compound, calcitriol, are given in Table I.<br>
The results show that the compounds of Examples 1 to 4 have differentiation-inducing<br>
activity on HL60 ceils similar to tnat of caicunol, the compound of Example 5 even having<br>
markedly superior activity.<br>
As regards the compound of Example 6, it shows less good activity compared with<br>
calcitriol, but nevertheless remains a very advantageous compound when compared with<br>
the compounds of the prior art.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9:  Tests to evaluate the biological activity of the  compounds of the invention - measurement of the VDR agonist activity (AC50 hVDR)<br>
The VDR agonist activity of the compounds of the invention may be tested on the HeLa cell line by cotransfection of the expression vector of the human VDR receptor and of the reporter plasmid p240Hase-CAT which contains the region -1399 to +76 of rat 24-hydroxylase promoter, cloned upstream of the coding phase of the chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. 18 hours after cotransfection, the test compound is added to the medium. After treatment for 18 hours, the CAT activity of the cell lysates is assayed by means of an ELISA test (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay, sold by Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The agonist activity may be characterized in this system of cotransfection Dy determining the dose required to achieve 50% of the maximum activity of the test compound (AC50).<br>
Tne measurement of the VDR agonisl activity of the compounds according to the invention and also that of the reference compound, calcitriol, are given in Table II. These results show that the compounds according to the present invention have activities that are comparable to that of calcitriol, the compound of Example 5 having, in this case also, superior activity.<br>
These results once again show that the compound of Example 6 shows less good activity compared with calcitriol, but nevertheless remains a very advantageous compound when compared with the compounds of the prior art. <br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
 EXAMPLE 10 : Tests to evaluate the biological activity of the compounds of the Invention - activity on the proliferation of human keratinocytes<br>
It is known that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, known as calcitriol and corresponding to natural<br>
vitamin D, inhibits the proliferation of human keratinocytes in culture.<br>
The method used is as follows: normal human keratinocytes are inoculated at low density<br>
into a 24-wel! plate. After 4 hours, the test compounds are added to the culture medium.<br>
After culturing  for 5  days,  the  proliferation  of the   keratinocytes  is  determined  by<br>
incorporating   5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine   (BrdU)   into   the   DNA.   The   amount   of   3rdU<br>
incorporated is then measured using the ELISA test (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent<br>
Assay, sold by Roche Molecular Biochemicals).<br>
The inhibitory effect on keratinocyte proliferation of the compounds according to the<br>
invention and of calcitriol used as reference compound is summarized in Table III.<br>
The IC50 value indicates the concentration of the test compound for which the compound<br>
inhibits the proliferation of the keratinocytes by 50%.<br>
These results make it possible to show that the compounds of the invention have<br>
inhibitory activity on keratinocyte proliferation in the same ranges of values as calcitriol;<br>
the compound of Example 5 is distinguished by an activity more than 5 times greater than<br>
that of calcitriol.<br>
As regards the compound of Example 6, it shows less good activity compared with<br>
calcitriol. but nevertheless remains a very advantageous compound when compared with<br>
the compounds of the prior art.<br><br>
