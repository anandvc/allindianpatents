DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for recovery of a<br>
cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound from a reaction mixture. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a solvent comprising a cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound and a process for its recovery. The<br>
present invention further relates to a solvent containing a cycloalkyl<br>
alkyl ether compound useful as a cleaning solvent for electronic<br>
parts, precision machinery components, and the like, a reaction<br>
solvent for various chemical reactions, an extraction solvent<br>
for extracting objective organic substances from various<br>
mixtures, a solvent or remover agent for electronic and electric<br>
materials, and the like, to a method tor cleaning articles, a<br>
method for reacting an organic metal, a Grignard reaction method,<br>
a method for extracting organic compounds, and a method for<br>
producing parts for electronic and electrical materials using<br>
the solvent, and to a process for advantageously producing the<br>
cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound in an industrial scale.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, a cleaning operation using a cleaning<br>
solvent is carried out during manufacturing electronic<br>
equipment, precision machines, and the like to prevent'<br>
degradation of electrical characteristics and mechanical<br>
1A<br><br>
characteristics. Chemically stable chlorine or flon solvents<br>
have been used for this purpose. The use of a number of these<br>
solvents has been regulated due to the problems in safety,<br>
toxicity, and environmental pollution.<br>
Cleaning solvents and cleaning compositions that are<br>
safe, less toxic, and less pollutant to the environment have<br>
been proposed as substitutes for these solvents. For example,<br>
cleaning solvents and cleaning compositions described in USP<br>
4,511,488, USP 4,640,719, USP 4,740,247, JP-A 3-62897, JP-A<br>
6-49495, and the like are given.<br>
However, these cleaning solvents- are not necessarily<br>
satisfactory in their detergency, particularly detergency for<br>
oils and fats. Therefore, development of a novel cleaning<br>
solvent excelling in both safety and detergency has been<br>
desired.<br>
Conventionally, ether solvents that are non-protonic and<br>
polar have widely been used as reaction solvents for various<br>
organic reactions (hereinafter referred to as "reaction") such<br>
as a Grignard reaction. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is a<br>
typical ether solvent, is a non-protonic and polar solvent<br>
having a moderate boiling point. THF is commonly used as a<br>
reaction solvent, particularly for Grignard reactions,<br>
reactions using an organolithium compound or the like, and other<br>
similar reactions. However, if THF is used as a solvent for<br>
a reaction mixture to which water is added, it is difficult to<br>
remove THF from the reaction mixture since i THF is mutually<br><br>
2<br><br>
soluble with water and forms an azeotrope. A special<br>
distillation process involving addition of an entrainer or<br>
other third components is required for industrially separating<br>
one component from another in an azeotrope. The distillation<br>
unit, which must be equipped with at least two columns and<br>
auxiliary equipment such as a decanter, can be operated only<br>
with difficulty requiring a high cost.<br>
When THF is used as a reaction solvent for Grignard<br>
reaction in which a Grignard reagent such as phenyl magnesium<br>
bromide (PhMgBr) is reacted with a ketone that can be easily<br>
enolated such as acetone, a self-aldol condensation reaction<br>
which is a side reaction is predominant over the target<br>
nucleophilic reaction, producing the target reaction product<br>
(, -dimethylbenzyl alcohol) only in a low yield. Therefore,<br>
development of a reaction solvent that can be easily recovered<br>
after use and exhibits excellent reaction selectivity has been<br>
desired.<br>
A solvent extraction is a well-known method for<br>
extracting a desired compound from a mixture using an<br>
appropriate extraction solvent. Various extraction solvents<br>
that can be used are known. Examples include halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and chloroform; aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as n-hexane and cyclohexane; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene; esters such as methyl<br>
acetate and ethyl acetate; ketones such as acetone and<br>
cyclohexanone; and ethers such as diethyl ether and dipropyl<br>
3<br><br>
ether.<br>
Requirements for the extraction solvents include (i)<br>
being inactive under the extraction conditions, (ii) being<br>
capable of sufficiently dissolving extracted substances, (iii)<br>
having an appropriate boiling point, producing vapor that has<br>
a minimal risk of being absorbed during the solvent extraction<br>
operation, and being easily evaporated, and (iv) having only<br>
a slight possibility of polluting the environment.<br>
However, only a few extraction solvents currently<br>
available satisfy these requirements. For example, since<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and<br>
chloroform having excellent capability of dissolving various<br>
organic compounds have a strong toxicity and a low boiling point,<br>
their vapor have a risk of being inhaled during the extraction<br>
operation and cause an environmental pollution problem.<br>
Esters such as ethyl acetate and aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
toluene are also extraction solvents with wide versatility, but<br>
exhibit only limited capability of dissolving organic compounds<br>
having a moderate polarity and insufficient extraction<br>
efficiency. Therefore, development of a novel extraction<br>
solvent advantageous fron the viewpoint of extraction operation<br>
and environmental safety has been desired.<br>
Conventionally, various organic solvents such as<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
solvents,and haiogenated hydrocarbon solvents have been used<br>
as a solvent and parting agents for electronic materials,<br>
4<br><br>
electrical materials, and the like. It is desirable that these<br>
solvents and parting agents exhibit high solubility and<br>
dispersibility of electronic and electrical materials and are<br>
safe and free from the problem of environmental pollution.<br>
However, not a few currently available solvents and<br>
parting agents lack solubility and dispersibility of electronic<br>
and electrical materials, are strongly toxic, and pollute the<br>
environment. Therefore, development of a solvent and parting<br>
agent exhibiting high solubility and dispersibility of<br>
electronic and electrical materials and being safe and free from<br>
the problem of environmental pollution has been desired.<br>
As the method for producing ethers by the addition<br>
reaction of an olefin to an alcohol, a method of using<br>
crystalline alumino silicate as a catalyst (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-open No. 59-25345), a method of using HZSM-5<br>
zeolite as a catalyst USP No. 4,306,100), a method of using<br>
special alumino silicate having many acid points on the surface<br>
as a catalyst (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.<br>
61-249945), a method of using tungsten oxide in which the<br>
crystal water possessed by a heteropoly acid has been adjusted<br>
ZQ about 3.0 or less molecules per one molecules of the<br>
heteropolyacid as a catalyst (Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-open No. 5-163188), and the like are known.<br>
However, the activity of the catalysts used in these<br>
methods has been insufficient to manufacture the target<br>
compound at an industrially acceptable selectivity and<br>
5<br><br>
conversion rate, particularly to manufacture a cycloalkyl alkyl<br>
ether compound from an alicyclic olefin as a starting raw<br>
material.<br>
A method of using an acidic ion-exchange resin is an old<br>
method for producing ethers by the addition, reaction of en<br>
olefin to an alcohol. However, the method involves problems<br>
such as isomerization of olefins as a side reaction and thermal<br>
instability of used resins if conventional acidic ion-exchange<br>
resins are used as described in Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-open No. 5--163188, for example.<br>
The present invention has been achieved in view of this<br>
situation. A first object of the present invention is therefore<br>
to provide (a) a novel cleaning solvent that can be safely<br>
handled, can be mixed with many organic solvents and dissolve<br>
various pollutant organic substances such as fats and oils,<br>
waxes, and natural resins, and can be promptly decomposed in<br>
the atmosphere without adversely affecting the ozone layer, (b)<br>
a reaction solvent that can be easily recovered after use and<br>
exhibits excellent reaction selectivity, (c) an extraction<br>
solvent advantageous from the viewpoint of operational<br>
sificiency and environmental safety, (d) a solvent for<br>
electronic and electrical materials exhibiting high solubility<br>
and dispersibility of the materials and being safe and free from<br>
the problem of environmental pollution, and (e) a solvent usable<br>

from an OPC (Organic Photo Conductor) drum or for removing<br>
6<br><br>
semiconductor materials and the like glued to jigs with an<br>
adhesive from the adhesive or the jig.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an industrially advantageous process for producing a cycloalkyl<br>
alkyl ether compound useful as such a cleaning solvent, reaction<br>
solvent, extraction solvent, parting agent for electronic or<br>
electrical materials.<br>

as that possessed by the group R1 (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"cyclopentenes") or a cyclohexene which may have a substituent<br>

14<br><br>
mol of the cyclopentyl alcohol or cyclohexyl alcohol.<br>
The method (a) can be carried out either without using<br>
a solvent or using an inert solvent. The reaction in the<br>
presence of an inert solvent is more preferable. A non-protonic<br>
polar solvent is preferably used.<br>
Either commercially available cyclopentyl alcohols and<br>
cyclohexyl alcohols or those produced by a known method can be<br>
used as the raw materials.<br>
The alkylation reaction can be carried out by a method<br>
of suspending or dissolving a prescribed amount of a base to<br>
an inert solvent, adding a cyclopentyl alcohol or cyclohexyl<br>

In these instances, after adding the base and before<br>
adding the alkylating agent, it is preferable to form a<br>
cyclopentyl alcohol or cyclohexyl alcohol salt by stirring and<br>

Of these, from the viewpoint of easy availability and<br>
easy handling, a sulfonic acid-type strong acid cation exchange<br>
resin comprising a sulfonic acid group as the ion-exchange group<br>
is preferable, with a sulfonic acid-type styrene strong acid<br>
cation exchange resin comprising a copolymer of styrene or<br>
halogenated styrene and divinyl benzene as the polymer<br>
substrate and a sulfonic acid group as the ion-exchange group<br>
being particularly preferable.<br>
The apparent density(g/L-R) of the acidic ion-exchange<br>
resin is usually 500-1, 000, and preferably 600-900. The water<br>
content before drying is usually 30-70 wt%. There are no<br>
spscific limitations to the average particular size of the acidic<br>

the range of 0.02-10 mm, and preferably 0.5-2 mm. Usually, a<br>
common proton-type acidic ion-exchange resin is used and can<br>

Of these acidic ion-exchange resins, the acidic<br>
ion-exchange resins comprising water in an amount of 5 wt% or<br>

containing water in an amount of 5 wt% or less as a reaction<br>
catalyst.<br>
To obtain the acidic ion-exchange resin comprising water	<br>
in an amount of 5 wt% or less, the resin is dried before use<br>
to remove the water. There are no specific restrictions to the<br>
method for drying the acidic ion-exchange resin as long as the<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin comprising 5 wt% or less of water<br>

which the inert gas is circulated. The hourly space velocity<br>

When an acidic ion-exchange resin comprising 5 wt% or<br>
less of water is used, an ether compound can be produced by<br>
contacting an alicyclic olefin other than the above-mentioned<br>
cyclopentene (cyclohexene) with the compound shown by the<br>
formula R'.OH<br>
As examples of the alicyclic olefin, an aliphatic<br>
compound having a monocyclic or polycyclic structure with 3-20<br>
carbon atoms and having at least one carbon-carbon double bond<br>
in the cyclic skeleton, excluding cyciopentenes and<br>
cyclohexenes, can be given. Furthermore, alicyclic olefins<br>
comprising substituents such as an alkyl group, aryl group,<br>
halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, alkoxy group, sulfone<br>
group, and cyano group on the cyclic skeleton may be used. As<br>
examples of other alicyclic olefins, seven-membered cyclic<br>
compounds such as cycloheptene, 1-mcthyl cycloheptene, and<br>
1-phenyl cycloheptene; and eight-membered cyclic compounds<br>
such as cyclooctene, 1-methyl cyclooctene, and 1-phenyl<br>
cyclooctene can be given.<br>
There are no specific limitations to the method for<br>
contacting the cyciopentenes (cyclohexenes) with the compound<br>
20<br><br>
of the formula R' OH in the presence of the acidic ion-exchange<br>
resin. As examples of this method, a method of adding the acidic<br>
ion-exchange resin to a mixture of cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes)<br>
and the compound of the formula R' OH (hereinafter, also referred<br>
to as "mixture") while stirring (batch type) and a method<br>
comprising filling a column with the acidic ion-exchange resin<br>
and flowing the mixture through the column (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "reaction column") (flow type) can be given. Of<br>
these, from the viewpoint of efficient and continuous<br>
purification of the reaction product, use of the flow type is<br>
preferable<br>
In the production of the above-mentioned mixture, the<br>
cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes) and the compound shown by the<br>
formula R'OH are mixed at a predetermined ratio. In this<br>
instance, the mixture comprising cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes)<br>
and the compound of the formula R' OH can be prepared beforehand,<br>
stored in a tank, and sent to the column in a gaseous or liquid<br>
state, or cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes) and the compound shown<br>
by the formula R'OH can be stored in separate tanks, sent to<br>
the column separately in a liquid state, and mixed immediately<br>
before entering the column. The mixture preferably contains<br>
as little water as possible to ensure efficient production of<br>
the target product. The mixture preferably contains water in<br>
an amount of 1 wt% or less, with 500 ppm or less being<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
In the batch-type, the acidic ion-exchange resin,<br>
21<br><br>
cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes), and the compound shown by the<br>
formula R'OH are added to the reactor in predetermined amounts<br>
and the reaction mixture is stirred at a predetermined<br>
temperature and pressure. In this instance, the acidic<br>
ion-exchange resin is usually used in an amount of 0.01-200<br>
parts by weight, preferably 0.1-150 parts by weight, and<br>
particularly preferably 1-100 parts by weight for 100 parts by<br>
weight of cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes).<br>
In the batch-type, even though there are no specific<br>
limitations to the proportion of cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes)<br>
and the compound shown by the formula R'OH, the compound shown<br>
by the formula R'OH is preferably used in an excessive<br>
proportion. Since the mixture is heated for a long period of<br>
time in the batch-type, a polymer of cyclopentenes<br>
(cyclohexenes) may be produced if an excessive amount of<br>
cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes) is used. The proportion of<br>
cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes) and the compound shown by the<br>
formula R'OH (the mol ratio of (cyclopentenes<br>
(cyclohexenes) / (compound shown by the formula R' OH) ) is usually<br>
1/1-1/50, preferably 1/1-1/30, and particularly preferably<br>
1/1 -1/20 .<br>
When the flow-type is used, the mixture is flowed through<br>
the reaction column. In this instance, the column possessing<br>
a heating apparatus is used and the mixture is flowed through<br>
the reaction column heated to the prescribed temperature<br>
(reaction temperature) . Even though the mixture may be flowed<br>
22<br><br>
through the reaction column in a liquid or gaseous state, the<br>
mixture is preferably flowed through the reaction column in a<br>
gaseous state to obtain high selectivity and a high conversion<br>
rate of the target product.<br>
When the mixture is flowed through the reaction column<br>
in a gaseous state, a gaseous phase-solid phase reaction occurs.<br>
As an example of a method for conducting this reaction, as shown<br>
in figure 1 (a), a method wherein the mixture liquid exits from<br>
the mixture liquid storage tank la, is transformed into a gas<br>
by the heat/gasification device 2a, and enters the reaction<br>
column 3a in a gaseous state can be given. When several reaction<br>
columns are used, the pipes connecting the reaction columns,<br>
in addition to the reaction columns, are preferably maintained<br>
at the prescribed temperature.<br>
As specific examples of the flow-type, a method of using<br>
a reaction column 3a packed with the acidic ion-exchange resin<br>
as shown in figure 1 (a) , a method of using a plurality of reaction<br>
columns 3b and 3c packed with the acidic ion-exchange resin and<br>
connected in series as shown in figure 2(b), and a method of<br>
using a plurality of reaction columns 3d, 3e, and 3f connected<br>
in series and in parallel as shown in figure l(c) can be given.<br>
When several columns are used in combination, the conversion<br>
rate of cyclopentenes [(cyclohexenes) or the compound of the<br>
formula R'OH] can be improved.<br>
There are no specific limitations to the size of the<br>
columns used. The size may be selected in accordance with the<br>
23<br><br>
scale of the reaction. When a combination of several reaction<br>
columns is used, the type of the acidic ion-exchange resin<br>
packed in each of the columns may be the same or different.<br>
As the method for flowing the mixture through the react on<br>
columns packed with the acidic ion-exchange resin, a down flew-<br>
type wherein the mixture is flowed from the top of the reaction<br>
columns 3b and 3c as shown in figure 1(b) or an up flow-type<br>
wherein the mixture is flowed from the bottom of the reaction<br>
columns 3b and 3c as shown in fig 2 can be used. From the<br>
viewpoint of high conversion rate and selectivity of the target<br>
product, the down flow-type is preferable.<br>
The mixture passes through the reaction column usually<br>
at a pressure of 30 MPa above the atmospheric pressure, with<br>
10 MPa above the atmospheric pressure being preferable and 5MPa<br>
above the atmospheric pressure being particularly preferable.<br>
When the flow-type is used, the space velocity of the liquid<br>
mixture (LHSV) is usually 0.01-100 hr-1, and preferably 0.1-20<br>
hr-1, and that of the gaseous state mixture (GHSV) is usually<br>
0.01-40,000 hr-1, and preferably 0.1-8,000 hr-1. When several<br>
reaction columns are used, the reaction temperature, flow speed,<br>
and the like may be different, for each reaction column.<br>
In the flow-type, even though there are no specific<br>
limitations to the proportion of the cyclopentenes<br>
(cyclohexenes) and the compound of the formula R'OH, the<br>
cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes) is preferably used in an excessive<br>
amount. Since the mixture is heated for only a short period<br>
24<br><br>
of time in the flow-type, polymerization of the cyclopentenes<br>
(cyclohexenes) does not occur, on the other hand, the amount<br>
of dialkyl ether by-products increases when the compound of the<br>
formula R'OH is used in an excessive amount. The proportion<br>
of the cyclopcntenes (cyclohexenes) and the compound of the<br>
formula R'OH (the mol ratio of (cyclopentenes<br>
(cyclohexenes)/(compound of the formula R'OH)) is usually<br>
1/3-20/1, preferably 1/3-10/1, more preferably 1/3-5/1, and<br>
particularly preferably 1/3-3/1.<br>
After the reaction, the targeted cycloalkyl alkyl ether<br>
compound can be isolated from the reaction liquid by using<br>
common isolation and purification methods such as solvent<br>
extraction and distillation. Distillation may be conducted<br>
several times. Distillation devices known in the art such as<br>
a continuous rectification device comprising a rectification<br>
column can be used. It is also possible, as shown in Figure<br>
3, to circulate the mixture through a reaction column 3g packed<br>
with an acidic ion-exchange resin, cause the resulting reaction<br>
mixture to pass through a reaction column 3h, and continuously<br>
distill the mixture using a distillation apparatus 4 packed with<br>
Rashich rings. In this method, the unrcacted alicyclic olefin<br>
and alcohol can be returned to the reaction column 3g by the<br>
pipe 5 and reacted once again to obtain a high conversion rate<br>
of the target product.<br>
In the above production method (b), a solid acid in<br>
crystalline form (crystalline solid acid) may be used as the<br>
25<br><br>
solid acid. The crystalline solid acid is a general term for<br>
acidic inorganic substances in which silicon, phosphorus,<br>
aluminum oxide, and the like form specific chemical<br>
constitution unit and form unit with regularity and includes<br>
naturally occurring zeolite, synthetic zeolite, and the like.<br>
Acidic or neutral zeolites are preferable as the crystalline<br>

molecular sieve 4A, and molecular sieve 5A; and metallo alumino<br>
silicate or metallo silicate containing hetero atoms such as<br>
boron, iron, gallium, titanium, copper, or silver can be given.<br>
In addition, Si-substituted aluminum phosphate zeolite (SAPO)<br>
having a a phosphoric acid skeleton can also be used. Either<br>
commercially available products or products produced by a known<br>
method may be used.<br>
Although zeolites with a proton type cationic moiety are<br>
usually used, those with a cationic moiety replaced with at<br>
least one of the elements selected fromthe group consisting<br>
of alkaline earth metals such as Mg, Ca, and Sr, rare earth<br>
elements such as La and Ce, and elements in the groups 8-10 in<br>
the periodic table such as Fe, Co, Ni , Ru, Pd, and Pt, or those<br>
containing Ti, Zr, Hf, Cr, Mo, W, Th, or the like can also be<br>
used.<br>
26<br><br>
Various types of zeolite, can be appropriately selected<br>
according to the molecular size of the cycloalkyl alkyl ether<br>
compounds to be produced. Of these various types of zeolite,<br>
molecular sieve 3A, molecular sieve 4A, molecular sieve 5A,<br>
H-raordenite, Ka-mordenite, ZSM-5, and the like are preferable.<br>
H-mordenite, Na-mordenite, ZSM-5, and the like are more<br>
preferable, with the H-type zeolite having a penta-sil<br>
structure being still more preferable, and ZSM-series zeolite<br>
being particularly preferable. The pore diameter of zeolite<br>
used is usually 2-12 A, and preferably 2-10 A. Although there<br>
are no specific limitations to the composition of zeolite, those<br>
having silica/alumina molar ratio of 10 or more are preferable,<br>
with those having silica/alumina molar ratio of 20 or more being<br>
still more preferable.<br>
There are no specific limitations to the form of the<br>
crystalline solid acid. Any crystalline solid acid in the form<br>
of powder, particles, or formed solid acids may be used.<br>
Primary particles in powdery crystalline solid acid has a<br>
diameter preferably or 1 m or less. The primary particles may<br>
be independently present or may be present as secondary<br>
aggregates. The particle cr formed solid acids may have a<br>
spherical, disk-like, column-like, or cylindrical outward<br>
configuration. The average particle size of the particle or<br>
formed solid acids is not specifically limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected from the range usually of 1-40 mm, and<br>
preferably of 2-20 mm. The specific surface area can be<br>
27<br><br>
appropriately selected from the range usually of 1-100 m2/g<br>

The crystalline solid acid is usually used in an amount<br>
of 0. 001-200 parts by weight, preferably 0.1-200 parts by weight,<br>
and more preferably 1.0-150 parts by weight for 100 parts by<br>
weight of the cyclopentenes (cyclohexenes).<br>
Any reactors commonly used in the industry such as a fluid<br>
bed-type reactor, a batch-type reactor, and a fixed-bed<br>
flow-type reactor can be applied to using crystalline solid acid.<br>
In the case of a batch-type reactor, any conventionally known<br>
stirrer such as a vibration-type and rotation-type can be used<br>
for stirring the mixture inside the reactor. The number of<br>
vibration, number of rotation, and stirring rate can be<br>
appropriately determined. In the case of the fixed-bed<br>
flow-type reactor, a. formed catalyst manufactured by extrusion<br>
molding or compression molding is preferably used. The LHSV<br>
(Liquid Hourly Space Velocity) is usually in the range of<br>
0,1-5.0 h-1, and preferably 0.5-3.0 h-1.<br>
The above production method (b) may be carried out without<br>
using a solvent or using an inert solvent that does not mix with<br>
water, in which case the raw material cyclopentene compounds<br>
or cyclohexene compounds are diluted with the inert solvent.<br>

alkoxy-substituted cyclooctane, and nitro-substituted<br>
cyclooctane; nitrogen, argon, air, and helium can be given. The<br>
amount of the diluent used can be selected without any<br>
particular limitations as long as the reaction is not hindered.<br>
The solvent is used in an amount of usually 10-90 vol% and<br>
preferably 20-80 vol% of the total amount of the reaction<br>
liquid.<br>
(C) Solvent containing cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound<br>
The solvent of the present invention comprises at least<br>
one type of cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound. The cycloalkyl<br>
alkyl ether compound is included in an amount of usually 30 wt%<br>
or more, and preferably 50 wt% or more of the total amount of<br>
the solvent..<br>
The solvent of the present invention may comprise one<br>
or more types of other liquid organic compounds in addition to<br>
the cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound. As examples of the other<br>
liquid organic compound, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, and<br>
29<br><br>
n-decane; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane,<br>

esters such as formate and acetate; nitriles such as<br>
acetonitrile; amides such as N,N-dimethyl formamide,<br>
N,N-dimethyl acetoamide, hexamethyl phosphoric acid triamide,<br>
and N-methyl pyrrolidone; organic nitrogen compounds such as<br>

The other liquid organic compounds are included in an<br>
amount of usually 30 wt% or less, preferably 10 wt% or less,<br>
and particularly preferably 5 wt% or less of the total amount<br>
of the solvent.<br>
The solvent of the present invention contains water<br>
30<br><br>
preferably in an amount of 100 ppm or less, with 60 ppm or less<br>
being even more preferable, and 30 ppm or less being<br>
particularly preferable. If the water content of the solvent<br>
exceeds 100 ppm, the reaction may not produce the target yield<br>
when the solvent of the present invention is used in a reaction<br>
in which an organic metal is used. For example, in the Grignard<br>
reaction for producing a Grignard reagent shown by the formula<br>
RaMgXa (wherein Ra is an alkyl group and Xa is a halogen atom),<br>
the Grignard reagent is not produced at a sufficient yield if<br>
water is present in a large amount. Since the Grignard reagent<br>
produced easily reacts with water, the Grignard reagent in an<br>
amount equivalent to the water remaining in the solvent is<br>
consumed by the reaction with the water, thereby lowering the<br>
reaction yield.<br>
 In one of the methods for reducing the water content of<br>
the solvent to 100 ppm or less, the solvent of the present-<br>
invention prior to drying is caused to come in contact with a<br>
dehydrating agent.<br>
As the dehydrating agent, those known in the art that<br>
 are stable when used in combination with a cycloalkyl alkyl<br>
ether compound may be used without any particular limitations.<br>
As specific examples of the dehydrating agent, adsorptive<br>
porous substances such as molecular sieve (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated as "MS"), activated alumina and silica gel, and<br>
 salts possessing neutral or near neutral absorption properties<br>
such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate, anhydrous sodium sulfate,<br>
31<br><br>
and calcium chloride can be given. Of these, MS, calcium<br>
chloride, and anhydrous magnesium sulfate capable of<br>
effectively dehydrating in a short period of time are preferable,<br>
with MS being particularly preferable.<br>
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is given as a typical solvent that<br>
has been conventionally used with Grignard reactions.<br>
According to the investigation of the present inventors,<br>
lowering- the water content of THF below 250 ppm is difficult<br>
when THF is contacted with MS or the like as the dehydrating<br>
agent on an industrial scale. On the other hand, if the solvent<br>
of the present invention is caused to come in contact with MS<br>
or the like as the dehydrating agent, the water content is easily<br>
reduced to 30 ppm or less. Therefore, by using the solvent of<br>
the present invention as a reaction solvent in a Grignard<br>
reaction or an organic metal reaction, a high reaction yield<br>
can be achieved in comparison to using THF.<br>
There are no specific limitations to the method of<br>
contacting the solvent of the present invention with the<br>
dehydrating agent. For example, a flow-type comprising using<br>
a column packed with a dehydrating agent such as MS and causing<br>
the solvent of the present invention to passed through the<br>
column, or a batch-type comprising placing the solvent of the<br>
present invention and the dehydrating agent in a reactor<br>
equipped with a stirrer and stirring the mixture to cause the<br>
solvent and the dehydrating agent to come into contact can be<br>
given. The water content of the solvent of the present<br>
32<br><br>
invention can be analyzed using Karl-Fischer coulometric<br>
titration.<br>
The solvent of the present invention preferably<br>
comprises an antioxidant. If the antioxidant is added, the<br>
peroxide content of the solvent can be maintained below 100 ppm,<br>
even if the solvent is stored for a long period of time or<br>
repeatedly distilled for recovery. When the solvent of the<br>
present invention is used as a cleaning solvent, the solvent<br>
is used for a long period of time at a high temperature of 90°C<br>
or more to achieve an increased cleaning effect or repeatedly<br>
distilled for recovery. Adding an antioxidant can prevent an<br>
increase in the peroxide content in the cleaning solvent. In<br>
other words, a cleaning solvent possessing excellent cleaning<br>
effect and stability can be obtained by the combination of at<br>
least one type of cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound and an<br>
antioxidant.<br>
The amount of the antioxidant can be selected from a wide<br>
range depending on the conditions of use. However, from the<br>
viewpoint of stability, cleaning power, and cost, the<br>
antioxidant is preferably used in an amount of 0.0005-5 wt% of<br>
the total amount of the solvent.<br>
As examples of the antioxidant, phenols, aromatic amines,<br>
and phosphorous acid esters can be given, with phenols being<br>
preferable from the viewpoints of antioxidation effect and<br>
cost.<br>
The phenols is an essential component for the solvent<br>
33<br><br>
of the present invention for preventing deterioration and<br>
soiling during processing at a high temperature such as heating,<br>
distillation, and recovery. A specific phenol compound is<br>
selected from those capable of suppressing production of<br>
peroxides without adversely affecting the solvent.<br>
As specific examples of the phenols,<br>
2,6-di-t-butyl-pr-cresol, timor, pyrocatechin,<br>
4-methoxyphenol, n-propyl gallate, and 2-t-butylhydroquinone<br>
can be given. Of these, 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol is<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
The. solvent of the present invention may also contain<br>
other components in addition to the cycloalkyl alkyl ether<br>
compound and the above-mentioned other liquid organic compounds .<br>

 accordance with the application such as cleaning solvent,<br>
reaction solvent, extraction solvent, and electronic and<br>
electrical solvent.<br>

solvent of the present invention is usually conducted at a<br>
reaction temperature from -100°C to the boiling point of the<br>
solvent.<br>
The reaction solvent of the present invention excels in<br>
reaction selectivity. For example, if a Grignard reagent is<br>
reacted with a ketone that can be easily enolized using other<br>
ether solvent such as THF, a self-aldol reaction predominates.<br>
However, the target alcohol can be obtained in a high yield by<br>

The cycloalkyl alkyl ather compound possesses a very low<br>
miscibility with water. Even though this compound produces an<br>
azeotrope with water, the compound can be easily separated from<br>
the water. Therefore, after conducting the reaction using the<br>
reaction solvent of the present invention, the reaction solvent<br>
can be conveniently and efficiently recovered from the reaction<br>
42<br><br>
mixture. The target reaction solvent can be easily isolated<br>
from the reaction mixture, for example, by adding water (or an<br>
aqueous acid solution) to the reaction mixture using the<br>
reaction solvent of the present invention to terminate the<br>
reaction, separating the reaction mixture into a water layer<br>
and an organic layer, removing the reaction solvent from the<br>
organic layer, and purifying the residue using a known method<br>
such as distillation and column chromatography.<br>
Furthermore, since the reaction solvent of the present<br>
invention has a moderate boiling point, the reaction solvent<br>
can be efficiently recovered from the reaction mixture. The<br>
recovered reaction solvent is purified, as required, and can<br>
be reused as a reaction solvent.<br>
(F) Extraction Solvent<br>
The cycloalkyl alkyl ether compounds of the above<br>
formulas (1), (2), or (3) exhibit excellent solubility to a<br>
variety of chemicals and are chemically stable with various<br>
reactive substances. Therefore, the solvent of the present<br>
invention is also useful as an extraction solvent for extracting<br>
organic compounds from a solid or liquid mixture containing the<br>
organic compounds.<br>
The content of the cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound in<br>
the extraction solvent of the present invention is usually 70<br>
wt% or more, preferably 90 wt% or more, and still more preferably<br>
95 wt% or more.<br>
There are no specific limitations to the extracted<br>
43<br><br>
organic compounds inasmuch as such compounds can be dissolved<br>
in the cycloalkyl alkyl ether compound. From the viewpoint that<br>
the extraction solvent of the present invention functions as<br>
a substitute for conventional extraction solvents, organic<br>
compounds exhibiting excellent solubility in conventional<br>
extraction solvents such as aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons,<br>
esters, and aromatic hydrocarbons are preferable.<br>
Organic compounds having a polar group in the molecule<br>
can be given as such organic compounds. The polar group here<br>
indicates a group containing atoms having electronegativity<br>
different from that of the carbon atom such as an oxygen atom,<br>
nitrogen atom, and sulfur atom. As examples of the polar group,<br>
an amide group, carboxyl group, ester group, hydroxyl group,<br>
carbonyl group, amino group, nitro group, cyano group, alkoxy<br>
group, mercapto group, and alkylthio group can be given.<br>
As examples of the organic compound having a polar group<br>
in the molecule, naturally occurring substances, active<br>
ingredients of medical supplies and agricultural chemicals,<br>
industrial chemicals, perfumes, intermediates for<br>
manufacturing these substances, and the like having one or more<br>
polar groups in the molecule can be given. Although there are<br>
no specific limitations, the molecular weight of these organic<br>
compounds is usually 100-500, and preferably 100-300.<br>
In the case where the organic compound to be extracted<br>
has an asymmetrical carbon atom in the molecule, such an organic<br>
compound may be either a mixture of optical isomers or one of<br>
44<br><br>
the optical isomers. No racemization reaction occurs during<br>
the extraction operation.<br>
As a method of solvent extraction, liquid-liquid<br>
extraction for extracting an organic compound from a solution<br>
that comprises adding an extraction solvent immiscible with the<br>
solvent of the organic compound solution to cause the organic<br>
compound to move to the extraction solvent by utilization of<br>
the difference in the distribution coefficient, solid-liquid<br>
extraction that comprises adding the extraction solvent to a<br>
solid mixture containing the organic compound to cause the<br>
organic compound to be extracted in the solvent, and.the like<br>
can be given. The extraction solvent of the present invention<br>
is particularly useful for extracting an organic compound from<br>
an aqueous solution of the organic compound, since, the<br>
extraction solvent dissolves with water only very slightly and<br>
can be easily separated from water.<br>
More specifically, the liquid-liquid extraction<br>
includes (i) a method of adding the extraction solvent of the<br>
present invention to an aqueous solution of an organic compound<br>
of which the solubility in the extraction solvent is higher than<br>
that in water, sufficiently shaking the mixture, allowing the<br>
mixture to stand still to be separated into a water layer and<br>
an organic layer, and to remove the organic layer, (ii) a method<br>
for extracting a salt of an acidic organic compound such as<br>
carboxylic acid or a salt of a basic organic compound from an<br>
aqueous solution comprising adding an acid (in the case of the<br>
45<br><br>
salt of an acidic, compound) to liberate the acidic compound or<br>
a base (in the case of the salt of a basic compound) to liberate<br>
the basic compound and extracting the liberated acidic organic<br>
compound or basic organic compound using the extraction solvent<br>
or the present invention, and the like. In this instance, the<br>
extraction operation can be repeated several times. The<br>
extraction temperature is usually -20 to 100°C, preferably<br>
0-90°C, and still more preferably 20-50°C.<br>
 The liquid-liquid extraction is carried out using a<br>
separating funnel in experiments in laboratories. When a large-<br>
quantity of materials are processed, a known separating<br>
apparatus (a mixer settler), a multiple mixer decanter type<br>
contactor, a gravity fractionation column type contactor, and<br>
the like can be used.<br>
When a separating funnel is used, an appropriate amount<br>
of the extraction solvent of the present invention is added to<br>
the aqueous solution containing the target compound to be<br>
extracted and the mixture is sufficiently shaken. Then, the<br>
mixture is allowed to stand to completely separate into two<br>
layers, an organic layer and a water layer, and the organic layer<br>
is removed.<br>
A known separating apparatus (mixer settler), which is<br>
a large' scale separating funnel, can be operated according to<br>
the method of operating an experimental-scale separating<br>
funnel.<br>
The multiple mixer decanter type contactor is a<br>
46<br><br>
non-agitating type extractor that is typically operated by<br>
charging a light liquid with a small specific gravity (the<br>
extraction solvent of the present invention) from the bottom<br>
of the extractor and a heavy liquid with a large specific gravity<br>
(an aqueous solution, etc.) from the top. Since the light<br>
liquid flows upwardly and the heavy liquid flows downwardly in<br>
the apparatus, the two liquids contact in the column. The<br>
components dissolved in the light liquid and the heavy liquid<br>
are distributed to each liquid layer according to the<br>
distribution coefficient. In this instance, if multi stage<br>
porous plates are installed in the extraction column, the light<br>
liquid ascends the column as droplets through pores in the<br>
porous plates and the drops come into contact with the heavy<br>
liquid. A large number of droplets further ascend the column<br>
through pores in the porous plates. The two liquids efficiently<br>
contact each other by repeating the formation and association<br>
of droplets in this manner.<br>
The gravity fractionation column type contactor is an<br>
extractor in which stirring is mechanically performed. As the<br>
method for stirring, a method of using stirring blades, a method<br>
of vibrating by pulse, and the like can be given.<br>
As a specific example of the solid-liquid extraction,<br>
a method of sufficiently mixing the solid containing the organic<br>
compound to be extracted with the extraction solvent of the<br>
present invention, extracting the target organic compound, and<br>
removing insoluble matters by filtration or the like can be<br>
47<br><br>
given. The solid mixture may be finely pulverized before<br>
extraction to increase the extraction efficiency. The<br>
extraction solvent may be heated during the extraction.<br>
As the extraction apparatus used for the solid-liquid<br>
extraction, known extractors such as an extractor of the type<br>
having a cloth filter or a porous plate installed in the bottom<br>
can be used. The solid containing the organic compound to be<br>
extracted is placed on the cloth filter or porous plate and the<br>
extraction solvent is circulated through the extractor. When<br>
a large quantity of materials is processed by solid-liquid<br>
extraction, a continuous extractor described in Published<br>
Japanese Translation of PCT Application 9-510913, for example,<br>
can be used.<br>
In any apparatus, the extraction solvent phase is removed<br>
and dried, as required, following which the extraction solvent<br>
is evaporated. The resulting residue is purified by a known<br>
purification means such as. washing with a solvent,<br>
recrystallization, column chromatography, and distillation to<br>
isolate the target product. When the extract is a thermally<br>
unstable compound such as a natural product, a means such as<br>
a method oi removing extraction solvent under reduced pressure,<br>
a method of decreasing partial pressure of the solvent by<br>
injecting steam (steam stripping), or the like is necessary.<br>
The extraction solvent used for the extraction is<br>
recovered by a solvent recovery apparatus, purified by<br>
distillation or the like, as required, and again used as the<br>
48<br><br>
extraction solvent.<br>
(G) Solvent for electronic and electrical materials<br>
The cycloalkyl alkyl ether compounds of the above<br>
formulas (1), (2), or (3) can exhibit excellent solubility to<br>
electronic and electrical materials, exhibit only slight<br>
toxicity, and are almost free from the problem of environmental<br>
pollution. Therefore, the solvent of the present invention is<br>
also useful as a solvent for electronic and electrical<br>
materials.<br>
When the solvent of the present invention is used as a<br>
solvent for electronic and electrical-materials, other liquid<br>
organic compounds such as alcohol- solvents, ether solvents,<br>

(H) Parting agent<br>
The cycloalkyl alkyl ether compounds of the above<br>
formulas (1)., (2), or (3) can exhibit excellent solubility to<br>
photosensitizers,. organic adhesives, photosensitive resists,<br>
and organic insulating materials, exhibit only slight toxicity,<br>
and are almost free from the problem of environmental pollution.<br>
Therefore, the solvent of the present invention is also useful<br>
as a parting agent. Specific examples include (a) a parting<br>
agent for removing a photosensitive layer from a photosensitive<br>
drum and (b) a parting agent that can be used for removing<br>
adhesive parts from jigs for fabrication in the case when<br>
semiconductor materials, crystal materials, electronic part<br>
materials, magnetic materials, piezo materials, and the like<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "adhered materials") are caused to<br>
adhere to jigs and are processed by cutting, grinding, or the<br>
like.<br>
In the case of manufacturing OPC drums by forming a<br>
photosensitive layer on a photosensitive drum, if the thickness<br>
of the photosensitive layer is not uniform, defective goods with<br>
57<br><br>
an impaired image are produced due to uneven charge conditions.<br>

the drum and a new photosensitive layer must.be formed. In this<br>
instance (in the case of (a) ) , the photosensitive layer can be<br>
easily parted from the drum by dipping the defective OFC drum<br>
in the solvent of the present invention and removing it<br>
therefrom.<br>
In the case of (b), the adhered materials attached to<br>
the jigs using an organic adhesive can be easily parted by<br>
dipping the adhered materials in the solvent of the present<br>
invention and then removing therefrom. In the above cases (a)<br>
and (b) , the drums and materials may be heated or treated with<br>
supersonic waves to promote the effect of parting.<br>

soluble nylon can be given.<br>
The parting agent of the present invention is particular<br>
preferable for removing epoxy resin adhesive among these<br>
adhesives. The epoxy resin adhesive comprises an epoxy resin<br>
and a curing agent as essential components and optionally<br>
contains additives such as fillers and denaturing agents. As<br>

room temperature setting adhesives, one-solution potential<br>
curing type paste adhesives, one-solution potential curing type<br>
film adhesives, one-solution curing type powdery adhesives, and<br>
the like can be given. The solvent of the present invention<br>
can be used as parting agent for any types of adhesive.<br>
The epoxy resin adhesives are used, for example, for<br>
adhering a semiconductor ingot of silicon or the like fabricated<br>
to have a prescribed outside configuration to a slice space of<br>
carbon or the like. The adhered material is cut into wafers<br>
or plates using a slicing machine (slicer) of inner circle<br>
edge-type, band saw-type, or wire saw-type. After removing the<br>
slice space and epoxy resin adhesive, the wafers or plates are<br>
sent to the next steps for annealing, wrapping, and the like.<br>

calculated from the results of gas chromatography analysis of<br>
the reaction mixture before extraction procedures was 73%.<br>
Almost no diethyl ether was collected in the trap of evaporator.<br>
Comparative Example 7 Preparation of 1-hydroxy-l-<br>
phenylcyclopentane and phenylcyclopentene using diethyl ether<br>
as an extraction solvent<br>
An aqueous solution obtained by neutralizing the product<br>
of Example 3 with hydrochloric acid was charged into a<br>
69<br><br>
separating funnel to carry out the same extraction experiment<br>
as in Example 6, except that diethyl ether was used as the<br>
extraction solvent and the extraction procedure was carried out<br>
three times using 20 ml of diethyl ether. 5.2 g of a crude<br>
product was obtained. The recovery rate of the target product<br>
calculated from the results of gas chromatography analysis of<br>
the reaction mixture before extraction procedures was 73%.<br>
Almost no diethyl ether was collected in the trap of evaporator.<br>
The results of Examples 6-7 and Comparative Example 6-7<br>
confirmed a superior extraction effect of the extraction<br>
solvent of the present invention. Efficient recovery of CPME<br>
used for extraction was also confirmed.<br>
Example 8 Fabrication of information recording medium<br>
Cyanine dyes of the following formulas A, B, and C were<br>
dissolved in CPME obtained in Preparation Example 1 to obtain<br>
coating solutions, each having a dye concentration of 2.0 wt% .<br>
The coating solutions were applied to the surface of<br>
polycarbonate substrates (outside dimension: 130 mm, internal<br>
diameter 15 mm, thickness 1.2 mm, track pitch: 1.6 m, groove<br>
depth: SO mu) by spin coating (2000 rpm). The coatings were<br>
dried at 100°C for 10 minutes to obtain recording medium layers<br>
with a thickness of 0.08 m.<br>
70<br><br><br>
Neither swelling nor dissolution of the polycarbonate<br>
resin was observed during the process of forming the recording<br>
medium layers (coating and drying). The resulting recording<br>
media were checked for recording-reproduction characteristics<br>
to confirm that the characteristics were excellent.<br>
Example 9 Production of OPC drum<br>
10 aluminum pipes (thickness: 0.4 mm, diameter: 30 mm,<br>
length: 253 mm) were used for the experiment. Notches (width:<br>
71<br><br>
2 mm, length: 3mm) were formed at the ends of the pipes using<br>
a 5 kW carbon dioxide laser to obtain drums for preparing OPC<br>
drums. 3 parts by weight of X-type metal-free phthalocyanine<br>
and 20 parts by weight of 2-butanone were added to and<br>
homogeneously dispersed in a solution of one part by weight<br>
polyvinyl butyral resin (BM-1, manufactured by Sekisui Chemical<br>
Co., Ltd.) in 20 parts by weight of CPME to obtain a coating<br>
solution for forming a charge generation layer. The drum was<br>
dipped in this coating solution at 25°C for one minute, removed<br>
from the solution, and dried at 100°C for five minutes in a<br>
nitrogen gas stream, thereby forming a charge generation layer<br>
with a thickness of 0.25 am.<br>
Next, 300 parts of N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-(m-tolyl)<br>
benzidine and 64 parts of polycarbonate resin were added to and<br>
dissolved in a mixed solvent of CPME prepared in Preparation<br>
Example 1 and n-hexane (5:1 by weight), thereby obtaining a<br>
coating solution for forming a charge transfer layer. The above<br>
drum on which the charge generation layer has been formed was<br>
dipped in this coating solution for forming a charge transfer<br>
layer at 2 5°C for one minute, removed from the solution, and<br>
dried at 110ºC in a nitrogen gas stream to form a charge transfer<br>
layer on the charge generation layer, thereby obtaining an OPC<br>
drum. This procedure was repeated to obtain 10 OPC drums. The<br>
charge generation layer of the resulting OPC drums has a uniform<br>
thickness (18-19 m) , with only the least defects such as uneven<br>
coating.<br>
72<br><br>
Comparative Example 9 Production of QPC drum<br>
10 photosensitive drums were obtained in the same manner<br>
as in Example 9, except for using 300 parts of a mixed solvent<br>
of THF and n-hexane (5:1 by weight) -instead of 300 parts, of the<br>
mixed solvent of CPME and n-hexane. The charge transfer layer<br>
of the resulting OPC drums has a uniform thickness (17-20 m) ,<br>
with greater unevenness in the coating thickness as compared<br>
with the thickness of the charge transfer layer of the OPC drums<br>
in Example 9. One photosensitive drum having a charge transfer<br>
layer thickness of 17 fom and another drum having a -charge<br>
transfer layer thickness of 20 m were regarded as defective<br>
products.<br>
Example 10 Peeling of photosensitive layer from OPC drum<br>
The two OPC drums evaluated as defective products in<br>
Comparative Example 9 were dipped in the mixed solvent of CPME<br>
prepared in Preparation Example 1 and n-hexane (5:1 by weight) .<br>
After 10 minutes, the photosensitive drum was removed from the<br>
solution to confirm that the photosensitive layers (charge<br>
generating layer and charge Lransfer layer) were completely<br>
peeled from the drum surface and clean drums were recovered.<br>
The photosensitive layers can be formed on the recovered drums<br>
according to the same procedure as in Example 9.<br>
Examples 11-12 and Comparative Examples 10-11 Test for<br>
73<br><br>
releasability of epoxy resin_adhesive_<br>
Specimens for the releasability test were prepared by<br>
attaching orientation flat parts of three sheets of 8 inch<br>
silicon wafer at intervals of 1 cm on a glass plate (1 cm x 6<br>
cm x 15 cm) using an epoxy resin adhesive (W-BOND manufactured<br>
by Nikka Seiko Co., Ltd.) The epoxy resin adhesive was used<br>
by mixing the main component with a curing agent at a ratio by<br>
weight of 2:1. The mixture was applied to the glass plate to<br>
which the silicon wafer was caused to adhere, cured at 90°C for<br>
one hour, and allowed to stand for 3 hours at room temperature.<br>
The test specimens obtained above were dipped in parting<br>
agent solutions listed m Table 4 under the conditions<br>
(temperature and supersonic treatment) shown in Table 4. The<br>
test specimens were removed from the solutions to determine the<br>
period of time required for three sheets of silicon wafer to<br>
become detached. The average time for three sheets was regarded<br>
as the parting time (minute) . A short parting time indicates<br>
that only a short period of time was required for removing the<br>
epoxy adhesive and the solvent used has excellent parting<br>
capability. An ultrasonic irradiation apparatus (Type: SILENT<br>
3GNICUT-204, 39 kHz, 200 W, 8 . 6 L, manufactured by Sharp Corp.<br>
was used for the ultrasonic treatment.<br>
Parting agents used, dipping temperature (°C) ,<br>
application of ultrasonic treatment, and parting time (minute)<br>
	are shown in Table 4.<br>

It can be seen from Table 4 that the solvent of the present<br>
invention exhibits more excellent releasability performance<br>
for an epoxy resin adhesive than comparative parting agents<br>
(isopropyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol).<br>
Preparation Example 2<br>
10 g of a commercially available styrene-based acidic<br>
ion-exchange resin (RCP 145, water content 46 wt%, manufactured<br>
by Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.) was dried in a drier at about 105°C<br>
for 10 hours and then in a desiccator at room temperature for<br>
two weeks. The water content of the dry ion-exchange resin was<br>
analyzed by Karl-Fischer coulometric titration and found to be<br>
3.0 wt%.<br>
The dry ion-exchange resin was filled in a reaction tube<br>
with a diameter of 1" (2.54 cm) and a length of 40 cm. After<br>
feeding dry nitrogen gas for five hours at 100°C, the reaction<br>
tube was cooled to room temperature. The water content of the<br>
75<br><br>
resuJ.ting dry ion-exchange resin was analyzed by Karl-Fischer<br>
coulometric titration to 'find that water content was 1.5 wt%.<br>
The acidic ion-exchange resin (hereinafter referred to as "dry<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin") obtained in this manner was used<br>
for the reaction.<br>
Hiranuma water content analyzer (AQ-7, manufactured by<br>
Hiranuma Industry Co., Ltd.) was used for the determination of<br>
water content by the Karl Fischer method. Hydeliner (R) and<br>
Aqualite (RS-A) were used as generating solutions and Aqualite<br>
(CN) was used as a counter electrode solution.<br>
Example 13 Preparation of cyclopentyl methyl ether<br>
A tightly closable reaction vessel (internal volume: 200<br>
ml) made of stainless steel was charged with 3.4 g (0.05 mol)<br>
of cyclopentene, 32 g (1.0 mol) of methanol, and 3.0 g of dry<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin. After tightly closing the reaction<br>
vessel, the mixture was stirred for 6-8 hours at 120°C under<br>
a pressure of 2 . 5 Mpa. After the reaction, the reaction vessel<br>
was opened and the reaction mixture was analyzed by gas<br>
chromatography to confirm that the conversion rate of<br>
cyclopencene was 30%.<br>
Insoluble matters were separated from the reaction<br>
mixture by filtration. The resulting filtrate was distilled<br>
under atmospheric pressure using a Vigreux rectifying column<br>
to obtain cyclopentyl methyl ether in an isolation yield of 27%.<br>
76<br><br>
Comparative Example 12<br>
The same experiment as in Example 13 was carried out,<br>
except for using an acidic ion-exchange resin with a water<br>
content of 4 6 wt% (RCP145, manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical<br>
Corp.) instead of the dry acidic ion-exchange resin. The<br>
resulting reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography<br>
to confirm that the conversion rate of cyclopentyl methyl ether<br>
was only 0.4%.<br>
In the same manner as in Example 13, insoluble matters<br>
were separated from the reaction mixture by filtration. The<br>
resulting filtrate was distilled under atmospheric pressure<br>
using a Vigreux rectifying column to obtain cyclopentyl methyl<br>
ether in an isolation yield of 0.3%.<br>
Comparative Example 13<br>
A tightly closable reaction vessel (internal volume: 200<br>
ml) made of stainless steel was charged with 3.4 g (0.05 mol)<br>
of cyclopentene, 32 g (1.0 mol) of methanol, and 3.0 g of<br>
synthetic zeolite catalyst (Z5M-5 manufactured by Mobile R&amp;D<br>
Corp.) . After tightly closing the reaction vessel, the mixture<br>
WAS Stirred for 6-3 hours al 12G°C under a pressure or l.0 Mpa.<br>
The resulting reaction mixture was analyzed by gas<br>
chromatography to confirm that the conversion rate of<br>
cyclopentyl methyl ether was only 0.07%. Distillation of the<br>
mixture in the same manner as in Example 13 failed to isolate<br>
the cyclopentyl methyl ether which was only present in a slight<br>
77<br><br>
amount.<br>
Preparation Example 3-8<br>
Various acidic ion-exchange resins Al-Gl were dried in<br>
the same manner as in Preparation Example 2 to obtain dry acidic<br>
ion-exchange resins A2-G2, respectively. The water content of<br>
the dry acidic ion-exchange resins was analyzed to find that<br>
water content was 1.5 wt% or less for all of them as shown in<br>
Table 5.<br>
The sources of the acidic ion-exchange resins Al-Gl were<br>
as follows.<br>
Acidic ion-exchange resins Al: SPC108 (manufactured by<br>

In the following description, the ion-exchange resin<br>
78<br><br>
produced by drying the acidic ion-exchange resin Al is called<br>
dry acidic ion-exchange resin A2. The same applies to dry<br>
acidic ion-exchange resins B2-G2.<br>
Examples 14-20<br>
The reactor shown in. Figure l(b) was used in Examples<br>
14-20. The reaction columns 3b, 3c made by SUS with a diameter<br>
of 2.54 cm (1") and a length of 40 cm was packed with the above<br>
dry acidic ion-exchange resins A2-G2 (amount: about 80 ml) . The<br>
whole columns 3b, 3c were maintained at 90°C.<br>
A mixture of cyclopentene and methanol (mol ratio : 1. 6 :1)<br>
was sent from a storage tank 1, heated at 90°C to vaporize in<br>
a heater/vaporizer 2b, and continuously charged to the reaction<br>
column 3b at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 90°C under atmospheric<br>
pressure. Seven hours after start of the reaction, the reaction<br>
liquid flowing from one of the exits of the reaction column 3c<br>
was analyzed by gas chromatography.<br>
The reaction solutions extracted from the reaction<br>
column 3c during the seven hours after start of the reaction<br>
were combined and distilled under atmospheric pressure using<br>
a Vigreux rectifying column to obtain cyclopentyi methyl ether.<br>
The purity of the resulting cyclopentyi methyl ether was 99%<br>
or more.<br>
The type and water content of the dry acidic ion-exchange<br>
resin, isolation yield of cyclopentyi methyl ether, conversion<br>
rate of methanol, and reaction selectivity of cyclopentyi<br>
79<br><br>
methyl ether are summarized in Table 5, wherein CPME indicates<br>
cyclopentyl methyl ether and MeOH indicates methanol.<br>
Comparative Examples 14-20<br>
The same experiment as in Examples 14-20 was carried out,<br>
except for using acidic ion-exchange resins Al-Gl with a water<br>
content of 40-70 wt% instead of the dry acidic ion-exchange<br>
resins A2-G2. The type of the acidic ion-exchange resins,<br>
content, conversion rate of methanol, and reaction selectivity<br>
are summarized in Table 5. Cyclopentyl methyl ether could not<br>
be isolated because the amount produced was too small.<br>

As can be seen from Table 5, better results have been<br>
obtained for all of the isolation yield of cyclopentyl methyl<br>
ether (CPME), the conversion rate of methanol, and the reaction<br>
selectivity in the experiments in Examples 14-20 in which dry<br>
acidic ion-exchange resins were used than in the experiments<br>
in Comparative Examples 14-20 in which acidic ion-exchange<br>

Example 21 Preparation of reaction solvent<br>
A vessel with a stirrer was charged with 100 parts of<br>
CPME obtained in Example 13 and 10 parts of a commercially<br>
available dehydrating agent (MS-4A). After stirring for five<br>
minutes, the CPME was allowed to stand in the vessel, which was<br>
placed at a room temperature in a dry box in which nitrogen gas<br>
was circulated, for 18 hours during which change in the water<br>
content in CPME over time was measured. The results are shown<br>
in Table 6.<br>
2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol was added to the dehydrated<br>
CPME to a concentration of 250 ppm. The mixture was stirred<br>
to obtain a reaction solvent (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"Solvent A") with a water content of 25 ppm.<br>
Comparative Example 21 Preparation of reaction solvent<br>
A vessel with a stirrer was charged with 100 parts of<br>
a commercially available THF (purity: 99.9%, manufactured by<br>
Aldrich Co.) and 10 parts of a commercially available<br>
dehydrating agent (MS-4A). After stirring for five minutes,<br>
the THF was allowed to stand in the vessel, which was placed<br>
at a room temperature in a dry box in which nitrogen gas was<br>
circulated, for 18 hours to obtain THF for reaction (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "Solvent B"). Change in the water content in<br>
THF over time was measured and the results are shown in Table<br>
6.<br>

It can be seen from the results shown in Table 6 that<br>
CPME can be dehydrated with MS more easily than THF.<br>
Example 22 Synthesis of a,a-dimethylbenzyl alcohol using<br>
Solvent A<br>
40 parts of a 1 M phenylmagnesium bromide (PhMgBr)<br>
solution in Solvent A was added to a flask, of which the<br>
atmosphere has been replaced with nitrogen, and stirred at 0°C<br>
for 30 minutes. A solution of 1.74 parts of acetone in 70 parts<br>
of Solvent A was slowly added dropwise to the PhMgBr solution<br>
at 0°C. After stirring at 0°C for one hour, the reaction mixture<br>
was heated to 50°C and stirred for a further one hour. After<br>
cooling to room temperature, the reaction was terminated with<br>
the addition of 20 parts of 1 N hydrochloric acid aqueous<br>
solution. The reaction mixture was analyzed by gas<br>
chromatography to confirm that the target a,a-dimethylbenzyl<br>
alcohol was obtained in a yield of 85%.<br>
83<br><br>
50 parts of water was added to partition the mixture into<br>
two layers. The organic layer was removed and distilled under<br>
atmospheric pressure using a Vigreux rectification column to<br>
obtain 99 parts of fractions distilled at 100-106°C. Gas<br>
chromatography analysis confirmed that the distillate<br>
contained 99% or more of CPME. The distillate can be used again<br>
as a solvent.<br>
Example 23 Synthesis of ,-dimethylbenzyl alcohol using<br>
recovered CPME<br>
,-dimethylbenzyl alcohol was prepared in the same<br>
manner as in Example 22 using the CPME recovered in the Example<br>
22 to obtain the ,-dimethylbenzyl alcohol in a yield of 85%.<br>
The experiment confirmed that cyclopentyl methyl ether can be<br>
repeatedly used as a reaction solvent.<br>
Comparative Example 22 Synthesis of a, a-dimethylbenzyl alcohol<br>
using Solvent B<br>
The same experiment as in Example 22 was carried out,<br>
except for Solvent B instead of Solvent A. The resulting<br>
reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography under the<br>
same conditions as above to confirm that the yield of the target<br>
compound was only 50%.<br>
Example 24 Oil and fat solubility test<br>
The same solubility test as in Example 1 was carried out<br>
84<br><br>
except for using a cleaning solvent prepared by adding 250 ppm<br>
of 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol to CPME produced in Example 13.<br>
The results shown in Table 2 were obtained.<br>
Example 2 5 Peroxide production test<br>
A cleaning solvent with the same composition as that used<br>
in Example 24 was put into a 20 ml clear glass bottle and allowed<br>
to stand at room temperature without shielding from light to<br>
observe peroxide production. Peroxides were measured using<br>
the iodine ion reduction titration method based on the JIS K9705 .<br>
