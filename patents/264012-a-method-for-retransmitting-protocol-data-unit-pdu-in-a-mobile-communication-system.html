				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system, and more particularly,<br>
to transmitting data in the mobile communication system,<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIG. 1 is a structural diagram illustrating a Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile<br>
communication system. The LTE system is an evolved version of a conventional Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and is being standardized under the 3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) collaboration agreement.<br>
An LTE network may be generally classified into an Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access Network (E-UTRAN) and a Core Network (CN). The E-UTRAN includes at least<br>
one eNode-B serving as a base station. The E-UTRAN also includes an Access Gateway<br>
(AG) located at the end of the network so that it is connected to an external network.<br>
The AG may be classified into a user-traffic processing unit and a control-traffic<br>
processing unit. In this case, a first AG for processing new user traffic data may<br>
communicate with a second AG for processing control traffic data via a new interface, A<br>
single eNode-B may include at least one cell. A first interface for transmitting user traffic<br>
data or a second interface for transmitting control traffic data may be located between several<br>
eNode-Bs. The CN includes the AG and a plurality of nodes for registering users of User<br>
Equipments (UEs). If required, another interface for discriminating between the E-UTRAN<br>
and the CN may also be used in the LTE network.<br>
Two important elements of the LTE network are an eNode-B and a UE. Radio<br>
resources of a single cell include uplink radio resources and downlink radio resources. The<br><br>
eNode-B allocates and controls the uplink and downlink radio resources. In more detail, the<br>
eNode-B determines which one of a plurality of UEs will use specific radio resources at a<br>
specific time. After performing determination, the eNode-B informs the specific UE of its<br>
decision, such that the eNode-B controls the UE to receive the downlink data. For example,<br>
the eNode-B may allocate radio resources ranging from 100MHz to 101 MHz to a specific<br>
UE (e.g., No.l UE) after the lapse of a predetermined time of 3.2 seconds. Accordingly, the<br>
eNode-B may transmit downlink data to the No. 1 UE during a specific time of 0.2 seconds<br>
after the lapse of the predetermined time of 3.2 seconds.<br>
In this way, the eNode-B determines which one of the plurality of UEs will perform<br>
uplink data transmission and the amount of radio resources the UE can use at a specific time.<br>
Moreover, the eNode-B determines a duration of time the UE has to transmit the uplink data.<br>
Compared with a conventional art Node-B or base station, the above-mentioned<br>
eNode-B can effectively and dynamically manage radio resources. In the conventional art, a<br>
single UE is controlled to continuously use a single radio resource during a call connection<br>
time. However, considering the existence of a variety of recent services based on Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) packets, the conventional art is ineffective. For example, most packet services<br>
have several intervals, wherein no data is transmitted and no packets are generated during the<br>
call connection time. Thus, if radio resources are continuously allocated to only one UE, as<br>
in the conventional art, the allocation scheme is deemed ineffective. In order to solve this<br>
and other problems, the E-UTRAN system has been designed to allocate radio resources to a<br>
UE only when there is a need to use the UE, such as when service data is to be transmitted to<br>
theUE.<br>
Uplink and downlink channels for transmitting data between the network and the UE<br>
will hereinafter be described in detail. There exist downlink channels for transmitting data<br>
from the network to the UE, such as a Broadcast Channel (BCH) for transmitting system<br><br>
information, and a downlink Shared Channel (SCH) and downlink Shared Control Channel<br>
(SCCH) for transmitting user traffic data or control messages. The traffic data or control<br>
messages of a downlink multicast service or broadcast service may be transmitted over the<br>
downlink shared channel (SCH), or additionally over a Multicast Channel (MCH).<br>
Furthermore, there also exist uplink channels for transmitting data from the UE to the<br>
network, such as a Random Access Channel (RACH), and an uplink shared channel (SCH)<br>
and uplink shared control channel (SCCH) for transmitting user traffic data ox control<br>
messages.<br>
FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 are conceptual diagrams illustrating a. radio interface protocol<br>
structure between the UE and the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) based<br>
on a 3 GPP radio access network standard.<br>
The radio interface protocol horizontally includes a physical layer, a data link layer and<br>
a network layer. The radio interface protocol vertically includes a User Plane for transmitting<br>
data or information and a Control Plane for transmitting a control signal (also called<br>
"signaling data"). The protocol layers shown may be classified into a first layer (Ll), a<br>
second layer (L2) and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of a well-known<br>
interconnection scheme, such as an Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model.<br>
The physical layer acting as the first layer (Ll) provides an Information Transfer<br>
Service over a physical channel. A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the third<br>
layer (L3) controls radio resources between the UE and the network. For this purpose, the<br>
RRC layer exchanges RRC messages between the UE and the network- The RRC layer may<br>
be distributed to a plurality of network nodes (i.e., eNode-B and AG, etc.), and may also be<br>
located at the eNode-B or the AG.<br>
A radio protocol control plane will hereinafter be described with reference to FIG,<br>
2. The radio protocol control plane includes a physical layer, a Medium Access Control<br><br>
(MAC) layer, a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer, and a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer.<br>
The physical layer acting as the first layer (LI) transmits an Information Transfer<br>
Service to an upper layer over a physical channel. The physical layer is connected to the<br>
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer (L2 layer) via a transport channel. The MAC layer<br>
communicates with the physical layer such that data is communicated between the MAC<br>
layer and the physical layer over the transport channel. Data may be communicated among<br>
different physical layers. Specifically, data is communicated between a first physical layer of<br>
a transmission end and a second physical layer of a reception end.<br>
The MAC layer of the second layer (L2) transmits a variety of services to the RLC<br>
(Radio Link Control) layer (L2 layer) over a logical channel. The RLC layer of the second<br>
Layer (L2) supports transmission of reliable data. A variety of functions of the RLC layer<br>
may also be implemented with a function block of the MAC layer. In this case, no RLC layer<br>
is necessary.<br>
The RRC (Radio Resource Control) layer located at the uppermost part of the third<br>
layer (L3) is defined by the control plane only- The RRC layer controls logical channels,<br>
transport channels, and physical channels in relation to configuration, reconfiguration, and<br>
release operations of Radio Bearers (RBs). Here, an RB is indicative of a service received<br>
from the second layer (L2) to implement data communication between the UE and the E-<br>
UTRAN.<br>
A radio protocol user plane will hereinafter be described with reference to FIG. 3. The<br>
radio protocol user plane includes the physical layer, the MAC layer, the RLC layer, and a<br>
Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer<br>
The physical layer of the first layer (LI) and the MAC and RLC layers of the second<br>
layer (L2) are equal to those of FIG. 2. In order to effectively transmit IP packets (e.g., IPv4<br>
or IPv6) within a radio communication period having a narrow bandwidth, a PDCP layer of<br><br>
the second layer (L2) performs header compressiDn to reduce the size of a relatively large IP<br>
packet header containing unnecessary control information.<br>
A detailed description of the RLC layer will hereinafter be described in detail. The<br>
principal functions of the RLC layer are for guaranteeing a Quality of Service (QoS) of each<br>
RB and transmitting data associated with the QoS. The RB service is indicative of a specific<br>
service provided to an upper layer by the second layer of the radio protocol, such that all parts<br>
of the second layer affect the QoS. Specifically, it should be noted that the second layer is<br>
greatly affected by the RLC layer. The RLC layer assigns an independent RLC entity to each<br>
RB to guarantee a unique QoS of the RB. In this case, the RLC entity configises an RLC<br>
protocol data unit (PDU) according to the size of radio resources determined by a lower layer<br>
(i.e., the MAC layer).<br>
Therefore, when transmitting the RLC PDU to the MAC layer, the RLC entity located<br>
at the eNode-B configures data having a predetermined size determined by the MAC entity,<br>
and transmits the RLC PDU to the MAC entity. The RLC entity located at the UE also<br>
configures the RLC PDU according to the size of radio resources determined by the lower<br>
layer (i.e., the MAC layer). Therefore, when transmitting the RLC PDU to the MAC layer,<br>
the RLC entity located at the UE configures data having a predetermined size determined by<br>
the MAC entity, and transmits the RLC PDU to the MAC entity.<br>

Best mode for carrying out the invention<br>
The present invention relates to transmitting data in a mobile communication system.<br><br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the<br>
same or like parts. A method for transmitting data of a mobile communication system<br>
according to the present invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
Prior to describing the present invention, it should be noted that the following preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention allow an RLC layer to reconfigure information<br>
received from an upper layer in the above-mentioned hierarchical structure shown in the<br>
conventional art, and transmit the reconfigured information to the MAC Layer. However, it is<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art that the scope of the present invention is not limited to only<br>
the above-mentioned RLC layer's transmission case, and can also be applied to other<br>
examples. First information, transmitted from an upper layer and received by the RLC layer<br>
is referred to as an RLC service data unit (SDU). Second information, which comprises the<br>
RLC SDU reconfigured by the RLC layer and transmitted to the MAC layer, is referred to as<br>
an RLC PDU. Third information, which comprises the RLC PDU reconfigured by the MAC<br>
layer, is referred to as a MAC PDU.<br>
The RLC layer provides two RLC modes, i.e., an Unacknowledged Mode (UM or UM<br>
mc.de) and an Acknowledged Mode (AM or AM mode). The UM and AM modes support<br>
different QoSs, such that a difference in operation methods exists between them. Detailed<br>
functions of the UM and AM modes are also different from each other Accordingly the<br>
function of the RLC layer according to its operation modes will be described.<br>
As a matter of convenience and better understanding of the present invention, the RLC<br>
in the UM mode is referred to as a UM RLC while the RLC in the AM mode is referred to as<br>
an AM RLC The UM RLC attaches a PDU header including a sequence number (SN) to<br>
each PDU generated, and transmits the resultant PDU equipped with the PDU header, such<br><br>
that a reception end can recognize which one of a plurality of PDUs is lost during<br>
transmission. Accordingly, the UM RLC preferably performs transmission of<br>
broadcast/multicast data or transmission of real-time packet data (e.g., voice over Internet<br>
protocol (VoIP) or streaming) of a Packet Service (PS) domain in a user plane. In a control<br>
plane, the UM RLC preferably performs transmission of a UM RRC message from among a<br>
plurality of RRC messages transmitted to a specific UE or specific UE group contained in a<br>
cell.<br>
The AM RLC attaches the PDU header including the SN to each PDU generated in the<br>
same manner as the UM RLC; however, in contrast to the UM RLC, the AM RLC commands<br>
a reception end to acknowledge the PDU transmitted from a transmission end. Accordingly,<br>
when performing the PDU acknowledgment, the reception end may request retransmission of<br>
any PDU not received from the transmission end.<br>
By utilizing the retransmission function, the AM RLC can guarantee transmission of<br>
error-free data. Accordingly, the AM RLC performs transmission of non-real-time packet<br>
data such as a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) of the PS domain in<br>
the user plane, hi the control plane, the AM RLC performs transmission of an RRC message<br>
requiring an acknowledgement response (AM RRC message) from among a plurality of RRC<br>
messages transmitted to a specific UE contained in a cell.<br>
Directionally, the AM RLC is used for bi-directional communication because a<br>
feedback signal is received from the reception end, whereas the UM RLC is used for uni-<br>
directional communication. Preferably, the bi-directional communication is used for a point-<br>
to-point (PTP) communication, such that the AM RLC employs a dedicated logical channel.<br>
Structurally, the UM RLC includes a single RLC entity comprising a single<br>
transmission structure or a single reception structure. In contrast, the AM RLC includes a<br>
single RLC entity comprising the transmission structure and the reception structure. The AM<br><br>
RLC structure is more complex because of the retransmission function. In order to manage<br>
the retransmission function, the AM RLC includes a transmission/reception buffer as well as<br>
a retransmission buffer, and performs a variety of functions. The AM RLC functions<br>
comprise a usage function of a transmission/reception window for flow control, a polling<br>
function for requesting status information from the reception end of a peer-RLC entity by the<br>
transmission end, a status report function for allowing the reception end to report its buffer<br>
state to the transmission end of the peer-RLC entity, a status PDU function for carrying status<br>
information, and a piggyback function for inserting a status PDU in a data PDU to increase<br>
efficiency of data transmission, for example.<br>
Additionally, if the AM RLC detects important errors during its operation, the AM<br>
RLC may perform additional functions, such as a reset PDU function for requesting re-<br>
configuration of all operations and parameters from a counterpart AM RLC entity and a reset<br>
ACK PDU function for replying to the reset PDU, for example.<br>
In order to support the above-mentioned functions, the AM RLC requires a variety of<br>
protocol parameters, status variables, and a timer. A variety of PDUs used for the above-<br>
mentioned functions, such as the status report function, the status PDU function and the reset<br>
PDU function, as well as PDUs for controlling AM RLC data transmission are referred to as<br>
control PDUs. Other PDUs for transmitting user data are referred to as data PDUs.<br>
Preferably, the AM mode uses Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) information and the<br>
UM mode does not. Here, the ARQ information is indicative of transmission/reception<br>
acknowledgement (ACK) information. Preferably, the transmission/reception ACK<br>
information indicates information related to a data block normally transmitted from the<br>
transmission end to the reception end, or other information related to an erroneous data block<br>
abnormally transmitted from the transmission end to the reception end.<br>
A representative example of an RLC PDU format for use in the UM mode is shown in<br><br><br>
corresponding RLC PDU, or indicates location information on a logical channel. A<br>
complete/partial (C/P) field indicates whether a first data part of the RLC PDU is equal to a<br>
first part of an associated SDU. The C/P field also indicates whether a last data part of the.<br>
RLC PDU is equal to and end part of any associated SDUs.<br>
For example, if the value of the C/P field is "00", the beginning part of the PDU is<br>
equal to the beginning part of the SDU, and the end of the PDU is equal to the end of the<br>
SDU. If the value of the C/P field is "01", the beginning part of the PDU is equal to the<br>
beginning part of the SDU, and the end of the PDU is not equal to the end of the SDU. If the<br>
value of the C/P field is "10", the beginning part of the PDU is not equal to the beginning part<br>
of the SDU, and the end of the PDU is equal the end of the SDU. If the value of the C/P field<br>
is "11", the beginning part of the PDU is not equal to the beginning part of the SDU, and the<br>
end of the PDU is not equal to the end of the SDU.<br>
A length indicator (LI) field indicates a boundary of an RLC SDU. Thus, if a single<br>
RLC PDU includes two RLC SDUs, the reception end can separate between the RLC SDUs<br>
using the boundary information of the RLC SDU. A following (F) field indicates whether a<br>
next field is the LI field or data.<br>
Compared with the AM mode, the RLC PDU format of the UM mode need not<br>
transmit/receive the transmission/reception acknowledgment information. Accordingly, the<br>
RLC PDU of the UM mode is simpler than the AM mode and can have one header format.<br>
Moreover, if a transmission time point of a corresponding RLC PDU can be distinguished by<br><br>
a lower end according to retransmission information (i.e., redundancy-version information),<br>
then the SN field maybe deleted.<br>
A representative example of an ARQ RLC PDU format for transmission of general data<br>
in the AM mode is shown in Table 2.<br>
[Table 2]<br><br>
A representative example of an ARQ RLC PDU format for transmission of control<br>
information (e.g., transmission/reception acknowledgment information) in the AM mode is<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
[Table 3]<br><br>
Preferably, if the ARQ RLC PDU format of Table 2 cannot be transmitted to a<br>
destination without any change under the AM mode, an ARQ RLC subPDU is configured.<br>
Accordingly, a representative example of the ARQ RLC subPDU is shown in Table 4.<br>
[Table 4]<br><br>
With reference to Tables 2,3, and 4, the SN field, the C/P field, the LI  field and the F<br>
field are equal to those of Table 1. Therefore, their detailed description will herein be omitted<br>
for convenience.<br>
A Control/Data/Subframe (C/D/S) field indicates whether a corresponding RLC PDU is<br>
the ARQ RLC PDU, the ARQ RLC control PDU, or the ARQ RLC subPDU. A sub frame<br>
Sequence Number (sSN) field indicates location information of a corresponding subPDU<br>
from among a plurality of associated subPDUs. A remaining (RM) field indicates the<br><br>
presence or absence of associated subPDUs after the corresponding subPDU. In view of this,<br>
the ARQ RLC subPDU shown in Table 4 will be described in detail with reference to the<br>
following preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
FIG 4 is a diagram illustrating a method for constructing a MAC PDU in an RLC SDU<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, tine present<br>
invention is a method for constructing a data unit in the RLC or MAC layer.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MAC layer of the UE receives information indicating an<br>
amount of available radio resources from an eNode-B. Preferably, the MAC layer receives<br>
specific information indicating an amount of radio resources that can be used during a next<br>
transmission time from the eNode-B.<br>
From die perspective of the eNode-B, the MAC layer of the e"Node-B determines<br>
whether downlink or uplink radio resources will be used. The MAC layer of the eNode-B<br>
also determines the amount of radio resources that will be allocated tg individual UEs during<br>
a next transmission period and informs the MAC layer of each UE of the determination. By<br>
considering a plurality of data units stored in the UEs1 buffers and a priority of the data units,<br>
each of the UEs determine the amount of data that will be transmitted through each logical<br>
channel or from each RLC entity. In other words, each RLC entity determines the si2e of the<br>
RLC PDU to be transmitted to the MAC layer.<br>
Accordingly, by considering an amount of downlink data of the UEs and priority of<br>
each data, the MAC layer located at the eNode-B determines the amount of data that will be<br>
allocated to individual RLC entities, and informs each RLC of the determination. Each RLC<br>
then configures the RLC PDU according to the determination,, and transmits the RLC PDU to<br>
the MAC layer.<br>
Preferably, the MAC entity is connected 1o several RLC entities, Each RLC entity<br>
receives an RLC SDU from an upper layer, generates an RLC PDU by applying a command<br><br>
of the MAC layer to the received RLC SDU, and transmits the generated RLC PDU to the<br>
MAC entity. The MAC entity combines RLC PDUs received from individual RLC entities,<br>
configures the combined RLC PDUs in the form of a single MAC PDU, and transmits the<br>
single MAC PDU to a physical layer.<br>
In order to improve communication efficiency under the aforementioned situation, it is<br>
preferable that the number of padding bits contained in the MAC PDU or the RLC PDU be<br>
reduced. Preferably, a predetermined number of bits used for adjusting the size are reduced.<br>
For this operation, the MAC entity receives data from several logical channels (i.e., several<br>
RLC entities) and configures the MAC PDU using the received data.<br>
However, in order to command the reception end to normally recover the RLC PDUs<br>
from the MAC PDU7 specific information for indicating the amount of data contained in each<br>
logical channel is needed. Therefore, it is preferable to include information indicating an<br>
amount of data corresponding to individual logical channels or other information indicating<br>
identifiers (IDs) of the logical channels.<br>
Preferably, the reception end extracts information of the RLC PDU using a logical<br>
channel ID contained in the MAC PDU header and data-block size information of each<br>
logical channel. The reception end then transmits the extracted information to the<br>
corresponding RLC entities.<br>
Operations of the MAC and RLC layers according to the present invention will<br>
hereinafter be described with further reference to FIG 4. The MAC PDU includes a MAC<br>
header and an RLC PDU. The RLC PDU includes data of the RLC SDU and segment<br>
information associated with the RLC SDU received from the upper layer The segment<br>
information performs a function similar to the RLC header. Preferably, the segment<br>
information includes boundary information of the RLC SDU in a single RLC PDU, for<br>
example. The MAC header indicates the size of each RLC PDU contained in the MAC PDU<br><br>
and which one of a plurality of RLC entities or logic channels corresponds to each RLC PDU.<br>
If control information (e.g., status report information) for indicating a reception status<br>
is contained in the MAC PDU, the control information is contained in a single RLC PDU.<br>
Accordingly, the MAC header may indicate the presence of the control information. In this<br>
case, the control information tnay be exemplarily implemented with a method for employing<br>
a logical channel ID having a special value.<br>
FIG 5 is a structural diagram illustrating a MAC PDU format in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, the MAC PDU is based on the RLC PDU<br>
received from an upper RLC entity.<br>
Referring to FIG 5, an RLC ID field indicates that a corresponding RLC PDU has been<br>
received over a specific logical channel or from a specific RLC entity. A Length field<br>
indicates the size of each RLC PDU. The F field indicates whether following values are<br>
acquired by a combination of the RLC ID field, the Length field and the F field or whether<br>
the following values are real RLC PDUs.<br>
Notably, data may be unexpectedly lost over physical channels of communication<br>
systems. Compared to the conventional system, the physical layer of a UTRAN system can<br>
more correctly transmit data from the transmission end to the reception end. However, the<br>
probability of data transmission error is not completely removed from the UTRAN system.<br>
Specifically, the longer the distance from the UE to the eNode-B, the higher the data loss rate<br>
of the UE.<br>
Therefore, the communication system of the present invention requires a special<br>
management method such as when TCP data requires error-free transmission or signaling<br>
data. Accordingly, the communication system may use the AM mode. With regard to a TCP<br>
packet, the size of the TCP packet can be extended to 1500 bytes. Therefore, if the TCP<br>
packet configured in the form of the RLC SDU is transmitted to the RLC, the RLC entity can<br><br>
reconibine the TCP packet within a specific size allowed by a lower layer (i.e., MAC layer)<br>
and transmit the recombined TCP packet to a destination.<br>
Several RLC PDUs generated by the above-mentioned recombination are transmitted<br>
to the reception end via the physical layer. However, if at least one RLC PDU corresponding<br>
to a single RLC SDU is not received in the reception end, the reception end informs the<br>
transmission end of RLC PDU non-reception. In this case, if the transmission end retransmits<br>
an entire RLC SDU associated with the lost RLC PDU, a large, amount of radio resources<br>
may be wasted.<br>
For example, the RLC SDU of 1500 bytes is divided into ten RLC PDUs, each of<br>
which has 150 bytes. If a single RLC PDU from among the 10 RLC PDUs is not correctly<br>
received in the reception end, the entire RLC SDU is retransmitted according to the above-<br>
mentioned situation. Accordingly, a data amount of 1400 bytes is unnecessarily wasted. In<br>
this case, there is a need to perform the retransmission at the RLC PDU level.<br>
Wireless environments provided when the RLC PDU is to be retransmitted may be<br>
different from those during initial transmission of the RLC PDU. For example, if the RLC<br>
PDU is initially transmitted, a corresponding RLC entity can transmit data of 200 bytes<br>
during a unit time. However, when the RLD PDU is retransmitted, a corresponding RLC<br>
entity may unexpectedly transmit data of only 50 bytes during the unit time. In this case, the<br>
RLC PDU cannot be retransmitted without change. Specifically, the RLC PDU having an<br>
original format cannot be retransmitted to a desired destination. In order to solve this<br>
problem, one embodiment of the present invention divides the original RLC PDU into several<br>
RLC subPDUs. Preferably, the present invention allows a transmission end to receive<br>
reception status information from the reception end after the transmission end transmits the<br>
RLC PDU. Thereafter, the transmission end performs retransmission according to the radio<br>
resources presently allocated to the transmission end.<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a method for transmitting signals of a mobile<br>
communication system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the transmission end transmits first data of fee RLC PDU to the reception<br>
end (S60). The reception end receives the first data and transmits the transmission/reception<br>
acknowledgment information (e.g., ACK/NACK. signals) of the RLC PDU and reception<br>
status information for the received first data (S61).<br>
If the first data is to be retransmitted, the transmission end determines which one of a<br>
plurality of RLC PDUs was not received by the reception end using the<br>
transmission/reception acknowledgment information, received from the reception end.<br>
Thereafter, the transmission end recognizes an amount of radio resources available for the<br>
retransmission (S62).<br>
If the RLC PDU can be retransmitted using the available amount of radio resources, the<br>
RLC PDU is retransmitted (S63). However, if the RLC PDU cannot be retransmitted using<br>
the available amount of radio resources, the RLC PDU is reconfigured in the form of two or<br>
more RLC subPDUs (S64), such that the RLC subPDUs can be transmitted using the<br>
available amount of radio resources (S65).<br>
In other words, if the RLC PDU data is required to be retransmitted, and an amount of<br>
radio resources allocated to the transmission end is less than the size of the initial RLC PDU,<br>
the transmission end reconfigures the RLC PDU in the form of two or more RLC subPDUs<br>
(S64), and transmits the RLC subPDUs to the reception end (S65). Preferably, each RLC<br>
entity configures a predetermined size of radio resources allocated by the lower layer.<br>
The amount of radio resources is indicative of a maximum amount of data capable of<br>
being transmitted from the transmission end. The transmission end also includes a<br>
transmission-end RLC.<br>
If there is a need to reconfigure the RLC PDU using scheduling information or other<br><br>
information loaded in the transmission/reception acknowledgment information, the RLC<br>
PDU is reconfigured in the form of two or more RLC subPDUs such that the RLC subPDUs<br>
can be transmitted to the reception end. The transmission end can also reconfigure the RLC<br>
PDU in the form of two or more RLC subPDUs on the condition that any one of the<br>
transmitted RLC PDUs does not arrive at the reception end.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the scheduling information or transmission/reception<br>
acknowledgment mfoimation received at the reception end from the transmission end<br>
indicates the size of the RLC subPDUs reconfigured by the transmission end. Preferably, the<br>
scheduling information is transmitted from the eNode-B to the UE for indicating which one<br>
of a plurality of UEs will use a predetermined size of radio resources during a predetermined<br>
time. Specifically, the scheduling information indicates size information of radio resources to<br>
be used by a determined UE, and time information to be used by the determined UE<br>
according to the radio resources having the size information.<br>
Preferably, the transmission/reception acknowledgment information is transmitted from<br>
the reception end to the transmission end for indicating the correct reception of one of a<br>
plurality of PDUs or SDUs at the reception end. The transmission/reception<br>
acknowledgment information also indicates the non-reception of one of the plurality of PDUs<br>
or SDUs at the reception end. The reception end recognizes whether a received data block is<br>
the RLC PDU or the RLC subPDU. If the reception end can not recognizes, the reception<br>
end reassembles an RLC SDU by binding non-related data in a single bundle. Otherwise, the<br>
order of data units contained in the single RLC SDU may be changed from an original order.<br>
In order to distinguish between the RLC PDU and the RLC subPDU, an additional<br>
field capable of discriminating between the RLC PDU and the RLC subPDU may be added to<br>
a header part of a data block communicated between the RLC and MAC  According to the<br>
value of the additional field, the RLC of the reception end can determine whether the data<br><br>
block received from the lower MAC layer is the RLC PDU or the RLC subPDU. In this way,<br>
when transmitting the data block to the lower MAC layer, the RLC entity of the transmission<br>
end determines whether its transmission, data is the RLC PDU or the RLC subPDU, and can<br>
properly establish a PDU/subPDU discriminator for the header part of the data block.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the RLC subPDUs will hereinafter be described with<br>
reference to the drawings. Notably, the following RLC subPDUs formats are not limited to<br>
the preferred embodiments of the present invention, and can also be applied to other<br>
examples as necessary.<br>
FIG 7 is a diagram illustrating a method for transmitting data of a mobile<br>
communication system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, a first block 70 includes three IP packets. Preferably, the three IP packets<br>
are considered RLC SDUs from the viewpoint of the RLC entity. Preferably, sizes of<br>
individual IP packets for use in one embodiment of the present invention are 500 bits, 600<br>
bits and 300 bits, respectively.<br>
A second block 71 indicates how to configure the RLC PDUs using the three IP packets.<br>
Here, it is assumed that the allowed sizes of the RLC PDUs under wireless environments at<br>
initial transmission are 300 bits, 400 bits and 700 bits, respectively. Moreover, an RLC PDU<br>
includes several header fields.<br>
A detailed description of individual header fields in accordance with the present<br>
invention is as follows. A Flow ID (Queue ID) field indicates which one of a plurality of RBs<br>
or which one of a plurality of RLC entities is associated with the RLC PDU. Indeed, a single<br>
UE includes several RBs having different QoSs and characteristics or several RLC entities<br>
having different QoSs and characteristics. Therefore, the Flow ID field discriminates an<br>
individual RB from other RBs.<br>
A Transmission Sequence Number (TSN) field helps rearrange or manage<br><br>
retransmission of the received RLC PDUs, Prefevably, theTSN value increases by a specific<br>
value "1" whenever a new RLC PDU is generated. Thus, the TSN indicates the order of<br>
individual RLC PDUs in a single RLC entity.<br>
A Length Indicator (LI) field indicates a boundary of an RLC SDU. Thus, if a single<br>
RLC PDU includes two RLC SDU parts, a reception end can properly separate between fee<br>
RLC SDUs using the boundary information of the RLC SDU.<br>
A third block 72 indicates how to reconfigure the RLC PDU in the form of RLC<br>
subPDUs. When a reception end informs a transmission end of non-reception of a specific<br>
RLC PDU using an ARQ operation, the transmission end is required to retransmit the RLC<br>
PDU. However, at a specific time at which the retransmission is required, an amount of radio<br>
resources available for use by a lgwer layer of the transmission end may be insufficient for<br>
transmitting the RLC PDU. Accordingly, it is preferable to divide the RLC PDU into RLC<br>
subPDUs, or reconfigure the RLC PDU in th« form of RLC subPDUs, such that the RLC<br>
subPDUs can be transmitted to the reception end using the available radio resources.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, a method for reconfiguring a second RLC PDU of the second<br>
block 71 in the form of a plurality of RLC subPDUs will hereinafter be described. Here, it is<br>
assumed that the amount of data capable of being transmitted during a unit time based on<br>
wireless environments when retransmitting from a lower end (or lower layer) is 100 bits, 200<br>
bits and 100 bits, respectively. Therefore, the RLC PDU to be retransmitted is configured in<br>
the form of RLC subPDUs to which 100 bits, 200 bits and 100 bits are sequentially assigned.<br>
Preferably, the transmission end informs the reception end of a transmission when<br>
transmitting the RLC PDU or RLC subPDUs. Thus, to distinguish the RLC subPDUs from<br>
the RLC PDU, the LI field having a specific value may be used. In FIG- 7, a special LI field<br>
is used during transmission of an RLC subPDU. Therefore, whenever the reception end<br>
receives the special LI field, the reception end determines that the received data block is an<br><br>
RLC subPDU, and performs operations accordingly.<br>
Generally, the reception end uses the LI field to determine the boundary of an RLC<br>
SDU. However, if the reception end receives a RLC PDU with a LI field set to specific<br>
value, the reception end regards the received RLC PDU as RLC SubPDU. In that case, to<br>
identify the original RLC PDU associated with the received RLC subPDU, theTSN field of<br>
the RLC subPDUs is set to the same value as the TSN field of the original RLC PDU.<br>
Therefore, the reception end can recognize location information of the received RLC<br>
subPDUs, associated RLC PDUs or associated RLC SDUs.<br>
Accordingly, if a single RLC PDU is divided into several RLC subPDUs, additional<br>
information is required in order for a reception end to determine the order of the received<br>
RLC subPDUs. Thus, a subPDU info field is preferably used for this purpose.<br>
The subPDU info field indicates whether a specific RLC subPDU is located at an end<br>
part of its associated RLC PDU and relative Igcation information of the specific RLC<br>
subPDU among associated RLC subPDUs. For example, referring to the third block 72 of<br>
FIG 7, the subPDU info field of the third RLC subPDU indicates that the particular RLC<br>
subPDU is a final RLC subPDU associated with the RLC PDU, and that the particular RLC<br>
subPDU is the third RLC subPDU among RLC subPDUs associated with the RLC PDU.<br>
Although the RLC subPDUs are retransmitted from the transmission end to the<br>
reception end as described above, the reception end may not correctly receive some parts of<br>
the RLC subPDUs. Accordingly, me RLC subPDUs may be further divided into lower data<br>
blocks. However, if the probability of losing all of the RLC PDU and associated RLC<br>
subPDUs is extremely low, it is preferable mat a RLC subPDU is not further divided.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a method for transmitting data of a mobile<br>
communication system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 8, a first block 80, a second block 81 and a third block 82 are structurally<br><br>
similar to the first, second and third block of FIG. 7. However, additional fields are depicted<br>
in FIG. 8.<br>
A subfraining indicator (S) field indicates that the received data block is RLC subPDU<br>
of an RLC PDU. Preferably, if the S field is set to "Y", then a corresponding data block is an<br>
RLC subPDU.<br>
A length extension indicator (LEX) field indicates whether a next field is an LI field or<br>
an RLC SDU. If the LEX field is set to "Y", then the next field is the LI field. A subPDU<br>
info field is used when a reception end rearranges the RLC subPDUs.<br>
FIG 9 is a diagram illustrating a method for transmitting data of a mobile<br>
communication system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a first block 90, a second block 91 and a third block 92 are structurally<br>
similar to the first, second and third block of FIGS. 7 and 8. However, additional fields are<br>
depicted in FIG. 9.<br>
A sequence number (SN) field indicates data flow of a corresponding RLC PDU or<br>
location information on a logical channel. A control/data/subframe (C/D/S) field indicates<br>
whether a corresponding RLC PDU is an ARQ RLC PDU for data transmission, an ARQ<br>
RLC control PDU for transmitting control information, or an ARQ RLC subPDU<br>
reconfigured when the ARQ RLC PDU is retransmitted.<br>
A complete/partial (C/P) field indicates whether a first data part of the PDU is equal to<br>
a first part of an associated SDU. The C/P field also indicates which one of a plurality of<br>
SDUs corresponds to an end of the RLC PDU. An exemplary case, wherein the C/P field<br>
comprises two bits is as follows.<br>
For example, if the value of the C/P field is "00", a beginning part of the PDU is equal<br>
to a beginning part of the SDU, and an end of the PDU is equal to an end of the SDU. If the<br>
value of the C/P field is "01", a beginning part of the PDU is equal to a beginning part of the<br><br>
SDU5 and an end of the PDU is not equal to an end of the SDU. If the value of the C/P field<br>
is "10", a beginning part of the PDU is not equal to a beginning part of the SDU, and an end<br>
of the PDU is equal an end of the SDU. If the value of the C/P Field is " 11", a beginning part<br>
of the PDU is not equal to a beginning part of the SDU, and an end of the PDU is not equal to<br>
an end of the SDU.<br>
A following (F) field indicates whether a next field is the LI field or data. The length,<br>
indicator (LI) field indicates a boundary of an SDU contained in the PDU. A subframe<br>
Sequence Number (sSN) field indicates location information of a specific subPDU from<br>
among a plurality of associated subPDUs. A remaining (RM) field indicates the presence or<br>
absence of associated subPDUs after the specific subPDU.<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a method for<br>
transmitting data of a mobile communication system. If a specific data block is to be<br>
retransmitted but sufficient radio resources for transmitting the data block are not provided,<br>
the present invention reconfigures the data block in order to transmit the data block using the<br>
available radio resources. Preferably, the present invention retransmits only what is necessary.<br>
Therefore, data transmission efficiency is increased and service disconnection time of a user<br>
or UE is reduced.<br>
Although the present invention is described in the context of mobile communication,<br>
the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication systems using mobile<br>
devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with wireless communication<br>
capabilities. Moreover, the use of certain terms to describe the present invention should not<br>
limit the scope of the present invention to certain type of wireless communication system,<br>
such as UMTS. The present invention is also applicable to other wireless communication<br>
systems using different air interfaces and/or physical layers, for example, TDMA. CDMA,<br>
FDMA, WCDMA, etc.<br><br>
The preferred embodiments may be implemented as a method, apparatus or article of<br>
manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software,<br>
firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The term "article of manufacture" as used<br>
herein refers to code or logic implemented in hardware logic {e.g., an integrated circuit chip,<br>
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA}, Application Specific. Integrated Circuit (ASiC),<br>
