FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of detecting mechanical faults in AC<br>
motor beforehand through spectral analysis of motor stator current.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Induction motors are used extensively in every industry. The electric motors and<br>
motor system (comprising of motor, bearings, gear arrangement, torque<br>
transmitting shaft) experience a wide range of electrical and mechanical faults.<br>
Particularly in metal rolling process electric motors experience a wide range of<br>
mechanical problems. Misalignment, be the most common problem, causes a<br>
decrease in motor efficiency, and misaligned machinery is more prone to failure<br>
due to increased loads on bearings, seals, and couplings. Misalignment is one of<br>
the common causes, which creates most of the mechanical faults and leads to<br>
motor vibration. 'Motor Vibration' is a common problem for metal roling<br>
application and can be extremely frustrating and hazardous and often result in<br>
imminent motor failure.<br><br>
Apart from this a poorly aligned machine and motor vibration can cost a steel<br>
industry 20% to 30% in process down time and poor quality of metal rolling. Motor<br>
fault prognosis is becoming indispensable in the field of metal rolling and other<br>
process areas due to increasing demand of motor system in production line and life<br>
forecasting of motors and predictive maintenance planning is essential for optimized<br>
production and quality maintenance.<br>
 A prior US Patent No. US 5995910 entitled "Method and system for synthesizing<br>
vibration data" discloses a teaching of a system for training a neural network to<br>
synthesize vibration data relating to the operation of a machine. The system<br>
includes a first sensor operatively coupleable to the machine, the first sensor<br>
adapted to obtain at least one vibration signal relating to the operation of the<br>
machine. The system further includes a second sensor operatively coupleable to a<br>
power lead of the machine, the second sensor adapted to obtain at least one current<br>
signal relating to the operation of a machine. Additionally, the system includes a<br>
neural network operatively coupleable to the second sensor, the neural network<br>
being trainable to generate at least one synthesized vibration signal from the current<br>
signal, wherein the synthesized vibration signal is substantially equivalent to the<br>
vibration signal obtained from the first sensor.<br><br>
The cited document have not mentioned regarding the detection of fault due to<br>
misalignment of motor during operation.<br><br><br><br>
A prior US Patent US 2005007096 entitled "System and method for proactive motor<br>
wellness diagnosis", discloses a teaching of a power meter or overload relay<br>
including a housing and a plurality of sensors configured to monitor operation of<br>
a motor. A processor disposed within the housing and configured to receive<br><br><br>
operational feedback from the plurality of sensor and proactively determine an<br>
operational wellness of the motor from the operational feedback.<br>
This prior patent is very silent in regard to fault detection due to misalignment of<br>
motor in operating condition.<br>
A prior US Patent No. US 5049815 entitled "Spectral analysis of Induction motor<br>
current to detect rotor faults with reduced false alarms", discloses a teaching of<br>
detection of Motor fault in an induction motor by analysis of a frequency spectrum<br>
of the current drawn by the motor under test, wherein success of the fault analysis<br>
requires an accurate determination of the fundamental frequency of the motor<br>
current and the motor slip frequency, method and apparatus are disclosed for<br>
determining the fundamental and slip frequency values solely from analysis of the<br>
motor current spectra.<br>
The cited document have not focused anything about the detection of fault due to<br>
misalignment of motor during operational condition.<br><br>
The present invention is aimed to remove the above difficulties of existing practice<br>
of maintaining AC motor health and life by early detection of motor misalignment.<br><br>
The present invention is mainly applicable in rolling mill area and other place where<br>
high rating motors are used.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a reliable warning system regarding<br>
the AC induction motors failure especially due to mechanical misalignments.<br><br>
According to another object the present invention provides an unsupervised<br>
induction motor fault detection method, which maximizes the detection accuracy<br>
by eliminating the dependence on expert-knowledge for deriving expert-system<br>
rules for fault finding using motor current signature analysis means.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an online fault diagnostic algorithm<br>
for identification of mechanical faults of induction motors by variable speed drive.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to provided wherein a new set of feature<br>
coefficients are extracted from spectral characteristics of stator current by<br>
modified "k-means" clustering algorithm.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a method of detecting AC motor<br>
misalignment faults through modified k-means clustering comprising the steps<br>
of: data acquisition by sensing single-phase current of a 3-phase motor through<br>
Hall Effect sensor on load condition, high speed digitizing the current signal,<br>
anti-aliasing the digitalized current signal near the nyquist frequency; feature<br>
extracting by estimating real-time DC level for current signal for each digitized<br>
frame using Fourier transform and substracting from the same to eliminate the<br><br>
shadowing of low frequency current components resulting Fourier spectrum<br>
reflecting the operating condition of the motor and forming a feature set; feature<br>
reductioning by removing less affecting small frequency peaks from the feature<br>
set using an adaptive cutoff and selecting time persistent large frequency peaks<br>
(spectrum fingerprint) corresponding to key components in deriving motor<br>
condition at any instant time; fault sensing in learning state by storing spectrum<br>
fingerprints; detecting anomalies in frequency components as fault causing<br>
component by comparison of real-time fingerprints with the cluster information<br>
from the data base; and reporting fault information in graphical and textual form<br>
on computer screen and taking correcting measures for healthy operation of AC<br>
motor for prolonged hours and at all possible load variation via applying expert<br>
knowledge in finding source of fault.<br>
The invention will be better understood by the following description with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawing in which<br>
Figure 1  represents the performance of the invention through four<br>
interconnected and integrated sections of the method.<br><br>
Figure 1a<br>
and 1b	show the test dates of stator DC current for healthy and<br>
faulty motor sampled at 1 KHz respectively.<br>
Figures 2a<br>
and 2b	show the frequency peaks datas for normalized Fourier<br>
Transform of DC corrected frame for Healthy and<br>
faulty induction motor respectively.<br>
1.	Data Acquisition: Hall effect sensor is used to sense single-phase<br>
current of a 3-phase, induction motor. High-speed digitization of the current<br>
signal (at 1KHz) is done using a 12-bit Advantech PCI-1713 card. Digitized signal<br>
is then anti-aliased using 3rd order butterworth filter near to the nyquist<br>
frequency.<br>
2.	Feature Extraction: Real-time DC level for current signal is estimated for<br>
each digitized frame using fourier transform (Eq.2) and subtracted from the<br>
same to eliminate the shadowing of low-frequency current components, which<br>
may appear during the low-speed operation of the motor.<br><br><br>
On this DC corrected frame, proposed method applies 50% overlapping with<br>
hanning window (Eq. 3), and re-computes Fourier transform Xf) Frequency peaks<br>
in this computed normalized Fourier spectrum reflects the operating condition of<br>
the motor and each such peak forms an element of the feature set where<br>
m=1, 2,.... number of frequency peaks detected in the normalized spectrum.<br><br>
3. Feature Reduction: Less affecting 'small' frequency peaks are removed<br>
from the feature set using an adaptive cutoff frequency. After adaptive<br>
thresholding only those 'large' frequency peaks are selected for further<br><br>
processing, which remains persistent for past 24.58 seconds. Such reduced<br>
'large and persistenf frequency peaks (that is frequency vs. magnitude)<br>
correspond to key components in deriving the motor condition at any instant of<br>
time. These frequency peaks are labeled as 'spectrum fingerprint' of motor<br>
current.<br>
4. Fault Sensing: This stage is operated in two states - learning state and<br>
detection state. During learning state, the system stores spectrum fingerprints<br>
for healthy operation of induction motor for prolonged hours and at all possitle<br>
load variations. Cluster information is saved to the database once sufficient<br>
learning is over.<br>
Proposed method, detects anomalies in frequency components by comparison of<br>
real-time fingerprints with the cluster information from the database during<br>
detection state. As claimed, anomalies in the motor current spectrum are<br>
detected without applying any fault-specific expert-knowledge.<br>
The fault information are reported in graphical and textual form on computer<br>
screen.<br><br>
The invention as narrated hereinabove is illustrated with exemplary test results<br>
as shown in Figures 1a and 1b. Figures 2a and 2b show the test datas of stator<br>
current for healthy and faulty motor (broken rotor bar) respectively as sampled<br>
at 1KHz and frames of 4096 samples are created and represent sampled data<br>
and the D.C. corrected frame.<br>
Feature set or frequency peaks for normalized Fourier transform of D.C.<br>
corrected frame is shown as circles in Figure 2a and Figure 2b. "Large'<br>
persistent peaks above adaptive threshold are extracted as 'spectrum<br>
fingerprint', as shown with stars inside circle in those figures.<br>
The invention as narrated herein should not be read and construed in a<br>
restrictive manner as various modifications, are possible within the scope and<br>
limit of the invention as defined and encampussed within the appended claims.<br><br>
