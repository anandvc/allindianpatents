				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to a molecular sieve having a chabazite-type<br>
structure;'its synthesis and its use-in the conversion of oxygenates, particularly-. methanol, to olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The conversion of oxygenates to olefins (OTO) is currently the<br>
subject of intense research because it has the potential for replacing the long<br>
standing steam  cracking technology that  is today the industry-standard for<br>
producing world scale quantities of ethylene and propylene.    The very large<br>
volumes involved suggest that substantia] economic incentives exist for alternate<br>
technologies that can deliver high throughputs of light olefins in a cost efficient -<br>
manner.    Whereas steam cracking relies on non-selective thermal reactions of<br>
naphtha range hydrocarbons at very high temperatures, OTO exploits catalytic and<br>
micro-architectural properties of acidic molecular sieves under milder temperature<br>
conditions to produce high yields of ethylene and propylene from methanol.<br>
[0003]	Current understanding of the OTO reactions suggests a complex<br>
sequence in which three major steps can be identified: (1) an induction period leading to the formation of an active carbon pool (alkyl-aromatics), (2) alkylation-dealkylation reactions of these active intermediates leading to products, and (3) a gradual build-up of condensed ring aromatics.   OTO is therefore an inherently transient chemical transformation in which the catalyst is in a continuous state of change.   The ability of the catalyst to maintain high olefin yields for prolonged periods of time relies on a delicate balance between the relative rates at which the above processes take place.  The formation of coke-like molecules is of singular importance  because  their  accumulation   interferes  with' the  desired   reaction sequence in a number of ways.    In particular, coke renders the carbon pool inactive, lowers the rates of diffusion of reactants and products, increases the potential for undesired secondary reactions and limits catalyst life. <br>
[0004]	Over the last two decades, many catalytic materials have been<br>
identified as being useful for carrying out the OTO reactions.    Crystalline<br>
molecular sieves are the preferred catalysts today because they simultaneously<br>
address the acidity and morphological requirements for the reactions. Particularly<br>
preferred materials are eight-membered ring aluminosilicates, such as those<br>
having the chabazite (CHA) framework type, as well as silicoaluminophosphates<br>
of the CHA structure, such as SAPO-34. These molecular sieves have cages that<br>
are sufficiently large to accommodate aromatic intermediates while still allowing<br>
the diffusional transport of reactants and products into and out of the crystals<br>
through regularly interconnected window apertures.    By complementing such<br>
morphological characteristics with appropriate levels of acid strength and acid<br>
density, working catalysts are produced. Extensive research in this area indicates<br>
that silicoaluminophosphates are currently more effective OTO catalysts than<br>
aluminosilicates. In particular, the control of the silica to alumina molar ratio is a<br>
key requirement for the use of aluminosilicates in OTO reactions.  Nevertheless,<br>
aluminosilicate zeolites continue to be explored for use in OTO and appear to<br>
have yet undiscovered potential.<br>
[0005]	Chabazite is a naturally occurring zeolite with the approximate<br>
formula CaeAli2Si24O72. Three synthetic forms of chabazite are described in<br>
"Zeolite Molecular Sieves", by D. W. Breck, published in 1973 by John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
three synthetic forms reported by Breck are Zeolite "K-G", described in J. Chem.<br>
Soc., p. 2822 (1956), Barrer et al; Zeolite D, described in British Patent No.<br>
868,846 (1961); and Zeolite R, described in U.S. Patent No. 3,030,181 (1962).<br>
[0006]	U.S. Patent No. 4,544,538, incorporated herein by reference,<br>
describes the synthesis of another synthetic form of chabazite, SSZ-13, using N-alkyl-3-quinuclidinol, N,N,N-tri-alkyl-l-adamantylammonium cations and/or N,N,N-trialkyl-exoaminonorbomane as a directing agent in a conventional OH" medium. According to the '538 patent, SSZ-13 typically has a silica to alumina molar ratio of 8 to 50 but it is stated that higher molar ratios can be obtained by varying the relative ratios of the reactants in the synthesis mixture and/or by<br>
 <br>
treating the zeolite with chelating agents or acids to remove aluminum from the zeolite lattice. The '538 patent also discloses that the crystallization of SSZ-13 can be accelerated and the formation of undesirable contaminants can be reduced by adding seeds of SSZ-13 to the synthesis mixture.<br>
[0007]	According   to   Published   International   Application   No.   WO<br>
00/06494, published February 10, 2000, a colloidal suspension of seeds of the LEV structure can be used to assist in the crystallization of a number of molecular sieve structures, including LEV, PER, MOR, ERI/OFF, MAZ, OFF, ZSM-57 and CHA. Examples of CHA materials are said to include chabazite and the phosphorous containing molecular sieves SAPO-34, ALPO-34, SAPO-37, ALPO-37 and metal containing derivatives thereof.<br>
[0008]	A silica crystalline molecular sieve having the CHA framework<br>
type	has	been	hydrothermally	synthesized	using<br>
N,N,N-trimethyladamantylammonium in hydroxide form as the structure-directing agent at nearly neutral pH in the presence of fluoride. See Diaz-Cabanas, M-J, Barrett, P. A., and Camblor, M. A. "Synthesis and Structure of Pure SiO2 Chabazite: the SiO2 Polymorph with the Lowest Framework Density", Chem. Commun. 1881 (1998).<br>
[0009]	More recently, an aluminosilicate with the CHA framework type<br>
and having a silica to alumina molar ratio in excess of 100, such as from 150 to 2000, has been synthesized in the presence of fluoride ions. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0176751, published September 18, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0010]	Existing methods for synthesizing high silica aluminosilicates and<br>
all silica molecular sieves with a CHA framework-type have tended to produce materials with a large crystal size. However, small crystal materials are often desirable for catalytic use, especially where a high catalyst surface area is important, such as the conversion of oxygenates to olefms.<br>
[0011]	U.S.  Patent No.  6,079,644,  incorporated  herein  by reference,<br>
describes a zeolite that is identified as SSZ-62 and that has a CHA framework-type and a crystal size of 0.5 micron or less. SSZ-62 is said to have a silica to<br>
 <br>
alumina molar ratio in excess of 10, such as in excess of 30, but the only synthesis example produces a material with a silica to alumina molar ratio of 22.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0031]	The present invention  relates to  a method  of synthesizing  a<br>
crystalline material, in particular a high silica zeolite, having a chabazite-type<br>
framework and to a small crystal form of this material.  In addition, the invention<br>
relates to the use of this material such as in a process for the conversion of<br>
oxygenates, particularly methanol, to olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene.<br>
[0032]	It is to be appreciated that molecular sieves are classified by the<br>
Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association according to the rules of the IUPAC Commission on Zeolite Nomenclature. According to this classification, framework-type zeolites and other crystalline microporous molecular sieves, for which a structure has been established, are assigned a three letter code and are described in the Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types, 5th edition, Elsevier, London, England (2001). Chabazite is one of the molecular sieves for which a structure has been established and is materials of this framework-type are designated as CHA.<br>
[0033]	In its calcined form, the high silica CHA-type molecular sieve<br>
produced by the method of the present invention has an X-ray diffraction pattern having the characteristic lines shown in Table 1 below: (Table Remove)<br>
<br>
[0034]	These X-ray diffraction data were collected with a Philips powder<br>
X-Ray Diffractometer, equipped with a scintillation detector with graphite monochromator, using copper K-alpha radiation. The diffraction data were recorded by step-scanning at 0.02 degrees of two-theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, and a counting time of 1 second for each step. The interplanar spacing, d's, were calculated in Angstrom units, and the relative intensities of the lines, (where I/I0 is one-hundredth of the intensity of the strongest line), above background were determined by integrating the peak intensities. It should be understood that diffraction data listed for this sample as single lines may consist of multiple overlapping lines which under certain conditions, such as differences in crystallographic changes, may appear as resolved or partially resolved lines. Typically, crystallographic changes can include minor changes in unit cell parameters and/or a change in crystal symmetry, without a change in the framework atom connectivities. These minor effects, including changes in relative intensities, can also occur as a result of differences in cation content, framework composition, nature and degree of pore filling, crystal size and shape, preferred orientation and thermal and/or hydrothermal history.<br>
[0035]	The CHA framework-type molecular sieve of the present invention<br>
has a composition, in its calcined and anhydrous form, involving the molar relationship:<br>
(n)X203:Y02,<br>
wherein X (if present) is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron, indium, gallium or a combination thereof, typically aluminum; Y is a tetravalent element, such as silicon, tin, titanium, germanium or a combination thereof, typically silicon; and n is from 0 to about 0.01, for example from about 0.0005 to about 0.007, such as from about 0.0008 to about 0.005. Where a halide-containing compound has been used in the synthesis of the material, the calcined form of the AEI framework-type crystalline material of the present invention is normally found to contain trace amounts, typically from about 1 to about 100 ppm, for example from about 5 to about 50 ppm, such as from about 10 to about 20 ppm, by weight of the halide, preferably fluoride.<br>
[0036]	In one embodiment, the CHA framework-type crystalline material<br>
of the present invention is substantially free of framework phosphorus.<br>
[0037]	Typically, the CHA framework-type crystalline material of the<br>
present invention is produced as crystals having an average diameter less than or equal to 4 micron, such as from about 0.5 to about 4 micron. Moreover, in some cases, particularly where the material is produced in the presence of colloidal LEV seeds, the CHA framework-type crystalline material of the present invention is produced as crystals having a twinned morphology.<br>
[0038]	In its as-synthesized form, the CHA framework-type molecular<br>
sieve of the present invention has a composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
(n)X2O3:YO2:(m)R:(x)F:z H2O,<br>
wherein X, Y and n are as defined in the preceding paragraph, R is at least one organic directing agent and wherein m ranges from about 0.01 to about 2, such as from about 0.1 to about 1, z ranges from about 0.5 to about 100, such as from about 2 to about 20 and x ranges from about 0 to about 2, such as from about 0.01 to about 1. The R and F components, which are associated with the material as a result of their presence during crystallization, are at least partly removed by post-<br>
crystallization methods hereinafter more particularly described. Typically, the as-synthesized CHA framework-type crystalline material of the present invention contains only low levels of alkali metal, generally such that the combined amount of any potassium and sodium is less than 50% of the X2C&gt;3 on a molar basis. For this reason, after removal of the organic directing agent (R), the material generally exhibits catalytic activity without a preliminary ion-exchange step to remove alkali metal cations.<br>
[0039]	To the extent desired and depending on the X2O3/YO2 molar ratio<br>
of the material, any cations in the as-synthesized CHA framework-type material<br>
can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in<br>
part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include<br>
metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g., ammonium ions, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which tailor the catalytic<br>
activity for certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. These include hydrogen,<br>
rare earth metals and metals of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, VA, IB, IIB, IIEB, F/B,<br>
VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements.<br>
|0040]	The CHA framework-type molecular sieve of the invention can be<br>
prepared from a reaction mixture containing a source of water, a source of an oxide of the tetravalent element Y, optionally a source of an oxide pf the trivalent element X, at least one organic directing agent (R) as described below, seeds of a molecular sieve having a framework-type other than CHA, and preferably an AEI framework-type material, and typically a halide or a halide-containing compound, such as a fluoride or a fluoride-containing compound, said reaction mixture having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, within the following ranges: (Table Remove)<br>
<br>
[0041]	Where the tetravalent element Y is silicon, suitable sources of<br>
silicon include silicates, e.g., tetraalkyl orthosilicates, fumed silica, such as Aerosil (available from Degussa), and aqueous colloidal suspensions of silica, for example that sold by E.I. du Pont de Nemours under the tradename Ludox. Where the trivalent element X is aluminum, suitable sources of aluminum include aluminum salts, especially water-soluble salts, such as aluminum nitrate, as well as hydrated aluminum oxides, such as boehmite and pseudoboehmite. Where the halide is fluoride, suitable sources of fluoride include hydrogen fluoride, although more benign sources of fluoride such as alkali metal fluorides and fluoride salts of the organic directing agent are preferred.<br>
[0042]	The organic directing agent R used herein conveniently comprises<br>
a multi-cyclic amine or ammonium compound. Conveniently, the multi-cyclic<br>
amine or ammonium compound comprises a tricyclic or tetracyclic amine or<br>
ammonium compound, such as an N-alkyl-3-quinuclidinol, an N,N,N-tri-alkyl-l-<br>
adamantylammonium compound, an N,N,N-trialkyl-exoaminonorbomane or a<br>
combination thereof, such as an N,N,N-trimethyl-l-adamantylammonium<br>
compound. Suitable compounds include hydroxides and salts, such as halides.<br>
[0043]	The amount of seeds employed can vary widely, but generally the<br>
reaction mixture comprises from about 0.1 ppm by weight to about 10,000 ppm by weight, such as from about 100 ppm by weight to about 5,000 by weight, of said seeds. The seeds comprise a material having a framework-type other than CHA, such as an LEV, OFF or AEI framework-type molecular sieve. The seeds may be added to the reaction mixture as a colloidal suspension in a liquid medium, such as water. The production of colloidal seed suspensions and their use in the synthesis of molecular sieves are disclosed in, for example, International Publication Nos. WO 00/06493 and WO 00/06494 published on February 10, 2000 and incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the seeds are of the AEI framework-type material and particularly a silicate or aluminosilicate of the AEI structure.<br>
[0044]	Conveniently, the reaction mixture has a pH of about 4 to about 14,<br>
such as about 4 to about 10, for example about 6 to about 8.<br>
|0045]	Crystallization  can  be  carried  out  at  either  static  or  stirred<br>
conditions in a suitable reactor vessel, such as for example, polypropylene jars or Teflon®-lined or stainless steel autoclaves, at a temperature of about 50°C to about 300°C, such as about 135°C to about 175°C, for a time sufficient for crystallization to occur. Formation of the crystalline product can take anywhere from around 30 minutes up to as much as 2 weeks, such as from about 45 minutes to about 240 hours, for example from about 1.0 to about 120 hours. The duration depends on the temperature employed, with higher temperatures typically requiring shorter hydrothermal treatments.<br>
[0046]	Typically, the crystalline product is formed in solution and can be<br>
recovered by standard means, such as by centrifugation or filtration.    The<br>
separated product can also be washed, recovered by centrifugation or filtration and<br>
dried. The resultant product is found to comprise particles with an average crystal<br>
size below 4 microns, such as below 2 microns and typically about 1 micron.<br>
[0047]	As a result of the crystallization process, the recovered crystalline<br>
product contains within its pores at least a portion of the organic directing agent<br>
used in the synthesis. In a preferred embodiment, activation is performed in such<br>
a manner that the organic directing agent is removed from the molecular sieve,<br>
leaving active catalytic sites within the microporous channels of the molecular<br>
sieve open for contact with a feedstock. The activation process is typically<br>
accomplished by calcining, or essentially heating the molecular sieve comprising<br>
the template at a temperature of from about 200°C to about 800°C. in the presence<br>
of an oxygen-containing gas. In some cases, it may be desirable to heat the<br>
molecular sieve in an environment having a low or zero oxygen concentration.<br>
This type of process can be used for partial or complete removal of the organic<br>
directing agent from the intracrystalline pore system. In other cases, particularly<br>
with smaller organic directing agents, complete or partial removal from the sieve<br>
can be accomplished by conventional desorption processes.<br>
[0048]	Once the CHA framework-type material of the invention has been<br>
synthesized, it can be formulated into a catalyst composition by combination with<br>
other materials, such as binders and/or matrix materials, that provide additional hardness or catalytic activity to the finished catalyst.<br>
[0049]	Materials which can be blended with the CHA framework-type<br>
material of the invention can be various inert or catalytically active materials. These materials include compositions such as kaolin and other clays, various forms of rare earth metals, other non-zeolite catalyst components, zeolite catalyst components, alumina or alumina sol, titania, zirconia, quartz, silica or silica sol, and mixtures thereof. These components are also effective in reducing overall catalyst cost, acting as a thermal sink to assist in heat shielding the catalyst during regeneration, densifying the catalyst and increasing catalyst strength. When blended with such components, the amount of zeolitic material contained in the final catalyst product ranges from 10 to 90 weight percent of the total catalyst, preferably 20 to 70 weight percent of the total catalyst.<br>
[0050]	The CHA framework-type crystalline material described herein can<br>
be used to dry gases and liquids; for selective molecular separation based on size and polar properties; as an ion-exchanger; as a chemical carrier; in gas chromatography; and as a catalyst in organic conversion reactions. Examples of suitable catalytic uses of the CHA framework-type crystalline material described herein include (a) hydrocracking of heavy petroleum residual feedstocks, cyclic stocks and other hydrocrackate charge stocks, normally in the presence of a hydrogenation component iselected from Groups 6 and 8 to 10 of the Periodic Table of Elements; (b) dewaxing, including isomerization dewaxing, to selectively remove straight chain paraffins from hydrocarbon feedstocks typically boiling above 177°C, including raffmates and lubricating oil basestocks; (c) catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks, such as naphthas, gas oils and residual oils, normally in the presence of a large pore cracking catalyst, such as zeoliteY; (d) oligomerization of straight and branched chain olefins having from about 2 to 21, preferably 2 to 5 carbon atoms, to produce medium to heavy olefins which are useful for both fuels, i.e., gasoline or a gasoline blending stock, and chemicals; (e) isomerization of olefins, particularly olefins having 4 to 6 carbon atoms, and especially normal butene to produce iso-olefins; (f) upgrading of lower alkanes,<br>
such as methane, to higher hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and benzene; (g) disproportionation of alkylaromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, to produce dialkylaromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylenes; (h) alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, with olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, to produce ethylbenzene and cumene; (i) isomerization of dialkylaromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylenes, (j) catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides and (k) synthesis of monoalkylamines and dialkylamines.<br>
[0051]	In particular, the CHA framework-type material described herein is<br>
useful in the catalytic conversion of oxygenates to one or more olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene. As used herein, the term "oxygenates" is defined to include, but is not necessarily limited to aliphatic alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonates, and the like), and also compounds containing hetero-atoms, such as, halides, mercaptans, sulfides, amines, and mixtures thereof. The aliphatic moiety will normally contain from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, such as from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms.<br>
[0052]	Representative oxygenates include lower straight chain or branched<br>
aliphatic alcohols, their unsaturated counterparts, and their nitrogen, halogen and sulfur analogues. Examples of suitable oxygenate compounds include methanol; ethanol; n-propanol; isopropanol; €4 - CIQ alcohols; methyl ethyl ether; dimethyl ether; diethyl ether; di-isopropyl ether; methyl mercaptan; methyl sulfide; methyl amine; ethyl mercaptan; di-ethyl sulfide; di-ethyl amine; ethyl chloride; formaldehyde; di-methy] carbonate; di-methyl ketone; acetic acid; n-alkyl amines, n-alkyl halides, n-alkyl sulfides having n-alkyl groups of comprising the range of from about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof. Particularly suitable oxygenate compounds are methanol, dimethyl ether, or mixtures thereof, most preferably methanol. As used herein, the term "oxygenate" designates only the organic material used as the feed. The total charge of feed to the reaction zone may contain additional compounds, such as diluents.<br>
[0053]	In   the   present   oxygenate   conversion   process,   a   feedstock<br>
comprising an organic oxygenate, optionally with one or more diluents, is<br>
contacted in the vapor phase in a reaction zone with a catalyst comprising the molecular sieve of the present invention at effective process conditions so as to produce the desired olefins. Alternatively, the process may be carried out in a liquid or a mixed vapor/liquid phase. When the process is carried out in the liquid phase or a mixed vapor/liquid phase, different conversion rates and selectivities of feedstock-to-product may result depending upon the catalyst and the reaction conditions.<br>
[0054]	When present,  the diluent(s) is generally non-reactive to  the<br>
feedstock or molecular sieve catalyst composition and is typically used to reduce the concentration of the oxygenate in the feedstock. Non-limiting examples of suitable diluents include helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, essentially non-reactive paraffins (especially alkanes such as methane, ethane, and propane), essentially non-reactive aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof. The most preferred diluents are water and nitrogen, with water being particularly preferred. Diluent(s) may comprise from about 1 mol % to about 99 mol % of the total feed mixture.<br>
[0055]	The temperature employed in the oxygenate conversion process<br>
may vary over a wide range, such as from about 200°C to about 1000°C, for<br>
example from about 250°C to about 800°C, including from about 250°C to about<br>
750 °C, conveniently from about 300°C to about 650°C, typically from about<br>
350°C to about 600°C and particularly from about 400°C to about 600°C.<br>
[0056]	Light  olefin  products  will  form,  although not  necessarily in<br>
optimum amounts, at a wide range of pressures, including but not limited to autogenous pressures and pressures in the range of from about 0.1 kPa to about 10 MPa. Conveniently, the pressure is in the range of from about 7 kPa to about 5 MPa, such as in the range of from about 50 kPa to about 1 MPa. The foregoing pressures are exclusive of diluent, if any is present, and refer to the partial pressure of the feedstock as it relates to oxygenate compounds and/or mixtures thereof. Lower and upper extremes of pressure may adversely affect selectivity, conversion, coking rate, and/or reaction rate; however, light olefins such as ethylene still may form.<br>
[0057]	The process should be continued for a period of time sufficient to<br>
produce the desired olefin products. The reaction time may vary from tenths of seconds to a number of hours. The reaction time is largely determined by the reaction temperature, the pressure, the catalyst selected, the weight hourly space velocity, the phase (liquid or vapor) and the selected process design characteristics.<br>
[0058]	A wide range of weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) for the<br>
feedstock will function in the present process. WHSV is defined as weight of feed (excluding diluent) per hour per weight of a total reaction volume of molecular sieve catalyst (excluding inerts and/or fillers). The WHSV generally should be in the range of from about 0.01 hr'1 to about 500 hr"1, such as in the range of from about 0.5 hr"1 to about 300 hr"1, for example in the range of from about 0.1 hr"1 to about 200 hr"1.<br>
[0059]	A practical embodiment of a reactor system for the oxygenate<br>
conversion process is a circulating fluid bed reactor with continuous regeneration, similar to a modem fluid catalytic cracker. Fixed beds are generally not preferred for the process because oxygenate to olefin conversion is a highly exothermic process which requires several stages with intercoolers or other cooling devices. The reaction also results in a high pressure drop due to the production of low pressure, low density gas.<br>
[0060]	Because the catalyst must be regenerated frequently, the reactor<br>
should allow easy removal of a portion of the catalyst to a regenerator, where the catalyst is subjected to a regeneration medium, such as a gas comprising oxygen, for example air, to burn off coke from the catalyst, which restores the catalyst activity. The conditions of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and residence time in the regenerator should be selected to achieve a coke content on regenerated catalyst of less than about 0.5 wt %. At least a portion of the regenerated catalyst should be returned to the reactor.<br>
[0061]	In one embodiment, the catalyst is pretreated with dimethyl ether, a<br>
C2-C4 aldehyde composition and/or a C^j-C? olefin composition to form an integrated hydrocarbon co-catalyst within the porous framework of the CHA<br>
framework-type molecular sieve prior to the catalyst being used to convert oxygenate to olefms. Desirably, the pretreatment is conducted at a temperature of at least 10°C, such as at least 25°C, for example at least 50°C, higher than the temperature used for the oxygenate reaction zone and is arranged to produce at least 0.1 wt%, such as at least lwt%, for example at least about 5wt% of the integrated hydrocarbon co-catalyst, based on total weight of the molecular sieve. Such preliminary treating to increase the carbon content of the molecular sieve is known as "pre-pooling" and is further described in U.S. Application Serial Nos. 10/712668, 10/712952 and 10/712953 all of which were filed November 12, 2003 and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0062]	The invention will now be more particularly described with<br>
reference to the following Examples and the accompanying drawings.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0063]	0.818 ml of a 23.5 mg/ml aqueous solution of A1(NO3)3-9H2O was<br>
added to 15.674 ml of a 0.5721 molar aqueous solution of N,N,N-trimethyl-l-adamantylammonium hydroxide (TMAA+ OH") followed by 4.00 ml of tetraethylorthosilicate. The resultant mixture was continuously stirred in a sealed container overnight at room temperature until all the tetraethylorthosilicate was completely hydrolyzed. To the resultant clear solution was added 0.390 ml of a 48wt% aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid which immediately resulted in the production of a slurry. This slurry was further homogenized by stirring and exposure to air for evaporation of water and ethanol until a thick slurry mixture was obtained. Extra water was further evaporated from the slurry mixture under static conditions to give 4650 mg of a dry gel solid having the following molar composition:<br>
SiO2: 0.00143A12O3: 0.5TMAA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O<br>
[0064]	The resultant solid was divided into 2 approximately equal parts.<br>
To one part was added with mechanical mixing 4mg (0.2wt% based on the dry gel solid) of a seeding material, AEI having a Si/Al atomic ratio of 8.9 and Si/Na atomic ratio of 26.4, whereas no seeds were added to the other part. Each solid<br>
was then transferred to a respective Teflon®-lined 5 ml pressure reactor and<br>
crystallized at 150°C for 65 hours under slow rotation (about 60 rpm). After<br>
cooling, each product was recovered by centrifuging, washed with distilled water,<br>
and dried at 100°C to give 598 mg of a white microcrystalline solid for the seeded<br>
synthesis and 701 mg of a white microcrystalline solid for the unseeded synthesis.<br>
[0065]	The as-synthesized products of the seeded and unseeded processes<br>
had the X-ray diffraction patterns shown in Figures l(a) and 2(a) respectively demonstrating that both products had a CHA structure. The silica to alumina molar ratio of each product was found to be about 700. The results of SEM analysis are shown in Figure 3(a) for the seeded synthesis and Figure 4(a) for the non-seeded synthesis. From these results it will be seen that the seeded synthesis gave a product with a substantially uniform particle size of about 1 micron and a cubic morphology, although some defects and irregular crystals were observed. However, the non-seeded system produced significantly larger particles, with a size up to 20 microns, as well as producing bimodal particle size distributions.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0066]	The process of Example 1 was repeated but with the amount of the<br>
23.5 mg/ml aqueous solution of A1(NO3)3'9H2O being decreased to 0.716 ml to give, after evaporation of water and ethanol, 4648 mg of a dry gel solid having the following molar composition:<br>
SiO2 : 0.00125A12O3 : 0.5TMA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O<br>
[0067]	After dividing the dry gel solid into 2 equal parts and adding<br>
0.2wt% of the AEI seeds to only one part, the solids were crystallized as in Example 1 to give, after washing and drying, 686 mg of a white microcrystalline solid for the seeded synthesis and 566 mg of a white microcrystalline solid for the unseeded synthesis.<br>
[0068]	The as-synthesized products of the seeded and unseeded processes<br>
had the X-ray diffraction patterns shown in Figures l(b) and 2(b) respectively demonstrating that both products had a CHA structure. The silica to alumina molar ratio of each product was found to be about 800. The results of SEM<br>
analysis are shown in Figure 3(b) for the seeded synthesis and Figure 4(b) for the non-seeded synthesis. Again it will be seen that the seeded synthesis gave a product with a substantially uniform particle size of about 1 micron and a cubic morphology, the non-seeded system produced significantly larger particles, with a size up to 20 microns.<br>
Examples 3 to 6<br>
[0069]	The process of Example 1 was repeated but with the amount of the<br>
23.5 mg/ml aqueous solution of A1(NO3)3-9H2O being decreased to 0.636 ml<br>
(Example 3), 0.572 ml (Example 4), 0.520 ml (Example 5) and 0.478 ml<br>
(Example 6) to give, after evaporation of water and ethanol, 4646 mg, 4646 mg<br>
4644 mg and 4644 mg, respectively, of dry gel solids having the following molar<br>
compositions:<br>
SiO2: 0.00111A12O3: 0.5TMA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O Example 3 SiO2: 0.001 OOA12O3: 0.5TMA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O Example 4 SiO2: 0.00091 A12O3: 0.5TMA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O Example 5 SiO2: 0.00083A12O3: 0.5TMA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O Example 6<br>
 <br>
[0070]<br>
 <br>
As before, each dry gel solid was divided into 2 equal parts and the<br>
 <br>
parts separately crystallized as described in Example 1 with only one of the parts containing 0.2wt% of the AEI seeds. The results of the syntheses are summarized in Table 2. (Table Remove)<br>
Table 2<br>
<br>
[0071]	X-ray diffraction patterns for the products of the seeded syntheses<br>
of Examples 3 to 6 are shown in Figures l(c) to l(f) respectively and for the products of the unseeded syntheses are shown in Figures 2(c) to 2(f) respectively. SEM results for the products of the seeded syntheses of Examples 3 to 6 are<br>
shown in Figures 3(c) to 3(f) respectively and for the products of the unseeded syntheses are shown in Figures 4(c) to 4(f) respectively.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0072]	The as-synthesized material from the seeded synthesis of Example<br>
1 was pressed to a pellet at 30000 psig (2.07x105 kPa) and then ground and sieved to between 80 and 125 /im. Two separate samples of the sized material were weighed between 21 and 22 mg and mixed separately with 90 mg of 100 fan silicon carbide. These mixtures were loaded into separate 1.9mm internal diameter tubes sealed at the bottom with a quartz frit. The tubes were sealed into heated reactor blocks and the catalysts were then calcined at 540°C under flowing air for 2 hours to effect organic template removal. The calcined catalysts were then subjected to a mixture of 85% methanol in N2 at 540°C, approximately 100 weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), and 40 psia (276 kPa) methanol partial pressure for 6 minutes. During the methanol reaction, the reactor effluents were collected and stored at timed intervals for analysis by gas chromatography. Following the methanol reaction the catalysts were subjected to a flow of 50% oxygen in nitrogen at 550°C for approximately 90 minutes to bum off deposited coke. The reactor effluents were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy with quantitation of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide to determine the amounts of coke deposition.<br>
[0073]	Selectivities to hydrocarbon products were calculated.  The values<br>
given below are averages of each individual selectivity over the entire reaction. Each value represents an average of the selectivities obtained from the two individual repeats. (Table Remove)<br>

Coke	2.7<br>
Example 8<br>
[0074]	The as-synthesized materials for both the seeded and unseeded<br>
preparations of Example 4 were individually pressed to pellets at 30000 psig<br>
(2.07x105 kPa) and then ground and sieved to between 80 and 125 /mi. Two<br>
separate samples of the sized material were weighed between 21 and 22 mg and<br>
mixed separately with 90 mg of 100 /im silicon carbide. These mixtures were<br>
loaded into separate 1.9mm internal diameter tubes sealed at the bottom with a<br>
quartz frit. The tubes were sealed into heated reactor blocks and the catalysts<br>
were then calcined at 540°C under flowing air for 2 hours to effect organic<br>
template removal. The calcined catalysts were then subjected to a mixture of 85%<br>
methanol in N2 at 540°C, approximately 100 weight hourly space velocity<br>
(WHSV), and 40 psia (276 kPa) methanol partial pressure for 6 minutes. During<br>
the methanol reaction, the reactor effluents were collected and stored at timed<br>
intervals for analysis by gas chromatography. Following the methanol reaction<br>
the catalysts were subjected to a flow of 50% oxygen in nitrogen at 550°C for<br>
approximately 90 minutes to burn off deposited coke. The reactor effluents were<br>
analyzed by infrared spectroscopy with quantitation of both carbon monoxide and<br>
carbon dioxide to determine the amounts of coke deposition.<br>
[0075]	Selectivities to hydrocarbon products were calculated for each<br>
reaction. The values given below are averages of each individual selectivity over the entire reaction. Each value represents an average of the selectivities obtained from the two individual repeats.<br>

Example 9<br>
[0076]	The process of Example 1 was repeated but with the amount of the<br>
reagents increased by a factor of 5. After evaporation of ethanol and most of the water, a colloidal suspension of LEV seeds prepared according to WO 00/06494, published February 10, 2000 (dry levynite content 11 wt%, Si/Al=7) in the amount of 0.2wt% LEV on the basis of dry gel was added with stirring. Upon further evaporation of water a dry gel solid was obtained having the following molar composition:<br>
SiO2 : (1/1200)A12O3 : 0.5TMA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O<br>
[0077]	The gel was divided into two equal portions, which were sealed<br>
into two 23 rnl Teflon-lined Parr bombs and then were heated to 185 °C for 65<br>
hours.  X-ray diffraction indicated that the solid product was pure chabazite, and<br>
elemental analysis showed that the chabazite had Si/Al atomic ratio of 228.<br>
[0078]	The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the resultant product<br>
is shown in Figure micrograph show that a majority of the high silica chabazite crystals were twinned.While the present invention has been described and illustrated by reference to particular embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention lends itself to variations not necessarily illustrated herein.
