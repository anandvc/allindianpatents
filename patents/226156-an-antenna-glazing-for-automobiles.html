				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an antenna glazing for automobiles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Document DE 198 32 228 C2 discloses an antenna glazing for automobiles<br>
possessing these characteristics, in which an electrically conducting cladding is<br>
used as antenna element. To decouple antenna signals originating from the<br>
cladding placed inside the glazing made in the guise of composite glazing a<br>
coupling electrode is coupled in the capacitive regime to said cladding. Said<br>
electrode is composed of a plurality of thin wires placed parallel to and some<br>
distance from one another, which are linked electrically at one end by means of<br>
a busbar or similar, and extend over the cladding starting from this connection.<br>
The dielectric intermediate layer of the capacitor thus formed is constituted by at<br>
least one adhesive layer of the composite.<br><br>
This form of construction of a coupling electrode offers, by comparison with prior<br>
embodiments comprising a narrow contact band applied by screen-printing or in<br>
the form of a sheet to one of the glazings of the composite, the big advantage<br>
that it is practically not seen in the fitted state. Almost inevitably, these coupling<br>
electrodes are in fact situated in the visual filed of the glazing in question which<br>
is installed, for example in the guise of windscreen, on an automobile with metal<br>
bodywork, since in such cases of use, it is necessary to part or cut the cladding,<br>
the whole way along the edge of the glazing, in order to avoid direct coupling of<br>
the antenna field with the bodywork (earthed). It is therefore not possible to<br>
provide said coupling electrode very near to the edge of said glazing where it<br>
might be optically hidden by the framework of the window.<br>
If wires of, for example, 10 to 100 urn in diameter are placed inside a composite<br>
glazing or on its surface, they inside a composite glazing or on its surface, they<br>
cannot be discerned as such under normal conditions, unless they are placed<br>
very short distances apart. If on the other hand their mutual separation is at<br>
least very nearly ten times their diameter, they may not be visible as such unless<br>
one looks at them from very near the glass glazing. With the known antenna<br>
glazing, it has been demonstrated that, compared with a plane coupling<br>
electrode, consisting for example of a band of metal sheet, the coupling capacity<br>
is, in the case of the embodiment in accordance with the invention, amply<br>
sufficient for the transmission of the signal of the antenna.<br><br>
Practical applications of the thin wires coupling electrode show, however, that<br>
with the wires connected at one end only, the desired transmission power is not<br>
always obtained. For optimal optical inlay, the number of wires and hence the<br>
total width of the electrode are kept as small as possible. Within the framework<br>
of industrial manufacture, the establishment of electrical contact of the whole set<br>
of wires with the common connection electrode (at the base of the antenna) may<br>
not however by fully achieved. In the final analysis, there is no reliable test<br>
procedure making it possible to test the operating capacitance of the coupling<br>
electrode before and/or after the manufacture of the composite forming the<br>
glazing. If manufacture has terminated, and if defective coupling is found<br>
thereafter, the whole pane has to be scrapped.<br>
One could contemplate lengthening the wires and allowing them to overhang on<br>
both sides, beyond the glazing, so that then a continuity check is possible. It<br>
would however still always be necessary to test each wire individually or its<br>
contact with the base of the antenna, so much so that a noticeable reduction in<br>
expenditure cannot be expected from this variant.<br>
Document DE 42 37 818 Al describes an antenna glazing for automobiles, on the<br>
surface of which is placed an antenna for radio signals in the form of a loop,<br>
made by screen-printing. Starting from a plane connection zone made in eth<br>
zone of the edge of the glazing, a strand of the loop penetrates the visual field of<br>
the glazing as far as the invention point, from which the other strand returns. Its<br><br>
free end forming the base of the antenna is surrounded, with a slot-shaped gap,<br>
by the plane starting zone of the first strand. This structure forms antenna<br>
proper and is not provided for capacitive coupling with a plane antenna<br>
structure.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The invention proposes to further refine from the point of view of security of<br>
operation an antenna glazing of the type of that described in document DE 198<br>
32 228 C2.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an antenna glazing for automobiles which exhibits<br>
the features of the invention. If instead simply of parallel wires terminating<br>
'blindly', the coupling electrode comprises at leas one thin wire two ends<br>
disposed in the zone at the edge of the glazing, a limitation of the conductivity<br>
through the absence of contact of a wire or of an end of a wire with a gather<br><br>
point is already avoided a priori. With customary test procedures, the continuity<br>
of the coupling electrode prefabricated or also already laid can be checked in a<br>
simple manner. From the industrial automation point of view, there is no need<br>
for any major reorganization to lay the wire on or in the composite glazing; it is<br>
possible to resort to the same means as those that are used in the case of the<br>
already known coupling electrode. In principle, the ends of the wire also be<br>
conducted to the outside, away from a composite forming the glazing, so that<br>
any contact problems can also be eliminated again on the completed glazing.<br>
It is also possible to conceive of the check in the fitted state, within the<br>
framework of a diagnostic device for the corresponding apparatus (selector of<br>
channels, radio, TV), so that with their diagnosis, it is possible at one and the<br>
same time to also check the operating capacitance of the antenna and of the<br>
corresponding functional elements, and especially of the coupling electrode and<br>
of its connections.<br>
It is true that, preferably, eth two ends of the wire will be joined in local<br>
proximity, and thus make the wire describe at least one simple loop. However<br>
this is not absolutely necessary- It also comes within the framework of the<br>
invention to place some distance apart, for example each at a corner of the<br>
glazing, the two ends situated on either side of a track. At least with a double<br>
fold, described by the wire. The number of portions of conductor forming the<br>
loop may in this case be odd, whereas it will be even in the case of external<br>
connections narrowly separated from the electrode loop.<br><br>
The folding, at least single folding, of the wire is necessary to give the coupling<br>
electrode a virtual surface (determined by the mutual separation of the parallel<br>
portions of wire), which is sufficient for the capacitive coupling.<br>
A coupling electrode in according with the invention may in principle also<br>
comprises more than one wire or more than one loop. It would be conceivable,<br>
for example, to provide two or more unipolar loops, nested one inside the other<br>
or disposed parallel to and alongside one another, even if preference should be<br>
given to the solution with one wire, on account of the smaller number of external<br>
contacts to be established.<br>
To establish the external contact of the coupling electrode, there is preferably<br>
provided an appropriate interface (multiple connector, flat conductor,<br>
male/female connector) at the edge of the glazing 1. Connections with the<br>
receiver apparatus (radio, selector of channels, TV, etc.) as well as with a<br>
voltage source of which we shall say more later are thus established, the glazing<br>
1 being fitted. Multipolar interfaces such as these constitute as such the state of<br>
the art (cf. For example DE-C 195 36 131) and consequently will not be<br>
explained in greater detail here. We shall make no further mention of the<br>
prevention measures, etc., that may be necessary, since they are customary for<br>
the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
With all these measures, the rate of scrap due to failures of contact in the<br>
coupling electrode of finished glazings is appreciably reduced as compared with<br>
the known antenna glazing, and after fitting of such a glazing into an checking<br>
function is still possible.<br>
The number of wires overlaid on the antenna in the form of a thin layer and<br>
hence the transmission power of the capacitor thus formed may be influenced<br>
depending on requirements by the laying of several loops inside a coupling<br>
electrode or simply by a simple or multiple fold of a loop taking a sinuous profile.<br>
The latter measure makes it possible to obtain a large surface coverage, without<br>
however losing the possibility of a simple check of continuity. As the case may<br>
be, it would be possible to form a single electrode according to the invention<br>
from several wires of the type described hereinabove.<br>
In the manner of the known coupling electrode, the loop or loops may be<br>
prefabricated on an adhesive sheet and be laid, with the latter, at the desired<br>
location on a rigid pane of the antenna glazing. This prefitting assembly may also<br>
be equipped with an appropriate interface for the external connections, the<br>
quality of whose contact may already be verified in advance.<br>
Within the framework of a fitting for diversity at the antenna glazing, for several<br>
coupling electrodes constructed in accordance with the invention, distributed<br>
around the rim of the glazing. In an advantageous manner, the connections of<br><br>
ends of several coupling electrodes (for example in the corners) may be joined<br>
on the edge of the glazing, in local proximity to one another, and contacted<br>
towards the outside with several poles, possibly with a common interface. This<br>
may simplify the manner of proceeding in the logistic circuit and also the fitting<br>
of the electrical connections of such a glazing.<br>
In an additional and no-obvious function, a coupling electrode according to the<br>
invention could, for example if it were placed in the resting zone of a windscreen<br>
wiper of an automobile glazing (windscreen and/or back window), be exposed to<br>
a supply voltage which may itself be superimposed on the voltage of the signal,<br>
and could, as required, serve as separately activatable heating element. In a<br>
case application if this kind, it is nevertheless advisable to take appropriate<br>
measures known per se to decouple the supply voltage and the HF signals,<br>
taking for example the form of interconnected coils.<br>
In principle, the invention may be applied not only to composite glazings, but<br>
also to monolithic glazings, in the case of which the electrically conducting<br>
cladding is placed on the surface pointing towards the cabin. In this case, the<br>
cladding preferably consists of conducting materials applied by pyrolysis, such as<br>
for example doped zinc oxide. Furthermore, the wire of the coupling electrode is<br>
embedded between dielectric sheets made from a transparent polymer. The<br>
sheet directed towards the electrically conducting cladding is preferably<br>
composed of an adhesive material or is provided with a layer of glue, with the<br>
aid of which coupling electrode is glued to the glass pane.<br><br>
However, the invention applies first and foremost to composite or laminated<br>
glass glazings. Consequently, it is described here with the aid of exemplary<br>
embodiments in respect of composite glass glazings. While motor vehicle<br>
windscreen glazings are almost exclusively composed of composite glass,<br>
composite glass is being increasingly used also for the back and side windows, so<br>
that antenna glazings of the invention are not fundamentally limited to<br>
windscreens, but quite obviously may be used for all the window panes of<br>
automobiles.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to figure 1, an antenna glazing 1 is furnished with an electrically<br>
conducting cladding 2 over the whole of the its surface, but which has<br>
nevertheless been parted away from the rim in the zone at the edge of the<br>
glazing 1 or has not been applied at all. A dashed line demarcates the outside<br>
edge of the cladding homogeneously covering the visual field of the glazing 1. At<br>
the periphery, over the whole of the outer rim of the glazing 1, an opaque edge<br>
strip 3, known per se, has also been provided, surrounding the visual field proper<br>
of the glazing 1. This edge strip 3 is in practice composed of an opaque ink, for<br>
example a curable screen - printing paste, and overlaps or covers on the one<br>
hand the customary adhesion-based fixation of such a glazing, and on the other<br>
hand, also the edge of the cladding 2. Here, it has however been drawn see-<br>
through for representational requirements.<br><br>
As already stated, such an antenna glazing 1 is glued to a collar, generally<br>
metallic, of bodywork, which has not been represented. The cladding, which may<br>
be used, alongside other functions (such as the heating of surfaces and/or<br>
isolation from infrared), as antenna, must terminate at least 20 mm before the<br>
outside edge of the glazing 1, so that it is not earthed with the bodywork<br>
considering the surface area / capacitance ratio. In the later case, it would not<br>
be able to conduct any signal voltage, or only an overly weak voltage.<br>
To link the cladding 2 to a receiver apparatus, there is provided a coupling<br>
electrode 4 consisting of a thin wire. To fabricate the coupling electrode 4, use is<br>
preferably made of a tungsten wire, in view of the advantageous ratio between<br>
small thickness of the wire and tensile strength. In this embodiment, the<br>
electrode extends along one of the lateral edges of the antenna glazing 1 and is<br>
covered surface-wise by the cladding 2, without, however, touching the latter.<br>
The electrode is therefore linked to the cladding in the capacitive regime at high<br>
frequency and at low impedance.<br>
Preferably, the coupling electrode 4 lies in the zone of the overlapping of the<br>
cladding 2 by the edge strip 3. It is then invisible to inspection from the glazing<br>
1. Optionally, if a complete inlay of the coupling electrode 4 with the aid of the<br>
edge strip 3 is not possible, the wire constituting the coupling electrode 4 can be<br>
darkened on the surface, to such an extent that it is practically invisible.<br>
Naturally, in variants (not represented) of the invention, the electrode may<br>
extend only partially along one of the edges of the glazing.<br><br>
The antenna glazing 1 is, in the manner known per se, a composite glazing with<br>
two rigid glass or plastic panes (see figures 4 and 5); mixed composites<br>
consisting of a glass and a plastic pane are quite obviously possible likewise. The<br>
cladding 2 and the coupling electrode 4 are placed inside the composite glazing,<br>
hence between the two rigid panes, but separated from one another galvanically,<br>
by a dielectric intermediate layer. It would quite obviously, in principle, be<br>
possible to use a galvanic coupling between the wire and the cladding, but there<br>
is no certainty that it could be done without defect and in a safe manner.<br>
Two free ends 4A and 4B of the coupling electrode 4 are conducted to the<br>
outside beyond the outside edge of the glazing 1.<br>
In a variant of the representation of figure la, the antenna glazing of the<br>
invention may also be furnished with several coupling electrodes (4'), which may<br>
extend for example along the second lateral edge and/or along the upper and/or<br>
lower longitudinal edge, and may also extend into the visual field and/or has also<br>
been represented as dashes. This sheet-like substrate constitutes a support or an<br>
intermediate support for the thin wire (4A', 4B') of the coupling electrode (4') and<br>
simplifies the deposition of the coupling electrode on the antenna glazing 1.<br>
Consequently, the contact zones lie directly at the edge of the antenna glazing 1<br>
and may be situated outside of the composite forming the glazing. The contacts<br>
finally established by soldering, pinching and/or gluing with conducting glues<br><br>
may subsequently be checked in an operation with the test current mentioned<br>
previously, as a consequence of which, unlike the case of the already known<br>
coupling electrode, repair is possible outside the composite of the glazing. As the<br>
case may be, it is even possible to replace the matching resistor 5 or (in case of<br>
variable production) to readjust it.<br>
The length of the thin wire forming the coupling electrode 4 determines the<br>
capacitance of the coupling capacitor and may be dimensioned from the<br>
standpoint of the least possible reduction; it should be at least 5 cm,<br>
approximately, and preferably from 10 to 30cm. Likewise, the number of parallel<br>
portions of wire is important in respect of the coupling capacity; an increase in<br>
the folds of the wire also makes it possible to boost the strength of the useful<br>
antenna signal.<br>
Figure 3 represents a variant of the coupling electrode 4, in which the two ends<br>
4A and 4B are conducted to two spaced apart points of the edge of the glazing<br>
1, outside the surface of the glazing. Of the antenna glazing 1, only an extract<br>
has been shown, for the sake of simplification, without indicating the cladding<br>
and the edge strip. Here, there is no problem in appreciating that the coupling<br>
electrode 4 is made with an odd number of portions of wire (five portions) with<br>
four folds of the continuous wire. Such a variant provided for by the invention<br>
may be advantageous, for example if the positions for the electrical connections<br>
predefined by the automobile manufacturer are not close to one another, as in<br>
figure 1, or if several antenna bases of different coupling electrodes, fitted for<br>
example at the corners, need to be joined.<br><br>
Figure 4 represented a partial sectional view of the glazing 1 of figure 1, near its<br>
lateral edge. Depicted therein is the glazing 1 composed of two rigid panes 11<br>
and 12 which are bonded together with the aid of an adhesive layer 13 to form a<br>
standard laminated or compound glazing. The outside surface of the glazing (in<br>
its fitted state) is at the top. Also depicted are the cladding 2 and the opaque<br>
edge strip 3, which are separated from one another by the electrically insulating<br>
adhesive layer 13. The cladding 2 terminates before the edge of the glazing 1, as<br>
already indicated in figure 1. The thin wire forming the electrode 4 rests on the<br>
edge strip 3, and is therefore not visible from the outside. This wire 4 is<br>
separated from the cladding 2 by the adhesive layer 13 also forming the<br>
dielectric of a capacitor. In the finished state of the glazing l, the wire of the<br>
coupling electrode 4 is practically integrated into the adhesive layer 13 which<br>
may be a thermoplastic sheet of for example polyvinyl butyral.<br>
According to figure 5, which shows a variant of figure 4, the only difference in<br>
the fact that the thin wire forming the electrode 4 does not rest in its entirely on<br>
the edge strip 3 but lies at least partially in the field of vision of the glazing 1<br>
surrounded by the edge strip 3.<br>
In the present invention, it goes without saying that the electrode 4 may also be<br>
disposed wholly in the field of vision of an antenna glazing.<br><br>
