				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tube plate for tube bundles in chemical<br>
reactors, petrochemical reactors, refinery reactors and heat exchangers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As is known, chemical reactors consist of containers with large dimensions, inside<br>
which chemical reactions take place at a high temperature and a high pressure.<br>
Inside their substantially cylindrical body, these chemical reactors generally have<br>
a plurality of tubes, or tube bundles, which can carry out various functions,<br>
including assisting heat exchange between the operating fluids.<br>
These tube bundles are installed and kept in an operative position by means of<br>
use of tube plates, which in some cases can have large dimensions.<br>
With particular reference to the state of the art, it can be noted that, at present,<br>
the tube plates are produced in a single piece, or alternatively in several pieces<br>
which are welded together and then finished, for example which are drilled<br>
and/or machined.<br>
However, these processing operations cause some significant technical problems<br>
which must be faced satisfactorily.<br>
Firstly, in order to carry out these processing operations, particular machine tools<br>
are necessary, which have large capacities, large useful dimensions, and high<br>
costs.<br>
In addition, the operations to be carried out for these purposes are such that<br>
they require processing times which are often too lengthy for present<br>
requirements.<br>
Other problems according to the known art are caused by deformations which<br>
are created in the tube plate, as a result of welding shrinkages, in particular in<br>
the case of joints which are fully welded.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to provide a tube plate for tube<br>
bundles for chemical reactors, which eliminates the above-described<br>
disadvantages.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a tube plate for tube<br>
bundles for chemical reactors, which can be produced quickly and economically.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a tube plate for tube<br>
bundles for chemical reactors, which is safe and reliable when it is installed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided tube plate for tube bundles in chemical reactors,<br>
petrochemical reactors, refinery reactors and heat exchangers, characterized by<br>
comprising a plurality of components with a semi-circular shape which is<br>
complementary to one another, in order to form the complete plate, wherein said<br>
components are produced separately and are connected to one another<br>
subsequently by means of mechanical joining members, in order to form said<br>
tube plate.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components<br>
which from the said tube plate are joined to one another by means of a plurality<br>
of mechanical connections, which engage the respective components with one<br>
another.<br>
Further characteristics of the tube plate for tube bundles of chemical reactors,<br>
according to the present invention, are defined in other claims attached to the<br>
present application.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the tube plate for tube bundles for<br>
chemical reactors, according to the present invention, will become more<br>
apparent from the following description of a typical embodiment, provided by<br>
way of non-limiting example, with reference to the accompanying schematic<br>
drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 represents in plan view a tube plate for tube bundles for chemical<br>
reactors, according to the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 represents, partially in cross-section, a detail of the system for<br>
connection between components of the tube plate in the preceding figure,<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
With particular reference to the aforementioned figures, the tube plate for tube<br>
bundles with larger sizes, according to the present invention, is indicated globally<br>
by the reference number 10.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated by way of example in the attached figures, the<br>
tube plate 10 has two components, 11 and 12, with a substantially semi-circular<br>
shape, which have previously been machined.<br>
It will be appreciated that, according to the present invention, perforated plates<br>
can be produced in several pieces or components, according to requirements and<br>
to the design dimensions, which are subsequently joined together by means of<br>
mechanical joints.<br>
Thus, a perforated plate with large dimensions is produced in several parts which<br>
are connected to one another.<br>
As briefly described hereinafter, the components of the tube plate, the number<br>
of which depends on the dimensions and the structural requirements, are<br>
processed until they are completed, and are then connected mechanically. In the<br>
example illustrated in the attached figures, the semi-circular components 11 and<br>
12 are joined to one another by means of a plurality of pins 15.<br>
The pins 15 are inserted in holes provided respectively in the component 12 and<br>
in a projecting portion 13 of the component 11.<br>
In fact, the component 11 has a projection 13 which is inserted in a.<br>
corresponding cavity 14 in the component 12.<br>
The connection of these components 11 and 12 is completed by means of<br>
welded connections 16, between the head of the pin 15 and the component 12,<br>
and by means of further welded connections 16' between the components 11<br>
and 12.<br>
However, in addition to the example described, in order to guarantee sealing,<br>
seals of any type can be used, or, alternatively, a welding seal can be produced<br>
on the mechanical connection parts (which can consist of braces, screws,<br>
wedges, cams etc.)<br>
As a result, the invention makes it possible to process separately and in parallel<br>
components with smaller dimensions, on machines with smaller dimensions and<br>
capacities.<br>
The description provided makes apparent the characteristics and technical<br>
advantages of the tube plate for tube bundles for chemical reactors, according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
The following considerations and concluding comments are now made, in order<br>
to define the said advantages more clearly and accurately.<br>
The invention avoids the need to use machine tools with large capacities and<br>
large useful dimensions, and the time for construction of the manufactured<br>
product is reduced.<br>
In addition, there is a drastic reduction in the problems of deformation caused by<br>
welding shrinkages, in the case of fully welded joints.<br>
The invention can be applied to chemical reactors, heat exchangers, and in<br>
general to tube-bundle type pressure devices.<br>
Finally, it is apparent that many other variations can be made to the tube plate<br>
or tube bundles for chemical reactors which is the subject of the present<br>
invention, without departing from the principles of novelty which are inherent in<br>
the inventive concept.<br>
It is also apparent that, in the practical implementation of the invention, any<br>
materials, dimensions and forms can be used according to requirements, and can<br>
be replaced by others which are technically equivalent.<br>
In fact, the same results could be obtained with different connection<br>
technologies, provided that the novelty of the inventive concepts contained in<br>
the present description is applied.<br>
The scope of the present invention is defined by the attached claims.<br>
