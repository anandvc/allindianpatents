DESCRIPTION<br>
Device to aid the unloading of support elements<br>
5        Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a device for unloading support elements,<br>
applicable to props for construction or falsework, of those formed by two<br>
telescopically coupled tubular elements, which aids the support element to<br>
uncouple quickly and easily from the formwork element or from the constructive<br>
10        element that it supports.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Props are vertical support elements whose height can be adjusted,<br>
normally used in construction, comprised of a vertical exterior base tube, known<br>
15 as the lower shaft, which has a support base at its lower end and an interior<br>
tube, or upper shaft, that is removable to a lesser or greater extent from the<br>
lower shaft to adapt the length of the prop to the distance between the surfaces<br>
or elements to be supported by the prop, such as formwork elements.<br>
The props are provided with fastening means that allow the position of<br>
20 the upper shaft to be fixed, once it has been extracted enough from the lower<br>
shaft (base tube). These means are normally comprised of a transversal pin<br>
that passes through the upper shaft and that at the same time rests on an<br>
adjusting nut with handles and attached to the thread that the upper end of the<br>
lower shaft has externally.<br>
25	When the structure that supports the prop on the site has acquired<br>
sufficient resistance, the prop is unloaded, i.e. the prop is uncoupled from the<br>
formwork element that it supports. To uncouple the prop it is very difficult to<br>
manually loosen the adjusting nut in the opposite direction to that of<br>
adjustment, since the pressure that the loaded prop is under hinders the turning<br>
30 of said nut with respect to the thread of the lower shaft. It is usual therefore, that<br>
the operator hits the nut handles with a hammer or similar, in the direction to<br>
loosen it, but this is often the cause of faults in the props. Therefore, to aid the<br>
unloading manoeuvre, devices are used for the rapid unloading of props.<br>
Devices are known to aid the unloading of support elements, such as<br>
35 props, based on parts connected to the upper end of said prop, wherein the<br>
upper edge has indentations that have a straight step,  determining an<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-2-<br>
appreciably horizontal area for the support of a transversal pin that passes<br>
through the upper shaft, this state corresponding to the operative or working<br>
position of the prop. The parts in question have a recess adjacent to the step,<br>
this recess being designed to receive the pin during the descent or fall thereof<br>
5 in the unloading position of the prop. This type of devices for aiding the<br>
unloading have the drawback that, due to an accident or a bad manoeuvre, the<br>
pin can move towards the edge of the step falling in the recess, which causes<br>
the unloading of the prop whilst in working position and the dangers that this<br>
involves. Also, to unload the prop, it is necessary to hit the pin strongly so that<br>
10 this falls into the recess, due to the lack of inclination of the surface wherein it is<br>
initially supported since if it were more inclined it would increase the risk of the<br>
pin accidentally falling in the recess.<br>
Another example of embodiment of a device to aid the unloading of<br>
props is disclosed in document ES 2140280, wherein it provides a sliding<br>
15 holder on the prop shaft, that is supported by the adjusting nut and which has<br>
two indentations diametrically opposite one other, each one having on one of its<br>
sides a sloping step, the bottom of the indentation being rounded, adapted to<br>
receive the prop pin. The device is complemented by another part, a sliding<br>
cylindrical device on the exterior of the prop shaft, which holds different<br>
20 diametrically opposite extensions, which can fit, for the operative position of the<br>
prop, in the holder indentations, preventing the accidental falling of the pin<br>
therein. Thus, to aid the unloading of the prop, it is necessary to elevate the<br>
cylindrical element, so that the extensions come away from the bottom of the<br>
indentations and therefore the pin can slip, due to gravity or being hit, in the<br>
25        sloping step until it penetrates the bottom of the indentations.<br>
In said device to aid the unloading of props, it is necessary to first<br>
position the holder, then put the pin through the upper shaft of the prop and<br>
keep this supported on the sloping step of the holder, until the complementary<br>
part has been positioned on top so that its extensions fit into the bottom of the<br>
30        holder indentations, which complicates the construction of the unit<br>
The lack of a device for unloading support elements such as props or<br>
falsework, that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing devices and that<br>
improves the speed and ease of the positioning thereof, is therefore evident.<br>
35        Explanation of the Invention<br>
The device for unloading support elements object of the invention, is<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-3-<br>
applicable to falsework or to props comprised of two tubular elements, a lower<br>
shaft and an upper shaft, telescopically coupled.<br>
In essence, the device for unloading support elements is characterised<br>
in that it has at least one essentially annular first body, provided with a through-<br>
5 hole adapted for the upper shaft of the support element to pass through, which<br>
can rest on said first body, and in that this first body rests on an intermediate<br>
unloading wedge, designed to directly or indirectly support the lower shaft of the<br>
support element, that slides thereon in a direction essentially perpendicular to<br>
the longitudinal axis, so that the sliding of the intermediate unloading wedge<br>
10 causes the first body and lower shaft to come closer together or further away<br>
and, therefore, a decrease or increase, respectively, in the total length of the<br>
support element.<br>
Preferably, the device has a second essentially angular body, designed<br>
to rest on the lower shaft, which can be coaxially coupled to the first body and<br>
15 provided with a through-hole adapted for the upper shaft of the support element<br>
to pass there through, the intermediate unloading wedge being positioned<br>
between both bodies, coupled together, able to slide with respect thereto, said<br>
sliding causing the two bodies to come closer together or further away in the<br>
direction of the support element axis.<br>
20	According to another characteristic of the invention, the intermediate<br>
unloading wedge has retaining means adapted to block its position with respect<br>
to the two bodies and thus fix a separation distance between said bodies,<br>
corresponding to the operative position of the support element, so that when<br>
the position is unblocked, the separation distance between both is reduced, and<br>
25        the support element returns to an inoperative position.<br>
According to another characteristic of the device to aid the unloading of<br>
support elements, each one of the essentially annular bodies has a<br>
diametrically opposite first projection and a second projection, that originating<br>
from the internal base of the annular body, extend perpendicularly thereto in<br>
30 equal proportions, their opposite internal faces forming different cylindrical<br>
surfaces coaxial with the one with the through-hole, the exterior edge of each<br>
projection having the respective and corresponding transversal protuberance,<br>
cantilevered, underneath which there is a corresponding cavity, all of this<br>
adapted so that, once both bodies are coupled, the transversal protuberances<br>
35 can simultaneously fit into the respective cavities of the other body, which have<br>
bases, made on the internal face of each annular body, adapted to receive the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-4-<br>
support of the projection from the other body and the corresponding transversal<br>
protuberance, as both bodies are capable of moving axiaily between<br>
themselves, abandoning the support in said bases when the device passes<br>
from the inoperative position to the operative position.<br>
5	According to another aspect of the invention, the bases have vertical<br>
end stop portions, adapted to limit-the mutual turning of the first body and of the<br>
second body when they are coupled.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the intermediate<br>
unloading wedge consists of an annular flattened oblong body, with two<br>
10 straight, longitudinal and parallel sides and two arched end portions, said<br>
parallel sides being decreasing quadrangular sections, so that the straight<br>
sides have their upper and/or lower faces forming a wedge.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the annular bodies have on the<br>
opposite faces, when both bodies are coupled with an interposition of the<br>
15 intermediate unloading wedge, a sloping exterior surrounding surface<br>
corresponding to the upper and lower faces of the straight sides of the<br>
intermediate unloading wedge.<br>
According to another feature of the invention the vertical stop portions of<br>
each body are respectively coplanar with the surfaces of the opposite interior<br>
20        faces of the straight sides of the intermediate unloading wedge.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the first projection<br>
and second projection of each annular body have respectively, in the sides<br>
opposite the transversal protuberances, a first and a second bevelled surface<br>
parallel to the surfaces of the opposite interior faces of the two straight sides of<br>
25 the intermediate unloading wedge, so that said bevelled surfaces have guide<br>
devices for the intermediate unloading wedge when this slides between the two<br>
annular bodies, at the same time that said bevelled surfaces of the same body<br>
are guided by the vertical end stop portions of the bases of the other annular<br>
body to which it is attached.<br>
30	According to another characteristic of the invention, at least the first<br>
projection of each annular body is included in the opposite face of the face with<br>
the transversal protuberance of a third bevelled surface, which is attached to<br>
the first bevelled surface.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, one of the arched ends of<br>
35 the intermediate unloading wedge has a peripheral groove whose ends<br>
coincide with two through-holes made in the straight sides of the intermediate<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-5-<br>
unloading wedge.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the retaining means<br>
are positioned in the peripheral groove on the intermediate unloading wedge.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the retaining means are<br>
5        made of a retention spring that is comprised of an arched portion, adapted to be<br>
positioned in the peripheral groove of the intermediate unloading wedge, and<br>
some ends that are folded inwards, which are designed to fit into the through-<br>
holes of the intermediate unloading wedge.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, in the operative<br>
10        position of the support element the third bevelled surfaces of the first<br>
projections of each annular body are  comprised of non-return means for the<br>
retaining means of the intermediate unloading wedge, so that you can only<br>
unblock said operative position by applying force perpendicularly on the exterior<br>
face of the arched end portion of the intermediate unloading wedge with a<br>
15        peripheral groove capable of overcoming the retention force that the retaining<br>
means exert.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the arched end<br>
portion of the intermediate unloading wedge with a peripheral groove has a<br>
widened surface which is adapted to receive the application of a force in a<br>
20        direction essentially perpendicular to the support element.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
10	Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a section of the support element, in the<br>
example of the drawing a prop, with the device to aid unloading 1 of the support<br>
elements object of the invention, in operative position.<br>
The prop represented is basically comprised of two telescopically<br>
coupled tubular elements, known as lower shaft 5 and upper shaft 6. The lower<br>
15 shaft 5 is a vertical exterior base tube, which has a support base at its lower<br>
end, not shown on the drawing, and which has a thread at its upper end. This<br>
thread is connected to the interior thread of an adjusting nut 29.<br>
The upper shaft 6 is an inner tube that can be removed to a varying<br>
degree  from  the  lower shaft 5  and  has  through-holes  39  distributed<br>
20 diametrically opposite throughout the length of said upper shaft 6. In general,<br>
the upper shaft 6 also has a support at its upper end, not represented in figure<br>
1, configured as a horizontal platform, whereby the prop supports the formwork<br>
elements or other constructive elements on construction sites that require<br>
provisional support.<br>
25	So that the prop enters in load, i.e. receives the load of the elements<br>
that it has to support, the length of the prop must be adjusted to the distance<br>
between said elements to be supported, the upper shaft 6 being extracted to a<br>
greater or lesser extent from the lower shaft 5. For this, the props are provided<br>
with fastening means that allow them to fix the position of the upper shaft 6<br>
30 once this has been removed axially to a sufficient degree from the lower shaft<br>
5. To adjust the length of the prop, a pin 28 is introduced transversally in one of<br>
the through-holes 39 of the upper shaft, so that the section extracted from the<br>
upper shaft 6 is as close as possible to the element to be supported by the<br>
prop. Once the pin 28 has been inserted, the latter is normally supported by<br>
35 gravity on the upper surface of the adjusting nut 29. Thus, you finish adjusting<br>
the length of the prop by turning the adjusting nut 29 by its handles 30 so that<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-7-<br>
the coupling by threads between the adjusting nut 29 and the upper end of the<br>
lower shaft 5 drags the pin 28 in its ascent and therefore also the upper shaft 6.<br>
When the upper end of the upper shaft 6 comes into contact with the<br>
element to be supported, it is said that the prop enters in load, i.e. it is in<br>
5        operative position. Once the concrete of the element to be supported has<br>
acquired sufficient resistance to be able to take down the formwork, the prop is<br>
unloaded, wherein the upper shaft 6 has to separate from the constructive<br>
element that it supports. So that the prop unloads and enters an inoperative<br>
position, devices are used to aid the unloading, that quickly cause the<br>
10 shortening of the length extracted from the upper shaft 6, subsequently aiding<br>
the turning of the adjusting nut in the opposite direction to the tightening, by<br>
subjecting the prop to the compression generated by the load that it supported<br>
previously.<br>
The terms operative position and inoperative position are applicable<br>
15 both to the prop and the device to aid the unloading 1 object of the invention.<br>
Operative position is understood to mean that position wherein the prop is<br>
loaded, and inoperative position when it is no longer loaded and it is free of the<br>
element that it supports.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 show that the device to aid the unloading 1 is positioned<br>
20 between the upper surface of the adjusting nut 29 and the pin 28, so that the<br>
device to aid the unloading receives by gravity the support thereof.<br>
The device to aid the unloading 1 of props shown in the drawings has a<br>
first body 2 and a second body 3 that are identical, essentially annular, and<br>
have a through-hole 7 adapted for the upper shaft 6 of the prop to pass through<br>
25 and which can be coaxially coupled. The device to aid the unloading 1 further<br>
comprises an intermediate unloading wedge 4, positioned between both bodies<br>
2 and 3 coupled together, that slides over the prop perpendicularly to its<br>
longitudinal axis.<br>
When the intermediate unloading wedge 4 slides between the first body<br>
30 2 and the second body 3, it causes said bodies to respectively come together<br>
and then move apart in the direction of the prop axis, therefore the distance<br>
between the two upper surfaces of the adjusting nut 29 and the pin 28 varies.<br>
The intermediate unloading wedge 4 has retaining means 8 adapted to block<br>
the unloading shaft in a certain position with respect to the two bodies 2 and 3<br>
35 and, therefore, fix the separation distance between said bodies, a position that<br>
corresponds to the operative position of the prop, so that when said position is<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-8-<br>
unblocked, the separation distance between the two bodies is reduced, and the<br>
prop returns to its original inoperative position wherein the reduction of the<br>
distance between the two bodies 2 and 3 is sufficient to allow the prop to<br>
unload and uncouple from the element that it supports.<br>
5	In Figs. 1 and 2, the device to aid the unloading 1 of props is in<br>
inoperative position. The operative position of the device to aid the unloading 1<br>
is shown in Fig. 6, wherein the prop is not shown. Comparing Figs. 2 and 6, you<br>
can see the difference in the separation distance between the first body 2 and<br>
the second body 3.<br>
10	Each one of the essentially annular bodies 2 and 3 has a first projection<br>
9 and a second projection 10 diametrically opposite one another that,<br>
originating from the internal base of the annular body, extend perpendicularly<br>
therefrom to an equal length, their opposite internal faces configuring cylindrical<br>
surfaces 32 coaxial with a through-hole 7.<br>
15	Furthermore, as you can see in Figs. 3 and 4, the exterior edge of each<br>
projection 9 and 10 has a corresponding and respective transversal<br>
protuberance 11 and 12, cantilevered, underneath which there is a<br>
corresponding cavity, so that, once both bodies 2 and 3 are joined together, the<br>
transversal protuberances 11 and 12 of a body simultaneously fit together fairly<br>
20 loosely in the respective cavities of the other body, and are supported by the<br>
bases 13 and 14 made in the internal face thereof, and vice versa. These bases<br>
13 and 14 of each body are adapted to receive the support of the projections 9<br>
and 10 and of the corresponding transversal protuberances 11 and 12 of the<br>
other body, and the bodies 2 and 3 are capable of moving axially between<br>
25 themselves, so that the projections 9 and 10 and the transversal protuberances<br>
11 and 12 leave the support of the bases 13 and 14 when the device passes<br>
from inoperative position to operative position.<br>
Fig. 8 represents the device to aid the unloading 1 of props in operative<br>
position. In said Fig. 8 you can see that between the transversal protuberances<br>
30 11 and 12 of the first body 2 and the second body 3, there are no separations<br>
preventing, when knocking against each other, that the bodies 2 and 3 keep<br>
separating axially from one another. Equally you can see that in operative<br>
position, the bases 13 and 14 do not have the support of the ends of each<br>
projection 9 and 10 and of their respective transversal protuberances 11 and<br>
<br>
35        12.<br>
On the other hand, the bases 13 and 14 have vertical parts 19 and 20 of<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCTYEP2005/009422<br>
-9-<br>
end stops, adapted to limit the mutual turning of the bodies 2 and 3 when<br>
coupled. Thus, once the upper shaft 6 of the prop has been inserted in the<br>
through-hole 7, there is no way that the first body 2, the second body 3 and the<br>
intermediate unloading wedge 4 can become uncoupled.<br>
5	Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the intermediate unloading wedge 4. The<br>
intermediate unloading wedge 4 is a flat, oblong, annular body, with two<br>
straight, longitudinal and parallel sides 34, and has two arched ends 25. The<br>
straight sides 34 are of a decreasing quadrangular section, so that its upper 17<br>
and lower 18 faces form a wedge, as you can see in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
10	On the other hand, the first body 2 and the second body 3 are provided<br>
with on the opposite sides, when both bodies are coupled and interposed by<br>
the intermediate unloading wedge 4, a surrounding exterior surface 35, sloping<br>
in correspondence to the upper 17 and lower 18 faces 17 of the straight sides<br>
34 of the intermediate unloading wedge 4. It should be noted that, naturally,<br>
15 both faces 17 and 18 can slope with respect the horizontal, as shown in the<br>
drawings, or that, optionally, only one of them could be sloping.<br>
Fig. 3 further shows that the vertical stop portions 19 and 20 of each<br>
body 2 and 3 are respectively coplanar with the surfaces of the opposite interior<br>
faces 15 and 16 of the straight sides 34 of the intermediate unloading wedge 4,<br>
20        not shown in said Fig. 3.<br>
Furthermore, the first projection 9 and the second projection 10 of each<br>
body 2 and 3 have, on the opposite sides to the faces with the transversal<br>
protuberances 11 and 12, first and second bevelled surfaces 26 and 27 parallel<br>
to the surfaces of the interior opposite faces 15 and 16 of the straight sides 34<br>
25 of the intermediate unloading wedge. The first and second bevelled surfaces 26<br>
and 27 comprise guide means for the intermediate unloading wedge 4 when<br>
the latter slides between the two bodies 2 and 3, at the same time as said<br>
bevelled surfaces in each body are guided, respectively, through the vertical<br>
portions 19 and 29 of the bases 13 and 14 of the other body to which it is<br>
30        coupled.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 show that one of the arched ends of the intermediate<br>
unloading wedge 4 has a peripheral groove 21 whose ends coincide with the<br>
through-holes 22 and 23 made in the straight sides 34 of the intermediate<br>
unloading wedge 4. Figs. 7, 8 and 9 also show that the retaining means 8 are<br>
35        housed in said peripheral groove 21.<br>
The retaining means 8 represented in the drawings are comprised of a<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-10-<br>
retention spring that has an arched portion 36 and ends that are folded inwards<br>
37,	as you can see in Fig. 10. The arched portion 36 is adapted so that it can<br>
be positioned in the peripheral groove 21 of the intermediate unloading wedge<br>
4, and the ends that are folded inward 37 are designed to fit in the through-<br>
5        holes 22 and 23 of the intermediate unloading wedge. This arrangement of the<br>
retaining means 8 is that which is shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9.<br>
In the operative position of the prop, third bevelled surfaces 24 of the<br>
first projections 9 of each annular body 2 and 3 comprise non-return means for<br>
the retaining means 8 of the intermediate unloading wedge 4, by retaining the<br>
10        ends that are folded inwards 37 in said operative position. Thus, the only way to<br>
unblock said operative position is by applying a force,  in an essentially<br>
perpendicular direction with respect to the exterior face of the arched end<br>
portion 25 of the intermediate unloading wedge 4 which has a peripheral<br>
groove 21, capable of overcoming the retention force that the retaining means 8<br>
15        exert.<br>
As you can see in Fig. 8, the arched end portion 25 of the intermediate<br>
unloading wedge 4, which has a peripheral groove 21, has a widened surface<br>
38.	This widened surface 38 is adapted to receive the application of the force in<br>
an essentially perpendicular direction to the axis of the prop, that allows the<br>
20        unblocking of the operative position of the prop.<br>
The functioning of the device to aid the unloading 1 of props is the<br>
following. Whilst adjusting the length of the prop so that the upper shaft 6<br>
comes into contact with the constructive element to be supported, the device to<br>
aid the unloading 1 must be in operative position. In this operative position, the<br>
25 separation distance between the first body 2 and the second body 3 is the<br>
maximum possible for its coupling, as shown in Fig. 3, since there is contact<br>
between the respective transversal protuberances 11 and 12 of the first and<br>
second projections 9 and 10. Getting the device object of the invention to adopt<br>
the operative position is done quickly and easily by moving the intermediate<br>
30 unloading wedge 4, from an inoperative position, in the direction that is<br>
indicated by the arrow of Fig. 6, until the ends that are folded inwards 37 of the<br>
retaining means 8 go over the third bevelled surfaces 24 of the first projections<br>
9, protruding from the through-hole 7 and therefore also the upper shaft 6 of the<br>
prop.<br>
35	To aid the unloading of the prop, it is only necessary to apply to the<br>
widened surface 38, as explained above, a force in an essentially perpendicular<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/032351	PCT/EP2005/009422<br>
-11-<br>
direction to the axis of the prop, e.g. by hitting with a hammer or similar on said<br>
widened surface 38, to move the intermediate unloading wedge 4 in the<br>
opposite direction to the previous.<br>
To go from the operative position to the inoperative one and vice versa,<br>
5 you must overcome in both cases the resistance of the retention spring to the<br>
increase in the separation distance between the ends that are folded inwards<br>
37. The slope of the third bevelled surface 24 of the first projection 9 of each<br>
body 2 and 3 and the cylindrical configuration of the exterior surface of said<br>
projection aid the transition from one position to the other, as long as you apply<br>
10 sufficient force overcome the retention force that the retaining means 8 exert.<br>
Thus, as you have to overcome the force applied at a certain threshold value,<br>
this stops the props unloading accidentally.<br>
The retaining means 8, that make sure that the intermediate unloading<br>
wedge 4 does not move accidentally, are particularly essential when the sloping<br>
15 of the wedge is not very marked, in which case the intermediate unloading shaft<br>
is sufficiently blocked, by the pressure of the annular bodies 2 and 3 against<br>
said wedge, when the prop, in the operative position, supports the work load.<br>
It should be mentioned that the second inferior body 3, could also be<br>
essential supporting, in this case, the intermediate unloading wedge 4 directly<br>
20 over the upper surface of the adjusting nut 29. Nevertheless, the direct contact<br>
of the intermediate unloading wedge 4 with the adjusting nut 29, especially<br>
when the prop goes from the operative position to the inoperative position, can<br>
cause a certain accelerated wear or cause faults with time, due to the forced<br>
friction, in the adjusting nut 29 or in the intermediate unloading wedge 4. The<br>
25 incorporation of the two annular bodies 2 and 3, that remain fixed with respect<br>
to the respective upper and lower shafts, resolves said drawback, since the<br>
intermediate unloading wedge 4 does not directly rest on any prop component.<br>
