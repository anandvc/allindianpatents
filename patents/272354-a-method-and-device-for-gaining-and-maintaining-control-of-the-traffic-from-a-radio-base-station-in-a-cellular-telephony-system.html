				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for letting a temporary radio base<br>
station gain and maintain control of traffic to and from a targeted radio base station in a<br>
wireless cellular telecommunications system. In the system in question, there are a number of<br>
radio base stations for controlling and routing traffic to and from user terminals in the system,<br>
and each radio base station routes and controls the traffic to and from a certain cell within the<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Many situations can be envisioned in which it is desirable for government bodies such as law<br>
enforcement agencies to prevent the use of cellular telephones within a certain geographical<br>
area. For example, during a situation of civil unrest such as riots, it may be desirable for the<br>
police or other similar government bodies to prevent the function of cellular telephones within<br>
a certain section of a city.<br>
Other cases where it may also be desirable to prevent the function of cellular networks in a<br>
defined geographical area might be, for example, before a police raid on a building. Another<br>
example of a problem area which could be addressed by area-selective prevention of cellular<br>
telephony is cellular telephones which have been smuggled into prisons, which is beginning<br>
to constitute a major problem.<br>
Traditionally, the prevention of cellular telephony within an area has been approached much<br>
in the same manner as traditional electronic warfare. This means that traditional solutions<br>
have been used which are mainly aimed at transmitting a jamming signal, usually noise, on<br>
the relevant frequencies, so as to "drown" the information in noise, and to thus create a signal-<br>
to-noise ratio which prevents the user terminals in the targeted area from detecting the<br>
"payload" signal.<br>
A problem with the technique described above, i.e. so called "brute force" jamming, is that<br>
this is a method which consumes a great deal of energy, thus making the equipment heavy and<br>
not very portable. In addition, since noise signals are transmitted with a relatively high output<br>
 <br>
power at well known frequencies, it can be quite easy for a skilled user to detect that the<br>
system is being tampered with.<br>
Document FR 2 858 742 describes a procedure and a device for tampering with cellular<br>
communications which addresses some of the problems described above. However, the device<br>
appears to need a great deal of processor power, since it relies on a rather complex algorithm,<br>
and tries to identify certain signals on a more or less constant basis.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
There is thus a need for a method and a device by means of which control can be gained of<br>
the cellular traffic in a certain area, without creating a large need for processor capacity and<br>
transmitter power. In addition, control of the traffic must not only be gained, but also<br>
maintained. The traffic which it is desired to gain and maintain control of is that between the<br>
user terminals in a certain area and the radio base station (RJBS) or stations which their traffic<br>
is controlled by and routed via.<br>
This need is met by the present invention in that it provides a method for letting a temporary<br>
radio base station gain and maintain control of the traffic to and from a targeted radio base<br>
station in a wireless cellular telecommunications system, where the system comprises a<br>
number of radio base station for routing traffic to and from user terminals in the system.<br>
Each radio base station in such a system controls the traffic to and from a certain cell within<br>
the system, and at least a number of the radio base stations in the system each transmits an<br>
identity signal and a list of candidate frequencies for use by user terminals when switching to<br>
another radio base station.<br>
The phrase "switching to another base station" refers to the fact that the user terminals in a<br>
cellular system will have their traffic controlled by and routed via a radio base station which<br>
fulfils certain criteria, among them signal strength. When the signal strength from the current<br>
radio base station falls below a certain pre-defined level for a certain pre-defined amount of<br>
time, a transfer of the traffic is made to another radio base station from which a clearer signal<br>
is received by the user terminal.<br>
 <br>
According to the invention, control of the traffic to and from the targeted radio base station is<br>
gained by positioning the temporary radio base station in or adjacent to the cell of the targeted<br>
radio base station, and programming the temporary radio base station to transmit on one of the<br>
frequencies in the candidate list broadcast by the targeted radio base station.<br>
Suitably but not necessarily, the frequency on which the temporary RBS is programmed to<br>
transmit on is a frequency used by an RBS which is not immediately adjacent to the cell of the<br>
targeted RBS.<br>
Thus, the temporary radio base station is made to transmit on a frequency which is monitored<br>
by the user terminals in the area in question, and with a power level which ensures transfer of<br>
the user terminal (-s) to the temporary radio base station from the targeted radio base station.<br>
In addition, the temporary radio base station is made to transmit as its identity signal a signal<br>
which is the same as the identity signal of the radio base station on whose frequency the<br>
temporary radio base station transmits on. Hence, control of the traffic of the targeted radio<br>
base station will be acquired by the temporary radio base station.<br>
In order to let the temporary radio base station not only gain but also maintain control of the<br>
traffic of the targeted radio base station, the temporary radio base station is programmed to<br>
transmit a list of candidate frequencies, but with the list being such that the user terminals<br>
cannot find signals with sufficient strength on any of the candidate frequencies in the vicinity<br>
of the take-over area. Accordingly, control of traffic which has been transferred to the<br>
temporary radio base station will also be maintained by it.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the list of candidate frequencies is made empty,<br>
which will mean that the candidate frequencies cannot be found by the radio base stations of<br>
which control has been gained, since the user terminals will in fact not look for candidate<br>
frequencies.<br>
The method of the invention can be applied to a number of cellular telephony systems, among<br>
which can be mentioned TDMA systems such as the GSM system, or to CDMA systems.<br>
If the invention is applied to a GSM system, the identity signal which will be used is the so<br>
called CGI-signal, or the BSIC signal (BSIC: Base Station Identity Code), and the list of<br>
 <br>
candidate frequencies will be the so called BA list. (BA: BCCH Allocation, where BCCH<br>
stands for Broadcast Control Channel.)<br>
Also, as opposed to prior art, no advanced algorithms or large amounts of processor power are<br>
needed in order to obtain the goals of the invention. In addition, the temporary base station of<br>
the invention can achieve the desired objectives in a much more energy efficient manner,<br>
which makes it possible to design a smaller and more compact device than previously, which<br>
can conceivably be battery powered. Also, as opposed to traditional jammers, which have<br>
used the "brute force" approach, the device of the invention does not cause as much<br>
interfering noise in the system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the following, with reference to the<br>
appended drawings, in which<br>
Fig 1 shows a part of a cellular system in which the invention may be applied, and<br>
Fig 2 shows a flowchart outlining some major steps of a method according to the invention,<br>
and<br>
Figs 3 and 4 show alternative steps for the flowchart of fig 2, and Fig 5 shows a system in<br>
which the invention is applied.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in closer detail, and use will be made of some<br>
examples of a cellular system in order to illustrate the inventive concept. The examples will<br>
mainly show the invention applied to a generic GSM system, in other words a system which is<br>
based on the TDMA principle, Time Division Multiple Access. However, it should be pointed<br>
out, and will be realized by those skilled in the art, that the invention can equally well be<br>
applied to cellular systems which are based on other principles, such as, for example, CDMA,<br>
Code Division Multiple Access.<br>
 <br>
Before the inventive concept is described, a brief description needs to be made of some<br>
functions in a cellular telephony system:<br>
Fig 1 shows the general layout of a wireless cellular system 100, or at least a part of such a<br>
system. As indicated in fig 1, the system comprises a plurality of separate and neighbouring<br>
geographical areas, so called "cells", exemplified by the cell denoted as 110. Within each cell<br>
there is usually one radio base station ("RBS") 120 which controls all traffic to and from user<br>
terminals 130 in the cell, and via which all traffic to and from the user terminals 130 in the<br>
cell 120 is routed. The user terminals in the system continuously monitor the quality of the<br>
received signal from the RBS which routes and controls their traffic, in order to determine<br>
when their traffic should instead be controlled by and routed via another RBS, in other words<br>
if a so called "hand-over" to another RBS should be performed.<br>
The signal quality as well as certain other predefined parameters are used when deciding if a<br>
hand-over should be made. The decision of making a hand-over can be made either by the<br>
user terminal 130 or by a so called Base Station Controller (BSC) at system level. Usually, the<br>
decision is made by a control function or control means in the user terminal if the user<br>
terminal is not engaged in an active session, i.e. when the terminal is in the so called "idle<br>
mode", and by the BSC if the user terminal is in the so called "active mode", i.e. there is a<br>
voice or data session in progress. In the latter case, i.e. during active mode, the user terminal<br>
reports the relevant data to the BSC, which will then decide if and when a hand-over should<br>
be made.<br>
Each cell in the system 100 has a globally unique identity within the system, in some systems<br>
such as GSM referred to as the CGI, the Cell Global Identity, which usually consists of 15 to<br>
18 bytes. Since the CGI comprises such a rather large number of bits, a shorter identity is<br>
often used by the radio base station in the cell, the shorter identity being referred to as the<br>
BSIC, Base Station Identity Code.<br>
The BSIC or the CGI are broadcast at frequent intervals by the radio base station 120 in the<br>
cell 110, so that the cell and its radio base station may be identified by the user terminals 130.<br>
The BSIC and/or the CGI are broadcast by the radio base stations on a special channel,<br>
usually a special logical channel. Also included in this broadcast is the so called BA list,<br>
 <br>
which is a list of frequencies used by radio base stations in the neighbourhood of the<br>
broadcasting radio base station.<br>
With reference to fig 1 and the cell 110, the BA list is thus used by the user terminals 130 in<br>
the cell 110 in order to know which other frequencies should be monitored for signal quality<br>
and possibly used in hand-over.<br>
In the case of the "passive mode", a hand-over will roughly take place as follows: a user<br>
terminal 130 in the cell 110 will listen to the broadcast message from the radio base station in<br>
the cell 110, and will monitor the frequencies in the BA list to see if they provide a better<br>
signal quality than the radio base station in the cell 110. If the answer is affirmative, and<br>
certain other criteria are fulfilled, such as for example the duration of the signal quality, the<br>
user terminal 130 switches its traffic to the radio base station with the better quality, and then<br>
starts to monitor the BA list of that radio base station.<br>
With reference to fig 1 and also to the flowchart in fig 2, an example of a method according to<br>
the invention will be shown. Imagine an area in which it is desired that no cellular telephony<br>
should be able to take place, for example a known hideout for criminals, which the police<br>
have decided to raid. It would be highly valuable to the police if no cellular calls could be<br>
made to or from the vicinity of the building prior to and during the raid. Control of all cellular<br>
telephony in the area in question is carried out by a regular RBS in the system, which RBS<br>
will thus be "targeted" for takeover of its traffic.<br>
In short, which will be elaborated upon later in this text, a method according to the invention<br>
utilizes an extra RBS, from now on referred to as a temporary RBS, in order to gain control of<br>
the traffic of the targeted RBS.<br>
In order to utilize the invention optimally, it is necessary to determine which frequencies that<br>
are in the candidate list, i.e. in a GSM system the BA list, of the targeted radio base station.<br>
This information can be obtained in a variety of ways, for example from the operator or<br>
operators of the cellular systems in that area, or by measurements carried out in the area in<br>
which it is desired to gain and maintain control of the traffic.<br>
 <br>
In addition to this, it is necessary to obtain the identity code of the station whose frequency<br>
the temporary radio base station will transmit on. This information can also be obtained either<br>
by measurements in the field, or from the operator of the system.<br>
It is also suitable to find out what the signal level is for the user terminals in the area in<br>
question, since it is desired for the temporary RBS to transmit with an output power level that<br>
makes the user terminals in the area to want to switch their traffic to the temporary RBS, but<br>
as an alternative this can be done by simply transmitting with an output level which it is a<br>
priori known that the targeted RBS cannot match.<br>
When the information which was described above has been obtained, it is used in the<br>
temporary RBS in the following way:<br>
•	The temporary RBS is positioned in the cell of the targeted RBS, or adjacent to said cell, see<br>
block 210 of fig 2.<br>
•	The temporary RBS is made to transmit on one of the frequencies in the candidate list of the<br>
targeted RBS, said frequency being used by an RBS which is suitably not immediately<br>
adjacent to the cell of the targeted RBS, see block 220 of fig 2. • The transmissions on said<br>
control frequency are made with such an output power level that user terminals within a<br>
certain area will perceive the signal from the temporary RBS as a signal of better quality than<br>
the targeted RBS, and will accordingly want to switch their traffic to the temporary RBS, see<br>
block 230 of fig 2.<br>
•	The temporary RBS transmits on its control channel an identity which is the same as that of<br>
the RBS whose control frequency is used, see block 240 of fig 2.<br>
Thus, by means of the steps outlined above, user terminals within a certain area will perceive<br>
a signal which is stronger than that of the targeted RBS, and since the received signal is one of<br>
those on the candidate list of the targeted RBS, they will perceive it as a regular "competing"<br>
signal, and will switch their traffic to the temporary RBS. When and if the BSC is notified of<br>
the measured signal strength by the user terminals, it will order them to switch their traffic to<br>
the temporary RBS for the same reason, i.e. that the temporary RBS will be perceived as an<br>
ordinary candidate for "hand-over".<br>
 <br>
These steps can be applied either to a GSM system, i.e. to a TDMA system, or to a CDMA<br>
system. As an example, if applied to a GSM system, the identity signal which is transmitted<br>
can be the so called CGI (Cell Global Identity) or the BSIC signals. This is outlined in fig 3.<br>
Thus, control has been gained of some or all of the traffic of the targeted RBS, depending on<br>
the output power which is used for the transmissions by the temporary RBS. The next issue is<br>
to ensure that control is also maintained by the temporary RBS, which can be done in the<br>
following way: the user terminals whose traffic has been transferred to the temporary RBS<br>
will, as explained previously, listen to frequencies comprised in the candidate list of their<br>
current RBS, i.e. in this case the temporary RBS.<br>
In order to maintain control of these user terminals the temporary RBS is, according to the<br>
invention, programmed to transmit a list of candidate frequencies, with the list being such that<br>
user terminals whose traffic has been transferred to the temporary RBS cannot find signals on<br>
any of the candidate frequencies in the vicinity of the cell of the targeted RBS, at least not<br>
with such a signal strength that they will appear as "attractive" candidates for a hand-over.<br>
Thus, there will be no "competing" frequencies to listen to, or at least to switch over to.<br>
One way of achieving such a candidate list is to make the candidate list empty, or, as an<br>
alternative, the candidate list can comprise frequencies of RBS's which are known to be so<br>
distant that they cannot compete with the temporary RBS. These two alternatives are shown in<br>
fig 4.<br>
This step of the invention can also be applied equally well to TDMA systems or CDMA<br>
systems. If applied to a GSM system, the candidate list will usually be the so called BA list.<br>
Thus, by means of the invention, control of traffic to and from a targeted RBS has been<br>
gained by the temporary RBS and will be maintained by it, which was the object of the<br>
invention.<br>
Returning now to the positioning of the temporary RBS and to its programming regarding the<br>
frequency it will transmit on to gain control of traffic from the targeted RBS, and also to its<br>
candidate list, reference is made to fig 5.<br>
 <br>
In fig 5, the wireless cellular telecommunications system of fig 1 is shown again, with the<br>
targeted RBS denoted as 120, and the cell it controls being denoted as 110. The temporary<br>
RBS of the invention has been given the reference number 140.<br>
As mentioned previously, the frequency which the temporary RBS 140 is made to transmit on<br>
is chosen from the candidate list of the targeted RBS 120. However, the frequency should not<br>
be chosen from one of those used by neighbouring cells or base stations, for examples the<br>
base station of the cell denoted as 157-159 in fig 5, since those base stations might provide the<br>
user terminals of the targeted RBS 120 with a strong signal.<br>
Instead, the temporary RBS 140 should be programmed to transmit on a frequency which is in<br>
the candidate list of the targeted RBS 120, but which belongs to an RBS which is as remote as<br>
possible from the targeted RBS 120 while still being in the candidate list of the targeted RBS<br>
120. The word "remote" in this context can be taken to mean either geographically or as an<br>
indicator of the strength of the signal from that RBS in the cell 110. One example of a suitable<br>
such radio base stations is the one denoted by 151 in fig 5. However, if made necessary, by<br>
for example, frequency planning and reuse, the temporary base station might have to<br>
"borrow" frequency and identity from a neighbouring RBS 157-159.<br>
The invention is not limited to the examples of embodiments shown in the drawings and<br>
described above, but may freely be varied within the scope of the appended claims.<br>

in the cell of the targeted RBS (120) will be transferred to the temporary RBS (140),<br>
-	it can be programmed to transmit an identity signal which is the same as that of the RBS<br>
(151) whose frequency the temporary RBS (140) transmits on,<br>
-	it can be programmed to transmit a list of candidate frequencies, the list being such that user<br>
terminals (130) whose traffic has been transferred to the temporary RBS (140) cannot find<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
signals with sufficient strength on any of the candidate frequencies in the vicinity of the cell<br>
of the targeted RBS (120).<br>
11.	The RBS (140) of claim 10, in which the list of candidate frequencies can be made empty,<br>
by virtue of which the candidate frequencies cannot be found.<br>
12.	The RBS (140) of claim 10 or 11 , being an RBS for use in a TDMA system.<br>
13.	The RBS (140) of claim 10 or 11 , being an RBS for use in a CDMA system.<br>
14.	The RBS (140) of claim 12, being an RBS for use in a GSM system.<br>
15.	The RBS (140) of claim 14, according to which the identity signal is the CGI.<br>
16.	The RBS (140) of claim 14, according to which the identity signal is the BSIC.<br>
17.	The RBS (140) of any of claims 14-16, according to which the list of candidate<br>
frequencies is the BA-list.<br>
 <br>
A method for letting a temporary radio base station (RBS, 140) gain and maintain control of<br>
the traffic of a targeted RBS (120) in a system (100), where RBS's transmit an identity signal<br>
and a list of candidate frequencies for use by user terminals when switching RBS. The<br>
temporary RBS (140) is positioned in or adjacent to the targeted RBS (120), and transmits on<br>
a frequency in the candidate list of the targeted RBS (120). The transmissions are at such a power level that the traffic of the targeted RBS (120) is transferred to the temporary RBS (140). The temporary RBS transmits the identity signal the RBS whose frequency the<br>
temporary RBS transmits on, and transmits a list of candidate frequencies such that user terminals whose traffic has been transferred to the temporary RBS cannot find signals with<br>
sufficient strength on any of the candidate frequencies.</td>
