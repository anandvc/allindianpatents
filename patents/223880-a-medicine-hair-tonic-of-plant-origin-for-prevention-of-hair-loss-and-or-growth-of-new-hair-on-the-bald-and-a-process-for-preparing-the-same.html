				<td>A medicine/hair tonic of plant origin for prevention of hair loss and/or for growth of new<br>
hair on the bald and a process for preparing the same.<br>
This invention relates to a remedy for preventing/curing hair toss and a medicine/hair<br>
tonic of plant origin for prevention of hair ioss and/or for growth of new hair on the bald<br>
irrespective of sex and a process for preparing the same. The medicine/tonic has also<br>
the property of removing/controlling dandruff. It also helps increase blood circulation of<br>
the scalp by which the nutrients we get from food supplied properly to the hair papilla<br>
increasing its capacity to generate the cell, follicle regeneration. It is immuno stimulant<br>
and also very relaxing which helps to generate sleep. It is also found to be memory<br>
stimulating. The invention also relates to the method of application of the medicine/tonic<br>
for curing/preventing baldness. The hairfall in medical term is called Alopecia. This<br>
medicine of the invention has been found to be effective in curing all types of Alopecia of<br>
wide age groups.<br>
It is normal that a healthy person either male or female to have sufficiently thick hair on<br>
his/her scalp. A good formation of hair and its maintenance is a sign of good health and<br>
adds beauty, charm and personality of a person. It is not uncommon to find people of<br>
either sex having sufficiently good/healthy hair even at advanced age. However, often it<br>
is seen that at least 30-40% of people of either sex particularly males to experience<br>
premature surprising hairfall without any apparent reason leading to near baldness to full<br>
baldness.<br>
To understand the hairfall one has to know what exactly is hair:<br>
1)	Mammalian Hair - Typical mammalian hair consists of the shaft, protruding above<br>
the skin, and the root, which is sunk in a follicle, or pit, beneath the skin surface. Except<br>
for a few growing cells at the base of the root, the hair is dead tissue and is composed of<br>
keratin and related proteins. The hair follicle is a tubelike pocket of the epidermis, that<br>
encloses a small section of the dermis at its base. Human hair is formed by rapid<br>
divisions of cells at the base of the follicle. As the cells are pushed upward from the<br>
follicle's base, they harden and undergo pigmentation.<br>
2)	Origin - By week 22 a developing fetus has all of its hair follicles formed. At this<br>
stage of life there are approximately 5 million hair follicles on the body. There are a total<br>
of 1 million on the head, with one hundred thousand of those follicles residing on the<br>
scalp. This is the largest number of hair follicles a human will ever have, we do not<br>
generate new hair follicles anytime in life. Most people will notice that the density of<br>
scalp hair will become less as they grow from childhood to adulthood by virtue of the fact<br>
that our scalps expand as we grow.<br>
3)	Anatomy - Hair has two separate structures - the follicle in the skin and the shaft we<br>
see<br>
Follicle - The follicle is a stocking-like structure that contains several layers with different<br>
jobs. At the base of the follicle is a projection formed like sticking a finger in the bottom<br>
of a stocking and pushing it in a small amount. This projection is called a papilla and it<br>
contains capillaries, or tiny blood vessels, that feed the cells. The living part of the hair is<br>
bottom part of the stocking surrounding the papilla called the bulb. This bottom part is<br><br>
the only part fed by the capillaries. The cells in the bulb divide every 23 to 72 hours,<br>
fas:er than any other cells in the body.<br>
The follicle is surrounded by two sheaths - an inner and outer sheath. These sheaths<br>
protect and mold the growing hair shaft. The inner sheath follows the hair shaft and ends<br>
below the opening of a sebaceous (oil) gland, and sometimes an apocrine (scent) gland.<br>
The outer sheath continues all the way up to the gland. A muscle called an erector pili<br>
muscle attaches below the gland to a fibrous layer around the outer sheath. When this<br>
muscle contracts, it causes the hair to stand up.<br>
The sebaceous gland is important because it produces sebum which is a natural<br>
conditioner. More sebum is produced after puberty. The sebum production decreases in<br>
women throughout their lives. The production also decreases in men, but not as much<br>
as in women.<br>
Shaft - The hair shaft is made up of dead, hard protein called keratin in three layers. The<br>
inner layer is called the medulla and may not be present. The next layer is the cortex<br>
and the outer layer is the cuticle. The cortex makes up the majority of the hair shaft. The<br>
cuticle is formed by tightly packed scales in an overlapping structure similar to roof<br>
shingles. Most hair conditioning products attempt to affect the cuticle. There are pigment<br>
cells that are distributed throughout the cortex and medulla giving the hair it's<br>
characteristic color.<br>
4)	Hair Growth Cycle - Hair on the scalp grows about .3-.4 mm/day or about 6 inches<br>
per year. Unlike other mammals, hair growth and loss is random and not seasonal or<br>
cyclic. At any given time, a random number of hairs will be in various stages of growth<br>
and shedding. There are three stages of hair growth: catagen, telogen, and anagen.<br>
Catagen - The catagen phase is a transitional stage and 3% of all hairs are in this phase<br>
at any time. This phase lasts for about 2-3 weeks. During this time growth stops and the<br>
outer root sheath shrinks and attaches to the root of the hair. This is the formation of<br>
what is known as a club hair.<br>
Telogen - Telogen is the resting phase and accounts for 10-15% of all hairs. This phase<br>
lasts for about 100 days for hairs on the scalp and much longer for hairs on the eyebrow,<br>
eyelash, arm and leg. During this phase the hair follicle is completely at rest and the club<br>
hair is completely formed. Pulling out a hair in this phase will reveal a solid, hard, dry,<br>
white material at the root. About 25-100 telogen hairs are shed normally each day.<br>
Anagen - Anagen is the active phase of the hair. The cells in the root of the hair are<br>
dividing rapidly. A new hair is formed and pushes the club hair up the follicle and<br>
eventually out. During this phase the hair grows about 1 cm every 28 days. Scalp hair<br>
stays in this active phase of growth for 2-6 years. Some people have difficulty growing<br>
their hair beyond a certain length because they have a short active phase of growth. On<br>
the other hand, people with very long hair have a long active phase of growth. The hair<br>
on the arms, legs, eyelashes, and eyebrows have a very short active growth phase of<br>
about 30-45 days explaining why they are so much shorter than scalp hair.<br>
5)	Hair Shape - The amount of natural curl a hair has is determined by its cross-<br>
sectional shape. Hair that is most similar to a circle is straight and hair that is flattened<br>
and elliptical is curly or kinky. The more circular the shaft is, the straighter it is. The more<br><br>
elliptical the shaft is, the curlier or kinkier the hair. The cross-sectional shape also<br>
determines the amount of shine the hair has. Straighter hair is shinier because sebum<br>
from the sebaceous gland can travel down the hair more easily. The kinkier the hair, the<br>
more difficulty the sebum has traveling down the hair, therefore the more dry or dull the<br>
hair looks.<br>
REASONS FOR HAIR LOSS:<br>
The general reasons for hair loss are as follows, probably in descending order.<br>
1)	NORMAL HAIR LOSS<br>
2)	HEREDITY FACTORS<br>
3)	POST SURGERY ALOPECIA<br>
.4)	HORMONAL IMBALANCE<br>
5)	DRUG INDUCED HAIR LOSS<br>
6)	PATCHY HAIR LOSS<br>
7)	DELA YED LOSS FROM STRESS<br>
8)	SUDDEN HAIR LOSS<br>
9)	BROKEN HAIRS<br>
10)	NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES<br>
11)	SELF INDUCED EFFLUVIUM OR TRICHOTILOMANIA<br>
12)	CONGENITAL ALOPECIA<br>
13)	OTHER HAIR LOSSES<br>
1) Normal Hair Loss - We all lose hair everyday. Hair grows for a period of time, usually<br>
2 to 6 years, and then the follicles shed the hair and go into a resting stage for<br>
approximately 3 months, then a new hair growth cycle begins. It is normal to lose<br>
between 50 to 150 hairs per day from normal shedding.<br>
2.) Heredity Factors - Androgenetic Alopecia is the scientific name for the genetic<br>
predisposition in both men and women for pattern baldness. Pattern hair loss in men is<br>
often referred to as male pattern baldness (MPB). Androgenetic alopecia is the cause of<br>
over 95% of all pattern hair loss, including baldness in men and thinning hair in women.<br>
Pattern hair loss occurs in somewhat predictable stages, and is relentlessly progressive.<br>
Usually the earlier in life pattern hair loss begins the more advanced the pattern will<br>
ultimately become. Studies have shown that pattern loss is increasingly evident and<br>
advanced as people age.<br>
Natural hair loss in a man, or male pattern baldness, as it is normally called is basically<br>
due to male hormones, (collectively known as Androgens). The most relevant of these<br>
hormones with regards to hair loss is called testosterone. In the case of a man who has<br>
inherited the necessary genes for hair loss, a little of this testosterone is formed by some<br>
of the hair roots into a derivative called Dihydrotestosterone. It is Dihydrotestosterone<br>
that is actually responsible for hair loss.<br>
When anyone washes their hair there are always a few hairs left in the basin afterwards.<br>
This does not necessarily mean that the person is thinning. All that is happening is that<br>
some of the hair roots are shedding their old hairs and, in time, these will be replaced.<br>
The new hairs are as strong as the previous hairs were. The small white bobble on the<br>
end of the hair is not the hair root; it is in fact, formed from degenerated cells from within<br><br>
the hair root and is called the club. If it were possible for a hair to be pulled from the<br>
scalp bringing a hair root with it then the scalp would actually bleed.<br>
If dihydrotestosterone has been produced it will be present in the surface sebum<br>
(grease) which is secreted by everyone from the sebum glands present through their<br>
skin tissue. Under these circumstances, when a hair is shed the dihydrotestosterone will<br>
enter the follicle (the hole in the scalp from which the hair has come) and inside there it<br>
reacts chemically. What it actually does is to miniaturise the hair root and follicle. This<br>
means that the new hair growing through will be finer. When this new fine hair is later<br>
shed the Dihydrotestosterone again miniaturises the follicle and hair root even further<br>
and hence the next hair will be finer still. This process will continue until the hair is so<br>
fine that it may as well not be there at all and if this happens over an area, then the man<br>
will obviously thin over that area and hence baldness occurs.<br>
3)	Post Surgery Alopecia - A number of things can cause excessive hair loss. For<br>
example, about 3 or 4 months after an illness or a major surgery, you may suddenly lose<br>
a large amount of hair. This hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is<br>
temporary<br>
4)	Hormonal Imbalance - Hormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland<br>
is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped<br>
by treatment of the thyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones,<br>
known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone<br>
imbalance may stop your hair loss.<br>
Many women notice hair loss about 3 months after they've had a baby. This loss is also<br>
related to hormones. During pregnancy, high levels of certain hormones cause the body<br>
to keep hair that would normally fall out. When the hormones return to pre-pregnancy<br>
levels, that hair falls out and the normal cycle of growth and loss starts again.<br>
5)	Drug Induced Hair Loss - Some medicines can cause hair loss. This type of hair<br>
loss improves when you stop taking the medicine. Medicines that can cause hair loss<br>
include blood thinners (also called anticoagulants), medicines used for gout, medicines<br>
used in chemotherapy to treat cancer, vitamin A (if too much is taken), birth control pills<br>
and antidepressants.<br>
Certain infections can cause hair loss. Children may have hair loss caused by a fungal<br>
infection of the scalp. Finally, hair loss may occur as part of an underlying disease, such<br>
as lupus or diabetes.<br>
6)	Patchy Hair Loss - Alopecia Areata is an immune system disorder, which causes<br>
hair follicles to stop producing hairs. Sudden loss of hair from small patches on the head<br>
is a common symptom. Advanced forms of the disorder include Alopecia Totalis, where<br>
all hair on the head is lost, and Alopecia Universalis, which results in the absence of all<br>
body hair.<br>
7) Delayed Loss from Stress - Telogen Effluvium is a slowing of new hair growth<br>
resulting from sudden severe stress, followed by a delayed shedding of hair. The stress<br>
induces a high proportion of follicles to enter the resting stage, and a few months after<br>
the stressful event, all of the resting follicles begin to shed hairs at about the same time.<br>
8) Sudden Hair Loss - Anagen Effluvium is the sudden loss of growing hairs as a<br>
result of chemicals or radiation. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation<br><br>
tnerapy halt the growth phase of hair follicles, and result in the sudden shedding of hair.<br>
Some medications (i.e.; diuretics, blood thinners, acne medications and birth control<br>
pills.) can also cause hair loss as a side effect.<br>
9)	Broken Hairs - Hair shaft breakage is when part of a hair breaks off, but the growing<br>
end remains in the follicle and continues to grow. Hair shaft breakage results in thinner<br>
hair, and can be caused by excessive styling, chemicals, sun, and chlorine in swimming<br>
pools.<br>
10)	Nutritional Deficiencies - Nutritional deficiencies are rarely a cause of hair loss. In<br>
rare cases certain nutritional deficiencies can cause weak hair shafts that tend to break<br>
off.<br>
11)	Self Induced Effluvium or Trichotilomania - Self induced effluvium occurs due to<br>
some irritation on the scalp on that affected area and he or she is unaware of pulling.<br>
This happens due to some irritation in the nerve endings of hair follicle. In some cases<br>
patients are also with psychiatric problem.<br>
12)	Congenital Alopecia - This type of alopecia occurs at the time of birth.<br>
13)	Other Hair Losses - Certain chronic illnesses can result in hair loss. Hormone-<br>
related irregularities can include hair loss among other symptoms. Skin infections can<br>
also result in hair loss that is usually not permanent. Trauma, such as burns and jury to<br>
hair follicles however, can cause permanent hair loss.<br>
It is the long experience of the inventors and also a common knowledge that many<br>
people have been suffering from hair loss at different ages particularly women at young<br>
ages due to disease or patchy hair losses which not only refrain them from their<br>
marriage but they experience social rejection, humiliation etc. leading to<br>
depression/frustration. Similar are the cases also for men. Thus, there is a genuine need<br>
for an effective remedy for curing such baldness or Alopecia.<br>
Prior art:<br>
The existing available remedies are:-<br>
i) Wig: It is a cover on the scalp with artificial hair. But looks odd and<br>
generation of sweat can develop growth of fungus on the scalp leading to<br>
various skin problems.<br>
ii) Hair transplantation: Hair from the back of the scalp with hair plug<br>
transplanted to the affected area. Patients not only look odd but the treatment<br>
is also painful and is very expensive.<br>
iii) Hydrocortisone injection: Steroid application on the affected area'which is<br>
also painful as well as having adverse side effects on the human body.<br><br>
iv) Minoxidyl: It is a topical application of a synthetic chemical, a powerful<br>
vasodilator only for men preferably between 18 to 46 years of age. The<br>
efficacy is very limited. The regained hair will be lost within a year if not<br>
continued. This does not cover all types of Alopecia. No dandruff remedy.<br>
The treatment is also quite expensive.<br>
v) Finasteride: This is an application of also a synthetic active ingredient<br>
Finasteride which interacts with hormone decease libido in 2% cases and<br>
regained after stopping. This is also recommended for only men of between<br>
18-42 years with slight hair loss. Regain of hair is about 30% in normal to<br>
moderate hair loss. Regained hair can be lost within a year if not used<br>
continuously. There is no proof of dandruff remedy also. This is also very<br>
expensive.<br>
From the above it can be seen that there is no effective remedy available in the art on<br>
the problem of hair loss/baldness in general.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to find a suitable medicine/tonic which<br>
can permanently prevent/cure baldness of either sex of long age groups which is cost<br>
effective, harmless and easy to use so that difficulties and sufferings of the people get<br>
alleviated or totally removed.<br>
The inventors having deep interest and long experience in the field of essential oils with<br>
their different amazing properties have successfully come out astonishingly with a<br>
remedy for treating the Alopecia or hair loss. They have so far treated more than 6,000<br>
patients of different conditions of Alopecia or hair loss and have evidence of very high<br>
success rate even in otherwise impossible cases.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a medicine/hair tonic of plant origin for<br>
prevention of hair loss and/or for growth of new hair on the bald for all types of Alopecia<br>
irrespective of sex comprising a mixture of essential oils of THYME (THYMUS<br>
VULGARIS), ROSEMARY (ROSEMARINAS OFFICINALIS), LAVEMDER (LAVENDULA<br>
OF FICINALIS),LEMON (CIRTUS LIMONUM), CEDARWOOD (CEDRUS ATLANTICA),<br>
and JATAMANSI (NARDOSTACHYS JATAMANST).<br>
The medicine should be used preferably with a carrier such as an oil, a gel or a<br>
shampoo. The carrier is preferably of plant origin and is selected from but not restricted<br>
to sunflower oil, olive oil, almond oil and jajoba oil or mixture thereof and also a gel like<br>
aloevera gel or a shampoo. The carrier oils can be alone or a mixture. The essential oils<br>
in the mixture are present in the following proportions:- 1:0.5-2:0.5-2:0.3-2:0.3-1.5:0.2-<br>
1.5 v/v respectively.<br>
The carrier and its proportion used for dilution of the main concentrated mixture of<br>
essential oils to be used as the medicine/hair tonic and the final dose are dependent on<br>
various factors including the condition of baldness, age, sex, background etc. of the<br>
patient. The ingredients used in this invention are readily available and are affordable.<br>
Preparation method:<br>
The medicine/hair tonic of the invention can be prepared by mixing the concentrate of<br>
essential oils of THYME (THYMUS VULGARIS), ROSEMARY (ROSEMARINAS<br><br>
OFFICINALIS), LAVENDER (LAVENDULA OFFICINALIS), LEMON (CITRUS<br>
LIMONUM), CEDARWOOD (CEDRUS ATLANTICA), and JATAMANSI<br>
(NARDOSTACHYS JATAMANSI) in the proportion of 1:0.5-2:0.5-2:0.3-2:0.3-1.5:0.2-1.5<br>
v/v respectively. The mixture then optionally diluted with the carrier as herein described<br>
the proportion of which can vary from 1 to 100 times depending upon the requirement of<br>
the patient.<br>
Method of application:<br>
The medicine in the diluted form is to be applied on the scalp as an external use only.<br>
[Example: Add 1-5ml of the concentrated form of the medicine in 100ml of carrier oil like<br>
sunflower oil, olive oil, almond oil, jajoba oil or a gel like aloevera gel or a shampoo. The<br>
same is thoroughly mixed to obtain a form of the medicine which is mostly found to have<br>
been very effective.<br>
Application method:<br>
As stated before, the medicine is to be applied externally over the scalp. 20 to 40 drops<br>
of the medicine are usually required by the patient once daily. The scalp is massaged<br>
gently for five minutes and then combed properly. Slight variation of dose will not create<br>
any problem. There is no side effect. The patients feel relaxed. After application of about<br>
1 month, definitive improvement in the growth of hair and restriction in the loss of hair<br>
can be noticed. The remedy is found most effective upto the age of about 72 years.<br>
Duration of the treatment can be of 1 month to upto 3 years.<br>
Case studies:<br>
As stated before, the applicants/inventors have treated more than 6,000 patients with<br>
excellent results. They have still been continuing the same The success rate is 100%<br>
Encouraging results after the treatment have attracted the media attention. The<br>
applicants/inventors have been periodically shown in live telecast in a local TV channe<br>
including the presence of the cured patients explaining the happy experience of the<br>
patients of the amazing treatment methods and the cure of their diseases. By these live<br>
TV programmes the applicants/inventors have also had interactions with various persons<br>
who became their patients and are getting treatment.<br>
