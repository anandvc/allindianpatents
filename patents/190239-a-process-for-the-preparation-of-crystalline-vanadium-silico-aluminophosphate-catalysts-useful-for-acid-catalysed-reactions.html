				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of crystalline vanadium-silico-alumino-phosphate catalysts useful for acid catalysed reactions. We have described and claimed an ammoxidation processes for the preparation of 3-cyanopyridine, 4-cyanopyridine , benzonitrile and acetonitrile, selectively from 3-picoline, 4-picoline, toluene and ethanol with ammonia and air, respectively using the catalysts prepared by the present invention. The reaction of the feed is carried out over VSAPO catalysts prepared by the process of the present invention in to the temperature range of 300-450 C and at a weight hourly space velocity of 0.25 to 1 0"1 hr . The yields of the nitrites are in the range of 60 to 100%.<br>
The various silico-alumino-phosphates are reported in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106, 6093 (1984) by using various templates. These molecular sieve catalysts are useful in acid catalysed reactions like n-butane cracking. With the variation of templates, the crystal structure, cage/pore dimension vary resulting into large number of molecular sieves. The silico-alumino-phosphates were synthesized using tri-n-propylamine, di-n- propylamine, tetramethylammonium salt. But these SAPOs are not modified to carry out oxidation and ammoxidation type of reactions.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process     for   the    preparation     of     VSAPO as-synthesized       molecular<br>
sieves useful in the oxidation and ammoxidation of aliphatic alcohols, aromatic and hetero cyclic compounds. Molecular sieves are well- known shape selective catalysts. In the present invention, the high-boiling products are avoided due to the shape selectivity of the molecular sieves compared to non-zeolitic ammoxidation catalysts. The non-zeolitic ammoxidation catalysts are not shape -selective catalysts.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of crystalline vanadium-silico-alumino-phosphate catalyst useful for acid catalysed reactions which comprises mixing under constant stirring aqueous solutions of aluminium sulphate, tetralkyl ammonium bromide optionally with sodium chloride with aqueous solution of phosphoric acid and vanadium pentoxide to obtain a mixture, adding sodium silicate to the above said mixture to obtain a slurry, maintaining the pH in the range of 5 to 12, heating the said slurry at a temperature in the range of 150-220°C for a period in the range of 24 to 80 hours, under autogenous pressure and under constant stirring, filtering the reaction mixture by known methods to obtain solid residue washing and drying the above said residue calcining the resultant residue at a temperature in the range of 500 to 550°C for a period of 5 to 15 hours to obtain vanadium-silico alumino -phosphate catalyst.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the tetraalkyl ammonium bromide used may be such as tetrapropyl /butyl ammonium bromide.<br>
The catalysts are prepared in general in the following way. Basically in aluminophosphate molecular sieves the Al: P atomic ratio is 1:1. We have partially substituted phosphorus by silicon and vanadium. Aluminium also may be partially substituted by silicon and vanadium with the corresponding variation in the atomic ratio. Al, P and Si are expected to occupy tetrahedral positions in molecular sieves. The tetrahedral atoms are linked through oxygens to form preferably three-dimensional "rigid framework" of molecular sieve. The charges on the framework atoms are compensated by mobile and exchangeable cations like Na+ or template like TPA+ during the synthesis. Al2 (SO4)3, H3P04, V205, Na2SiO3 with or without NaCl and tetra-propyl ammonium bromide (TPA) or tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBA) used as a template are mixed in distilled water in the pH range of 5.0 to 12.0. The slurry is mixed at least 2 hrs at room temperature with constant stirring and the pH is adjusted by aqueous ammonia. The slurry was put into an auto clave preferably of 600 ml or 1 litre capacity, for autoclaving under autogeneous pressure in the temperature range of 150 to 220° C for 24 hrs to 80 hrs till complete crystallisation was achieved. The mixture was filtered and washed with distilled water. The solid catalyst was dried in oven at 120° C overnight. The organic template was removed by the activation of the catalyst at 500 - 550° C for 5-15 hrs. Then the calcined material was modified by promoters like Sb203 or oxides of the elements active as promoters in the respective reactions. The  XRD  patterns   show  20   -80  %   loss  of  crystallinity.<br>
The reactions were carried out in a tubular, down-flow, pyrex reactor with 20 mm internal diameter. The reaction mixture was fed from top using syringe pump (Sage Instruments, U.S. A) . The product was cooled by using ice-cooled water and collected at the bottom. The required number of ice-cooled traps were used to collect the total amount of products. The products were analysed by using SE-30 (5%) or OV-17 columns. The analysis was confirmed by mass spectra and GC- mass.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the process of the present invention, however, these should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
The VSAPO (TPA-A) was synthesized as follows. The solution A was prepared in 200 ml of distilled water by mixing 63.0 gms of AI2(S04) 3 16 H2O, 26.6 gms of tetrapropyl ammonium bromide, and 11.7 gms of sodium chloride. The solution B was prepared in 100 ml distilled water by adding 15.7 gms of H=PO4 and 18.2 gms of vanadium pentoxide. The solution C was prepared in 100 ml distilled water by mixing 11.4 gms of sodium silicate. Both the solutions are stirred well separately. The solution B is mixed to the solution of A drop wise with constant stirring. The mixture was stirred for 2 hrs, Then the solution C was mixed with the mixture (A + B) drop wise with constant stirring. After mixing the solutions, the pH was adjusted to 9.0 by adding aqueous ammonia.      The      slurry      was      stirred     well     for      about       2 hrs at room temperature. The slurry was made 600 ml by adding the distilled water at 9 pH, The slurry was kept in 1- litre autoclave. The autoclaving was carried out at 200°C for 60 hrs.under autogeneous pressure of about 20 atms. The mixture was then filtered, washed with distilled water and dried in the oven at 120°C overnight. The novel and characteristic X— ray diffraction of the as-synthesized powdered sample was taken and given in Table 1. There was 70-80% loss of crystallinity after calcination &gt; 400°C.<br>
