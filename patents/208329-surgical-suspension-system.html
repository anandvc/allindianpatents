GRANTED<br><br>
The    following    specification    particularly    describes    the invention and  the  manner  in which  it   is     to  be     performed   :   -<br>
14-10-2005<br><br>

Background of the Invention<br>
The. present invention relates to the suspension system arts. It particularly relates to suspension systems for surgical operating room lightheads, monitors, cameras, and the like, and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, the invention will also find application in other ceiling-mounted apparatus and in fields outside the medical industry.<br>
In operating theaters, intensive care rooms, and other hospital and clinical settings, medical equipment, such as overhead lighting and monitoring devices, is carried from overhead by suspension systems extending downward from a ceiling. This arrangement advantageously places the equipment out of the way of busy medical personnel and yet readily accessible when needed. Suspended lighting, for example, can effectively illuminate the surgical site without physically interfering with the surgeon.<br>
Such suspension systems usually include a mounting plate (sometimes called a "cheese plate") attached to a rigid overhead structure, a drop tube connected to the mounting plate, a rotatable spindle fixed to the drop tube which allows rotation about a vertical axis, and one or a plurality of extension and/or articulating arms which connect with and support equipment such as surgical lightheads, monitors, cameras, or other devices. The articulating arms are often multiply jointed to permit several degrees of mechanical freedom for the attached device.<br>
The connection of the drop tube to the mounting plate most often uses a tube-in-tube design wherein the drop tube is fixed to a cylinder which is in turn fixed to the mounting plate using screws or other suitable fasteners. Because ceiling heights in hospitals and clinics vary from one facility to another, and because the suspension system preferably accommodates placement of medical devices in ergonomically acceptable positions for medical personnel relative to the floor, the suspension systems are advantageously adaptable for different ceiling heights.<br>
However, existing suspension systems typically use a drop tube having a fixed length. Height adjustment of the overall system is accomplished either by selecting a drop tube of an appropriate standard or custom length, or by cutting the tube at the installation site and drilling the necessary holes into the tube at the proper locations to effect secure attachment.<br><br><br>
Providing pre-selected custom length drop tubes that are pre-cut at the factory to match the ceiling height disadvantageously introduces logistical problems, long lead times, and the possibility that the drop tubes will not fit with the actual relative ceiling to floor spacing.<br>
Cutting a tube at the installation site risks poorly executed cutting and/or drilling of the tube resulting in a damaged suspension system and possible safety issues. Another disadvantage of cutting the tube at the installation site is that it is usually not possible to machine properly the end of the tube which is cut. The rough cut end is accommodated by including relatively large tolerances for the tube-in-tube connection and may require adjustment screws or the like. However, abnormal clearances can nonetheless result and cannot always be corrected by the adjustment screws.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of existing suspension systems is that the height of the finished system is not subsequently adjustable in the vertical direction. Thus, when the suspension system is moved to a different operating theater having a different ceiling height the drop tube is either replaced or, if the new operating theater has a lower ceiling, re-cut to accommodate the lower ceiling.<br>
The present invention contemplates an improved surgical suspension apparatus which overcomes the aforementioned limitations and others.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a suspension system for suspending one or more of lightheads, monitors, task lights, cameras, and other medical apparatus from an overhead structure at a selectable height is provided. The suspension system includes a drop tube configured for supporting the one or more of lightheads, monitors, cameras, and other medical apparatus. A receiving element receives the drop tube such that a distal end of the drop tube extends below a lower end of the receiving element. A collar is received by the receiving element and surrounds a portion of the drop tube to effectuate a compressive clamping of the portion of the drop tube inside the receiving element, a distance of the drop tube which extends below the lower end of the receiving element being variable. A means is provided for mounting the receiving element to the overhead structure.<br><br><br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method of variably adjusting a distance, elative to a fixed surface, of a distal end of a drop rube for supporting a medical device is provided. The method includes rigidly supporting a receiving element from the fixed surface. The method further includes loosely inserting a collar into a bore of the receiving element, inserting the drop tube into the collar such that an end of the drop tube extends a selected distance below the receiving element, the distance of the drop tube which extends below a lower end of the receiving element being variable, and drawing the collar into the receiving element bore such that the drop tube is compressively clamped by the receiving element and collar.<br>
One advantage of the present invention resides in the enablement of continuous height adjustment over a range of positions in installing a surgical suspension system.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to adapt the suspension system height to different surgical theaters or other ceiling height changes.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention resides in the elimination of circumferential tube-in-tube fitting clearances which are replaced in the preferred embodiment of the invention by a compressed wedge element that surroundingly clamps onto the drop tube.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is the elimination of on-site installation work including precision tube cutting and drilling. The drop tube can be "rough cuf'at the installation site to provide a desired nominal tube length, but precision machining is not necessary.<br>
Still yet another advantage of the present invention is the elimination of a precise length specification in pre-selected custom length drop tubes.<br>
Numerous additional advantages and benefits of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
With reference to FIGURE 1, an overhead lighting system 10 is mounted from a fixed overhead structure 12 which in the illustrated case is an overhead beam 12. A mounting plate or"cheeseplate"14 is secured at a selected distance d below the overhead structure 12 by a plurality of long-shank fasteners 16. Typically, the distance d corresponds to a distance of an operating roomceiling 18 below the structural component 12.<br>
A drop tube 20 connects at a proximal end to the mounting plate 14 and has a distal end 22 extending downward. One or more articulating arms 24 are disposed at the distal end 22. Each articulating arm 24 has a medical device, such as a lighthead 26, CRT monitor 28, flat panel monitor 30, manual task light 34, or the like attached at a distal end 35. Typically, the proximal end of each articulating arm 24 connects to the drop tube 20 via a rotatable spindle 32 which is rotatable about a vertical axis V. Each articulating arm 24 usually includes one or multiple joints 36 which are adjustable about one or more axes each to provide additional degrees of motion freedom.<br>
The overhead lighting system 10 optionally includes additional features, such as a cosmetic ceiling cover 38. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that the system 10 can be employed for mounting other devices besides lightheads and monitors, such as cameras, fiber optical light pipes, and the like. It will further be appreciated that the overhead lighting system<br>
10 is not limited in application to surgical theaters, or even to medical or clinical settings. The<br><br><br>
overhead mounting of devices is beneficial in any setting where it is advantageous to have devices conveniently accessible and yet not in the way"of people's usual movements.<br>
An important parameter of the overhead lighting system 10 is the height of the distal end 22 of the drop tube 20 relative to the floor. For example, many surgical lightheads include reflectors designed to reflect light around the surgeon's head. The lighthead is thus positioned behind the surgeon's head, and the light reflects around the surgeon's head and onto or into the surgical opening. The precise positioning of the lighthead relative to the surgeon's head is thus critical, and improper positioning can result in partial blockage of the illumination by the surgeon's head, or a collision.<br>
Similarly, the monitors 28,30 should be placed at an ergonomically advantageous position so that the surgeon can easily view the monitors during the operation, with the ability to glance back-and-forth between the surgical opening and the monitors.<br>
With reference to FIGURES 2 and 3, an adjustably positionable drop tube locking mechanism 40 is described.<br>
The locking mechanism 40 selectively clamps an intermediate portion 41 of the drop tube between the distal and proximal ends. The locking mechanism includes a drop tube receiving element in the form of a cylinder 42 with an axially extending bore 43, with an interior wall surface 43a, which defines an upper opening 44. The bore 43 preferably has an inner diameter D which decreases, towards a lower end. The cylinder is thus internally shaped as a frustum of a cone and is rigidly attached inside a centrally located opening 45 of the mounting plate 14, for example by welding. The mounting plate 14 together with the welded cylinder 42 provide a securing element 14,42 for rigidly securing the drop tube 20 (shown in part in FIGURES 2 and 3). As best seen in the assembled view of FIGURE 3, the drop tube 20 passes through the opening 44 and narrowing bore 43. The drop tube 20 has a distal end 22 (FIGURE 1) extending downward below the cylinder 42, and a proximal end 46 extending upward adjacent the cylinder 42. The drop tube 20 has a smaller outer diameter than the narrowest portion of the narrowing bore 43 and is therefore adjustably positionable within the cylinder 42 with its distal end 22 extending a selected distance below a lower narrow open end 47 of the bore.<br><br><br>
Although a separate drop tube receiving element, namely the cylinder 42, is shown in the llustrated embodiment, it is also contemplated to form the mounting plate 14 and the cylinder 42 as a single integral piece.<br>
That is, in a contemplated alternative embodiment the mounting plate includes an opening corresponding to the opening 44. However, as can be discerned from FIGURES 2 and 3, such an alternative embodiment may include a thicker mounting plate.<br>
With continuing reference to FIGURES 2 and 3, a locking tube or collar 48 surroundingly encompasses the drop tube 20. The collar 48 is preferably wedge-shaped and has an outside surface 48a with a diameter D which decreases toward a lower end thereof. The collar is thus essentially shaped as a frustum of a cone and is similarly sized to the similarly shaped narrowing bore 43 of the cylinder 42. The taper of the outer surface may be the same as the taper of the bore, although it is also contemplated that the taper may be somewhat greater or lesser than that of the bore. The collar 48 includes at least one and preferably a plurality of longitudinally extending slots 50 spaced .apart along the outer surface of the collar 48. As shown in FIGURE 2, some of the slots 50 extend downward from a wider or upper end 51 of the collar, while other slots extend upward from a narrow or lower end 52 of the collar, although it is also contemplated that the slots need not extend fully to either end 51,52. The resiliency flexible strips 49 thus defined between the slots are able to flex inwardly when the 48 collar is exteriorly compressed. Where the strips 49 extend fully to one or other end 51,52, this allows the free ends of the strips to move into a somewhat overlapping relation when compressed.<br>
The wedge-shaped collar 48 acts as a collet which passes through the cylinder opening 44 and is wedged into the bore 43, with the lower end 52, extending slightly beyond the lower open end 47 of the bore 43. The wedging compresses the collar 48, with the slots 50 facilitating the compression. During compression, the inner diameter of the collar decreases. As the collar 48 compresses, it presses against the drop tube 20 to effectuate a compressive clamping of the drop tube 20 inside the cylinder 42. The collar 48 is preferably formed from metal of a sufficient thickness for the strips 49 to flex inward when compressed and return to their original positions when released.<br><br>
To enable a secure compressive locking, a tightening nut 53 preferably is used. The nut 53 is internally threaded at 54 and threadedly attaches to external threads 55 disposed on the narrow end 52 of the collar 48. As can be seen from FIGURE 2, the narrow end 52 is not tapered, in the region of the threads. As the nut 53 is tightened, the collar 48 is compressively drawn into the opening 44 of the cylinder 42 to effectuate the compressive clamping. In place of threads, other means of tightening the nut onto the collar are also contemplated.<br>
Optionally, a lock washer 56 is included to prevent the nut 53 from loosening. Furthermore, although a slotted wedge- shaped collar 48 is illustrated, other wedge-shaped elements are suitably substituted therefore as desired.<br>
For example, a collet or other type of locking tube is also contemplated. In another embodiment, only one of the collar 42 and cylinder 42 has a taper, for example, the cylinder bore 43 may have a constant diameter D while the collar is tapered, or the collar have a constant diameter d while the cylinder 42 is tapered.<br>
FIGURE 3 particularly illustrates the subject wedge lock mechanism 40 and selected suspension system components in their assembled configuration. As can be appreciated, by tightening the hut 53, the wedge 48 is drawn further into the narrowing bore 43 of the securing element 14,42 and is clamped into place. The slots 50 within the wedge 48 allow the wedge 48 to compress and tighten around the outer surface of the drop tube 20. The drop tube 20 is essentially thereby fixed within the wedge- shaped collar 48 and the cylinder 42 through frictional forces created between the component parts. The wedge lock mechanism 40 advantageously provides for continuous and repeatable height adjustment, by simply loosening the nut 53, sliding the drop tube 20 to its new position relative to the cylinder 42 and, more importantly, to the floor, and retightening the nut 53.<br>
The length of drop tube 20 which extends below the cylinder 42 is thus infinitely variable between an upper position, in which the uppermost spindle 32 is flush with the nut 53, and a lower position, in which the upper end of the tube 20 is clamped by the collar. The excess, upper portion of the drop tube 20 is thus"stored"until needed within the cylinder 42 and may extend upward, into the space above the ceiling 18, thus providing for the portion of the drop tube below the cylinder 42 to be increased or decreased in length, as the need arises.<br><br>
With continuing reference to FIGURES 1 through 3 and with further reference to FIGURE 4 which shows a perspective exploded view of the suspension system 10, the suspension system 10 is connected using the fasteners 16 (FIGURE 1) which insert into a selected plurality of the openings 58 in the cheeseplate 14. The cosmetic ceiling cover 38 (FIGURES 1 and 4) is secured by locking half-rings 60 (FIGURE 4). Since the cosmetic ceiling cover 38 is not a weight-bearing component, the securing does not need to be particularly strong, and various securing components are contemplated in place of the rings 60.<br><br>
Preferably, a safety ring assembly 70 is provided to prevent the tube 20 from pulling through the collar 48 in the unlikely event that the system loosens. The safety ring assembly attaches to the tube 20 above the collar 48 using suitable fasteners 72, such as bolts, screws or the like (FIGURE 5). In that way, if the tube 20 slides relative to the collar 48, contact is made between the split rings of the safety ring and the upper end of the tapered collar urging the collar into further compression against the tube and also mechanically preventing the rube from pulling through the collar.<br><br><br>
