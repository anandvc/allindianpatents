				<td>Master Cylinder<br>
The present invention relates to combined master cylinder and dump valves, and also to a method of manufacturing such valves. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a combined master cylinder and booster.<br>
Certain vehicles, such as bulldozers, use a hydrostatic drive system. Typically an engine driven hydraulic pump will provide a flow of pressurised hydraulic fluid to a hydraulic motor. The hydraulic motor is coupled to wheels (or tracks) of the vehicle. Thus, by driving the hydraulic motor, it is possible to manoeuvre the vehicle. The vehicle will be provided with brakes, and in order not to overheat the brakes, pressurised flow to the hydraulic motor must substantially cease prior to the brakes being applied.<br>
It is known to provide a "dump valve" between the engine driven pump and the hydraulic motor. Opening of the dump valve causes the pump/motor to vent to tank, thereby ceasing drive to the vehicle wheels. Once the valve is open, the brakes are then applied. In this way the brakes are only required to slow the vehicle and do not act against any driving force of the hydraulic pump/motor. The applicant has invented a new combined master cylinder and dump valve.<br>
Furthermore, certain other vehicles, such as agricultural tractors, are known to use a combined brake master cylinder and booster. In particular, those vehicles that use hydrostatic drive systems do not use a combined brake master cylinder and booster. Similarly, those vehicles that use a combined brake master cylinder and booster do not have hydrostatic drive systems.<br>
in combined brake master cylinder and boosters, brake pedal effort applied via a push rod is increased (or boosted) and this boosted force is applied to a master cylinder. Thus, such a device assists the operator of the vehicle when braking. Typically such a system is utilised with a mechanically driven vehicle. Thus, in order to apply the brake, the operator will typically have taken his right foot off the accelerator and applied it to the brake pedal, or alternatively will simultaneously depress the clutch pedal with his left foot and the brake pedal with his right foot. In either event it is apparent that the drive to the vehicle wheels<br>
ceases via a mechanism other than the combined master cylinder and booster valve.   In other words, the combined master cylinder and booster valve plays no part in the ceasing of drive to the vehicle wheels.<br>
The applicant is the first to appreciate that a significant number of components of known combined master cylinder and booster valves can be utilised to provide a combined master cylinder and dump valve. Thus, due to the economies of scale, this provides for the potential to reduce both the cost of the known combined master cylinder and booster valve, and also a reduction in the cost of a new combined master cylinder and dump valve.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a combined master cylinder and<br>
dump valve including a body having a body bore, a brake port, a tank port, and a pressure<br>
port with each port being hydraulically connected with the body bore, a piston slideable<br>
within the body bore and a plunger,<br>
the piston delimiting a part of the body bore to define a master cylinder for pressurising the<br>
brake port, the piston further including a piston seal for isolating the pressure port from the<br>
tank port, and including a piston bore, a first piston hole set for hydraulically connecting<br>
the pressure port to the piston bore and a second piston hole set for hydraulically<br>
connecting the piston bore to the tank port, the plunger being slideably received in the<br>
piston bore and having a plunger bore, a plunger hole set for selectively connecting the first<br>
piston hole set with the plunger bore, a plunger seal arrangement for selectively isolating<br>
the first piston hole set from the plunger bore,<br>
the plunger bore being hydraulically connected to the piston bore, such that:-<br>
in a rest condition the master cylinder is unpressurised and the seal arrangement isolates<br>
the first piston hole set from the plunger bore, thereby isolating the pressure port from the<br>
tank port, and<br>
in an actuated condition, the plunger acts to slideably move the piston to pressurise the<br>
brake port, and the plunger hole set hydraulically connects the first piston hole set with the<br>
plunger bore, thereby hydraulically connecting the pressure port to the tank port.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing one of a combined master cylinder and dump valve and a combined master cylinder and booster including the steps of:-<br>
providing a body suitable for manufacturing either a combined master cylinder and<br>
dump valve or a combined master cylinder and booster,<br>
providing a first set of components for assembling with the body in order to provide a<br>
combined master cylinder and dump valve,<br>
providing a second set of components for assembling with the body in order to provide<br>
a combined master cylinder and booster,<br>
assembling one of the first or second sets of components with the body to provide one<br>
of a combined master cylinder and dump valve or a combined master cylinder and<br>
booster.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided A method of manufacturing a combined master cylinder and dump valve and a combined master cylinder and booster including the steps of:-<br>
providing two identical bare body castings,<br>
machining a first bare casting in a first manner to provide a combined master cylinder<br>
and dump valve body,<br>
machining a second bare casting in a second different manner to provide a combined<br>
master cylinder and booster body, assembling a first set of components with the<br>
combined master cylinder and dump valve body in order to provide a combined master<br>
cylinder and dump valve,<br>
assembling a second set of components with the combined master cylinder and booster<br>
body in order to provide a combined master cylinder and booster.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:-<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of a hydraulic circuit incorporating the combined master<br>
cylinder and dump valve according to the present invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic cross-section view of a combined master cylinder and dump valve<br>
according to the present invention in a rest position,<br>
figure 3 is a manufacturing cross-section drawing of a known combined master cylinder and booster in a rest position, and<br>
Figure 4 is an alternative schematic view to figure 1 showing the internal operation of the combined master cylinder and dump valve in more detail.<br>
With reference to figures 1 and 4 there is shown a vehicle 1 having an engine 2 drivingly coupled to a hydraulic pump 3. A hydraulic line 4 couples the output from hydraulic pump 3 to the input of a hydraulic motor 5. The hydraulic motor 5 is drivingly coupled to wheels 6 of the vehicle. The output from the hydraulic motor 5 returns to the hydraulic tank 7 via hydraulic line 8, tee'd of hydraulic line 4 is hydraulic line 9 which is connected to the pressure port 10 of a combined master cylinder and dump valve 11 (herein known as a CMDV) according to the present invention. Hydraulic line 12 connects the tank port 13 of the CMDV to tank. Hydraulic line 15 connects the brake port 14 of the CMDV to brake 16. Operation of the vehicle is as follows:-<br>
In order to drive the vehicle, engine 2 drives hydraulic pump 3 which takes hydraulic fluid from tank 7 and pressurises it. Pressurised fluid is then fed along hydraulic line 4 to hydraulic motor 5 which is caused to rotate, in turn, rotating wheel 6 and hence moving the vehicle. When the vehicle operator requires to brake the vehicle, he or she will apply their foot to the foot brake pedal whereupon the dump valve components of the CMDV will vent line 4 to tank via lines 9 and 12. The master cylinder components of the CMDV will then act to hydraulically pressurise line 15, thereby applying the brakes.<br>
The CMDV can be seen in more detail in figure 2. The CMDV includes a body 20, typically formed as a casting and then subsequently machined. Body 20 includes a central body bore 22 having a first cylindrical portion 24 of diameter d and a second cylindrical portion 26 of diameter D. Pressure port 10 and tank port 13 are both hydraulically connected to the second cylindrical portion 26, and brake port 14 is hydraulically connected to the first cylindrical portion 24.<br>
First cylindrical portion 24 defines a master cylinder 24A and the second cylindrical portion 26 defines a body main cylinder 26A.<br>
A master cylinder recuperation hole 28 is capable of selectively hydraulically connecting master cylinder 24A with the body main cylinder 26A.<br>
Slideably mounted within the body is a piston 30. A first end 32 of piston 30 is received within the first cylindrical portion 24 with the remainder of the piston being generally received within second cylindrical portion 26. First end 32 includes a master cylinder seal 34.<br>
A first piston land 36 receives a first piston seal 37 for sealing the first piston land to the second cylindrical portion 26. A second piston land 38 receives a second piston seal 39 for sealing the second piston land to the second cylindrical portion 26. It can be seen that the first and second piston lands are spaced apart axially and define an annular region 40 of the body main cylinder 26A. The piston includes a piston bore 42 and a first piston hole set 44 includes a series of circumferentially spaced radially orientated holes (only two of which are shown) which hydraulically connect annular region 40 with piston bore 42.<br>
The piston and in particular the first piston land 36, together with the body main cylinder 26A define an annular region 46, to the left of first piston land 36 when viewing figure 2.<br>
A second piston hole set 48 includes a series of radially orientated holes (only two shown) which hydraulically connect the piston bore 42 with the annular region 46.<br>
A check valve 50 is capable of selectively allowing hydraulic fluid to flow from piston bore 42 into the master cylinder 24A.<br>
Piston bore 42 includes cylindrical portion 43 of diameter E. Slideably mounted within cylindrical portion 43 (of diameter E) is a first end 52A of a plunger 52. Mounted on first end 52A is a plunger seal arrangement 54 which includes a first plunger seal 55 and a second plunger seal 56 both in sealing relationship with the walls of cylindrical portion 43.<br>
It is apparent that the first plunger seal 55 is axially spaced from the second plunger seal 56.<br>
First end 52A further includes a plunger hole set 58 which hydraulically connects a region of the piston bore to the right (when viewing figure 2) of second plunger seal 56 with a plunger bore 60 of the plunger.<br>
A circlip 62 is mounted in a groove of the piston and retains the plunger generally within the piston bore. A second end 52B of the plunger 52 includes a groove 64 to receive a third plunger seal 65.<br>
A second end 52B further includes a recess 66 which receives a push rod 67.<br>
A closing spiggot 68 is generally top hat in cross section and includes a land having a seal 69 to seal between the land and the second cylindrical portion 62. The closing spiggot includes a central bore 70 of diameter F for slideably receiving the second end 52B of the plunger 52, and in particular for sealingly engaging the third plunger seal 65. In use spiggot 68 does not move relative to the body 20. Seal 69 prevents the leakage of hydraulic fluid outside of the CMDV.<br>
A closing plate 72 is secured to the body 20 via bolt (not shown) or studs and nuts (not shown) which engage threaded holes 74.<br>
A first resilient means in the form of a first spring 76 acts between a first spring abutment 77 of the piston and a spring abutment 78 of the plunger to bias these abutments apart. A second resilient means in the form of a second spring 80 act between a spring abutment 81 of the body and a second spring abutment 82 (in this case the first piston land 36) of the piston 30 to bias the abutments 81 and 82 apart.<br>
Plunger 52 includes a plunger abutment 84 and piston 30 includes a corresponding piston abutment 86. In the rest condition as shown in figure 2, abutments 84 and 86 are spaced apart by distance x. Operation of the CMDV is as follows.<br>
In summary, operator pedal force is applied to push rod 67 which initially moves plunger 52 to the left, relative to piston 30 thereby progressively closing the gap between abutments 84 and 86, and hydraulically connecting pressure port 10 with tank port 13, thereby operating as a dump valve. When abutment 84 contacts abutment 86, piston 30 is caused to move to the left such that master cylinder seal 34 moves past recuperation hole 28, thereby sealing the master cylinder 24A and allowing brake port 14 to be pressurised, to apply the brakes.<br>
Figure 4 shows a detailed schematic view of the combined master cylinder and dump valve 11 with body 20 being represented by the chain dotted line. The three ports (pressure port 10, tank port 13 and brake port 14) can be seen connecting the associated external hydraulic lines with the body 20. As will be further described below, it is important that no air enters the master cylinder 24A and thus the check valve 50 and master cylinder recuperation hole 28 must recuperate the master cylinder from a region of the body 20 that is full of hydraulic fluid. In this case recuperation hole 28 and check valve 50 both recuperate the master cylinder from the annular region 46 which effectively acts as an internal tank. This internal "tank" 46 has been represented on figure 4.<br>
The operation in more detail is as follows:-<br>
Pressure port 10 is permanently hydraulically connected to annular region 40, since first piston seal 37 always sits to the left of pressure port 10 when viewing figure 2, and third piston seal 39 always sits to the right of pressure port 10 even at the extreme of movement of the piston towards the left when viewing figure 2.<br>
Annular region 40 is in permanent hydraulic connection with the first piston hole set 44.<br>
Tank port 13, annular region 46, second piston hole set 48, piston bore 42, plunger bore 60 and plunger hole set 58 are all permanently hydraulically connected to each other.<br>
The hydraulic connection between master cylinder 24A and annular region 46 is selectively blocked as master cylinder seal 34 passes to the left of recuperation hole 28.<br>
As shown in figure 2, the plunger seal arrangement 54 ensures that the first piston hole set 44 is hydraulically isolated from the plunger hole set 58. However, as second plunger seal 56 moves to the left of the first piston hole set, the first piston hole set becomes hydraulically connected with the plunger hole set 58.<br>
Check valve 50 selectively allows for recuperation of the master cylinder 24 in a known manner.<br>
Figure 2 shows the CMDV in a rest position, with no force being applied to the push rod 67. Under the circumstances spring 80 acts to bias piston 30 into abutting engagement with closing spiggot 68, which acts as a stop. Similarly first spring 76 biases plunger 52 to the right when viewing the figure, into abutting engagement with circlip 62. It can be seen that in this position, recuperating holes 28 are open, and first piston hole set 44 has been closed by plunger seal arrangement 54. As such, pressure port 10 cannot vent to tank port 13 and hence hydraulic line 9 is closed. Thus, hydraulic pump 3 is capable of driving hydraulic motor 5.<br>
As mentioned above, it is preferable that pressure port 10 is hydraulically connected to tank port 13 (i.e. the dump valve is opened) prior to the master cylinder 24A pressurising the brake port 14 (i.e. prior to the brakes being applied). In order to achieve this function, the first and second springs 76 and 80 and the distance x between abutments 84 and 86 must be correctly designed. By way of example, one installation may have an installed pre-load on second spring 80 of 200 newtons. First spring 76 may have an installed preload of 60 newtons and distance x may be 7mm. The spring rate of first spring 76 would be 140 newtons per 7mm.<br>
From these figures, it will be appreciated that the installed pre-load of the first spring 76,<br>
when the CMDV is in the rest position, is less than the installed pre-load of the second<br>
spring 80. Thus, when a force is applied to the push rod, the first spring 76 will compress<br>
in preference to second spring 80.  This in turn means that as push rod 67 moves to the<br>
left, the piston initially remains stationary and the plunger seal arrangement 54 moves to the left relative to the stationary first piston hole set. Further movement of the push rod 67 to the left causes the distance between abutments 84 and 86 to further close and second plunger seal 56 ultimately will move to the left of the first piston hole set, thereby hydraulically connecting the pressure port to the tank port and hence opening the dump valve.<br>
As abutments 84 and 86 contact each other, first spring 76 will have been compressed by 7mm and will therefore be exherting a load of 200 newtons (i.e. an initial installed load of 60 newtons plus 7mm of compression at a rate of 140 newtons per 7mm compression). It will be appreciated therefore that as abutments 84 and 86 contact each other, the spring load exerted by first spring 76 is substantially equal to the spring load exherted by second spring 80. Further movement of the push rod to the left causes abutment 84 to press on abutment 86, thereby moving the piston to the left, closing the recuperation valve 28, and hence pressurising the master cylinder and brake port 14.<br>
The release of the brake pedal causes the components to return the position shown in figure 2, thereby releasing the brake, and closing the dump valve, thus allowing the hydraulic pump 3 to drive the hydraulic motor 5 to move the vehicle.<br>
As shown in figure 2 the first piston hole set comprises a plurality of holes spaced circumferentially around the piston. All holes are formed at the same longitudinal position of the piston.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, the first piston hole set can comprise a series of circumferentially spaced holes, with each hole being at a different longitudinal position of the piston. Clearly, if the plunger seal arrangement of such an embodiment is in the form of a first plunger seal and a second plunger seal, then these plunger seals must be spaced apart sufficiently to encompass all holes of the first piston hole set to ensure that the first piston hole set is hydraulically isolated from the first plunger hole set and a central region of the piston bore. In a preferred embodiment, the holes of the first piston hole set are formed as part of a helix around the piston circumference.<br>
By way of example, in one application, the first piston hole set may include 16 radially orientated holes each of 1.5mm diameter. When formed as a helix, adjacent holes can be longitudinally offset by 0.2mm. Thus the actual distance between the first hole and the sixteenth hole would be 3mm (i.e. 15 gaps X 0.2mm = 3mm). Furthermore, the total distance travelled by the plunger, relative to the piston, between when the first piston hole is starting to open and when the last piston hole is fully open is 4.5mm (i.e. 15 gaps X 0.2mm + 1 hole diameter (1.5mm) = 4.5mm). Thus, by arranging the holes in this manner it is possible to provide a dump valve which progressively opens. This is particularly beneficial, since it allows the operator to "inch forward" the vehicle in a controlled manner, thereby allowing for good control of the vehicle at very slow speeds.<br>
As mentioned above, preferably, the holes are provided on a helix, though of course it is not necessary to provide the holes in this form in order to provide a first piston hole set wherein different holes are positioned at different longitudinal positions on the piston.<br>
Typically the 16 hole arrangements mentioned above, might be used in conjunction with a distance x between abutment 84 and 86 of 7mm. This allows for manufacturing tolerance errors, and an initial movement of the plunger (of say 2mm) between the rest position, and the first of the 16 holes starting to open.<br>
As mentioned above, the spring force of the first spring 76, when compressed by distance x (200 newtons) is substantially equal to the spring force of spring 80 when in a rest condition (also 200 newtons). This provides for a good pedal feel and a substantially seamless transition from the dump valve being fully open to the start of the brakes being applied.<br>
It will be appreciated that certain components of the CMDV act as a master cylinder, and certain other components of the CMDV act as a dump valve (shown generally by arrow 90). It will also be appreciated that the dump valve 90 and master cylinder act sequentially, i.e. the dump valve 90 opens following which the master cylinder acts to apply the brakes.<br>
The applicant has therefore invented a new and patentable combined master cylinder and dump valve.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the term "hole set" covers a set having any number of holes, including just a single hole.<br>
Figure 2 shows various seals which are elastomeric in nature. Under certain circumstances, where a limited amount of seal leakage can be tolerated, certain seals can be defined by a simple piston land or a plunger land, in the absence of any elastomeric or other separate "sealing" component.<br>
Furthermore, the applicant is the first to realise that it is possible to adapt a known combined master cylinder and booster to provide a CMDV. Thus, with reference to figure 3 there is shown a known combined master cylinder and booster 110 (known here as a CMB). Certain components of the CMB 110 are identical with the CMDV 11. In particular, body 20, master cylinder seal 34, check valve 50, first piston seal 37, second piston seal 39, third plunger seal 65, first plunger seal 55, second plunger seal 56, closing plate 72, closing spiggot 68, closing spiggot seal 69, and push rod 67.<br>
It is pointed out that these components may look different, simply because figure 3 is an engineering manufacturing drawing and figure 2 is a schematic drawing. Figure 3 is a true representation of the components. By way of explanation figure 3 includes protective caps over the ports which are removed prior to fitting the valve.<br>
Operation of CMB 110 is known, but will now be briefly described:-<br>
As an initial point, first piston hole set 144 of piston 130 includes a series of circumferentially spaced, radially orientated holes. However, all holes are located at the same axial position on the piston. Second piston hole set 148 also includes a series of circumferentially spaced radially orientated holes, again all located at the same longitudinal position on the piston. It can be seen that the first piston hole set is positioned just to the<br>
left of the second plunger seal 56, and the second piston hole set 148 is positioned just to the left of the first plunger seal 55.<br>
As the push rod moves to the left by operation of a foot brake, initially the plunger moves to the left such that first and second plunger seals 55 and 56 initially close all of the holes of their corresponding piston hole sets 148 and 144. Continued movement of the push rod to the left then causes the plunger seals 55 and 56 to partially open all of the holes of their corresponding hole set. This allows pressurised fluid from pressure port 10 to enter the plunger bore 160 which causes the piston to move to the left resulting in plunger seals 55 and 56 closing all of their corresponding holes. This pressurised fluid then becomes trapped in plunger bore and acts on diameter F of the plunger to force the plunger to the right when viewing figure 3, and acts on diameter D of the piston to force the piston to the left when viewing figure 3. Since diameter D is larger than diameter F, the force applied to push rod 67 is "boosted" by the ratio of (D X D/F X F) and hence the force applied to the master cylinder piston portion 131 of piston 130 is greater than the force applied to the push rod 67.<br>
Thus, to provide a boost ratio of 2-1, D needs to be 1.412 times larger than F. Boost ratios of 3-1, 4-1 and 5-1 can be provided by ensuring that D is 1.732, 2.000, 2.236 times larger than F respectively.<br>
It will be appreciated, that under the circumstances both springs 176 and 180 have become partially compressed when then booster is operating to boost the push road load. This can be contrasted with a CMDV according to the present invention, wherein during progressive opening of the dump valve, spring 76 is compressed, whereas spring 80 remains in its initially installed condition.<br>
A comparison of piston 30 and piston 130 shows relatively few differences. The main difference is the difference in position of the second piston hole sets 48 and 148. In particular the master cylinder piston portion 131 can be identical the corresponding portion of piston 30.<br>
Furthermore, a comparison of plunger 52 and plunger 152 again shows there to be few differences, the main difference being in the alternative positioning of first plunger seal 55. In particular, second plunger seal 56 is located at the same position, and that part of plunger 152 to the left of second plunger seal 56 is identical to the corresponding part of plunger 52.<br>
It can be seen therefore that the applicant has been able to adapt a device (the CMB) having one type of valve (a booster valve) to a completely different device (CMDV) having a completely different sort of valve (a dump valve) for use in a completely different application. This adaptation has been carried out using a considerable number of common components, thereby by virtue of the economies of scale, potentially providing for both a cheaper CMDV, and also a cheaper CMB.<br>
It is here emphasised that there is no "boosting" aspect to the CMDV. The boost ratio of the CMB is dependent upon the relative diameters F and D. The applicant is the first to realise that it is possible to retain the same diameters D and F of a CMB, and apply them to a CMDV, even though the relative diameters play no part in the operation of the CMDV.<br>
Typically the body 20 will be made from a casting. Where there are minor differences between the finally machined body of a CMDV and the finally machined body of a CMB (e.g. a different thread size on one or more of the ports), then it is possible to use the same bare body casting and machine it in a slightly different manner to provide for the slightly differing CMDV and CMB finally machined bodies. However, under other circumstances, it is possible to use the same bare casting, and machine it in an identical manner (for example body 20) to provide a body for both a CMDV and a CMB.<br>
Similarly, it is possible to provide a common bare piston casting which is machined in a slightly different manner to provide a CMDV piston or a CMB piston.<br>
Similarly, the plunger may be provided as a common bare casting and machined slightly differently to provide a CMDV plunger or a CMB plunger.<br>
The applicant is the first to realise that it is possible to produce identical bare castings, and under certain circumstances machine the bare castings in an identical manner to provide for devices (a CMDV or a CMB) which have significantly different applications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
