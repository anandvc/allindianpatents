				<td>Selective  Cyclic  Peptides<br>
Obesity is widely recognized as a serious health problem for the developed countries, and has reached epidemic status in the United States. More than 50% of the U.S. population is considered overweight, with &gt;25% diagnosed as clinically obese and at considerable risk for heart disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, and certain cancers. This epidemic presents a significant burden on the health care system as projected obesity treatment costs of more than $70 billion annually are expected in the U.S. alone. Strategies for treating obesity include reducing food intake or enhancing the expenditure of energy.<br>
It has been demonstrated that, when injected into the third ventricle of the brain or intraperitoneally, a cyclic heptapeptide analog of a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (aMSH) having melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) agonist activity caused long lasting inhibition of food intake in mice. This effect was reversible when co-administered with a MC4-R antagonist. (Fan, et al., Nature (1997) 385:165-168)   Therefore, agonists of MC4-R activity would be useful in treating or preventing obesity.<br>
There are five known melanocortin receptors based on sequence homology that ranges from 35-60% homology between family members ((Cone, et al., Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. (1996) 51:287-318), but these receptors differ in their functions. For example, the MCl-R is a G-protein<br>
coupled receptor that regulates pigmentation in response to the aMSH, which is a potent agonist of MCl-R. (Cone, et al., ibid.). Agonism of the MCl-R receptor results in stimulation of the melanocytes which causes eumelanin and increases the risk for cancer of the skin. Agonism of MCl-R can also have neurological effects. Stimulation of MC2-R activity can result in carcinoma of adrenal tissue. The effects of agonism of the MC3-R and MC5-R are not yet known. All of the melanocortin receptors respond to the peptide hormone class of melanocyte<br><br>
stimulating hormones (MSH). These peptides are derived from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a prohormone of 131 amino acids that is processed into three classes of hormones; the<br>
melanocortins (oc, J3 and y), adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and various endorphins (e.g. lipotropin) (Cone, et aL, ibid.). Because of their different functions, simultaneous agonism of the activities of multiple melanocortin receptors has the potential of causing unwanted side effects. Therefore it is desirable that an agonist of MC4-R be more selective for the MC4-R than for one or more of the other melanocortin receptors.<br>

All of the tested compounds had an EC50 for MC4-R agonist activity of less than 500 nM, and all exhibited at least 10-fold greater MC4-R agonist activity than MCl-R agonist activity. In contrast, the compound Ac-Nle-Cyclo(Asp-Lys)-Asp-His-(D)Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys-NH2 exhibited about equal MCl-R and MC4-R agonist activities.<br>

All solvents, isopropanol (iPrOH), methylene chloride (CH2C2), dimethylformamide<br>
(DMF) and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) were purchased from Fisher or Burdick &amp; Jackson and were used without additional distillation. Trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Halocarbon or Fluka and used without further purification. Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was purchased from Fluka or Aldrich and used without further purification. Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) dimethylsulfide (DMS) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and used without further purification. Protected amino acids were generally of the L configuration and were obtained commercially from Bachem, Advanced ChemTech, or Neosystem. Purity of these reagents was confirmed by thin layer chromatography, NMR and melting point prior to use. Benzhydrylamine resin (BHA) was a copolymer of styrene - 1% divinylbenzene (100-200 or 200-400 mesh) obtained from Bachem or Advanced Chemtech. Total nitrogen content of these resins were generally between 03 - 1.2 meq/g.<br>
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted on a LDC apparatus consisting of Constametric I and III pumps, a Gradient Master solvent programmer and mixer, and a Spectromonitor HI variable wavelength UV detector. Analytical HPLC was performed in reversed phase mode using Vydac Cjg columns (0.4 x 30 cm). Preparative HPLC separations<br>
were run on Vydac columns (2 x 25 cm).<br>
The linear peptides were preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis by the method generally described by Merrifield, [/. Amer. Chenu Soc., 1963,85,2149], although other equivalent chemical synthesis known in the art could be used as previously mentioned. Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha-amino acid to a suitable resin. Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha-amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang)<br>
resin, or by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-a-[l-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin. Preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when the desired peptide being synthesized has an unsubstituted amide at the C-terminus.<br>
Since the compounds of the present invention are cyclic peptides, prepared by the formation of a lactam or a disulfide bond, the precursor linear peptides are assembled so as to<br><br>
place suitable amino acids or mimetics carrying the appropriate side chain residues in positions in the linear peptidesthat can ultimately be induced to undergo an intramolecular amide bond or disulfide bond formation. The lactams are formed through the coupling a side chain amino functionality of a C-terminal amino acid residue with a distal carboxylic acid residue, while the disulfide bond is formed through the oxidative coupling of two cysteine residues appropriately incorporated at the C-terminal and at or near the N-terminus of the precursor linear peptide. For example, in the preparation of the lactam peptides, in the precursor linear pentapeptides the N-cap can be used as a template to incorporate a carboxyl residue, e.g. structure X, or in the case of hexapeptides, the peptide is designed such that the N-terminal amino acid residue is chosen from one of the amino acids containing a suitably protected side chain carboxylic acid group, eg aspartic acid, glutamic acid. In the linear heptapeptides, ether aspartic acid or glutamic acid are incorporated as the penultimate residue from the N-terminus. In all the precursor linear peptides, i.e., the hepta- hexa- and pentapeptides, the C-terminal residue is chosen from natural or unnatural amino acid bearing a suitably protected basic side chain residue, capable of forming a amide bond when deprotected, for example lysine, ornithine, 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid, 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid. To form a cyclic peptide containing a disulfide bond, where the precursor is a linear hexapeptide, the peptide is designed such that an appropriately S-protected cysteine residue is incorporated as both the C and N-terminal residues, while if the precursor is a linear heptapeptide the appropriately S-protected cysteine residues are incorporated as both the C terminal residue and the penultimate N-terminal residue as in for example X.<br>
In general, to prepare the linear peptides, the amino acids or mimetic are coupled onto the Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin using the Fmoc protected form of amino acid or mimetic, with 2-5 equivalents of amino acid and a suitable coupling reagent After couplings, the resin may be washed and dried under vacuum. Loading of the amino acid onto the resin may be determined by amino acid analysis of an aliquot of Fmoc-amino acid resin or by determination of Fmoc groups by UV analysis. Any unreacted amino groups may be capped by reacting the resin with acetic anhydride and diisopropylethylamine in methylene chloride.<br>
The resins are carried through several repetitive cycles to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in DMF may  be used for this purpose. Preferably 40% piperidine in DMF is utilized.<br>
i<br>
Following the removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. For example, appropriate reagents for such<br><br>
syntheses arebenzotriazol-1-yloxy-tri- (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), Bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP), 2-(lH-Benzotriazole-l-yl)-l&gt;l,3&gt;3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate (HBTU), and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIG). Preferred here are HBTU and DIC. Other activating agents as described by Barany and Merrifield [The Peptides, Vol. 2, J. Meienhofer, ed., Academic Press, 1979&gt; pp 1-284] maybe utilized. Various reagents such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) and3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-l,2,3-benzotriazine (HOOBT) may be added to the coupling mixtures in order to optimize the synthetic cycles. Preferred here is HOBT.<br><br><br>
determine extent of completion [Kaiser et at Anal Biochem. 1970,34,595-598]. Slow reaction kinetics was observed for Fmoc-Arg (Pmc) and for couplings to secondary amines by sterically hindered acids. Any incomplete coupling reactions were either recoupled with freshly prepared activated amino acid or capped by treating the peptide resin with acetic anhydride as described above. The fully assembled peptide-resins were dried in vacuum for several hours.<br>
For each compound, the blocking groups were removed and the linear peptide cleaved from the resin by the following procedure. Generally. The peptide-resins are treated with 100<br>
μL ethanedithiol, 100 μL dimethylsulfide, 300 μL anisole, and 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, per gram of resin, at room temperature for 120 min. The resin is filtered off and the filtrates are precipitated in chilled ethyl ether. The precipitates are centrifuged and the ether layer is decanted. The residue is washed with two or three volumes of Et2O and recentrifuged. If<br>
desired, the crude linear peptides are purified by preparative HPLC. The peptides were applied to the columns in a minimum volume of either AcOH/H2O or 0.1% TFA/H2O. Gradient<br>
elution is generally started at 10% B buffer, 10% -60% B in 90 minutes, (buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H20, buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH3CN) at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. UV detection is made at 280<br>
nm. Fractions were collected at 1.0 - 2.5 minute intervals and inspected by analytical HPLC Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.<br>
To prepare the lactams, the appropriate unpurified linear peptide is dissolved in a suitable inert solvent, for example N-methyl pyrrolidone or DMF, preferably DMF and adjusted to an apparent pH of 8.0 by the addition of a tertiary amine base, for example N-methyl morpholine, and then is treated with an amide bond forming reagent, preferably BOP. The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature between 40 °C and O °C, preferably at about room temperature. Purification of the crude cyclic peptides is carried out by preparative HPLC Gradient elution is generally started at 20% B buffer, 20% -60% B in 90 minutes, (buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H2O, buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH3CN) at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. UV detection is made at 280<br>
nm. Fractions were collected and monitored by analytical HPLC Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.<br>
To prepare the cyclic disulfide peptides, the purified HPLC-purified linear peptide containing two appropriately positioned cysteine residues, is dissolved at a fairly high dilution level in an suitable inert solvent mixture, for example aqueous DMSO and the solution is adjusted to pH 8.0 by the careful addition of ammonium hydroxide. Oxygen is then bubbled into the stirred solution. The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature between 40 °C and O °C, preferably at about room temperature and the progress of the cyclization is monitored by analytical HPLC After the reaction is judged to be completed, the solution is lyophillized and<br><br>
the crude cyclic peptide is purified by preparative HPLC. Gradient elution is generally started at 20% B buffer, 20% -60% B in 90 minutes, (buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H2O, buffer B: 0.1%<br>
TFA/CH3CN) at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. UV detection is made at 280 nm. Fractions were<br>
collected and monitored by analytical HPLC Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.<br>

run. Fractions were collected at 1.0 - 2.5 minute intervals and inspected by analytical HPLC. Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.<br>
Purity of the final products is checked by analytical HPLC on a reversed phase column as stated above. Purity of all products is judged to be approximately 95 - 99%. All final products were also subjected to fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) or electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). All products yielded the expected parent M-f-H ions within acceptable limits.<br>
The process for synthesizing the representative compounds maybe carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide.<br>
Such conventional procedures for synthesizing the novel compounds of the present invention include for example any solid phase peptide synthesis method. In such a method the synthesis of the novel compounds can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods [Merrifield, R. B., /. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1963,85y 2149-2154; Barany et dL. The peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980)].<br>
Common to chemical syntheses of peptides is the protection of reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid moieties with suitable protecting groups, which will prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is ultimately removed. Usually also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino<br><br>
protecting group and allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. While specific protecting groups have been disclosed in regard to the solid phase synthesis method, it should be noted that each amino acid can be protected by an protective group conventionally used for the respective amino acid in solution phase synthesis.<br>
Alpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group selected from aromatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such asp-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl,p-nitroben2yloxycarbonyl,p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p4&gt;iphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) andp-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz); aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and aUyloxycarbonyi. Herein, Fmoc is the most preferred for alpha amino protection.<br>
Guanidino groups maybe protected by a suitable protecting group selected from nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, and Boc. Pmc is the most preferred for arginine (Arg).<br>
All solvents, isopropanol (iPrOH), methylene chloride (CH2C2), dimethylformamide<br>
(DMF) and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) were purchased from Fisher or Burdick &amp; Jackson and were used without additional distillation. Trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Halocarbon or Fluka and used without further purification. Diisopropyicarbodiimide (DIC) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was purchased from Fluka or Aldrich and used without further purification. Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) dimethylsulfide (DMS) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and used without further purification. Protected amino acids were generally of the L configuration and were obtained commercially from Bachem, Advanced ChemTech, or Neosystem. Purity of these reagents was confirmed by thin layer chromatography, NMR and melting point prior to use. Benzhydrylamine resin (BHA) was a copolymer of styrene - 1% divinylbenzene (100-200 or 200-400 mesh) obtained from Bachem or Advanced Chemtech. Total nitrogen content of these resins were generally between 0.3 - 1.2 meq/g.<br>
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted on a LDC apparatus consisting of Constametric I and III pumps, a Gradient Master solvent programmer and mixer, and a Spectromonitor III variable wavelength UV detector. Analytical HPLC was performed in reversed phase mode using Vydac C18 columns (0.4 x 30 cm). Preparative HPLC separations<br>
were run on Vydac columns (2 x 25 cm).<br><br>
Peptides were preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis by the method generally described by Merrifield, [J. Amer. Chenu Soc, 1963,85,2149], although other equivalent chemical synthesis known in the art could be used as previously mentioned. Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha-amino acid to a suitable resin. Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha-amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, or<br>
by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-a-[l-(9H-fluoren-9-yI)-<br>
methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybeiizyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin. Preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when the desired peptide being synthesized has an unsubstituted amide at the C-terminus.<br>
In general, the amino acids or mimetic are coupled onto the Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin using the Fmoc protected form of amino acid or mimetic, with 2-5 equivalents of amino acid and a suitable coupling reagent. After couplings, the resin may be washed and dried under vacuum. Loading of the amino acid onto the resin may be determined by amino acid analysis of an aliquot of Fmoc-amino acid resin or by determination of Fmoc groups by UV analysis. Any unreacted amino groups may be capped by reacting the resin with acetic anhydride and diisopropylethylamine in methylene chloride.<br>
The resins are carried through several repetitive cycles to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in DMF may be used for this purpose. Preferably 40% piperidine in DMF is utilized.<br>
Following the removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art For example, appropriate reagents for such syntheses arebenzotriazol-1-yloxy-tri- (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), Bromo-tris-pyrroHdino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP), 2-(lH-Benzotriazole-l-y^-ljljSjS-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). Preferred here are HBTU and DIC Other activating agents as described by Barany and Merrifield [The Peptides, Vol. 2, J. Meienhofer, ed, Academic Press, 1979, pp 1-284] maybe utilized. Various reagents such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) and 3&gt;4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-l^,3-benzotriazine (HOOBT)<br><br>
may be added to the coupling mixtures in order to optimize the synthetic cycles. Preferred here is HOBT.<br><br>
Solvents for all washings and couplings were measured to volumes of 10 - 20 ml/g resins. Coupling reactions throughout the synthesis were monitored by the Kaiser ninhydrin test to determine extent of completion [Kaiser et at Anal Biochem. 1970,34,595-598]. Slow reaction kinetics was observed for Fmoc-Arg (Pmc) and for couplings to secondary amines by sterically hindered acids. Any incomplete coupling reactions were either recoupled with freshly prepared activated amino acid or capped by treating the peptide resin with acetic anhydride as described above. The fully assembled peptide-resins were dried in vacuum for several hours.<br>
For each compound, the blocking groups were removed and the peptide cleaved from the resin by the following procedure. The peptide-resins were treated with 100 μL ethanedithiol, 100 μL dimethylsulfide, 300 μL anisole, and 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, per gram of resin, at room<br><br>
temperature for 120 min. The resin is filtered off and the filtrates are precipitated in chilled ethyl ether. The precipitates are centrifiiged and the ether layer is decanted. The residue was washed with two or three volumes of Et20 and recentrifuged. The crude products are dried under<br>
vacuum.<br>
Purification of Crude Peptide Preparations<br>
Purification of the crude peptides was carried out by preparative HPLC. The peptides were applied to the columns in a minimum volume of either AcOH/H20 or 0.1% TFA/H2O.<br>
Gradient elution was generally started at 10% B buffer, 10% -60% B in 90 minutes, (buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H20, buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH3CN) at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. UV detection was<br>
made at 280 nm. Fractions were collected at 1.0 - 2.5 minute intervals and inspected by analytical HPLC. Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.<br>
Purity of the final products was checked by analytical HPLC on a reversed phase column as stated above. Purity of all products was judged to be approximately 95 - 99%. All final products were also subjected to fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) or electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). All products yielded the expected parent M+H ions within acceptable limits.<br>
Utilizing the techniques described above, the compounds of this invention can be synthesized in accordance with the following reaction schemes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
R6 is as previously described.<br>
The linear peptides used herein as the penultimate intermediates in the syntheses of the cyclic peptides of the current invention (Structure 1) are prepared by using conventional solid phase peptide synthesis methodology discussed in the previous section. Each cycle consists of two procedures; the initial deavage of the Fmoc protecting group from the terminal nitrogen in the resin bound chain followed by acylation of the amine function with an Fmoc protected amino acid. The cycle is generally carried out in accordance with the stepwise procedures outlined in Protocol 1. The deprotection is accomplished by using an organic base, for example piperazine, morpholine or piperidine, preferably piperidine in a suitable inert solvent, for example N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The coupling reaction can be carried out by one of the many conditions developed for amide bond formation, for example O-benzotriazol-1-yl N,N,N\NJM:etramelhyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) in the presence of an organic base, for example, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in an inert solvent, for example DMF. Alternatively in the present instance, the amide group can be formed using a carbodiimide, for example, diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) along with an activating agent such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) in a suitable inert solvent such as DMF.<br>
In Reaction Scheme A, in the first cycle of the preparation of the linear polypeptides precursors for the cyclic peptides of Structure I where Z is NHCO, the Fmoc-Linker-BHA Resin<br><br>
represented by Structure 2 is deprotected and condensed with Fmoc-amino acids of Structure 3 to give the resin bound compounds of 4. In this syntheses of the cyclic peptides, it is required that the Fmoc-amino acid 3 contain a key structural requirement which is a suitably protected basic side chain, that when deprotected, can participate in the formation of the intramolecular amide bond. To extend the growing peptide chain, a second cycle incorporates the Fmoc-amino acids 5 to give the compounds of Structure 6. In the third cycle, treatment of the resin linked peptide 6 furnishes the intermediates of Structure 7a where R8 is hydrogen. The intermediates of Structure 7b where R8 is methyl are synthesized as shown in Scheme C.<br>
The intermediates of Structure 7b are prepared from the compounds of Structure 7a, as shown inScheme C. In this procedure, compounds of Structure 7a, prepared by treating compounds of Structure 6 as described in steps 1-5 of Protocol 1, are reacted with an aryl sulfonyl chloride, preferably 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride 23 to produce the compounds of Structure 24. This reaction is carried out in the presence of a proton acceptor, for example pyridine, triethylamine (TEA) or DIPEA, preferably DIPEA in a suitable inert solvent, preferably DMF. N-methylation of the formed sulfonamide group in the washed resin bound compounds of Structure 24 is accomplished under Mitsunobu conditions to produce the compound of Structure 25. In carrying out this reaction the sulfonamides of Structure 24 are reacted with methanol in the presence of diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) and triphenylphosphine using methanol as solvent. After the reaction is complete, the resin bound N-methylsulfonamide of Structure 25 is washed free of residual reagents and byproducts.<br>
In the next steps as set forth in Reaction Scheme A the 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl residue is removed from Structure 25 by reacting 25 with 2-mercaptoethanol and the strong organic base l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in a suitable solvent, preferably DMF, to give the resin bound intermediate of Structure 7b. The third cycle of Reaction Scheme A is completed by coupling compounds of either Structures 7a and 7b with Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH (8) or Fmoc-Cit-OH (9) to give the resin bound compounds of Structure 10.<br>
The next two cycles shown in Reaction Scheme B are carried out by first reacting peptides of Structure 10 with the amino acid Fmoc-(D)-Phe-OH to produce the compound of Structure H and then reacting this compound of Structure H with either one of the amino acid mimetics of Structure 12 or 13 to incorporate these amino acids into the resin bound peptide to give the resin bound pentapeptides of either Structures 14 and 15, depending upon which amino acid mimetics is used. The incorporation of additional amino acid containing carboxylic acid side chains into the linear pentapeptides suitable to ultimately participate in the formation of the cyclic peptides of this invention is accomplished in two ways<br><br>
a.	As seen in Reaction Scheme B, a Fmoc amino acid with a appropriately protected acid side<br>
chain is incorporated into the resin bound pentapeptides 14 and 15. Thus in cycle 6 (Reaction Scheme B) Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH (16) or Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH (17) is incorporated into the growing peptide chain to give the resin bound hexapeptides of Structures 18 and 19 respectively or alternatively,<br>
b.	The resin bound pentapeptides 14 and 15 are N-capped with a cyclic anhydride of<br>
Structure 28' (Reaction Scheme F) for example, maleic anhydride or phthalic anhydride, to give the compounds of Structure 29 and 30, or alternatively<br>
c.	As seen in Reaction Scheme B, the resin bound hexapeptides 18 and 19 may be further<br>
reacted with an additional amino acid to form a heptapeptide before being N-cappedL This is accomplished by the incorporation in the usual manner of an amino acid residue, preferably Fmoc-Nle-OH, to furnish 21 and 22.<br>
N-capping of heptapeptide or hexapeptide produces the terminal amide function group of the compound!. In this maimer, the substitutents X, Y, R   andR are produced. ToN-capthe resin bound hexapeptides (18,19) or heptapeptides (21,22), the polypeptide is first treated with piperidine in DMF to remove the Fmoc protecting group and then is reacted with an acylating agent As shown in Reaction Scheme D to produce the compound of Structure 1 before the formation of Z where X and Y are CH&gt; and R1 IS<br>
f<br>
-HN-C-R2 ,<br>
the resin bound polypeptide of Structure 18 is deprotected and N-acylated to give the resin bound amide of Structure 27 or after deprotection is reacted with an isocyanate to form the ureas of Structure 28 . The N-acylation is carried out under a variety of methods well known to one skilled in the art. Among the methods used are:<br>
(i)    reaction of the terminal amino functionality with a carboxylic acid R2-C02H in a suitable solvent, such as DMF in the presence of HBTU, and an organic base, preferably DIPEA;<br>
(ii)     reaction of the terminal amino functionality with a carboxylic acid chloride R2-COCI in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base&gt; such as pyridine, TEA and DIPEA, preferably DIPEA; or<br>
(iii)   reaction of the terminal amino functionality with a carboxylic acid anhydride of Structure<br><br>
28' as shown in Reaction Scheme F. This Reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane or DMF in the presence of an organic base, preferably DIPEA.<br>
The N-capping reaction in Reaction Scheme D where compounds of Structure 18 are converted to ureas of Structure 28 is carried out by reacting the terminal amino group in the compounds of Structure 28 with an isocyanate R -NCO. This reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane or DMF in the presence an organic base, preferably DIPEA. When the acylation and urea forming reactions are complete, the resin bound products 27 and 28 are washed free of residual reagents and byproducts. By using similar conditions, N-capping of the resin bound polypeptides of Structure .19* 21, and 22 is carried out by fomation of the N-acylated compounds of Structures 33, 35,37 and the ureas of Structure 34,36 and 38 (Reaction Scheme E). However, Reaction Scheme E can be modified to provide R14 groups other than that derived from Nle by utilizing known amino acids other than the compound of Structure 20 in Reaction Scheme B to produce compounds of Structures 2.1 and 22.<br>
Reaction Schemes G and H illustrate the cleavage of remaining protecting groups in the N-capped polypeptides 29,30,33-38 and the concomitant cleavage of the peptides from the solid support This reaction is carried out by using a strong organic acid, preferably trifluoroacetic acid, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent such as dichloromethane and a trace (1%) of water and optionally in the presence of one or more carbocation scavengers, for example ethanedithiol, dimethyl sulfide, triethylsilane and anisole. The polypeptide cleavage solution is filtered free from the solid support, then is diluted with a suitable solvent, preferably diethyl ether, and the formed solids are collected by filtration. The solid polypeptides of Structures 39-44 produced in Reaction Scheme H may be purified by reversed phase chromatography by using a preparative CI 8 column.<br>
With the appropriate functionalities thus now available to form the intramolecular amide bond, the N-capped linear polypeptides are subjected to amide forming reaction conditions well known in the art Accordingly each in turn of the the linear peptides 31,32 (Reaction Scheme G) and 39-44 (Reaction Scheme I) is dissolved in an inert solvent, for example DMSO, and by the addition of a tertiary amine base, for example N-methyl morpholine the solution is adjusted to an apparent pH of 8, prior to the addition of an amide forming reagent, for example BOP. The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature of between zero degrees and 40 °C, preferably at about room temperature. The reaction i§ allowed to proceed until it is judged to be complete. Common methods, used by those of average skill, to monitor the progress of a reaction are for example, TLC or analytical HPLC. After removal of the reaction solvents in vacuo the crude cyclic peptides of Structure I where Z is NHCO as shown in Reaction Scheme I may be<br><br>
purified by reversed phase chromatography using a preparative C18 column. In this manner Compound of Structure _l_are produced where Z is NHCO Bridge.<br>
The cyclic disulfide peptides of Structure 1 where Z is S-S are prepared by methodologies, outlined in Reaction Schemes similar to those described above in Reaction Schemes A through H for the preparation of the lactams of Structure 1 where Z is NHCO. The penultimate linear polypeptides are assembled in a like manner, with the exception that amino acids, that contain protected thiol side chain residues, for example Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH, are incorporated at the appropriate positions of the growing resin bound polypeptide, preferably in cycle 1 and 6. This preparation of the resin bound linear polypeptides is illustrated in Reaction Schemes J and K. As previously described and shown in Scheme L, the resin bound linear hexapeptide 52, after removal of the Fmoc protecting group group, maybe N-capped either by acylation to give 56 or by reaction with an isocyanate to form the urea 57. In the same way the resin bound hexapeptide 53, and the resin bound heptapeptides 54 and 55 are converted to the corresponding N-acylated derivatives 58,60 and 62 and the urea derivatives 59,61 and 63 (Reaction Scheme M).<br>
In Reaction Scheme N, the N-capped resin bound linear hexapeptide 56 is treated with a strong acid, preferably trifluoroacetic acid, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent such as dichloromethane and optionally in the presence of one or more carbocation scavengers, for example ethanedithiol, dimethyl sulfide, triethylsilane and anisole. This causes cleavage of all side chain protecting groups as well as cleavage of the linear peptide from the solid support The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature of between 0 °C and 35 °C, preferably at room temperature. The polypeptide cleavage solution is filtered free from the solid support, then is diluted with a suitable solvent, preferably diethyl ether, and the formed solids are collected by filtration. The solid polypeptide of Structure 64 thus produced optionally maybe purified by reversed phase chromatography by using a preparative C18 column. The linear hexapeptide 64 is then treated under oxidative conditions well known to one skilled in the art, that can induce thiols to form a disulfide bond. Accordingly a dilute aqueous solution of 64 is adjusted to pH 8.0 using a moderately weak inorganic base, preferably ammonium hydroxide, and then oxygen was bubbled into the solution until the cyclization was judged to be complete, using standard methods, for example TLC or HPLC. After removal of the reaction solvents by lyophillization, the crude cyclic peptide (£ Z= S-S) prepared and isolated in this manner, may be purified by reversed phase chromatography by using a preparative CI 8 column.<br>
Under similar conditions to those described hereinbefore in connection with Reaction Schemes H and I, the resin bound linear polypeptides 58-63 as shown in Reaction Schemes O and P, are deprotected and cleaved from the solid support to give the linear peptides 65-70<br><br>
(Reaction Scheme 0), which are then oxidativdy cyclized, as described above, to give the corresponding compounds of Structure 1 (Reaction Scheme P).<br>
The Fmoc-amino acids used in the preparation of the peptides described above, as well as the acylating agents and isocyanates used to N-cap the polypeptides are known compounds that are commercially available. The Fmoc-amino acids 12, including its species, the compound of Structure 13, used in Reaction Scheme B, are prepared as described herein by methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the practice of organic chemistry. In Scheme Q, the preparation of Fmoc-amino acid species of the compound of Structure 12 from cyclic ketones is outlined. These species which are the Structure .12 and Structure 13,79 and 80 are prepared in the same way as the species of Structure 75 as outlined in the procedure of Scheme Q, The 4-phenylcyclohexanones of Structure 71 are converted to the hydantoins of Structure 72 by treatment with ammonium carbonate and potassium cyanide. The reaction is conveniently carried out in aqueous ethanol mixture at a temperature of from 50 °C to 90 °Q preferably between 80 °C and 90 °C. Direct hydrolysis of the hydantoins to the amino acids of Structure 73 require a prolonged treatment with strong base, for example with 6N sodium hydroxide solution or with barium hydroxide at reflux temperature. Alternatively, compounds of Structure 72 can be converted to the bis-Boc derivatives of Structure 74. The reaction is carried out using tert-butyl dicarbonate [(Boc)2O] in an inert solvent, preferably tetrahydroforan (THF), in the presence of an organic amine base, preferably TEA. and a catalyst, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) at a temperature of from zero degrees to room temperature, preferably at room temperature. The bis-Boc hydantoins of Structure 74 are readily converted to the amino acids of Structure 73. The reaction is accomplished using IN sodium hydroxide in an inert solvent, preferably dimethoxyethane (DME) at from zero degrees to 50 °C, preferably at about room temperature. Protection of the amino functionality with an Fmoc group in a compound of Structure 73 is carried out under a variety of reaction conditions to give the compound of Structure 75 which is the Fmoc-amino acid species of the compound of Structure 12, The reaction may conveniently be performed by treatment of a solution of the amino acid 73 in a mixture of THF or dioxane, preferably dioxane and aqueous sodium carbonate with 9-fluorenylmethoxychloroformate (FmocCl) at a temperature of from zero degrees to room temperature, preferably at room temperature. Alternatively, N-(9-<br>
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)succmimide (FmocOSu) is added to a solution of the amino acid 73 in aqueous acetonitrile containing an organic tertiary amine base, preferably TEA. The reaction is run at from zero degrees to room temperature, preferably at room temperature. In another variation of the procedure, DME is evaporated from the hydrolysis mixture in the     conversion of 24 to 73 and the reaction is adjusted to -pH 11. The resulting solution of the sodium salt of 73 is then treated in situ with FmocOSu or FmocCl in dioxane at a temperature of<br><br>
from zero degrees to room temperature, preferably at room temperature. In the same maimer, as in Reaction scheme Q, the tetralones 76, the N-aryl-4-ketopiperidines 77, and the cyclohexanone derivatives 28 can be converted to the corresponding Fmoc-amino acids of Structures 13,79 and 80, all of which along with 73 form subgenera of Structure 12 utilized in Reaction Scheme B.<br>
In Reaction Scheme Q, the compounds of Structure 73 where R4 represents a linear or branched lower alkoxy and both R and R is hydrogen in the sub genus Structure 82, may be prepared by O-alkylation of the compound of Structure 81 as shown in Reaction Scheme R. Where R16 represents an unbranched lower alkyl moiety, the alkylation is carried out by using a primary alkyl halide of Structure R1 halide in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate, for example, sodium or potassium carbonate. The alkyl halide maybe a chloro, bromo or iodo derivative, preferably an alkyl iodide. The reaction may be conveniently carried out in an inert solvent that promotes SN2 displacement reactions, for example acetone, 2-butanone or N,N* dimethylformamide, preferably acetone, at a temperature of from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solution, preferably the reflux temperature. When R16 represents a branched lower alkyl group, e.g., 2-propyl, the alkylation of the compound of Structure 81 to produce the compound of Structure 82 is carried out by using a secondary alkyl halide of Structure R16halide in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate, e.g., potassium carbonate- The secondary alkyl halide is preferably a secondary alkyl iodide, for example, 2-iodopropane. The reaction may be conveniently carried out in an inert solvent, preferably N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature of from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solution, preferably at about 100 °C.<br>
4-Arylcyclohexanones of Structure 71 which are the starting materials in Reaction Scheme Q can be prepared by methods that are well known to one of ordinary skill in the practice of organic chemistry. As outlined in Scheme S, treatment of the aryl halides of Structure 83&gt; where X1 represents bromo or iodo with an alkyl metal reagent, preferably t-butyl lithium, results in a transmetalation reaction to give the corresponding aryl lithium of Structure 84- Tke reaction is conveniently carried out at -78 °C by the addition of a solution of the alkyl lithium into a solution of a compound of Structure 83 an inert anhydrous solvent, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, preferably tetrahydrofuran. The aryl lithium of Structure 84 produced in this manner, is then reacted in situ with a solution of the monoketal of cyclohexane-l,4-dione (85) in an suitable inert solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, while the reaction temperature is maintained below -60 °C, preferably at about -78 °C to! give the carbinols of Structure 86. The compounds of Structure 87 are obtained by the dehydration of the carbinols of Structure 86* The reaction is conveniently carried out using a strong organic acid catalyst, preferably p-toluenesulfonic acid in an inert solvent, for example benzene or toluene, preferably benzene, at<br><br>
the reflux temperature of the solvent. The formed water is removed from the reaction mixture by means of a Dean Stark apparatus to enable the reaction to go to completion. Compounds of Structure 88 are produced by hydrogenation of the olefins of Structure 87. The reaction is conveniently carried out using a noble metal catalyst, for example palladium on carbon, in a hydrogen atmosphere in an inert solvent, for example ethanol or ethyl acetate. The hydrogenation is usually carried out at room temperature and 40 psi of hydrogen, however if the aryl ring in Structure 87 contains a group prone to hydrogenolysis, e.g., if R3, R4 or R5 represents chloro, the reaction pressure is kept at about 5 psi. Compounds of Structure 88 may be also obtained directly from carbinols of Structure 86 by reductive elimination of the hydroxyl group. In this reaction a solution of the compound of Structure 86 (R = R =H and R = OMe) in an inert solvent, for example dichloromethane, is treated with a Lewis acid, such as boron trifluoride etherate, and a reducing agent, for example triefhylsilane, at a temperature of from zero degrees to room temperature. Removal of the ketal protecting group in compounds of Structure 88 gives the ketone of formula 71, which is the starting material for Reaction Scheme Q for preparing the Fmoc-amino acid species of Structure 75 of the compound of Structure 12. The reaction is conveniently carried out in acetone or 2-butanone, preferably acetone under acid catalysis, for example 4N hydrochloric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid at from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at the reflux temperature.<br>
5-Substituted-beta-tetralones of Structure 76 shown in Reaction Scheme Q which is the starting material for preparing compound of Struture 13 are known compounds, or if they are not known they can be prepared by methods that are well known to one of ordinary skill in the field of organic chemistry. In the present instance, compounds of Structure 76 are basically prepared by two methods outlined in Reaction Schemes T and U As shown in Scheme T, a 2-<br><br>
substituted hydrocinnamic acid of Structure 90 is converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride of Structure 91. This conversion can be carried out by several methods, for example by treatment of the hydrocinnamic acid with oxalyl chloride, optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide, in an inert solvent, such as benzene or dichloromethane, preferably dichloromethane. The reaction may be conveniently carried out at a temperature of from zero degrees to room temperature, preferably at room temperature. Alternatively the compound of Structure 90 is reacted with an acyl chloride forming reagent such as sulfuryl chloride in an inert solvent, for example benzene or toluene, preferably toluene at a temperature between room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solution, preferably at the reflux temperature. The diazoketone of Structure 92 is prepared by treatment of the thus formed acyl halide of Structure 91 in an inert solvent, e.g., dichloromethane with an excess of a freshly prepared ethereal solution of diazomethane. The combination of reagents is conveniently carried out at ice bath temperature and the reaction is then allowed to proceed at a temperature of from<br><br>
zero degrees to room temperature, preferably at room temperature. As shown in Reaction Scheme T, cyclization of the diazoketone of Structure 92 to furnish the tetralone of Structure 76 is promoted by rhodium (II) acetate dimer in an inert solvent, e.g., dichloromethane. The reaction is normally carried out at from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solution, preferably at the reflux temperature.<br>
Compounds of Structure 76, which is a starting material in Reaction Scheme Q, wherein R6 represents a linear or branched lower alkoxy group can be prepared as shown in Reaction Scheme U from compounds of Structure 93. In Reaction Scheme U, the compounds of Structure 94 where R15 is an unbranched lower alkyl moiety are prepared by per-O-alkyiation of the naphthalenediol of Structure 93 with a primary alkyl iodide or bromide, preferably an iodide, in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal carbonate, for example, sodium or potassium carbonate. The reaction may be carried out in an inert solvent, preferably N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature of from room temperature to 100 °C, preferably at 35 °C The compounds of Structure 97 where R15 is a branched lower alkyl are prepared in two steps from the 2-tetralone of Structure 94. The tetralone of Structure 95 is subjected to dehydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, such as palladium metal (10% on carbon) in a suitable high boiling solvent such as p-cymene to give the aromatized compound of Structure 96. The naphthol of Structure 96 is then O-alkylated with a secondary alkyl iodide in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal carbonate, preferably cesium carbonate to furnish the compound of Structure 97. The reaction may be conveniently carried out in an inert solvent, preferably N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature of from room temperature to 100 °C, preferably at about 40 °C<br>
The tetralones of Structures 76 are produced by reduction of the compounds of Structures 94 and 97 under dissolving metal conditions, followed by the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the intermediate enol ethers. The transformation is conveniently carried out by the portionwise addition of a large excess of an alkali metal, such as sodium or potassium, preferably sodium, to a boiling solution of the substrate in an lower alcohol, preferably ethanol until the starting material is consumed. The tetralones of Structures 76 are obtained by treatment of a solution of the isolated intermediate enol ethers with a strong acid catalyst, preferably p-toluenesulfonic acid.

In preparing the compounds of Structure 77&gt; utilized in Reaction Scheme Q as starting materials in producing the compounds of formula 79 which are the Fmoc-amino acid species of<br><br>
the compound of Structure 12, the compound of Structure 98 is used as a starting material. This is shown in Reaction Scheme V. In Reaction Scheme V, compounds of Structure 100 can be prepared by reactions that are known per se. For example, they can be prepared by coupling the secondary amine of Structure 98 with an aryl bromide or iodide, preferably an aryl iodide of Structure 99 (Reaction Scheme V). The coupling reaction is catalyzed by a noble metal catalyst, preferably tri(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium, in the presence of a chelating phosphine ligand, preferably tri-o-tolylphosphine, and a hindered alkoxide base such as sodium tert-butoxide. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert atmosphere using an anhydrous solvent such as dioxane or toluene, preferably dioxane, at a temperature of from 60 °C to the reflux temperature, preferably at90°C. Removal of the carbonyl protecting group in compound 100 to give compounds of Structure 77 can be carried out by a variety of methods well known in the field of organic chemistry. For example, the deprotection can be achieved by treatment of a solution of compound 100 in a low boiling ketone such as acetone or 2-butanone with an aqueous mineral acid solution, for example 6N hydrochloric acid at a temperature of from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the mixture, preferably at the reflux temperature. The compound of Structure 100 when treated in this manner with an aqueous mineral acid forms, in Reaction Scheme V, the compound of Structure 72.- The compound of Structure 77 as demonstrated in the discussion of Reaction Scheme Q is the intermediate for the compound of Structure 79 which is the species of acid of Structure 12 wherein Q is<br><br><br>

As shown in Reaction Scheme W, (3-methyl(Nin-Mes)lryptophan 109 was prepared by using the method previously described by Boteju, L.W., Wenger K., and Hruby, V.J. TetLett., 33,7491 (1992). In the first step the nitrogen in imns-indole-3-acrylic acid 101 is protected by conversion to the corresponding mesitylenesulfonamide 102. The reaction is carried out by treating the indole acid 101 with a excess (&gt; 2 equiv.) of a solution of an alkyl or aryl lithium reagent, for example phenyl lithium or n-butyllithium, preferably n-butyllithium in an inert solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of from -40 °C to about -100 °C, most conveniently at -78 °C While the reaction is maintained at about -78 °C, the formed dilithiated species is then reacted with mesitylenesulfonyl chloride to furnish the mesitylenesulfonamide 102. The N-protected indole acrylic acid 102 is then coupled with the chiral auxiliary (R)-4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone (preparation see Nicolas et al., J. Org Chem. 1993,58,766-770.)as its N-lithiated species 104 to give the chiral acrylamide 105. The coupling was accomplished via a mixed anhydride formed from 102. To form the mixed anhydride 103,the N-protected indole acrylic acid 102 was reacted with a suitable acyl chloride, for example t-butyl chloroformate, 2,4,6 trichlorobenzoyl chloride or pivaloyl chloride, preferably pivaloyl chloride in the presence of an tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, preferably triethylamine. The criteria that make possible the choice of a suitable acyl chloride to form the anhydride 103 are well established and are known by one of ordinary skill in organic chemistry. The anhydride formation is nm in an inert solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran at an initial temperature of between -100 °C and 0 °C, preferably at about -78 °C. The reaction is allowed to go to completion at a temperature of between -78 °C and 0 °C degrees, preferably at about 0 °C The thus formed mixed anhydride 103 is then reacted in situ with a solution of N-lithiated (R)-4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone 104, previously prepared by treating a solution of (R)-4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone in an inert solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, with an equimolar amount of a solution of an alkyl or aryl lithium reagent, for example phenyl lithium or n-butyUithium, preferably n-butyllithium in an inert solvent, for example, hexane at a temperature of between -100 °C and zero degrees, preferably at about -78 °C. The coupling reaction which yields the chiral acrylamide 105 is carried out at an initial temperature of between —100 °C and zero degrees, preferably at about -78 °C, and after all the reagents are combined the reaction is allowed to proceed at a temperature of between -78 °C and room temperature, preferably at about room temperature.<br>
The highlight of the transformation of the chiral acrylamide 105 into 106, is the controlled generation of the two new contiguous chiral centers present in 106. The reaction involves the stereoselective 1,4- conjugate addition (Michael addition) of a methyl cuprate, formed in situ from cuprous bromide-dimethylsulfide complex and methyl magnesium bromide,<br><br>
to the Micheal acceptor, the oc,p-unsaturated carbonyi system present in 105. The resultant metal-chelated enolate is then directly halogenated with a halogenating agent, preferably N-bromosuccinimide, to give 106. Again, as in the case of the Michael addition, the incorporation of the bromo atom is stereoselective, controlled by the bulky phenyl group on the chiral auxiliary<br>
which effectively shields the si face of both the a,3-unsaturated acyloxazolidinone system and the intermediate metal-chelated enolate from attack from incoming reagents. To prepare the methyl cuprate, a solution of methyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether is added to a solution of cuprous bromide-dimethylsulfide (1:1) complex in an inert solvent, for example dimethyl sulfide or tetrahydrofiiran, preferably a mixture thereof. The reaction is run at a temperature of between -78 °C and room temperature, preferably at -4 °C Instead of methyl magnesium bromide, any lower alkyl bromide can be added to form R17 where R17 is a lower alkyl group other than methyl. To this formed solution of methyl cuprate, is added in situ a solution of the<br>
a,P-unsaturated acyloxazolidinone 105 in an inert solvent, preferably tetrahydrofiiran. The methyl cuprate addition is run initially at a temperature of between -30° C and room temperature, preferably at -4 °C and then is allowed to proceed at room temperature. When it is judged that the reaction is completed (e.g. analysis by TLC or HPLC), it is then cooled to a temperature of between -100 °C and -40 °C, preferably at about -78 °C, whereupon a solution of a halogenating agent, preferably N-bromosuccinimide in an inert solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran is added. The reaction is then allowed to proceed at a temperature of between 0 °C and room temperature, preferably at about room temperature to give after isolation, the bromide 106. The bromide is the displaced by azide ion with a concomitant inversion of configuration. This transformation is accomplished by reaction of the bromide 106 with tetra-butylammonium azide in the presence of excess sodium azide in an inert solvent, for example acetonitrile to give the azide 107. The reaction is conveniently run at a temperature of between 80 °C and room temperature, preferably at about room temperature. Treatment of 107 and an alkali metal hydroxide, or example sodium, potassium or lithium hydroxide, preferably lithium hydroxide in the presence of hydrogen peroxide resulted in the hydrolysis of the chiral auxiliary to give the azido acid 108. The hydrolysis reaction is run in an inert solvent, preferably water, at a temperature of between 0 °C and room temperature, preferably at about 0 °G Hydrogenation of<br>
the a-azido acid 108 gives the p-methyl(Nin-Mes)tryptophan which is immediately converted<br>
to the corresponding N(a)-Fmoc-p-methyl(Nin-Mes)tryptophan 109. The hydrogenation of 108 is carried out over a noble metal catalyst, preferably 10% Pd/C, in an inert solvent, for example a lower alkanol, preferably methanol at low pressure( 
 <br>
bicarbonate, and a Fmoc N-protecting group forming reagent, for example 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (Fmoc-Cl) or 9-fluorenylmethyl-N-succinimidyl carbonate (Fmoc-OSu), preferably Fmoc-Osu to furnish 109. The reaction is conveniently run at a temperature of between 0 °C and room temperature, preferably at about room temperature. The compound of formula 109 is a species of amino acid of Structure 5 in Reaction Scheme A.<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY EXAMPLE:<br>
Example A:	Agonist Assay<br>
Method<br>
Description: HEK 293 cells transfected with either the MC-4 receptor or MC-1 receptor were<br>
grown in 96 well plates. The cells were stimulated with either lOOnM NDP-OCMSH or screening<br>
compounds. Cyclic AMP was extracted from the cells and concentrations were determined using a Biotrak-cAMP SPA assay. Agonists were identified as those compounds causing an increase in cAMP.<br>
Cell Culture: HEK 293 cells transfected with either the MC-4 receptor or MC-1 receptor were<br>
2 co   ired in 75cm flasks in D-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 500μg/ml G418. Cells were<br>
trypsinized and split 1:3 into 96 well flat-bottom tissue culture treated plates. Cells were<br>
stimulated at confluence (day 2-4).<br>
cAMP Response: Compounds serially diluted in 100% DMSO were further diluted 1:200 (2.5JLU<br>
compound dilution + 500JL11 media) in D-MEM containing 10%FBS and O.lmM IBMX. For<br>
unstimulated cells, 2μl of DMSO was added to 500fil of media. For NDP-CXMSH stimulated<br>
cells, 2.5μL of 20JJIM NDP-OCMSH in 100% DMSO was added to 500|0l of media (final cone. lOOnM). Final concentration of DMSO in all wells was 0.5%.<br>
Note: Each sample was run in duplicate on separate plates<br>
Culture medium was removed from confluent 96 well culture plates and replaced with 200μl of above dilutions into the appropriate wells. The plates were incubated for lhr at RT. The media was removed, and the plates were washed Ix with 200μ1 well of PBS. CAMP was extracted by<br>
the addition of 60μl 70% ethanol (stored in the refrigerator). After a 30min extraction period, l0μl ethanol extract was transferred to the cAMP assay plate or samples were stored at -20°C until the cAMP assay was performed.<br><br>
cAMP Assay: The extracted samples and all reagents included in the kit were brought to room temperature. To a 96 well OptiPlate, 10μl ethanol extract, 40μl assay buffer, 50ul [125I]cAMP, 50μl antiserum and 50μl SPA beads were added. The total well volume after addition was 200|il. The plates were sealed and incubated for 15-20 hr at room temperature. [125I]cAMP binding to the SPA beads was determined by counting each plate for 2 minutes on a Packard TopCount   .<br>
Note: Each plate contained samples of controls for unstimulated cells and NDP-OCMSH for stimulated cells.<br>
