COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "A COMPOUND OF FORMULA (I)"<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM (CANADA)  LTD.,  of 2100 Cunard Street, Laval, Quebec H7S 2G5, Canada<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
HEPATITIS C INHIBITOR TRI-PEPTIDES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, process for their synthesis, compositions and methods for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV1 infection. In particular, the present invention provides novel peptide analogs, pharmaceutical compositions containing such analogs and methods for using these analogs in the treatment of HCV infection. The present invention also provides processes and intermediates for the synthesis of these peptide analogs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of post-transfusion and community-acquired non-A non-B hepatitis worldwide. It is estimated that over 150 million people worldwide are infected by the virus. A high percentage of carriers become chronically infected and many progress to chronic liver disease, so-called chronic hepatitis C. This group is in turn at high risk for serious liver disease such as iiver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and terminal liver disease leading to death.<br>
The mechanism by which HCV establishes viral persistence and causes a high rate of chronic liver disease has not been thoroughly elucidated. It is not known how HCV interacts with and evades the host immune system. In addition, the roles of cellular and humoral immune responses in protection against HCV infection and disease have yet to be established. Immunoglobulins have been reported for prophylaxis of transfusion-associated viral hepatitis, however, the Center for Disease Control does not presently recommend immunoglobulins treatment for this purpose. The lack of an effective protective immune response is hampering the development of a vaccine or adequate post-exposure prophylaxis measures, so in the near-term, hopes are firmly pinned on antiviral interventions.<br>
Various clinical studies have been conducted with the goal of identifying pharmaceutical agents capable of effectively treating HCV infection in patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis C. These studies have involved the use of interferon-alpha, alone and in combination with other antiviral agents. Such studies have shown that a substantial number of the participants do not respond to these therapies, and of those that do respond favorably, a large proportion were found to relapse after termination of treatment.<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
Until recently, interferon (IFN) was the only available therapy of proven benefit approved in the clinic for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However the sustained response rate is low, and interferon treatment also induces severe side-effects (i.e. retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, depression) that diminish the quality of life of treated patients. Recently, interferon in combination with ribavirin has been approved for patients non-responsive to IFN alone. However, the side effects caused by IFN are not alleviated with this combination therapy.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection that overcomes the limitations of existing pharmaceutical therapies.<br>
HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (henceforth referred to as NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral repl"tcase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally encoded enzymes that are essential for the replication of the virus. In this vein, patent application WO 97/06804 describes the (-) enantiomer of the nucleoside analogue cytosine-1,3-oxathiolane (also known as 3TC) as active against HCV. This compound, although reported as safe in previous clinical trials against HIV and HBV, has yet to be clinically proven active against HCV and its mechanism of action<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
against the virus has yet to be reported.<br>
Intense efforts to discover compounds which inhibit the NS3 protease or RNA helicase of HCV have led to the following disclosures:<br>
•	US patent 5,633,388 describes heterocyclic-substituted carboxamides and analogues as being active against HCV. These compounds are directed against the helicase activity of the NS3 protein of the virus but clinical tests have not yet been reported.<br>
•	A phenanthrenequinone has been reported by Chu et al., (Tel. Lett., (1996), 7229-7232) to have activity against the HCV NS3 protease in vitro. No further development on this compound has been reported.<br>
•	A paper presented at the Ninth International Conference on Antiviral Research, Urabandai, Fukyshima, Japan (1996) (Antiviral Research, (1996), 30,1, A23 (abstract 19)) reports thiazolidine derivatives to be inhibitory to the HCV protease.<br>
Several studies have reported compounds inhibitory to other serine proteases, such as human leukocyte elastase. One family of these compounds is reported in WO 95/33764 (Hoechst Marion Roussel, 1995). The peptides disclosed in this application are morpholinylcarbonyl-benzoyl-peptide analogues that are structurally different from the peptides of the present invention.<br>
•	WO 98/17679 from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. discloses inhibitors of serine protease, particularly, Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease. These inhibitors are peptide analogues based on the NS5A/5B natural substrate. Although several tripeptides are disclosed, all of these peptide analogues contain C-terminal activated carbonyl function as an essential feature. These analogues were also reported to be active against other serine protease and are therefore not specific for HCV NS3 protease.<br>
•	Hoffman LaRoche has also reported hexapeptides that are proteinase inhibitors useful as antiviral agents for the treatment of HCV infection. These peptides contain an aldehyde or a boronic acid at the C-terminus.<br>
•	Steinkuhler et al. and Ingallinella et al. have published on NS4A-4B product inhibition (Biochemistry (1998), 37, 8899-8905 and 8906-8914). However, the peptides and peptide analogues presented do not include nor do they lead to the<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
design of the peptides of the present invention.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that it provides tripeptides that are inhibitory to the NS3 protease of the hepatitis C virus.<br>
A further advantage of one aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that these peptides specifically inhibit the NS3 protease and do not show significant inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 300 uM against other serine proteases such as human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), or bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin, or cysteine proteases such as human liver cathepsin B (Cat B).<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that it provides small peptides of low molecular weight that may be capable of penetrating cell membranes and may be active in cell culture and in vivo with good pharmacokinetic profile.<br>

As described hereinabove the P1 segment of the compounds of formula l is a cyclobutyl or cyclopropyl ring, both optionally substituted with R1<br>
Preferably, R1 is H, C1-3 alkyl, C3.5 cycloalkyl, or C2-4 alkenyl optionally substituted with halo. More preferably R1 is ethyl, vinyl, cyclopropyl, 1 or 2-bromoethyl or 1 or 2-bromovinyl. Most preferably, R1 is vinyl.<br>
When R1 is not H, then P1 is preferably a cyclopropyl system of formula:<br><br>
i     wherein C1 and C2 each represent an asymmetric carbon atom at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclopropyl ring. Notwithstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds of formula I, the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds of formula I can exist as racemic mixtures of diastereoisomers. As illustrated in the examples hereinafter, the racemic mixtures<br>
i     can be prepared and thereafter separated into individual optical isomers, or these optical isomers can be prepared by chiral synthesis.<br>
Hence, the compound of formula I can exist as a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers at carbon 1 but wherein R1, at carbon 2 is orientated syn to the<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
carbonyl at position 1, represented by the radical:<br><br>
or the compound of formula I can exist as a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers wherein R1 at position 2 is orientated anti to the carbonyl at position 1, represented by the radical:<br><br>
In turn, the racemic mixtures can be separated into individual optical isomers.<br>
A most interesting finding of this invention pertains to the addition of a R1, substituent on the carbon 2 as well as the spatial orientation of the P1 segment. The finding concerns the configuration of the asymmetric carbon 1. A preferred embodiment is one wherein R1, is not H and carbon 1 has the R configuration.<br><br>
More explicitly, the introduction of a substituent (R1 at C2 has an impact on the potency when R1 is introduced in a way that C1 has the R configuration. For example compounds 901 {1R,2S} and 203 (1R,2R) have activities of 25 and 82 nM respectively. When compared to the unsubstituted cyclopropyl compound 111 (475 nM), a substantial increase in potency is observed. Moreover, as shown for<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
compounds 901 and 203 when carbon 1 has the R configuration, HCV NS3 protease inhibition is further enhanced by the configuration of the substituent R1 (e.g. alkyl or alkylene) at carbon 2 of the cyclopropyl ring, e.g. the compound that possesses R1 "syn" to the carboxyl has greater potency (25 nM) than the "antf enantiomer (82 nM). We can see the effect of the R vs. S configuration at C1 by comparing compounds 801 (1R.2S) and its corresponding (1S.2S) isomer which have potencies of 6 nM and &gt;10 uM respectively, a difference of over 1500 fold!!<br>
Therefore a most preferred compound is an optical isomer having the R1, substituent and the carbonyl in a syn orientation in the following absolute configuration:<br><br>
In the case where R, is ethyl, for example, the asymmetric carbon atoms at positions 1 and 2 have the R,R configuration.<br>

PROCESS<br>
The compounds of the present invention were synthesized according to a general process as illustrated in scheme I (wherein CPG is a carboxyl protecting group and APG is an amino protecting group):<br><br>
Briefly, the P1, P2, and P3 can be linked by well known peptide coupling techniques. The P1, P2, and P3 groups may be linked together in any order as long as the final<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
compound corresponds to peptides of Formula I. For example, P3 can be linked to P2-P1 ; or P1 linked to P3-P2.<br>
Generally, peptides are elongated by deprotecting the ct-amino group of the N-terminal residue and coupling the unprotected carboxyl group of the next suitably N-protected amino acid through a peptide linkage using the methods described. This deprotection and coupling procedure is repeated until the desired sequence is obtained. This coupling can be performed with the constituent amino acids in stepwise fashion, as depicted in Scheme I, or by solid phase peptide synthesis according to the method originally described in Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1963), 85, 2149-2154, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Coupling between two amino acids, an amino acid and a peptide, or two peptide fragments can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide) method, active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, Woodward reagent K-method, carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide method) can be enhanced by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.<br>
More explicitly, the coupling step involves the dehydrative coupling of a free carboxyl of one reactant with the free amino group of the other reactant in the presence of a coupling agent to form a linking amide bond. Descriptions of such coupling agents are found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry", 2nd reved., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993). Examples of suitable coupling agents are /V,/V"-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of /V,/V-dicyclohexy!carbodiimide or /V-ethyl-/V"-[(3-dimethyiamino)propyl]carbodiimide. A practical and useful coupling agent is the commercially available (benzotriazol-1 -yloxy)tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 2-(1H-benzotriazo-1-yl)-/V, N, N; /V"-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate. Still another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-/V,/V,/V,/V-tetrarnethy!uronium hexafluorophosphate.<br><br>
WO OU/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
The coupling reaction is conducted in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. An excess of a tertiary amine, e.g. diisopropylethylamine, /V-methylmorpholine or A/-methylpyrrolidine, is added to maintain the reaction mixture at a pH of about 8. The reaction temperature usually ranges between 0°C and 50°C and the reaction time usually ranges between 15 min and 24 h.<br>
When a solid phase synthetic approach is employed, the C-terminal carboxylic acid is attached to an insoluble carrier (usually polystyrene). These insoluble carriers contain a group that will react with the carboxylic group to form a bond that is stable to the elongation conditions but readily cleaved later. Examples of which are: chloro-or bromomethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, trytil resin and 2-methoxy-4-alkoxy-benzylaloconol resin.<br>
Many of these resins are commercially available with the desired C-terminal amino acid already incorporated. Alternatively, the amino acid can be incorporated on the solid support by known methods (Wang, S.-S., J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1973), 95,1328; Atherton, E.; Shepard, R.C. "Solid-phase peptide synthesis; a practical approach" IRL Press: Oxford, (1989); 131-148). In addition to the foregoing, other methods of peptide synthesis are described in Stewart and Young, "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", 2nd ed., Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL (1984); Gross, Meienhofer, Udenfriend, Eds., The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9, Academic Press, New-York, (1980-1987); Bodansky et a!., The Practice of Peptide Synthesis" Springer-Verlag, New-York (1984), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The functional groups of the constituent amino acids generally must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid formation of undesired bonds. The protecting groups that can be used are listed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The a-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected as an ester (CPG) that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include: 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilylethyl and f-butyl, 2) aralkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, or 3) esters that can be cleaved by<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
mild base treatment or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.<br>
The a-amino group of each amino acid to be coupled to the growing peptide chain must be protected (APG). Any protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of such groups include: 1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or 2) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as terf-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alky] carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl; and 7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. The preferred a-amino protecting group is either Boc or Fmoc. Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available.<br>
The a-amino protecting group of the newly added amino acid residue is cleaved prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethahe, or HCI in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0°C and room temperature (RT) usually 20 -22°C.<br>
Any of the amino acids having side chain functionalities must be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above-described groups. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate protecting groups for these side chain functionalities depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide. The selection of such protecting groups is important in that the group must not be removed during the deprotection and coupling of the a-amino group.<br>
For example, when Boc is used as the a-amino protecting group, the following side<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
chain protecting group are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect the amino side chain of amino acids such as Lys and Arg; acetamidomethyl, benzyl (Bn), or t-butylsuifonyl moieties can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect the hydroxy containing side chains of serine, threonine or hydroxyproline; and benzyl esters can be used to protect the carboxy containing side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.<br>
When Fmoc is chosen for the a-amine protection, usually tert-butyl  based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for lysine and arginine, tert-butyl ether for serine, threonine and hydroxyproline, and fert-butyl ester for aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Triphenylmethyl (Trityl) moiety can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine.<br>
Once the elongation of the peptide is completed all of the protecting groups are removed. When a liquid phase synthesis is used, the protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups. These procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
When a solid phase synthesis is used, the peptide is cleaved from the resin simultaneously with the removal of the protecting groups. When the Boc protection method is used in the synthesis, treatment with anhydrous HF containing additives such as dimethyl sulfide, anisole, thioanisole, or p-cresol at 0°C is the preferred method for cleaving the peptide from the resin. The cleavage of the peptide can also be accomplished by other acid reagents such as trifiuoromethanesulfonic acid/trifluoroacetic acid mixtures. If the Fmoc protection method is used, the N-terminal Fmoc group is cleaved with reagents described earlier. The other protecting groups and the peptide are cleaved from the resin using solution of trifluoroacetic acid and various additives such as anisole, etc.<br>

Useful leaving groups in IXb include halogens (X = CI, Br, I) or sulfonate esters (mesylate, tosylate or triflate). The allylic alcohol functionality in IXb is protected with hydroxyl protecting groups well known in the art (e.g. acetate, silyl, acetals).<br>
b)	In a second step, the hydroxyl function of monoalkylated derivative IXc is de-protected and converted to a suitable electrophilic function X such as described above for compound IXb.<br>
c)	Cyclization of IXd to cyclobutane derivative IXe is carried out by treatment with a<br><br><br>
base (metal hydrides, alkoxides), followed by hydrolysis using aqueous mineral acids and neutralization with a mild base. At this stage, syn and anfAisomers of IXe can be separated by flash chromatography.<br>
d) Optionally, the double bond in IXe can also be hydrogenated under standard conditions to yield the corresponding saturated derivative IXf.<br>

After shaking for 1 hour, the wells were drained, the resins were washed with 1.5 mL of DMF and the coupling was repeated once more under the same conditions. The resins were then washed as described above and the cycle was repeated with the next amino acid.<br>
The capping groups were introduced in two ways:<br>
1.	In the form of a carboxyiic acid using the protocol described above (for example acetic acid) or,<br>
2.	As an acylating agent such as an anhydride or an acid chloride. The following example illustrates the capping with succinic anhydride: After the Fmoc deprotection and subsequent washing protocol, DMF was added (350 uL), followed by 400 uL each of a DMF solution of succinic anhydride (0.5 M, 0.2 mmol) and DIPEA (1.0 M, 0.4 mmol). The resins were stirred for 2 h and a recoupling step was performed. At the end of the synthesis the resin was washed with 1.5 mL portions of DCM (3x), MeOH (3x), DCM (3x), and were dried under vacuum for 2 h. The cleavage from the resin and concomitant side chain deprotection was effected by the addition of 1.5 mL of a mixture of TFA, H20, DTT and TIS (92.5: 2.5:2.5: 2.5). After shaking for 2.5 h, the resin was filtered and washed with 1.5 mL of DCM. The filtrates were combined and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation. Each compound was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC using a C18 column (22 mm by 500 mm). The product-containing fractions were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, combined and lyophilized.<br>

The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. The CH3CN is evaporated in vacuo. The residue diluted with ethyl acetate is washed twice with a saturated solution of NaHC03, once with brine and dried with MgS04.

EXAMPLE 36<br>
Cloning, expression and purification of the recombinant HCV NS3 protease type 1b.<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
Serum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained through an external collaboration (Bernard Willems MD, Hopital St-Luc, Montreal, Canada and Dr. Donald Murphy, Laboratoire de Sante Publique du Quebec, Ste-Anne de Bellevue, Canada). An engineered full-length cDNA template of the HCV genome was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA and using specific primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype 1 b strains. From the determination of the entire genomic sequence, a genotype 1b was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol., (1993), 31, p.1493-1503). The amino acid sequence of the non¬structural region, NS2-NS4B, was shown to be greater than 93% identical to HCV genotype 1b (BK, JK and 483 isolates) and 88% identical to HCV genotype 1a (HCV-1 isolate). A DNA fragment encoding the polyprotein precursor (NS3/NS4A/NS4B/NS5A/NS5B) was generated by PCR and introduced into eukaryotic expression vectors. After transient transfection, the polyprotein processing mediated by the HCV NS3 protease was demonstrated by the presence of the mature NS3 protein using Western blot analysis. The mature NS3 protein was not observed with expression of a polyprotein precursor containing the mutation S1165A, which inactivates the NS3 protease, confirming the functionality of the HCV NS3 protease.<br>
The DNA fragment encoding the recombinant HCV NS3 protease (amino acid 1027 to 1206) was cloned in the pET11d bacterial expression vector. The NS3 protease expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS was induced by incubation with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 22°C. A typical fermentation (18 L) yielded approximately 100 g of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (3.0 mL/g) consisting of 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40 and stored at -80°C. Cells were thawed and homogenized following the addition of 5 mM DTT. Magnesium chloride and DNase were then added to the homogenate at final concentrations of 20 mM and 20 u.g/mL respectively. After a 25 min incubation at 4° C, the homogenate was sonicated and centrifuged at 15000 x c/for 30 min at 4°C. The pH of the supernatant was then adjusted to 6.5 using a 1M sodium phosphate solution.<br>
An additional gel filtration chromatography step was added to the 2 step purification procedure described in WO 95/22985 (incorporated herein by reference). Briefly,<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
the supernatant from the bacterial extract was loaded on a SP HiTrap column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated at a flow rate of 2 mL/min in buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5,10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% NP-40). The column was then washed with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCI and the protease eluted by applying 10 column volumes of a linear 0.15 to 0.3 M NaCI gradient. NS3 protease-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to a final NaCI concentration of 0.1 M. The enzyme was further purified on a HiTrap Heparin column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 0.01 % NP-40). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The column was then washed with buffer B containing 0.15 M NaCI at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Two step washes were performed in the presence of buffer B containing 0.3 or 1M NaCI. The protease was recovered in the 0.3M NaCI wash, diluted 3-fold with buffer B, reapplied on the HiTrap Heparin column and eluted with buffer B containing 0.4 M NaCI. Finally, the NS3 protease-containing fractions were applied on a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.3 M NaCI. The purity of the HCV NS3 protease obtained from the pooled fractions was judged to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry analysis.<br>
The enzyme was stored at -80°C and was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.<br>
EXAMPLE 37<br>
Recombinant HCV NS3 protease/NS4A cofactor peptide radiometric assay.<br>
The enzyme was cloned, expressed and prepared according to the protocol described in Example 36. The enzyme was stored at -80°C, thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use in the assay buffer containing the NS4A cofactor peptide.<br>
The substrate used for the NS3 protease/ NS4A cofactor peptide radiometric assay, DDIVPC-SMSYTW, is cleaved between the cysteine and the serine residues by the enzyme. The sequence DDIVPC-SMSYTW corresponds to the NS5A/NS5B natural cleavage site in which the cysteine residue in P2 has been substituted for a proline. The peptide substrate DDIVPC-SMSYTW and the tracer biotin-DDIVPC-SMS[125I-Y]TW are incubated with the recombinant NS3 protease and the NS4A peptide cofactor KKGSVVIVGRIILSGRK (molar ratio enzyme: cofactor 1:100) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. The separation of substrate from products is performed by adding avidin-coated agarose beads to the assay mixture followed by filtration. The amount of SMS[125I-Y]TW product found in the filtrate allows for the calculation of the<br><br><br>
percentage of substrate conversion and of the percentage of inhibition.<br>
A.	Reagents<br>

PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
in a Miliipore MADP N65 filtration plate. The quenched assay mixture was transferred to the filtration plate, and incubated for 60 min at 23°C under gentle agitation.<br>
The plates were filtered using a Miliipore Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold Filtration apparatus, and 40 u,L of the filtrate was transferred in an opaque 96-well plate containing 60 \iL of scintillation fluid per well.<br>
The filtrates were counted on a Packard TopCount instrument using a 125l-liquid protocol for 1 minute.<br>
The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br><br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, N.C.).<br>
EXAMPLE 38<br>
Full-length NS3-NS4A heterodimer protein assay<br>
The NS2-NS5B-3" non coding region was cloned by RT-PCR into the pCR®3 vector (Invitrogen) using RNA extracted from the serum of an HCV genotype 1b infected individual (provided by Dr. Bernard Willems, Hdpital St-Luc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The NS3-NS4A DNA region was then subcloned by PCR into the pFastBac™ HTa baculovirus expression vector (Gibco/BRL). The vector sequence includes a region encoding a 28-residue N-terrninal sequence which contains a hexahistidine tag. The Bac-to-Bac™ baculovirus expression system (Gibco/BRL) was used to produce the recombinant baculovirus. The full length mature NS3 and NS4A heterodimer protein (His-NS3-NS4AFL) was expressed by infecting 106 Sf21 cells/mL with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1-0.2 at 27°C. The infected culture was harvested 48 to 64 h later by centrifugation at 4°C. The cell pellet was homogenized in 50mM NaP04, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol (w/v), 2mM 3-mercaptoethanol, in presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. His-NS3-NS4AFL was then extracted from the cell lysate with 1.5% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5M NaCl, and a DNase treatment. After ultracentrifugation, the soluble extract was diluted 4-fold and bound on a Pharmacia Hi-Trap Ni-chelating column. The His-<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
NS3-NS4AFL was eluted in a &gt;90% pure form (as judged by SDS-PAGE), using a 50 to 400 mM imidazole gradient. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was stored at -80°C in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 M NaCI, 0.25 M imidazole, 0.1% NP-40. It was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.<br>
The protease activity of His-NS3-NS4AFL was assayed in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 0.25 M sodium citrate, 0.01% (w/v) n-dodecyl-f3-D-maltoside, 1 mM TCEP. Five (5) uM of the internally quenched substrate anthranilyl-DDIVPAbu[C(0)-0]-AMY(3-NO2)TW-OH in presence of various concentrations of inhibitor were incubated with 1.5 nM of His-NS3-NS4AFL for 45 min at 23°C. The final DMSO concentration did not exceed 5.25%. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 1M MES, pH 5.8. Fluorescence of the N-terminal product was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader (excitation wavelength; 325 nm; emission wavelength: 423 nm).<br>
The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br><br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, N.C.).<br>
EXAMPLE 39<br>
NS3 Protease Cell-based assay<br>
This assay was done with Huh-7 cells, a human cell line derived from a hepatoma, co-transfected with 2 DNA constructs:<br>
-	one expressing a polyprotein comprising the HCV non-structural proteins fused to tTA in the following order: NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-tTA (called NS3);<br>
-	the other expressing the reporter protein, secreted alkaline phosphatase, under the control of tTA (called SEAP).<br>
The polyprotein must be cleaved by the NS3 protease for the mature proteins to be released. Upon release of the mature proteins, it is believed that the viral proteins will form a complex at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum while tTA will migrate to the nucleus and transactivate the SEAP gene. Therefore, reduction of NS3 proteolytic activity should lead to reduction of mature tTA levels and<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
concomitant decrease in SEAP activity.<br>
To control for other effects of the compounds, a parallel transfection was done where a construct expressing tTA alone (called tTA) was co-transfected with the SEAP construct such that SEAP activity is independent of NS3 proteolytic activity.<br>
Protocol of the assay: Huh-7 cells, grown in CHO-SFMII + 10% FCS (fetal calf serum), were co-transfected with either NS3 and SEAP or tTA and SEAP, using the FuGene protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). After 5 h at 37°, the cells were washed, trypsinized and plated (at 80 000 cells/well) in 96-well plates containing a range of concentrations of the compounds to be tested. After a 24-h incubation period, an aliquot of the medium was drawn and the SEAP activity in this aliquot was measured with the Phospha-Light kit (Tropix).<br>
Analysis of the percent inhibition of SEAP activity with respect to compound concentration was performed with the SAS software to obtain the EC50.<br>
The toxicity of the compound (TC50) was then assessed using the MTT assay as follows:<br>
20uL of a MTT solution (5mg/ml medium) was added per well and incubated at 37° for 4 hrs;<br>
the medium was removed and 50 yi of 0.01 N HCI + 10% Triton X-100 was added;<br>
after shaking at RT for at least 1 hr, the OD of each well was read at 595 nm wavelength.<br>
The TC50 was calculated in the same way as the EC50.<br>
EXAMPLE 40<br>
Specificity assays<br>
The specificity of the compounds was determined against a variety of serine proteases: human leukocyte elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase and bovine pancreatic a-chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases a 96-well plate format protocol using a colorimetric p-nitroaniline (pNA) substrate specific for each enzyme was used. Each assay included a 1 h enzyme-inhibitor preincubation at 30°C followed by addition of substrate and hydrolysis to ==30% conversion as measured on a UV Thermomax® microplate reader. Substrate concentrations were kept as low as possible compared to KM to reduce substrate<br><br>

A representative example is summarized below for porcine pancreatic elastase:<br>

After 60 min pre-incubation at 30°C, 20uL of substrate solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,0.5 M Na2S04,50 mM NaCI, 0.1 mM EDTA, 665 uM Succ-AAA-pNA) were added to each well and the reaction was further incubated at 30°C for 60 min after which time the absorbance was read on the UV Thermomax® plate reader. Rows of wells were allocated for controls (no inhibitor) and for blanks (no inhibitor and no enzyme).<br>
The sequential 2-fold dilutions of the inhibitor solution were performed on a separate plate by the liquid handler using 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCI, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Tween-20,15% DMSO. All other specificity assays were performed in a similar fashion.<br>

WO 00/09543<br><br>

HEPATITIS C INHIBITOR TRI-PEPTIDES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, process for their synthesis, compositions and methods for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV1 infection. In particular, the present invention provides novel peptide analogs, pharmaceutical compositions containing such analogs and methods for using these analogs in the treatment of HCV infection. The present invention also provides processes and intermediates for the synthesis of these peptide analogs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of post-transfusion and community-acquired non-A non-B hepatitis worldwide. It is estimated that over 150 million people worldwide are infected by the virus. A high percentage of carriers become chronically infected and many progress to chronic liver disease, so-called chronic hepatitis C. This group is in turn at high risk for serious liver disease such as iiver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and terminal liver disease leading to death.<br>
The mechanism by which HCV establishes viral persistence and causes a high rate of chronic liver disease has not been thoroughly elucidated. It is not known how HCV interacts with and evades the host immune system. In addition, the roles of cellular and humoral immune responses in protection against HCV infection and disease have yet to be established. Immunoglobulins have been reported for prophylaxis of transfusion-associated viral hepatitis, however, the Center for Disease Control does not presently recommend immunoglobulins treatment for this purpose. The lack of an effective protective immune response is hampering the development of a vaccine or adequate post-exposure prophylaxis measures, so in the near-term, hopes are firmly pinned on antiviral interventions.<br>
Various clinical studies have been conducted with the goal of identifying pharmaceutical agents capable of effectively treating HCV infection in patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis C. These studies have involved the use of interferon-alpha, alone and in combination with other antiviral agents. Such studies have shown that a substantial number of the participants do not respond to these therapies, and of those that do respond favorably, a large proportion were found to relapse after termination of treatment.<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
Until recently, interferon (IFN) was the only available therapy of proven benefit approved in the clinic for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However the sustained response rate is low, and interferon treatment also induces severe side-effects (i.e. retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, depression) that diminish the quality of life of treated patients. Recently, interferon in combination with ribavirin has been approved for patients non-responsive to IFN alone. However, the side effects caused by IFN are not alleviated with this combination therapy.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection that overcomes the limitations of existing pharmaceutical therapies.<br>
HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (henceforth referred to as NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral repl"tcase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally encoded enzymes that are essential for the replication of the virus. In this vein, patent application WO 97/06804 describes the (-) enantiomer of the nucleoside analogue cytosine-1,3-oxathiolane (also known as 3TC) as active against HCV. This compound, although reported as safe in previous clinical trials against HIV and HBV, has yet to be clinically proven active against HCV and its mechanism of action<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
against the virus has yet to be reported.<br>
Intense efforts to discover compounds which inhibit the NS3 protease or RNA helicase of HCV have led to the following disclosures:<br>
•	US patent 5,633,388 describes heterocyclic-substituted carboxamides and analogues as being active against HCV. These compounds are directed against the helicase activity of the NS3 protein of the virus but clinical tests have not yet been reported.<br>
•	A phenanthrenequinone has been reported by Chu et al., (Tel. Lett., (1996), 7229-7232) to have activity against the HCV NS3 protease in vitro. No further development on this compound has been reported.<br>
•	A paper presented at the Ninth International Conference on Antiviral Research, Urabandai, Fukyshima, Japan (1996) (Antiviral Research, (1996), 30,1, A23 (abstract 19)) reports thiazolidine derivatives to be inhibitory to the HCV protease.<br>
Several studies have reported compounds inhibitory to other serine proteases, such as human leukocyte elastase. One family of these compounds is reported in WO 95/33764 (Hoechst Marion Roussel, 1995). The peptides disclosed in this application are morpholinylcarbonyl-benzoyl-peptide analogues that are structurally different from the peptides of the present invention.<br>
•	WO 98/17679 from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. discloses inhibitors of serine protease, particularly, Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease. These inhibitors are peptide analogues based on the NS5A/5B natural substrate. Although several tripeptides are disclosed, all of these peptide analogues contain C-terminal activated carbonyl function as an essential feature. These analogues were also reported to be active against other serine protease and are therefore not specific for HCV NS3 protease.<br>
•	Hoffman LaRoche has also reported hexapeptides that are proteinase inhibitors useful as antiviral agents for the treatment of HCV infection. These peptides contain an aldehyde or a boronic acid at the C-terminus.<br>
•	Steinkuhler et al. and Ingallinella et al. have published on NS4A-4B product inhibition (Biochemistry (1998), 37, 8899-8905 and 8906-8914). However, the peptides and peptide analogues presented do not include nor do they lead to the<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
design of the peptides of the present invention.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that it provides tripeptides that are inhibitory to the NS3 protease of the hepatitis C virus.<br>
A further advantage of one aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that these peptides specifically inhibit the NS3 protease and do not show significant inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 300 uM against other serine proteases such as human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), or bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin, or cysteine proteases such as human liver cathepsin B (Cat B).<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that it provides small peptides of low molecular weight that may be capable of penetrating cell membranes and may be active in cell culture and in vivo with good pharmacokinetic profile.<br>

Preferably, R1 is H, C1-3 alkyl, C3.5 cycloalkyl, or C2-4 alkenyl optionally substituted with halo. More preferably R1 is ethyl, vinyl, cyclopropyl, 1 or 2-bromoethyl or 1 or 2-bromovinyl. Most preferably, R1 is vinyl.<br>
When R1 is not H, then P1 is preferably a cyclopropyl system of formula:<br><br>
i     wherein C1 and C2 each represent an asymmetric carbon atom at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclopropyl ring. Notwithstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds of formula I, the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds of formula I can exist as racemic mixtures of diastereoisomers. As illustrated in the examples hereinafter, the racemic mixtures<br>
i     can be prepared and thereafter separated into individual optical isomers, or these optical isomers can be prepared by chiral synthesis.<br>
Hence, the compound of formula I can exist as a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers at carbon 1 but wherein R1, at carbon 2 is orientated syn to the<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
carbonyl at position 1, represented by the radical:<br><br>
or the compound of formula I can exist as a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers wherein R1 at position 2 is orientated anti to the carbonyl at position 1, represented by the radical:<br><br>
In turn, the racemic mixtures can be separated into individual optical isomers.<br>
A most interesting finding of this invention pertains to the addition of a R1, substituent on the carbon 2 as well as the spatial orientation of the P1 segment. The finding concerns the configuration of the asymmetric carbon 1. A preferred embodiment is one wherein R1, is not H and carbon 1 has the R configuration.<br><br>
More explicitly, the introduction of a substituent (R1 at C2 has an impact on the potency when R1 is introduced in a way that C1 has the R configuration. For example compounds 901 {1R,2S} and 203 (1R,2R) have activities of 25 and 82 nM respectively. When compared to the unsubstituted cyclopropyl compound 111 (475 nM), a substantial increase in potency is observed. Moreover, as shown for<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
compounds 901 and 203 when carbon 1 has the R configuration, HCV NS3 protease inhibition is further enhanced by the configuration of the substituent R1 (e.g. alkyl or alkylene) at carbon 2 of the cyclopropyl ring, e.g. the compound that possesses R1 "syn" to the carboxyl has greater potency (25 nM) than the "antf enantiomer (82 nM). We can see the effect of the R vs. S configuration at C1 by comparing compounds 801 (1R.2S) and its corresponding (1S.2S) isomer which have potencies of 6 nM and &gt;10 uM respectively, a difference of over 1500 fold!!<br>
Therefore a most preferred compound is an optical isomer having the R1, substituent and the carbonyl in a syn orientation in the following absolute configuration:<br><br>
In the case where R, is ethyl, for example, the asymmetric carbon atoms at positions 1 and 2 have the R,R configuration.<br>

PROCESS<br>
The compounds of the present invention were synthesized according to a general process as illustrated in scheme I (wherein CPG is a carboxyl protecting group and APG is an amino protecting group):<br><br>
Briefly, the P1, P2, and P3 can be linked by well known peptide coupling techniques. The P1, P2, and P3 groups may be linked together in any order as long as the final<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
compound corresponds to peptides of Formula I. For example, P3 can be linked to P2-P1 ; or P1 linked to P3-P2.<br>
Generally, peptides are elongated by deprotecting the ct-amino group of the N-terminal residue and coupling the unprotected carboxyl group of the next suitably N-protected amino acid through a peptide linkage using the methods described. This deprotection and coupling procedure is repeated until the desired sequence is obtained. This coupling can be performed with the constituent amino acids in stepwise fashion, as depicted in Scheme I, or by solid phase peptide synthesis according to the method originally described in Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1963), 85, 2149-2154, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Coupling between two amino acids, an amino acid and a peptide, or two peptide fragments can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide) method, active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, Woodward reagent K-method, carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide method) can be enhanced by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.<br>
More explicitly, the coupling step involves the dehydrative coupling of a free carboxyl of one reactant with the free amino group of the other reactant in the presence of a coupling agent to form a linking amide bond. Descriptions of such coupling agents are found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry", 2nd reved., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993). Examples of suitable coupling agents are /V,/V"-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of /V,/V-dicyclohexy!carbodiimide or /V-ethyl-/V"-[(3-dimethyiamino)propyl]carbodiimide. A practical and useful coupling agent is the commercially available (benzotriazol-1 -yloxy)tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 2-(1H-benzotriazo-1-yl)-/V, N, N; /V"-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate. Still another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-/V,/V,/V,/V-tetrarnethy!uronium hexafluorophosphate.<br><br>
WO OU/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
The coupling reaction is conducted in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. An excess of a tertiary amine, e.g. diisopropylethylamine, /V-methylmorpholine or A/-methylpyrrolidine, is added to maintain the reaction mixture at a pH of about 8. The reaction temperature usually ranges between 0°C and 50°C and the reaction time usually ranges between 15 min and 24 h.<br>
When a solid phase synthetic approach is employed, the C-terminal carboxylic acid is attached to an insoluble carrier (usually polystyrene). These insoluble carriers contain a group that will react with the carboxylic group to form a bond that is stable to the elongation conditions but readily cleaved later. Examples of which are: chloro-or bromomethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, trytil resin and 2-methoxy-4-alkoxy-benzylaloconol resin.<br>
Many of these resins are commercially available with the desired C-terminal amino acid already incorporated. Alternatively, the amino acid can be incorporated on the solid support by known methods (Wang, S.-S., J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1973), 95,1328; Atherton, E.; Shepard, R.C. "Solid-phase peptide synthesis; a practical approach" IRL Press: Oxford, (1989); 131-148). In addition to the foregoing, other methods of peptide synthesis are described in Stewart and Young, "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", 2nd ed., Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL (1984); Gross, Meienhofer, Udenfriend, Eds., The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9, Academic Press, New-York, (1980-1987); Bodansky et a!., The Practice of Peptide Synthesis" Springer-Verlag, New-York (1984), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The functional groups of the constituent amino acids generally must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid formation of undesired bonds. The protecting groups that can be used are listed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The a-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected as an ester (CPG) that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include: 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilylethyl and f-butyl, 2) aralkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, or 3) esters that can be cleaved by<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
mild base treatment or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.<br>
The a-amino group of each amino acid to be coupled to the growing peptide chain must be protected (APG). Any protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of such groups include: 1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or 2) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as terf-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alky] carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl; and 7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. The preferred a-amino protecting group is either Boc or Fmoc. Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available.<br>
The a-amino protecting group of the newly added amino acid residue is cleaved prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethahe, or HCI in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0°C and room temperature (RT) usually 20 -22°C.<br>
Any of the amino acids having side chain functionalities must be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above-described groups. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate protecting groups for these side chain functionalities depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide. The selection of such protecting groups is important in that the group must not be removed during the deprotection and coupling of the a-amino group.<br>
For example, when Boc is used as the a-amino protecting group, the following side<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
chain protecting group are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect the amino side chain of amino acids such as Lys and Arg; acetamidomethyl, benzyl (Bn), or t-butylsuifonyl moieties can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect the hydroxy containing side chains of serine, threonine or hydroxyproline; and benzyl esters can be used to protect the carboxy containing side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.<br>
When Fmoc is chosen for the a-amine protection, usually tert-butyl  based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for lysine and arginine, tert-butyl ether for serine, threonine and hydroxyproline, and fert-butyl ester for aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Triphenylmethyl (Trityl) moiety can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine.<br>
Once the elongation of the peptide is completed all of the protecting groups are removed. When a liquid phase synthesis is used, the protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups. These procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
When a solid phase synthesis is used, the peptide is cleaved from the resin simultaneously with the removal of the protecting groups. When the Boc protection method is used in the synthesis, treatment with anhydrous HF containing additives such as dimethyl sulfide, anisole, thioanisole, or p-cresol at 0°C is the preferred method for cleaving the peptide from the resin. The cleavage of the peptide can also be accomplished by other acid reagents such as trifiuoromethanesulfonic acid/trifluoroacetic acid mixtures. If the Fmoc protection method is used, the N-terminal Fmoc group is cleaved with reagents described earlier. The other protecting groups and the peptide are cleaved from the resin using solution of trifluoroacetic acid and various additives such as anisole, etc.<br>

Cloning, expression and purification of the recombinant HCV NS3 protease type 1b.<br><br>
WO 00/09543	PCT/CA99/00736<br>
Serum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained through an external collaboration (Bernard Willems MD, Hopital St-Luc, Montreal, Canada and Dr. Donald Murphy, Laboratoire de Sante Publique du Quebec, Ste-Anne de Bellevue, Canada). An engineered full-length cDNA template of the HCV genome was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA and using specific primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype 1 b strains. From the determination of the entire genomic sequence, a genotype 1b was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol., (1993), 31, p.1493-1503). The amino acid sequence of the non¬structural region, NS2-NS4B, was shown to be greater than 93% identical to HCV genotype 1b (BK, JK and 483 isolates) and 88% identical to HCV genotype 1a (HCV-1 isolate). A DNA fragment encoding the polyprotein precursor (NS3/NS4A/NS4B/NS5A/NS5B) was generated by PCR and introduced into eukaryotic expression vectors. After transient transfection, the polyprotein processing mediated by the HCV NS3 protease was demonstrated by the presence of the mature NS3 protein using Western blot analysis. The mature NS3 protein was not observed with expression of a polyprotein precursor containing the mutation S1165A, which inactivates the NS3 protease, confirming the functionality of the HCV NS3 protease.<br>
The DNA fragment encoding the recombinant HCV NS3 protease (amino acid 1027 to 1206) was cloned in the pET11d bacterial expression vector. The NS3 protease expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS was induced by incubation with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 22°C. A typical fermentation (18 L) yielded approximately 100 g of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (3.0 mL/g) consisting of 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40 and stored at -80°C. Cells were thawed and homogenized following the addition of 5 mM DTT. Magnesium chloride and DNase were then added to the homogenate at final concentrations of 20 mM and 20 u.g/mL respectively. After a 25 min incubation at 4° C, the homogenate was sonicated and centrifuged at 15000 x c/for 30 min at 4°C. The pH of the supernatant was then adjusted to 6.5 using a 1M sodium phosphate solution.<br>
An additional gel filtration chromatography step was added to the 2 step purification procedure described in WO 95/22985 (incorporated herein by reference). Briefly,<br><br>

PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
the supernatant from the bacterial extract was loaded on a SP HiTrap column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated at a flow rate of 2 mL/min in buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5,10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% NP-40). The column was then washed with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCI and the protease eluted by applying 10 column volumes of a linear 0.15 to 0.3 M NaCI gradient. NS3 protease-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to a final NaCI concentration of 0.1 M. The enzyme was further purified on a HiTrap Heparin column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 0.01 % NP-40). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The column was then washed with buffer B containing 0.15 M NaCI at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Two step washes were performed in the presence of buffer B containing 0.3 or 1M NaCI. The protease was recovered in the 0.3M NaCI wash, diluted 3-fold with buffer B, reapplied on the HiTrap Heparin column and eluted with buffer B containing 0.4 M NaCI. Finally, the NS3 protease-containing fractions were applied on a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.3 M NaCI. The purity of the HCV NS3 protease obtained from the pooled fractions was judged to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry analysis.<br>
The enzyme was stored at -80°C and was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.<br>
EXAMPLE 37<br>
Recombinant HCV NS3 protease/NS4A cofactor peptide radiometric assay.<br>
The enzyme was cloned, expressed and prepared according to the protocol described in Example 36. The enzyme was stored at -80°C, thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use in the assay buffer containing the NS4A cofactor peptide.<br>
The substrate used for the NS3 protease/ NS4A cofactor peptide radiometric assay, DDIVPC-SMSYTW, is cleaved between the cysteine and the serine residues by the enzyme. The sequence DDIVPC-SMSYTW corresponds to the NS5A/NS5B natural cleavage site in which the cysteine residue in P2 has been substituted for a proline. The peptide substrate DDIVPC-SMSYTW and the tracer biotin-DDIVPC-SMS[125I-Y]TW are incubated with the recombinant NS3 protease and the NS4A peptide cofactor KKGSVVIVGRIILSGRK (molar ratio enzyme: cofactor 1:100) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. The separation of substrate from products is performed by adding avidin-coated agarose beads to the assay mixture followed by filtration. The amount of SMS[125I-Y]TW product found in the filtrate allows for the calculation of the<br><br><br>
percentage of substrate conversion and of the percentage of inhibition.<br>

in a Miliipore MADP N65 filtration plate. The quenched assay mixture was transferred to the filtration plate, and incubated for 60 min at 23°C under gentle agitation.<br>
The plates were filtered using a Miliipore Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold Filtration apparatus, and 40 u,L of the filtrate was transferred in an opaque 96-well plate containing 60 \iL of scintillation fluid per well.<br>
The filtrates were counted on a Packard TopCount instrument using a 125l-liquid protocol for 1 minute.<br>
The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br><br>

EXAMPLE 38<br>
Full-length NS3-NS4A heterodimer protein assay<br>
The NS2-NS5B-3" non coding region was cloned by RT-PCR into the pCR®3 vector (Invitrogen) using RNA extracted from the serum of an HCV genotype 1b infected individual (provided by Dr. Bernard Willems, Hdpital St-Luc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The NS3-NS4A DNA region was then subcloned by PCR into the pFastBac™ HTa baculovirus expression vector (Gibco/BRL). The vector sequence includes a region encoding a 28-residue N-terrninal sequence which contains a hexahistidine tag. The Bac-to-Bac™ baculovirus expression system (Gibco/BRL) was used to produce the recombinant baculovirus. The full length mature NS3 and NS4A heterodimer protein (His-NS3-NS4AFL) was expressed by infecting 106 Sf21 cells/mL with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1-0.2 at 27°C. The infected culture was harvested 48 to 64 h later by centrifugation at 4°C. The cell pellet was homogenized in 50mM NaP04, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol (w/v), 2mM 3-mercaptoethanol, in presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. His-NS3-NS4AFL was then extracted from the cell lysate with 1.5% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5M NaCl, and a DNase treatment. After ultracentrifugation, the soluble extract was diluted 4-fold and bound on a Pharmacia Hi-Trap Ni-chelating column. The His-<br><br>

PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
NS3-NS4AFL was eluted in a &gt;90% pure form (as judged by SDS-PAGE), using a 50 to 400 mM imidazole gradient. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was stored at -80°C in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 M NaCI, 0.25 M imidazole, 0.1% NP-40. It was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.<br>
The protease activity of His-NS3-NS4AFL was assayed in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 0.25 M sodium citrate, 0.01% (w/v) n-dodecyl-f3-D-maltoside, 1 mM TCEP. Five (5) uM of the internally quenched substrate anthranilyl-DDIVPAbu[C(0)-0]-AMY(3-NO2)TW-OH in presence of various concentrations of inhibitor were incubated with 1.5 nM of His-NS3-NS4AFL for 45 min at 23°C. The final DMSO concentration did not exceed 5.25%. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 1M MES, pH 5.8. Fluorescence of the N-terminal product was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader (excitation wavelength; 325 nm; emission wavelength: 423 nm).<br>
The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br><br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, N.C.).<br>
EXAMPLE 39<br>
NS3 Protease Cell-based assay<br>
This assay was done with Huh-7 cells, a human cell line derived from a hepatoma, co-transfected with 2 DNA constructs:<br>
-	one expressing a polyprotein comprising the HCV non-structural proteins fused to tTA in the following order: NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-tTA (called NS3);<br>
-	the other expressing the reporter protein, secreted alkaline phosphatase, under the control of tTA (called SEAP).<br>
The polyprotein must be cleaved by the NS3 protease for the mature proteins to be released. Upon release of the mature proteins, it is believed that the viral proteins will form a complex at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum while tTA will migrate to the nucleus and transactivate the SEAP gene. Therefore, reduction of NS3 proteolytic activity should lead to reduction of mature tTA levels and<br><br>
WO 00/09543<br><br>
PCT/CA99/00736<br><br>
concomitant decrease in SEAP activity.<br>
To control for other effects of the compounds, a parallel transfection was done where a construct expressing tTA alone (called tTA) was co-transfected with the SEAP construct such that SEAP activity is independent of NS3 proteolytic activity.<br>
Protocol of the assay: Huh-7 cells, grown in CHO-SFMII + 10% FCS (fetal calf serum), were co-transfected with either NS3 and SEAP or tTA and SEAP, using the FuGene protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). After 5 h at 37°, the cells were washed, trypsinized and plated (at 80 000 cells/well) in 96-well plates containing a range of concentrations of the compounds to be tested. After a 24-h incubation period, an aliquot of the medium was drawn and the SEAP activity in this aliquot was measured with the Phospha-Light kit (Tropix).<br>
Analysis of the percent inhibition of SEAP activity with respect to compound concentration was performed with the SAS software to obtain the EC50.<br>
The toxicity of the compound (TC50) was then assessed using the MTT assay as follows:<br>
20uL of a MTT solution (5mg/ml medium) was added per well and incubated at 37° for 4 hrs;<br>
the medium was removed and 50 yi of 0.01 N HCI + 10% Triton X-100 was added;<br>
after shaking at RT for at least 1 hr, the OD of each well was read at 595 nm wavelength.<br>
The TC50 was calculated in the same way as the EC50.<br>
EXAMPLE 40<br>
Specificity assays<br>
The specificity of the compounds was determined against a variety of serine proteases: human leukocyte elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase and bovine pancreatic a-chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases a 96-well plate format protocol using a colorimetric p-nitroaniline (pNA) substrate specific for each enzyme was used. Each assay included a 1 h enzyme-inhibitor preincubation at 30°C followed by addition of substrate and hydrolysis to ==30% conversion as measured on a UV Thermomax® microplate reader. Substrate concentrations were kept as low as possible compared to KM to reduce substrate<br><br>

A representative example is summarized below for porcine pancreatic elastase:<br>
In a polystyrene flat-bottom 96-well plate were added using a Biomek liquid handler (Beckman):<br>

After 60 min pre-incubation at 30°C, 20uL of substrate solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,0.5 M Na2S04,50 mM NaCI, 0.1 mM EDTA, 665 uM Succ-AAA-pNA) were added to each well and the reaction was further incubated at 30°C for 60 min after which time the absorbance was read on the UV Thermomax® plate reader. Rows of wells were allocated for controls (no inhibitor) and for blanks (no inhibitor and no enzyme).<br>
The sequential 2-fold dilutions of the inhibitor solution were performed on a separate plate by the liquid handler using 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCI, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Tween-20,15% DMSO. All other specificity assays were performed in a similar fashion.<br>
