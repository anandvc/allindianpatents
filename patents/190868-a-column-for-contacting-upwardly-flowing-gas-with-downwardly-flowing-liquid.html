The  present  invention  relates  to  a  column  for  contacting upwardly  flowing  gas  with  downwardly  flowing  liquid  in  order  to transfer  mass,   heat  and  momentum  between  the  phases.   Such  columns for  contacting  gas  and  liquid  are  well  known,   and  they  are  used  in for  example  distillation,   rectification,   absorption  and  stripping.<br>
In  the  specification  no  distinction  is  made  between  gas  and vapour;   the  word   *gas'   also  refers  to  vapour.<br>
A  column  for  contacting  upwardly  flowing  gas  with  downwardly flowing  liquid  is  normally  provided  with  an  inlet  for  gas  arranged in  the  lower  part  of  the  column,   an  inlet  for  liquid  arranged  in  the upper  part  of  the  column,   an  outlet  for  liquid  arranged  in  the  lower end  part  of  the  column  and  an  outlet  for  gas  arranged  in  the  upper end  part  of  the  column.   In  general  there  will  only  be  one  outlet  for gas  which  is  located  at  the  upper  end  of  the  column;   however,   the column  can  be  provided  with  more  inlets   for  liquid  and  gas  and  with more  outlets  for  liquid,   the  number  of  these  inlets  and  outlets  and their  locations  depend  on  the  application.<br>
In  the  column  there  is  arranged  at  least  one  horizontal  tray upon  which,   during  normal  operation,   liquid  and  gas  are  brought  into contact  with  each  other.  An  example  of  such  a  horizontal  tray  is  a perforated  plate  provided  with  a  downcomer.<br>
During  normal  operation  of  a  column  provided  with  a  perforated plate  having  a  downcomer,   liquid  is  continuously  supplied  onto  the perforated  plate  and  it  is  collected  in  a  layer  of  liquid  on  the perforated  plate.   Gas  passing  through  the  holes  in  the  perforated plate  is  contacted  with  the  liquid  on  the  perforated  plate.   Excess liquid  is  withdrawn  from  the  perforated  plate  through  the  downcomer, and  is  delivered  onto  the  next  lower  perforated  plate  where contacting  continues.   It  will  be  understood  that  when  the  perforated plate  is  the  lowermost  perforated  plate,   liquid  flows  to  the  lower end  part  of  the  column  from which  it  is  withdrawn   <br><br>
for  liquid.   Gas  emerging  from  the  liquid  layer  flows  upwardly  to  the next  higher  perforated  plate  where  contacting  continues.   It  will  be understood  that  when  the  perforated  plate  is  the  uppermost perforated  plate,   gas  flows  to  the  upper  end  part  of  the  column  from which  it  is  withdrawn  through  the  outlet  for  gas.<br>
The  present  invention  relates  in  particular  to  a  column  for contacting  gas  and  liquid,  wherein  the  horizontal  tray  comprises  a plate  provided  with  a  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device.   The  tubular gas/liquid  contact  device  comprises  a  contact  section  located  below the  plate,   a  separation  section  above  the  contact  section,   and  an outlet  section  above  the  separation  section  and  located  above  the plate,   wherein  the  contact  section  is  closed  at  its  bottom,   wherein the  wall  of  the  contact  section  is  provided  with  a  plurality  of tangential  gas  inlets,  wherein  a  liquid  delivery  tube  opens  into  the lower  end  of  the  contact  section,   and  wherein  the  outlet  section  has a  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with  coalescer  means.<br>
Such  a  device  is  disclosed  in  British  patent  specification No.   1  123  546.   In  the  known  device  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided with  coalescer  means  of  the  outlet  section  comprises  two  concentric layers  of  expanded  metal,   and  the  outlet  section  is  open  at  its upper  end.<br>
During  normal  operation  upwardly  flowing  gas  enters  through  the tangential  gas  inlets  into  contact  section  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid contact  device,   and  liquid  is  supplied  through  the  liquid  delivery tube  to  the  lower  part  of  the  contact  section.   Liquid  entering  into the  contact  section  is  dispersed  by  the  swirling  gas,   and  in dispersed  form  liquid  is  contacted  with  gas.  The  swirling  fluid enters  into  the  separation  section  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact device.   In  the  separation  section  liquid  moves  outwards  under  the influence  of  centrifugal  forces  and  it  is  collected  on  the  inner surface  of  the  wall  of  the  separation  section.   Gas  and  liquid  enter into  the  outlet  section,   and  gas  leaves  the  outlet  section  of  the tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  through  its  open  upper  end,   and liquid  coalesces  on  the  expanded  metal  from  where  it  trickles  on  the plate.<br><br>
As  the  upper  end  of  the  outlet  section  is  open,   a  large  amount of  liquid  can  be  entrained  with  the  gas  leaving  the  outlet  section through  its  upper  end.<br>
To  reduce  entrainment,   an  in roved  tubular  gas/liquid  contact device  was  proposed,   and  this  device  is  disclosed  in   ^Mathematical description  and  analysis  of  mass  transfer  mechanics  in  contact equipment  with  vortical  concurrent  stream  flow'   by  N  I  Savable  and N  A  Nikolaou,   Karol  Kazan  Chemical  Technology  Institute,   translated from  Teoreticheskie  Osnovy  Khimicheskoi  Tekhnologii,  Vol.   23,   No.   4, pages  435-444,   July-August,   1989.<br>
In  the  latter  gas/liquid  contact  device  the  gas  permeable  wall provided  with  coalescer  means  comprises  an  open-ended  tube  having  a cylindrical  wall  provided  with  tangential  outlets,   and  a  U-shaped annular  deflector  arranged  over  the  upper  end  of  the  open  ended tube,   which  annular  deflector  has  a  skirt  extending  over  the tangential  outlets  for  collecting  liquid.   So  that,   during  normal operation,   part  of  the  upwardly  flowing  gas  is  deflected  and  liquid entrained  in  the  gas  is  separated  from  the  gas.<br>
Supplicant  had  found  that  some  liquid  is  collected  on  the central  liquid  delivery  tube  and  that  this  liquid  is  subsequently blown  away  and  entrained  in  the  centre  of  the  mass  of  upwardly flowing  gas.   Since  this  gas  is  not  deflected  by  the  U-shaped  annular deflector,   some  liquid  still  leaves  the  open-ended  outlet  section with  the  gas.   Therefore  the  separation  of  gas  and  liquid  is  not complete.<br>
It  is  an  object  of  the  present  invention  to  reduce  the  amount of  liquid  entrained  with  the  gas  leaving  the  above-described  tubular gas/liquid  contact  device.<br>
To  this  end  the  column  for  contacting  upwardly  flowing  gas  with downwardly  flowing  liquid  according  to  the  present  invention  is characterized  in  that  the  top  of  the  outlet  section  is  provided  with a  cover.<br>
The  cover  closes  the  upper  end  of  the  outlet  section  and  thus the  cover  deflects  during  normal  operation  the  upwardly  passing<br><br>
fluid  so  that  the  fluid  flows  through  the  gas  permeable  wall provided  with  coalescer  means.<br>
The  liquid  delivery  tube  delivers  liquid  into  the  lower  part  of the  contact  section  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device.   The liquid  can  come  from  the  horizontal  tray  to  which  the  tubular gas/liquid  contact  device  pertains,   and  to  this  end  inlet  openings are  made  in  the  wall  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  above the  horizontal  tray,   and  the  liquid  delivery  tube  is  connected  by means  of  supply  conduits  to  the  openings.   The  liquid  may  as  well come  from  the  horizontal  tray  above  it,   and  to  this  end  the  liquid delivery  tube  is  a  downcomer  tube  extending  downwards  through  the tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device.<br>
Suitably  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with  coalescer  means of  the  outlet  section  comprises  a  tubular  layer  of  coalescer material,   wherein  the  inner  diameter  of  the  tubular  layer  is  equal to  or  larger  than  the  outer  diameter  of  the  separation  section.   The size  of  the  inner  diameter  of  the  tubular  layer  is   so  selected  that liquid  collected  in  the  tubular  layer  of  coalescer  material  can trickle  into  the  space  outside  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device and  onto  the  plate.   In  order  that  the  resistance  to  gas  flow  through the  tubular  layer  of  coalescer  material  is  not  too  high,   the  free area  of  the  tubular  layer  of  coalescer  material  is  larger  than  or equal  to  between  1  and  1.5  times  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device.<br>
Suitably  the  coalescer  material  includes  a  layer  of  expanded metal,   which  is  a  sheet  of  metal  that  is  slit  and  stretched  into  a lattice.  More  suitably  the  coalescer  material  comprises  at  least  two concentric  layers  of  expanded  metal.<br>
To  improve  the  separation  of  liquid  from  the  gas  flowing through  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with  coalescer  means  of  the outlet  section,   the  outlet  section  further  coir rises  two  or  more coalescer  strips  arranged  at  regular  intervals  along  the  outer surface  of  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with  coalescer  means.<br>
In  the  known  device,   the  contact  section  is  provided  with several  elongated  tangential  gas  inlets  which  are   <br>
regular  intervals  along  the  circumference  of  the  contact  section. Each  tangential  gas  inlet  comprises  an  elongated  strip  bend  to  the inside  of  the  contact  section,   the  height  of  the  strip  being substantially  equal  to  the  height  of  the  contact  section.   Upwardly flowing  gas  entering  into  the  contact  section  is  deflected,   and  the velocity  of  the  gas  in  the  contact  section  has  a  component  in  axial direction  and  a  component  in  circumferential  direction.   The magnitude  of  the  velocity  in  axial  direction  determines  the  time during  which  gas  and  liquid  are  in  contact  which  each  other,   and  it will  be  understood  that  the  contact  time  is  inverse  proportional  to the  magnitude  of  the  velocity  in  axial  direction.   To  reduce  the magnitude  of  the  velocity  in  axial  direction  the  elongated tangential  gas   inlets   are   replaced  by  a  plurality  of  tangential inlets   arranged  in  columns.   Each  tangential  gas   inlet  comprises  a tongue  which  is  bend  to  the  inside  of  the  contact  section,   wherein the  height  of  the  tongue  is  small  compared  to  the  height  of  the contact  section.   The  height  of  the  tongue  is  suitably  less   than  10 percent  of  the  length  of  the  contact  section.<br>
Suitably  the  contact  section  is  provided  with  two  or  more  of such  columns  of  tangential  gas   inlets,   wherein  the  columns   are arranged  at  regular  intervals  along  the  circumference  of  the  contact sexton.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a column for contacting upwardly £k&gt;wing gas with downwardly flowing liquid, the said column comprising a horizontal tray having a plate provided with a lobular gas/liquid contact device the and tubular gas/liquid contact device comprises a contact section located below the plate a separation section above the contact section and an outlet section above the separation section and located above tiie plate wherein tiie contact section is closed at its bottom, \^ieiein the wall of the contact section is provided with a plurality of tangential gas inlets wherein a liquid delivery tube in the form of a downoomer tube extending downwards through the tubular gasliquid contact device opens into the lower end of the contact section and wherein the outlet section comprises a gas pomeaUe wall provi^d with coalescer means characterized in that the top of the outlet secticm is [novided with a cover closing said top of the outlet section and deflecting the upwardly flowing gas with entrained liquid so that it flows through the coalescer means, and in that the gas permeable wall provided with coalescer means of the outlet section comprises a tubular layer of coalescer material, the inner diameter of the tubular layer being at least equal to the outer did&amp;ieter of the separation section.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with refo'ence to the accompanying drawing showing schematically a cross section of the column according to tiie invention.<br>

The  upper  horizontal  tray  3  comprises  a horizontal  plate  6  provided  with  two  vertical  tubular  gas/liquid contact  devices  8  extending  through  openings  in  the  plate  6,   and  the lower  horizontal  tray  5  con^rises  a  horizontal  plate  7  provided  with one  vertical  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  10  extending  through an  opening  in  the  plate  7.<br>
Each  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  devices  8  and  10 comprises  a  contact  section  12,   a  separation  section  13  which  is arranged  above  the  contact  section  12,   and  an  outlet  section  15 which  is  arranged  above  the  separation  section  13.   The  contact sections  12  of  the  tubular  gas/lic[uid  contact  devices  8  are  located below  the  plate  6  and  the  outlet  sections  15  are  located  above  the plate  6,   and  the  contact  section  12  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid contact  device  10  is  located  below  the  plate  7,   and  the  outlet section  15  is  located  above  the  plate  7.  The  contact  section  12,   the separation  section  13  and  the  outlet  section  15  are  in  fluid communication  with  each  other.<br>
The  wall  of  the  contact  section  12  is  provided  with  a  plurality of  tangential  gas  inlets  16  Each  tangential  gas  inlet  16  comprises  a tongue  which  is  bend  to  the  inside  of  the  contact  section  12,   the height  of  the  tongue  being  small  compared  to  the  height  of  the contact  section  12,   and  the  tangential  gas  inlets  16  are  arranged one  above  the  other  in  a  column  17.   For  the  sake  of  clarity  not  all tangential  gas  inlets  are  referred  to  with  a  reference  numeral,   and the  tongues  have  not  been  referred  to  with  a  reference  numeral.<br>
The  contact  section  12  is  closed  at  its  lower  end  by  means  of  a cover  18.  A  liquid  delivery  tube  19  opens  into  the  lower  end  of  the contact  section  12.   The  liquid  delivery  tubes   19  of  the  tubular gas/liquid  contact  devices  8  are  connected  to  supply  conduits  20, which  have  inlet  openings  21  opening  above  the  plate  6.  The  liquid delivery  tube  19  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  10  is  a downcomer  tube  23  which  extends  through  an  opening  in  the  plate  6 from  the  next  higher  tray  3  downwards  through  the  tubular  gas/liquid contact  device  10,   which  downcomer  23  has  an  inlet  opening  24  which is  located  above  inlet  openings  21.<br><br>
The  outlet  section  15  conprises  a  gas  permeable  wall  provided with  coalescer  means  25.   The  top  of  the  outlet  section  15  is provided  with  a  cover  27.<br>
The  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with  coalescer  means  25 comprise  a  tubular  layer  of  coalescer  means  in  the  form  of  two concentric  layers  of  expanded  metal  30,   the  inner  diameter  of  the tubular  layer  of  coalescer  means  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the outer  diameter  of  the  separation  section  13  so  that  the  tubular layer  fits  over  the  separation  section  13.  The  outlet  section  15 further  conprises  two  coalescer  strips  32  arranged  at  regular intervals  along  the  outer  surface  of  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided with  coalescer  means  25.<br>
During  normal  operation  liquid  is  continuously  supplied  to  the inlet   (not  shown)   for  liquid  arranged  in  the  upper  part  of  the column  1,   and  gas  is  continuously  supplied  to  the  inlet   (not  shown) for  gas  arranged  in  the  lower  part  of  the  column  1.   Liquid  supplied to  the  upper  end  of  coliomn  1  is  collected  on  plate  6  of  the  upper horizontal  tray  3.   Part  of  the  liquid  flows  through  inlet  openings 21  into  the  liquid  delivery  tubes  19,   another  part  of  the  liquid flows  through  inlet  opening  24  and  downcomer  tube  23  into  the  lower end  of  the  contact  section  12  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact device  10,   and  the  remainder  of  the  liquid  remains  on  the  plate  6. Upwardly  flowing  gas  enters  through  the  tangential  gas  inlets   16 into  the  contact  sections  12  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact devices  8.   Liquid  entering  into  the  contact  sections  12  is  dispersed by  the  swirling  gas,   and  in  dispersed  form  liquid  is  contacted  with gas.  The  swirling  fluid  enters  into  the  separation  sections  13  of the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  devices  8.   In  the  separation  sections 13  liquid  moves  outwards  under  the  influence  of  centrifugal  forces and  it  is  collected  on  the  inner  surfaces  of  the  walls  of  the separation  sections   13.   Gas  and  liquid  enter  into  the  outlet sections  15,   and  leave  the  outlet  sections  15  of  the  tubular gas/liquid  contact  devices   8  through  coalescer  means  in  the  form  of the  two  concentric  layers  of  expanded  metal  30.   Liquid  is   collected on  the  coalescer  means  and  trickles  downwards  on  the  plate  6,   and<br><br>
gas  flows  upwards.  The  outlet  sections  8  are  provided  with  coalescer strips  32  which  iit^rove  the  separation,   and  reduce  the  entrainment of  liquid  in  the  gas.   The  cover  27  deflects  the  upwardly  flowing fluid  so  that  it  flows  through  the  coalescer  means.<br>
In  case  there  is  a  further  horizontal  tray   (not  shown)   above the  upper  horizontal  tray  3,   gas  is  contacted  with  liquid  in  the contact  devices   (not  shown)   of  that  further  horizontal  tray,   and liquid  flows  after  contacting  through  a  downcomer   (not  shown)   onto plate  6.  And  in  case  the  upper  horizontal  tray  3  is  the  uppermost horizontal  tray,   gas  flows  to  the  upper  end  of  the  column  1  from which  it  is  withdrawn  through  the  outlet  for  gas   (not  shown);   and  in this  case  liquid  supplied  to  the  liquid  inlet  is  supplied  directly onto  the  plate  6.<br>
Liquid  flowing  through  the  downcomer  tube  23  is  passed  to  the lower  end  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  10  pertaining  to the  lower  horizontal  tray  5.   In  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device 10,   gas  and  liquid  are  brought  in  contact  with  each  other  in  the same  way  as  described  above  with  reference  to  the  tubular  gas/liquid contact  devices  8.   Liquid  leaving  the  outlet  section  15  of  the tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  10  is  collected  on  the  plate  7  of the  lower  horizontal  tray  5,   and  excess  liquid  is  removed  from  the lower  horizontal  tray  5  through  downcomer  tube  35  extending  through an  opening  the  plate  7.<br>
In  case  there  is  a  further  horizontal  tray   (not  shown)   below the  lower  horizontal  tray  5,   downcomer  tube  35  opens  into  tubular gas/liquid  contact  device   (not  shown)   of  that  further  horizontal tray;   and  in  case  the  lower  horizontal  tray  5  is  the  lowermost horizontal  tray,   liquid  is  discharged  into  the  lower  end  of  the column  1  from  which  it  is  withdrawn  through  the  outlet  for  liquid (not  shown).<br>
Some  experiments  have  been  carried  out  to  show  the  effect  of the  gas/liquid  contacting  device  of  the  present  invention.   In  the two  experiments   four  horizontal  trays  were  provided  with  gas/liquid contacting  devices,   water  was  used  as  the  liquid  and  air  was  used  as the  gas.   The  first  experiments  were  done  with  the  prior  art  device.<br><br>
wherein  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with  coalescer  means coitqprises  an  open-ended  tube  having  a  cylindrical  wall  provided  with tangential  outlets  in  the  form  of  vertical  slits  and  a  deflector  at the  top  in  the  form  of  an  annular  ring  mounted  on  the  upper  end  of the  outlet  section.   Each  tray  included  eleven  devices  having  an internal  diameter  of  50  mm.  At  a  gas  load  of  0.70  m/s  the  average entrainment  was  about  0.3.   This  results  can  be  coir^ared  with  the result  of  the  four  trays  each  provided  with  4  devices  according  to the  present  invention  each  having  an  internal  diameter  of  100  mm. For  the  same  liquid  flowrate,   the  entrainment  at  a  gas  load  of  0.70 m/s  was  0.03.<br>
In  the  above  results  the  entrainment  is  the  volume  of  liquid entrained  per  unit  of  time  divided  by  the  volume  of  liquid  supplied to  the  column  per  unit  time,   and  the  gas  load  factor  is  the  volume of  gas  supplied  to  the  contact  device  per  unit  time  divided  by  the area  of  the  gas/liquid  contacting  device  times  the  square  root  of the  ratio  of  the  gas  density  over  the  liquid  density  minus  the  gas density.  With  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  according  to  the present  invention  the  entrainment  of  liquid  in  the  gas  leaving  the outlet  section  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  is substantially  reduced.<br>
To  iir^rove  contacting,   the  lower  end  of  the  contact  section  12 of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  10,   under  the  lowermost tangential  gas  inlet  16  is  provided  with  a  vortex  breaker  in  the form  of  a  vertical  flat  plate  38  arranged  on  the  cover  18,   the  lower end  of  the  liquid  delivery  tube  19  rests  in  recess  40  in  the  upper edge  of  the  flat  plate  38.   The  vortex  breaker  may  as  well  include two  flat  plates,   wherein  one  flat  plate  is  in  the  plane  of  drawing (like  flat  plate  38),   and  wherein  the  second  flat  plate   (not  shown) is  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  drawing.<br>
The  outlet  section  25  can  con^rise  more  than  the  two  coalescer strips  32  which  are  shown  in  the  drawing,   for  example  between  3  and 5,   all  coalescer  strips  are  suitably  arranged  at  regular  intervals along  the  outer  surface  of  the  gas  permeable  wall  provided  with<br><br>
coalescer  means  25.   The  width  of  a  coalescer  strip  is  about  10%  of the  length  of  the  circumference  of  the  gas  permeable  wall.<br>
The  cross-section  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device  as discussed  with  reference  to  the  drawing  is  circular,   however,   the cross-section  can  be  polygonal  as  well.<br>
It  will  be  understood  that  the  lower  end  of  the  liquid  delivery tube  19  is  arranged  under  the  lowermost  tangential  gas  inlet  16,   so that,   during  normal  operation,   liquid  present  in  the  lower  end  of each  of  the  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  devices  8  and  10  seals  the liquid  delivery  tube  19.   In  order  to  allow  filling  the  lower  end  of each  of  the  contact  tubes,   the  wall  of  each  contact  tube  is  provided with  a  small  aperture   (not  shown)   arranged  above  the  plate  of  the horizontal  tray  to  which  the  contact  tube  pertains  and  below  the inlet  opening  24  of  the  downcomer  tube  23.  To  allow  dirtying  the lower  end  of  a  tubular  gas/liquid  contact  device,   the  cover  18  at the  bottom  of  the  contact  section  12  is  provided  with  a  small aperture   (not  shown).   The  size  of  the  apertures  in  the  wall  and  in the  cover  is  so  selected  that  the  presence  of  the  apertures  does  not adversely  affect  the  separation  performance  of  the  tubular gas/labroid  contact  device.<br><br><br>
