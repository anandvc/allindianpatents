				<td>The  invention  relates to a micro—wind  generator  for rural  lighting, particularly to a low cost generator.<br>
In India, the use of wind energy for power-  generation, is in developing stage. The main factor for lack of wider use  of wind  generators  is the relatively high cost. Unlike  the  solar-panels  for  lighting application, which are available?  in  ml'cro sizes, the wind generators are still at the micro level, for  use<br>
by  a whole village/community. These macro level wind  generators;-<br><br>
oeed   a   lot   of   capital    and   thus   havenot   become   popular.<br><br>
Distinguishing  features of said invention as  compared to the prior art are ss follows<br>
a)	It  uses  bicycle  parts  which  can  be   easily<br>
m a i nt ai ne d  b y  e v e n p eop 1e  o f re mo t e  village s<br>
heving very little technical background.<br>
b)	Since this design ingeniously uses bicycle  parts<br>
it is cheap to be within the affordable range  of<br>
rurs1 peop1e,<br>
c)	It   does  not   require  a  tail  for   changing<br>
d i re c t i on.<br>
d)	This design has a feature to adjust the angle  of<br>
blades  to cater for seasonal variations in  wind<br>
speed .<br><br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is to propose a micro-wind generator which is simple and less skill required to operate and will be available at low cost and easy availability of parts even in villages.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose s micro-wind generator which can be produced in knock-down kit and psort able and can be quickly erected by fixing it on a pole held by ropes,<br>
Yet another object rf the present invention is to propose a micro-wind generator to be used both in houses as well as for street lighting.<br>
A furthe" object of the present invention is to propose a micro-wind generator for charging batteries specially in coastal. 1 areas for night fishing in boats.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to propose a micro-wind generator which is easy to maintain even in rural environment.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a micro-wind generator for rural lighting comprising a rotor made of bicycle wheel with tyre, hub with spoke, axle with<br>
ball bearing and mounted on wooden beam, a bicycle dynamo<br>
to is operatively connected/the wheel and rim with tyre and<br>
a plurality of sticks radially mounted on to the said bicycle wheel and rim with tyre and radially outwardly mounted on the said sticks are blades made of half plastic bucket and triangular sails made of polythene cloth and the entire assembly is mounted on to a pole through a bicycle fork.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig.1 -  shows  the  assembly of  the wind generator with rotor blades and the dynamo.<br>
Fig.2 -  shows  the assembly of  the wind generator mounted on bicycle fork.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the micro-wind generator comprises of the following main components:<br>
i)   Rotor ii)   System for direction Orientation<br>
iii)   The support structure iv)   The electrical system<br>
ROTOR<br>
The supporting frame for the rotor blades (5) is provided by a bicycle wheel (3) viz. the rim and hub with spokes (4) and the axle with balls for the bearing. For the blades (5) either of the alternatives listed below can be used.<br>
a)	Blades  (5)  can be made from old plastic buckets.<br>
The bottom of the bucket are removed and the bucket<br>
cut lengthwise into pieces. Small round sticks (4)<br>
or PVC conduit pipes are to be tied by G.I. Wire to<br>
the hub and rim (4)  of the bicycle wheel (3);  and<br>
the plastic bucket pieces are in turn to be tied<br>
to  these  sticks  (6).   Plastic  bucket pieces  form<br>
excellent blades as they are not only light, but they<br>
also have a very good and smooth profile.  For a<br>
commercial model moulded plastic blades can be used.<br>
b)	Woven polythene cloth of the fertilizer bags are used<br>
in the form of triangular or trapezoidal sails (7).<br>
They are very  light  and easily available  in  the<br>
villages at a very low cost.<br>
DRIVE FOR THE DYNAMO<br>
The rotor (1) drives an ordinary 12V or 16V bicycle dynamo (2) which is easily available at a very low cost.<br>
The rotor (1) drives the dynamo (2) through the rubber tyre of a bicycle mounted on the rim (4). It is not only difficult but also unnecessary to keep the tyre inflated by filling air inside the tube. Hence, an ingenious method was used to fill the space inside the tyre. Another old bicycle tyre was fitted inside the outside tyre and the space within the inside tyre filled by 2 rows garden hose pipe. The outer tyre can also be an old tyre unfit for bicycle use.<br>
At locations where the wind velocities are	high the<br>
dynamo can be driven directly by the rotor tyre,	in which<br>
case the dynamo (2) would rotate at 36 times the	speed of<br>
rotor (1 ).<br>
For locations where the wind velocities are low but fairly prevalent for a number of hours during the day, a step-up unit (10) is used. It is made up of a bicycle hub and axle (4), with a small rubber wheel mounted on one end and a children's perambulator wheel on the other end. The smaller rubber wheel is the one used for children's bicycle trainer (support) wheel. The dynamo is then driven by the bigger perambulator wheel. With the introduction of the step-up unit the dynamo rotates at approximately 80 times the rotor speed.<br>
For increasing the generating capacity, a car dynamo with belt drive from the bicycle wheel rim can be used.<br>
SYSTEM FOR DIRECTION ORIENTATION<br>
The rotor axle is fixed to a wooden beam (8) which in turn is fixed to a bicycle fork (9). The bicycle fork (9) assembly as available in the market has ball bearings for smooth rotation about its vertical axis. Unlike a conventional windmill this design does not make use of a tail for orientation, and also the wind flows from back to front of the rotor. The plane of the rotor is away from the vertical axis; so, with a change in the wind direction, the forward thrust component of wind force on the rotor, produces a couple tending to align the rotor in the direction of wind. Further advantage is taken of the design feature of a bicycle fork viz. that the fork is cranked, the plane of the axle is away from the vertical axis. By making use of a slot in the fixing beam, this offset can be so adjusted, that in very high winds, the turning couple due to this offset turns the rotor at an angle to wind direction thus preventing it from overspeeding. This safety feature in a conventional windmill is achieved by the folding tail design.<br>
If the feature of direction orientation is to be made more sensitive then a small board/sheet of sheet metal can be attached in the front of rotor to the threaded axle of rotor, by a pipe with a nut welded at its end.<br>
SUPPORT STRUCTURE<br>
The vertical pipe portion of the fork supporting the rotor can be inserted into a G.I. pipe, which in turn can<br>
be fixed on to the outside wall of a house. Alternative arrangements of the support structure can be<br>
a)	Clamping the fork on to a pole, which in turn can<br>
be held firmly by ropes.<br>
b)	The fork can be clamped on to the pole of the street<br>
lamp for which it is providing energy.<br>
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM<br>
The current/power produced by a dynamo is of alternating nature. Also it is of varying frequency on account of variation in the wind velocities. Such intermittent power inputs of varying nature are not of any direct practical use; hence it is to be stored and used when required. For storage this alternating current is to be converted into d.c. using diodes and then stored in a battery. To increase the amount of charge stored, it is desirable to have a bigger differential voltage between the dynamo and the battery. Therefore, a 6V battery is more suitable. Alternatively, a 12V car battery can be used after getting a terminal moulded on the 3rd cell. Thus, 2 dynamos can be used to charge a 12V battery or each bunch of 3 cells of the battery can be charged on alternate days by a single dynamo using a selector switch. To increase the generation voltage arrangement can be made to connect 2 dnamos in series after full wave rectification of current produced by each of 2 dynamos. A 12V, used car battery, is sufficient for the lighting application.<br>
For the lights the user can use the bicycle headlamps. For better illumination of 6W fluorescent lamps can be used which would consume the same amount of power as the bicycle head lamps.<br>
Subject matter of the claim constitutes an invention in view of the fo1lowings<br>
a)	This design ingeniously utilizes parts of bicycle,<br>
whereas prior designs have specially designed  and<br>
m a n u f a c t u r e d  (c u s t o m  b u i1t) p arts.  Th i s  design<br>
thus  makes it cheap to be within  the  affordable<br>
r- a n g e o f rural people.<br>
b)	This  design is novel in the respect that it  does<br>
not  require  a tail for changing  direction.  The<br>
distance  between  the  plane  of  rotor  and  the<br>
vertical  axis  of orientation  clubbed  with  the<br>
force  acting  on  rotor  provides  the  necessary<br>
couple for orientation.<br>
c)	This  design is also novel as it does not  need  a<br>
a  costly  folding  tail  feature  to  protect  it<br>
against  overspeeding in case of strong winds.  On<br>
the  other  hand  it utilises the  offset  of  the<br>
bicycle fork to turn it away from the direction of<br>
w i n d  in case of h ig h  w i n d  v e 1 oc i t i e s.<br><br>
d) This design is novel in yet another aspect that small micro-wind generators of the prior arts have only fixed blades, whereas this design has a feature to adjust the angle of blades to ester for seasonal variations in wind speeds.<br>
