Fig. 2 is a conceptual diagram of a method for determining a correction value on the basis of a predetermined temperature characteristic of a quartz oscillator at 25°C and a temperature characteristic at a time when the adjustment temperature has deviated from 25^ in accordance with the embodiment.<br>
Description of a Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings, a detailed description will be given of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a means for adjusting a quartz oscillator in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, in which reference numeral 1 denotes a portable telephone terminal on which a trimmer 2, a quartz oscillator 3  a storage device 4, a thermistor 5, and the like are mounted.  It should be noted that a bar code 6 including information on the temperature characteristic of the quartz oscillator 3 is printed on the quartz oscillator 3.<br>
Reference numeral 10 denotes a frequency adjusting device serving as the means for adjusting the quartz oscillator, and the frequency adjusting device 10 h^.s .a noncontact temperature sensor- 11 for measuring the surface temperature of the quartz oscillator 3 at the time of the frequency adjustment.  In addition, reference numeral 20<br><br>
denotes a temperature-compensating-data writing device, which has a bar code reader 21 for reading the bar code printed on the quartz oscillator 3.<br>
Next, a description will be given of the operation in this embodiment.  First, the frequency adjustment of the quartz oscillator is effected by the frequency adjusting device 10.  The trimmer 2 is rotated by using an adjusting jig 12 such as a screwdriver so as to adjust the frequency to a predetermined level.  At that juncture, the surface temperature of the quartz oscillator 3 at the time of adjustment is measured by means of the noncontact temperature sensor 11, and that information is written into the storage device 4 of the portable telephone terminal 1.<br>
In the next step, the temperature characteristic information written in the bar code 6 on the quajrtz oscillator 3 is read by the bar code reader 21, and is inputted to the temperature-compensating-data writing device 20, which in turn extracts optimum temperature compensating data from among the temperature -couipensating data of a plurality of patterns stored in advance.  Further, the temperature information measured by the noncop-bact temperature sensor 11 at the -time of adjustment and stored in the storage device 4 is read, and a frequency deviation with the frequency at the time of adjustment at a standard<br><br>
temperature of 25^ is calculated to determine a correction value.  The temperature compensating data extracted above is corrected by that correction value, and the corrected temperature compensating data is written into the storage device 4 of the portable telephone terminal 1.<br>
In the portable telephone terminal 1, the quartz oscillator generate a signal having a frequency controlled through a control circuit (software) on the basis of the temperature* information detected by the thermistor^ 5 and the temperature compensating data written in the storage device 4, so as to effect temperature compensation. Namely in the control circuit, based on the basis of the temperature information detected by the thermistor 5 and the temperature compensating data written in the storage device 4, CPU calculates a optimum voltage compensated to be applied to the quartz oscillator through a D/A converter.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a method for determining a correction value on the basis of the predetermined temperature characteristic of the quartz oscillator at the standard temperature 25^ and the temperature characteristic at a time when the adjustment temperature has deviated from 25°C. In the drawing, a shows the frequency characteristic of the quartz oscillator at the time of standard adjustment at 25^, while h  shows the frequency characteristic of the<br><br>
quartz oscillator at the time of arbitrary adjustment, and the frequency deviation c between them is determined.  By using this frequency deviation c as a correction value, the temperature correcting data is corrected.<br>
In accordance with this embodiment configured as described above, since the information on the temperature characteristic of the quartz oscillator 3 written individually in the bar code 6 is read, it is possible to select optimum temperature compensating data for the quartz oscillator 3.  In addition, even if adjustment is made under any temperature environment, by measuring the temperature at that time by the noncontact temperature sensor 11, the frequency deviation c with the frequency at the time of measurement at the standard temperature of 25°C is determined, and the temperature compensating data is corrected by usxng this frequency deviation c as the correction value. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a quartz oscillator which undergoes a small temperature deviation in all the temperature range (-2Q°C to 60°C) .<br>
As described above, in accordance with the present invention, since the temperature compensating data for the quartz oscillator is stored in advance in the adjusting means, an advantage is -offered in that a quartz oscillator excelling in the temperature characteristic can be obtained by writing in advance the temperature<br><br>
compensating data, which is optimally suited to the individual quartz oscillator mounted in the portable telephone terminal, into the portable telephone terminal and by controlling the same through software.  Further, since the frequency deviation based on the difference between the temperature at the time of frequency adjustment and the standard temperature is corrected by determining the frequency deviation by measuring the temperature at the time of adjustment, an advantage is offered in that the quartz oscillator can be adjusted to be provided with a small frequency deviation at any temperature.<br><br><br><br><br>
