Figure no. 6 shows the details construction of the Hall Effect based contact less switch which is utilized as control switches on the steering assembly. The surface mountable integrated circuit (37) is mounted on the flexible printed circuit board (34). The surface of the switch (38) has a arrangement for mounting the single pole magnet (36). The Cap of the switch holds the magnet in a socket which is part of the switch inner surface. The air gap in between the surface of the switch (38) is adjusted in such a way that it switches OFF the surface mountable integrated circuit (37). The switch has a spring loaded mechanism. The air gap between the single pole magnet (36) and the integrated circuit (37) is so high that the magnet (36) does not actuate the integrated circuit (37), this condition is called as normally open or normally off condition. When the contact less switch surface (38) is mechanically displaced downwards in the vertical direction by the driver, the single pole magnet (36) comes closer to the integrated circuit (37) i.e. the air gap between the magnet (36) and the integrated circuit (37) reduces and it comes in the operating filed. This actuates the switch and the state of the switch changes from OFF to ON.  That is by default the switch is in<br><br><br>
non actuated position and it actuates only when the contact less switch is physically operated.<br>
Figure no. 7 shows the electronic circuit diagram of a Hall Effect switch which could be utilized for this application. More recent devices incorporate advances in the ability to amplify the signal, in addition to the utilization of on-chip, offset cancellation techniques, which have allowed Hall-effect sensing technology to be employed even under extreme environmental conditions, such as under-hood applications in automobiles.<br>
Furthermore, the "non-contacting" operation of Hall-effect sensors affords the user a nearly infinite life with regard to actuation and switching. The diodes (39) are used for reverse supply protection and also the circuit provides protection against spike. The circuit provides regulated supply for all the internal sub circuits. The digital switched input is processed internally by the integrated circuit (37). The switching noise is eliminated by the low pass circuit. The sample and hold circuit (38) is a integral part of the integral part of the integrated circuit (37). The processed signal is available as Vout of the integrated circuit switch (37). This input is given to the controller unit integrated circuit which processes the logic which is in form of instructions or program.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
