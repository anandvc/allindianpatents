				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of a novel polymer alloy useful for making protective coatings.<br>
This novel polymer alloy is a high performance alloy of epoxy, urethane and polyacrylate polymers formed by interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) technique and is a base material which when cured with an appropriate curing agents is capable of forming films under ambient conditions. These polymer alloy films obtained by curing with an appropriate curing agent possess highly improved corrosion, chemical and weather resistance and mechanical properties over that of the individual component polymers and using this novel polymer alloy as the base binder material, henceforth a large variety of new organic coatings suitable to a number of applications requiring improved corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, can be formulated.<br>
Hitherto a number of individual polymeric systems such as alkyds, acrylics, phenolics, chlorinated rubber, epoxy-polyamide, polyurethane etc., have been used as binder materials for formulating various types of coatings, the last two systems being more effective and versatile, are commonly used for corrosion protection. These individual ambient curing crosslinked polymer systems (epoxy-polyamide and polyurethane) provide coatings with good corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties. Hitherto for some specialised applications wherein improved properties are required, two individual monomers are sometimes chemically blended (co-polymerisation, the product is co-polymer) in which the individual monomers are linked by means of covalent bonds. This type of co-polymerisation to result in co-polymers is possible for selected polymer classes. For polymers which do not have possibilities for co-polymerisation, the other way of improving film properties has been hitherto mere physical blending of two or more such incompatible polymers after the process of polymerisation of the individual polymers is completed, to result in some improvements in the final film properties obtained thereafter. In these cases of polymer blends, the molecules of individual polymers are only physically blended leading to some enhancement in properties which is very limited in scope and superficial<br>
in character. The individual polymeric molecules of the final blend are susceptible to micro-separation on ageing under service conditions resulting in the loss of integrity of the film due to the inherent incompatibility of the polymers and thereby meeting premature failures. In the present technique of alloying different incompatible polymers, instead of mere physical blending, the individual polymers (either linear or crosslinked) are synthesised in such a way that during the polymerisation process the polymeric molecules are entangled/interlocked physically and permanently like a woven fabric to form a network of the polymers. The films obtained from these polymer alloys show better resistance to corrosion and chemicals. Because of a network formation in this kind of polymer alloy, besides better corrosion resistance, mechanical properties are also enhanced over that of the individual component polymers from which the polymer alloy is made. Because of these improved properties, new varieties of coatings possessing improved corrosion resistance and mechanical properties over the conventional epoxy-polyamide and polyurethane systems can be formulated for application in a variety of aggressive environments.<br>
The technique of alloying polymers is based on taking two or more incompatible polymers and making them compatibilised using a special kind of synthetic procedures in such a way that the component polymers get alloyed through permanent physical entanglements (without forming any covalent bonds between them). This type of alloying of polymers for getting improved properties is a novel process in the field of surface coatings.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel polymer alloy useful for making protective coatings which possess improved corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, UV resistance, mechanical properties and ability to provide protective coatings with suitable pigmentation.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel polymer alloy useful for making protective coatings whkh comprises refluxing an oligomeric resin comai«ing termmal oxirane oxygen and having molecular weight
