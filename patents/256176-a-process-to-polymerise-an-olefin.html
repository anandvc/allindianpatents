				<td>POLYMERIZATION PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for polymerizing olefin(s). Generally, the invention relates to polymerization catalyst compositions, and to methods for introducing the catalyst compositions into a polymerization reactor. More particularly, the method combines a catalyst component slurry with a catalyst component solution to form the completed catalyst composition for introduction into the polymerization reactor. The invention also relates to methods of preparing the catalyst component slurries, the catalyst component solutions, and the catalyst compositions, to methods of controlling the properties of polymer products utilizing the catalyst compositions, and to polymers produced therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts the choice of polymerization (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase) for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Especially illustrative of these advances is the development of technology utilizing bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems and other advanced metallocene-type catalyst systems.<br>
To utilize these systems in industrial slurry or gas phases processes, it is useful that the catalyst compound be immobilized on a earner or support such as, for example silica or alumina. The use of supported or heterogeneous catalysts increases process efficiencies by assuring that the forming polymeric particles achieve a shape and density that improves reactor operability and ease of handling. However, bulky ligand metallocene and metallocene-type catalysts typically exhibit lower activity when supported than when<br><br>
utilized in unsupported or homogeneous form. This "support effect" makes commercialization of these promising catalyst systems more difficult.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,3 17,036 and 5,693,727 and European publication EP-A-0 593 083 and PCT publication WO 97/46599 all describe various processes and techniques for introducing liquid unsupported catalysts to a polymerization reactor.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,069,213 discloses combining a supported and an unsupported metallocene catalysts in the polymerization of olefms, European publication EP 0 965 601 A disclose a combination of a solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst with a liquid catalyst in toluene or Kaydol activated with methyl alumoxane or modified methyl alumoxane, and Chinese Published Patent Application No. 971 16451.7 discloses combining an unsupported metallocene with a supported methylalumoxane. None of these references, however, discloses a catalyst composition prepared by continuously combining a catalyst component slurry with a catalyst component solution, then introducing the combination into an operating polymerization reactor.<br>
While all these methods have been described in the art, there exists a need to reduce the support effect for bulky ligand metallocene and metallocene-type polymerization catalyst compositions, for an improved method for introducing catalyst compositions, and especially for introducing mixed catalyst compositions, into a polymerization reactors, and for methods to control the properties of polymer products utilizing such catalyst compositions.<br>
The invention generally provides polymerization catalyst compositions and methods for introducing the catalyst compositions into a polymerization reactor. More particularly, the method combines a catalyst component containing slurry and a catalyst component containing solution to form the completed catalyst composition for introduction into the polymerization reactor. The invention is also directed to methods of preparing the catalyst component shiny, the catalyst component solution, and the catalyst compositions, to methods of controlling the properties of polymer products utilizing the catalyst compositions, arid to polymers produced therefrom.<br><br>
In one aspect, (he invention provides a process to polymerize olefin(s) which includes the steps of continuously combining a catalyst component slurry with a catalyst component solution to form a catalyst composition and introducing the catalyst composition and one or more olefin(s) into an operating polymerization reactor.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a process to control polymer properties which includes the steps of continuously combining a catalyst component slurry with a catalyst component solution to form a catalyst composition, introducing the catalyst composition into a polymerization reactor with one or more olefm(s) to form a polymer product, measuring a sample of the polymer product to obtain an initial product property and changing a process parameter to obtain a second product property.<br>

Preferably a support is combined with alumoxane, spray dried and then placed in mineral oil to form a slurry useful in the instant invention.    •<br>
In another embodiment, the catalyst compounds described above have been combined with optional support material(s) and or optional activator(s) and spray dried prior to being combined with the slurry diluent.<br>
In another embodiment, the catalyst compounds and/or the activators are preferably combined with a support material such as a particulate filler material and then spray dried, preferably to form a free flowing powder. Spray drying may be by any means known in<br><br>
the art. Please see EP A 0 668 295 Bl, U.S. Patent No. 5,674,795 and U.S. Patent No. 5,672,669 and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/464,114 filed December 16, 1999, which particularly describe spray diying of supported catalysts. In general one may spray diy the catalysts by placing the catalyst compound and the optional activator in solution (allowing the catalyst compound and activator to react, if desired), adding a filler material such as silica or fumed silica, such as Gasil™ or Cabosil ™, then forcing the solution at high pressures through a nozzle. The solution may be sprayed onto a surface or sprayed such that the droplets diy in midair. The method generally employed is to disperse the silica in toluene, stir in the activator solution, and then stir in the catalyst compound solution. Typical slurry concentrations are about 5 to 8 wt%. This formulation may sit as a slurry for as long as 30 minutes with mild stirring or manual shaking to keep it as a suspension before spray-diying. In one preferred embodiment, the makeup of the dried material is about 40-50 wt% activator (preferably alumoxane), 50-60 SiO2 and about~2 wt% catalyst compound.<br>
In another embodiment, fumed silica such as such as Gasil™ or Cabosil ™ may be added to a solution containing a catalyst compound such that when that solution is added to the catalyst component slurry or injected into a polymerization reactor, the fumed silica acts as a template for "in situ spray" drying.<br>
For simple catalyst compound mixtures, the two or more catalyst compounds can be added together in the desired ratio in the last step. In another embodiment, more complex procedures are possible, such as addition of a first catalyst compound to the activator/filler mixture for a specified reaction time t, followed by the addition of the second catalyst compound solution, mixed for another specified time x, after which the mixture is cosprayecl. Lastly, another additive, such as 1-hexene in about 10 vol% can be present in the activator/filler mixture prior to the addition of the first metal catalyst compound.<br>
In another embodiment binders are added to the mix. These can be added as a means of improving the particle morphology, i.e. narrowing the particle size distribution, lower porosity of the particles and allowing for a reduced quantity of alumoxane, which is acting as the 'binder'.<br><br>
In another embodiment a solution of a bulky ligand metallocene compound and optional activator can be combined with a different slurried spray dried catalyst compound and then introduced into a reactor.<br>
The spray dried particles are generally fed into the polymerization reactor as a mineral oil slurry. Solids concentrations in oil are about 10 to 30 weight %, preferably 15 to 25 weight %. In some embodiments, the spray dried particles can be from less than about 10 micrometers in size up to about 100 micrometers, compared to conventional supported catalysts which are about 50 micrometers.

In another preferred embodiment the activator is present on the support at between about 0.5 to about 7 mmol/g, preferably about 2 to about 6 mmol/g, more preferably between about 4 to about 5 mmol/g. In another preferred embodiment the total amount of catalyst compound present on the support, preferably a supported activator, is about 1 to about 40 fimol/g, preferably about 10 to about 38 umol/g, more preferably 30 to 36 fimol/g.<br>
In one embodiment the final mole ratio (i.e. after combination of the solution and the slurry) of the metal of the catalyst compounds and the metal of the activator is in the range of from about 1000:1 to about 0.5:1 preferably from about 300:1 to about 1:1 more preferably from about 150:1 to about 1:1; for boranes, borates, aluminates, etc., the ratio is preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1 and for alkyl aluminum compounds (such as<br><br>
dielhylaluminum chloride combined with water) the ratio is preferably about 0.5:1 to about 10:1.<br>
In one embodiment, the catalyst compound used in the slurry is not soluble in the solvent used in the solution. By "not soluble" is meant that the not more than 5 weight % of the material dissolves into the solvent at 20 °C and less than 3 minutes of stirring, preferably not more than 1 weight %, preferably not more than 0.1 weight %, preferably not more than 0.01 weight%. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst compound used in the slurry at least only sparingly soluble in an aromatic hydrocarbon. In a particularly preferred embodiment the catalyst compound used in the slurry is not soluble in mineral oil, aromatic solvent or aliphatic hydrocarbon (pentane, heptane, etc.).<br>
D. Delivery of the Catalyst Composition<br>
In the process of the invention, the catalyst component slurry is combined with and/or reacted with the catalyst component solution to form a catalyst composition in-line. The catalyst composition so formed is then is introduced into the polymerization reactor. Generally the catalyst composition is introduced to the reactor utilizing a catalyst feed system which includes a catalyst component slurry holding vessel, a catalyst component solution holding vessel, and a slurry feeder.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, in one embodiment, the catalyst component slurry, preferably a mineral oil slurry including at least one support and at least one activator, preferably at least one supported activator, and optional catalyst compound(s) is placed in a vessel (A). In a preferred embodiment (A) is an agitated holding tank designed to keep the solids concentration homogenous. The catalyst component solution, prepared by mixing a solvent and at least one catalyst compound and/or activator, is placed in a vessel (C). The catalyst component slurry is then combined in-line with the catalyst component solution to form a final catalyst composition. A nucleating agent, such as silica, alumina, fumed silica or any other particulate matter (B) may be added to the slurry and/or the solution in-line or in the vessels (A) or (C). Similarly, additional activators or catalyst compounds may be added in-line. The catalyst component slurry and solution are preferably mixed in-line at some point (E) for a period of time. For example, the solution<br><br>
and slurry may be mixed by utilizing a static mixer or an agitating vessel. The mixing of the catalyst component slurry and the catalyst component solution should be long enough to allow the catalyst compound in the catalyst component solution to disperse in the catalyst component shiny such that the catalyst component, originally in the solution, migrates to the supported activator originally present in the slurry. The combination thereby becomes a uniform dispersion of catalyst compounds on the supported activator forming the catalyst composition of the invention. The length of time that the slurry and the solution are contacted is typically up to about 120 minutes, preferably about 1 to about 60 minutes, more preferably about 5 to about 40 minutes, even more preferably about 10 to about 30 minutes.<br>
In another embodiment, an aluminum alkyl, an ethoxylated aluminum alkyl, an alumoxane, an anti-static agent or a borate activator, such as a C, to C,5 alkyl aluminum (for example tri-isobutyl aluminum, trimethyl aluminum or the like), a C, to C,5 elhoxylated alkyl aluminum or methyl alumoxane, ethyl alumoxane, isoburylalumoxane, modified alumoxane or the like are added to the mixture of the slurry and the solution in line. The alkyls, antistatic agents, borate activators and/or alumoxanes may be added (F), directly to the combination of the solution and the slurry, or may be added via an additional alkane (such as isopentane, hexane, heptane, and or octane) carrier stream (G). Preferably, the additional alkyls, antistatic agents, borate activators and/or alumoxanes are present at up to about 500 ppm, more preferably at about 1 to about 300 ppm, more preferably at 10 to about 300 ppm, more preferably at about 10 to about 100 ppm. Preferred carrier streams include isopentane and or hexane. The alkane may be added (G) to the mixture of the slurry and the solution, typically at a rate of about 0.5 to about 60 Ibs/hr (27 kg/hr). Likewise carrier gas, such as nitrogen, argon, ethane, propane and the like may be added in-line (H) to the mixture of the slurry and the solution. Typically the carrier gas may be added at the rate of about 1 to about 100 Ib/hr (0.4 to 45 kg/hr), preferably about 1 to about 50 Ib/hr (5 to 23 kg/hr), more preferably about 1 to about 25 Ib/hr (0.4 to 11 kg/hr).<br>
In another embodiment, a liquid earner stream is introduced into the combination of the solution and slurry (hat is moving in a downward direction. The mixture of the<br><br>
solution, the slurry and the liquid earner stream may pass through an optional mixer or length of tube for mixing before being contacted with a gaseous carrier stream.<br>
Similarly, hexene (or other alpha-olefm or diolefm) may be added in-line (J) to the mixture of the slurry and the solution. The shiny/solution mixture is then preferably passed tlirough an injection tube (O) to the reactor (Q). In some embodiments, the injection tube may aerosolize the slurry/solution mixture. In a preferred embodiment the injection tube has a diameter of about 1/16 inch to about 1/2 inch (0.16 cm to 1.27 cm), preferably about 3/16 inch to about 3/8 inch (0.5 cm to 0.9 cm), more preferably 1/4 inch to about 3/8ths inch (0.6 cm to 0.9 cm).<br>
In one embodiment cycle gas (also called re-cycle gas) is introduced into the support lube (S), in another embodiment monomer gas, such as ethylene gas, is introduced into the support tube. Nucleating agents (K), such as fumed silica, can be added directly in to the reactor.<br>
In another embodiment a plenum may be used in this invention. A plenum is a device used to create a particle lean zone in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor, as described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,693,727 which is incorporated herein by reference. A plenum may have one, two, or more injection nozzles.<br>
In another embodiment when a metallocene catalyst or other similar catalyst is used in the gas phase reactor, oxygen and or fluorobenzene can be added to the reactor directly or to the recycle gas to affect the polymerization rate. Thus, when a metallocene catalyst (which is sensitive to oxygen or fluorobenzene) is used in combination with another catalyst (that is not sensitive to oxygen) in a gas phase reactor; oxygen can be used to modify the metallocene polymerization rate relative to the polymerization rate of the other catalyst. An example of such a catalyst combination is bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride and [(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)NCH2CH2]2NHZrBz2, where Me is methyl or bis(indenyl) zirconium dichloride and [(2,4,6-Me,C6H2)NCH2CH2]2NHHfBz2, where Me is methyl. For example if the oxygen concentration in the nitrogen feed is altered from 0.1 ppm to 0.5 ppm, significantly less polymer from the bisindenyl ZrCl2 will be produced and the relative amount of polymer<br><br>
produced from the [(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)NCH2CH2]2NHHfBz2 is increased. WO/09328 discloses the addition of water and or carbon dioxide to gas phase polymerization reactors.<br>
In another embodiment, referring still to Figure 1, the slurry .comprising mineral oil, at least one catalyst compound, a support and an activator is mixed in and/or introduced from (A). The catalyst component solution comprising a solvent, such as toluene, hexane, mineral oil or tetrahydrofuran, and a catalyst compound and/or an activator is mixed in and/or introduced from (C). Nucleating agent (B) and (K), such as fumed silica, may be added on line at one or more positions and may be wet or dry. The slurry and the solution are combined and typically mixed at (E). Optional light alkyls (F), such as triisobutyl aluminum, an alumoxane, modified methylalumoxane and/or trimethyl aluminum, may be added in line directly to the combination or via an alkane, such as isopenlane, feed (G). Nitrogen (H) and/or olefin, such as hexene, (J) may also be added in line. The combination may then be injected through an injection tube (O) (such as a 1/8 inch (0.3cm) tube) into a gas phase reactor (Q). The injection tube (O) may be supported inside a larger support tube (S), such as a 1 inch (2.54 cm) tube. Oxygen can be added directly to the reactor (Q) or to the recycle gas (P) to alter the activity of one or more catalysts. (R) is How (monomer, recycle gas, alkane) to the support tube (S).<br>
In another embodiment, catalyst ball formation and or general nozzle fouling were reduced by first feeding isopentane carrier from the feed line (G) into the combination of the solution and the slurry, thereafter the combination of the solution slurry and isopentane preferably moves in a vertical orientation with a downward flow into the reactor using a nitrogen sweep (H) to disperse the isopentane/slurry mixture into the reactor.<br>
The catalyst injection tube passes into the reactor through a compressed chevron packing and extends into the fluid bed a distance of about 0.1 inch to 10 feet (0.25 cm to 3.1 in), preferably about 1 inch to 6 ft (2.5 cm to 1.8 m), and more preferably about 2 inches to 5 feet (5 cm to 1.5 m). Typically, the depth of insertion depends on the diameter of the reactor and typically extends in about 1/20 to 1/2 of the reactor diameter, preferably about l/10th to 1/2 and more preferably about l/5th to l/3rd of the reactor diameter. The end of the tube may be cut perpendicular to the axis to create a nozzle cone or point with an angle ranging from 0 to 90 degrees, preferably ranging from about 10 to 80 degrees.<br><br>
The lip of the hole can be taken to a new knife-edge. The tube can be positioned to reduce resin adhesion or coated with an antifouling or antistatic compound. The tube can also be cut diagonally at an angle simply from about 0 to 80 degrees off the axial line of the tube, preferably about 0 to 60 degrees. The opening of the tube can be the same as the bore of the tube or expanded or diminished to create a nozzle, with sufficient pressure drop and geometry to provide a dispersed spray of a solution slurry and or powder into the reactor, preferably into the fluid bed.<br>
The injection tube can optionally be supported inside a structure within the fluid bed to provide structural integrity. This support tube is typically a heavy walled pipe with an internal diameter of from about 1/4 inch to about 5 inches (0.64 cm to 12.7 cm), preferably about 1/2 inch to about 3 inches (1.3 cm to 7.6 cm), and more preferably about 3/4 inch to about 2 inches (1.9 cm to 5 cm). The support tube preferably extends through (he reactor wall to approximately the length of the injection tube, allowing the injection tube to end just inside the end of the support lube or to extend past it up to about 10 inches (25.4 cm). Preferably, the injection tube extends about 0.5 to 5 inches (1.8 cm to 12.7 cm) beyond the end of the support tube and more preferably about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 cm to 7.6 cm). The end of the support tube in the reactor may be cut flat and perpendicular to the axis of the tube or preferably, may be tapered at an angle ranging from about 10 to 80 degrees. The end of the support tube may be polished or coated with an anti-static or antifouling material.<br>
A purge flow of fluid (R) (typically fresh monomer, ethylene, hexane, isopentane, recycle gas, and the like) is preferably introduced from outside the reactor down the support tube to aid in dispersion of the catalyst composition allowing the production of resin granular particles of good morphology with decreased agglomeration and an APS (average particle size) in the range of about 0.005 to 0.10 inches (.01 cm to 0.3 cm). The purge flow of fluid helps minimize fouling of the end of the catalyst injection tube and support tubes. The fluid introduced to the support tube may comprise hydrogen; olefins or dioleflns, including but not limited to C2 to C40 alpha olefins and C2 to C40 diolefins, ethylene, propylene, butene, hexene, octene, norbomene, pentene, hexadiene, pentadiene, isobutylene, octadiene, cyclopentadiene, comonomer being used in the polymerization<br><br>
reaction, hydrogen; alkanes, such C, to C40 alkanes, including but not limited to isopetane, hexane, ethane, propane, butane, and the like; mineral oil, cycle gas with or without condensed liquids; or any combination thereof. Preferably the support tube flow is fresh ethylene or propylene that may be heated. In addition, an alkane, such as for instance' isopenlane or hexane, can be included in the flow at the level ranging from about 0.001 wt %. to about 50% of the flow. The alkane can be dispersed in the flow and may exist as dispersed liquid droplets or be vaporized at the exit of the support tube. The presence of liquid may reduce fouling at the exit.<br>
The flow rate of fluid in the support tube ranges from about 5 to 10,000 pph and is somewhat dependent upon the reactor size. The linear velocity of the fluid in the support lube ranges from about 10 to 500 ft/sec (11 to 549 km/hr), preferably about 20 to 300 ft/sec (22 to 329 km/hr) and more preferably about 30 to 200 ft/sec (33 to 219 km/hr).<br>
Alternatively, the exit of the support tube may be fashioned as a nozzle at the end to form a jet or dispersion of gas to aid in the distribution of the catalyst composition. In one embodiment, the internal diameter of the support tube is reduced gradually by about 3 to 80% at the end, preferably about 5 to 50% in a taper to create a nozzle to accelerate to and or disperse the fluid flow. The insertion of the injection tube is not impacted by the internal taper of the support tube.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the contact time of the slurry and the solution can be varied to adjust or control formation of the active catalyst complex. The contact time of the slurry and the solution is preferably in the range of from 1 minute to 120 minutes, preferably in the range of from 2 minutes to 60 minutes, preferably 5 minutes to 45 minutes, more preferably from about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes.<br>
In another embodiment, the contact temperature of the slurry and the solution is in the range of from 0°C to about 80°C, preferably from about 0°C to about 60°C, more preferably from about 10°C to about 50°C and most preferably from about 20°C to about 40°C.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides introducing the immobilized catalyst system in the presence of a mineral oil or a surface modifier or a combination thereof as described in PCT publication WO 96/11960 and USSN 09/113,261 filed July<br><br>
10, 1998, which are herein fully incorporated by reference. In another embodiment a slurry or surface modifier, such as an aluminum stearate in mineral oil) is introduced (T) into the reactor with the combination of the shiny and the solution. In another embodiment the surface modifier, such as aluminum stearate, was added into the slurry vessel (A).<br>
In another embodiment the one or all of the catalysts are combined with up to 6 weight % of a metal stearate, (preferably a aluminum stearate, more preferably aluminum distearate) or an anti-static agent based upon the weight of the catalyst, any support and the stearate or anti-static agent, preferably 2 to 3 weight %. In one embodiment, a solution or slurry of the metal stearate or anti-static agent is fed into the reactor. The stearate or anti-static agent may be combined with the slurry (A) or the solution (C) or may be co-fed (R) with the combination of the slurry and the solution. In a preferred embodiment the catalyst compounds and or activators are combined with about 0.5 to about 4 weight % of an antistat, such as a methoxylated amine, such as Witco's Kemamine AS-990 from ICI Specialties in Bloomington Delaware.<br>
In another embodiment the catalyst system or the components thereof are combined with benzil, xylitol, Irganox™ 565, sorbitol or the like and then fed into the reactor. These agents may be combined with the catalyst compounds and/or activators or may be fed into the reactor in a solution with or without the catalyst system or its components. Similarly these agents may be combined with the slurry (A) or the solution (C) or may be co-fed (R) with the combination of the slurry and the solution.<br>
In another embodiment the process of this invention may further comprise additional solutions and slurries. For example, in a preferred embodiment a slurry can be combined with two or more solutions having the same or different catalyst compounds and or activators. Likewise, the solution may be combined with two or more slurries each having the same or different supports, and the same or different catalyst compounds and or activators. Similarly the process of this invention may comprise two or more slurries  • combined with two or more solutions, preferably in-line, where the slurries each comprise the same or different supports and may comprise the same or different catalyst compounds and or activators and the solutions comprise the same or different catalyst compounds and<br><br>
or activators. For example, the slurry may contain a supported activator and two different catalyst compounds, and two solutions, each containing one of the catalysts in the slurry, are each independently combined, in-line, with the slurry.<br>
E. Use of Catalyst Composition to Control Product Properties<br>
The timing, temperature, concentrations, and sequence of the mixing of the solution, the slurry and any optional added materials (nucleating agents, catalyst compounds, activators, etc) described above can be used to alter product properties. The melt index, relative amount of polymer produced by each catalyst, and other properties of the polymer produced may also be changed by manipulating process parameters which include manipulating hydrogen concentration in the polymerization system or by:<br>
1)	changing the amount of the first catalyst in the polymerization system, and/or<br>
2)	changing the amount of the second catalyst in the polymerization system, and/or<br>
3)	changing the hydrogen concentration in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
4)	changing the relative ratio of the catalyst in the polymerization process (and<br>
optionally adjusting their individual feed rates to maintain a steady or constant resin<br>
production rate); and/or<br>
5)	changing the amount of liquid and/or gas that is withdrawn and/or purged from the<br>
process; and/or<br>
6)	changing the amount and/or composition of a recovered liquid and/or recovered<br>
gas returned to the polymerization process, said recovered liquid or recovered gas being<br>
recovered from polymer discharged from the polymerization process; and/or<br>
7)	using a hydrogenation catalyst in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
8)	changing the polymerization temperature; and/or<br>
9)	changing the ethylene partial pressure in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
10)	changing the ethylene to comonomer ratio in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
11)	changing the activator to transition metal ratio in the activation sequence; and/or<br>
12)	changing the relative feed rates of the slurry and/or solution; and/or<br>
13)	changing the mixing time, the temperature and or degree of mixing of the slurry<br>
and the solution in-line; and/or<br><br>
14)	adding different types of activator compounds to the polymerization process;<br>
and/or<br>
15)	adding oxygen or fluorobenzene or other catalyst poison to the polymerization<br>
process.<br>
For example to alter the flow index and or melt index of a polymer produced according to the invention using a slurry of supported methylalumoxane and [(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)NCH2CH2]2NH} ZrBz2 and a solution of bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride one can alter the temperature of the reaction in the polymerization reactor, one can alter the concentration of hydrogen in the reactor, or one can alter the concentration of the bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride in the solution prior to contacting the solution with the slurry, or one can alter the relative feed rate of the catalyst component solution and/or the catalyst component slurry.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the flow index (I2I-measured according to ASTM D-1238, Condition E, at 190°C) of the polymer product is measured at regular intervals and one of the above factors, preferably temperature, catalyst compound feed rate, the ratio of the two or more catalysts to each other, monomer partial pressure, oxygen concentration, and or hydrogen concentration, is altered to bring the flow index to the desired level, if necessary. Preferably the samples for flow index measurements are melt- homogenized by extruding in an extruder that is equipped with either a single screw, preferably with a mixing head, or a twin screw, to make either tape or strand(s). The tape and or strands are typically cut into small pieces for flow property measurements.<br>
In an embodiment, a polymer product property is measured in-line and in response the ratio of the catalysts being combined is altered. In one embodiment, the molar ratio of the catalyst compound in the catalyst component slurry to the catalyst compound in the • catalyst component solution, after the slurry and solution have been mixed to form the final catalyst composition, is 500:1 to 1:500, preferably 100:1 to 1:100, more preferably 50:1 to 1:50 and most preferably 40:1 to 1:10. In another embodiment; the molar ratio of a Group 15 catalyst compound in the slurry to a bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound in the solution, after the slurry and solution have been mixed to form the catalyst composition, is 500:1, preferably 100:1, more preferably 50:1, more preferably<br><br>
10:1 and even more preferably 5:1. Preferably, the product property measured is the polymer product's flow index, melt index, density, MWD, comonomer content and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, when the ratio of the catalyst compounds is altered, the introduction rate of the catalyst composition to the reactor, or other process parameters, is altered to maintain a desired production rate.<br>
Likewise, the support architecture, the number of functional groups on the support (such as-OH groups on silica) the activator loading and the pre-impregnated catalyst loading can also affect the product formed.<br>
Similarly, altering the ethylene partial pressure can alter product properties. For example in a system where the solution comprised bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride and the slurry comprised [(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)NCH2CH2]2NHZrBz2 and supported methyl alumoxane, increasing the ethylene partial pressure in the gas phase reactor from 220 to 240 psi (1.5-1.7 MPa) increased the Flow Index from 100 to over 700 dg/rnin.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by or limited to any theory, the inventors believe, that the processes described herein immobilize the solution catalyst compound in and on a support, preferably a supported activator. The in-line immobilization techniques described herein preferably result in a supported catalyst system that when introduced to the reactor provides for better particle morphology, bulk density, and/or higher catalyst activities and without the need for additional equipment in order to introduce catalyst compound solution into a reactor, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase reactor. It is known in the art that typical support techniques for supporting, metallocene catalyst compounds results in lower overall productivity of the formed supported catalysts. In some instances the supporting process in fact renders certain of these catalyst compounds useless in commercial polymerization processes that especially prefer the utilization of supported catalysts. This is particularly true when comparing introducing an unsupported catalyst system into a gas phase process versus a conventional supported catalyst system. By conventional supported catalysts system it is meant those supported catalyst systems that are formed by contacting a support material, an activator and a catalyst compound in various ways under a variety of conditions outside of a catalyst feeder apparatus.<br><br>
Examples of conventional methods of supporting rnetallocene catalyst systems are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,701,432, 4,808,561, 4,912,075, 4,925,821, 4,937,217, 5,008,228, 5,238,892, 5,240,894, 5,332,706, 5,346,925, 5,422,325, 5,466,649, 5,466,766, 5,468,702, 5,529,965, 5,554,704, 5,629,253, 5,639,835, 5,625,015, 5,643,847, 5,665,665, 5,698,487, 5,714,424, 5,723,400, 5,723,402, 5,731,261, 5,759,940, 5,767,032, 5,770,664, 5,846,895 and 5,939,348 and U.S. Application Serial Nos. 271,598 filed July 7, 1994 and 788,736 filed January 23, 1997 and PCT publications WO 95/32995, WO 95/14044, WO 96/06187 and WO 97/02297, and EP-B1-0 685 494. It was also surprisingly discovered that catalyst systems not commercially supportable in a gas phase process in particular were found to be useful when immobilized using the process of the invention.<br>
VI. Polymerization Process<br>
The catalyst systems prepared and the method of catalyst system addition described above are suitable for use in any prepolyinerization and/or polymerization process over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The temperatures may be in the range of from -60 "C to about 280°C, preferably from 50°C to about 200°C, and the pressures employed may be in the range from 1 atmosphere to about 500 atmospheres or higher.<br>
Polymerization processes include solution, gas phase, slurry phase and a high pressure process or a combination thereof. Particularly preferred is a gas phase or slurry phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene and more preferably ethylene.<br>
In one embodiment, the process of this invention is directed toward a solution, high pressure, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefin monomers of ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-melhyl-pentene-l, hexene-1, octene-1 and decene-1.<br>
Other monomers useful in the process of the invention include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic olefins. Non-limiting<br><br>
monomers useful in the invention may include norbornene, norboniadiene, isobutylene,<br>
isoprene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene<br>
norbornene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, a copolymer of<br>
ethylene is produced, where with ethylene, a comonomer having at least one alpha-olefm<br>
having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and most<br>
preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, is polymerized in a gas phase process.<br>
In another embodiment of the process of the invention, elhylene or propylene is<br>
polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a<br>
diene, to form a terpolymer.<br>
In an embodiment, the mole ratio of comonomer to ethylene, CX/C2, where Cx is the<br>
amount of comonomer and C2 is the amount of ethylene is between about 0.001 to 0.200<br>
and more preferably between about 0.002 to 0.008.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a polymerization process, particularly a gas phase or shiny phase process, for polymerizing propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and/or other olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Polypropylene polymers may be produced using the particularly bridged bulky ligand metallocene catalysts as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,296,434 and 5,278,264, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304,<br><br>

A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C.  In a slimy polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from<br><br>
3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>

In an embodiment, the polymer of the invention may have a narrow molecular weight distribution and a broad composition distribution.or vice-versa, and may be those polymers described in U.S. Patent No. 5,798,427 incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In one embodiment the polymers produced by this invention have a mullimodal molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) or, a typically, bimodal molecular weight distribution. In a preferred embodiment, the polymer produced has a density of 0.93 to 0.96 g/cc, an MI (I2) of 0.03 - O.lOg/lOmin, an FI (12I) of 4-12 g/ lOmin, an MFR (I21/I2) of 80-180, an overall Mw of 200,000 to 400,000, an overall Mn of 5,000-10,000 and an Mw/Mn of 20-50. Preferably the low molecular weight fraction (-500 —50,000) has a density of 0.935-0.975 g/cc and the high molecular weight fraction (-50,000 - ~ 8,000,000) has a density of 0.910 - 0.950 g/cc. These polymers are particularly useful for film and pipe, especially, for PE-100 pipe applications.    More preferably, this embodiment of the polymer has the following molecular weight distribution (MWD) characteristics. The MWDs, as obtained from size exclusion chromatography (SEC), can be deconvolved using the bimodal fitting program. The preferred split of the polymer, the ratio of Wt% of HMW fraction and the Wt% of LMW fraction, is 20-80 to 80-20, more preferably 30-70 to 70-30, and even more preferably 40-60 to 60-40. Higher Wt% of HMW than LMW Wt% is preferred. The SEC curve can be further analyzed to give percent of Wt% &gt; 1MM, which is the weight percent of the total MWD that has a molecular weight greater than 1 million, and Wt% &gt; 100K, which is the weight perecent of the total MWD that is greater than 100,000 in molecular weight. The weight percent ratio is simply Wt% &gt; 1 MM divided by Wt% &gt; 1OOK.  100,000 was used as an approximate means of dividing the total MWD into a HMW (high molecular weight) and LMW (low molecular weight) region. This ratio gives a simple but sensitive indication of the relative amount of the very high molecular weight species in the HMW region of the MWD. The prefered embodiment of the polymer has the preferred range of weight percent ration (WPR), higher than 10 but less than 30, preferably higher than 15 but less than 25.

Preparation of SMAO Supported Activator<br>
For a IKg batch, 1158.43 grams of 30 wt % MAO in toluene (7.3 wt% Al) available from Albemarle Corporation, Baton Rouge, LA, and 2400 grams of extra toluene are charged into an 8 liter mix tank equipped with ribbon helical agitator. 984 grams of Davison 955-600 silica is added to MAO in toluene solution at ambient temperature. A 10°C exolhenn occurs<br>
from reaction of the MAO with the hydroxyl groups. The slurry mixes for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. Drying then occurs by heating the mix tank jacket to about 70°C and reducing pressure to 0.00 mm/hg. As the slurry thickens the agitator rpm is reduced to minimum rotation, about 40 - 60 RPM. Then the rotation is slowly increased (to about 600 RPM) and the temperature is raised to 95 ° C as the slurry turns to a diy powder. A nitrogen sweep (about 0.5 cc/min per gram of silica charged) can be used during the end of the drying step to help remove toluene from the silica pores. The material is typically held at 95°C until toluene removal stops, and material temperature lines out near jacket temperature. The material temperature does not change for at least 30 minutes before the supported melhylalumoxane (SMAO) is considered diy. Residual toluene is reduced to less than 2 wt% on the solids.<br>

Solution catalyst compound activated with slurry comprising supported activator in<br>
fluidized gas-phase reactor with shorter contact time<br>
Polymerization performance of in-line supported bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (P-MCN) was evaluated in a 8 inch (20.3 cm) fluidized bed pilot plant reactor. The catalyst feed configuration is shown schematically in Figure 2. P-MCN ( 1.7 umol/ml in hexane) was introduced in line at 0.65 g/hr. 0.5 weight % of TiBA in isopentane (200-250 cc/hr of isopentane carrier and 75-90 cc/hr of 0.5 wt% TiBA) was introduced in line. Thereafter a slurry comprising Kaydol mineral oil and 16 weight % of SMAO produced in Example 1 (4.5 rnmol/g solids) was introduced in line and allowed to mix with the solution of P-MCN and TiBA for 25-35 minutes. Following the mixer, the catalyst was injected using a standard 1/8 inch (0.32 cm) injection tube with 1.05 pph of N2 blowback.<br>
The catalyst was evaluated at LLDPE conditions, 75 C, 350 psig (2.4 MPa) total pressure, 120 psi (0.8 MPa) ethylene, 0.017 hexene-1 comonomer to ethylene ratio. No hydrogen was fed to the reactor since this catalyst makes sufficient hydrogen to produce 2-5 dg/min melt index polymer under the conditions employed. The superficial gas velocity (SGV) was maintained at 1.54 ft/s (0.47m/s) and the steady state bed weight at 27 Ibs (12.3 kg). The reactor was operated continuously, i.e. for approximately 13 hours per day, generally holding bed weight constant to yield a bed level near the top of the straight section. Where possible, the reactor was left closed overnight with the bed being fluidized<br><br>
in a nitrogen atmosphere. TiBA (triisobutyl aluminum) in isopentane was fed as a scavenger at approximately 75 ppm in the bed to give catalyst productivity that is commercially relevant.<br>
The product had a 6.1 dg/min (12), 1 7.6 MFR and 0.93 g/cc density. The resin average particle size was 0.022 inches (0.056 cm) with 2.4 wt% fines (

Polymerization performance of in-line supported bis(n-propyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (P-MCN) was evaluated in a 8 inch (20.3 cm) fluidized bed pilot plant reactor.
