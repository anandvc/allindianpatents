				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a lighting system using microwave, and more particularly, to<br>
an apparatus for supplying power to an electrodeless lighting system using microwave.<br>
2. Description of the Background Art<br>
A conventional lighting system using a microwave includes a relay unit for receiving an AC<br>
power and passing or cutting off the AC power according to a control signal; a high voltage<br>
transformer for transforming the AC power outputted from the relay unit to a DC power supply of<br>
high voltage and outputting the transformed power supply; a magnetron for receiving the DC power<br>
supply of high voltage and generating a microwave; a waveguide for inducing the microwave<br>
generated from a magnetron; an electrodeless light bulb for generating light by the induced<br>
microwave; a controller for generating a control signal; a cooling unit for receiving a power supply<br>
from the relay unit and cooling the heat generated from the magnetron and the high voltage<br>
transformer by themselves.<br>
The operation of the lighting system using microwave will now be described.<br>
First, the relay unit receives an AC power according to a control signal generated from the<br>
controller, and passes or cuts off the supplied AC power.<br>
The high voltage transformer transforms the AC power outputted from the relay unit,<br>
transforms the transformed AC power to a high voltage of DC component, and outputs the<br>
transformed high voltage of DC component to the magnetron.<br>
The magnetron receives the high voltage of DC component and generates microwave. The<br>
microwave is induced to the electrodeless light bulb through the waveguide.<br>
The electrodeless light bulb generates light by the induced microwave, and the generated light<br>
is radiated in the forward direction through a reflector.<br>
However, including a half-wave voltage doubler circuit, the high voltage transformer rectifies<br>
the AC power to a DC through the half-wave voltage doubler circuit and supplies it to the magnetron.<br>
That is, as the high voltage transformer includes the half-wave voltage doubler circuit that<br>
rectifies only a power supply (voltage / current) corresponding to a half of one period of a frequency<br>
of a general AC power, a ripple is generated due to the frequency characteristics of the general AC<br>
power, which causes a flicker phenomenon.<br>
Namely, since the light generated from the electrodeless light bulb flickers due to the flicker<br>
phenomenon, light is not stably radiated.<br>
Consequently, in the high voltage transformer of the lighting system using microwave in<br>
accordance with the conventional art, since the power is supplied to the magnetron through the half-<br>
wave voltage doubler, the ripple takes place due to the frequency characteristics of the general AC<br>
power.<br>
That is, the light generated from the electrodeless light bulb flickers because of the flicker<br>
phenomenon caused due to the ripple. (This has been explained hereinafter with reference to<br>
illustrative drawings).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a power supply apparatus of a<br>
lighting system, using microwave, that is capable of stably radiating light generated from the light<br>
bulb of the lighting system by supplying a stable power to a magnetron of a lighting system using<br>
microwave and removing a flicker phenomenon.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present<br>
invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a lighting system using<br>
microwave comprising: a relay unit for receiving an AC power, and passing or cutting off the AC<br>
power according to a control signal; a high voltage transformer for transforming the AC power<br>
outputted from the relay unit into a high voltage AC power and outputting the transformed AC<br>
power; a voltage doubler unit for transforming the high voltage AC power into a high voltage DC<br>
power, increasing a frequency of a current of the DC power by at least more than twice, and<br>
outputting the high voltage DC power having the increased frequency; a magnetron for receiving the<br>
high voltage DC power from voltage doubler unit and generating microwave; a waveguide for<br>
inducing the microwave; an electrodeless light bulb for generating a stable light without a flicker<br>
phenomenon by the induced microwave; and a controller for generating the control signal.<br>
To achieve the above objects, there is also provided a lighting system using microwave<br>
having a high voltage transformer transforming an AC power to a DC power of high voltage, a<br>
magnetron receiving the high voltage DC power and generating microwave and an electrodeless light<br>
bulb generating light by the microwave, including : a voltage doubler unit for increasing a frequency<br>
of the high voltage DC power and applying the high voltage DC power having the increased<br>
frequency to the magnetron.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the construction of a lighting system using microwave in accordance with<br>
a conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the conventional lighting system using a microwave includes : a relay<br>
unit 13 for receiving an AC power and passing or cutting off the AC power according to a control<br>
signal; a high voltage transformer 14 for transforming the AC power outputted from the relay unit 13<br>
to a DC power supply of high voltage and outputting the transformed power supply; a magnetron 15<br>
for receiving the DC power supply of high voltage and generating a microwave; a waveguide (not<br>
shown) for inducing the microwave generated from a magnetron 15; an electrodeless light bulb 16<br>
for generating light by the induced microwave; a controller 11 for generating a control signal; a<br>
cooling unit 12 for receiving a power supply from the relay unit 13 and cooling the heat generated<br>
from the magnetron 15 and the high voltage transformer 14 by themselves.<br>
The operation of the lighting system using microwave will now be described.<br>
First, the relay unit 13 receives an AC power according to a control signal generated from the<br>
controller 11, and passes or cuts off the supplied AC power.<br>
The high voltage transformer 14 transforms the AC power outputted from the relay unit 13,<br>
transforms the transformed AC power to a high voltage of DC component, and outputs the<br>
transformed high voltage of DC component to the magnetron 15.<br>
The magnetron 15 receives the high voltage of DC component and generates microwave. The<br>
microwave is induced to the electrodeless light bulb 16 through the waveguide.<br>
The electrodeless light bulb 16 generates light by the induced microwave, and the generated<br>
light is radiated in the forward direction through a reflector (not shown).<br>
However, including a half-wave voltage doubler circuit, the high voltage transformer 14<br>
rectifies the AC power to a DC through the half-wave voltage doubler circuit and supplies it to the<br>
magnetron 15.<br>
That is, as the high voltage transformer 14 includes the half-wave voltage doubler circuit that<br>
rectifies only a power supply (voltage / current) corresponding to a half of one period of a frequency<br>
of a general AC power, a ripple is generated due to the frequency characteristics of the general AC<br>
power, which causes a flicker phenomenon.<br>
Namely, since the light generated from the electrodeless light bulb 16 flickers due to the<br>
flicker phenomenon, light is not stably radiated.<br>
Consequently, in the high voltage transformer of the lighting system using microwave in<br>
accordance with the conventional art, since the power is supplied to the magnetron through the half-<br>
wave voltage doubler, the ripple takes place due to the frequency characteristics of the general AC<br>
power.<br>
That is, the light generated from the electrodeless light bulb flickers because of the flicker<br>
phenomenon caused due to the ripple.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
A power supply apparatus of a lighting system using microwave that is capable of radiating a<br>
stable light by removing a flicker phenomenon in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 2 through 6A and 6B.<br>
Figure 2 is a drawing illustrating the construction of a lighting system using microwave in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a lighting system using microwave includes : a relay unit 13 for<br>
receiving an AC power, and passing or cutting off the AC power according to a control signal; a<br>
power supply apparatus 100 for transforming the AC power outputted from the relay unit 13 to a high<br>
voltage DC power, increasing a frequency of the current of the DC power, and generating a high<br>
voltage DC power having the increased frequency; a magnetron 15 for receiving the high voltage DC<br>
power from the power supply apparatus 100 and generating microwave; a waveguide (not shown) for<br>
inducing the microwave generated from the magnetron 15; an electrodeless light bulb 16 for<br>
generating light by the induced microwave; a controller 11 for generating a control signal; and a<br>
cooling unit 12 for receiving the power from the relay unit 13 and cooling the heat generated from<br>
the magnetron 15 and the high voltage transformer 14 by themselves.<br>
The power supply apparatus 100 includes ; a high voltage transformer 100-1 for<br>
transforming the AC power outputted from the relay unit 13 into a high<br>
voltage AC power and outputting the transformed AC power; and a voltage<br>
doubler unit 100-2 for transforming the transformed AC power into a high voltage<br>
DC power so that a stable light without a flicker phenomenon can be radiated from<br>
the electrodeless light bulb 16, increasing the frequency of the current of the DC<br>
power up to at least more than twice, and applying the high voltage DC power<br>
having the increased frequency to the magnetron 15.<br>
The operation of the lighting system using microwave will now be<br>
described in detail.<br>
First, the relay unit 13 receives an AC power from an external source and<br>
passes or cuts off the supplied AC power according to a control signal generated<br>
from the controller 11.<br>
The high voltage transformer 100-1 transforms the AC power outputted<br>
from the relay unit 13 into a high voltage AC power and outputs the transformed<br>
AC power to the voltage doubler unit 100-2.<br>
Thereafter, the voltage doubler unit 100-2 transforms the AC power into a<br>
high voltage DC power so that a stable light (the light without a flicker<br>
phenomenon) can be radiated from the electrodeless light bulb 16, increases the<br>
frequency of the current of the DC power up to least more than twice, and supplies<br>
the high voltage DC power having the increased frequency to the magnetron 15.<br>
In this respect, the frequency is preferably increased to 100 Hz ~ 120 Hz.<br>
That is, the voltage doubler unit 100-2 rectifies a current/voltage flowing<br>
for one period of a general frequency transformed by the high voltage transformer<br>
100-1 and increases the frequency to twice.<br>
Accordingly, in order to remove the flicker phenomenon that light radiated<br>
 from the electrodeless light bulb 16 flickers by the density of current generated<br>
from the general frequency, the voltage doubler unit 100-2 increases the<br>
frequency of the current applied to the magnetron 15 up to more than 100 Hz ~<br>
120 Hz.<br>
Thereafter, the magnetron 15 receives the high voltage DC power having<br>
the frequency that has been increased by more than twice from the voltage<br>
doubler unit 100-2 and generates a microwave.<br>
In this respect, the microwave is induced to the electrodeless light bulb 16<br>
through the waveguide. Then, the electrodeless light bulb 16 outwardly generates<br>
a stable light (the light without the flicker phenomenon) by the microwave<br>
generated from the magnetron 15.<br>
The light is forwardly radiated through a reflector (not shown).<br>
That is, as a substance sealed in the electrodeless light bulb 16 is emitted,<br>
a light having an inherent radiation spectrum is generated from the electrodeless<br>
light bulb 16. The light is forwardly reflected by the reflector (not shown) and a<br>
mirror (not shown), lighting a space around it.<br>
The construction of the power supply apparatus 100 in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to<br>
Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 is a drawing illustrating the construction of a power supply<br>
apparatus in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the voltage doubler unit 100-2 of the power supply<br>
apparatus 100 includes a first circuit unit 301 for transforming the high voltage AC<br>
power (voltage/current) transformed by the high voltage transformer 100-1 for one<br>
half of one period of the general frequency into a high voltage DC power; and a<br>
second circuit unit 302 for transforming the high voltage AC power transformed by<br>
the high voltage transformer (HVT) 100-1 for the other half of one period into a<br>
high voltage of DC power.<br>
The first circuit unit 301 includes one side of a first capacitor (C1)<br>
connected to one output terminal of the high voltage transformer 100-1; a '-<br>
' terminal of a first diode (D1) connected to the other side of the first capacitor<br>
(C1); and a '+' terminal of a third diode (D3) connected to the other side of the first<br>
capacitor (C1).<br>
The second circuit unit (302) includes one side of a second capacitor<br>
connected to the output terminal of the other side of the high voltage transformer<br>
(100-1); a '-' terminal of a second diode (D2) connected to the other side of the<br>
second capacitor (C2); and a fourth diode (D4) connected to the other side of the<br>
second capacitor (C2).<br>
Wherein a '+' terminal of the first diode (D1) is connected to a '+' terminal<br>
of the second diode. That is, the voltage doubler unit 100-2 is constructed as a<br>
mirror type on the basis of the ground of the high voltage transformer 100-1, and<br>
operated for a different period.<br>
For example, the first circuit unit 301 is operated for one half of one period<br>
to rectify the power (voltage/current) corresponding to the half of one period, while<br>
the second circuit unit 302 is operated for the other half of one period to rectify the<br>
power corresponding to the other half of one period. Thus, the frequency of the<br>
current (oscillation current) among the DC power characteristics of the high<br>
voltage is increased by twice and applied to the magnetron 15.<br>
That is, in order to remove the flicker phenomenon that the light flickers<br>
due to the density of the current generated by the general frequency (i.e., 50 Hz or<br>
60 Hz), the frequency of the oscillation current of the magnetron 15 is increased<br>
by more than 100 Hz - 120 Hz.<br>
In this respect, the first and the second circuit units are called 'half-wave<br>
voltage doubler rectifying circuits, and the structure including the first and the<br>
second circuit units is called a 'both-wave voltage doubler rectifying circuit'.<br>
Figure 4 is a drawing illustrating the construction of a power supply<br>
apparatus in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the power supply apparatus in accordance with<br>
another embodiment of the present invention includes: a first half-wave voltage<br>
doubler rectifying circuit 401 connected to a filament connected to a core of the<br>
first high voltage transformer (HVT) and the output terminal of the first HVT; a<br>
second HVT connected to the input of the first HVT; and a second half-wave<br>
voltage doupler rectifying circuit 402 connected to the output terminal of the<br>
second HVT.<br>
That is, the power supply apparatus in accordance with the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention is constructed in that the both-wave voltage<br>
doubler circuits (401, 402) are connected to the two HVTs and operated for<br>
different periods.<br>
Likewise in the first embodiment of the present invention, in order to<br>
remove the flicker phenomenon that light flickers due to the density of current<br>
generated by the general frequency (i.e., 50 Hz or 60 Hz, etc.), the frequency of<br>
the oscillation current of the magnetron 15 is increased by more than 100 Hz or<br>
120 Hz.<br>
The operation of the voltage doubler unit (the both-wave voltage doubler<br>
rectifying circuit) will now be described with reference to Figure 5 that showing the<br>
waveforms according to time lapse.<br>
Figure 5 is a drawing illustrating the operations of a voltage doubler unit as<br>
waveforms according to time lapse in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, when the first circuit unit 301 is operated for 'A'<br>
period (a half of one period), the first capacitor (C1) is charged (Vc=Vm), and the<br>
voltage in the 'B' interval is V0 (positive voltage) = Vi - Vc = Vi - Vm.<br>
Accordingly, a minus (-) rectifying voltage can be obtained by using a<br>
capacitance of the third diode (D3) and the magnetron 15 for '0' peak. In this<br>
respect, Vi=Vc and Vo is maintained as '0' potential in the first 'A' interval.<br>
Meanwhile, when the second circuit unit 302 is operated for 'B' period, the<br>
second capacitor (C2) is charged and the voltage in 'A interval is V0=Vi-Vc=Vi-Vm.<br>
That is, a (-) rectifying voltage can be obtained by using the capacity of the<br>
fourth diode (D4) and the magnetron 15 for the '0' peak.<br>
In the first 'B' interval, Vi=Vc and V0 is maintained at '0' potential.<br>
In this respect, Vi is an output voltage value of the HVT, Vc is a value of<br>
voltage flowing at the first capacitor (C1), Vm is a maximum output voltage value<br>
of the HVT, and Vo is a value of voltage flowing at the first and second diodes (D1,<br>
D2).<br>
Accordingly, the high voltage DC power is supplied to the magnetron 15<br>
according to the operations of the first and the second circuit units 301 and 302<br>
according to the repetition of the period of the frequency, and the voltage of the<br>
DC power is maintained the DC rectifying waveform of (-) a few kV.<br>
That is, the frequency of the current (oscillation current) supplied to the<br>
magnetron 15 is transformed by more than twice of the input frequency (general<br>
frequency).<br>
Accordingly, the magnetron 15 radiating the microwave is stably oscillated,<br>
so that the flicker phenomenon of the electrodeless light bulb 16 can be removed.<br>
The waveform of the voltage and the current supplied to the magnetron 15<br>
will now be described with reference to Figures 6A and 6B.<br>
Figures 6A and 6B are drawings showing waveforms of voltage and<br>
current supplied to the magnetron in accordance with the present invention.<br>
That is, Figure 6A shows a waveform of a voltage supplied to an anode of<br>
the magnetron 15 through the first and the second circuit units 301 and 302 of the<br>
voltage doubler unit 100-2, and Figure 6B shows waveforms of a current applied<br>
to the anode of the magnetron 15 through the first and the second circuit units 301<br>
and 302 of the voltage doubler unit 100-2.<br>
As so far described, the power supply apparatus of a lighting system using<br>
microwave has an advantage that, since the frequency of the power applied to the<br>
magnetron is increased to remove the flicker phenomenon, a stable light can be<br>
radiated to an external space.<br>

departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>

5. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the increased frequency is 100 Hz to 120 Hz.<br>
Dated this 22nd day of March 2002.<br>
A power supply apparatus of a lighting system using microwave has : a high voltage<br>
transformer (100-1) for transforming a general AC power to an AC power of high voltage and<br>
outputting the high voltage AC power; and a voltage doubler unit (100-2) for transforming the high<br>
voltage AC power into a high voltage DC power, increasing the frequency of the current of the DC<br>
power, and outputting the DC power having the increased frequency. Since the frequency of the<br>
power applied to the magnetron (15) is increased to remove the flicker phenomenon, a stable light<br>
can be radiated to an external space.</td>
