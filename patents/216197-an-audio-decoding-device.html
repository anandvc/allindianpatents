As shown in FIG.10, a radio communication system lA comprises a plurality of mobile radio stations 2A and base radio stations 3A which relay and connect mutually these mobile radio stations 2A. A audio coding device which codes the input audio and then outputs a transmission signal and a audio decoding device which decodes an incoming received signal and then outputs the audio are built in each of these mobile radio stations 2A and base radio stations 3A.<br>

Then, the audio decoding device which has a function for receiving the transmission signal from the transmission processing means 85 in the audio coding device 8 via the transmission line and then decoding the received signal to output the audio will be explained hereunder.<br>
In the prior art, as such audio decoding device, for example, a device set forth in Patent Application Publication (KOKAI) Hei 4- 100422 has been known. FIG.12 is a block diagram showing a schematic configuration of an interior of the audio decoding device in the prior art.<br>
The audio decoding device 100 shown in FIG.12 comprises a demodulation processing means 101 for receiving the signal, to<br><br>
which the error may be added over the transmission line, as the received signal and then demodulating the received signal into the coded data; an error correction processing means 102 for deciding whether or not the error is added to the coded data, then deciding whether or not the error is correctable if the error is added, then applying an error correction process to the coded data if the error is not added or if the added error is correctable, and then decoding the audio code to generate audio data; a audio decoding means 103 for decoding the audio code to generate the audio data; and a audio output processing means 104 for outputting the audio data which are output from the audio decoding means 103.<br>

However, according to the above audio decoding device in the prior art, in the case that the audio data is generated by decoding the audio code, which is concerned with the coded data containing the uncorrectable error caused due to, for example, aggravating circumstances of the transmission line, as shown in FIG. 13, the audio code which associates with the preceding frame is read from the buffer 106 in unit of frame based on the interpolation process information, in place of decoding of the audio data containing the uncorrectable error (step SlOl), then the audio code is transmitted to the audio decoding means 103 (step S102), then the interpolation process is executed in unit of frame (step S103), and then the audio code is decoded to generate the<br><br>
audio data (step S104). Therefore, there is a problem that distortion or disconnection of the output audio is generated by carrying out the interpolation process in unit of frame.<br>

As a result, while maintaining continuity of a audio waveform in the audio data after the decoding has been completed, generation of distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum by providing the optimum interpolation process which can mate with the current situation of the transmission line.<br>
Therefore, according to the audio decoding device of the second aspect of the present invention, the optimum audio decoding means out of the normal process type audio decoding means, the<br><br>

process type audio decoding means for decoding the audio code to generate the audio data if it is decided by the error correctability deciding means that the error which is added to the audio code is correctable.<br>

Therefore, according to the audio decoding, if it is decided by the interpolation process deciding means that the number of times of the audio decoding process in every frame does not exceed the predetermined number of times, the audio code optimization processing means detects likelihood of respective elements of the audio code being output by the error correction processing means based on the soft decision information, then applies the bit inversion to the low likelihood elements of the audio code, and then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the bit inversion by the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means. Therefore, prior to the audio decoding process in the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means, the audio codes can be estimated as much as possible and also the interpolation process executed by the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means is applied only to the audio<br><br>
codes which cannot be estimated, so that the frequency of the interpolation process can be reduced as small as possible and thus generation of the distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum while maintaining continuity of the audio waveform.<br>

A sound decoding apparatus according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings hereinafter.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
At first/ a sound decoding apparatus according to a first embodiment will be explained hereinbelow. FIG.l is a block diagram showing a schematic configuration of an interior of the audio decoding device according to the first embodiment.<br>
The audio decoding device 1 shown in FIG.l is incorporated into the foregoing radio communication system, and has a function for receiving the transmission signal from the audio coding device incorporated into the radio communication system as the received signal via the transmission line and then decoding the received signal to output the audio.<br>
The audio decoding device 1 shown in FIG.l comprises a reception processing means 11, a demodulation processing means 12, a soft decision information generating means 12a, an error correction processing means 13, a audio decoding processing means 14, and a audio output processing means 15.<br>
The reception processing means 11 receives the signal, which has such a possibility that the error is added on the<br><br>
transmission line, as the received signal from the audio coding device 8.<br>
The demodulation processing means 12 decodes the received signal received by the reception processing means 11 into coded data.<br>
The soft decision information generating means 12a extracts a receiving electric field strength from the coded data, which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, and also extracts phase information of symbol points from the coded data, and then generates soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line, based on the extracted receiving electric field strength and the extracted phase information.<br>
If it is decided that no error is added to the coded data demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, the error correction processing means 13 decodes the coded data to output the audio code. Also, if it is decided that the correctable error is added to the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, the error correction processing means 13 applies the error correction process to the coded data and also decodes the coded data, which is subjected to the error correction process, to output the audio code. In addition, if it is decided that the uncorrectable error is added to the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means<br><br>
12, the error correction processing means 13 decodes the coded data to output the audio code and then outputs interpolation process information based on the coded data.<br>
If the audio decoding processing means 14 receives the audio code associated with the coded data to which no error is added, or the audio code associated with the coded data to which the correctable error is added from the error correction processing means 13, such audio decoding processing means 14 decodes the audio code to output the audio data. Also, if the audio decoding processing means 14 receives the audio code associated with the coded data to which the uncorrectable error is added from the error correction processing means 13 , such audio decoding processing means 14 reads the interpolation information in the preceding frame based on the interpolation process information concerning to the audio code, then applies the interpolation process to the audio code bit by bit based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information, and then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process to generate the audio data.<br>
The audio output processing means 15 outputs the audio data which are generated by the audio decoding processing means 14.<br>
Also, the error correction processing means 13 serves to store/hold the audio code and the coded data frame by frame as<br><br>
the interpolation information when the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12 and to which no error is added is decoded to then output the audio code, or when the error correction process is applied to the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12 and to which the correctable error is added and then the coded data which are subjected to the error correction process are decoded to then output the audio code.<br>
Next, an operation of the audio decoding device 1 according to the first embodiment will be explained hereunder.<br>
When the reception processing means 11 receives the signal which has such a possibility that the error is added on the transmission line as the received signal, it transmits the received signal to the demodulation processing means 12. The demodulation processing means 12 then demodulates the received signal received by the reception processing means 11 into the coded data, and then transmits the coded data to the error correction processing means 13.<br>
The soft decision information generating means 12a generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line, based on the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12.<br>
The soft decision information generating means 12a extracts the receiving electric field strength and the phase<br><br>
information of symbol points from the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, and then generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line while using a level of the receiving electric field strength/ an amount of the phase shift of the symbol points, etc. as parameters. For example, if the level of the receiving electric field strength is low, if the level of the receiving electric field strength is varied, if the amount of the phase shift of the symbol points is increased, or the like, the soft decision information generating means 12a generates the soft decision information indicating that the situation of the transmission line becomes worse.<br>
If it is decided that no error is added to the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, the error correction processing means 13 decodes the coded data to transmit the audio code to the audio decoding processing means 14,<br>
Also, if it is decided that the correctable error is added to the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, the error correction processing means 13 applies the error correction process to the coded data, and then decodes the coded data which are subjected to the error correction process to then transmit the audio code to the audio decoding processing means 14.<br>
Also, if it is decided that the uncorrectable error is added to the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12, the error correction processing means 13 decodes the coded data to output the audio code and also transmits the interpolation process information to the audio decoding processing means 14 based on the coded data.<br>
When the audio decoding processing means 14 receives the audio code associated with the coded data to which no error is added, or the audio code associated with the coded data to which the correctable error is added from the error correction processing means 13, such audio decoding processing means 14 decodes the audio code to generate the audio data, and then transmits such audio data to the audio output processing means 15.<br>
Also, when the audio decoding processing means 14 receives the audio code associated with the coded data to which the uncorrectable error is added from the error correction processing means 13, such audio decoding processing means 14 reads the interpolation information in the preceding frame based on the interpolation process information concerning to the audio code, then applies the interpolation process to the audio code bit by bit based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information, then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process to generate the audio data, and then<br><br>
transmits the audio data to the audio output processing means 15.<br>
The audio output processing means 15 outputs the audio data which are generated by the audio decoding processing means 14,<br>
In other words, according to the audio decoding device, as shown in FIG. 2, the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line is generated by the soft decision information generating means 12a (step Sll). It is decided whether or not the audio code which is concerned with the coded data to which the uncorrectable error is added is received (step S12).<br>
If the audio code which is concerned with the coded data to which the uncorrectable error is added is received, the interpolation information in the preceding frame is read based on the interpolation process information concerning to the audio code (step S13). The interpolation process is applied to the audio code in unit of bit based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information (step S14). The audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process is decoded to generate the audio data (step S15).<br>
While, in step S12, if the audio code which is concerned with the coded data to which the correctable error is added is received, the error correction is executed. Then, the process goes to step SI5.<br><br>
According to the audio decoding device 1 in the first embodiment, there is provided the soft decision information generating means 12a which generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line based on the coded data demodulated by the demodulation processing means 12. Even if the audio code which is concerned with the coded data containing the uncorrectable error caused due to tbe aggravating circumstances of the transmission line is received, the interpolation information in the preceding frame can be read based on the interpolation process information concerning to the audio code, then the interpolation process can be applied to the audio code in unit of bit based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information, and then the audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process can be decoded to generate the audio data. As a result, while maintaining continuity of a audio waveform in the audio data after the decoding has been completed, generation of distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum by providing the optimum interpolation process which can mate with the current situation of the transmission line.<br>

The optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 decodes the audio code to generate the audio data if it is decided by the error correct ability deciding means 54 in the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 that the error added to the audio code is correctable-<br>
The audio decision processing means 72 calculates a correlation value between the audio data generated by the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 and the audio data in the preceding frame stored in the audio information storage buffer 64, then decides whether or not the calculated correlation value is in excess of a threshold value, and then sets the audio data generated by the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 as the audio data generated in the<br><br>

Next, an operation of the audio decoding device 2 according to the second embodiment will be explained hereunder.<br>
First, an overall operation of the audio decoding device 2 will be explained with reference to FIG.3 hereunder.<br>
The reception processing means 21 transmits the received signal to the demodulation processing means 22 when it receives the signal, which has such a possibility that the error is added on the transmission line, as the received signal.<br>
The demodulation processing means 22 demodulates the received signal into coded data, and then transmits the coded data to the error correction processing means 23.<br>
The soft decision information generating means 22a generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line, based on the coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 22.<br>
The error correction processing means 23 decodes the<br><br>
coded data which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 22 to output the audio code, and also outputs the interpolation process information as for the coded data if it is decided that the uncorrectable error is added to the coded data.<br>
The error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 analyzes the error added situation in the audio code which is output from the error correction processing means 23.<br>
The optimization audio decoding processing means 25 selects the optimum audio decoding means 63, 65, or 66 out of the normal process type audio decoding means 63, the optimization process type audio decoding means 65, and the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66 based on the analyzed result obtained by the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24, and then outputs the audio data which are decoded by the selected audio decoding means 63, 65, or 66.<br>
The audio output processing means 26 outputs the audio data which are output from the optimization audio decoding processing means 25.<br>
Then, an operation of the demodulation processing means 22 in the audio decoding device 2 shown in FIG.4 will be explained hereunder.<br>
When the received signal demodulation processing means 32 receives the received signal from the reception processing means 21 via the received signal inputting means 31, such received<br><br>
signal demodulation processing means 32  in the demodulation processing means 22 shown in FIG. 4 demodulates the received signal to generate the coded data, and then transmits the coded data to the coded data outputting means 33-<br>
The soft decision information generation data extracting means 34 in the soft decision information generating means 22a extracts the receiving electric field strength from the coded data which are generated by the received signal demodulation processing means 32 and also extracts the phase information of the symbol points from the coded data, and then transmits the extracted receiving electric field strength and the extracted phase information to the soft decision information calculation processing means 35.<br>
Also, the soft decision information calculation processing means 35 extracts the receiving electric field strength and the phase information at the symbol points from the coded data which are demodulated by the received signal demodulation processing means 32, and then generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line while using a level of the receiving electric field strength, the phase shift at the symbol points, etc. as the parameters. For example, if the level of the receiving electric field strength is low, if the level of the receiving electric field strength is varied, if the amount of the phase shift of the symbol<br><br>
points is increased, or the like, the soft decision information calculation processing means 35 generates the soft decision information indicating that the situation of the transmission line becomes worse.<br>
The soft decision information calculation processing means 35 generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line based on the receiving electric field strength and the phase information, and outputs the soft decision information via the soft decision information outputting means 36.<br>
In this manner, since the receiving electric field strength and the phase information at the symbol points can be extracted from the coded data and then the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line can be generated based on the receiving electric field strength and the phase information, the soft decision information generating means 22a can cope sufficiently with the signal error which is generated due to the aggravating circumstances of the transmission line.<br>
Next, an operation of the error correction processing means 23 in the audio decoding device 2 shown in FIG.5 will be explained hereunder.<br>
If the error correction demodulation processing means 43 in the error correction processing means 23 shown in FIG. 5 receives<br><br>
the coded data from the coded data outputting means 33 in the demodulation processing means 22 via the coded data inputting means 41 and also the soft decision information from the soft decision information outputting means 36 in the demodulation processing means 22 via the soft decision information inputting means 42, such error correction demodulation processing means 43 applies the error correction process to the coded data, which are input from the coded data inputting means 41, bit by bit based on the soft decision information, then decodes the coded data which are subjected to the error correction process to output the audio code, and then transmits the audio code to the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 via the audio code outputting means 44.<br>
The error check bit calculating means 45 checks whether or not the error is added to the audio code which is input from the error correction demodulation processing means 43, and then transmitting the checked result to the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 as the error check bit via the error check bit outputting means 46.<br>
In this fashion, since the error correction process is applied to the coded data, which are demodulated by the demodulation processing means 22, bit by bit based on the soft decision information before the process advances to the optimization audio decoding processing means 25, the error<br><br>
correction demodulation processing means 43 can reduce the frequency of the interpolation process in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25.<br>
Since it is possible to output the error check bit indicating the checked result to show whether or not the error is added to the audio code, the error check bit calculating means 45 can improve a processing efficiency in the succeeding error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 which analyzes the error added situation.<br>
Next, an operation of the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 in the audio decoding device 2 shown in FIG.6 will be explained hereunder.<br>
If the audio code error deciding means 52 in the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 shown in FIG. 6 receives the error check bit from the error check bit outputting means 46 via the error check bit inputting means 51, such audio code error deciding means 52 decides whether or not the error is added to the audio code which is output from the error correction processing means 23, based on the error check bit.<br>
Also, if the audio code error deciding means 52 decides that the error is not added to the audio code, it transmits a selection instruction to select the normal process type audio decoding means 63 in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 to the optimization audio decoding processing means 25.<br><br>
If the audio code error deciding means 52 decides that the error is added to the audio code, the error correctability deciding means 54 decides whether or not the error being added to the audio code is correctable, based on contents of the audio decoding process of the audio decoding means 63, 65, or 66 which is selected by the preceding frame stored in a audio decoding process storage buffer 53.<br>
If the error correctability deciding means 54 decides that the error being added to the audio code is uncorrectable, it transmits a selection instruction to select the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66 in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 to the optimization audio decoding processing means 25.<br>
If the error correctability deciding means 54 decides that the error being added to the audio code is correctable, it transmits a selection instruction to select the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 to the optimization audio decoding processing means 25.<br>
In this way, the audio code error deciding means 52 can decide whether or not the error is added to the audio code being output from the error correction processing means 23, based on the error check bit supplied from the error check bit calculating means 45.<br><br>
Further, since the audio code error deciding means 52 selects the normal process type audio decoding means 63 to execute the normal audio decoding process if it decides that the error is not added to the audio code, the optimum audio decoding process to correspond to the current error added situation can be provided.<br>
The error correctability deciding means 54 can decides whether or not the error being added to the audio code is correctable, based on the contents of the audio decoding process associated with the optimum audio decoding means 63, 65, 66 which is selected by the preceding frame stored in the audio decoding process storage buffer 53.<br>
In addition, since the error correctability deciding means 54 can select the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66 to execute the audio decoding process together with the interpolation process if it decides that the error being added to the audio code is uncorrectable, the optimum audio decoding process to correspond to the current error added situation can be provided.<br>
Further, since the error correctability deciding means 54 can select the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 to execute the audio decoding process together with the optimization process if it decides that the error being added to the audio code is correctable, the optimum audio decoding process to correspond to the current error added situation can be provided.<br><br>
Next., an operation of the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 in the audio decoding device 2 shown in FIG.7 will be explained hereunder.<br>
The audio code inputting means 61 in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 shown in FIG. 7 inputs the audio code from the audio code outputting means 44 in the error correction processing means 23.<br>
If it is decided by the audio code error deciding means 52 that no error is added to the audio code, the normal process type audio decoding means 63 starts it operation. That is, the normal process type audio decoding means 63 decodes the audio code, which is input from the audio code inputting means 61, to generate the audio data, and then transmits the audio data to the audio output processing means 26 via the audio data outputting means 69.<br>
If it is decided by the error correctability deciding means 54 that the error being added to the audio code is uncorrectable, the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66 starts its operation. That is, the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66 reads the audio data and the audio code, which are concerned with the preceding frame stored in the audio information storage buffer 64, as the interpolation information based on the interpolation process relating to the audio code which is input from the audio code inputting means 61,<br><br>
then applies the interpolation process to the audio code, to which the uncorrectable error is added, in unit of bit based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information which is input from the soft decision information inputting means 62, then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process to generate the audio data, and then transmits the audio data to the audio output processing means 26 via the audio data outputting means 69.<br>
If it is decided by the error correctability deciding means 54 that the error being added to the audio code is correctable, the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 starts its operation. That is, the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 applies the optimization process to the audio code, which is input from the audio code inputting means 61, based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information, then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the optimization process to generate the audio data, and then transmits the audio data to the audio output processing means 26 via the audio data outputting means 69.<br>
If the audio data are generated by the normal process type audio decoding means 63, the optimization process type audio decoding means 65, or the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66, the audio decoding process storing means 67 stores sequentially contents of the audio decoding process, which<br><br>
are concerned with the selected audio decoding means 63, 65, 66, into the audio decoding process storage buffer 53 every frame of the audio data.<br>
If the audio data which are generated by the normal process type audio decoding means 63, the optimization process type audio decoding means 65, or the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66, the audio information storing means 68 also stores sequentially the audio data and the audio code into the audio information storage buffer 64.<br>
In this fashion, since the contents of the audio decoding process which is concerned with the selected audio decoding means 63, 65, 66 every frame of the audio data are stored sequentially into the audio decoding process storage buffer 53 when the audio data which is generated by the selected audio decoding means 63, 65, 66 in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 are output, the audio decoding process storing means 67 can recognize by which audio decoding means 63, 65, 66 the audio decoding process is applied frame by frame, and also can use effectively the contents of the audio decoding process in every frame in the succeeding interpolation process.<br>
Since the audio data and the audio code are stored sequentially into the audio information storage buffer 64 every frame when the audio data generated by the selected audio decoding means 63, 65, 66 are output, the audio information storing means<br><br><br>
68 can recognize the audio data and the audio code frame by frame and also can use effectively the audio data and the audio code in every frame in the succeeding interpolation process.<br>
Next, an operation of the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 shown in FIG.8 will be explained hereunder.<br>
The optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 in the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 shown in FIG-8 starts its operation, and thus decodes the audio code to generate the audio data if it is decided by the error correctability deciding means 54 in the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 that the error which is added to the audio code is correctable.<br>
The audio decision processing means 72 calculates the correlation value between the audio data generated by the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 and the audio data in the preceding frame stored in the audio information storage buffer 64, then decides whether or not the calculated correlation value is in excess of a threshold value, then decides the audio data as the audio if the calculated correlation value exceeds the threshold value, then sets the audio data generated by the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 as the audio data generated in the optimization process type audio decoding means 65, and then transmits the audio data to the audio data outputting means 69.<br><br>
Also, the interpolation process deciding means 73 counts sequentially the number of times of the audio decoding process frame by frame by using the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71, decides that the audio data is not the audio if it is decided by the audio decision processing means 72 that the correlation value is not in excess of the threshold value, and then decides whether or not the number of times of the audio decoding process exceeds a predetermined number of times.<br>
If it is decided that the number of times of the audio decoding process in the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 exceeds a predetermined number of times, the interpolation process deciding means 73 starts an operation of the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74 to carry out the interpolation process.<br>
The optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74 applies the interpolation process to the audio code from the audio code inputting means 61 bit by bit based on the soft decision information from the soft decision information inputting means 62 axid the audio code relating to the preceding frame which is stored in the audio information storage buffer 64, then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process to generate the audio data, then sets such audio data as the audio data generated in the optimization process type audio decoding means 65, and then transmits the audio data to the audio data<br><br>
outputting means 69.<br>
If it is decided that the number of times of the audio decoding process in the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 does not exceed a predetermined number of times, the interpolation process deciding means 73 does not execute the interpolation process but starts an operation of the audio code optimization processing means 75 so as to estimate further audio code.<br>
In response to such start of the operation, the audio code optimization processing means 75 detects likelihood of respective elements of the audio code supplied from the audio code inputting means 61 based on the soft decision information, then applies the bit inversion to the low likelihood elements of the audio code, and then transmits the audio code which is subjected to the bit inversion again to the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71.<br>
Then, the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71 codes the audio code which is subjected to the bit inversion to generate the audio data, and then transmits the audio data to the audio decision processing means 72.<br>
If it is decided by the audio decision processing means 72 that the correlation value does not exceed the threshold value, the interpolation process deciding means 73 decides that the audio data is not the audio, then decides that the number of times of<br><br>
the audio decoding process exceeds the predetermined number of times, and then shifts the process to the audio decoding process in the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74 if it is decided that the number of times of the audio decoding process exceeds the predetermined number of times. Therefore, prior to the audio decoding process in the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74, the audio codes can be estimated as much as possible and also the interpolation process executed by the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74 is applied only to the audio codes which cannot be estimated, so that the frequency of the interpolation process can be reduced as small as possible and thus generation of the distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum while maintaining continuity of the audio waveform.<br>
If it is decided by the interpolation process deciding means 73 that the number of times of the audio decoding process in every frame does not exceed the predetermined number of times, the audio code optimization processing means 75 detects likelihood of respective elements of the audio code being output by the error correction processing means 23 based on the soft decision information, then applies the bit inversion to the low likelihood elements of the audio code, and then decodes the audio code which is subjected to the bit inversion by the optimizing<br><br>
normal process type audio decoding means 71. Therefore, prior to the audio decoding process in the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74, the audio codes can be estimated as much as possible and also the interpolation process executed by the optimizing interpolation process type audio decoding means 74 is applied only to the audio codes which cannot be estimated, so that the frequency of the interpolation process can be reduced as small as possible and thus generation of the distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum while maintaining continuity of the audio waveform. According to the second embodiment, there is provided the soft decision information generating means 22a which generates the soft decision information indicating the current situation of the transmission line, based on the coded data being demodulated by the demodulation processing means 22. If the audio code which is concerned with the coded data containing the uncorrectable error is received from the error correction processing means 23, the interpolation process can be applied to the audio code which is output from the error correction processing means 23 in unit of bit based on the interpolation information and the soft decision information, and then the audio code which is subjected to the interpolation process can be decoded to generate the audio data. As a result, while maintaining continuity of a audio waveform in the audio data after the decoding has been completed, generation<br><br>
of distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum by providing the optimum interpolation process which can mate with the current situation of the transmission line.<br>
Also, according to the second embodiment, the optimum audio decoding means 63, 65, 66 out of the normal process type audio decoding means 63, the interpolation process type audio decoding means 66, and the optimization process type audio decoding means 65 in the optimization audio decoding processing means 25 can be selected based on the analyzed result by the error correction processing situation analyzing means 24 which analyzes the error added situation in the audio code which is output from the error correction processing means 23. As a result, the optimum audio decoding process which corresponds to the current error added situation can be provided.<br>
According to the second embodiment, in the optimization process type audio decoding means 65, prior to the interpolation process in the optimizing normal process type audio decoding means 71, the audio code can be estimated based on the soft decision information as much as possible and the interpolation process can be applied only to the audio code which cannot be estimated. As a result, the frequency of the interpolation process can be reduced, the continuity of the audio waveform can be maintained, and generation of the distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum.<br><br>
In this case, in the above embodiments, the audio decoding device 1 (2) is built in base radio stations 3A and mobile radio stations 2A in a radio communication system shown in FIG.10 respectively. However, as shown in FIG.9, the audio decoding device 1 (2) may be similarly applied to transmitting terminals 2B, receiving terminals 3B, and a host 4B.<br>
According to the audio decoding device of the present invention constructed as above, while maintaining continuity of the audio waveform in the audio data after the decoding has been completed, generation of distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum by providing the optimum interpolation process which can mate with the current situation of the transmission line.<br>
Also, according to the audio decoding device of the present invention, the optimum audio decoding process which can correspond to the current error added situation can be provided.<br>
In addition, according to the audio decoding device of the present invention, prior to the interpolation process, the audio codes can be estimated based on the soft decision information as much as possible and also the interpolation process can be applied only to the audio codes which cannot be estimated, so that the frequency of the interpolation process can be reduced as small as possible and thus generation of the distortion and disconnection of the audio can be suppressed to the minimum while<br><br>
maintaining the continuity of the audio waveform.<br><br><br>
