				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL TABLET<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to orally deliverable pharmaceutical dosage forms, more particularly tablets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tablets are the most common and convenient pharmaceutical dosage form for oral administration of medications. It is an important functional attribute of a tablet that it be readily identifiable by appearance, including by size, shape, surface texture, markings and color. Such ready identifiability is important in minimizing dispensing errors and in enabling patients on multiple medication to distinguish among the drugs they take at different times or frequencies. A vast array of drugs are now formulated as tablets, many of these drugs being formulated at different dosage strengths, and it is therefore becoming ever more important, yet ever more difficult to insure, that any new tablet has unique appearance.<br>
In particular, the range of readily distinguishable colors available to the formulator of tablets is rather limited. To some extent this problem has been alleviated by use of particolored, bicolored or multicolored tablets. However, a need remains in the art for tablets having unique surface color patterns.<br>
In the case of coated tablets, color can be an attribute of the surface coating. For example, a range of opaque pigments are available for incorporation in tablet coating compositions such as those based on ethylcellulose; these pigments tend to impart a solid white or colored appearance to a coated tablet. Alternatively, the surface coating can be clear and transparent, and the color of the coated tablet is controlled by the color of the tablet core underlying the coating.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,326,028 to Nivaggioli et al, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a tablet coating comprising gellan gum. Such a coating is said to be useful for tablets to be taken orally, and to confer benefits in appearance, identification, mouth feel, reduced dust, stability, color and/or swallowability.<br>
International Patent Publication No. WO 01/10406, incorporated herein by reference, discloses compositions said to be suitable for a wide range of routes of administration of sildenafil citrate, including buccal and sublignual routes. Preferred<br>
compositions disclosed are said to comprise a solution, gel, semisolid, suspension, metered dose device, transdermal patch or film. It is indicated that such compositions can include a gelling system, for example gellan gum 0.5% to 10%.<br>
International Patent Publication No. WO 02/05820, incorporated herein by reference, discloses film dosage forms comprising sildenafil citrate. These dosage forms are prepared by mixing a solid dispersion of sildenafil citrate and a water-soluble sugar with a hydrocolloid and optionally other ingredients, and are said, upon placement on a mucosal surface, to form a coating that subsequently disintegrates and dissolves to release sildenafil. Gellan sodium salt is listed among hydrocolloids said to be useful in such film dosage forms.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,291,506 to Levin, incorporated herein by reference, discloses that the ophthalmic drug carvedilol can be formulated for ocular administration by suspending it in an agent such as gellan gum that will increase corneal contact time with the drug. Other possible delivery modes for the drug are contemplated therein. A claim is included to a method wherein the drug is delivered by a selection of routes including sublingually.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is now provided a pharmaceutical tablet comprising a core and a coating adherent thereto, wherein (a) the core comprises solid particles of a water-soluble dye distributed in a matrix, and (b) the coating comprises gellan gum.<br>
The tablet is particularly suitable for peroral or intraoral administration, for example for delivery of a drug contained in the core of the tablet to a subject, illustratively a human subject. The term "peroral" herein refers to administration via the mouth involving swallowing of the tablet without substantial prior disintegration of the tablet in the mouth, so that absorption of the drug typically occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. The term "intraoral" herein refers to administration by placement of the tablet in the mouth of the subject, where the tablet disintegrates and/or dissolves, so that absorption of the drug typically occurs at least in part via the oral mucosa. For intraoral administration, the tablet can be placed in or on any part of the mouth, but placement of the tablet in the sublingual or buccal spaces is preferred.<br>
The tablet can alternatively be dissolved or dispersed in a liquid vehicle, preferably water, and swallowed as a draft.<br>
Tablets of the invention have an unusual speckled appearance. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that during the process of coating the core with an aqueous coating composition comprising gellan gum, dye particles in contact with the coating composition partially dissolve, causing color to "bleed" into the coating at the locus of each such particle. The color then becomes fixed as the coating dries. The speckled pattern is accentuated and rendered even more attractive or elegant by a high gloss surface texture contributed by the gellan gum. As described more My hereinbelow, many variants of the speckled pattern characteristic of tablets of the invention are possible and practicable, adding a new option to the formulator seeking to prepare a readily identifiable tablet.<br>
As a further advantage, the speckled pattern of tablets of the invention can obscure any small areas of discoloration that can sometimes result from variation in process conditions.<br>
Other features, advantages and benefits of the invention will be apparent from the description that follows.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A tablet of the invention can be a placebo tablet, i. e., containing no drug or other active agent in the core thereof.

In another embodiment, a drug contained in the core of the tablet is useful in treatment and/or prevention of sexual dysfunction in male and/or female subjects. Such a drug can illustratively be (a) a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil, (b) a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, (c) a cyclic AMP activator, (d) an a-adrenergic antagonist, e.g., phentolamine or yohimbine, or (e) a dopaminergic agonist, e.g., apomorphine. Such a drug can be a compound of formula (V) beloAV. Alternatively, a drug contained in the core of the tablet can be other than a drug useful in treatment and/or prevention of sexual dysfunction. As another alternative, a drug contained in the core of the tablet can be useful in treatment and/or prevention of sexual dysfunction but is other than a compound of formula (V) below.<br>
In illustrative compositions a drug useful for example in treatment of Parkinson's disease or sexual dysfunction is present in the core of the tablet and is a<br><br>
compound of formula (V)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are the same or different and are H, C1-6 alkyl (optionally phenyl substituted), C3-5alkenyl or alkynyl or C3-10 cycloalkyl, or where R3 is as above and R1 and R2 are cyclized with the attached N atom to form pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, mprpholinyl, 4-methylpiperazinyl or imidazolyl groups; X is H, F, Cl, Br, I, OH,C1-6 alkyl or alkoxy, CN, carboxamide, carboxyl or<br>
(C1-6 alkyl)carbonyl; A is CH, CH2, CHF, CHC1, CHBr, CHI, CHCH3, C=O, OS, CSCH3, C=NH,<br>
CNH2, CNHCH3, CNHCOOCH3, CNHCN, SO2 or N; B is CH, CH2, CHF, CHC1, CHBr, CHI, OO, N, NH or NCH3, and n is 0 or<br>
1; and<br>
D is CH, CH2, CHF, CHC1, CHBr, CHI, C=O, O, N, NH or NCH3. It is preferred that the compound of formula (V) or salt thereof is water-soluble. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of formula (V) include without restriction salts of the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, methanesulfonic, phosphoric, nitric, benzoic, citric, tartaric, fumaric and maleic acids, and mono- and dicarboxylic acids of formula CH3-(CH2)n-COOH and HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH where n is 0 to 4, for example malonic acid.<br>
Particularly preferred salts are the hydrochloride salt and the maleate, i.e., (Z)-2-butenedioate, salt.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) and their salts can be prepared by processes known per se, including processes described in patent literature cited herein. However, the present invention is not restricted by the process used to prepare the therapeutic agent. Preferred compounds of formula (V) are those disclosed generically or<br>
specifically in U.S. Patent No. 5,273,975 to Moon et al. Especially preferred compounds are those of formula (VI)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X is O or S, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Tablet cores useful according to the invention can be prepared by any suitable process known in the art. A core according to the invention comprises a matrix wherein are distributed solid particles of a water-soluble dye. Any suitable excipient or excipients can form the matrix. For peroral tablets the matrix typically comprises a diluent or carrier, for example lactose and/or starch, and can further comprise additional excipients such as binders, disintegrants, wetting agents, etc. For intraoral tablets the matrix typically comprises a water-soluble sugar, for example mannitol and/or maltose. If a drug is present in the core, the drug, too, is distributed in the matrix.<br>
The ultimate appearance of the tablet depends in part upon the selection of water-soluble dye and the number and size of the solid particles of the dye. For example, relatively large particles will tend to produce a speckled pattern having larger blocks of color than will be produced by smaller particles; and a relatively large number of particles will tend to produce a speckled pattern where the color covers a greater portion of the tablet surface than will be produced by fewer particles. A more water-soluble dye will tend to produce larger and/or less discrete blocks of color than will be produced by a less water-soluble dye.<br>
Optionally solid particles of more than one water-soluble dye can be present in the core, contributing a bicolored or multicolored speckled appearance to the tablet.<br>
The core is coated with a coating composition comprising gellan gum, as more fully described below. The coating is typically present in an amount representing a weight gain of about 0.1% to about 5%, but greater or lesser amounts can be used if desired. Preferably the gellan gum constitutes about 25% to 100%, more preferably about 50% to 100%, by weight of the coating.<br>
Preferably the coating is an excipient coating. An "excipient coating" herein is a coating consisting, at least at the time 'of application of the coating to the core, only<br>
!•<br>
of excipient materials, i.e., having substantially no drug present therein. It will be understood that during manufacture and storage some migration of a drug substance can potentially occur from the core to the coating of a tablet of the invention, but this is generally minimal. Thus a drug substance, if present in the tablet, is largely confined to the core where it is not commingled with gellan gum.<br>
Any gellan gum can be used in the coating composition, but it is preferred to use a deacylated gellan gum such as that sold under the trademark Kelcogel™. Optionally one or more additional gums and/or biopolymers, for example alginates, can be present in the coating composition.<br>
The coating composition comprises a sprayable vehicle, preferably water, having dissolved or dispersed therein a gellan gum and optionally one or more additional excipients. Preferably the coating composition has a total solids concentration of about 1% to about 10% by weight, and a gellan gum concentration of about 1% to about 5% by weight.<br>
Additional excipients present in the coating composition can include one or more buffering agents, typically at a concentration of about 0.03% to about 3% by weight; one or more plasticizers, typically at a concentration of about 0.03% to about 3% by weight; and/or one or more dispersing and/or emulsifying agents, typically at a concentration of about 0.03% to about 3% by weight. An example of a suitable buffering agent is sodium citrate. An example of a suitable plasticizer is propylene glycol. An example of a suitable dispersing or emulsifying agent is lecithin. Flavoring agents can also be included in the coating composition if desired.<br>
The coating composition can be prepared by any suitable process involving dissolving the gellan gum and other, optional, excipients in the vehicle, preferably water. Order of addition is not critical. The water is preferably heated, for example to a temperature of about 55°C to about 85°C. Gellan gum and other excipients, if present, are added with stirring until all ingredients are homogeneously dispersed. The resulting coating liquid is preferably maintained at an elevated temperature during the stirring and subsequent spraying procedure.<br>
Tablet cores to be coated are placed in a suitable coating apparatus, for<br>
example a coating pan, and are preferably preheated to a bed temperature of about 50°C to about 70°C. The coating liquid is sprayed on to the tablets under conditions that will be readily optimized by one of skill in the art.. Spraying is continued until an amount of coating solution equivalent to a weight gain of about 0.1% to about 5% has been applied, The resulting coated tablets are preferably cooled to ambient temperature, or about 20°C to about 35°C, prior to discharge from the coating pan.<br>
Coating and cooling conditions can also affect the precise color pattern of the finished tablet. For example, if coating is done at lower temperatures and/or if cooling occurs slowly, so that the solid dye particles in the core are exposed to water for a longer period of time, a speckled pattern with larger blocks of color will typically result.<br>
