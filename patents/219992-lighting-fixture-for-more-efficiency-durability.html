The present invention relates to LIGHTING FIXTURE FOR MORE EFFICIENCY &amp; DURABILITY in particular to a lighting apparatuses for street lighting purpose. The invention maybe considered to be in the field of energy efficient lighting for street lighting with T5 florescent lamps or LED lamps, but not limited thereto.<br>
Fluorescent luminaries have become increasingly popular in recent years for use in street lighting as they have a comparatively low brightness or glare when related to convention small source luminaries, such as mercury vapor lamps and incandescent lamps. Till now HID (HPSV, HPMV or MH-i.e. Sodium, mercury or metal halide lamps or ordinary tube lights have been used for street lighting. These conventional lamps consume lot of energy. As the lux level is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, lux level is highest, just below the poles &amp; the lowest near the centre between two poles. See Fig.l, Due to this high lux gradient lot of light falls just below the lamp post, which is redundant whereas very little light reaches towards the road area between the poles.<br>
In conventional fixtures, presently available in the market, cover of acrylic toughened glass or poly carbonate is being used to cover the lamps, but many disadvantages are attached with this type of cover, such as diminished light, creaking of cover &amp; dust collecting within the cover which creates an ugly look.<br>
Firstly, it substitutes conventional cover to protect the lamp from stone throwing and also the problem of such cover darkening or cracking after a period of time &amp; dust and insects collecting inside the cover, does not arise electronic ballast incorporated in lighting fixtures that are available in that market are safe against voltage of maximum 300 VAC only, these ballasts<br><br>
are likely to be damaged in a short time, due to voltage spikes or neutral fault condition since voltage across the supply terminals of the ballast can reach upto 415 VAC during such fault condition.<br>
To overcome such limitation, the present invention lighting fixture for more efficiency &amp; durability is preferably using T5 &amp; T5HO lighting in street lights with 14/28W x multiples of two ( Pair lamps of T5) or 24/54W x multiples of two ( Pair lamps of T5HO) or LED multiple lamps save more than 50% energy as compared to HID lamps with equal light output.<br>
The present invention is described with specific and greater clarity with reference to following drawings:<br>
Fig. 1	Conventional lighting effect<br>
Fig. 2	the present invented lighting effect.<br>
Fig. 3.1	represents the top cover of the lighting fixtures<br>
Fig. 3.2	represents the housing for ballast and end connections<br>
Fig. 3.3	represents the housing with Two T5 tubes or multiple tubes<br>
Fig. 4	represents the fill fitting including louvers to cover tubes<br>
Fig. 5	represents the circuit diagram of electronic ballast for newly<br>
invented T5 fixture.<br>
Fig.6	represents  the  cross  sectional  view  of present invented<br>
lighting fixtures. As shown in Fig.l and Fig.2 comparison between the light output of conventional street lighting device and the present invention street light device is provided.<br>
Pairs of different reflectors (4) are used with two or multiple or more lamps (5) in a single fixture (1). The said fixture (1) has a v-shaped projection (2)<br><br>
at the center along the longitudinal axis, in such a way that the reflector (4) directs the light away from the pole at preferably at 35 to 60 degree angles to the pole. Half the number of reflector (4) direct light of their components away from the pole, along the road on one side &amp; the other reflectors directs light of the other lamp, away from the pole, along the road on the other side, as shown by the arrows in the Fig.2. Fig. 2 show that the maximum light is directed towards the center between two poles, the lux gradient will not be as high as that in conventional fixture, resulting in better uniformity and visibility, all along the road. The same principle which gives uniform lighting can also be used for indoor lighting to reduce the number of fixtures (1), as compared to conventional fixtures.<br>
Fig. 3.3 shows the positioning of the pairs of tubes (lamps) (5) along the separate reflectors (4) &amp; separate housing (3) as shown in Fig. 3.2. Fig. 3.3. shows that how they can assemble in the top aluminum cover(l) shown in Fig. 3.1. The separate housing (3) are mounted on the V shaped projection. This shows how the reflectors direct maximum light at 35 degree to 60 degree i.e. away from the street light pole. The maximum length of road can also be covered by arranging the position of lamps /reflectors &amp; housing in the 35 degree to 60 degree direction by hinges or in any other way. This results in uniform light all along the distance between two lamp posts. The louvers (8) as shown in Fig. 4 are parallel to the road direction so, that maximum light is directed along the length of the road ( X direction ) and not wasted on the two sides of the road ( Y direction) as shown in Fig. 2, which saves energy, whereas in conventional lighting fixture light is spread in all the directions and hence wastage of energy occurs. The louvers(8) are also fabricated in such a manner that any mechanical shock occurring on the fixture(l), will be absorbed by the main body thus protects the lamps(5).<br><br><br>
Electronic ballast circuit (7) as shown in fig. 5 provided in the said housing (3) for withstanding upto 415 V AC voltage, high voltage spikes &amp; neutral fault condition. Electronic ballast circuit (7) for this fixture(l) is connected in such a way that it can withstand even 415 VAC and hence the fixture is also electronically safe against neutral fault &amp; large voltage spikes. The circuit diagram shows the durability against 415V. The transistors Tl &amp; T2 are of 700V capacity or more. The LC circuit with LI as 5.5 micro Henry &amp; CI as 47nfX2 type or 0.1 micro farad X2 type, act as the spike suppressors. The toroid of about 10mm diameter wounded by coils Tol, T02 and T03 is used to drive the ballast transistors and to provide reverse feedback, which oppose its own signal to drive the transistors. It has three winding of three or four turns each, which brings about a perfect balance. Two electrolytic capacitors C2 &amp; C3 are of minimum 22/250 volt capacity &amp; together they form a capacity upto 500 Volts. Diodes D1 and D2 are connected in reverse polarity across the transistor to prevent damage from negative spikes. The method used in the electronic circuit as described above, collectively, collectively forms the strength of the electronic ballast and helps it to withstand 415 VAC. The primary object of this invention is to provide improved light fixture which gives more light/ optimum utilization of light, thereby saving energy consumption, saving of cost and reducing number of required fixture for street light or for indoor use, which is environmentally beneficial, durable &amp; maintenance free for long period.<br>
Lighting fixture for more efficiency &amp; durability directs maximum light toward the center between two fixtures at 35 degree to 60 degree on both sides of the pole for uniformity of light, for indoor or street lighting purpose. Louvers (8) spread the light along the length of the road and blocks wastage of light on the two sides of the road. Because of the louvers, the lamps are protected from mechanical shocks<br><br><br>
on the fixture. Electronic ballast incorporated in the fixture is such that to withstands upto 415 VAC to withstand High voltage spikers &amp; also neutral fault condition.<br>
It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments in the examples given above. Summary of the Invention:<br>
