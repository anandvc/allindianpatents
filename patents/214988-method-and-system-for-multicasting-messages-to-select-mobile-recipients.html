				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MULTICASTING<br>
MESSAGES TO SELECT MOBILE RECIPIENTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to telecommunications and, more particularly, to a<br>
method and system for broadcasting or multicasting a message to a specific group of mobile<br>
stations in a cellular wireless communications system.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
The advent of wireless telecommunications, such as cellular telephony, has extended<br>
the functionality available to wireless users: Just as a user can operate a cellular telephone<br>
or other mobile station (MS) to place a voice call to virtually any telephone number, a user<br>
can also operate a suitably equipped MS (such as, for example, a web-enabled wireless<br>
telephone) to place a data call to virtually any remote computer. Once such a connection is<br>
established, a remote computer can send data to the MS, much as a remote computer might<br>
send data to any personal computer connected to the Internet.<br>
In a typical cellular radio communications system (i.e., a wireless<br>
telecommunications network), an area is divided geographically into a number of cell<br>
sectors, each defined by a radio frequency (RF) radiation pattern or air interface from a<br>
respective base transceiver station (BTS) antenna. A number of MSs (such as cellular<br>
telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and/or other devices) may operate<br>
concurrently in a given cell sector, all communicating via the air interface with a common<br>
BTS. In turn, the BTSs from a number of cell sectors may communicate concurrently with a<br>
common base station controller (BSC), which may function to aggregate and control traffic<br>
for the multiple BTSs. A number of BSCs may then communicate concurrently with a<br>
common gateway, such as a packet data serving node (PDSN) or mobile switching center<br>
(MSC), which may function to set up and connect communications to or from other entities.<br>
The BTS, BSC and gateway, in combination, comprise a radio network that provides<br>
network connectivity for an MS.<br>
Generally, a user"s MS is allocated a dedicated channel over which data may be sent<br>
and received. However, there are a number of specialized services that multiple wireless<br>
customers may find desirable. Examples of services that may be sent to multiple users<br>
could include:<br>
• Location-based advertising;<br>
• Vertical services, maintenance, and administrative messages<br>
• Public information services, such as sports scores, traffic conditions, weather<br>
alerts, etc.;<br>
• Video clips of newsworthy events; and<br>
• Audio and video streaming.<br>
In some specialized services, a number of MSs in a cell sector (or even all customers<br>
in the cell sector) would receive the same message. This does not present much of a<br>
problem when only a few users are to receive the data, but can tax a network"s capacity as<br>
more users receive the same message. One resource that can be taxed is the air interface.<br>
The air interface between MSs and the radio network is a scarce resource, and its use should<br>
be conserved whenever possible. In addition, as high-bandwidth applications become more<br>
commonplace, the capacity between other entities and links in wireless communications<br>
networks may also be taxed. As an example, if a BTS is to support a number of concurrent<br>
high-bandwidth communications with multiple MSs, the link between the BTS and the BSC<br>
must support all of that traffic at once.<br>
The link between a BTS and BSC, though, is typically a transmission line with a<br>
finite bandwidth. Similarly, the link between the BSC and a gateway such as a PDSN or<br>
MSC is typically a transmission line with finite bandwidth. Of course, it is possible to<br>
increase traffic capacity between various network elements by simply adding more<br>
transmission lines. Adding transmission lines, though, can be very expensive, since it<br>
requires a provider to either physically add the lines, or to lease additional lines from a local<br>
exchange carrier (LEC). Leasing lines from LECs to increase the traffic capacity between<br>
network elements can, in fact, be a significant portion of a cellular provider"s total operating<br>
cost.<br>
Thus, when a particular message (especially, but not necessarily, one requiring a<br>
significant amount of available bandwidth) is to be sent to a relatively large number of MSs<br>
within a cell sector (or to multiple cell sectors), a system for transmitting the message that<br>
conserves the cellular system"s bandwidth is a significant improvement over a multicast<br>
system that transmits messages to cell sectors indiscriminately. Moreover, it would also be<br>
desirable to control which users have access to specialized services so that users who want<br>
such services can be required to pay for them, and also so that users who do not want the<br>
services are not bothered by unwanted messages.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to an improved mechanism for transmitting data to<br>
multiple MSs in a cellular wireless communication network. The invention generally does<br>
this by (i) maintaining in a network entity a record of which MSs are in a given multicast<br>
group, (ii) maintaining in a network entity a record of which sectors are currently serving<br>
one or more members of the multicast group (which can be referred to as "sectors of<br>
interest"), (iii) providing each such MS with a key to facilitate receipt of a multicast or<br>
broadcast message, and (iv) multicasting or broadcasting the message to only the sectors of<br>
interest. Various network arrangements and processes can be employed to carry out these<br>
functions.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, each message that is to be sent can be an IP message,<br>
sent over a PPP channel to a 3G MS. The PPP channel could be established between a<br>
PDSN and the 3G MS. In this regard, the basic network architecture can include multiple<br>
BTSs coupled to a BSC. The BSC may then be coupled to the PDSN, which in turn is<br>
coupled to a packet-switched network such as the Internet. (The BSC may also be<br>
conventionally coupled to an MSC, which provides circuit-switched connectivity with the<br>
public-switched telephone network (PSTN) as well).<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, to achieve the functions described above, the basic<br>
architecture of a cellular communications network can be modified to include the following:<br>
(a) a Radio Network Multicast Server (RNMS) communicatively coupled with, or integrated<br>
into, the BSC, (b) a Multicast Session Manager (MSM) communicatively coupled with the<br>
PDSN, (c) a Multicast Application Server (MAS) communicatively coupled with the PDSN;<br>
and (d) an MS client, for filtering (for example, at the radio link layer) incoming messages<br>
on a broadcast channel, so that higher levels of the protocol stack receive a given broadcast<br>
message only if the filter allows it. In the exemplary embodiment, valuable network<br>
resources can be conserved by transmitting multicast or broadcast messages only to BTSs<br>
that serve cell sectors with MSs of the multicast groups present in those cell sectors. For<br>
example, if MSs authorized to receive a particular multicast service are present in a first cell<br>
sector, but no such MSs are present in a second cell sector, the message will only be sent to<br>
the first cell sector. Thus, all of the entities and communication links between at least the<br>
BSC and the BTS of the second cell sector will not experience any increase in traffic due to<br>
the messages sent to MSs in the first cell sector.<br>
These as well as other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description,<br>
with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method comprising the steps<br>
of: maintaining, in a first network entity, a first record of multicast addresses, the<br>
first record comprising at least one multicast address ; maintaining, in a second<br>
network entity, a second record of cell sectors that are currently serving one or<br>
more mobile stations that are associated with at least one multicast address in the<br>
first record ; and transmitting at least one multicast message to the cell sectors<br>
that are included in the second record ; whereby the at least one multicast<br>
message is transmitted from each cell sector included in the second record to<br>
mobile stations within those cell sectors.<br>
The present invention also provides in a network of the type comprising a<br>
packet-switched network and a radio network having multiple cell sectors serving<br>
mobile stations, a method comprising the steps of : maintaining, in a network<br>
entity, a first record of multicast addresses, the first record comprising at least one<br>
multicast address ; maintaining, in a network entity, a second record of cell sectors<br>
that are currently serving one or more mobile stations that are associated with at<br>
least one multicast address in the first record ; updating the second record as the<br>
one or more mobile stations move into and out of cell sectors ; and transmitting at<br>
least one IP multicast message to only the cell sectors that are included in the<br>
second record.<br>
The present invention further provides a communications device for use in<br>
a communications network of the type comprising a radio network that has at least<br>
one cell sector that serves mobile stations, the device comprising : a processor; a<br>
memory ; at least one multicast address stored in the memory ; at least one cell<br>
sector identifier stored in the memory, the at least one cell sector identifier<br>
corresponding to a multicast address stored in the memory ; and a set of logic<br>
stored in the memory and executable by the processor to cause the device to<br>
forward multicast packets having a multicast address that is the same as a stored<br>
muticast address to each cell sector that is identified by a cell sector identifier that<br>
corresponds to the stored multicast address.<br>
The present invention still further provides a radio network multicast server,<br>
comprising : a processor; a memory ; the at least one multicast address stored in<br>
the memory ; at least one cell sector identifier stored in the memory, the at least<br>
one cell sector identifier corresponding to a multicast address stored in the<br>
memory ; a set of logic stored in the memory and executable by the processor to<br>
cause the radio network multicast server to forward multicast packets having a<br>
multicast address that is the same as a<br>
stored muticast address to each cell sector that is identified by a cell sector<br>
identifier that corresponds to the stored multicast address ; a network interface ;<br>
and a set of logic stored in the memory and executable by the processor to cause<br>
the radio network multicast server to communicate with other entities via the<br>
network interface and to responsively update the at least one multicast address<br>
stored in the memory and to responsively update any cell sector identifiers stored<br>
in the memory that correspond to the at least one multicast address ; wherein the<br>
radio network multicast server transmits messages to cell sectors according to the<br>
cell sector identifiers stored in the memory.<br>
The present invention still further provides a wireless multicast system of the<br>
type comprising a radio access network and a packet-switched network, the<br>
system comprising : a radio network multicast server, the radio network multicast<br>
server having a first record of multicast addresses, the first record comprising at<br>
least one multicast address ; the radio network multicast server having a second<br>
record of cell sectors that are currently serving one or more mobile stations that<br>
are associated with the at least one multicast address in the first record, the<br>
second record linking cell sectors to specific multicast addresses in the first<br>
record ; and the at least one mobile station that is served by a cell sector that is<br>
included in a second record in the radio network multicast server; wherein at least<br>
one multicast message is transmitted to the at least one mobile station in<br>
accordance with the first record and the second record.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF<br>
AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferring to the drawings, Fig. 1 is a generalized block diagram of a communication<br>
network 10 suitable for communications between one or more MSs and various network<br>
entities. As shown in Fig. 1, the network 10 may include a radio network that comprises<br>
various network entities, such as: base transceiver stations (BTSs) 20, 22, and 24; radio<br>
network multicast router/server (RNMS) 26; base station controller (BSC) 28; and packet<br>
data serving node (PDSN) 30, such as a CommWorks® Total Control® 2000 or the like. In<br>
addition, BSC 28 may be coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC) such as MSC 40, as<br>
in conventional cellular networks. Because BTSs 20, 22, 24, BSC 28, PDSN 30, and MSC<br>
40 can be conventional components of a radio network, they are not described in detail here.<br>
PDSN 30 serves as an interface between the radio network and a packet-switched<br>
network such as packet-switched network 36 (which may be the Internet). In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, a multicast application server (MAS) such as MAS 38, an authentication,<br>
authorization, accounting (AAA) server such as AAA server 34, and a multicast session<br>
manager such as MSM 32 may be communicatively coupled to packet-switched network 36<br>
(and thus ultimately to the radio network via PDSN 30). It should be noted that MSM 32,<br>
AAA server 34, and MAS 38 are functional entities, and any or all of the functions<br>
performed by these entities could be integrated into a single entity (or other, multiple<br>
entities that perform one or more of the functions in combination). Furthermore, any or all<br>
of MSM 32, AAA server 34, and MAS 38 could be directly coupled rather than via<br>
packet-switched network 36.<br>
For clarity only, multiple network entities, such as RNMSs, PDSNs, BSCs, MSMs,<br>
and MASs have been omitted from the drawings, although a network in which the invention<br>
may be implemented could include more than one RNMS, PDSN, BSC, MSM, and MAS.<br>
MAS 38 may generally store and periodically transmit a range of multicast content<br>
for reception by MSs that belong to a multicast group, each multicast being associated with<br>
a particular IP multicast address. MAS 38 may be a server on the IP core network (i.e., the<br>
Internet). In the exemplary embodiment, MAS 38 may not be co-located with a particular<br>
RNMS, although it could be. Instead, MAS 38 would be regionally placed and could thus<br>
be more readily accessed by multiple RNMSs via conventional network routers (not shown)<br>
within packet-switched network 36.<br>
MSM 32 can provide, upon request from MSs, keys, filters, or masks needed by MSs<br>
to enable them to receive multicasts. MSM 32 may be in communication with AAA server<br>
34 and can thus verify that any mobile station requesting to join a multicast group is<br>
authorized to join the group by communicating with AAA server 34<br>
RNMS 26 may access a record or records that correlate radio network cell sectors of<br>
interest with particular multicast addresses. RNMS 26 signals the packet-switched network<br>
to receive multicast data packets sent from MAS 38 that have multicast addresses that<br>
correspond to sectors of interest, as indicated by the record or records. Upon receipt of such<br>
multicast packets, RNMS 26 may forward copies of the multicast packets to sectors of<br>
interest.<br>
AAA server 34 may be a conventional component as described for a third-generation<br>
wireless system in ITU IMT-2000 requirements document Q.I701. AAA server 34<br>
generally maintains account and authorization information as well as user profiles for MSs<br>
served by the radio network. For example, AAA server 34 could maintain a record of<br>
which, if any, multicasts an MS is authorized to receive, as well as for how long. Thus, if a<br>
user wished to terminate a multicast service at the end of a given billing period, AAA server<br>
34 could update its record at the end of the period and the MS"s request for multicasts<br>
beyond the billing period would not be authorized.<br>
MSs 12, 14, 16, and 18 may access the packet-switched network 36 or another<br>
network, such as the PSTN (not shown), via the radio network. In operation, an MS may<br>
send, via a BTS or BSC, a "join" message to RNMS 26, indicating a request to join a<br>
particular multicast group. The join message may be an IP message transmitted via a<br>
common channel in the radio network. When a BTS or BSC receives such a join message,<br>
the BTS or BSC may programmatically add to the IP message an indication of the MS"s<br>
current cell sector; the join message may then be forwarded to RNMS 26. As MSs join a<br>
given multicast group, RNMS 26 could thus get an indication of which cell sectors currently<br>
serve those MSs. RNMS 26 can maintain this information in the form of a database table<br>
that lists, for each multicast group, the cell sectors currently serving MSs that are in the<br>
multicast group. RNMS 26 could be updated in real time (described in detail below) as<br>
multicast group MSs move through the network, ensuring efficient use of the radio network.<br>
The connections of all the entities shown in Fig. 1 are logical rather than physical; as<br>
just one example, RNMS 26 could be physically connected between BSC 28 and PDSN 30<br>
without affecting the functionality of the present invention.<br>
Within network 10, multiple communications devices, such as MSs 12, 14, 16,<br>
(wireless telephones) and 18 (a web-enabled PDA), may be communicatively coupled with<br>
BTS 20, 22, and 24 as shown. Although MSs 12, 14, and 16 are illustrated as wireless<br>
telephones, they may take any suitable form, such as (without limitation) wireless modems,<br>
wireless PDAs (like MS 18), or two-way pagers. MSs 12-18 may communicate with BTS<br>
20-24 using an air interface as set forth in TIA/EIA/IS-2000. Further, MSs 12-18 could be<br>
part of a cellular system that uses another technology, such as AMPS, TDMA, DECT,<br>
GSM, PCS, or PWT; the cellular technology used is not necessarily critical to all<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Although MSs 12-18 are capable of normal voice<br>
communications via BSC 28 and MSC 40, this description will focus primarily on data<br>
communications using the network entities of network 10.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, MSs could join multicast groups as follows. A user<br>
with an MS, such as MS 12, might initiate a request to receive a multicast by, for example,<br>
turning on the MS or selecting a menu item on the MS"s display. The request may include<br>
an option service code or other indicator that indicates packet-data. The request could first<br>
be forwarded from BSC 28 to MSC 40. MSC 40 may detect the option service code (or<br>
otherwise detect a data call) and responsively signal BSC 28 to send the message to PDSN<br>
30 (rather than to MSC 40 as in a voice call). A PPP session could then be established<br>
between MS 12 and PDSN 30.<br>
Next, a client (i.e., a set of software instructions) on MS 12 could set up a data<br>
communication session with MSM 32 via BTS 20, BSC 28, PDSN 30 and packet-switched<br>
network 36. MSM 32 could then authorize the user for access to private (or other) group<br>
multicasts, and transmit (using TCP/IP or a standard internet key exchange protocol, for<br>
example) a key or filtering mask to MS 12 during the data communication session to enable<br>
MS 12 to receive multicast or broadcast packets. MSM 32 could implement the<br>
authorization process by communicating with a registrar, such as AAA server 34, which<br>
may maintain records of which users are authorized to receive multicasts, among other<br>
records (e.g., subscriber profiles). MS registration could also occur with other types of<br>
registrars, such as a home location register or a service agent (not shown). As an alternative<br>
to "on-the-fly" MS registration, an MS could be pre-provisioned by a service provider-that<br>
is, the MS could have a key or mask installed at a facility rather than over a communication<br>
channel.<br>
Multicast messages may originate as follows. Periodically, or based on triggers from<br>
other network entities or MSs, MAS 38 may transmit multicast content to a conventional<br>
router (not shown) within packet-switched network 36. As an illustration, assume that only<br>
MS 12 and MS 18 are authorized to receive private group multicasts with a particular<br>
multicast address. RNMS 26 could receive the multicast content transmitted from MAS 38<br>
via packet-switched network 36. When RNMS 26 receives an IP multicast packet from<br>
packet-switched network 36, it may send duplicates of the packet to each cell sector that is<br>
bound to the particular IP multicast address, as indicated in a database table, in this case, the<br>
cell sectors serving MS 12 and MS 18. Thus, multicast packets may be sent from BSC 28 to<br>
BTS 20 and BTS 24 (and received by MS 12 and 18, within those sectors), but none are sent<br>
from BSC 28 to BTS 22, because BTS 22 is not serving any multicast group members.<br>
A simplified block diagram of RNMS 26 is shown in Fig. 2. The exemplary<br>
embodiment of RNMS 26 shown in Fig. 2 may have a processor 44 (e.g., an integrated<br>
circuit microprocessor), a memory 46 (e.g., memory module, ROM, RAM, flash memory,<br>
hard disk), a radio network data link interface 48, and a packet-switched network interface<br>
42, all of which may or may not be interconnected by a system bus. Memory 46 may<br>
include more than one physical element, such as built-in ROM, RAM, a hard disk, an<br>
optical drive, a removable memory device, etc., and may also include as stored content: one<br>
or more multicast addresses, one or more cell sector identifiers; a set of stored logic by (e.g.,<br>
computer instructions) executable by processor 44 to accept inputs via radio network data<br>
link interface 48 to update the information stored in memory 46 and to carry out various<br>
other functions described herein. The multicast addresses and cell sector identifiers may or<br>
may not be stored in the form of a database table, where each multicast address has one or<br>
more cell sector identifiers associated with it in the table. Provided with the present<br>
disclosure, those skilled in the art can readily prepare appropriate computer instructions to<br>
perform the functions described herein.<br>
The radio network data link interface 48 may include input and output ports and<br>
individual links for each cell sector associated with RNMS 26. The individual links may be<br>
either logical or physical.<br>
RNMS 26 may send multicast routing control packets to PDSN 30 and to packet-<br>
switched network 36 via packet-switched network interface 42. The multicast routing<br>
control packets may then be received by MAS 38, in order to establish multicast paths from<br>
MAS 38 to RNMS 26 via packet switched network 36 and PDSN 30. RNMS 26 may then<br>
receive (at packet-switched network interface 42) IP multicast packets transmitted from<br>
MAS 38. The packet-switched network interface 42 may also be connected directly to the<br>
packet-switched network, bypassing PDSN 30.<br>
The particular configuration shown in Fig. 2 is not necessarily critical to the<br>
functioning of all embodiments of the present invention. For example, a device without a ,<br>
system bus that has a memory and processor contained in one integrated circuit could be <br>
used instead of a separate processor and memory.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, a functional block diagram of an exemplary MS, such as<br>
MS 12 or MS 18, is shown. As illustrated, the MS may include a processor 50, memory 52,<br>
a wireless communications interface 54, and a local communications interface 56, all of<br>
which may be coupled together via a system bus 58. Each of these functional components<br>
may take any of a variety of forms.<br>
Memory 52, for instance, may include a set of machine language instructions<br>
executable by processor 50 to carry out various functions described herein. (Alternatively<br>
or additionally, the MS can embody various combinations of hardware, firmware and/or<br>
software to carry out the functions described). Further, memory 52 may include other<br>
elements, such as a multicast client that processes IP multicast or broadcast data and<br>
presents it to a user. Memory 52 may comprise one or more volatile or non-volatile<br>
elements, such as flash memory, optical memory, or magnetic storage.<br>
Wireless communications interface 54 may establish communications with the radio<br>
network via an air interface. As such, wireless interface 54 may comprise software logic<br>
(e.g., CDMA encoding logic) and/or may comprise a transceiver suitable for interfacing<br>
between processor 50 and a radio frequency antenna (not shown).<br>
For use in an alternative exemplary embodiment, local interface 56 may function as<br>
a port for sending and receiving communications with a service provider"s computer (not<br>
shown). Local interface 56 may comprise a conventional pin-out port, an infrared port, an<br>
Ethernet (RJ-45) port, or any other suitable interface. Software keys, masks, or filters that<br>
enable the MS to receive and process multicast messages may be installed in the MS via<br>
local interface 56.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the MS may be at least a 3G (or, more generally, a<br>
broadband) MS. A 3G MS has the capability of establishing, maintaining, and terminating<br>
packet data sessions with PDSNs. An MS that is less than a 3G MS could also be used in<br>
the exemplary embodiment, although data throughput may be lower.<br>
Figure 3a illustrates a mobile IP protocol reference model that may be used with the<br>
exemplary MS to communicate with the PDSN 30. A similar protocol model could be used<br>
by the exemplary MS to communicate with the RNMS 26, except the PPP layer might not<br>
be used or may be replaced with a multicast data link layer protocol specific to the radio<br>
network used. As described, the exemplary MS may have a client or another component<br>
that enables it to establish, maintain, and terminate a PPP session with PDSN 30; the client<br>
may also enable the MS to receive (via the PDSN 30) and store a transmitted key or mask<br>
that allows the MS to receive and process multicast and/or broadcast data sent to it via<br>
RNMS 26. Specifically, a transmitted "key" could activate a process in the MS to cause it<br>
to recognize, at the MS"s IP layer, datagrams with a particular multicast address. In such an<br>
implementation, the MS may have a fixed, relatively small number of multicast addresses<br>
that it may selectively listen for based on keys it may receive. Once activated to listen for<br>
certain multicast packets, multicast packets with the particular multicast address could be<br>
received by the client in the MS (i.e., the packets could be passed up the protocol stack to<br>
the client for further processing). In MSs that have not received a key, multicast packets<br>
could simply be discarded at the IP layer.<br>
The application of a key or mask to pass authorized multicast data to the MS<br>
application may alternatively be performed at the data link protocol layer instead of at the IP<br>
protocol layer. In order for the radio network to transmit a multicast packet from the RNMS<br>
26 to the MS, the radio network may require the use of a multicast group identifier at the<br>
data link layer. In that case, this multicast link layer identifier could be used instead of the<br>
multicast IP address in the filtering mechanism. Each IP multicast group address could have<br>
a corresponding link layer identifier, with each determinable from the other based on a<br>
simple translation algorithm.<br>
As an alternative to pre-configured multicast addresses, a multicast address could be<br>
transmitted to, and stored in, the MS as a result of a registration and authorization from a<br>
network entity such as MSM 32 or AAA server 34. Once a multicast address is stored in the<br>
MS, the filtering of messages could proceed as described above. As yet another alternative<br>
to software filtering, multicast or broadcast packets could be filtered by a hardware device<br>
(such as a digital signal processor, or DSP) in the MS. As is known to skilled persons, such<br>
filtering can be performed at various different protocol layers; thus, filtering techniques<br>
other than those described here could also be implemented in the exemplary embodiment.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates generally a set of functions that may be involved in an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. At step 60, MSs, such as MS 12 and MS 18 may<br>
request authorization to participate in a particular multicast group. A network entity, such<br>
as MSM 32, may receive the authorization request via PDSN 30 and packet-switched<br>
network 36. MSM 32 may verify, by communicating with AAA server 34, that MS 12 and<br>
18 are authorized to receive the requested multicast messages, step 62. Once MS 12 and 18<br>
are recognized by MSM 32, MSM 32 can send a filtering key or mask to MS 12 and MS 18,<br>
as shown at step 64 and described in detail above, to allow those MSs to further process<br>
multicast messages.<br>
Then, at step 66, MS 12 and 18 may send "JOIN" messages to RNMS 26. As<br>
illustrated by step 68, MAS 38 may, based on either time or an event trigger (such as receipt<br>
of new data via packet-switched network 36), transmit multicast data to RNMS 26 via<br>
packet-switched network 36 and PDSN 30. At step 70, when RNMS 26 receives multicast<br>
data, it may route the data to only those cell sectors currently serving MSs that have<br>
requested (by sending "join" messages) to receive the multicasts. RNMS 26 is capable of<br>
making such routing decisions because it maintains (or has access to, via another network<br>
entity) a record that correlates particular multicast groups (by multicast address) to sectors<br>
of interest. A simplified example of such a record is shown in Table 1 of Fig. 5. Further,<br>
RNMS 26 may be a multicast-aware router/server, i.e., a router/server that can actively<br>
signal a packet network to receive multicast packets with destination addresses within the IP<br>
multicast range of 224.0.0.1 through 239.255.255.255.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, multicast data could be sent to BTS 20 and 24, which<br>
serve sectors of interest, but not to BTS 22, since MS 14, served by BTS 22, has not<br>
requested the multicast via a "join" message. Once BTS 20 and BTS 24 receive multicast<br>
packets, the packets may be forwarded to MS 12 and MS 18, respectively, and MS 12 and<br>
18 may receive and further process the multicast packets (for example, by formatting and<br>
displaying, on MS 12 and 18, information contained in the packets in human-readable<br>
form), as shown at step 72.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a set of functions that may be involved in enabling an MS to receive<br>
and process multicast messages. At step 80, an MS may send an origination (or registration)<br>
message, via air an interface, to BSC 28, which can then forward the message to an MSC<br>
40. More specifically, to initiate registration in a multicast group, a user could, for example,<br>
select a menu item on the MS, causing a registration message to be sent to MSC 40 via BSC<br>
28. The origination/registration message may include information in a service option as<br>
defined by TIA/EIA-95, TIA/EIA-2000, or an equivalent standard, to determine that the call<br>
is a data call, rather than a voice call, as shown at step 82. MSC 40 can be configured to use<br>
this information and responsively send a message to BSC 28 to cause BSC 28 to transmit<br>
the data call to PDSN 30, as shown at step 84, rather than routing the call into the PSTN.<br>
Alternatively, MSC 40 could detect a data call using information other than that contained<br>
in a service option. For example, MSC 40 could recognize a data call based on the contents<br>
of OSI layer 4 (the transport layer). The method used to determine that a call is a data call is<br>
not necessarily critical to all embodiments of the present invention. PDSN 30 and the<br>
registering MS can then set up a PPP session, at step 86, and a client on the MS can set up a<br>
TCP/IP session with MSM 32, via PDSN 30 (step 88).<br>
Next, as shown at step 90, MSM 32 can communicate with a registrar such as AAA<br>
server 34 (either via packet-switched network 36, another suitable data link, or direct<br>
connection) to determine that the MS is authorized to join the multicast group. AAA server<br>
34 can maintain, separately or as part of a subscriber profile, a record of MSs that are<br>
authorized members of particular multicast groups. This information can be passed from the<br>
AAA server to MSM 32, making MSM 32 aware that a particular MS or group of MSs are<br>
authorized to receive multicast messages. Alternatively, the registrar function of AAA<br>
server 34 could be incorporated into MSM 32. Once MSM 32 recognizes an MS as an<br>
authorized group member, MSM 32 can transmit to the MS a filtering key/mask to the MS<br>
to enable it to receive and process multicast messages, as shown at step 92. If a multicast<br>
message reaches an MS in a sector of interest and the MS does not have a filtering<br>
key/mask, the MS will be unable to further process the message. In other words, the<br>
message will not effectively be received at an unauthorized MS.<br>
The architecture of the present invention also supports data broadcasting as well as<br>
cell-specific multicasting. For example, RNMS 26 can interpret a broadcast-specific IP<br>
address as an address whose data is to be forwarded to all cell sectors. For filtering at the<br>
MS at the data link layer, a common link-layer broadcast identifier that would pass through<br>
all MS filters can be used by RNMS 26 when it forwards broadcast packets, enabling all<br>
MSs to further process the broadcast data. As another example, multicasts may be<br>
designated for all MSs at particular cell sectors—e.g., for public announcements on traffic<br>
conditions. For cell-specific multicasts, RNMS 26 may recognize that packets with certain<br>
IP multicast addresses are to be forwarded to specific cell sectors only. In that case, sectors<br>
20 and 24 in Table 1 would be sectors of interest not due to the presence of MSs that are<br>
multicast group members, but because the multicast address 224.1.2.3 is "linked" to those<br>
sectors. Thus, multicast information that is only pertinent to a particular geographic area<br>
will not follow users as they move out of the area.<br>
To facilitate the routing of multicast messages, RNMS 26 may use IETF<br>
Protocol-Independent Multicast to advertise to IP core routers the presence of multicast<br>
group members on the radio network.<br>
Some steps that may be involved in the process of an MS joining a multicast group<br>
are illustrated in Fig. 7. First, an MS may send a "Join" message to RNMS 26 to indicate<br>
that it is ready and authorized to receive multicast messages (step 100). More specifically,<br>
the MS may send an IP-encapsulated IETF Internet Group Membership Protocol format<br>
message in radio network link layer framing to a BTS or BSC 28 over an access channel (or<br>
other common channel) in the radio network. When a BTS or BSC 28 receives the join<br>
message, either the BTS or BSC 28 may modify or encapsulate the message (e.g., add<br>
additional data in the link layer framing of the packet data being sent) with an indicator or<br>
identifier defining the MS"s current cell sector. The message can then be forwarded to<br>
RNMS 26, as shown at step 102. Next, RNMS 26 can update its database table to include<br>
the MS"s current sector as a sector of interest so that multicasts intended for the MS will be<br>
routed to that sector, as shown at step 104. The database table update could also include<br>
adding or deleting multicast addresses as necessary to maintain accuracy.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates some functions that may be used to ensure that the multicast<br>
database is current even after MSs leave and enter sectors of interest. As shown at step 110,<br>
a network entity such as RNMS 26 (or another entity, via the BTS), can periodically<br>
multicast queries, such as internet group management protocol (IGMP) queries, to a cell<br>
sector or sectors to determine if there is still at least one MS in a sector that is a multicast<br>
group member. If there is no such MS in the sector, the RNMS will be "aware" that the<br>
sector is no longer a sector of interest, as shown at step 112. If the sector is no longer a<br>
sector of interest, RNMS 26 could update its database table to remove the cell sector and<br>
stop routing multicast messages to the associated BTS, as shown at step 114. Conversely, if<br>
there is at least one MS in a queried sector that is a multicast group member, RNMS 26<br>
could update its database table to add the sector as a sector of interest if the sector was not a<br>
sector of interest prior to the query, as shown at step 116.<br>
Thus, RNMS 26 could maintain the accuracy of a database table in substantially<br>
real-time as MSs move through the network.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention has been described above.<br>
