				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally in the field of irrigation and more<br>
specifically it is concerned with a method and system for irrigation by<br>
 condensation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is always a demand for fresh irrigation of water and there occurs<br>
particular problems in remote country areas which lack sufficient resources of fresh<br>
water and where supply and water by pipes is costly owing to extreme distances<br>
 requiring substantially long pipes and power supplies for pumping stations etc.<br>
Various solutions are provided for that purpose, such as desalination of sea<br>
water, capturing flood water, exploiting underground aquifers etc. However, these<br>
methods of supplying irrigation water have one or more of several drawbacks such<br>
as providing water at poor quality not suitable for agriculture, high cost and low<br>
 efficiency, high wear of equipment, dependency upon precipitation, etc.<br>
Other arrangements provide recovering moisture from air masses, typically<br>
by various condensation methods. These arrangements are usually highly costly and<br>
of questionable efficiency. Some particular examples provide limited solutions<br>
adjacent coastal zones wherein deep ocean water at significantly low temperature<br>
 may be pumped for recovering of fresh water by condensation.<br>
Some of the prior art patents concerning recovering of fresh water from the<br>
moist in the air are the following U.S. patents: 661,944, 3,498,077, 3,675,442 and<br>
4,459,177.<br><br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 1,442,367, 3,890,740, 4,577,435 and 6,148,559 are all<br>
concerned with prebudding control methods and apparatuses which achieve such<br>
control by governing the temperature of the agricultural growth.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an irrigation system for<br>
 recovering water from moisture contained in the soil or air by condensation over<br>
pipes buried in the soil at a depth corresponding with depths of roots of agriculture<br>
growth or laid on the ground. The term "adjacent ground surface" will be used to<br>
denote laying the piping system either or both upon the ground surface or below<br>
ground surface, as denoted above.<br>
	The term underground is used to denote that the piping is received within<br>
any media suitable for agriculture growth, wherein the pipes are received within<br>
said media. In case of an artificial soil bedding this term may be understood also as<br>
in-ground, depending on the context. Herein the specification and claims, the terms<br>
ground and soil are interchangeably used to denote the growing media.<br>
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an<br>
irrigation system comprising an energized cooling system for cooling a liquid to a<br>
temperature below ground temperature, closed-loop placed on or adjacent below<br>
ground surface and an energized liquid circulating arrangement for circulating the<br>
	liquid through the system, whereby propelling the cooled liquid through the piping<br>
extracts moisture from the environment (air and soil) by condensation over the<br>
piping, for consumption by agriculture growth in the vicinity of the piping. By an<br>
embodiment of the invention, substantial portions of the piping may be laid on the<br>
ground.<br>
	The term closed-loop denoted a system wherein substantially there is no loss<br>
of liquid to the environment.<br>
In order to increase overall thermal efficiency, one or more components of<br>
the system are buried under ground for reducing heat loss during hot hours of the<br><br>
day. In some cases it might be advantageous to provide additional cooling systems<br>
for increasing performances of the system.<br>
Typically, the cooling system includes heat exchanger arrangements for<br>
cooling the liquid.<br>
The system can be a so-called stand alone irrigation system, or it may be<br>
used as a co-existing system along with a conventional irrigation system, where<br>
each of the systems may be selectively used.<br>
The liquid circulating arrangement and the cooling system may be energized<br>
by a variety of energy sources such as, solar energy supply, wind energy, electric<br>
energy (main supply, generators, etc,), hydraulic energy, biomass energy and source<br>
of natural cold water.<br>
In order to increase the amount of liquid recovered by condensation, the<br>
piping may be inert with increased section area as, compared with a pipe having a<br>
circular cross-section. This is possible by forming the piping with indentations or<br>
serrated sheath surface, increasing the effective surface of the piping which is in<br>
contact with the ground.<br>
Typically, a control system is provided for retaining a substantially constant<br>
AT by regulating liquid temperature, where:<br>
AT=TgTl<br>
Tg = ground temperature measure at the vicinity of the piping;<br>
Tl = liquid temperature running through the piping, and where Tf &gt; 0.<br>
The control system is utilized also for governing flow parameters and<br>
operative patterns of the irrigation system, e.g. sensing the humidity of the soil or<br>
ambient air at different hours of the day in order to recover maximum condensation<br>
liquid, determining hours of the day during which the liquids in the system is at its<br>
minimal temperature, etc.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is<br>
provided a method for underground irrigation according to which a liquid is<br>
propelled at a temperature below ground temperature, through a closed piping<br><br>
system buried below ground surface, thereby condensing liquid over the piping<br>
sheath for consumption by agriculture growth in the vicinity of the piping.<br>
In accordance with the irrigation method of the invention, the piping is<br>
connected to a liquid reservoir, a circulating arrangement and a cooling system for<br>
chilling the liquid.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the irrigation system<br>
comprises an irrigation system comprising a closed-loop piping system of which at<br>
least a portion of which is a condensing section extending on or adjacent below<br>
ground surface, and at least another portion of which is a cool-collecting section<br>
buried under ground at a cool ground zone; said closed-loop piping holding a liquid<br>
which is propelled by a circulating system fitted along the piping system; whereby<br>
said liquid is chilled by heat exchanging at the cool ground zone and then flows to<br>
the condensing section where moisture from the vicinity is extracted by<br>
condensation over condensing section readily available for consumption by<br>
agriculture growth.<br>
The term "cool ground zone" as used herein in the specification refers to a<br>
level under ground wherein the mean soil temperature remains essentially constant<br>
in spite decrease in depth. This zone is at a depth at which temperature differences<br>
are minor. The arrangement in accordance with this application is such that the<br>
liquid at the cool-collecting section is chilled by the soil which is significantly<br>
cooler than ambient air temperature and as the chilled liquid reaches the<br>
condensing section, it causes condensation over sheets of the piping at the<br>
condensing section, extracting moisture from the environment which is then to be<br>
consumed by the growth.<br>
An advantage of the system in accordance with the invention is that the<br>
cooled liquid flowing through the condensing section has positive influence on the<br>
crops as known per se. Even more so, during winter time, in case of frost on the<br>
ground, liquid flowing through the system does not freeze as the temperature at the<br>
cool ground zone remains above freezing point and accordingly, liquid flowing<br>
through the condensing section may prevent frost and damage of the growth.<br><br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the irrigation system<br>
comprises a piping system formed with at least a condensing section extending on<br>
or adjacent below ground surface, a cool-collecting section extending into an<br>
underground water reservoir at a cool ground zone and a return section extending<br>
 from said condensing section to the reservoir; wherein water from said reservoir is<br>
pumped and propelled through said condensing section by a circulating system<br>
fitted along the piping system, said water then being returned to said reservoir by<br>
the return section; whereby moisture from the vicinity is extracted by condensation<br>
over condensing section, readily available for consumption by agriculture growth.<br>
	Where the ambient relative humidity is low, a cooling system may be<br>
incorporated with the irrigation system, to thereby reduce the temperature of the<br>
liquid within the piping for improving condensation performances.<br>
Typically there is provided a control system in association with the irrigation<br>
system for determining the due point temperature which is the temperature at which<br>
the chilled liquid flowing within the condensing section must reach and the ambient<br>
temperature surrounding the condensing section, for moisture to form on sheets of<br>
the piping.<br>
The liquid flowing through the piping is at essentially constant pressure.<br>
An irrigation system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is<br>
 arranged such that the piping system comprises several condensing sections and<br>
several cool-collecting sections; said cool-collecting sections being arranged in<br>
altering depths to thereby minimize heat transfer influence between adjoining<br>
sections.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
Attention is first directed to Fig. 1 of the drawings illustrating the irrigating<br>
system generally designated 10 wherein a closed loop of piping 12 is buried under<br>
ground surface, e.g. at a depth of between about 5 to 20 cm, with an inlet end 14<br>
and an outlet end 16. Where the piping is buried the actual depth of the piping<br>
should correspond with the depth of roots of a respective agriculture growth.<br>
However, it is to be appreciated that the piping may be laid on the ground surface.<br>
As already mentioned above, the ground may also be a soil bedding of any type<br>
wherein the piping is received within the bedding. By a modification of the<br>
invention, the piping may be laid on ground surface (not shown).<br>
Inlet 14 is connected to a cooling system 22 whilst outlet 16 is connected to<br>
a circulating pumping arrangement 26. In the present example cooling system 22<br>
and pumping system 26 are received in a common housing 28 with a wind-operated<br>
electric supply system generally designated at 30 energizing both the cooling<br><br>
system 22 and the circulating pump 26. It will be however appreciated that each of<br>
cooling system 22 and circulating pump 26 may be located at any location of the<br>
plant with a common energizing system in accordance with the present example or<br>
separate ones.<br>
	The piping 12 may be made of simple plastic or any other material which<br>
provides increased condensation thereabout as known per se. Typically, the piping<br>
is buried at a depth which corresponds to the root depth of a specific growth<br>
planted in the site. In order to improve condensation, the area of contact of the<br>
piping with the soil may be increased by providing piping 33 with increased sheath<br>
 area having a cross-sectional shape formed with a plurality of axial projections 34<br>
(Fig. 3 A) or a piping 35 formed plurality of axial indentations 36 (Fig. 3B).<br>
When fluid, typically a liquid such as water, is cooled in the cooling<br>
system 22 and is then circulated through piping 12 by means of circulating<br>
pump 26 (if required, several circulating pumps may be fitted in the system),<br>
thermal gradient develops between the soil and the sheath of the piping 42,<br>
resulting in condensation induced around the piping, whereby the humidity of the<br>
soil in the vicinity of the piping is converted into liquid available for consumption<br>
by the roots of the plants 38.<br>
It is known that cold water agriculture yields crops having rapid growth,<br>
high yield with high sugar and aromatic content of the fruits and vegetables.<br>
Further attention is now directed to Fig. 2 illustrating a modification of the<br>
previous embodiment wherein the piping 42 is buried under ground level, as in<br>
accordance with the previous embodiment, wherein the piping 42 is connected at a<br>
first inlet 46 to a first cooling system 50 with a second inlet 55 and outlet 56<br>
 connected to a second cooling system 57 positioned at a remote end of the irrigated<br>
field or at any suitable location, thereby obtaining improved thermal efficiency of<br>
the system. A pumping unit 60 is incorporated in the same housing as the first<br>
cooling system 50 whereby solar panels 64 and 66 supply the required electric<br>
power for energizing the cooling systems and the circulating pump, respectively.<br><br>
Further seen in the embodiment of Fig. 2 there is a control unit generally<br>
designated 70 which is schematically represented and which comprises a variety of<br>
control means receiving different inputs such as liquid temperature within<br>
piping 42, inlet and outlet temperature at the cooling systems 50 and 54, soil<br>
 temperature in the vicinity of the piping, relative humidity in the soil, precipitation<br>
(rain, dew, etc.) According to the data received, the control unit 70 emits operating<br>
signals to operate or cease operation of the system, pumping rate, temperature of<br>
liquid at the cooling system outlet, etc.<br>
Attention is now directed to Figs. 4A and 4B illustrating an irrigation system<br>
f in accordance with a modification of the invention generally designated 80.<br>
Irrigation system comprises two or more parallel closed loop piping systems 82,<br>
each having a condensing section 84 extending above or adjacent below ground<br>
surface 88, and a cool- collecting section 90 ascending deep under ground surface<br>
at a depth D (Fig. 4). The depth D is typically greater then 1 meter. which is<br>
considered a cool ground zone. The condensing section 84 and the cool-collecting<br>
section 90 are in flow communication via tube sections 96 and 98 which together<br>
constitute a closed loop piping 82. A control station 102 comprising a circulation<br>
system typically a pump P and optionally also a control system designated C which<br>
will be specified hereinafter. Circulating system P may be a regular liquid<br>
propelling pump which may be energized by different known means, e.g. electric,<br>
wind, petrol, biomass, solar, etc.<br>
The depth D at which the cool-collecting section 90 extends, referred to as<br>
the "cool ground zone", is selected at a depth such that the soil temperature remains<br>
around an average value which is substantially cooler than mean air temperature.<br>
Determining the soil temperature as it varies with time and depth may be carried<br>
out by different means, using different mathematical models as can be calculated<br>
for example in the Website of the Intermountain Resource Inventories, Inc. at<br>
http//soilphysics.okstate.edu/toolkit/temperature/index0.html.<br>
Arrangement is such that a liquid flowing through the piping 82 is chilled at<br>
the cool-collecting section 90 and when it reaches the condensing section 84,<br><br>
owing to temperature difference with ambient temperature, moisture is formed on<br>
the sheath of the condensing section 84.<br>
Whilst in the figures the condensing section 84 is located right above ground<br>
surface 88, it is to be appreciated that rather the condensing section may be<br>
 positioned at a short distance below ground surface, e.g. several centimeters below<br>
ground surface at a level corresponding with the level of roots of the agriculture<br>
growth.<br>
Even more so, an advantage of the irrigation system in accordance with the<br>
invention that the cold liquid flowing through the condensing section has positive<br>
 influence on the crops as known per se. Even more so, the system has an additional<br>
benefit in that during winter time, in case of frost on the ground, liquid flowing<br>
through the system does not freeze as the temperature at the cool ground zone<br>
remains above freezing point and accordingly, liquid flowing through the<br>
condensing section may prevent frost and damage of the growth.<br>
	Further attention is now directed to Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B illustrating a<br>
particular lay out of an irrigation system in accordance with the present invention in<br>
which like components as in the embodiment of Figs. 4A and 4B are designated<br>
like reference numbers.<br>
The system 110 comprises three closed loop piping systems 112 each having<br>
 a condensing section 84 (to be laid on ground surface or adjacent below) and cool-<br>
collecting sections, two of which designated 90 extending at a first depth D1 (best<br>
seen in Fig. 5B) and an intermediate cool-collecting section 116 extending at a<br>
deeper level D2 whereby the connecting tube sections 118 is necessarily longer<br>
than corresponding portion 96 on the adjoining piping systems. The piping<br>
 systems 112 are laterally spaced apart by a distance L (Fig. 5B) and each system is<br>
provided with a control unit 102' which has a similar function as in the embodiment<br>
of Figs. 4A and 4B but is buried under ground surface, e.g. for minimal space<br>
consuming, for temper preventing and for retaining it at a temperature below<br>
ambient temperature.<br><br>
The arrangement of Figs. 5A and 5B is useful to ensure that the cool-<br>
collecting sections 90 and 116 are sufficiently remote from one another so as to<br>
minimize heat transfer between the adjoining sections.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 6, there is illustrated an irrigation system 122<br>
 which is principally similar to the previous embodiments, the difference residing in<br>
that the cool-collecting system 124 comprises a heat exchanging unit 126 e.g. in the<br>
form of a plurality of looped pipes or a structure provided with fins for increasing<br>
heat exchange with the soil so as to rapidly cool the liquid flowing through that<br>
section.<br>
	In the embodiment of Fig. 7, there is provided an irrigation system<br>
comprising several closed loop piping systems 130 which rather than each being<br>
provided with an independent pump, there is a central control unit 132 provided<br>
with a controlling mechanism and a pump unit for selectively circulating liquid<br>
through each of the closed loop piping systems 130 at intervals, e.g. depending<br>
 upon cooling rate of the liquid at the cool-collecting system, etc.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates still another application of the present invention,<br>
wherein an irrigation system generally designated 150 comprises a looped<br>
condensing section 152 extending on ground surface 154 (though it may just as<br>
well be buried adjacent below ground surface). A cool water collecting pipe<br>
 segment 158 extends from the looped condensing section into a cool water<br>
reservoir 160 e.g. a well (dug or natural), and a return water section 162 also<br>
extends into the water reservoir 160. A pumping unit 166 is fitted at a suitable<br>
location of the piping, e.g. at the looped condensing section 152. Water is pumped<br>
from the water reservoir 160 by pump 166 and is propelled through the looped<br>
5 condensing section 152, where moisture from the vicinity is extracted by<br>
condensation over the condensing section, readily available for consumption by<br>
agriculture growth. The water then flows back by gravity (or by the pump) into the<br>
water reservoir 160.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the invention have been exemplified, it<br>
 should be clear that it is not intended thereby to limit the disclosure of the<br><br>
invention, but rather it is intended to cover all modifications and arrangements<br>
falling within the scope and spirit of the present invention, mutatis mutandis.<br>
For example, different layout of cooling system and pumping units may be<br>
set up, depending on topographic conditions, etc. Furthermore, the energizing<br>
 power for a system in accordance with the present invention may be any suitable<br>
system such as, for example, solar, wind, electric, hydraulic, biomass, etc.<br><br>
