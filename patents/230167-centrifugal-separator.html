Centrifugal Separator<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a centrifugal separator<br>
which comprises a screw conveyor inside of a bowl, supports<br>
them so as to be relatively rotatable, separates the object to<br>
be treated from a feed stock supplied to the inside of said<br>
bowl, and carries out cleaning and deliquidization of said<br>
object to be treated with a screen part provided along the<br>
inner circumferential surface at one end of the bowl, a hub of<br>
said screw conveyor having a cleaning liquid receiving part for<br>
receiving the cleaning liquid supplied to the inside of the hub<br>
and a cleaning nozzle which jet spouts the cleaning liquid from<br>
the inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part toward said<br>
screen part. Such a centrifugal separator is used for<br>
purification of a variety of crystals in the field of the<br>
chemical industry and the food industry.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
With conventional screen bowl type centrifugal separators,<br>
when a feed stock consisting of crystalline solid matters and a<br>
solvent is supplied to the inside of the bowl, the feed stock<br>
is separated into the crystals, which are the object to be<br>
treated, and the solvent by the centrifugal force, the crystals<br>
being settled onto the inner circumferential surface of the<br>
bowl, conveyed by the screw conveyor which is provided with a<br>
minute difference in speed between it and the bowl, and<br>
subjected to deliquidization at the tapered part provided on<br>
one side of the bowl.<br>
The deliquidized crystals generally have impurities<br>
produced in the process of manufacture thereof, and the solvent<br>
itself deposited on their surfaces, and in order to clean these<br>
surplus deposits, a screen part has conventionally been<br>
provided on the inner circumferential side of the bowl<br><br>
following the tapered part, with cleaning nozzles which jet<br>
spout the cleaning liquid toward the pertinent portion being<br>
provided in the hub of the screw conveyor for carrying out<br>
cleaning by jet spouting the cleaning liquid all over the<br>
crystals which are being conveyed in the screen part. For<br>
example, refer to the patent literature 1 (Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 2000-325831).<br>
However, with the screen bowl type centrifugal separator<br>
as mentioned above, the crystals will not be conveyed by the<br>
conveyor in the clearance in the radial direction that is formed<br>
between the outer circumferential edge of the flight of the<br>
screw conveyor and the inner circumferential surface of the<br>
screen part, the residual layer of crystals being pressed<br>
against the outer circumferential edge of the flight to be<br>
firmly tightened without being moved in a long period of time<br>
of operation.<br>
The crystals forming such a residual layer present a problem<br>
that they impede not only the penetration of the cleaning liquid,<br>
but also the movement of themselves for replacement with new<br>
residual layer crystals. Such a condition is generally called<br>
screen clogging. To eliminate the condition of clogged screen,<br>
it has been required to temporarily stop the supply of the feed<br>
stock, and instead, supply the cleaning liquid for a certain<br>
period of time. Thus, while the supply of the feed stock is<br>
stopped, the production is interrupted, which has been a factor<br>
of lowering the productivity.<br>
Further, there has been a problem that, when the cleaning<br>
liquid is applied to all over the whole of the crystals which<br>
are conveyed by the flight, a part of the crystals is caused<br>
to leak in the screen part by the amount which is in proportion<br>
to that of the cleaning liquid passing through the layer of<br>
the crystals, and the amount which is in proportion to the mesh<br>
size of the screen.<br>
Being developed in view of the problems of the prior art<br>
as mentioned above, the present invention is intended to<br>
provide a screen bowl type centrifugal separator which can not<br><br>
only eliminate the problem of reduction in productivity<br>
resulting from the occurrence of clogging due to the object to<br>
be treated, such as crystals, in particular, in the screen<br>
part, which is the critical portion of the screen bowl type<br>
centrifugal separator, but also minimize the amount of leakage<br>
of the object to be treated in the screen part.<br>

[12] The centrifugal separator of item 7, item 8, item 9, item<br>

hub to the side closer to the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
flight, and is mounted through supporting plates which are arranged<br>
at prescribed intervals.<br>
Next, the function of the present invention will be described.<br>
When the feed stock is supplied to the inside of the bowl, the<br>
centrifugal force separates the feed stock into the object to be<br>
treated and the mother liquid inside of the bowl, the object to be<br>
treated being settled onto the inner circumferential surface of the<br>
bowl, and such object to be treated is conveyed by the screw conveyor<br>
which is provided with a difference in rotational speed between it<br>
and the bowl. However, in the radial clearance formed between<br>
the outer circumferential edge of the flight of the screw conveyor<br>
and the inner circumferential surface of the screen part, the<br><br>
object to be treated is not sufficiently conveyed by the<br>
conveyor, forming a residual layer.<br>
The object to be treated deliguidized on the way of being<br>
conveyed generally have impurities produced in the process of<br>
manufacture thereof, and the mother liquid itself deposited<br>
on their surfaces, and in order to remove these surplus<br>
deposited matters, at least a part of the cleaning liquid is<br>
directly jet spouted toward the residual layer crystals formed<br>
in the clearance between the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
flight of the screw conveyor and the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the screen part from the liquid conduction part in<br>
the screen part provided along the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the bowl at the one end side thereof.<br>
Thereby, besides the whole of the object to be treated, the<br>
residual layer crystals formed in the clearance between the<br>
outer circumferential edge of the flight of the screw conveyor<br>
and the inner circumferential surface of said screen part can<br>
be directly cleaned in particular, thus no residual layer<br>
crystals are anchored, resulting in the movability being<br>
enhanced, and the penetrability of the cleaning liquid through<br>
the whole of the object to be treated during conveying being<br>
improved. Therefore, clogging with the object to be treated<br>
in the screen part can be prevented; the amount of the cleaning<br>
liquid as that for substitution of the impurities in the object<br>
to be treated, which is the original application, can be<br>
minimized; and the amount of leakage of the object to be treated<br>
in the screen part can be minimized.<br>
At least a part of the cleaning liquid is directly jet<br>
spouted toward the residual layer crystals formed in the<br>
clearance between the outer circumferential edge of the flight<br>
of the screw conveyor and the inner circumferential surface<br>
of the screen part from the liquid conduction part. Because<br>
said liquid conduction part is provided such that the thickness<br>
of the residual layer crystals is held to within 10 mm by the<br>
penetration of the cleaning liquid jet spouted from the liquid<br><br>
conduction part. Because said liquid conduction part is provided such<br>
that the thickness of the residual layer crystals is held to within 10<br>
mm by the penetration of the cleaning liquid jet spouted from the liquid<br>
conduction part, the cleaning liquid effectively passes through the<br>
residual layer crystals, which allows the amount of leakage of the<br>
object to be treated in the screen part to be more effectively reduced.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item [1], at<br>
least a part of the cleaning liquid is directly jet spouted toward the<br>
residual layer crystals formed in the clearance between the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight of the screw conveyor and the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the screen part from the liquid conduction<br>
part. Because the tip of at least a part of the cleaning liquid<br>
conduction part is located within 10 mm from the inner surface of the<br>
screen part, the cleaning liquid effectively passes through the residual<br>
layer crystals, which makes it possible to more effectively reduce the<br>
amount of leakage of the object to be treated in the screen part.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item [2],<br>
when the feed stock is supplied to the inside of the bowl, the<br>
centrifugal force separates the feed stock into the object to be treated<br>
and the mother liquid inside of the bowl, the object to be treated being<br>
settled onto the inner circumferential surface of the bowl, and such<br>
object to be treated is conveyed by the screw conveyor which is<br>
provided with a difference in rotational speed between it and the bowl.<br>
However, in the radial clearance formed between the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight of the screw conveyor and the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the screen part, the object to be treated is<br>
not sufficiently conveyed by the conveyor, forming a residual layer.<br>
The object to be treated deliquidized on the way of being<br>
conveyed generally have impurities produced in the process of<br>
manufacture thereof, and the mother liquid itself deposited on<br>
their surfaces, and in order to remove these surplus<br>
deposited matters, the cleaning liquid is jet spouted toward<br>
the object to be treated from the cleaning nozzle provided<br>
in the hub of the screw conveyor for carrying out cleaning in the<br><br>
screen part provided along the inner circumferential surface<br>
of the bowl at the one end side thereof. The cleaning liquid<br>
mentioned here is supplied to the inside of the cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part provided inside of said hub through the cleaning<br>
liquid supply path separately provided inside of the feed tube<br>
for supplying the feed stock to the inside of the bowl, for<br>
example.<br>
Inside of said cleaning liquid receiving part, a residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part for receiving the<br>
cleaning liquid for cleaning the residual layer of said object<br>
to be treated is provided, being partitioned independently of<br>
the inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part, and the<br>
cleaning liquid supplied to the inside of this residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid receiving part is directly jet spouted<br>
toward the residual layer object to be treated from the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight through the residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid path formed along the direction of the<br>
helix of the flight, with no relation to said cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part. Thereby, the cleaning of the object to be<br>
treated by the cleaning nozzle and the cleaning of the residual<br>
layer object to be treated by the residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid path can be separately performed, which allows<br>
the respective cleaning liquids to be rendered different from<br>
each other in type and amount of liquid.<br>
Thus, besides the whole of the object to be treated, the<br>
residual layer object to be treated formed in the clearance<br>
between the outer circumferential edge of the flight of said<br>
screw conveyor and the inner circumferential surface of said<br>
screen part can be directly cleaned in particular, thus no<br>
residual layer object to be treated is anchored, resulting in<br>
the movability being enhanced, and the penetrability of the<br>
cleaning liquid through the whole of the object to be treated<br>
during conveying being improved. Therefore, clogging with the<br>
object to be treated in the screen part can be prevented; the<br>
amount of the cleaning liquid as that for substitution of the<br>
impurities in the object to be treated, which is the original<br><br>
application, can be minimized; and the amount of leakage of the<br>
object to be treated in the screen part can be minimized.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item [3],<br>
the cleaning liquid inside of said residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part springs out into the inside of the bowl from<br>
the cleaning liquid discharge holes provided in the wall of the hub<br>
or the flight of said screw conveyor, being passed through the<br>
connection tubes disposed at prescribed intervals along the direction<br>
of the helix of the flight in the locations where the inner<br>
circumferential edges of the flight range. The cleaning liquid<br>
discharge holes are radially extended from the inner circumferential<br>
surface side of the hub to the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
flight, allowing the cleaning liquid to be directly jet spouted<br>
toward said residual layer object to be treated from the tip opening<br>
of said respective cleaning liquid discharge holes which are opened<br>
at the outer circumferential edge of the flight.<br>
Herein, if, as with the centrifugal separator as defined in item<br>
[5], a channel which consecutively extends along the direction of the<br>
helix of said flight, and to which the tip opening of said<br>
respective cleaning liquid discharge holes is connected is formed in<br>
the tip surface of the outer circumferential edge of the flight, the<br>
cleaning liquid from the tip opening of said respective cleaning<br>
liquid discharge holes is spread throughout the entire area of the<br>
outer circumferential edge of the flight along the channel, and can<br>
be directly jet spouted toward said residual layer object to be<br>
treated such that the cleaning liquid is spread over the entire<br>
circumference in the radial direction.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item<br>
[4], the cleaning liquid inside of said residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part passes through the connection<br>
tubes which are provided at prescribed intervals along the<br>
direction of the helix of said flight in the locations<br>
adjacent to the surface on the side opposite to the object-to-be-<br>
treated conveying surface of the flight, and the cleaning liquid<br><br>
connection holes provided in the wall of the hub of said' screw<br>
conveyor, being introduced into the cleaning liquid discharge pipes<br>
which are provided at prescribed intervals along the direction of the<br>
helix of said flight on the surface on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to-be-treated conveying surface of the flight.<br>
The respective cleaning liquid discharge pipes extend radially , •<br>
from the inner circumferential edge to the outer circumferential edge<br>
of the flight, and from the tip opening of the respective cleaning<br>
liquid discharge pipes disposed along the outer circumferential edge<br>
of the flight, the cleaning liquid can be directly jet spouted toward<br>
said residual layer object to be treated. According to such a<br>
configuration, the need for work to provide holes in the flight<br>
itself is eliminated, and the cleaning liquid discharge pipes can be<br>
post-attached to the flight, which allows the manufacture to be<br>
carried out relatively easily.<br>
Further, in order to supply the cleaning liquid to the inside of<br>
said cleaning liquid receiving part and the inside of said residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part provided inside of the<br>
hub of said screw conveyor, a part of the feed tube for supplying the<br>
feed stock that is also inserted into the inside of the hub can be<br>
effectively used, as with the centrifugal separator as defined in<br>
said item [6].<br>
In other words, a cleaning liquid supply path for supplying the<br>
cleaning liquid to the inside of said cleaning liquid receiving part<br>
is formed inside of the feed tube, and at intermediate points on the<br>
feed tube that are opposed to said cleaning liquid receiving part in<br>
the radial direction, openings of the cleaning liquid supply path are<br>
provided.<br>
Similarly, a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid<br>
supply path for supplying the cleaning liquid to the inside<br>
of said residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part is<br>
formed inside of the feed tube;, and at intermediate points on the<br>
feed tube that are opposed to said residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part in the radial direction, openings of the<br><br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply path are provided.<br>
Thereby, the cleaning liquid can be separately and effectively<br>
supplied to the inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part and the<br>
inside of the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item [7],<br>
when the feed stock is supplied to the inside of the bowl, the<br>
centrifugal force separates the feed stock into the object to be<br>
treated and the mother liquid inside of the bowl, the object to be<br>
treated being settled onto the inner circumferential surface of the<br>
bowl, and such object to be treated is conveyed by the screw conveyor<br>
which is provided with a difference in rotational speed between it<br>
and the bowl. However, in the radial clearance formed between the<br>
outer circumferential edge of the flight of the screw conveyor and<br>
the inner circumferential surface of the screen part, the object to<br>
be treated is not sufficiently conveyed by the conveyor, forming a<br>
residual layer.<br>
The object to be treated deliquidized on the way of being<br>
conveyed generally have impurities produced in the process of<br>
manufacture thereof, and the mother liquid itself deposited on their<br>
surfaces, and in order to remove these surplus deposited matters, the<br>
cleaning liquid is directly jet spouted toward the object to be<br>
treated from the cleaning nozzle provided in the hub of the screw<br>
conveyor for carrying out cleaning in the screen part provided along<br>
the inner circumferential surface of the bowl at the one end side<br>
thereof. The cleaning liquid mentioned here is supplied to the inside<br>
of the cleaning liquid receiving part provided inside of said hub<br>
through the cleaning liquid supply path separately provided inside<br>
of the feed tube for supplying the feed stock to the inside of the<br>
bowl, for example.<br>
The cleaning liquid inside of said cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part is not only jet spouted from said cleaning nozzle, but also<br>
springs out into the inside of the bowl from the plurality of<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid discharge holes which are<br>
arranged at prescribed intervals along the direction of the helix of<br>
said flight in the locations adjacent to the surface on the side<br><br>
opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying surface of the flight.<br>
Herein, the cleaning liquid is directly jet spouted toward the<br>
residual layer object to be treated through the small clearance<br>
between the cover flight with a small width that extends in the<br>
direction of the helix of the flight with a prescribed spacing being<br>
given with respect to the surface on the side opposite to the object-<br>
to-be-treated conveying surface of the flight along the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the surface on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to- be-treated conveying surface of the flight, and the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight, without being scattered.<br>
Thereby, besides cleaning of the whole of the object to be<br>
treated by means of the cleaning nozzles, the residual layer object<br>
to be treated can be locally cleaned as well in particular, thus no<br>
residual layer object to be treated is anchored, resulting in the<br>
movability being enhanced, and the penetrability of the cleaning<br>
liquid through the whole of the object to be treated during conveying<br>
being improved. Therefore, clogging with the object to be treated in<br>
the screen part can be prevented; the amount of the cleaning liquid<br>
as that for substitution of the impurities in the object to be<br>
treated, which is the original application, can be minimized ; and<br>
the amount of leakage of the object to be treated in the screen part<br>
can be minimized.<br>
As with the centrifugal separator as defined in item [8],when<br>
said cleaning liquid receiving part is provided with a partition<br>
plate which partitions the inside of the cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part into two or more in the axial direction in the screen part of<br>
said bowl, the cleaning liquid may be supplied to the inside of all<br>
the compartments of said cleaning liquid receiving part through the<br>
cleaning liquid supply path separately provided inside of the feed<br>
tube for supplying the feed stock to the inside of the bowl, or the<br>
cleaning liquid may be supplied to the inside of only a part of the<br>
compartments, for example.<br>
In such a case, the cleaning liquid is jet spouted toward the<br>
screen part only in the range where it is opposed, in the radial<br>
direction of the bowl, to the inside of the compartment of the<br><br>
cleaning liquid receiving part to which the cleaning liquid has been<br>
supplied. Thereby, the cleaning range in the screen part can be<br>
selected as appropriate.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item [9], a<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part for receiving<br>
the cleaning liquid for cleaning the residual layer of the object to<br>
be treated is provided inside of said cleaning liquid receiving part,<br>
being partitioned independently of the inside of the cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part, and the cleaning liquid which has been supplied to<br>
the inside of this residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part passes through the connection tubes which are provided at<br>
prescribed intervals along the direction of the helix of said flight<br>
in the locations adjacent to the surface on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to-be-treated conveying surface of the flight, and springs<br>
out from the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid discharge holes<br>
provided in the wall of the hub of said screw conveyor.<br>
The cleaning liquid which has sprung out into the inside of the<br>
bowl can be directly jet spouted toward said residual layer object to<br>
be treated through the small clearance between the cover flight with<br>
a small width that extends in the direction of the helix of said<br>
flight along the outer circumferential edge of the surface on the<br>
side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying surface of the<br>
flight, and the outer circumferential edge of the flight, without<br>
being scattered. Thereby, as with the centrifugal separator as<br>
defined in item [7], the penetrability of the cleaning liquid through<br>
the object to be treated, and the movability of the residual layer<br>
object to be treated can be enhanced.<br>
Further, with the present centrifugal separator, in order to<br>
supply the cleaning liquid to the inside of the cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part and the inside of the residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part provided inside of the hub of said screw<br>
conveyor, a part of the feed tube for supplying the feed stock that<br>
is inserted into the inside of the hub can be effectively used, as<br>
mentioned in item [10].<br><br>
In other words, a cleaning liquid supply path for supplying the<br>
cleaning liquid to the inside of said cleaning liquid receiving part<br>
is formed inside of the feed tube, and at intermediate points on the<br>
feed tube that are opposed to said cleaning liquid receiving part in<br>
the radial direction, openings of the cleaning liquid supply path are<br>
provided.<br>
Similarly, a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply path<br>
for supplying the cleaning liquid to the inside of said residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part is formed inside of the<br>
feed tube, and at intermediate points on the feed tube that are<br>
opposed to said residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part in the radial direction, openings of the residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid supply path are provided. Thereby, the cleaning<br>
liquid can be separately and effectively supplied to the inside of<br>
the cleaning liquid receiving part and the inside of the residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part.<br>
According to the centrifugal separator as defined in item [11],<br>
a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving chamber which<br>
receives the cleaning liquid for cleaning the residual layer of the<br>
object to be treated is provided inside of said hub on one side<br>
thereof independently of said cleaning liquid receiving part, and the<br>
cleaning liquid which has been supplied to the inside of this<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving chamber is<br>
introduced into the respective plurality of residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid introducing tubes arranged on the outer circumference<br>
of the hub.<br>
And, the cleaning liquid which has been introduced into the<br>
respective residual layer crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes<br>
passes through the respective plurality of residual, layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid discharge holes which are provided at prescribed<br>
intervals at intermediate points on the respective residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes, springing out into the<br>
inside of the bowl. The cleaning liquid which has sprung out can be<br>
directly jet spouted toward said residual layer object to be treated<br>
through the small clearance between the cover flight with a small<br><br>
width that extends in the direction of the helix of said flight along<br>
the outer circumferential edge of the surface on the side opposite to<br>
the object-to-be-treated conveying surface of the flight, and the<br>
outer circumferential edge of the flight. Thereby, as with the<br>
centrifugal separator as defined in items [7] and [9] , the<br>
penetrability of the cleaning liquid through the object to be<br>
treated, and the movability of the residual layer object to be<br>
treated can be enhanced.<br>
Further, if, as with the centrifugal separator as defined in<br>
item [12], said cover flight is mounted, being provided with a slope<br>
with respect to the surface on the side opposite to the object-to-be-<br>
treated conveying surface of said flight such that the clearance is<br>
gradually narrowed down from the side closer to said hub to the side<br>
closer to the outer circumferential edge of the flight, and is<br>
mounted through supporting plates which are arranged at prescribed<br>
intervals, the cleaning liquid which springs out from said hub side<br>
can be received in a wide span, and the received cleaning liquid can<br>
be directly jet spouted toward the residual layer object to be<br>
treated from a narrow span.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinbelow, various exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 to FIG. 3 show a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A centrifugal separator 10 according to the present<br>
embodiment is a so-called screen bowl type centrifugal<br>
separator, comprising a screw conveyor 40, inside of a<br>
substantially cylindrical type bowl 20, and supporting the<br>
screw conveyor 40 and the bowl 20 such that these are relatively<br>
rotatable, and is configured such that a feed stock supplied<br>
to the inside of said bowl 20 can be separated into the object<br>
to be treated and the mother liquid.<br>
Herein, the object to be treated refers to a variety of<br>
crystals, and the like in the chemical industry and the food<br>
industry, and particularly, refers to, for example,<br>
terephthalic acid, which is a raw material for PET bottles and<br>
polyester fabrics, paraxylene, which is a raw material for<br>
terephthalic acid, bisphenol, which is a raw material for<br>
CD-ROM, monosodium glutamate, which is a raw material for<br>
chemical seasonings, and the like. The mother solution refers<br>
to various solvents. With the variety of crystals,<br>
unpolymerized substances and the solvent constituting the<br>
slurry have deposited on their surfaces in the manufacturing<br>
process, and these deposited matters can be<br>
cleaning-substituted by the cleaning liquid (a specific other<br>
solvent, or the like). Hereinbelow, the present embodiment will<br>
be described when it is applied to crystals as an object to<br>
be treated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2,- the bowl 20 and the screw conveyor 40<br>
inside thereof are rotatably pivotally supported inside of a<br>
casing 11 through shafts 12a, 12b. The bowl 20 and the screw<br>
conveyor 40 are rotation-driven with a minute difference in<br>
speed by a differential gear 14 connected to a bearing 13 on<br>
one side. Such a differential gear 14 itself is well known.<br><br>
and thus detailed description is omitted.<br>
The inside of the casing 11 is partitioned for providing<br>
a later described discharge port 24 provided for the bowl 20,<br>
a screen part 30, a dam part 26, and the like, respectively.<br>
And. under the casing 11, a crystal discharge port 15 connected<br>
to said discharge port 24, a cleaning liquid discharge port<br>
16 connected to said screen part 30, and a mother liquid<br>
discharge port 17 connected to said dam part 26 are provided,<br>
respectively.<br>
One end side (the right side in FIG. 2) of the bowl 20<br>
provides the direction along which crystals are discharged,<br>
and from the other end side (the left side in FIG. 2) of the<br>
bowl 20, the bowl is partitioned into a parallel cylinder part<br>
21 with a larger diameter, a tapered part 22 which inside<br>
diameter is gradually reduced toward the one end, and a parallel<br>
cylinder part 23 with a smaller diameter, in this order. On<br>
the end side of the parallel cylinder part 23 with a smaller<br>
diameter, a crystal discharge port 24 is formed, and on the<br>
end side of the parallel cylinder part 21 with a larger diameter,<br>
a dam part 26 which regulates the liquid level measured along<br>
the radial direction of the bowl 20, and is capable of<br>
discharging the mother liquid after the crystals having been<br>
separated, to the outside of the bowl 20 is provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the parallel cylinder part 23 with a<br>
smaller diameter has a number of filtered liquid discharge<br>
holes 25 formed in the wall surface, and is covered with a<br>
cylindrical filtering medium 31 over the entire circumference<br>
on the inner circumference side, thus providing the screen part<br>
30. For the size of the filtered liquid discharge hole 25, there<br>
is no need for much consideration about the diameter of the<br>
crystal particles, but the filtering medium 31 is made of a<br>
material having a number of minute holes or slits which diameter<br>
or size is smaller than the particle diameter of the crystals.<br>
Specifically, a wedge wire screen, a porous ceramic molding,<br>
or the like, may be used, for example. The inner circumferential<br>
surface of the parallel cylinder part 23 is cut by the depth<br><br>
equivalent to the thickness of the filtering medium 31.<br>
The screw conveyor 40 is made up of a hub 41 which provides<br>
an axis of rotation therefor, and a flight 42 which is provided<br>
in the form of a screw on the outer circumference of the hub<br>
41, and the flight 42 is formed such that the crystals are<br>
conveyed toward the one end side (the right side in FIG. 2)<br>
of the bowl 20. Between the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
flight 42 and the inner circumferential surface of the parallel<br>
cylinder part 23 (the surface of the filtering medium 31 of<br>
the screen part 30), a clearance in the radial direction is<br>
provided because the screw conveyor 40 and the bowl 20 are<br>
constructed to be rotated at different speeds.<br>
The hub 41 is provided with a cleaning liquid receiving part<br>
43 which receives the cleaning liquid supplied to the inside<br>
of the hub 41, and a cleaning nozzle 45 which jet spouts the<br>
cleaning liquid from the inside of the cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part 43 toward the screen part 30 of said bowl 20.<br>
The cleaning liquid receiving part 43 is made up of a portion<br>
which is surrounded by a partition extending by a prescribed<br>
width in the axial direction around the entire circumference<br>
of the inner circumferential surface of the hub 41.<br>
In the circumferential wall of the hub 41 that provides the<br>
bottom side of the cleaning liquid receiving part 43, a cleaning<br>
liquid connection hole 44 is provided at prescribed Intervals,<br>
and on the outer circumferential surface side of the hub 41,<br>
a cleaning nozzle 45 which is connected to said cleaning liquid<br>
connection hole 44 is protruded. Herein, the cleaning nozzle<br>
45 is disposed slightly toward the other side (the left side<br>
in FIG. 1) off the pitch center of the flight 42 and in a location<br>
where it is opposed to the screen part 30 in the radial direction,<br>
as shown.in FIG. 1.<br>
Further, inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part 43,<br>
a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part 46<br>
which receives the cleaning liquid for cleaning the residual<br>
layer crystals formed in the clearance between the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42 and the inner<br><br>
circumferential surface of the screen part 30 is provided,<br>
being partitioned independently of the inside of the cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part 43. The residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part 46 is formed by providing a partition<br>
which extends by a prescribed width in the axial direction at<br>
both ends of a cylindrical member over the entire circumference<br>
thereof, and on the bottom side, a connection tube 47 is<br>
protruded at prescribed intervals, the respective connection<br>
tubes 47 causing the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part 46 to be fixedly installed with a separation<br>
from the inner circumferential surface of the hub 41 inside<br>
of said cleaning liquid receiving part 43. As shown in FIG.<br>
1, the respective connection tubes 47 are disposed at<br>
prescribed intervals along the direction of the helix of said<br>
flight 42 in the locations where the inner circumferential<br>
edges of the flight 42 range.<br>
In the present embodiment, a plurality of cleaning liquid<br>
discharge holes 49 which connect to said respective connection<br>
tubes 47 are provided, being radially extended from the inner<br>
circumferential surface side of the hub 41 to the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42 inside the wall of the<br>
hub 41 or the flight 42 in the locations where the inner<br>
circumferential edges of the flight 42 of the screw conveyor<br>
40 range. The respective cleaning liquid discharge holes 49<br>
provide a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid path together<br>
with the respective connection tubes 47 for causing the<br>
cleaning liquid inside of said residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part 46 to be directly jet spouted toward the<br>
residual layer crystals on the screen part 30 from the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42, with no relation to said<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43.<br>
The cleaning nozzle 45 which is connected to the cleaning<br>
liquid connection hole 44 and the plurality of cleaning liquid<br>
discharge holes 49 constitute a liquid conduction part for<br>
causing at least a part of the cleaning liquid to be directly<br>
jet spouted toward the residual layer crystals formed in the<br><br>
clearance between the outer circumferential edge of the flight<br>
42 of said screw conveyor 40 and the inner circumferential<br>
surface of said screen part 30. And. the tips of the plurality<br>
of cleaning liquid discharge holes 49 to which the respective<br>
connection tubes 47 are connected, and which are at least a<br>
part of the cleaning liquid conduction part are located within<br>
10 mm from the inner surface of the screen part 30. In addition,<br>
said liquid conduction part is provided such that the thickness<br>
of the residual layer crystals is held to within 10 mm by the<br>
penetration of at least a part of the jet spouted cleaning<br>
liquid.<br>
Into the inside of the hub 41, a feed tube 60 for supplying<br>
the feed stock that extends in the axial direction of the hub<br>
41 is inserted. The starting end of the feed tube 60 extends<br>
out beyond the hub 41 and the bowl 20, providing a feed stock<br>
supply port 61, and the terminating end of the feed tube 60<br>
is disposed substantially at the center of the inside of the<br>
hub 41, providing a feed stock outlet port 62. Further, into<br>
the inside of the feed tube 60, a cleaning liquid supply tube<br>
71 providing a cleaning liquid supply path for supplying the<br>
cleaning liquid to the inside of said cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part 43, and a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply<br>
tube 72 providing a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid<br>
supply path for supplying the cleaning liquid to the inside<br>
of said residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part<br>
46 are inserted.<br>
The starting end of the cleaning liquid supply tube 71<br>
provides a cleaning liquid supply port 71a which opens<br>
substantially at right angles to the axial direction on the<br>
starting end side of the feed tube 60. In addition, at<br>
intermediate points on the feed tube 60 that are opposed to<br>
the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 in the radial direction<br>
inside of the hub 41, openings 71b of the cleaning liquid supply<br>
tube 71 are opened substantially at right angles to the axial<br>
direction. On the other hand, the starting end of the residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid supply tube 72 provides a<br><br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply port 72a which<br>
opens substantially at right angles to the axial direction on<br>
the starting end side of the feed tube 60. In addition, at<br>
intermediate points on the feed tube 60 that are opposed to<br>
the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part 46<br>
in the radial direction inside of the hub 41, openings 72b of<br>
the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply tube 72 are<br>
opened substantially at right angles to the axial direction.<br>
Next, the function of the centrifugal separator 10<br>
according to the first embodiment will be described.<br>
In FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the feed stock is supplied to the inside<br>
of the bowl 20 through the feed tube 60 by use of a pump or<br>
other driving source. The feed stock which is fed from the feed<br>
stock supply port 61 comes from the feed stock outlet port 62<br>
located substantially in the vicinity of the center inside of<br>
the hub 41 of the screw conveyor 40, filling the bowl 20 to<br>
a prescribed level which is preset by the dam part 26 inside<br>
of the bowl 20. The feed stock is subjected to the action of<br>
the centrifugal force inside of the bowl 20, resulting in the<br>
crystals being settled to be separated from the mother liquid.<br>
The crystals settled onto the inner circumferential surface<br>
of the bowl 20 by the action of the centrifugal force are<br>
conveyed to the tapered part 22 of the bowl 20 by the flight<br>
42 of the screw conveyor 40 which is rotated at a speed slightly<br>
different from that of the bowl 20, and are deliquidized while<br>
being moved on the inner circumferential surface of the tapered<br>
part 22, being brought closer to the axis than the liquid level<br>
preset by the dam part 26, before further being conveyed to<br>
the screen part 30.<br>
The crystals deliquidized on the way of being conveyed have<br>
impurities produced in the process of manufacture thereof, and<br>
the mother liquid itself deposited on their surfaces, and the<br>
crystals which have reached the screen part 30 are cleaned by<br>
the cleaning liquid jet spouted from the cleaning nozzle 45<br>
provided in the hub 41. As the cleaning liquid, pure water,<br>
acetic acid solution, pure phenol solution, sulfuric acid<br><br>
solution, hydrochloric acid solution, or the like is generally<br>
used, and the cleaning liquid is supplied to the inside of the<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43 provided inside of the hub<br>
41 through the cleaning liquid supply tube 71 which is<br>
separately inserted into the feed tube 60. The cleaning liquid<br>
received by the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 is passed<br>
through the cleaning liquid connection hole 44 in the<br>
circumferential wall of the hub 41 before being jet spouted<br>
from the cleaning nozzle 45.<br>
The crystals are thus subjected to cleaning and<br>
deliquidization in the screen part 30, and further conveyed<br>
toward the discharge port 24, however, in the clearance between<br>
the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42 of the screw<br>
conveyor 40 and the inner circumferential surface of the screen<br>
part 30, a residual layer of crystals is formed. Such residual<br>
layer crystals are directly and locally cleaned by the cleaning<br>
liquid which is jet spouted from the outer circumferential edge<br>
of the flight 42 through the residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid path, with no relation to said cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part 43. The cleaning liquid used here is often the same as<br>
that which is jet spouted from said cleaning nozzle 45, and<br>
is supplied to the inside of the residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part 46 provided inside of the hub 41 through<br>
the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply tube 72 which<br>
is separately inserted into the feed tube 60.<br>
In details, the cleaning liquid inside of the residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid receiving part 46 is jet spouted into<br>
the inside of the bowl 20 from the cleaning liquid discharge<br>
holes 49 provided inside the wall of the hub 41 or said flight<br>
42, being passed through the connection tubes 47 disposed at<br>
prescribed intervals along the direction of the helix of the<br>
flight 42 in the locations where the inner circumferential<br>
edges of the flight 42 range. The cleaning liquid discharge<br>
holes 49 are radially extended from the inner circumferential<br>
surface side of the hub 41 to the outer circumferential edge<br>
of the flight 42, allowing the cleaning liquid to be directly<br><br>
jet spouted toward the residual layer crystals from the tip<br>
opening of the respective cleaning liquid discharge holes 49<br>
which are opened at the outer circumferential edge of the flight<br>
42.<br>
As described above, besides cleaning of the whole of the<br>
crystals by means of the cleaning nozzles 45, the residual layer<br>
crystals can be locally and directly cleaned in particular by<br>
means of the residual layer crystal cleaning paths, thus no<br>
residual layer crystals are anchored, resulting in the<br>
movability being enhanced, and the penetrability of the<br>
cleaning liquid through the whole of the crystals during<br>
conveying being improved. Therefore, crystal clogging in the<br>
screen part 30 can be prevented; the amount of the cleaning<br>
liquid as that for substitution of the impurities in the<br>
crystals, which is the original application, can be minimized;<br>
and the amount of leakage of the crystals in the screen part<br>
30 can be minimized.<br>
Moreover, the cleaning liquid is separately supplied to the<br>
inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 and the residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part 46, which are<br>
partitioned from each other, thus the amount of the cleaning<br>
liquid which is jet spouted from the cleaning nozzles 45 and<br>
the amount of the cleaning liquid which is jet spouted from<br>
the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid path can be<br>
separately controlled from the external, which allows both<br>
amounts of the cleaning liquid to be easily adjusted to be set<br>
at an optimum value, respectively, for minimization of the<br>
substitution rate for crystal cleaning and the amount of<br>
leakage.<br>
In the screen part 30, the cleaning liquid which has been<br>
jet spouted from the cleaning nozzle 45 and the residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid path is passed through the filtering<br>
medium 31 after cleaning the crystals and the residual layer<br>
crystals, and is discharged from the filtered liquid discharge<br>
holes 25 to the outside of the bowl 20. The crystals which have<br>
been cleaned and deliquidized in the screen part 30 are<br><br>
discharged from the discharge port 24 to the outside of the<br>
bowl 20, and finally recovered from the crystal discharge port<br>
15 provided in the casing 11.<br>
Thus, when the feed stock is supplied to the inside of the<br>
bowl 20, the centrifugal force separates the feed stock into<br>
the object to be treated and the mother liquid inside of the<br>
bowl 20, the object to be treated being settled onto the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the bowl 20, and such object to be<br>
treated is conveyed by the screw conveyor 40 which is provided<br>
with a difference in rotational speed between it and the bowl<br>
20. However, in the radial clearance formed between the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42 of the screw conveyor<br>
40 and the inner circumferential surface of the screen part<br>
30, the object to be treated is not sufficiently conveyed by<br>
the conveyor, forming a residual layer.<br>
The object to be treated deliquidized on the way of being<br>
conveyed generally have impurities produced in the process of<br>
manufacture thereof, and the mother liquid itself deposited<br>
on their surfaces, and in order to remove these surplus<br>
deposited matters, at least a part of the cleaning liquid is<br>
directly jet spouted toward the residual layer crystals formed<br>
in the clearance between the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
flight 42 of the screw conveyor 40 and the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the screen part 30 from the liquid conduction part<br>
in the screen part 30 provided along the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the bowl 20 at the one end side thereof.<br>
Thereby, besides the whole of the object to be treated, the<br>
residual layer crystals formed in the clearance between the<br>
outer circumferential edge of the flight 42 of the screw<br>
conveyor 40 and the inner circumferential surface of said<br>
screen part 30 can be directly cleaned in particular, thus no<br>
residual layer crystals are anchored, resulting in the<br>
movability being enhanced, and the penetrability of the<br>
cleaning liquid through the whole of the object to be treated<br>
during conveying being improved. Therefore, clogging with the<br>
object to be treated in the screen part 30 can be prevented;<br><br>
the amount of the cleaning liquid as that for substitution of<br>
the impurities in the object to be treated, which is the<br>
original application, can be minimized; and the amount of<br>
leakage of the object to be treated in the screen part 30 can<br>
be minimized.<br>
Said liquid conduction part is provided such that, when at<br>
least a part of the cleaning liquid is directly jet spouted<br>
toward the residual layer crystals formed in the clearance<br>
between the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42 of the<br>
screw conveyor 40 and the inner circumferential surface of the<br>
screen part 30 from the liquid conduction part, the thickness<br>
of the residual layer crystals is held to within 10 mm by the<br>
penetration of the cleaning liquid jet spouted from the liquid<br>
conduction part, thus the cleaning liquid effectively passes<br>
through the residual layer crystals, which allows the amount<br>
of leakage of the object to be treated in the screen part 30<br>
to be more effectively reduced. In addition, the tip of at least<br>
a part of the cleaning liquid conduction part is located within<br>
10 mm from the inner surface of the screen part 30, thus the<br>
cleaning liquid effectively passes through the residual layer<br>
crystals, which makes it possible to more effectively reduce<br>
the amount of leakage of the object to be treated in the screen<br>
part 30.<br>
FIG. 4 to FIG. 6 show a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
With a centrifugal separator 10A according to the present<br>
embodiment, a channel 49a which consecutively extends along<br>
the direction of the helix of said flight 42, and to which the<br>
tip opening of said respective cleaning liquid discharge holes<br>
49 is connected is formed in the tip surface of the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42 in the above-described<br>
first embodiment. Specifically, the width of the channel 49a<br>
may be set at 1 to 5 mm or so, and the depth may be set at 10<br>
to 25 mm or so, for example. The portions which are the same<br>
as those in the first embodiment are provided with the same<br>
signs, and a duplicated description thereof is omitted.<br><br>
According to such second embodiment, the cleaning liquid<br>
from the tip opening of said respective cleaning liquid<br>
discharge holes 49 is spread throughout the entire area of the<br>
outer circumferential edge of the flight 42 along the channel<br>
49a. and can be directly jet spouted toward said residual layer<br>
object to be treated such that the cleaning liquid is spread<br>
over the entire circumference in the radial direction. Thereby,<br>
as with said first embodiment, the penetrability of the<br>
cleaning liquid through the crystals, and the movability of<br>
the residual layer crystals can be enhanced.<br>
FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 show a third embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
With a centrifugal separator 10B according to the present<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIG. 7, the respective connection tubes<br>
47 in said residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part 46 are disposed at prescribed intervals along the<br>
direction of the helix of said flight 42 in the locations<br>
adjacent to the surface 42b on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to-be-treated conveying surface 42a of the flight 42,<br>
and in the circumferential wall of said hub 41, cleaning liquid<br>
connection holes 48 to which the respective connection tubes<br>
47 are connected are provided.<br>
And on the surface 42b on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to-be-treated conveying surface 42a of the flight 42<br>
of the screw conveyor 40, a plurality of cleaning liquid<br>
discharge pipes 80 which are each connected to said respective<br>
cleaning liquid connection holes 48. extending in the radial<br>
direction from the inner circumferential edge to the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42, are mounted at<br>
prescribed intervals along the direction of the helix of the<br>
flight 42. Such cleaning liquid discharge pipes 80 provide a<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid path together with the<br>
connection tube 47 and the cleaning liquid connection hole 48.<br>
According to such third embodiment, the cleaning liquid<br>
inside of said residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part 46 passes through the connection tubes 47 which are<br><br>
provided at prescribed intervals along the direction of the<br>
helix of said flight 42 in the locations adjacent to the surface<br>
42b on the side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying<br>
surface 42a of the flight 42, and the cleaning liquid connection<br>
holes 48 provided in the wall of the hub 41 of said screw conveyor<br>
40, being introduced into the cleaning liquid discharge pipes<br>
80 which are provided at prescribed Intervals along the<br>
direction of the helix of said flight 42 on the surface 42b<br>
on the side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying<br>
surface 42a of the flight 42.<br>
The respective cleaning liquid discharge pipes 80 extend<br>
radially from the inner circumferential edge to the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42, and from the tip opening<br>
of the respective cleaning liquid discharge pipes 80 disposed<br>
along the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42, the<br>
cleaning liquid can be directly jet spouted toward said<br>
residual layer object to be treated. According to such a<br>
configuration, the need for work to provide holes in the flight<br>
42 itself is eliminated, and the cleaning liquid discharge<br>
pipes 80 can be post-attached to the flight 42, which allows<br>
the manufacture to be carried out relatively easily. By<br>
radially mounting the respective cleaning liquid discharge<br>
pipes 80 with the narrowest possible spacings, the cleaning<br>
liquid can be jet spouted toward the residual layer crystals<br>
so as to spread over the entire circumference.<br>
FIG. 9 and FIG. 11 show a fourth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A centrifugal separator 10 according to the present<br>
embodiment is a so-called screen bowl type centrifugal<br>
separator, comprising a screw conveyor 40 inside of a<br>
substantially cylindrical type bowl 20, and supporting the<br>
screw conveyor 40 and the bowl 20 such that these are relatively<br>
rotatable, and is configured such that a feed stock supplied<br>
to the inside of said bowl 20 can be separated into the object<br>
to be treated and the mother liquid.<br>
Herein, the object to be treated refers to a variety of<br><br>
crystals, and the like in the chemical industry and the food<br>
industry. and particularly, refers to, for example,<br>
terephthalic acid, which is a raw material for PET bottles and<br>
polyester fabrics, paraxylene, which is a raw material for<br>
terephthalic acid, bisphenol, which is a raw material for<br>
CD-ROM, monosodium glutamate, which is a raw material for<br>
chemical seasonings, and the like. The mother solution refers<br>
to various solvents. With the variety of crystals,<br>
unpolymerized substances and the solvent constituting the<br>
slurry have deposited on their surfaces in the manufacturing<br>
process, and these deposited matters can be<br>
cleaning-substituted by the cleaning liquid (a specific other<br>
solvent, or the like). Hereinbelow, the present embodiment will<br>
be described when it is applied to crystals as an object to<br>
be treated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, the bowl 20 and the screw conveyor 40<br>
inside thereof are rotatably pivotally supported inside of a<br>
casing 11 through shafts 12a, 12b. The bowl 20 and the screw<br>
conveyor 40 are rotation-driven with a minute difference in<br>
speed by a differential gear 14 connected to a bearing 13 on<br>
one side. Such a differential gear 14 itself is well known,<br>
and thus detailed description is omitted.<br>
The inside of the casing 11 is partitioned for providing<br>
a later described discharge port 24 provided for the bowl 20,<br>
a screen part 30, a dam part 26, and the like, respectively.<br>
And, under the casing 11, a crystal discharge port 15 connected<br>
to said discharge port 24, a cleaning liquid discharge port<br>
16 connected to said screen part 30, and a mother liquid<br>
discharge port 17 connected to said dam part 26 are provided,<br>
respectively.<br>
One end side (the right side in FIG. 10) of the bowl 20<br>
provides the direction along which crystals are discharged,<br>
and from the other end side (the left side in FIG. 10) of the<br>
bowl 20, the bowl is partitioned into a parallel cylinder part<br>
21 with a larger diameter, a tapered part 22 which inside<br>
diameter is gradually reduced toward the one end, and a parallel<br><br>
cylinder part 23 with a smaller diameter, in this order. On<br>
the end side of the parallel cylinder part 23 with a smaller<br>
diameter, a crystal discharge port 24 is formed, and on the<br>
end side of the parallel cylinder part 21 with a larger diameter,<br>
a dam part 26 which regulates the liquid level measured along<br>
the radial direction of the bowl 20, and is capable of<br>
discharging the mother liquid after the crystals having been<br>
separated, to the outside of the bowl 20 is provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, the parallel cylinder part 23 with a<br>
smaller diameter has a number of filtered liquid discharge<br>
holes 25 formed in the wall surface, and is covered with a<br>
cylindrical filtering medium 31 over the entire circumference<br>
on the inner circumference side, thus providing the screen part<br>
30. For the size of the filtered liquid discharge hole 25, there<br>
is no need for much consideration about the diameter of the<br>
crystal particles, but the filtering medium 31 is made of a<br>
material having a number of minute holes or slits which diameter<br>
or size is smaller than the particle diameter of the crystals.<br>
Specifically, a wedge wire screen, a porous ceramic molding,<br>
or the like, may be used, for example. The inner circumferential<br>
surface of the parallel cylinder part 23 is cut by the depth<br>
equivalent to the thickness of the filtering medium 31.<br>
The screw conveyor 40 is made up of a hub 41 which provides<br>
an axis of rotation therefor, and a flight 42 which is provided<br>
in the form of a screw on the outer circumference of the hub<br>
41, and the flight 42 is formed such that the crystals are<br>
conveyed toward the one end side (the right side in FIG. 10)<br>
of the bowl 20. Between the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
flight 42 and the inner circumferential surface of the parallel<br>
cylinder part 23 (the surface of the filtering medium 31 of<br>
the screen part 30), a clearance in the radial direction is<br>
provided because the screw conveyor 40 and the bowl 20 are<br>
constructed to be rotated at different speeds.<br>
The hub 41 is provided with a cleaning liquid receiving part<br>
43 which receives the cleaning liquid supplied to the inside<br>
of the hub 41, and a cleaning nozzle 45 which jet spouts the<br><br>
cleaning liquid from the inside of the cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part 43 toward the screen part 30 of said bowl 20.<br>
The cleaning liquid receiving part 43 is made up of a portion<br>
which is surrounded by a partition extending by a prescribed<br>
width in the axial direction around the entire circumference<br>
of the inner circumferential surface of the hub 41.<br>
In the circumferential wall of the hub 41 that provides the<br>
bottom side of the cleaning liquid receiving part 43, a cleaning<br>
liquid connection hole 44 is provided at prescribed intervals,<br>
and on the outer circumferential surface side of the hub 41,<br>
a cleaning nozzle 45 which is connected to said cleaning liquid<br>
connection hole 44 is protruded. Herein, the cleaning nozzle<br>
45 is disposed slightly off the pitch center of the flight 42<br>
toward the other end side (the left side in FIG. 9) and in a<br>
location where it is opposed to the screen part 30 in the radial<br>
direction, as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
Further, inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part 43,<br>
a plurality of residual layer crystal cleaning liquid discharge<br>
holes 52 which are arranged at prescribed intervals along the<br>
direction of the helix of the flight 42 are provided in the<br>
locations adjacent to the surface 42b on the side opposite to<br>
the object-to-be-treated conveying surface 42a of the flight<br>
42. Such residual layer crystal cleaning liquid discharge holes<br>
52 are for directly jet spouting the cleaning liquid inside<br>
of said cleaning liquid receiving part 43 toward the residual<br>
layer crystals on the screen part 30, besides said cleaning<br>
nozzles 45.<br>
Along the outer circumferential edge of the surface 42b on<br>
the side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying<br>
surface 42a of the flight 42, a cover flight 50 with a small<br>
width that extends in the direction of the helix of the flight<br>
42 is mounted with a prescribed spacing being given with respect<br>
to the surface 42b on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to-be-treated conveying surface 42a. The cleaning<br>
liquid springing out from said residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid discharge hole 52 is directly jet spouted toward said<br><br>
residual layer crystals through the clearance between the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42 and the cover flight 50.<br>
The cover flight 50 is disposed, being provided with a slope<br>
with respect to the surface 42b on the side opposite to the<br>
object-to-be-treated conveying surface 42a of the flight 42<br>
such that the clearance is gradually narrowed down from the<br>
side closer to said hub 41 to the side closer to the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42, and is mounted through<br>
supporting plates 51 which are arranged at prescribed intervals<br>
along the direction of the helix of the flight 42.<br>
Into the inside of the hub 41, a feed tube 60 for supplying<br>
the feed stock that extends along the axial direction of the<br>
hub 41 is inserted. The starting end of the feed tube 60 extends<br>
out beyond the hub 41 and the bowl 20, providing a feed stock<br>
supply port 61, and the terminating end of the feed tube 60<br>
is disposed substantially at the center of the inside of the<br>
hub 41, providing a feed stock outlet port 62. Further, into<br>
the inside of the feed tube 60, a cleaning liquid supply tube<br>
71 for supplying the cleaning liquid to the inside of said<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43 is inserted.<br>
The starting end of the cleaning liquid supply tube 71<br>
provides a cleaning liquid supply port 71a which opens<br>
substantially at right angles to the axial direction on the<br>
starting end side of the feed tube 60. In addition, at<br>
intermediate points on the feed tube 60 that are opposed to<br>
the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 in the radial direction<br>
inside of the hub 41, openings 71b of the cleaning liquid supply<br>
tube 71 are opened substantially at right angles to the axial<br>
direction.<br>
Next, the function of the centrifugal separator 10<br>
according to the fourth embodiment will be described.<br>
In FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, the feed stock is supplied to the<br>
inside of the bowl 20 through the feed tube 60 by use of a pump<br>
or other driving source. The feed stock which is fed from the<br>
feed stock supply port 61 of the feed tube 60 comes from the<br>
feed stock outlet port 62 located substantially in the vicinity<br><br>
of the center inside of the hub 41 of the screw conveyor 40,<br>
filling the bowl 20 to a prescribed level which is preset by<br>
the dam part 26 inside of the bowl 20. The feed stock is subjected<br>
to the action of the centrifugal force inside of the bowl 20,<br>
resulting in the crystals being settled to be separated from<br>
the mother liquid.<br>
The crystals settled onto the inner circumferential surface<br>
of the bowl 20 by the action of the centrifugal force are<br>
conveyed to the tapered part 22 of the bowl 20 by the flight<br>
42 of the screw conveyor 40 which is rotated at a speed slightly<br>
different from that of the bowl 20, and are deliquidized while<br>
being moved on the inner circumferential surface of the tapered<br>
part 22, being brought closer to the axis than the liquid level<br>
preset by the dam part 26, before further being conveyed to<br>
the screen part 30.<br>
The crystals deliquidized on the way of being conveyed have<br>
impurities produced in the process of manufacture thereof, and<br>
the mother liquid itself deposited on their surfaces, and the<br>
crystals which have reached the screen part 30 are cleaned by<br>
the cleaning liquid jet spouted from the cleaning nozzle 45<br>
provided in the hub 41. As the cleaning liquid, pure water,<br>
acetic acid solution, pure phenol solution, sulfuric acid<br>
solution, hydrochloric acid solution, or the like is generally<br>
used, and the cleaning liquid is supplied to the inside of the<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43 provided inside of the hub<br>
41 through the cleaning liquid supply tube 71 which is<br>
separately inserted into the feed tube 60. The cleaning liquid<br>
received by the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 is passed<br>
through the cleaning liquid connection hole 44 in the<br>
circumferential wall of the hub 41 before being jet spouted<br>
from the cleaning nozzle 45.<br>
The crystals are thus subjected to cleaning and<br>
deliquidization in the screen part 30, and further conveyed<br>
toward the discharge port 24, however, in the clearance between<br>
the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42 of the screw<br>
conveyor 40 and the inner circumferential surface of the screen<br><br>
part 30, a residual layer of crystals is formed. Such residual<br>
layer crystals are directly and locally cleaned by the cleaning<br>
liquid which is jet spouted from the outer circumferential edge<br>
of the flight 42, besides the cleaning provided by said cleaning<br>
nozzles 45.<br>
In other words, the cleaning liquid inside of the cleaning<br>
liquid receiving part 43 springs out into the inside of the<br>
bowl 20 also from the plurality of residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid discharge holes 52 which are arranged at<br>
prescribed intervals along the direction of the helix of the<br>
flight 42 in the locations adjacent to the surface 42b on the<br>
side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying surface<br>
42a of the flight 42. The cleaning liquid which has sprung out<br>
is directly jet spouted toward said residual layer crystals<br>
through the small clearance between the cover flight 50 mounted<br>
along the outer circumferential edge of the surface 42b on the<br>
side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying surface<br>
42a of said flight 42, and the outer circumferential edge of<br>
the flight 42 without being scattered.<br>
In particular, because the cover flight 50 is mounted, being<br>
provided with a slope with respect to the surface 42b on the<br>
side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying surface<br>
42a of said flight 42 such that the clearance is gradually<br>
narrowed down from the side closer to the hub 41 to the side<br>
closer to the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42, and<br>
is mounted through the supporting plates 51 which are arranged<br>
at prescribed intervals, as shown in FIG. 9, the cleaning liquid<br>
which springs out from the respective residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid discharge holes 52 can be received in a wide<br>
span, and the received cleaning liquid can be directly and<br>
locally jet spouted toward the residual layer crystals from<br>
a narrow span.<br>
As described above, besides cleaning of the whole of the<br>
crystals by means of the cleaning nozzles 45, the residual layer<br>
object to be treated can be locally cleaned as well in<br>
particular, thus no residual layer crystals are anchored.<br><br>
resulting in the movability being enhanced, and the<br>
penetrability of the cleaning liquid through the whole of the<br>
crystals during conveying being improved. Therefore, crystal<br>
clogging in the screen part 30 can be prevented; the amount<br>
of the cleaning liquid as that for substitution of the<br>
impurities in the crystals, which is the original application,<br>
can be minimized; and the amount of leakage of the crystals<br>
in the screen part 30 can be minimized.<br>
In the screen part 30, the cleaning liquid which has been<br>
jet spouted from the cleaning nozzle 45 and the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42 is passed through the<br>
filtering medium 31 after cleaning the crystals and the<br>
residual layer crystals, and is discharged from the filtered<br>
liquid discharge holes 25 to the outside of the bowl 20. The<br>
crystals which have been cleaned and deliquidized in the screen<br>
part 30 are discharged from the discharge port 24 to the outside<br>
of the bowl 20, and finally recovered from the crystal discharge<br>
port 15 provided in the casing 11.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a fifth embodiment of the present embodiment.<br>
With a centrifugal separator 10C according to the fifth<br>
embodiment, said cleaning liquid receiving part 43 is provided<br>
with a partition plate 43a which partitions the inside of the<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43 into two or more in the axial<br>
direction in the screen part 30 of said bowl 20 for allowing<br>
a particular cleaning range in said screen part 30 to be<br>
selected. The portions which are the same as those in the fourth<br>
embodiment are provided with the same signs, and a duplicated<br>
description thereof is omitted.<br>

by the partitioning plate 43a are separately inserted, respectively.<br>
The starting end of the cleaning liquid supply tube 71 provides<br>
a cleaning liquid supply port 71a which opens substantially at right<br>
angles to the axial direction on the starting end side of the feed<br>
tube 60. At intermediate points on the feed tube 60 that are opposed<br>
in the radial direction to one (the left-hand portion in FIG. 12) of<br>
the compartments produced by the partitioning plate 43a inside of the<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43 inside of the hub 41, openings 71b<br>
of the cleaning liquid supply tube 71 are opened substantially at<br>
right angles to the axial direction.<br>
In addition, the starting end of the cleaning liquid supply tube<br>
73 provides a cleaning liquid supply port 73a which opens<br>
substantially at right angles to the axial direction on the starting<br>
end side of the feed tube 60. At intermediate points on the feed tube<br>
60 that are opposed in the radial direction to the other (the right-<br>
hand portion in FIG. 12) of the compartments produced by the<br>
partitioning plate 43a inside of the cleaning liquid receiving part<br>
43 inside of the hub 41, openings 73b of the cleaning liquid supply<br>
tube 73 are opened substantially at right angles to the axial<br>
direction.<br>
The present embodiment is configured such that a single<br>
partition plate 43a partitions the inside of the cleaning liquid<br>
receiving part 43 into two in the axial direction, however, the<br>
number of partitions is, of course, not limited to two as in this<br>
embodiment, but, for example, two partition plates 43a may be<br>
provided for partitioning the inside of the cleaning liquid receiving<br>
part 43 into three in the axial direction, or three partition<br>
plates 43a may be provided for partitioning the inside of the<br>
cleaning liquid receiving part 43 into four in the axial direction.<br>
According to such fifth embodiment, the cleaning liquid<br>
may be supplied to the inside of all the compartments of<br>
the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 through the cleaning liquid<br>
supply path 71 and the cleaning liquid supply path 73 separately<br><br>
provided inside of the feed tube 60 for supplying the feed stock<br>
to the inside of the bowl 20, or the cleaning liquid may be<br>
supplied to the inside of only a part of the compartments.<br>
In such a case, the cleaning liquid is jet spouted toward<br>
the screen part 30 only in the range where it is opposed, in<br>
the radial direction of the bowl 20, to the inside of the<br>
compartment of the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 to which<br>
the cleaning liquid has been supplied. Thereby, according to<br>
the types, and the like, of the crystals, the object to be<br>
treated, and the cleaning liquid, the cleaning range in the<br>
screen part 30 can be selected as appropriate.<br>

As shown in FIG. 13, the respective connection tubes 47 are<br>
disposed at prescribed intervals along the direction of the<br>
helix of said flight 42 in the locations adjacent to the surface<br>
42b on the side opposite to the object-to-be-treated conveying<br>

the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving part 46<br>
that springs out from the residual layer crystal cleaning<br>

The starting end of the cleaning liquid supply tube 71<br>
provides a cleaning liquid supply port 71a which opens<br>
substantially at right angles to the axial direction on the<br>
starting end side of the feed tube 60. In addition, at<br>

the cleaning liquid receiving part 43 in the radial direction<br>
inside of the hub 41, openings 71b of the cleaning liquid supply<br>

direction.<br>
On the other hand, the starting end of the residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid supply tube 72 provides a residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid supply port 72a which opens<br>
substantially at right angles to the axial direction on the<br>
starting end side of the feed tube 60. In addition, at<br>

nozzles 45 and the amount of the cleaning liquid which is jet<br>
spouted from the small clearance between the cover flight 50<br>
and the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42 can be<br>
separately controlled from the external, which allows both<br>

With a centrifugal separator 10E according to the present<br>
embodiment, a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving<br>
chamber 54 which receives the cleaning liquid for cleaning said<br>
residual layer crystals is provided inside of the hub 41 of<br>
said screw conveyor 40 on one side thereof, being partitioned<br>
independently of said cleaning liquid receiving part 43. In<br>
the present embodiment, the residual layer crystal cleaning<br><br>
liquid receiving chamber 54 is provided in the extreme portion<br>
of the hub 41.<br>
On the outer circumference of the hub 41, a plurality of<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes 53<br>
are mounted such that they are arranged at prescribed intervals<br>
in the circumferential direction of the hub 41, being extended<br>
along the axial direction of the hub 41 so as to penetrate<br>
through said flight 42, respectively. In the bottom of said<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving chamber 54,<br>
a residual layer crystal cleaning liquid connection hole 54a<br>
is bored, and the respective residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid introducing tubes 53 are connected, on one side thereof,<br>
to the inside of the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid<br>
receiving chamber 54 through the residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid connection hole 54a, respectively.<br>
The respective residual layer crystal cleaning liquid<br>
introducing tubes 53 are closed on the other side thereof,<br>
however, at intermediate points on the respective residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes 53, a plurality<br>
of residual layer crystal cleaning liquid discharge holes 53a<br>
which are arranged at prescribed intervals along the direction<br>
of the helix of the flight 42 in the locations adjacent to the<br>
surface 42b on the side opposite to the object-to-be-treated<br>
conveying surface 42a of said flight 42 are provided.<br>
The cleaning liquid inside of the residual layer crystal<br>
cleaning liquid receiving chamber 54 that springs out from the<br>
respective residual layer crystal cleaning liquid discharge<br>
holes 53a is directly jet spouted toward said residual layer<br>
crystals from the clearance between said cover flight 50 and<br>
the outer circumferential edge of the flight 42. At an<br>
intermediate point on the feed tube 60 that is opposed to the<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving chamber 54<br>
in the radial direction inside of the hub 41, an opening 72b<br>
of the residual layer crystal cleaning liquid supply tube 72<br>
is opened substantially at right angles to the axial direction.<br>
According to the seventh embodiment as described above, the<br><br>
cleaning liquid which has been supplied to the inside of the<br>
residual layer crystal cleaning liquid receiving chamber 54<br>
is introduced into the respective plurality of residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes 53 arranged on the<br>
outer circumference of the hub 41. And, the cleaning liquid<br>
which has been introduced into the respective residual layer<br>
crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes 53 passes through<br>
the respective plurality of residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid discharge holes 53a which are provided at prescribed<br>
intervals at intermediate points on the respective residual<br>
layer crystal cleaning liquid introducing tubes 53, springing<br>
out into the inside of the bowl 20.<br>
The cleaning liquid which has sprung out into the inside<br>
of the bowl 20 can be directly jet spouted toward said residual<br>
layer crystals through the small clearance between the cover<br>
flight 50 mounted along the outer circumferential edge of the<br>
surface 42b on the side opposite to the object-to-be-treated<br>
conveying surface 42a of said flight 42, and the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the flight 42, without being scattered.<br>
Thereby, the cleaning of the object to be treated by said<br>
cleaning nozzles 45 and the cleaning of the residual layer<br>
crystals by the respective residual layer crystal cleaning<br>
liquid introducing tubes 53 can be separately performed, which<br>
allows the respective cleaning liquids to be rendered different<br>
from each other in type and amount of liquid.<br>
Now, the embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
described with reference to the drawings, and according to<br>
these specific configurations, the penetrability of the<br>
cleaning liquid through the crystals, and the movability of<br>
the residual layer crystals can be enhanced. However, the<br>
present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and any<br>
alterations, modifications, and additions within the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended<br>
claims are, of course, included in the present invention.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br><br>
According to the centrifugal separator pertaining to the<br>
present invention, the cleaning liquid can be directly jet<br>
spouted toward the residual layer object to be treated anchored<br>
to the inner circumferential surface of the screen part from<br>
the outer circumferential edge of the flight of the screw<br>
conveyor, thus the movability of this residual layer is<br>
improved, and the penetrability of the whole of the cleaning<br>
liquid is increased. Therefore, only the residual layer object<br>
to be treated can be locally cleaned to enhance the content<br>
of the liquid in the object to be treated, and thus<br>
solidification of the residual layer can be prevented.<br>
When the cleaning liquid is applied to the whole of the<br>
object to be treated, a part of the object to be treated is<br>
caused to leak in the screen part by the amount which is in<br>
proportion to that of the cleaning liquid passing through the<br>
layer of the object to be treated, and the amount which is in<br>
proportion to the mesh size of the screen part, however, by<br>
jet spouting the cleaning liquid directly toward the residual<br>
layer object to be treated from the outer circumferential edge<br>
of the flight as described above, the solidification of the<br>
residual layer object to be treated is eliminated, and the<br>
penetrability of the cleaning liquid through the object to be<br>
treated during conveying is improved, thus the amount of the<br>
cleaning liquid as that for substitution of the impurities in<br>
the object to be treated, which is the original application,<br>
can be minimized; and the total amount of leakage of the object<br>
to be treated in the screen part can be minimized.<br><br><br>
