	SOLANESOL, SOLANESYL BROMIDE &amp; SOLANESYL ACETONE<br>
NICHOLAS PIRAMAL INDIA LIMITED, a company registered under the Indian Companyies Act 1956 having its registered office located at Nicholas Piramal Tower, Peninsula Corporate Park, Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai 400 013, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
Introduction<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the prepartion of purified solanesol, solanesyl bromide &amp; solanesyl acetone . Solanesyl acetone has the chemical name -all - trans 6, 10, 14,18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38 -nonamethyl -5,9, 13,17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37-triacontanonaen-2-one, and formula -I is used for synthesis of coenzyne Q 10. <br><br><br>
Coenzyme Q10 or COQ 10 with the chemical name as 2- [(all â€“trans) 3, 7,11,15,19,23,27,3l,35,39-decamethyl-2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38 -tetracontadecaenyl]-5,6-dimethoxy -3- methyl -1,4-benzoquinone and formula 1A , is present in virtually in every cell in the human body and is known as the "miracle nutrient". It plays a vital role in maintaining human health and vigor and is involved in mitochondrial processes such as respiration, maintenance of heart muscle strength, enhancement of the immune system, quenching of free radical in the battle against ageing to name a few ( "The miracle nutrient coenzyme" Elsvier/ North - Holland Biomedical Press, New York, 1986; " Coenzyme Q: Bioechemistry, Bioenergetics, and clinical Applications of Ubiquinone" Wiley, New York, 1985; " Coenzyme Q, Molecular Mechanism in Health and Disease" CRC press). COQo comprises the key raw material for chemical synthesis of CoQ10.<br><br><br>

The present invention also provides an improved processes for the purification of solanesol &amp; a process for the preparation of solanesyl bromide and solanesyl acetone<br>

Prior art<br>
C0Q10 of the formula la comprises of a benzoquinone nucleus attached to a side chain with ten isoprene units.<br>
One of the processes for making C0Q10 is to build the side chain comprising often isoprene units and condense with the benzoquinone nucleus. Building up of the side chain is done from solanesol, a naturally occurring alcohol, containing nine isoprene units and having the formula 2<br><br><br><br>
Adding one isoprene unit (five carbons) to solanesol , converts it to decaprenol , of the formula 3, or isodecaprenol of the formula 3i.<br><br><br><br><br>
3	3i<br>
Both the polyprenyl alcohols decaprenol and isodecaprenol contain ten isoprene units and can be used for synthesis of CoQ10.<br>
The processes of adding the 10th isoprene unit comprising of five carbon atoms to solanesol of the formula 2 are the following<br>
Method (I)<br>
Adding a "building block" of five carbon atoms and<br>
Method II)<br>
Adding a "building block" of three carbon atoms to form solanesyl acetone of the<br>
formula 1. which is then added to a building block of two carbon atoms.<br>
3<br><br>
Method I<br>
The Process of adding "building block" of five carbon atoms to solanesol to form decaprenol 3 has been reported in Jingxi Huagong (2000) \1_ (9)549, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Transc. (1981), 761, Tetrahedron 43 5499(19870)). This process comprises of two parts , a) Synthesis of the "building block" and  b) Condensation of the "building block" with solanesol<br>
Method (la) Synthesis of the building block<br>
For adding five carbon atoms the required "building block" is 4-bromo-3-methyl-2-<br>
butenyl acetate of the formula 4.<br>
OCOCH,<br>
The source of the "building block" is prenyl alcohol of the formula 5_(Scheme -la). Prenyl alcohol of the formula (5) is converted by usual method to prenyl acetate of the formula (6)).<br><br><br><br>
t<br><br>
OCOCH,<br><br>
OCOCH,<br><br>
SCHEME-la<br>
Prenyl acetate of the formula (6) is treated with selenium dioxide (20 times molar excess) in the presence of t-butyl hydro peroxide (70% solution), in methylene dichloride and is stirred for 50 hours at room temperature. Excess t-butyl hydro peroxide is destroyed with dimethyl sulphide, and the reaction mixture is then neutralized and concentrated to give the crude aldehyde. The aldehyde of the formula (7) is taken in ethanol/methanol and reduced with sodium borohydride. The reaction<br>
4<br><br>
mixture is quenched in usual way and the crude alcohol 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butenyl acetate of the formula (8) is isolated. The isolated crude alcohol is distilled under vacuum to give the pure product in 30% yield from the acetate of the formula 6. The alcohol is then treated with phoshphorus bromide in the presence of pyridine to form 4-bromo-3-methyl-2- butenyl acetate of the formula (4) in 94% yield. Overall yield of synthesizing the building block from prenyl alcohol 5 is only 20%.<br>
In the above process shown in the Scheme -la, prenols are known to polymerize, selenium dioxide used in molar excess is toxic and also gives rise to an effluent, the handling of which is cumbersome , the number of steps are many and a very low overall yield . All these above factors make the synthesis not suitable for industrial scale production.<br>
lb)       Condensation of "building block" with solanesol shown in Scheme -lb<br><br><br>
OCOCH,<br><br>
3a<br>
Scheme - lb<br>
The first step, in the condensation of "solanesol" with the "building block" of formula 4, is synthesis of solanesyl bromide of the formula 9. Solanesyl bromide is made by the reaction of phosphorus tribromide with solanesol of the formula 2. The general methods in literature involves taking solanesol in ether or a mixture of ether and hexane and reacting with phosphorus tribromide in molar ratio of 0.4 -1.2 at 0-20 Â° C<br>
5<br><br>
in the presence of pyridine in 97% yield. The reaction mixture is then quenched in water, the organic layer separated and washed to neutral, dried over sodium sulphate and solvent evaporated to obtain the product in liquid form which is used without further purification (J. Am. Chem. Society (2002)ja021015v, Jingri Huagong(2000)17(9), 549, Recueil de Travas Chimiques de Payas - Bas 113, 153(1994)).<br>
In the above synthesis of solanesyl bromide of the formula 9 from solanesol uses pyridine, a toxic compound that makes the process not eco friendly. The above process also uses aqueous phase for quenching the reaction mixture and extracts the solanesyl bromide formula 9 formed in a water immiscible solvent.<br>
We observed that quenching in aqueous medium results in the formation of an emulsion in the inter phase between the aqueous and organic phases due to which the separation of the organic phase becomes difficult. Such difficulty results in the loss of the final product causing low yield.<br>
Solanesyl bromide of the formula (9) is reacted with sodium benzene sulphinate in N,N-dimethyl formamide to form Solanesol sulphone of the formula 10 in 95% yield.<br>
In the next step , Solanesol sulphone of the formula JU) is treated with 4-bromo-3-methyl-2- butenyl acetate of the formula' 5 in the presence of potassium tertiary butoxide or n-butyl lithium. The solvent used is N,N dimethyl formamide and a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and hexamethyl phosphoramide respectively. The condensed product of the formula 11 thus formed by the above reaction is purified by column chromatography in 59-89% yield. Treating the compound of the formula U. with sodium amalgam in methanol desulphonates and deprotects it simultaneously to form decaprenol of the formula 3. Desulphonation with sodium amalgam gives rise to 30% positional isomer, of the formula 3a. The crude decaprenol containing mixture of the compounds of the formulae 3 and 3a is then purified by column chromatography to obtain 3 in 50% yield.<br>
According to the above steps, 30% positional isomer is formed which is an unwanted impurity. This has to be removed   by column chromatography which is not only<br>
6<br><br>
difficult    but also expensive to    be carried out for industrial production.    In desulphonation use of sodium amalgum, made from mercury which is poisonous, is unsafe and therefore not recommended for large scale production. Another method of making decaprenol 3 from the condensed product of formula 11. is shown in Scheme lb-(l)<br><br><br>
OCOCHj<br>
11a<br><br>
S02Ph|<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3a<br>
Scheme -lb (1)<br>
In this method the condensed product of the formula 11 is first deprotected followed by desulphonation to form decaprenol compound of formula 3. Deprotection of compound of formula 11 is carried out by hydrolysis of acetate with potassium hydroxide in 80% methanol, to form alcohol of the formula 11a followed by desulphonation with Li/ ethylamine at -78Â° C to yield decaprenol of the formula 3 with 10% positional isomer 3a. The crude mixture containing the compounds of the formulae 3 and 3a is purified by column chromatography to obtain the product of the formula 3 in 50 - 67% yield.<br>
Thus though the positional isomers formed is reduced to 10% from 30% in Scheme lb, desulphonation by Lithium/ ethylamine requires drastic reaction conditions of-78 0 C and producing dry ethylamine, and is not suitable for industry. Preparing decaprenol of the formula 3 from solanesol by the above processes shown in the Schemes lb and Ib-(l) )using a building block of five carbons, results in impurity formation , yield of 40 - 42%, and involves column chromatography and therefore not an ideal process for scale up. Solanesol being an expensive raw material, such low yield makes the process cost ineffective for industrial production.<br>
7<br><br>
Method II.<br>
Adding a "building block" of three carbon atoms to form solanesyl acetone of the formula 1. which is then added to a building block of two carbon atoms.<br>
The source of "building block" of three carbon atoms and two carbon atoms are ethylacetoacetate of the formula 13, and vinyl magnesium bromide of the formula 14 respectively . Both these compounds are commercially available.<br><br>

This method comprises of two parts, a) condensation of solanesol with ethyl acetoacetate to form solanesyl acetone Scheme -IIa and ( b) condensation of solanesyl acetone with vinyl magnesium bromide to form isodecaprenol which is easily converted to decaprenol by converting it to acetate followed by hydrolysis(Scheme -lib)<br>

Comparing the Method I and Method II for making decaprenol / isodecaprenol , the method II comprising Scheme - IIa and Scheme - lib involving solanesyl acetone is simple, with the key raw materials, ethyl acetoacetate and vinyl magnesium bromide, being readily available, less number of steps and no possibility of formation of any positional isomers.<br>
Thus solanesyl acetone would be the preferred intermediate for synthesis of CoQ10 to be used in its synthesis, involving building up of the side chain of ten isoprene units and condensing with the benzoquinone nucleus.<br>
Method of making isodecaprenol and decaprenol from solanesyl acetone using vinyl bromide is reported in Zhurnal organicheskoi Khimii(1988), 24(6), 1172<br>
9<br><br>
Method of preparing CoQ10from isodecaprenol is given in Chemistry Letters<br>
1597(1988), and from<br>
decaprenol is described and claimed in our copending patent application no 805/MUM/2005<br>
The literature method of making solanesyl acetone is as follows.<br>
The solanesyl acetone is made by treating solanesyl bromide of the formula 9 with ethyl acetoacetate of the formula 13 in the presence of sodium &amp; ethanol at 60Â°C to produce solanesyl acetate of the formula 14. The solanesyl acetate is hydrolysed and decarboxylated with 10% sodium hydroxide solution at 60Â°C to solanesyl acetone of the formula 1. Recueil de Travas Chimiques de Payas - Bas 113,153(1994).<br>
We observed that the reaction of solanesyl bromide in such a protic polar solvent &amp; sodium ethoxide gives rise to side reactions such as side chain cyclisation, thereby decreasing the purity of solanesyl acetone produced. The purity of the solanesyl acetone so produced is not more than 65- 70% by HPLG. Continuing with the said purity in its further reaction would result in the production of impure CoQ10, with a heavy loss in purification, thereby making the process of synthesis of CoQ10 cost ineffective.<br>
Scope of clinical application of coenzyme CoQ10 is becoming wider with its increasing broadband use. An industrially viable, cost effective synthesis of CoQ10 is presently lacking. With our experience in this area, we observed that an improved process for the preparation of coenzyme CoQ10 can be developed, if the process for the preparation of Solanesyl acetone, an important starting material for the preparation of coenzyme CoQ10, is improved, overcoming the drawbacks of the hitherto known processes.<br>
The major cost-contributing factor for the preparation of CoQ10, is the cost of solanesol. Solanesol is obtained from natural sources namely tobacco and potatoes. The content of Solanesol in tobacco is very less (
10<br><br>
major problem faced in the industry is the quality of solanesol. Solanesol obtained from commercial source has unwanted residue, and needs purification.<br>
Solanesyl bromide is the first required intermediate in Method II(Scheme Ha), as discussed above. Therefore, it is essential that the purity of solanesol be maintained in its conversion to solanesyl bromide. Any decrease in purity of solanesyl bromide would affect the subsequent purity of solanesyl acetone of the formula I . Solanesyl bromide being allylic bromide, its chromatographic purification is ruled out and its low melting point bars the crystallization technique. In short, a clean method of preparation of solanesyl bromide with maximum yield &amp; purity is the need of the hour.<br>
The present invention has been developed on the basis of our findings that Solanesol can be purified by crystallization and its conversion to solanesyl bromide and solanesyl acetone by improved processes , these processes being novel and not reported in the literature.<br>
Objectives of the present invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is toprovide an improved process for the purification of solanesol more than 90%<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of solanesyl bromide, an important starting material for the preparation of coenzyme C0Q10, circumventing problems of formation of emulsion in the hitherto known processes<br>

-Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the purification<br>

which comprises,<br>
(i) Subjecting crude solanesol to column chromatography using a gradient solvent<br>
system selected from non polar to polar or a mixture thereof,<br>

(iv) cooling the supernatant obtained in step (iii) to a temperature in the range of -<br>
30 to room temperature to get pure (above 90 %) solanesol<br>
The above method of purification of solanesol uses a combination of column chromatography and crystallization.  The crystallization of solanesol  in solvent<br>
12<br><br>
comprising of separating the insoluble by decanting the supernatant from the solution, followed by crystallization is not reported in literature , and therefore novel. The above method improves the purity of solanesol from 75% to about 90%.<br>

(iii)     separating the organic phase and<br>
(iv)     evaporating to get solanesyl bromide of the formula 9<br>
In the above mentioned process for making solanesyl bromide improvements are effected by carrying out the bromination reaction by using alkyl amine as an acid scavenger, as against prior art which uses pyridine. Alkyl amines are non toxic, environment friendly, economical and therefore commercially viable. Alkyl amines are not used in prior art for making solanesyl bromide and therefore novel.<br>
