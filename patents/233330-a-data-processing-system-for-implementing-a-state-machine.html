				<td>The   present  invention  relates   to   a  data  processing   system  for implementing a state machine.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
A state machine specifies the sequences of states that an object or an interaction goes through during its lifetime in response to events, together with its responses to those events. State machine models are particularly suited for modelling certain systems, such as automated voice-prompting telephone answering systems, traffic light systems, electronic circuits etc.<br>
Currently available computer languages are generally purely procedurally based (eg. C/C++, Pascal, Java, Basic).  To implement a state tree definition a programmer must create a state machine thai executes the states. This can be time consuming utilising currently available computer languages and the solution may not be reusable.<br>
Certain applications have been developed for creating state machines but they are generally limited to particular applications and/or complex and/or time consuming to implement<br>
US5485600 discloses a visual modelling system for defining<br><br>
relationships between objects. The relationships may be defined utilising a state table. A user is required to set up the environment for each state table, edit the state table for the particular application and then generate a program utilising information from the state table   The state table is utilised as a tool to generate a program utilising a pre-existing language There is no suggestion that programming may be effected directly via a state machine programming language   The programming method disclosed in this patent is time consuming and.laborious to implemenLand does not facilitate the reuse of programming code.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a state machine programming language that allows a programmer to program directly according to a state machine model that clearly defines the structure of a state machine or to at least provide the public with a useful choice<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of computer programming utilising a state machine programming language including the steps of;<br>
defining a plurality of states according to the syntax of the state machine programming language, each state having state definition information including:<br>
i.    a definition of each action to be executed upon transition to that state; and<br>
ii.    a definition of each event which will cause transition to another state and the name of the next state to which operation will progress; whereinJunctions called by actions are defined separately from the state definitions<br>
According to a further aspect there is provided a data processing system<br>
including;<br>
a storage device containing state information according to the syntax of a<br>
state machine programming language including<br>
definitions for a plurality of states in which each state definition includes; i     a definition of each action to be executed upon transition to that state;<br>
and ii     a definition of each event which will cause transition to another state<br>
and the next state to which operation will progress and iii.    a processor which executes the actions in accordance with the state information for the current state and effects state transitions in response to event information wherein functions called by actions are defined separately from the state definitions<br>
According to a further aspect ther^ is provided a computer programmed to operate according to a state based programming language wherein to create a program the computer requires a user to enter state information according to a required syntax for each state including; i    a state name;<br>
ii    actions to be executed upon transition to the state; and iii.   each event which will cause transition to another state and the name of the next state; wherein functions called by actions are defined separately from the state information<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention will now be descnbed by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;<br>
Figure 1;      shows a simple state machine<br>
Figure 2;      shows a computer system suitable for executing the state machine programming language of the invention<br>
Figure 3:      shows a state machine for implementing an automated voice-prompting telephone answering system<br>
Detailed Description of the Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring to Figure 1 a graphical representation of a state machine is shown.  From an initial State 0 operation may progress to a first State 1-Whilst in State 1 certain actions mav be executed   Upon the occurrence of an Event 1 operation may progress to State 2 where another set of actions may be performed   Upon the occurrence of Event 2 operation may proceed to State 3 where a further set of actions may be executed.  Upon the occurrence of Event 3 operation may return to State 2 o', upon occurrence of Event 4 operation may proceed to State 4 where a further set of actions may be executed.  Operation may then terminate at a final State 5<br>
Although state models have been used to model sequential processes, state diagrams and tables have merely been utilised as a tool to develop a resulting program<br>
According to the present invention a state machine language has been developed whereby a programmer may structure a program in the state machine language in a manner reflecting the logical operation within a state machine diagram<br>
Accordina to the invention a machine base programming language is provided which separates state definitions; from procedural code and treats the procedural code as an adjurtct to the main stats-handling code   This allows a programmer to clearly define the structure of a state machine and simplifies the writing and maintaining of programs to implement state machines.<br>
According to the state machine language of the invention each state is given an unique state name by the programmer; the actions to be executed whilst the program is in that state are defined and the events causing the program to progress to a new state along witli the new state are also defined. The format for defining each state is as iaelow.<br>
State Name<br>
actions<br>
Function call 1<br>
Function call 2<br>
Function call n events<br>
event 1; next state 1<br>
event 2: next state 2<br>
event n: next state n end<br>
One or more action may be defined for each state   A number of states may execute the same action. One or more event may trigger a transition to a new state.  Different events may trigger transitions to different states<br>
Each state is preferably defined within a block of code   Each state definition is preferably separated from each other state definition by a blank line.<br>
The actions defined within each state definition may be common functions which may be defined within a "functions" definition.  This may be conveniently provided at the end of the state definitions<br>
The events that may trigger a state transition may be inputs from input devices, the outputs of function calls etc   Any function may execute<br>
any other function which will, when executed, return to the calling parent function. A function is represented by its name, its interface and a set of instructions defining the functions operation as follows<br>
Function name<br>
Interface<br>
Instructions defining the function's operation<br>
Within a state machine it may be desirable to identify a portion of the state tree as a.sub-branch. When operation proceeds to the sub-branch operation may proceed according to the sub-branch state definition until operation proceeds to the final state of the sub-branch, whereupon operation then returns to the parent state tree definition.  This approach may be applied to any sub-branch depth.  Accordingly, for example, the state diagram shown in figure 1 may represent a sub brancli of a larger state diagram.  The section of definitions for states 1-4 may be identified as a sub-branch   Such a sub-branch may be called as an action for a state of the parent state tree definition. This may enable commonly used sub-branches to be defined once and to be used by any parent state   This allows state definitions to be compact, simple, easy to understand and better structured   This approach is analogous to a parent function calling another child function that returns back to the calling parent when it is finished.<br>
Referring now to figures 2 and 3 a computer for implementing the state machine language of the invenlJo.Di§ described in coniunction with an automated voice prompting telephone answering system application by way of example only<br>
Referring to figure 2 the computer may be of standard arctiitecture including a microprocessor 6 which receives input from an input device 7 such as a keyboard. FIAM 8 provides temporary data storage and hard disk drive 9 provides permanent storage. An operating system<br>
and the state machine language program may be stored on hard disk 9 and loaded into RAM dunng operation. Processor 6 outputs graphics information to graphics driver 10 which drives display 11   Typically a use» will type in a code which will be displayed by display 11, stored on hard disk drive 9 and executed by processor 6<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a state machine diagram for a tephone voice prompting system for accessing departments of a business    From Initial State 20 operation proceeds to state 21 where a caller is asked whether operator assistance is required. If "0" is pressed operation proceeds to State 22 and the call is connected to an operator   If a "1" is pushed operation proceeds to State 23.  If "1" is selected the call is connected to gardening in State 24.  If key "2" is selected operation proceeds to step 25 and the call is connected to the service desk. Once the required functions are executed in states 22, 24 and 25 operation proceeds to final state 26. If any invalid key is selected in State 23 operation proceeds to step 27 and returns to State 23<br>
The following is a possible implementation of such a system utilising the state machine language of the invention<br>
The first state is always the start state for the machine<br>
State AsklfOperatorRequired<br>
actions<br>
SendPrompt ("Press 0 to contact an operator or 1<br>
for a list of departments"), event<br>
"0"	ConnectCallToOperator,<br>
"1"	SelectDepartment<br>
end<br>
State ConnectCallToOperator actions<br>
SendMessage ("Connecting to the operatof'),<br>
ConnectCall ( Operator), event<br>
default:	FINAL STATE;<br>
end<br>
State SelectDepartment actions<br>
SendPrompt ("Please select the number of the department you are interested in or * to talk to tlie operator"); event<br>
'1' ; ConnectCallToGardening,<br>
'2';   ConnectCallToServiceDesk,<br>
'*"   ConnectCallToOperator,<br>
default.   InvalidDepartment, end<br>
State   ConnectCallToGardening actions<br>
SendMessage ("Connecting to the Gardening department"):<br>
ConnectCall ( Gardening), event<br>
default:  FINAL_STATE, end<br>
State ConnectCallToServiceDesk<br>
actions<br>
SendMessage ("Connecting to the Service Desk").<br>
ConnectCall (ServiceDesk); event<br>
default: FINAL^STATE: end<br>
State InvalidDepartment action<br><br>
Send Message ("Sorry, no such depaitment number");<br>
Desk"), event<br>
default   SelectDepartment; end<br>
FUNCTIONS<br>
function ConnectCall (department)<br>
{<br>
ExtensionNumber - lookup (department) RouteVoiceCall (ExtensionNumber);<br>
}<br>
function SendPrompt (prompt)<br>
{<br>
VoiceCotent - ConvertToVoice (prompt)<br>
SendVoice (VoiceContent):<br>
Key - GetUserResponse(),<br>
Return key; }<br>
function SendMessage (message)<br>
{<br>
VoiceContent = ConvertToVoice (message), SendVoice (Voice Content),<br>
In this example the first state "AsklfOperatorRequired" is the initial state The action definition for this state includes the "SendF^rompf function This function is defined at the end of the programme definition whicli instructs the content to be converted to voice.  The bracketed content "press "0" to contact an operator or "1" for a list of departments" will thus be sent as a voice message to the caller.   In the<br>
event definition the event of pressing key "0" results in a transition to state ConnectCallToOperator and pressing "1" results in a transition to the state SelectDepartment. The other state definitions are likew/ise defined by their names, actions and the events (each event having an associated next state)<br>
The functions are defined by their name (eg "ConnectCall") interface (eg Department) and instructions (eg ExtensionNumber = lookup (department); RouteVoiceCall (ExtensionNumber)<br>
By way of comparison the following code is an example of an implementation of the state machine diagram of figure 3 writien in a procedural programming language<br>
program VoicePrompter () begin<br>
currentState = AsklfOperatorRequired While currentState != FiNAL_STATE do begin<br>
key = GetUserKey() select CurrentState of<br>
case AsklfOperatorRequired :<br>
{<br>
key = SendPrompt ("Press 0 to contact  an operator or 1 for a list of departments"' if key = "0' then<br>
CurrentState = ConnectCallToOperator, Else<br>
CurrentState = SelectDepartment,<br>
}<br>
case ConnectCallToOperator;<br>
{<br>
SendMessage ("Connecting to the<br>
CurrentState = F-INAL_STATE, ConnectCall ( Operator)<br>
}<br>
case SelectDepartment;<br>
}<br>
Key = Sendprompt { "Please select the number of the department you are interested in or * to talk to the operator"):<br>
If key = '1' then CurrentState -ConnectCallToGardening, Else If key = '2' then<br>
CurrentState = ConnectCallToServiceDesk; Else If key = '*' then<br>
CurrentState = ConnectCallToOperator; Else<br>
CurrentState = Invalid Department;<br>
}<br>
case ConnectCallToGardening:<br>
{<br>
SendMessage ("Connecting to the Gardening department");<br>
CurrentState = FINAL_STATE; ConnectCall ( Gardening ),<br>
}<br>
case ConnectCallToServiceDesk:<br>
}<br>
SendMessage ("Connecting to the Service<br>
Desk'):<br>
CurrentState = FINAL_STATE, Con;nectCall (ServiceOesk);<br>
case InvalidDepartment<br><br>
{<br>
number");<br>
SelectDepartment:<br>
} end case end while end program<br><br>
SendMessage ("Sorry, no sucli department CurrentState -<br><br>
function ConnectCall (department)<br>
{<br>
ExtensionNumber - lookup (department); RouteVoiceCall (ExtentionNumber);<br>
function SendPrompt (prompt)<br>
{<br>
VoiceContent = ConvertToVoice (prompt), SendVoice (VoiceContent); Key = GetUserResponser (), Return (key).<br>
function SendMessage (message) {<br>
VoiceConent = ConvertToVoice (message), SendVoice (VoiceContent),<br>
}<br>
It will be noted that the state information is buried amongst procedural control statements and the states, actions and transitions ot the state machines are difficult to discern.<br>
It will thus be seen that the invention provides a state machine language which allows a programmer to clearly define the structure cf a state machine, and thus facilitate the writing and maintaining of programs implementing state machines   The syntax of the state machine language of the invention allows states and transitions to be explicitly defined, making the state machine structure readily discernible   This greatly simplifies writing and maintaining programs written in the state machine language of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
