PUSH-BUTTON OPERATED ROCKER SWITCH<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to electrical switches and, more particularly, to push-button operated<br>
electrical switches. More specifically, this invention relates to push-button switches comprising<br>
a rocker switching mechanism.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrical switches are essential, if not indispensable, in electrical applications such as<br>
electrical appliances, apparatus and installations. Among the various type of known switches,<br>
push-button switches and rocker switches are probably the most widely used. A rocker switch<br>
typically comprises a rocker member which can be toggled between at least two alternative<br>
stable operating positions corresponding to different alternative operation modes. A push-<br>
button switch typically comprises a linearly actuated push-button which is operated by a<br>
sequence of simple linear motions, e.g. by pushing down and then releasing a push-button.<br>
Push-button actuated switches comprising a rocker-type switching mechanism are known.<br>
However, the actuation force characteristics of known push-button actuated rocker switches are<br>
not satisfactory due to the inherent actuation force characteristics of a rocker switch. For<br>
example, as can be seen from Fig. 1A which shows a characteristics actuation force diagram of<br>
a conventional rocker switch such as that shown in Fig. 1, a stepped actuation force has to be<br>
applied in order to overcome the inertia of a spring biased rocker member which is typically an<br>
integral part of a rocker switch. A resistive force, which results as a reaction to the actuation<br>
force, will be felt by a user. This resistive force will disappear well before the rocker switch has<br>
moved into the next stable operation mode due to the inherent spring bias of the rocker switch.<br>
Push-button actuated switches with a rocker switching mechanism as the switching core<br>
are also known. In this specification, such switches will be referred to as a "push-button<br>
actuated rocker switch" for convenience. A conventional push-button actuated rocker switch<br>
comprises an actuation push button which is spring biased such that the push button is returned<br>
to its spring neutral position after each operating push. The push button is typically designed so<br>
that the push button will encounter the rocker member after it has travelled for a pre-determined<br>
distance towards the rocker.<br>
When the operating modes of a conventional push button actuated rocker switch are to be<br>
changed, a user will have to push the push-button until the rocker switch is toggled. Typically,<br>
the initial push is light and smooth and the initial resistive force experienced by a user is an<br>
incremental resistive force of the biasing spring. After the push button has travelled for a<br>
predetermined distance, it will encounter the rocker and the inertia of the rocker will have to be<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/076870	PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
overcome if the rocker is to be driven into the next operating mode. At this encounter, the user<br>
will detect an abrupt increase in resistive force. The resistive force due to the rocker will<br>
gradually decrease and will disappear when the rocker has reached a critical threshold position<br>
beyond which the rocker will automatically move into the next operating mode without requiring<br>
further or additional toggling forces.<br>
This abrupt or stepped increase of resistive force characteristics gives a user a rugged feel<br>
which is frequently disliked. Therefore, it will be desirable if switches which mitigate the<br>
aforementioned rugged feel can be provided. As most switches are to be fitted on fixtures, such<br>
as sockets or wall-plates, of a standard- or a predetermined size, it would be of additional<br>
benefits if switches with improved actuation feel can have a compact design so that the<br>
improved switches can be fitted on existing or standard fixtures. However, as a rocker switch is<br>
operated by toggling a rocker member about its pivotal axis while a push button is typically a<br>
linearly moving device which is movable along a longitudinal axis which is substantially<br>
orthogonal to the pivotal axis of the rocker member, providing an interfacing means or<br>
mechanism between the push button and the rocker switch while maintaining a compact design<br>
posies a challenge.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object, of the present invention to provide push-button actuated rocker<br>
switching means, especially push-button actuated rocker switches with resistive force<br>
characteristics which alleviate shortcomings of conventional designs. It is also an ancillary<br>
object of the invention to provide a drive interfacing means or mechanism for operating a rocker<br>
switch by a push button. At a minimum, it is an object of this invention to provide the public with<br>
a useful choice of electrical switches with a push-button actuated rocker switching mechanism.<br>
Broadly speaking, this invention teaches a push-button actuated rocker switch comprising a<br>
drive conversion means which converts a push-button motion into a reciprocating motion for<br>
driving a rocker switching mechanisms and provided with improved resistive force<br>
characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an electrical switch which comprises a push-button, a rocker<br>
switching mechanism having a rocker member, resilient urging means, and drive conversion<br>
means for converting motion of the push button into motion suitable for changing the operation<br>
modes of the rocker switching mechanism, wherein, the drive conversion means operates as an<br>
interface between the push-button and the rocker member whereby switching modes of the<br>
rocker switching mechanism can be changed by the drive conversion means in response to<br>
motion of the push button, the resilient urging means is disposed between the push-button and<br>
the rocker switching mechanism and is adapted for providing a resilient resistive force against<br>
motion of the push button towards the rocker member, for returning the push button towards a<br>
2 <br>
WO 2006/076870	PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
spring neutral or zero displacement position and for providing an additional resilient resistive<br>
force to the drive conversion means whereby differential actuation force required to overcome<br>
inertia of the rocker member in order to bring the rocker member into a switching motion is<br>
reduced.<br>
Such a resilient urging means operates to help to reduce the apparent height of the step of<br>
actuation force required to overcome the inertia of the rocker switching mechanism in order to<br>
bring the rocker member into toggling motion. The resilient urging means facilitates this by<br>
gradually increasing resistance before the rocker member is encountered.<br>
Preferably, the resilient resistive force exerted by the resilient urging means on the push<br>
button is incremental when the push-button is moving from the zero displacement position<br>
towards the rocker member, the rate of increase of the resilient resistive force is higher when<br>
the push button is nearer the rocker member and is lower when the push button is nearer the<br>
zero displacement position. The two-stage resilient resistance force will provide a user with a<br>
useful indication or feedback of how close the push button is to the toggling position.<br>
Preferably, the additional resilient resistive force of the resilient urging means operates to<br>
return the drive conversion means towards a neutral position which is away from the position at<br>
which the switching mode of the rocker switching mechanism will toggle.<br>
Preferably, the additional resilient resistive force is positive when the push button is moving<br>
towards the rocker member and before the drive conversion means encounters the rocker<br>
member, the resilient resistive force is negative after the drive conversion means has<br>
encountered the rocker member and after inertia of the rocker member has been overcome.<br>
The negative force helps to return the drive conversion means and the push button to its zero-<br>
displacement position, since, once inertia has been overcome, the feel of an actual resistance is<br>
no longer important for most practical purposes.<br>
Preferably, the resilient resistive force is negative and decremental after inertia of the rocker<br>
has been overcome but before the rocker member is driven into a position at which switching<br>
mode changing will occur without additional external actuation force.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the drive conversion means comprises a pendulum member<br>
which is pivotally movable about a pivotal axis, the pendulum member comprises a drive head<br>
which is pivotally movable about the pivotal axis between positions at which the switching<br>
modes of the rocker switching mechanism change. The pendulum member is at its pivotal<br>
neutral position when the push button is at its spring neutral position. At this pivotal neutral<br>
position, the pendulum member is intermediate positions at which the rocker switching<br>
mechanism will toggle.<br>
Preferably, the pivotal axis of the pendulum member is substantially orthogonal to the<br>
direction of movements of the push button.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, the resilient urging means comprises primary and secondary<br>
resilient urging means, the primary resilient urging means is adapted for returning the push<br>

WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
button towards its spring neutral or zero displacement position and the secondary resilient<br>
urging means is adapted for returning the drive conversion means towards a pivotally neutral<br>
position which is intermediate positions at which the switching modes of the rocker switching<br>
mechanism will be changed by the drive conversion means.<br>
Preferably, the secondary resilient urging means begin to participate to provide additional<br>
resilient resistive force to the push button after the push-button has moved for a predetermined<br>
displacement from a neutral position towards a toggling position but before the drive conversion<br>
means encounters the rocker member, the toggling position is one at which no further external<br>
force is required to change the operation modes of the rocker switching mechanism.<br>
Preferably, the urging resistance against motion of the push-button towards the rocker<br>
member is incremental after no additional force is required to change the operation modes of<br>
said rocker switching mechanism.<br>
Preferably, the resilient urging means comprises first and second spring urging means, the<br>
first spring urging means operates to return the push button to its zero displacement position<br>
and the second spring urging means is adapted for exerting urging resistance against the push-<br>
button after the first spring urging means has already acted against the push-button for a pre-<br>
determined displacement towards but before reaching a position at which the operating modes<br>
of the rocker switching mechanism are changed.<br>
Preferably, the first and second spring urging means are adapted for providing incremental<br>
resistance against said push-button when the push-button is moving towards a position at which<br>
the operating mode of the rocker switching mechanism are changed and before resistance of<br>
the rocker switching mechanism is encountered.<br>
Preferably, the resistive force of the first spring urging means is reactive and substantially<br>
parallel to direction of the applied actuating force of the push-button, the resistive force of the<br>
second spring urging means is at an acute angle to the applied actuating force.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the first spring urging means comprises a pair of resiliently<br>
deformable legs which are substantially symmetrically disposed about the axis of the push-<br>
button and which provide a resistive force against the linear actuation motion of the push-button.<br>
Preferably, the second spring urging means is resiliently deformed away from the rocker<br>
member of the rocker switching mechanism after the drive conversion means has encountered<br>
the rocker member and the resilient deformation of the second spring urging means operates to<br>
resist pivotal movement of the drive conversion means after the push-button has moved for a<br>
pre-determined displacement towards the rocker member.<br>
Preferably, the drive conversion means comprises a pendulum-like driving member or<br>
pendulum member having a pivoted end and a swivable end, the swivable end of the driving<br>
member is pivotally movable relative to the pivoted end, the swivable end of the driving member<br>
and the rocker member of the rocker switching mechanism are co-operatively configured so that<br>

4<br><br>
WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
to actuation motion of the push-button, the swivable end will be rotated towards a actuation<br>
position, whereby said the rocker member will be driven towards a position at which the<br>
operation modes of the rocker switching mechanism will be changed.<br>
Preferably, the rocker member is pivotally movable about a rocker axis, the rocker member<br>
comprise a pair or protruding arms which are symmetrical about the rocker axis, the pendulum-<br>
like driving member comprises a pair of driving heads which are symmetrical about the pivoted<br>
end, the driving heads of the drive conversion member and the protruding arms of the rocker<br>
member are arranged so that the protruding arms of the rocker member are alternatively driven<br>
by the corresponding driving heads for toggling the operating modes of the rocker switching<br>
mechanism.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A typical rocker switch 100 is shown in Fig. 1. The rocker switch comprises a rocker<br>
member 110 and a switching mechanism. The rocker member is configured and disposed so<br>
that it can drive a movable electrical contact of the switching mechanism into at least a first<br>
operating position and a second operating position so that first and second alternative<br>
connections can be made. Of course, rocker switches can have more than two operating<br>
modes. The rocker member 110 is pivotally mounted about a rocker axis 130 and is under<br>
internal spring bias so that, once the rocker member is moved to a critical threshold position, the<br>
internal spring bias will cause the rocker member to move into the next operating mode without<br>
additional external forces. After the rocker member has been moved into an operating mode, it<br>
will stay in that operation mode unless its operation mode is further toggled.<br>
Fig. 1A shows a typical actuation force-displacement diagram of a conventional rocker<br>
switch. As shown in the Figure, the maximum actuation force occurs when an actuation force is<br>
initially applied to overcome inertia of the spring biased rocker member of the rocker switch.<br>
This maximum actuation force is required to bring about initial movements of the rocker member<br>
about its pivotal or rocker axis so that the rocker member will move pivotally from a neutral<br>
position to a toggling position at which the operating modes of the rocker switch will be changed.<br>
The subsequent follow-on force which is required to bring the rocker member to the toggling<br>
position, or to complete the operation mode change, gradually decreases and becomes<br>
negligible when a critical threshold position has reached. Once this critical threshold position is<br>
reached, the internal spring bias of the rocker member will take over to complete toggling and<br>
no additional external force is required to cause the rocker member to completely change its<br>
operating positions. In the force diagram shown, force FN represents the characteristic<br>
minimum vertical actuation force required to move the push-button downwards at distance D.<br>
Electrical switches comprising push-button actuated rocker switching mechanism are<br>
known. Such switches typically comprise a push-button, a rocker switching mechanism and<br>
drive conversion means for interconnecting the push-button and the rocker member of the<br>
rocker switching mechanism. The drive conversion means is also provided for converting linear<br>
motion of the push-button into a rotational or pivotal motion for driving the rocker member into<br>
different operation positions. For a conventional push button rocker switch, the resistive force<br>
which a user will feel or encounter in the course of changing the operating modes of the switch<br>
is generally as shown in Fig. 10A. It is apparent from Fig. 10A that there is a steep or stepped<br>
increase of resistive force when the rocker is initially encountered.<br>
In the force diagram of Fig. 10A, the entire displacement range of the push-button of the<br>
electrical switch of Fig. 9 is represented by 0 to d4. The positions 0 and d4 correspond<br>
respectively to the zero and the maximum displacements of the push-button. The positions are<br>
sometimes respectively referred to as the rest and fully depressed positions. As is apparent<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
from this force diagram, when a user pushes the push button 210 towards the rocker member<br>
so as to cause change of operation modes, the user can feel a gradually increasing resistance<br>
until the push-button has displaced for a pre-determined distance d1. At this position d1, the<br>
drive conversion means encounters the rocker member and the resistive inertia of the rocker<br>
has to be overcome if the rocker member is to be moved into the next stable operating position.<br>
This inertia overcoming force is an abrupt step, as shown at d2 of Fig. 10A. As a result, a user<br>
will experience an abrupt or stepped increase in resistive force. The resistive force will<br>
gradually decrease between displacement positions d2 and d3 and will resume a positive slope<br>
(i.e., incremental) at the displacement point d3 when the critical threshold position has been<br>
passed. This is because, at d3, the biasing spring for returning the push button to its neutral<br>
position takes over and will appear as the residual resistive force. This biasing spring force will<br>
appear until the push-button has completed its entire displacement range at position d4.<br>
In the description below, common numerals will be used to refer to parts which are common<br>
or equivalent unless the context otherwise requires.<br>
In Figs. 2 to 9, a first preferred embodiment of a push button rocker switch 10 is shown.<br>
The electrical switch 10 comprises a rocker switching mechanism 100, a push-button means<br>
comprising a button interfacing cap 200, a resilient urging assembly 300, drive conversion<br>
member 400 and a main housing 500. Although the various parts in the switch of this example<br>
are accommodated in the main housing 500 for convenient mounting and insulation, it will be<br>
appreciated that the switch may be mounted as part of an apparatus or equipment.<br>
The rocker switch 100 can be of a conventional design, for example, a rocker switch of<br>
Fig.1. Of course, other appropriate or new rocker switches from time to time available can be<br>
utilised without loss of generality. Similar to a rocker switch of Fig. 1, the rocker switch 100<br>
comprises a rocker member 110 and a contact actuated rocker switching assembly. The<br>
contact actuated rocker switching assembly, or rocker switching mechanism in short, comprises<br>
an electrical contact member 120 which is operable to facilitate the making or breaking of a<br>
plurality of alternative electrical circuit connections. The specific connections are typically<br>
dependent on the instantaneous stable positions of the rocker member 110. For example, two<br>
or three alternative circuit connections can be provided by a single rocker switching mechanism.<br>
A spring assembly is typically provided in a rocker switch. This spring assembly is provided<br>
for urging the electrical contact member of the rocker member to remain in the stable operation<br>
position once it has been moved into that position. The spring assembly also serves a dual<br>
function of moving the contact member into the next operating position once the rocker member<br>
has been moved to the critical threshold position. Typically, the spring assembly comprises a<br>
coil spring 140 which is fitted inside a hollow body of the rocker member with its axis<br>
substantially normal to the rocker axis 130. Of course, other resilient urging means can serve<br>
the same or equivalent purposes.<br>

The rocker member 110 comprises a rocker body 111 with a pair of rocker arms 112. The<br>
rocker arms 112 are symmetrically disposed about the neutral pivotal axis of the rocker body.<br>
The lateral end of each of the rocker arms protrudes upwardly from the rocker body and<br>
extends towards the push-button.<br>
The push-button means comprises a push button member and a button interfacing cap 200.<br>
The button interfacing cap 200 comprises a main body with a contact surface 210. The upper-<br>
side and lower side of the contact surface 210 are respectively for interacting with the push<br>
button member and for transmitting downward movements of the push button member through<br>
to the rocker member. The main body of the button interfacing cap 200 provides a distributed<br>
contact surface for interacting with the resilient urging assembly 300 as well as for providing a<br>
pivotal support to the pivoting motion of the drive conversion member to be explained below. It<br>
will be noted that the main body of the button interfacing cap 200 and the main housing 500 of<br>
the switch together forms a co-operative guiding means so that the push-button can slide in and<br>
out of the main housing along a predetermined direction, that is, linearly towards and away from<br>
the rocker member during mode changing operations.<br>
The resilient urging means of this embodiment comprises a resilient urging assembly 300<br>
which is disposed between the button interfacing cap 200 and the rocker member 110. The<br>
resilient urging assembly comprises first resilient means 320 and second resilient means 330.<br>
The first resilient means 320 is for providing a resilient return-urging force so that the push<br>
button or the button interfacing cap will be returned from a depressed position to the initial<br>
spring neutral or zero displacement position d0 after it has been released. This first resilient<br>
urging means also helps to mitigate the abruptness or ruggedness to be felt by a user in the<br>
course of actuating a push button rocker switch due to the actuation force characteristics of a<br>
rocker switch by introducing an incremental resistive resistive force against the motion of the<br>
push button while the push button is travelling towards but before encountering the rocker<br>
member. By gradually increasing the resistive force while the push button is moving towards<br>
the rocker member, the height of the resistive force step, that is, the abrupt step at d1, will be<br>
reduced and the user will experience a better "feel".<br>
Thus, the first resilient urging means of this resilient urging assembly 300 serves a plurality<br>
of purposes in this invention. Firstly, it provides an incremental resistive force, e.g., a variable<br>
resistive force, against the movement of the push-button which will cause change of operation<br>
modes. Specifically, this resistive force is present so that a user can feel the resistive force<br>
substantially along the entire displacement range of the push-button. Secondly, it provides a<br>
resilient spring bias for restoring the push-button to its zero displacement position when the<br>
push-button is released. Thirdly, it provides an additional incremental resistive force to narrow<br>
the step gap of the rocker actuation force to be explained below. Examples of suitable resilient<br>
urging assembly are shown in Figs. 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D. Of course, other suitable forms of<br>
resilient urging assembly can be adopted without loss of generality. Also, while an assembly is<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
described in the specification, it will be appreciated that the term is used only for convenience.<br>
Naturally, the resilient urging assembly can be formed as a single unit or as a distributed means.<br>
The second resilient urging means 330 serves to provide additional resilient resistive force<br>
against the push button when the push button is moving towards but before encountering the<br>
rocker member. This resistive force is incremental so that the step-height of the additional or<br>
differential actuation force required to over inertia of the rocker member is reduced.<br>
To benefit from the additional incremental resistive force while still maintaining a compact<br>
design, a drive conversion means comprising a drive conversion member 400 for converting a<br>
linear motion of the push button to a rotary or pivotal drive motion is disposed between the<br>
button interfacing cap 200 and the rocker member 100.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2A, an example of a resilient urging assembly 300 comprises a platform<br>
member 310 and a pair of spring members 320. The pair of spring members is disposed on the<br>
lateral sides underneath the platform member. Each of the spring members is a coil spring with<br>
the spring axis substantially parallel to the direction of the actuating force so that when the push<br>
button is depressed, the coil springs are compressed. When the push button is released, the<br>
stored energy in the spring members will provide a returning spring force to return the push<br>
button to the spring zero position, Of course, the spring members can be adapted so that they<br>
are stretched, instead of compressed, during push button actuation. Fig. 2B shows a variation<br>
of a resilient urging assembly 300A with a centrally disposed single coil spring to replace the<br>
laterally displaced spring members of Fig. 2A. The coil spring may have a rectangular cross<br>
section instead of a circular cross section as depicted. Fig. 2C shows another variation of an<br>
exemplary resilient urging assembly 300B with the spring members of Fig. 2A replaced by a pair<br>
of resilient legs which are symmetrical about the center of the metallic board and are divergent<br>
from the metallic board. Fig. 2D shows yet another exemplary resilient urging assembly<br>
comprising a platform member and a pair of resilient legs. In this design, the platform member<br>
and the pair of resilient legs are separable which facilitate possible individual tuning of the<br>
spring forces of the two parts for enhanced flexibility.<br>
To provide an additional incremental resistive force against the push button in its course to<br>
change operation modes of the rocker switch so as to narrow the aforementioned resistive force<br>
step or differential, the resilient urging assembly 300 provides an additional spring means. This<br>
additional spring means is adapted to perform the requirements of the secondary resilient<br>
counteracting means mentioned above and will be referred to as secondary spring means<br>
herein for convenience. In this example, the platform member 310 is formed from a resilient<br>
material, such as a steel plate, and is made as a thin metallic board. The secondary spring<br>
means comprises a pair of spring arms 330 which are integrally formed with the metallic board<br>
and overhanging the metallic board. As can be seen from Fig. 2A, a spring arm 330 joins the<br>
metallic board at one of its longitudinal ends and extends towards the other longitudinal end of<br>
the metallic board. The free ends of the pair of spring arms are opposite and approaching each<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
other. In other words, the pair of spring arms are substantially colllinear and parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the metallic board.<br>
The drive conversion means comprises a pendulum-like drive conversion member (or a<br>
pendulum member in short) 400 which is adapted for converting the linear motions of the push<br>
button into a rotary or pivotal motion so as to facilitate change of operation modes of the rocker<br>
switch. The pendulum-like drive conversion member 400 comprises a main body 410 which is<br>
pivotally mounted on the housing of the button interfacing cap 200. A pair of slightly chamfered<br>
shoulder portions 420 is formed at the distal end of the main body 410 which is distal from the<br>
pivotal axis. The shoulder portions 420 are chamfered so that the distal ends of the main body<br>
slant away from the centerline of the main body such that the outside edges of the main body<br>
are shorter than the middle portion of the main body 410. The shoulder portions are laterally<br>
displaced from the centerline of the main body and are always substantially symmetrically about<br>
the pivotal axis. This lateral symmetry facilitates a symmetrical operation of the rocker switches<br>
of the type as shown in Fig. 1 with two operation modes.<br>
The operation of the push button operated rocker switch of Fig. 2 will now be explained with<br>
reference to Figs. 3 to 9. As shown in Figs. 3 and 3A, the push button is initially at its zero<br>
displacement position or the spring neutral position do. When an actuation force F is applied, a<br>
reactive force F2 due to the primary spring means, that is, the spring members 320, will be<br>
encountered. In Figs. 4 and 4A, the push button has moved downwards for a predetermined<br>
distance and is at a displacement d1. At this displacement, the front edge on the right shoulder<br>
of the pendulum-like drive conversion member 400 will begin to move into contact with a<br>
corresponding protruding head of the rocker member. Also, the rear side of the right shoulder<br>
portion of the drive conversion member is also touching the underside of the spring arm 330.<br>
Due to the outwardly slanting slope of the chamfered shoulder portion, the drive conversion<br>
member will operate like a cam on the protruding head and begin to rotate anti-clockwisely<br>
about its pivotal axis when the push button is depressed further. Since the rear side of the<br>
shoulder portion of the drive conversion means is already touching the spring arm at<br>
displacement position d1, when the push button is depressed further from displacement d1 to d2,<br>
the additional rotation of the conversion drive member will tend to move the spring member<br>
away from the plane of the metallic board. As the spring member is hinged to the metallic board,<br>
the free end of the spring arm 330 will pivot about the junction between the spring arm 330 and<br>
the metallic board.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 5A, when the push button is now at the displacement position d2,<br>
the spring arm 330 has pivoted clock-wisely through an angle a about the pivotal junction. As<br>
the spring arm 330 is integrally formed with the resilient metallic board, a resilient urging force<br>
as represented by a force arrow F1 will act on the spring arm when the spring arm is at<br>
displacement position d2. At this displacement, the total resistive or counteracting force F which<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
is to be experienced by a user will be a resultant of the vertical components of the forces F1 &amp; F2.<br>
The displacement position d2 in this example is selected to be the position at which the rocker<br>
member is just about to be subject to a toggling force. The angular position a is also set to be<br>
the maximum angle through which the spring arm can pivot. This maximum angular position is<br>
set by a limiting means disposed on the main housing of the push button, for example, in the<br>
form of a ceiling which prevents further advancement of the spring member 330. In summary,<br>
the source of the actuation and resistive forces are as follows:-<br>
(a)	F, the actuation force applied by a user on the push-button,<br>
(b)	F2, the upward resistive force due to the spring member 320 of the resilient urging<br>
assembly,<br>
(c)	F1, the force acting on the spring arm when the spring arm has rotated for an angle<br>
a.<br>
In Fig. 6, the push button has been moved further downwards for an additional<br>
displacement 5 and is now at a displacement d2 + 5 , where d is of an infinitely small value. At<br>
this displacement position, the push button has been depressed with an adequate force applied<br>
to overcome the initial turning inertia of the rocker member so that the rocker member will begin<br>
to pivot about its axis. The resistive force represented by the force arrow F3, which is at an<br>
angle Y to the vertical, is the additional force acting on the rear edge of the shoulder portion of<br>
drive conversion member by the push button housing which provides the additional threshold<br>
force to overcome the inertia of the rocker member. At this displacement, the total resistive or<br>
counteracting force F which is to be experienced by a user will be a resultant of the vertical<br>
components of the forces F1, F2 &amp; F3.<br>
In Fig. 7, the push button is shown at displacement d3. At this displacement, the rocker<br>
member has reached the critical threshold displacement so that it will complete the mode<br>
changing toggling movement automatically without requiring additional external force. The push<br>
button actuation mechanism is configured so that the push-button can move further downwards<br>
from the displacement position d3 until the bottom dead end d4 An additional free displacement<br>
range (d3 to d4 in the present example) is provided, for example, to accommodate the variation<br>
in the critical threshold displacement of the rocker member or to cater for tolerance in the rocker<br>
member characteristic due to effluxion of time. At this stage, the resilient force due to the spring<br>
arm 330 will act to return the drive conversion member 400 back to its initial zero displacement<br>
position.<br>
In Fig. 8, the push button is shown at displacement d4. At this displacement, the rocker<br>
member 110 has complete operation mode change and the spring arm 330 will continue to drive<br>
the drive conversion member clock-wisely back to the initial position.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/076870									PCT/CN2006/000120<br>
In Fig. 9, the push button has been returned to the zero displacement position d0 by the<br>
spring members 330 after the push button is released. At this displacement position, the rocker<br>
member has complete operation mode change and. the spring arm 330 has returned the drive<br>
conversion member back to the initial starting position.<br>
The overall resistive force F felt by a user in the above course of operation mode change is<br>
shown in Fig. 10D. The force diagram of Fig. 10D is a resultant of 3 forces, namely, the force F2<br>
due to the spring members 320 which increases with displacement between d0 to d4 as shown<br>
in Fig. 10B, the vertical component of the counteractive force F1 acting on the spring arms 330<br>
which is incremental between d1 to d2 and which remains constant thereafter due to the limiting<br>
device and the vertical component of F3, the additional forcing acting by the rear edge of the<br>
shoulder portion of the drive conversion member on the push-button housing. It has been<br>
assumed for the sake of simplicity that the force acting on the hinge is negligible. It will be<br>
appreciated that the height of the resistive step d1 as shown in Fig. 10A has been significantly<br>
reduced.<br>
Referring to Figs. 11 to 16, there is shown a second preferred embodiment of an electrical<br>
switch of the present invention in the form of a switch-able socket outlet comprising a push-<br>
button actuated rocker switching mechanism. In the description below, because the main<br>
operating parts are generally similar, parts which are similar, identical or equivalent to that of the<br>
first preferred embodiment above will be identified with the same numeral for brevity and<br>
convenience where appropriate unless the context otherwise requires.<br>
Similar to the switch 10 of the first preferred embodiment, the electrical switch 20<br>
comprises a rocker switching mechanism 100, a push-button comprising a button interfacing<br>
cap 200, resilient urging assembly 300, drive conversion means 400 and a main housing 500.<br>
Similar to the first preferred embodiment, the resilient urging assembly comprises primary and<br>
secondary spring urging means. The primary resilient urging means provides incremental<br>
resistive force commensurate with the amount of downward movement of the push button and<br>
is exemplified by a pair of spring members 320. The second spring urging means is exemplified<br>
by a pair of overhanging spring arm members 330 with their respective fixed ends disposed<br>
near the ends of the lateral wings of the exemplary spring-like metallic board 310 with the free<br>
ends directing towards each other.<br>
The switch-able socket also comprises a movable contact member and a fixed contact<br>
member the connection of which are toggled by the rocker switching mechanism. Figs. 11-16<br>
show a sequence of operations by which the movable rocker member 110 is moved from a first<br>
switching position to a second switching position by the push button. The sequence of<br>
operations is substantially the same as that illustrated by Figs. 2-9 and is not repeated here.<br>

whether with or without modification, to other types of switches without loss of generality. Also,<br>
the reference to dimensions and displacement is only for comparison and is not meant to<br>
