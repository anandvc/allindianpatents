TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a disazo pigment composition. More specifically the present invention relates to (1) a method for manufacturing a disazo pigment that is capable of producing a printing ink with a superior transparency and flow ability; (2) a disazo pigment capable of producing a printing ink with a superior transparency and flow ability; and (3) a printing ink that exihibits a superior transparency and flow ability.<br>
This application is based on the patent application No. Hei 10-11503 3, filed in Japan, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As examples of conventional methods for improving transparency and flow ability of printing inks containing disazo pigments, Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 45-11026 discloses a method for mixing sulfonic acid compounds into disazo pigments; Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho. 55-49087 discloses a method for using a disazo pigment formed by using a mixture of non-polar coupling components and polar coupling components having carboxyl groups and/or sulfo groups as coupling components; and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-72762 and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-178169 respectively disclose a method of using a disazo pigment composition containing asymmetric disazo compounds which are formed from polar coupling components and non-polar coupling components,<br><br>
-2-<br>
respectively. Among these disclosures, it is known that a disazo pigment obtained according<br>
to the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho. 55-49087 is more effective in improving the transparency of printing inks, and that a disazo pigment composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-178169 is more effective in improving the flow ability of printing inks.<br>
In addition, as a method for improving the transparency, WO97/31067 discloses a method for coupling non-polar coupling components and tetrazo component of the benzidines. However, the extent of improvement in the transparency according to WO97/31067 is remarkably small, and Furthermore, no suggestions regarding the flow ability were mentioned.<br>
With regard to methods for manufacturing -printing inks, there exist a manufacturing method for dispersing wet pigments by means of using a kneader; and a manufacturing method for dispersing powder pigments by means of using a triple roll or beads mill. The choice of the manufacturing method is based mainly on the productivity and demands for the inks. There are several determining factors for the quality required for printing inks; among these, however, it is most important to choose a pigment that is appropriate for the intended use, as well as for the manufacturing method.<br>
In the printing industry, printing inks exhibiting a high transparency are in great demand for their role in improving the clearness of the prints. Additionally, in the printing industry, from the viewpoint of increased productivity, the printing speed is undergoing remarkable improvements. Currently, a printing, machine capable of printing at a speed of 4 meter per second enjoys widespread use as the industry .standard, however, a printing machine capable of printing 15 meter per second has been already developed. In accordance with this increasing printing speed, flow abilities greater than those obtained to date are highly desired for the printing inks.<br><br>
3 <br>
Conventionally, as a method for effectively improving the transparency, Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho: 55-49087 is known. The method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho, 55-49087 provides for the synthesis of a) a disazo pigment (represented by the following general formula A), which comprises a non-polar coupling component (represented by the following general formula 1) and a non-polar coupling component (represented by the following general formula I); and b) an asymmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula B) comprising a polar coupling component (represented by the following general formula II) and a non-polar coupling component (represented by the following general formula I); and (c) a symmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula C) comprising a polar coupling component (represented by the following general formula II) and a polar coupling component (represented by the following general formula II), in,the same reaction vessel. The asymmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula B) is known for its effects in improving the transparency and flow ability of printing inks.<br>
However, although the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho. 55-49087 produces an asymmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula B) effective in improving the transparency, it also results in the large production of a symmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula C), which deteriorates the transparency and flow ability. Therefore, this method has failed to provide the necessary transparency desired by the present printing industry.<br>
Additionally, if the speed of dissolving the nompolar coupler component (represented by the following general formula I) into an acidic solution varies from that of the polar coupler component (expresses by the following general formula II), it is impossible to adsorb the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula B, which is effective in improving the transparency and flow ability, uniformly to the disazo pigment<br><br>
4<br>
(represented by the following general formula A), or introduce the asymmetric disazo compound into the crystalline structure. As a result, it becomes impossible to provide the necessary transparency demanded by the present printing industry.<br>
In other words, when the speed of dissolving the polar coupler component (represented by the following general formula II) into an acidic solution is faster than the speed of dissolving the non-polar coupler component (represented by the following general formula I) into an acidic solution, the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula B) and the symmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula C) are preferentially produced at the initial stage of the coupling reaction, and in the middle to later stages of the coupling reaction, only the disazo pigment (represented by the following general formula A) is produced. Thus, it is impossible to provide the transparency required by the present printing industry.<br>
In contrast, when the speed of dissolving the polar coupler component (represented by the following general formula II) into an acidic solution is slower than the speed of dissolving the non-polar coupler component (represented by general formula I) into an acidic solution, only the disazo pigment (represented by the following general formula A) is produced from the initial to middle stages of the coupling reaction, with the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula B) and the symmetric disazo compound (represented by the following general formula C) beingpreferentially produced during the later stage of the coupling reaction. Thus, in a similar manner, it is impossible to provide the transparency required by the present printing industry.<br>
As a result of reasons, similar to the aforementioned, the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 55-49087 failed to provide the flow ability required by the present printing industry.<br><br>

CH3COCH2CONH - Z	... General Formula (I)<br>
[wherein, Z represents a phenyl group which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, and chlorine atom].<br>
CH3COCH2CONH - Y	... General Formula (II)<br>
[wherein, Y represents a phenyl group which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, hydroxide group, and chlorine atom, and containing 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group, sulfo group, and alkali metal salts thereof].<br><br>
[wherein, Z1 represents a phenyl group, which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from" the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, and chlorine atom].<br><br>

[wherein, Z1 represents a phenyl group, which may .contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, and chlorine atom; and Z2 represents a phenyl group which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, hydroxide group, and chlorine atom; and containing 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group, sulfo group, and alkali metal salts thereof].<br><br>
[wherein, Z2 represents a phenyl group which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, hydroxide group, and chlorine atom; and containing 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group, sulfo group, and alkali metal salts thereof).<br><br>
7 <br>
Additionally, as a conventional technology for effectively improving the flow ability, the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho. 63-178169 is known. The method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho. 63-178169 relates to a disazo pigment composition, which is formed by means of synthesizing an asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B) comprising a polar coupling component and a non-polar coupling component, and adding the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B) to a separately synthesized, disazo pigment (represented by general formula A), comprising a non-polar coupling component and a non-polar coupling component.<br>
However, due to collision of the particles resulting from the stirring during the process of synthesis, or forces imposed during the processes of filtration, drying, and grinding, particles of the disazo pigment, and the asymmetric disazo compound become aggregated, which makes it difficult to adsorb the asymmetric disazo compound to the primary particle surface of the disazo pigment, thereby resulting in a failure to provide tfre flow ability required by the present printing industry. Due to reasons similar to the aforementioned, the above- method is not able provide the transparency required by the present printing industry.<br>
Herein, although an attempt was made at increasing the blending amount of the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B), a deterioration in the tinting strength occurred, such that the above method was not able to provide a disazo pigment suitable for practical use.<br>
In addition, as a conventional technology for improving the transparency, the method disclosed in W097/3106.7-is also known. The method disclosed in W097/31067 relates to a method for manufacturing a disazo pigment, which is formed by means of coupling the tetrazo component of the benzidine in an acidic solution. This method effectively reduces the<br><br>
8 <br>
aromatic amines, which are by-products of the reaction, by means of improving the coupling reaction rate, resulting in an easier removal of unreacted coupling components. Additionally, it is disclosed that when used as a coloring agent, the resultant pigment results in an improvement in the transparency, the tinting strength, and glossiness thereof. The method<br>
disclosed in WO97/31067 shows a slight improvement in the transparency, when compared with the conventional method for manufacturing a disazo pigment, in which coupling with the tetrazo component of the benzidine is performed in an acidic solution after precipitating the non-polar coupling components.<br>
However, the mechanism for,improving the transparency in the aforementioned method lies in the removal of the unreacted, non-polar coupling components, which have a lower light transmittance and lower transparency (i.e., higher hiding power), compared to those of a disazo pigment. Thus, the extent of the improvement in the transparency is remarkably small, and the method has failed to provide the transparency required by the present printing industry.<br>
Moreover, the method disclosed in WO97/31067 makes no disclosure relating to the flow ability, nor provides any effects of improving the flow ability.<br>
Furthermore, according to the aforementioned conventional method which can produce a disazo pigment derivative (represented by general formula B) comprising an asymmetric disazo compound, and a disazo pigment (represented by general formula A) simultaneously, the maximum weight ratio of the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B) to the symmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula C) is limited to 90:10. Therefore, this method is still unsatisfactory from the standpoint of a variety of other properties.<br>

BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION <br>
The method for manufacturing a disazo pigment composition according to the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a disazo pigment composition, wherein an aqueous coupler solution containing a coupler component (I) and a coupler component (II), arid an aqueous tetrazo solution containing a tetrazo component of abenzidine, are poured into an acidic solution, to induce a coupling reaction.<br>
Herein, a coupling reaction is performed by means of pouring the coupler components into an acidic solution, such that, in the reaction system, none of the coupler components are precipitated, and the tetrazo component reacts immediately. As a. result, as described in greater detail below, at least a portion of the asymmetric disazo compound can be adsorbed uniformly to the primary particles of the aforementioned disazo pigment, or alternatively included in the crystalline structure thereof.<br>
In the present invention, conventionally known and used coupler components may be used as the coupler component (I) and/or the coupler component (II). The pouring method is not particularly limited, however, pouring is continuously performed under normal circumstance. These aspect are described in detail below.<br>
In other, words, according to the method of the present invention, a disazo pigment, which comprises a disazo pigment (represented by general formula A), comprising a non-polar coupling component and a non-polar coupling component; an asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B), comprising a polar coupling component and a non-polar coupling component; and a symmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula C) comprising two polar coupling components, is simultaneously provided, while manufacturing a disazo compound composition with a higher-than-conventional content ratio of the asymmetric disazo compound comprising a polar coupling component and a non-polar<br><br>
 15 coupling component.<br><br>
[wherein, Z1 represents a phenyl group, which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, and chlorine atom].<br><br>
[wherein, Z1 represents a phenyl group, which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, and chlorine atom; and Z2 represents a phenyl group which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected, from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, hydroxide group, and chlorine atom; and containing 1 to_4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group, sulfo group, and alkali metal salts thereof].<br><br>
16<br><br>
[wherein, Z2 represents a phenyl group which may contain 1 to 4 identical or different substituenf group(s), selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, methoxy group, hydroxide group, and chlorine atom; and contains 1 to 4 identical or different substituent group(s), selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group, sulfo group, and alkali metal salts thereof].<br>
The asymmetric disazo compound (above general formula B) is known to improve the transparency and flow ability of the printing ink.<br>
According to the present invention, by means of synthesizing, simultaneously, this asymmetric disazo compound with a disazo pigment (represented by general formula A), it is possible to uniformly adsorb the asymmetric disazo compqund, which is in a non-aggregate state, to the surface of the primary particles of the disazo, pigment, which is similarly in a non-aggregate state; or alternatively to, form a mixed,crystal comprising the disazo pigment and the asymmetric disazo compound. In this manner, it is possible to introduce a polar group onto the surface of the disazo pigment, and thus to obtain a disazo pigment composition which can provide the printing ink with a superior transparency and flow ability. The effects of the present invention are manifested synergistically in the ability to include a greater (more than the conventional) amount of the asymmetric component, (i.e., a pigment derivative component) in the total disazo pigment composition comprising the<br><br>
17 <br>
disazo pigment derivative, which corresponds to the asymmetric disazo compound, and the disazo pigment, which corresponds to the symmetric disazo compound; and the ability to produce the aforementioned disazo pigment and disazo pigment derivative almost simultaneously, when considering the change of the produced components during the reaction. In other words, even in the situation that both the disazo pigment and the disazo pigment derivative are finally produced, but either said pigment or said derivative is preferentially produced during the reaction, the resultant effects are unsatisfactory, even if the amount of disazo pigment contained is the same as that in the simultaneous synthesis situation. These effects of the invention meet the criteria of simultaneous synthesis.<br>
According to the conventional, method for manufacturing a disazo pigment composition, after the coupler component (I), or both the coupler component (I) and the coupler component (II), are dispersed in an acidic solution, an aqueous tetrazo solution containing a tetrazo component of a benzidine is added thereto.<br>
Both the coupler component (I) and the coupler component (II) are less soluble and dissolve at a slow rate in an acidic solution. On the other hand, the aqueous tetrazo solution containing a tetrazo component of a benzidine reacts extremely well in the aforementioned environment.<br>
Consequently, the rate determination of the reaction between the coupler component (I) and/or the coupler component (II), and the aqueous tetrazo solution, containing a tetrazo component of a benzidine, occurs during the course of dissolving the coupler component (I) and/or the coupler component (II), in an acidic solution.<br>
If the speed of dissolving the.coupler component (I) in an acidic solution differs from that of the coupler component (II), a smaller amount of the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B), which provides the effects of improving transparency and flow ability, and a greater amount of the symmetric disazo compound (represented by<br><br>
18 <br>
general formula C), which does not contribute towards improving transparency and flow ability, are produced. Thus, it becomes difficult to provide the superior transparency and flow ability, required by the present printing industry.<br>
When comparing the present invention and WO97/31067, the foremost point of difference in the technical structures of the two disclosures lies in that only a non-polar couplercomponenrts used in WO97/31067, while both a non-polar coupler component and polar coupler component are used in the present invention. Accordingly, the molar ratio of the total amount of the coupler components to the amount of the tetrazo component may be selected from within the range conventionally known. For example, the molar ratio of the total amount of the coupler components to the amount of the tetrazo component is in the range between 2:0.8 to 2:0.99. However, the molar supply speed can be expressed more precisely using this molar ratio.<br>
According to the present invention, the total molar supply speed of the coupler component (I) and coupler component (II) is preferably faster than the molar supply speed of the tetrazo component; in this manner, a total molar supply speed of the former equaling 2.0 to 2.5 times the molar supply speed of the tetrazo component may be selectively obtained.<br>
In oilier words, since the present invention provides a disazo pigment composition, the total number of moles of the coupler component (I) and the coupler component (II) supplied is preferably greater than the number of moles of the tetrazo component that are supplied, such that two azo bonds are formed (i.e., to form a 'disazo' compound), wherein the number of moles .of the former is 2.0 to 2.5 times greater than the number of moles of the latter. In particular, the number, of moles of the former is 2.0 to 2.5 times greater than the number of moles of the latter, optimally during,,or at the point of pouring the aqueous tetrazo solution.<br>
A preferred method for manufacturing a.disazo pigment composition according to the<br><br>
19 <br>
present invention comprises performing a coupling reaction by means of continuously pouring an aqueous coupler solution containing a non-polar coupler component (I) and a polar coupler component (II), and an aqueous tetrazo solution containing a tetrazo component of a benzidine, into an acidic solution, such that the ratio of the total molar supply speed of the coupler component (I) and the coupler component (II) to the molar supply speed of the tetrazo component ranges between 200:80 and 200:99.<br>
In other words, since an aqueous coupler solution concurrently containing a coupler component (I) and a coupler component (II) is used and supplied continuously into an acidic solution, the reaction with the aforementioned aqueous tetrazo solution containing a tetrazo component of a benzidine proceeds, during which time, the aforementioned coupler component (I) and coupler component (II) are either not precipitated, or precipitated in an extremely small amount.<br>
Accordingly, a larger amount of the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formuja B), which provides the advantageous effects of improving transparency and flow ability, is produced, while little to none of the symmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula C), which does not contribute towards improving the transparency and flow ability, is produced. Thus, it is possible to provide the necessary transparency and flow ability, required by the present printing industry.<br>
In the case of using the same coupler components and tetrazo component, according to the manufacturing method of the present invention, either only the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B) is produced, or alternatively a weight ratio of the asymmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula B) to the symmetric disazo compound (represented by general formula C) of at least 93/7 can be produced. Furthermore, it is also possible to increase the content of the asymmetric disazo compound to produce a desirable weight ratio of 95/5 or greater.<br><br>
20 <br>
Examples of the non-polar coupler component (I), employed in the present invention, include those represented by the aforementioned general formula (I), wherein two or more types of the aforementioned components can be used together, as long as they are represented by general formula (I).<br>
Concrete examples of the non-polar coupler component (I) include acetoacetanilide, acetoacet-o-toluidide, acetoacet-m-xylidide, acetoacet-o-anisidide, acetoacet-p-anisidide., acetoacet-o-chloroanilide, acetoacet-2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroanilide, and the like.<br>
Among these, acetoacetanilide, acetoacet-o-toluidide, and acetoacet-m-xylidide are preferred from the standpoint of markedly improving the transparency according to the present invention.<br>
Examples of the polar coupler component (II), employed in the present invention, include those represented by general formula (II), wherein two or more types of the components can be used together, as long as they are represented by general formula (II).<br>
