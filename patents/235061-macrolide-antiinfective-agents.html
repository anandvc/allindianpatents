				<td>MACROLIDE ANTIINFECTIVE AGENTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention is-directed to antibacterial compounds that expand the repertoire of<br>
erythromycin-like antibiotics. More particularly,the invention concerns macrolide<br>
antibiotics containing an erythronolide nucleus modified at least at the substituent<br>
at C-13.<br>
Background Art<br>
The increasing number of microbial strains that have acquired resistance to the<br>
currently available known antibiotic compounds is recognized as a dangerous threat to<br>
public health. As the use of such compounds has proliferated,so too has the need for<br>
expanding the options available to treat a wide variety of microbial-based conditions.<br>
The need for a larger choice of antimicrobial compounds extends beyond treatment of<br>
human infection and to a need to preserve food and other perishable commodities. New<br>
antibiotics can also be essential for resistant plants and animals as well as to provide<br>
resistance to materials that otherwise are subject to microbially caused corrosion.<br>
Thus,there is a clear need for an expanded armament of compounds which can<br>
provide a multifaceted defense against unwanted microbial activity.<br>
PCT Publication No. WO 98/09978 published 12 March 1998 and incorporated<br>
herein by reference discloses modified forms of erythromycin which lack a cladinose<br>
residue at the 3-position and which are derivatized in various ways in positions 9-12 of<br>
the macrolide ring. Similarly,U.S. Patent No. 5,750,510,issued 12 May 1998 and<br>
incorporated herein by reference,discloses modified erythromycin derivatives.<br>
The naturally occurring erythromycins have the structure<br><br>
wherein R' can be H or OH and R" can be H or CH3.<br>
All of the compounds disclosed in the above-referenced patent documents contain<br>
an ethyl group at position 13 of the macrolide ring. The present inventors have found that<br>
alterations in the substituent at position 13 results in a large number of compounds with<br>
excellent antibacterial activity.<br>

Modes of Carrylng Out the Invention<br>
The compounds of the invention are conveniently synthesized by combining<br>
synthetic chemical techniques with microbiological processes involving genetically<br>
engineered microorganisms. Briefly,in a preferred mode of carrylng out the invention,a<br>
microbial host,preferably a host which does not itself produce a macrolide antibiotic,is<br>
provided with a recombinant expression system for the production of modified<br>
6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB),which expression system in some instances will have<br>
been altered by a disruption in the catalytic domain of the ketosynthase moiety in the first<br>
module. For substituents in which Rd is methyl,host cells are used which do not have a<br>
disrupted domain of the ketosynthase moiety. This alteration in the 6-dEB polyketide<br>
synthase (PKS) results in the inability of this PKS to utilize its native starter unit,and<br>
thus permits inclusion of a synthetic diketide thioester for its initial condensation product<br>
in the sequence of reactions leading to modified 6-dEB without competition from the<br>
diketide that would otherwise,natively,have been produced. Thus,the recombinant host<br>
can be provided a synthetic diketide thioester for incorporation into the resulting<br>
polyketide. The incorporation of this diketide into the resulting polyketide results in a<br>
polyketide with a substituent at position 13 that may be selected as desired. Preferred<br>
methods for preparing the synthetic polyketide thioesters are set forth in PCT Publication<br>
No. WO 00/44717 which claims priority to copending Patent Application U.S. Serial No.<br>
60/117,384 filed 27 January 1999 and 09/492,733 filed on 27 January 2000,which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Recombinant forms of the 6-dEB PKS containing inactivated ketosynthase (KS)<br>
domains in the first module (KS1) and appropriate organisms modified to contain an<br>
expression system for this PKS are described in PCT Publications WO 97/02358,<br>
published 28 January 1997 and WO 99/03986,published 28 January 1999,incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The polyketide resulting from expression of the modified PKS is then isolated and<br>
purified,if desired,from the recombinantly modified organism and fed to<br>
Saccharopolyspora erythraea,which contains the functionality for postpolyketide<br>
modifications,including glycosylation. Other modifications include hydroxylation at<br>
positions 6 and 12. The resulting modified erythromycin is then isolated and chemically<br>
modified to obtain the compounds of the invention. Synthetic methods for providing<br>
these modifications are described in PCT Publication No. WO 98/09978 and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,750,510,referenced hereinabove.<br>
The general method for synthesizing intermediates to compounds of the invention<br>
is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The method for synthesizing compounds from intermediates of the invention is<br>
shown in Figure 2.<br>
The resulting antiinfective compound is active in vitro and in vivo for activity<br>
against a panel of representative microorganisms. The compounds of the invention thus<br>
exhibit a sufficient diversity in specificity to cover the spectrum of antibiotic activities<br>
desired.<br>
For use in treating infectious disease,the compounds of the invention are<br>
formulated into suitable compositions which will include typical excipients,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable counterions if the compound is a salt,further additives as<br>
desired,such as antioxidants,buffers,and the like,and adrninistered to animals or<br>
humans. The types of formulations that are appropriate for these compounds are similar<br>
to those for the macrolide antibiotics in general Formulations may be found,for<br>
example,in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Co.,latest edition.<br>
The compounds can be administered by any desired route,including injection,oral<br>
administration,transdermal administration,transmucosal administration,or any<br>
combination. The compounds of the invention can also be administered with additional<br>
active ingrethents if desired.<br>
The compounds of the invention are of formulas (l)-(3) as set forth above,as well<br>
as any stereoisomeric forms of these compounds as shown. The particular stereoisomers<br>
depicted are those resulting from the preferred method of synthesis set forth above and<br>
exemplified herein; however,by modifylng the expression system for the PKS,or by<br>
altering the chirality of the diketide,or by synthetic chemical conversion,other<br>
stereoisomers may also be prepared. Additional chiral centers may be present in the<br>
substituents,such as Ra and Rd. The stereoisomers may be administered as mixtures,or<br>
individual stereoisomers may be separated and utilized as is known in the art.<br>
The properties of the compounds of formulas (l)-{3) are defined by the<br>
substituents Ra-Rc,L,T,Y and Z. Preferred embodiments of these substituents are set<br>

fluoroethyl, chloroethyl, vinyl, 3-butenyl, or azidoethyl and more preferably propyl, <br>
fluorocthyl, chloroethyl, vinyl, 3-butenyl, or azidoethyl. PCT Publication No. WO<br>
00/44717 which claims priority to U.S. Serial No. 60/117, 384 filed 27 January 1999 and<br>
U.S. Serial No. 09/492, 733 filed 27 January 2000 both of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference describe various oligoketide thioesters, preferably diketide thioesters, that<br>
can be incorporated at the C-13 position. Such diketide thioesters as described therein are<br>
incorporated into the compounds of the invention and thus determine preferred Rd groups<br>
at the C-13 position.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, Ra is H or lower C1-C3 alkyl, and more<br>
preferably methyl. Ra is also preferably arylalkenyl or arylalkynyl such as 3-arylprop-2-<br>

When T-L-0 forms a carbamate ring, a combination of substituents on the<br>
carbamate nitrogen (R), the 6-0 position (Ra), and the 13 position (Rd) are especially<br>
preferred. In a first preferred combination, Ra is preferably arylalkyl, arylalkenyl or<br>

embodiment of compound (1) T-L-O does not form a carbamate ring.<br>
Synthesis of the Invention Compounds<br>
As described above, the antibiotic starting materials for any further chemical<br>
synthesis are prepared, preferably, by feeding a suitable diketide to a microorganism<br>
modified to contain an expression system for the 6-dEB PKS containing a KS1 knockout, <br>
or by a host cell that provides a methyl at the 13-position, followed by providing the<br>
resulting polyketide to a recombinant strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea that has<br>
been altered to eliminate production of 6-dEB. A strain can be prepared that is able to<br>
hydroxylate both the 6- and 12-positions or the 12-position only. In the latter case, -ORa<br>
is replaced by -H. The recombinant S. erythraea strain, K40-67, is obtained by<br>
transforming an S. erythraea strain that produces high levels of erythromycin A with a<br>
plasmid comprising a mutated eryAl sequence encoding an inactivated KS1 domain. By<br>
homologous recombination, the resulting transformants now are unable to produce 6-dEB<br>
as a competitor to the substrate polyketide and, instead, hydroxylate the 6-position and<br>
12-position and glycosylate the 3-position and 5-position of the modified polyketide that<br>
has been made in Streptomyces or other polyketide-producing transformant. If a<br>
macrolide having only the 12-position, and not the 6-position hydroxylated is desired<br>
(ORa is replaced by H), an S. erythraea strain is constructed by disrupting the eryF<br>
hydroxylase gene in strain K40-67. Alternatively, the eryK gene can be disabled, wherein<br>
embodiments of compounds (l)-(3) may readily be produced.<br>
Formation of the compounds of formulas (l)-(3) requires the production of the<br>
erythronolide having a hydroxyl at the 12-position. The starting material may include any<br>
of the compounds (4)-(6):<br>
The glycosylation reactions for the production of the erythromycins result in the<br>
diglycosylated forms analogous to the compounds set forth in formula (4) herein. If the<br>
compounds of formula (4) are to be prepared from the initial product, the hydroxyl group<br>
of the cladinose ring (attached to position 3) may then need to be protected for subsequent<br>
modification of the macrolide substituents.<br>
The modified erythromycins of the invention, in addition to modification at C-13, <br>
contain an -OH group at position 6 unless ORa is replaced by H as described above. To<br>
construct, ultimately, the compounds of formulas (1), (2) and (3) where position 6 is ORa, <br>
the compound of formula (1) (see Figure 1) is provided with protecting groups which<br>
form one embodiment of Rc and Rc. Such protection is effected using suitable protecting<br>
reagents such as acetic anhydride, benzoic anhydride, benzochloro formate, <br>
hexamethyldisilazane, or a trialkylsilyl chloride in an aprotic solvent. Aprotic solvents<br>
include, for example, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF) and the like.<br>
Mixtures may also be used. Protection of both sugar hydroxyls in formula (I) may be<br>
done simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
In addition to protecting the 2' and 4" hydroxyl groups of the two glycose residues,<br>
 the keto group at position 9 of the macrolide ring must also be protected. Typically, this<br>
is effected by converting the keto group to a derivatized oxime. Particularly preferred<br>
embodiments for R in the formula =NOR include unsubstituted or substituted alkyl<br>
(1-12C), substituted or unsubstituted aryl (6-10C), alkyl (1-12C), substituted or<br>
unsubstituted heteroaryl (6-IOC), alkyl (1-12C), and heteroalkyl (such as substituents of<br>
the formula CR'2OR wherein each R', in addition to being independently embothed as R<br>
as set forth above, may, together with the other, form a cycloalkyl ring (3-12C)). A<br>
preferred derivatized oxime is of the formula =NOR wherein R is isopropoxycyclohexyl.<br>
With the 9-keto group and the 2' and 4" hydroxyls protected, it is then possible to<br>
alkylate tlie 6-hydroxy group in the compound of formula (I) by reaction with an<br>
alkylating agent in the presence of base. Alkylating agents include alkyl halides and<br>
sulfonates. For example, the alkylating agents may include methyl tosylate, 2-fluoroethyl<br>
bromide, cinnamyl bromide, crotonyl bromide, allyl bromide, propargyl bromide, and the<br>
like. The alkylation is conducted in the presence of base, such as potassium hydroxide, <br>
sodium hydride, potassium isopropoxide, potassium t-butoxide, and an aprotic solvent<br>
The choice of alkylating agent will depend on the nature of the substituents Ra to<br>
be included. As set forth above, Ra can be substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-10C), <br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl (2-10C), or substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl<br>
(2-10C). Particularly preferred axe unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl, or substituted<br>
forms of these wherein the substituents include one or more halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy<br>
(1-6C), oxo, SO2R (1-6C), N3, CN, and NR2 wherein R is H, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
alkyl (including cycloalkyl) (1-12C), substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl (including<br>
cycloalkenyl) (2-12C), alkynyl (including cycloalkynyl) (2-12C), substituted or<br>
unsubstituted aryl (6-10C), including the hetero forms of the above.<br>
Especially preferred are methyl, allyl and ethyl.<br>
Once the alkylation of the 6-hydroxyl is completed, the sugar residues and the<br>
macrolide ring may be deprotected. Deprotection of the glycoside moieties is conducted<br>
as described by Green, T.W., et al., in Protective Groups in Oreanic Synthesis, infra.<br>
Similar conditions result in converting the derivatized oxime to =NOH. If formation of<br>
the underivatized oxime is not concurrent with deprotection, the conversion to the oxime<br>
is conducted separately.<br>
The oxime can then be removed and converted to a keto group by standard<br>
methods known in the art. Deoximating agents include inorganic sulfur oxide<br>
compounds such as sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium pyrosulfate, sodium thiosulfatc, and<br>
the like. In this case, protic solvents are used, such as water, methanol, ethanol, <br>
isopropanol, trimethyl silanol and mixtures of these. In general, the deoximation reaction<br>
is conducted in the presence of an organic acid.<br>
At this point in the process, or later, after the compound of formula (4) has been<br>
converted to the compounds of formulas (5) or (6) or to any of compounds (l)-(3), as<br>
further described below, the group introduced at the 6-hydroxyl can further be<br>
manipulated. Conveniently, the initial substitution may provide a 6-O-allyl, i.e., <br>
O-CH2CH=CH2, which can further be derivatized by reduction to give the 6-0 propyl<br>
compound, or be treated with osmium tetroxide to provide the 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl<br>
compound, which can further be esterified at each oxygen atom. The O-allyl derivative<br>
can also be oxidized with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in an aprotic solvent to provide<br>
the epoxy compound which can be opened with amines or N-containing heteroaryl<br>
compounds to provide compounds with N-containing side-chains, or can be oxidized<br>
under Wacker conditions to provide the substituent O-CH2-C(O)-CH3, or can be ozonized<br>
to provide the aldehyde. The aldehyde can then be converted to the oxime or reacted with<br>
a suitable amine and reduced in the presence of a borohydride reducing agent to provide<br>
an amine. The oxime can also be converted to a nitrile by reaction wim a dehydration<br>
agent in an aprotic solvent The O-allyl derivative can also be reacted with an aryl halide<br>
under Heck conditions (Pd(II) or Pd(O), phosphine and amine or inorganic base) to<br>
provide a 3-aryl prop-2-enyl derivative. This derivative can then be reduced with<br>
hydrogen and palladium on carbon to provide a 3-arylpropyl derivative. If the initial<br>
substituent Ra is a 2-propyne, similar reactions can be employed to provide alterations in<br>
the side-chain, including arylation.<br>
In order to convert the compound of formula (4) into the compound of formula<br>
(6), by first removing the cladinose moiety, the compound of formula (4) is treated with<br>
mild aqueous acid or with a deglycosylating enzyme. Suitable acids include hydrochloric, <br>
sulfuric, chloroacetic, trifluoroacetic and the like, in the presence of alcohol. Reaction<br>
times are typically 0.5-24 hours at a temperature of -10-35°C During this reaction, the 2'<br>
group of the remaining sugar is protected as set forth above and deprotected subsequent<br>
to the decladinizing reaction. The resulting hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the<br>
macrolide ring is then oxidized to the ketone using a modified Swern oxidation<br>
procedure. In this procedure, an oxidizing agent such as N-chlorosuccinimide-dimethyl<br>
sulfide or a carbodiamide-dimethylsulfoxide. is used. Typically, a compound of formula<br>
(4) is added to pre-formed N-chlorosuccvnimide and dimethyl sulfide complex in a<br>
chlorinated solvent such as methylene chloride at -10-25°C. After being stirred for 0.5-4<br>
hours, a tertiary amine such as triemylamine is added to produce the corresponding<br>
ketone and the 2' protecting group is then removed.<br>
In order to halogenate the macrolide at position 2 (converting Rb=H to halogen), <br>
the compound of formula (6), where Rb=H, is treated with a base and an electrophilic<br>
halogenating reagent such as pyridinium perbromide or N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide.<br>
Position 2 can be halogenated at any time after the 3 kcto compound is prepared and<br>
preferably after the 11, 12 ring is formed.<br>
The appropriate substituent such as vinyl, ethenyl, butenyl or azido at the C-13<br>
position can be further manipulated. For example, an amidoacetate salt of the compound<br>
of the invention can be derivatized using an arylacetyl chloride to yleld an arylamino<br>
alkyl group on the C-13 position as illustrated in Figure 10. Preferably the C13<br>
derivatives of an azido group take place before the ketolide is formed. Derivations of an<br>
alkenyl group such as ethenyl can take place either before or after the ketolide is formed<br>
and preferably after the 11, 12 ring is formed, as shown in Figures 14 and 16.<br>
in order to obtain the compounds of formula (5), the compound resulting from the<br>
deglycosylation reaction of formula (4) is treated with a dehydrating agent such as<br>
carbonyl diimidazole and base.<br>
Intermediates (7)-(9) can then be prepared from intermediates (4)-(6).<br>
It will be noted that the presence of the 12-hydroxyl group is required. The<br>
hydroxyl groups of the sugar moieties are protected as described above and the resulting<br>
protected compounds arc then reacted with sodium hexamethyldisilazide and<br>
carbonyldiimidazole which results in dehydration to obtain a ir-bond at position 10-11<br>
and derivatization of the 12-hydroxyl to provide functionality in the macrolide ring as<br>
shown in compounds (7)-(9). Figure 2 illustrates the reaction sequence from compound<br>
(4) to compound (9) in the first step.<br>
Reaction of compounds (7)-(9) with aqueous ammonia provides a compound of<br>
formulas (l)-(3) wherein L is carbonyl and T is NH as shown in Figure 2 for compounds<br>
(9) and (3) in the second step.<br>
Reaction of compounds (7)-(9) with compounds of the formulas H2NR, H2NOR, <br>
H2NNHCOR, H2NN=CHR or H2NNHR, where R is H or Ra, provides the corresponding<br>
compounds of formulas (l)-(3) wherein T is nitrogen derivatized as described with the Rf<br>
substituents including -R, -OR, -NHCOR, -N=CHR or -NHR. In Figure 2, Rf is H<br>
because ammonia is used. These are compounds of the formulas (10)-(12):<br>
where Rf represents the substituents on the nitrogen as described above. Figure 3<br>
analogously depicts the reaction of compound (7) with H2NRf to form compound (10).<br>
The preparation follows the procedure described by Baker et al. J Org Chem (1988)<br>
53:2340, which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular, treatment of compound<br>
(7) with an amino compound of the formula H2N-Rf results in formation of the cyclic<br>
carbamate in which Rf is as described above. The protected 2'-hydroxy group can be<br>
deprotected as described above.<br>
Alternate or additional procedures may be used to prepare compounds (10)-(12)<br>
where Rf is not H.<br>
For example, the compounds of formulas (10)-(12) wherein Rf is H can be reacted<br>
with an alkylating agent which is of the formula R-halogen to replace the hydrogen on the<br>
ring nitrogen with an alkyl group.<br>
Further, compounds (10)-(12) that do not contain an acyl group as a substituent on<br>
the nitrogen of T can be formed by treatment of such compounds (10)-(12) with an<br>
acylating agent selected from the group consisting of R(CO)-halogen or (RCO)2O to give<br>
compounds (7)-(9) wherein T is -N- and Rf is -NH-COR.<br>
Treatment of compounds (10)-(l 2) where Rf is -NH2 with an aldehyde R-CHO, <br>
wherein R is as defined previously gives compounds (10)-(12) wherein Rf is -N=CHR.<br>
Treatment of compounds (10)-(12), where Rf is -NH2 with an alkylating agent<br>
having the formula R-halogen, wherein R is as defined previously, gives the compounds<br>
(10K12) where Rf is R.<br>
Of course, if the substrate for the ring formation is a compound of formula (4), a<br>
compound of the formula (3) results; modifications can then be conducted to convert the<br>
compound of formula (3) to compounds of formulas (1) and (2), as described above.<br>
Under these circumstances, the keto group would be protected by a derivarized oxime.<br>
Such modifications include removal of the cladinose moiety by acid hydrolysis; oxidizing<br>
the 3-hydroxyl group; and deprotecting the protected hydroxyl and keto groups.<br>
According to the alternate procedure shown in Illustrated Scheme 4a (Figure 4a), <br>
the intermediate compound (10, which is the 9-oxime compound of erythromycin A, is<br>
subjected to acid hydrolysis with dilute mineral or organic acid as described previously to<br>
remove the cladinose moiety and give intermediate compcund (I:). The oxime compound<br>
(I2) is then converted to the protected oxime compound (I3) wherein V is =N-O- Rl where<br>
R1 is a protecting group, by reaction with the appropriately substituted oxime protecting<br>
reagent. The 3 and 2'-hydroxy groups of (I3) are then protected, preferably with a<br>
trimethylsilyl protecting group, to give compound (I4). Compound (I4) is then alkylated<br>
as described previously to give compound (I5), and compound (I5) is first deoximated as<br>
described above then the deoximated product is converted to the compound (I6) by the<br>
procedures described for preparation of compound (3) from compound (4) in Illustrated<br>
Scheme 2. Figure 4b shows compound (I6) is then deprotected and oxidized to the<br>
3-ketolide derivative, compound (10) of the invention, wherein L is CO and T is -NRf by<br>
procedures described previously. Intermediate compound I6 can also be deprotected and<br>
dehydrated to form compound (11) of the invention, also shown in Figure 4b.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the 6-position substituent can be manipulated after the<br>
compounds (l)-(3) are formed. For example, compound (10) can be prepared wherein Ra<br>
is -CH2-CH-N-ORh and Rh is H or C1-C3-alkyl, aryl substituted C1-C3-alkyl, orheteroaryl<br>
substituted C1-C3-alkyl. In this method, compound (10), wherein Ra is -CH2-CH=CH2, is<br>
treated with ozone to form compound (10) wherein Ra is -CH2-CH=O.<br>
The compound (10) wherein Ra is -CH2-CH=O is further treated with a<br>
hydroxylamine compound having the formula NH2-O- Rh, wherein Rh is as previously<br>
defined; and optionally deprotecting, and isolating the desired compound. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the process immediately above, Rr is H.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention is a process for preparing a compound<br>
(10) wherein Ra is -CH2-CH2-NH-Rj where Ri, with the atom to which it is attached, form<br>
a 3-10 membered substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl ring.<br>
The method comprises reductively animating compound (10) wherein Ra is<br>
-CH2-CH=O with an amine compound having the formula -NH2-Ri, wherein Ri is as<br>
previously defined; and optionally deprotecting, and isolating the desired compound.<br><br>
Compounds of the formulas (l)-(3) where L is carbonyl and T is -O- or wherein L<br>
is methylene and T is -O- , are prepared from compounds (4)-(6) using the procedure<br>
described by Baker et al, J Org Chem (1988) 53:2340 which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The 2' or 2', 4"-protected compounds of formulas (4)-(6) are first converted to<br>
the cyclic carbonates by reaction with carbonyldiimidazole and sodium<br>
hexamethyldisilazide.<br>
Compounds (13)-(15) represent compounds (l)-(3) where L is methylene and T is<br>
-O- :<br><br>
Illustrative Scheme 5 in Figure 5 illustrates the conversion of the compound<br>
having formula (6) to the compound having the formula (1). Figures 11 and 13 illustrate<br>
the conversion of erythromycins to ketolides.<br>
In order to prepare compounds of formulas (4)-(6) or (l)-(3) wherein one of Z and<br>
Y is H and the other OH or protected OH or is an amino derivative as described above, <br>
either the carbonyl or oxime or derivatized oxime is reduced using a suitable reducing<br>
agent. Substituted amines are obtained by alkylation.<br>
Novel methods of synthesis of the compounds of the invention are also provided.<br>

Compound numbers and designations are found in the Illustrative Schemes and in<br>
the prior disclosure.<br>
In these examples, in the first general step of the method, a 6-deoxyerythronolide<br>
B (6-dEB) derivative compound is prepared by fermentation of a recombinant<br>
Streptomyces host cell.<br>
The fermentation to produce 15-methyl-6-deoxyerythronolide B and 14, 15-<br>
dehydro-6-deoxyerythronolide B requires a synthetic diketide intermediate to be fed to<br>
the fermenting cells. The preparation of these synthetic diketides is described in Example<br>
1. These synthetic diketides are substrates for a 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS)<br>
that is unable to act on its natural substrate (propionyl CoA) due to a mutation in the<br>
ketosynthase domain of module 1 of DEBS. This recombinant DEBS is provided by<br>
plasmid pJRJ2 in Streptomyces coelicolor CH999. S. coelicolor CH999 is described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5, 672, 491, incorporated herein by reference. A derivative of<br>
S. coelicolor CH999, S. coelicolor K39-02, that has been genetically modified to include<br>
a ptpA gene, is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/181, 833, incorporated<br>
herein by reference can also be employed for this purpose.<br>
Plasmid pJPJ2 encodes the eryAI, eryAII, and eryAIII genes; the eryAI gene<br>
contained in the plasmid contains the KS1 null mutation. The KS1 null mutation<br>
prevents formation of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B produced by the wild-type gene unless<br>
oogenous substrate is provided. Plasmid pJRJ2 and a process for using the plasmid to prepare nove113-<br>
substituted erythromycins are described in PCT publication Nos. 99/03986 and 97/02358 and-<br>
in US. patent application Serial Nos. 08/675, 817, filed 5 July 1996; 08/896, 323, filed 17 July<br>
1997; and 09/311, 756, filed 14 May 1999, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The exogenous substrates provided can be prepared by the methods and include the<br>
compounds described in PCT patent application No. PCT/US00/02397 and U.S. patent<br>
application Serial No. 09/492, 733, both filed 27 Jan. 2000, by inventors G. Ashley et at., and<br>
both of which claim priority to U.S. patent application Serial No. 60/117, 384, filed 27 Jan.<br>
1999, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. PKS genes other than the ery genes<br>
can also be employed; suitable genes include the KSl null mutation containing oleandolide<br>
and megalomicin PKS genes described in U.S. patent application Serial Nos. 60/158, 305, <br>
filed 8 Oct 1999 and 09/428, 517, filed 28 Oct 1999, and PCT application No; US99/24478, <br>
filed 22 Oct 1999, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The fermentation of Streptomyces coelicoIor CH999/pSRJ2 and S, coelicolor<br>
CH999/pCK7 is described in Example 2. The isolation of the 6-deoxyerythronolide products<br>
resulting from this fermentation can be achieved by separation.<br>
The isolated productsare then added to the fermentatiorrbrothof Saccharopolyspora<br>
erythraea strains to make other useful intermediate compounds of the invention. The<br>
S. erythraea strains catalyze the biosynthesis and attachment of sugar residues to the 3 and 5<br>
positions of the 6-dEB derivative compounds. These strains also comprise a functional eryK<br>
gene product and so hydroxylate the 6-dEB derivative compounds at the 12 position. The<br>
strains differ in regard to whether a functional eryF gene product is produced. If so, then the<br>
compounds produced are hydroxylated at the 6 position as well. If not, then a 6-<br>
deoxyerythromycin A derivative is produced. These S. erythraea fermentations are described-<br>
in Example 3, together with the isolation of the erythromycin A derivative compounds from<br>
the fermentation broth.<br>
The isolated products are then used as intermediates in the chemical synthesis of<br>
other intermediate compounds of the invention. For erythromycin A derivative<br>
intermediates that comprise a 6-hydroxyl, Examples 4-6 describe the process for<br>
alkylating the compounds to make the 6-O-alkyl intermediates of the invention. The<br>
schematic for these reactions is shown in Figure 7.<br>
 Example 1<br>

The processes used to prepare the N-acetylcysteaminethioesters (NAcS) used to<br>
feed the recombinant Streptomyces host cells to make the 15-methyl and 14, 15-dehydro-<br>
6-deoxyerythronolide B intermediate compounds are described in this Example. The<br>
synthesis protocols described below are also described in PCT Publication No. WO<br>
00/44717 which claims priority to U.S. Pro-visional Patent Application Serial No.<br>

three-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a 500 mL addition funnel and a stir bar<br>
was charged with 20 g of (4S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone, capped with septa and flushed<br>
with nitrogen. Anhydrous THF (300 mL) was added by cannula and the resulting<br>
solution was cooled with a -78°C bath of dry ice/isopropanol. The addition funnel was<br>
charged with 78 mL of n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane) by cannula, which was added in<br>
a slow stream to the reaction. Distilled propionyl chloride (bp 77-79°C), 8.0 mL, was<br>
added rapidly via syringe. The reaction was allowed to stir for 30 min. in the dry<br>
ice/isopropanol bath.<br>
The reaction was removed from the cold bath, allowed to warm to &gt;0°C, and<br>
quenched with 50 mL of saturated aqueous NH4CI. The mixture was concentrated to a<br>
slurry on a rotary evaporator. The slurry was extracted three times with 250 mL portions<br>
of ethyl ether. The organic extracts were combined and washed with 50 mL each of<br>
saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine, dried with MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to<br>
give a yellow oil. The material crystallized upon sitting. The crystals were triturated<br>

A dry, 2 L three-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a 500 mL addition funnel, a<br>
low-temperature thermometer, and a stir bar was charged with 19.84 g of N-propionyl-<br>
oxazolidinone, capped with septa and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous dichloromethane<br>
(100 mL) was added by cannula, and the resulting solution was cooled to -65°C in a bath<br>
of dry ice/isopropanol. The addition funnel was charged by cannula with 100 mL of<br>
dibutylboron triflate (1.0 M in dichloromethane), which was added in a slow stream to the<br>
reaction. Triethylarmine (15.6 mL) was added dropwise by syringe, keeping the reaction<br>
temperature below -10°C. The reaction was then transferred to an ice bath and allowed to<br>
stir at 0°C for 30 min. After that period, the reaction was placed back into the dry<br>
ice/isopropanol bath and allowed to cool to -65°C. Butyraldehyde (8.6 mL) was added<br>
rapidly by syringe, and the reaction was allowed to stir for 30 min.<br>
The reaction was transferred to an ice bath and the addition funnel was charged<br>
with 100 mL of a 1 M aqueous phosphate solution, pH 7.0 (the phosphate solution is<br>
comprised of equal molar amounts of mono- and dibasic potassium phosphate). The<br>
phosphate solution was added as quickly as possible while keeping the reaction<br>
temperature below 10CC. The addition funnel was then charged with 300 mL methanol<br>
which was added as quickly as possible while keeping the reaction temperature below<br>
10°C. Finally, the addition funnel was charged with 300 rnL of 2:1 methanol:30%<br>
hydrogen peroxide. This was added dropwise to ensure that the temperature was kept<br>
below 10°C. The reaction was stirred for one hr. after completion of addition. The<br>
solvent was then removed on a rotary evaporator until a slurry remained. The slurry was<br>
extracted 4 times with 500 mL portions of ethyl ether. The combined organic extracts<br>
were washed with 250 mL each of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and brine. The<br>
extract was then dried with MgSO4, filtered, and. concentrated to give a slightly yellow<br>
oil. The material was then chromatographed on SiO2 using 2:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate<br>
(product Rf = 0.4) resulting in 22.0 g (85% yleld) of title compound as a colorless oil.<br>

E. (2S, 3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoate N-acetylcysteamine thioester: N-<br>
acetylcysteamine was distilled at 130°C/7 mm Hg to give a colorless liquid at room<br>
temperature. A dry, 1 L three-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a 500 mL<br>
addition funnel and a stir bar was capped with septa and flushed with nitrogen. The flask<br>
was then charged with 10.7 mL of N-acetylcysteamine by syringe and with 400 mL of<br>
anhydrous THf by cannula. The mixture was cooled with a MeOH/ice bath.<br>
Butyllithium (64 mL of 1.6 M in hexanes) was added dropwise by syringe, resulting in<br>
formation of a white precipitate. After stirring for 30 min., trimethylaluminum (51 mL of<br>
2.0 M in hexanes) was added dropwise by syringe. The reaction became clear after<br>
addition of trimethylaluminum and was allowed to stir an additional 30 min. During this<br>
period, 20.5 g (0.068 mol) of (4S)-N-[(2S, 3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxylhexanoyl]-4-benzyl-2-<br>
oxazolidinone was put under a blanket of nitrogen and dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous<br>
THF; this solution was then transferred in a slow stream by cannula into the reaction.<br>
The resulting reaction mixture turned a yellow-green color and was allowed to stir for 1<br>
hr. The reaction was finished when the starting material could no longer be seen by thin-<br>
layer chromatographic analysis (ca. 1 hr.)-<br>
The reaction was treated with enough saturated oxalic acid to give a neutral<br>
reaction with pH paper (approximately 90 niL). The solvents were then removed on a<br>
rotary evaporator to give a white slurry. The slurry was extracted six times with 250 mL<br>
portions of ethyl ether. The organic extracts were combined and washed with brine, dried<br>
with MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give a slightly yellow oil. The thioester<br>
product was purified by flash chromatography on SiO2 using 1:1 hexanes:EtOAc until the<br>
elulion of 4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone. At that point, the solvent system was switched to<br>
100% EtOAc to give pure fractions of diketide thioester. The product fractions were<br>
combined and concentrated to give 14.9 g (89% yleld) of title compound. This<br>
compound is referred to as the propyl diketide thioester in Example 2.<br>

oxazolidinone: A dry, 2 L three-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a 500 mL<br>
addition funnel, a low-temperature thermometer, and a stir bar was charged with 20.0 g of<br>
propionyl oxazolidinone A, capped with septa and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous<br>
dichloromethane (100 ml) was added and the resulting solution was cooled to -15°C in a<br>
bath of methanol/ice. Dibutylboron trifiate (100 mL of 1.0 M in dichloromethane) was<br>
added in a slow stream via the addition funnel at such a rate as to keep the reaction<br>
temperature below 3°C. Diisopropylethylamine (17.9 mL) was added dropwise by<br>
syringe, again keeping the internal temperature below 3°C. The reaction was then cooled<br>
to -65°C using a dry ice/isopropanol bath. Acrolein was added over 5 min. by syringe.<br>
The reaction was allowed to stir for 30 min. after completion of addition.<br>
The reaction was then transferred to an ice bath and the addition funnel was<br>
charged with 120 mL (0.1 mol) of a 1 M aqueous phosphate solution, pH 7.0 (the<br>
phosphate solution is comprised of equal molar amounts of mono- and dibasic<br>
phosphate). The phosphate solution was added as quickly as possible while keeping the<br>
reaction temperature below 10°C. The addition funnel was then charged with 400 mL of<br>
methanol that were added as quickly as possible while keeping the reaction temperature<br>
below 10°C. Finally, the addition funnel was charged with 400 mL of 2:1 methanol:30%<br>
hydrogen peroxide by initial dropwise addition to keep the temperature below 10°C. The<br>
reaction was stirred for one hour. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator, <br>
leaving a slurry. The slurry was extracted 4 times with 500 mL portions of ethyl ether.<br>
The organic extracts were combined and washed with 250 mL each of saturated sodium<br>
bicarbonate and brine, then dried with MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give a slightly<br>

G. (2S.3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate N-acetylcysteamine thioester:<br>
N-acetylcysteamine was distilled at 130°C/7 mm Hg to give a colorless liquid at room<br>
temperature. A dry, 1 L three-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a 500 mL<br>
addition funnel and a stir bar was capped with septa and flushed with nitrogen. The flask<br>
was then charged with 7.5 mL of N-acetylcysteamine by syringe and with 500 mL of<br>
anhydrous THF by cannula. The reaction was then cooled with a MeOH/ice bath.<br>
Butyllithium (44 mL of 1.6 M in hexane) was added dropwise by syringe. A white<br>
precipitate formed as the n-BuLi was added. After stirring for 30 min., 35.5 mL (0.071<br>
mol) of trimethylaluminum (2.0 M in hexane) were added drop-wise by syringe. The<br>
reaction became clear after addition of trimethylalurninum and was allowed to stir an<br>
additional 30 min. (4S)-N-[(2S, 3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-pentenoyl]-4-benzyl-2-<br>
oxazolidinone from Preparation F (13.6 g) was put under a blanket of nitrogen, dissolved<br>
in 50 mL of anhydrous THF, and this solution was then transferred in a slow stream by<br>
cannula into the reaction. The resulting reaction mixture turned a yellow-green color and<br>
was allowed to stir for 1 hr. The reaction was judged to be finished when starting<br>
material could no longer be seen by thin-layer chromatography (ca. 30 min.).<br>
Enough saturated oxalic acid was added to give a neutral reaction with pH paper<br>
(approximately 60 mL). The solvents' were then removed by rotary evaporator to give a<br>
white slurry. The slurry was extracted six times with 250 mL portions of ethyl ether. The<br>
organic extracts were combined, washed with brine, dried with MgSO4, filtered, and<br>
concentrated to give a slightly yellow oil. The thioester was then purified by flash<br>
chromatography on SiO2. The column was run with 1:1 hexanes: ethyl acetate until the<br>
elution of oxazolidinone. At that point, the eluent was switched to 100% ethyl acetate to<br>
give pure fractions of product. The fractions were combined and concentrated to give 7.7<br>
g (71% yleld) of title compound product. This product is referred to as the vinyl diketide<br>

Example 2<br>
Preparation of Erythronolide<br>
A. 15-methyl-6-deoxyerythronolide B (Compound P, Rd=propyl):<br>
Streptomyces coelicolor CH999/pJPJ2 is described in PCT Publication No. WO<br>
97/02358 which claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 08/896, 323, filed<br>
17 July 1997, and 08/675, 817, filed 5 July 1996, each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Plasmid pJRJ2 encodes a mutated form of DEBS in which the ketosynthase<br>
domain of module 1 (KS1) has been inactivated via mutagenesis (KS1°). S. coelicolor<br>
strains comprising this plasmid that are fed (2S, 3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoate-N-<br>
acetylcystermina (Preparation E, propyl diketide) of Example 1 produce 15-methyl-6-<br>
deoxyerythronolide B.<br>
A 1 mL vial of the CH999/pJRJ2 working cell bank is thawed and the contents of<br>
the vial are added to 50 mL of Inoculum Medium 1 in a 250 mL baffled flask. The flask<br>
is placed in an incubator/shaker maintained at 30±1°C and 175±25 RPM for 48±10 hours.<br>
The 50 mL culture is then added to a 2.8 L baffled flask containing 500 mL of Inoculum<br>
Medium 1. This flask is incubated in an incubator/shaker at 30±1°C and 175±25 RPM<br>
for 48±10 hours. The 500 mL culture is divided equally among ten 2.8 L baffled flasks<br>
each containing 500 mL of Inoculum Medium 1. All flasks are then incubated as<br>
described previously.<br>
A 150 L fermenter is prepared by sterilizing 100 L of Production Medium 1 at<br>
121°C for 45 minutes. After incubation, al110 flasks are combined in a 5 L sterile<br>
inoculation bottle and aseptically added to a 150 L fermenter. The fermenter is controlled<br>
at 30°C, pH 6.5 by addition of 2.5 N H2SO4 and 2.5 NNaOH, dissolved oxygen = 80%<br>
air saturation by agitation rate (500-700 RPM), air flow rate (10-50 LPM), and/or back<br>
pressure control (0.1-0.4 bar). Foam is controlled by the intermittent addition of a 50%<br>
solution of Antifoam B.<br>
At 24±5 hours (2S, 3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine (propyl<br>
diketide, Preparation E in Example 1) is added to a final concentration of 1 g/L. Propyl<br>
diketide is prepared by solubilizing in dimethyl sulfoxide at a ratio of 1:4 (diketide to<br>
DMSO) and then filter sterilized (0.2 µm, nylon filter). Production of 15-methyl-6-<br>
deoxyerythonolide B (15-methyl-6dEB) ceases on day 7 and the fermenter is harvested.<br>
The fermentation broth is centrifuged at 20, 500 g in an Alpha Laval™ AS-26 centrifuge.<br>
The product is predominantly in the centrate; the centrifuged cell mass is discarded.<br>
This process has also been completed in a 1000 L fermenter (700 L working<br>
volume). The inoculum process is identical to the above process except that the 150 L<br>
fermenter is charged with Inoculum Medium 1 and the 1000 L fermenter is charged with<br>
Production Medium 1. The fermenter is controlled at 30°C, pH 6.5 by addition of 2.5-5 N<br>
H2SO4 and 2.5-5 N NaOH, dissolved oxygen =70% air saturation by agitation rate (140-<br>
205 RPM), air flow rate (100-200 LPM), and/or back pressure control (0.2-0.5 bar).<br>
Foam is controlled by the addition of a 50% solution of Antifoam B as needed. At 24±5<br>
hours racemic 2-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoyl-N-propionylcysteamine (300 grams) is added<br>
to the 1000 L fermenter. The fermenter is harvested at 4.6 days by centrifugation as<br>
described above.<br>
Media used in this process include the following:<br>
Sterilized by autoclaving for 60 minutes at 121 °C.<br>
Post-sterile additions:<br>
1) 1 mL/L of 50 mg/ml Thiostrepton in 100% DMS O, sterile filtered.<br>
2) 1 mL/1100% Antifoam B silicon emulsion (J.T. Baker), autoclaved.<br>
3) 40 mL of 500 g/L glucose, sterile filtered.<br>
Sterilized in fermenter for 45 minutes at 121°C.<br>
Post-sterile additions for Production Medium 1 :<br>
1) 1 mL/L of 50 mg/ml Thiostrepton in 100% DMSO, sterile filtered.<br>
2) 1 mL/L of 100% Antifoam B (J.T. Baker), autoclaved.<br>
After centrifugation, the centrate is filtered. The filtrate (approximately 700 L)<br>
are passed through an Amicon™ Moduline column (20 x 350 cm) containing 20 L of<br>
HP20 resin (Mitsubishi). The flow rate during loading is 4 L/minute with a pressure drop<br>
below 8 psi (55, 152 Pa). After loading the resin is washed with 20 L of water and then 40<br>
L of 30% methanol. 15-methyl-6dEB is eluted using 100% methanol. Four 12 L fractions<br>
were collected with fractions 2, 3 and 4 containing all of the detectable 15-methyl-6dEB.<br>
The l5-methyl-6dEB product pool is diluted with 36.7 L of water giving 75 L of a clear<br>
solution. This solution is loaded directly onto a 5 L Amicon™ Vantage Column<br>
containing HP20SS resin (Mitsubishi). Column loading is carried out at 1 IVminute. The<br>
column is eluted with 20 L of 65% methanol, 20 L of 70% methanol, 20 L of 80%<br>
methanol, and finally 20 L of 100% methanol. A total of 16 x 5 L fractions were<br>
collected. The 80% fractions along with the last 70% fraction were combined (25 L) and<br>
evaporated to dryness. The resulting residue is dissolved in 1 L of 100% methanol, <br>
filtered, evaporated, and dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C. This process resulted in 33 g of<br>
a solid product containing 93% 15-methyl-6dEB.<br>
B. 14.15-dehydro-6-deoxyerythronoride B (Compound P, Rd=vinyl):<br>
S, coelicolor strains comprising this plasmid that are fed (2S, 3R)-2-methyl-3-<br>
hydroxy-4-pentenoate NAc Cysteamine thioester (Preparation G) of Example 1 produce<br>
14, l5-dehydro-6-deoxyerythronolide B when prepared in accordance with the process<br>
described in Preparation A above to produce 15-methyl-6-deoxyerythronolide B.<br>
C. 14-nor-6-deoxyerythronolide B (Compound P, Rd=methyl): Similarly, 14-<br>
nor-6-deoxyerythronolide B is produced using S. coelicolor CH999/pCK7 host, when<br>
prepared in accordance with the process described in Example 2A<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Erythromycins<br>
The 6-dEB derivative compounds produced in Example 2, Preparations A-C are<br>
converted to erythromycin derivatives using a recombinant strain of Saccharopolyspora<br>
erythraea. For production of erythromycins having both the 6- and 12-hydroxyl groups, <br>
the S. erythraea strain used was K40-67 or K39-14V. This strain was created by<br>
transforming an S. erythraea strain capable of producing high levels of erythromycin A<br>
with a pWHM3-derived plasmid comprising a mutated eryAl sequence encoding an<br>
inactivated KS1 domain. By homologous recombination, the resulting transformants<br>
were rendered incapable of producing 6-deoxyerythronolide B. Thus the dEB analog fed<br>
is not subject to competition for hydroxylation at the 6-posirion. For production of<br>
erythromycin derivatives having only the 12-hydroxyl group, the S. erythraea strain used<br>
was K39-07. This strain was constructed from strain K40-67 by disruption of the eryF<br>
hydroxylase gene; this destroys ability to hydroxylate the analog at the 6-position. Both<br>
strains were fermented under substantially similar conditions, as described below.<br>
15-methyl-erythromycin A: 15-methyl-erythromycin A is produced according to<br>
the following protocol: A 1 mL vial of the K39-14V working cell bank is thawed and the<br>
contents of the vial are added to 50 mL of Inoculum Medium 2 in a 250 mL baffled flask.<br>
The flask is placed in an incubator/shaker maintained at 34±1°C and 175+25 RPM for<br>
4S±10 hours. The 50 mL culture is then added to a 2.8 L baffled flask containing 500 mL<br>
of Inoculum Medium 2. The flask is incubated in an incubator/shaker at 34±1°C and<br>
175±25 RPM for 48±10 hours. The 500 mL culture is divided equally among ten 2.8 L<br>
baffled flasks each containing 500 mL of Inoculum Medium 2. All flasks are then<br>
incubated as described previously.<br>
A 150 L fermenter is prepared by sterilizing 100 L of Production Medium 2 at<br>
121°C for 45 minutes. After incubation, al110 flasks are combined in a 5 L sterile<br>
inoculation bottle and aseptically added to a 150 L fermenter. The fermenter is controlled<br>
at 34°C, pH 7.0 by addition of 2.5 N H2SO4 and 2.5 N NaOH, dissolved oxygen 2 80%<br>
air saturation by agitation rate (500-700 RPM), air flow rate (15-50 LPM), and/or back<br>
pressure control (0.1-0.4 bar). Foam is controlled by the addition of a 50% solution of<br>
Antifoam B.<br>
At 24±5 hours a 58-60 mL/hour 15% dextrin (w/v) feed is initiated. The dextrin<br>
solution is continuously mixed during the feed period. At 24±5 hours 25 grams of 15-<br>
methyl-6dEB (Preparation A in Example 2) are added to the fennenter. The 15-methyl-<br>
6dEB is prepared by solubilizing 25 grams of 15-methyl-6dEB in 400-600 mL of 100%<br>
ethanol and filtering (0.2 µm, nylon filter). Conversion of 15-methyl-6dEB to 15-methyl-<br>
erythromycin A ceases after 60±10 hours and the fermenter is harvested. The<br>
fermentation broth is centrifuged at 20, 500 g in an Alpha Laval™ AS-26 centrifuge. The<br>
product is predominantly in the centrate; the centrifuged cell mass is discarded.<br>
Media used in this process include the following:<br>
Inoculum Medium 2<br>
Sterilized by autoclaving for 60 minutes at 121°C.<br>
Post-sterile addition:<br>
1 mL/1100% Antifoam B (J.T. Baker), autoclaved.<br>
Production Medium 2<br>
Sterilized in fermenter for 45 minutes at 121 °C.<br>
Centrifuged fermentation broth (127 L) containing 34 g of the target molecule is<br>
passed through 18.3 L of HP20 sorbent packed into an Amicon™ P350 Moduline 2<br>
chromatography column. At 4 L/min loading, backpressure is found to be less than 5 psi<br>
(34, 470 Pa). Following loading, the resin is washed with 20 L deionized water and then<br>
40 L of 30% methanol. 15-Methyl-Erythromycin A is eluted using 54 L of 100%<br>
methanol. The product pool is evaporated using a Buchi™ rotary evaporator (R-152). The<br>
solids were dissolved in a minimal amount of 100% methanol, filtered and the filtrate<br>
evaporated to dryness. This resulted in 123 g of material containing 30% 15-Methyl-<br>
Erythromycin A by weight. 80 grams of the 30% material is extracted twice with 1 L of<br>
40°C acetone. The acetone extract is filtered, and the filtrate is dried on the inside surface<br>
of a 20 L rotary evaporation flask. The solids were extracted with 9:1 hexane to acetone<br>
three times at 40°C. The organic extracts were pooled and evaporated to dryness giving<br>
32 g of solids enriched (68%) in 15-Methyl-Erythromycin A. The product pool from the<br>
acetone/hexane extraction is dissolved in 1 L of methanol to which an equal amount of<br>
water is added. The methanol solution is loaded onto a HP20SS chromatography column<br>
(Kontes) previously washed and equilibrated with 50% methanol. Column dimensions<br>
were 4.8 x 115 cm. Column loading with respect to 15-Methyl-Erythromycin A is 11 g/L.<br>
The column is washed with 50% (0.8 L) and 60% (8 L) methanol in water. Elution of the<br>
target molecule is carried out using 70% (8L), 80% (16 L) and 85% (8 L) methanol in<br>
water. 1 L fractions were collected. Fractions 11-29 were combined, evaporated and dried<br>
in a vacuum oven giving 23 g of product with 93% purity.<br>
This material served as starting material for the chemical derivatization<br>
procedures described in the following examples. The following compounds are also<br>
produced by this methodology: (i) 14-norerythromycin A (Rd=Me); (ii) 14, 15-dehydro-<br>
erythromycin A (Rd=allyl); (iii) 14-nor-6-deoxy-erythrcmycin A; (iv) 14, 15-dehydro-6-<br>
deoxy-erythromycin A; and (v) 15-methyl-6-deoxy-erythromycin A. When used to make<br>
3-descladinose-3-oxo-derivatives, the erythromycin A derivatives were not separated<br>
from the erythromycin C derivatives; instead, mixtures of the erythromycin A and<br>
erythromycin C compounds were used as starting materials for chemical derivatization.<br>
These products were extracted and purified as follows:<br>
In general, fermentation broths are brought to pH 8.0 by addition of NaOH and<br>
ethanol is added (0.1 L/L broth). The broth is clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto<br>
an XAD-16 resin (Rohm and Haas) column (1 kg XAD/1 g erythromycin analogs) at a<br>
flow rate of 2-4 mL/cm2-min. The loaded resin is washed with 2 column volumes of 20%<br>
(v/v) ethanol in water and the erythromycin analogs are eluted from the resin with acetone<br>
and collected in 1/2 column volume fractions. The fractions containing erythromycin<br>
analogs are identified by thin-layer chromatography (ethyl acetate:hexanes 1:1) and<br>
HPLC/MS.<br>
The acetone fractions containing erythromycin analogs are pooled and the<br>
volatiles are removed under reduced pressure. The resulting aqueous mixture is extracted<br>
with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract is washed with saturated NaHCO3 and brine<br>
solutions, dried over sodium or magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to dryness<br>
under reduced pressure. Crude material is dissolved in dichloromethane and loaded onto<br>
a pad of silica gel and washed with dichloromethane:methanol (96:4 v/v) until the eluent<br>
is no longer yellow. The desired material is with<br>
dichloromethane: methanol:triethylamine (94:4:2 v/v) and collected in fractions.<br>
Fractions containing erythromycin are identified by thin-layer chromatography, collected<br>
and concentrated under reduced pressure. This material is recrystallized from<br>
dichloromethane/hexanes.<br>
This general procedure is illustrated as follows:<br>
(i) 14-norerythromycins: 1 liter of ethanol was added to each of 10 liters of<br>
fermentation broth. The broth was centrifuged and the supernatant was passed through<br><br>
0.6 Uters of XAD (column-dimensions 17 cm x 6.5) cm at a flow rate of 100 mL/min.<br>
After loading, the column was washed with 1.5 liters of 20% (v/v) ethanol in water. The<br>
desired material was then eluted with acetone. The fractions containing this material were<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure until the volatiles were removed and the aqueous<br>
remainder was extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were washed with<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, brine, dried with magnesium sulfate and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude extract.<br>
Crude material (0.6 g) was dissolved, in dichloromethane and gravity filtered<br>
through a 3 cm pad of silica gel in a 6 cm diameter fritted funnel. The material was<br>
eluted with 400 mL of dichloromethane followed by 400 mL<br>
dichloromethane:methanol:triethylamine (90:10:2 v/v) and collected in 40 mL fractions.<br>
Fractions containing erythromycin were identified by thin-layer chromatography<br>
(ether:methanol:NH4OH 90:8:2 v/v, Rf- 0.35 and dichloromethane:methanol 95:5 v/v, <br>
Rf - 0) and concentrated under reduced pressure. This material was recrystallized from<br>
dichloromethane/hexanes.<br>
(ii) 15-methyl-erythromycin A: 8 liters of ethanol was added to approximately<br>
80 liters of fermentation broth. The broth was centrifuged and the supernatant was passed<br>
through 2.5 liters of XAD at a flow rate of 230 mL/min. After loading the column was<br>
washed with 1 liter of water and 5 liters of 20% (v/v) ethanol in water. The desired<br>
material was then eluted with acetone. The fractions containing this material were<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure until the volatiles were removed and the aqueous<br>
remainder was extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were washed with<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, brine, dried with magnesium sulfate and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude extract<br>
Crude material (8.3 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane and gravity filtered<br>
through a 3 cm pad of silica gel in a 9 cm diameter fritted funnel. The material was<br>
eluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane followed by 600 mL of dichloromethane:<br>
methanol (96:4 v/v) followed by 900 mL dichloromethane:methanol:triethylamine<br>
(89:9:2 v/v) and collected in 40 mL fractions. Fractions containing erythromycin were<br>
identified by thin-layer chromatography (ether.methanol:NH4OH 90:8:2 v/v, Rf ~ 0.4 and<br>
dichloromethane:methanol 95:5, Rr~ 0.05) and concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
This material was re-subjected to the above procedure before it was suitable for<br>
recrystallization.<br>
(iii) 14-nor-6-deoxy-erythromycins: 1 liter of ethanol was added to each of<br>
two 10 liter fermentations. The broths were centrifuged and the supematants were<br>
combined for a total of approximately 22 liters. The combined broths were then passed<br>
through 1 liter of XAD (column dimensions 23.5 cm x 6.5 cm (i.d.) at a flow rate of 170<br>
mL/min. After loading the column was washed with 2 liters of 20% (v/v) ethanol in<br>
water. The desired material was then elutcd with acetone. The fractions containing this<br>
material were concentrated under reduced pressure until the volatiles were removed and<br>
the aqueous remainder was extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were<br>
washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, brine, dried with magnesium sulfate<br>
and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude extract.<br>
(iv) 15-methyl-6-deoxy-erythromycins: 1 liter of ethanol was added to each of<br>
3 fermentors containing 10 liters of broth. The broths were centifuged and the<br>
supernatant was passed over 1.25 liters of XAD (column dimensions 40 cm x 6.5 cm) at a<br>
flow rate of 130 mL/min. The column was then washed with 3 liters of 20% (v/v) ethanol<br>
in water. The desired material was then eluted with acetone. The fractions containing this<br>
material were concentrated under reduced pressure until the volatiles were removed and<br>
the aqueous remainder was extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were<br>
washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, brine, dried with magnesium sulfate<br>
and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude extract<br>
Crude material (2.8 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane and gravity filtered<br>
