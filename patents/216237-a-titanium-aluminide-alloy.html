Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodimente<br>
The invention provides two-phase TiAl alloys with thenno-physical and mechanical properties useful for various applications such as resistance heater elements. The alloys exhibit useful mechanical properties and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures up to 1000°C and above. The TiAl alloys have extremely low material density (about 4.0 g/cm?), a desirable combination of tensile ductihty and strength at room and elevated temperatures, high electrical resistance, and/or can be fabricated into sheet material with thickness 
 <br>
Compared to TiAl alloys congaing 1 to 4 at% Cr, V, and/or Mn for improving tensile ductility at ambient temperatures, according to the present invention, tensile ductility of dual-phase TiAl alloys with lamellar structures can be mainly controlled by colony size, rather than such alloying elements. The invention thus provides high strength TiAl alloys which can be free of Cr, V, Mn amid/or Ni,<br>
Table 1 lists nominal compositions of alloys investigated wherein the base alloy contains 46.5 at% Al, balance Ti. Small amounts of alloying additions were added for investigating effects on mechanical and metallurgical properties of the two-phase TiAl alloys. Nb in amoimts up to 4% was examined for possible effects on oxidation resistance, W in amoimts of up to 1.0% was examined for effects on micro structural stability and creep resistance, and Mo in amounts of up to 0.5% was examined for effects on hot fabrication. Boron in amounts up to 0.18% was added for refinement of lamellar structures m the dual-phase TiAl alloys.<br>
Eight alloys identified as FMTA-1 to 9, having the compositions listed in Table 1, were prepared by arc melting and drop casting into a 1" diameter x 5" long copper mold, using commercially-pure metals. All the alloys were successfully cast without casting defects. Seven alloy ingots (PMTA -1 to 4 and 6 to 9) were then canned in Mo cans and hot extruded at 1335 to 1400 °C with an extrusion ratio of 5:1 to 6:1. The extrusion conditions are listed in Table 2. The cooling rate after extrusion was contoured by air cooling and quenching the extruded rods in water for a short time. The alloy rods extruded at 1365 to 1400""C showed an irregular shape whereas PMTA-8 hot-extruded at 1335°C exhibited much smoother surfaces without surface irregularities. However, no cracks were observed in any of the hot-extruded alloy rods.<br>
The microstrucmres of the alloys were examined in the as-cast and heat treated conditions (listed in Table 2) by optical metallographic and electron super probe analyses. In the as-cast condition, all the alloys showed lamellar<br><br>
structure with some degree of segregation and coring. Figures 1 and 2 show the optical micrographs, with a magnification of 200X and 500X, respectively, for hot extruded alloys PMTA-1 to 4 stress-relieved for 2 hours at lOO0°C. AH the alloys showed fiilly lamellar structures, with a small amount of equiaxed gram structures at colony boundaries. Some fine particles were observed at colony boundaries, which are identified as borides by electron microprobe analyses. Also, there is no apparent difference in micro structural features among these four PMTA alloys.<br>
Electron microprobe analyses reveal that tungsten is not uniformly distributed even in the hot extruded alloys. As shown in Figure 3, the ghost-pattern bands in a darker contrast are found to be depleted with about 0.33 at% W. Figure 4 is a back-scattered unpaged of PMTA-2, show the formation of second-phase particles (borides) in a bright contrast at colony boundaries. The composition of the borides was determined and listed in Table 3 together with that of the lamellar matrix. The second-phase particles are essentially (Ti,W,Nb) borides, which are decorated and pinned lamellar colony boundaries.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show the optical microstructures of hot extruded PMTA-3 and 2 annealed for 1 day and 3 days at lOO0°C, respectively. Grain-boundary equiaxed structures are clearly observed in these long-tenn annealed specimens, and the amount increases with the airmailing time at 1000°C. A significant amount of equiaxed grain structures exists in the specimen annealed for 3 days at 1000""C.<br>
For comparison purposes, a 9-mil thick TiAl sheet (Ti-45Al-5Cr, at%) was evaluated. Figure 7 shows the optical, microstructures of the TiAlCr sheet in both as-received and annealed (3 days at 1000°C) conditions. In contrast to the dual-phase lamellar structure of the alloys according to the invention, the TiAlCr sheet has a duplex structure, and its grain strummer shows no significant coarsening at lOOO°c.<br><br>
Tensile sheet specimens with a thickness of 9-20 mils and a gage length of 0.5 in were sectioned from the hot extruded alloys rods after annealing for 2 hours at lOOO"C, using a EDM machine. Some of the specimens were re-annealed up to 3 days at lOOO"C prior to tensile testing. Tensile tests were performed on an Instron testing machine at a strain rate of 0.1 inch/second at room temperature. Table 4 summarizes the tensile test results.<br>
All the alloys stress-relieved for 2 hours at lOOO"C exhibited 1 % or more tensile elongation at room temperature in air. The tensile elongation was not affected when the specimen thickness varied from 9 to 20 mils. As indicated in Table 4, among the 4 alloys, alloy PMTA-4 appears to have the best tensile ductile. It should be noted inapt a tensile elongation of 1.6% obtained from a 20-mil thick sheet specimen is equivalent to 4% elongation obtained from rod specimens with a gage diameter of 0.12 in. The tensile elongation appears to increase somewhat with annealing time at 1000°C, and the maximum ductility is obtained in the specimen annealed for 1 day at lOOO ° C.<br>
All the alloys are exceptionally strong, within a yield strength of more than 100 ksi (700 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength more than 115 ksi (800 MPa) at room temperature. The high strength is due to the refmed fully lamellar structures produced in these TiAJ alloys. In comparison, the TiAlCr sheet material has a yield strength of only 61 ksi (420 MPa) at room temperature. Thus, the PMTA alloys are stronger that the TiAlCr sheet by as much as 67 %. The PMTA alloys including 0.5% Mo exhibited significantly increased strengths, but slightly lower tensile elongation at room temperature.<br>
Figures 8a-b and 9a-b show the optical micrographs of PMTA-6 and 7 hot extruded at 1380°C and 1365°C, respectively. Both alloys showed lamellar grain strummers with little intercool structures. Large colony grains (see Figure 10) were observed in both alloys hot extruded at 1380°C and 1365°C, which probably resulted from abnormal grain growth in the alloys containing low levels of boron<br><br>
after hot extrusion. There is no significant difference in microstrucmral features in these two PMTA alloys.<br>
Figures lla-d show the effect of heat treatment on microstnzctures of PMTA-8 hot extruded at 1335°C. The alloy extruded at 1335°C showed much finer colony size and much more intercolony structures, as compared with those hot extruded at 1380°"C and 1365°C. Heat treatment for 2 h at 1000°C did not produce any significant change in the as-extruded structure (Figure 11a). However, heat treatment for 30 mins at 1340°C resulted in a substantially larger colony stringier (Figure lib). Lowering the heat-treatment temperature from 1340°C to 1320-1315""C (a difference by lO-TS"Q produced a sharp decrease in colony size, as indicated by Figures lie and lid. The annealing at 1320-1315°C also appears to produce more intercolony structures in PMTA-8. The abnormal gram growth is almost completely eliminated by hot extrusion at 1335°C.<br>
Tensile sheet specimens of PMTA-6 to 8 with a thickness varying from 8 to 22 mils and with a gage length of 0.5 inch were sectioned from the hot extruded alloy rods after giving a final heat treatment of 2 h at 1000""C or 20 min at 1320-1315""C, using an EDM machine. Tensile tests were performed on an Instron testing machine at a strain rate of 0.1 in/s at temperatures up to 800°C in air. All tensile results are listed in Tables 5 to 8. The alloys PMTA-4 -6 and -7 heat treated for 2 h at 1000"C showed excellent strengths at all temperatures, independent of hot extrusion temperature. The hot extrusion at 140O-1365""C gives low tensile ductility’s (
 <br>
Tables 7 and 8 also show the tensile properties of PMTA- 6 and 7 heat treated for 20 min. at 1320°""C and ISIS"C, respectively. As compared with the results obtained from heat treatment at 1000""C, the heat treatment at 1320-1315°C resulted in higher tensile elongation, but lower strength at the test temperatures. Among all the alloys and heat treatments, PMTA-8 hot extruded at 1335°C and annealed for 20 min at 1315°C exhibited the best tensile ductility at room and elevated temperatures. This alloy showed a tensile ductility of 3.3% and 11.7% at room temperature and 800""C, respectively. PMTA-8 heat treated at 1315°C appears to be substantially stronger than known TiAl alloys.<br>
In an attempt to demonstrate the bend ductility of TiAl sheet material, several pieces of 11 to 20 mil PMTA-7 and PMTA-8 alloy sheets, produced by hot extrusion and heat treated at 1320""C, were bent at room temperature. Each alloy piece did not fracture after a bend of 42°. These results clearly indicate that PMTA alloys with a controlled microstructure is bendable at room temperature.<br>
The oxidation behavior of PMTA-2, -5 and-7 was studied by exposing sheet samples (9-20 rails thick) at SOO"C in air. The samples were periodically removed from furnaces for weight measurement and surface examination. The samples showed a very low weight gain without any indication of spalling. It appears that the alloying additions of W and Nb affect the oxidation rate of the alloys at 800 °C, and W is more effective in improving the oxidation resistance of TiAl alloys. Among the alloys, PMTA-7 exhibits the lowest weight gain and the best oxidation resistance at 800°C. Oxidation of PMTA-7 indicated that oxide scales are fuly adherent with no indication of micro cracking and spallmg. This observation clearly suggests that the oxide scales formed at 800 °C are well adherent to the base material and are very protective.<br>
Figure 12 is a graph of resistivity in microhms versus temperature for samples 1 and 2 which were cut from an ingot having a nominal composition of PMTA-4, i.e. 30.8 wt% Al, 7.1 wt% Nb, 2.4 wt% W, and 0.045 wt% B.; Figure<br><br>

In summary, the hot PMTA alloys extruded at 1365 to UOO"C exhibited mainly lamellar structures with little metrology structures while PMTA-8 extruded at 1335 "C showed much finer colony structures and more intercolony structures. The heat treatment of PMTA-8 at 1315-1320""C for 20 min.. resulted in fine lamellar structures. The alloys may clued (Ti,W,Nb) borides formed at colony boundaries. Moreover, tungsten in the hot-extruded alloys is not uniformly distributed, suggesting the possibility of high electrical resistance of TiAl alloys containing W additions. The inclusion of 0.5 at. % Mo significantly increases the yield and ultimate tensile strengths of the TiAl alloys, but lowers the tensile elongation to a certain extent at room temperature. Among the four hot extruded alloys PMTA 1-4, PMTA-4 with the alloy composition Ti-46.5 Al-3 Nb-0.5 W-0.2 B (at%) has the best combination of tensile ductility and strength at room temperature. In comparison with the TiAlCr sheet material (Ti-45 AI-5Cr), PMTA-4 is stronger than the TiAlCr sheet by 67%. In addition, the TiAlCr sheet showed no bend ductility at room temperamre while PMTA-4 has an elongation of 1.4%. The tensile elongation of TiAl alloys is independent of sheet thickness in the range of 9 to 20 mils. The alloys PMTA 4, 6 and 7 heat treated at lOO0°C for 2h showed excellent strength at all temperatures up to 800°C, independent of hot extrusion temperature. Hot extrusion temperatures of 1400-1365°C, however, provides lower tensile ductility’s (
 <br>
extrusion temperature is 1335°C. PMTA-8 (Ti-46.5 AI-3 Nb-lW-0.5B) hot extruded at 1335°C and annealed at 1315°C for 20 min. exhibited the best tensile ductility at room and elevated temperatures (3.3% at room temperature and 11,7% at 800°C).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The foregoing titanium aluminide can be manufactured into various shapes or products such as electrical resistance heating elements. However, the compositions disclosed herein can be used for other purposes such as in thermal spray applications where the compositions could be used as coatings having oxidation and corrosion resistance. Also, the compositions could be used as oxidation and corrosion resistant electrodes, furnace components, chemical reactors, sulfidization resistant materials, corrosion resistant materials for use in the chemical industry, pipe for conveying coal slurry or coal tar, substrate materials for catalytic converters, exhaust walls and turbocharger rotors for automotive and diesel engines, porous filters, etc.<br>
With respect to resistance heating elements, the geometry of the heating element blades can be varied to optimize heater resistance according to the<br><br>
formula: R = p (LAV x T) wherein R = resistance of the heater, p = resistivity of the heater material, L = length of heater, W = width of heater and T = thickness of heater. The resistivity of the heater material can be varied by changes in composition such as adjusting the aluminum content of the heater material, processing or by incorporation of alloying additions. For instance, the resistivity be significantly increased by cooperating particles of alumina in the heater material. The heater material can optionally include ceramic particles to enhance creep resistance and/or thermal conductivity. For instance, the heater material can include particles or fibers of electrically conductive material such as nitrides of transition metals (Zr, Ti, Hf), carbides of transition metals, borides of transition metals and MoSi2 for purposes of providing good high temperature creep resistance up to 1200°C and also excellent oxidation resistance. The heater material may also incorporate particles of electrically insulating material such as Al2o3,Y2O3,Si3N4,ZrO2 for purposes of making the heater material creep resistant at high temperature and also improvmg thermal conductivity and/or reducing the thermal coefficient of expansion of the beater material. The electrically insulating/conductive particles/fibers can be added to a powder mixture of Fe, Al, Ti or iron aluminide or such particles/fibers can be formed by reaction synthesis of elemental powders which react exothermically during manufacture of the heater element.<br>
