FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a control device for overhead traveling cleaner in a textile mill and a method of controlling the overhead traveling cleaner to save energy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In textile mills, systems, which are not involved in direct yarn manufacturing process, are referred to as non -productive systems or ancillaries and its power consumption accounts for about 10% to 30% of the overall machines. These ancillary systems are provided with high-powered drives designed to produce optimum output. Since the ancillary system does not have a role in process output, it is necessaiy to utilize the energy efficiently that is spent for ancillaries without affecting the performance, quality and environment in the textile mills.<br>
Textile plant is one among the high-energy intensive quality seeking manufacturing plants. Quality of the outgoing yam or fabric will be affected if the waste or fluff generated out of fibre processing is not effectively managed. It is imperative for any textile mill to have control over waste removal for better quality. Fluff removal and machine cleaning can be accomplished with the support of Overhead Traveling Cleaner which is an ancillary drive associated with spinning and weaving sections of textile industry.<br>
In conventional textile mills, one overhead traveling cleaner (OHTC) has been serving for 5 to 8 ring spinning frames having 432/440/480/504-spindles. Generally OHTC has two drives, namely traveling motor drive and fan motor drive. OHTC runs along overhead rails with proper power connections and safety arrangements. The traveling motor in the OHTC of very small power does this operation. OHTC runs in<br><br>
linear motion along the machine and at the end of each machine it travels in curved path to proceed to next machine. The fan motor drive in the OHTC aids in blowing and sucking air through two different tubes hanging at both sides of the OHTC machines. Fluff and waste removed from the machine, yarn and environment are collected with the help of blowing and sucking action of OHTC through nozzles. This will be carried out continuously during the traveling of OHTC along the machine. At the end of first and last machines , a waste collection box is provided to collect the accumulated fluff and waste stored temporarily at OHTC. This is done by opening the OHTC box with a help of a lever provided at waste collection box at both end of the first and last machine to drop out the fluff and waste into the collection box. After dropping out the waste at machine end, the OHTC reverses its direction and proceeds towards next cycle of operation.<br>
OHTC consumes power continuously during the cycle of operation from the first machine to last machine. Traveling motor associated with OHTC for traction purpose is of a small fractional hp capacity. Fluff and waste will be collected from machine, yarn and environment (Floor) through sucking nozzles and stored in a miniature waste collection box at OHTC with the aid of the blower fan motor drive. In the existing system, suction is continuously created whether it is required or not and this results in energy inefficient system. In order to convert this existing uncontrolled model into an energy efficient and effective system, there is a need for a control mechanism in the textile mills.<br>
The present invention aims at providing an energy saving method of operating Overhead traveling cleaner. The term "Energy saving method" denotes that development of alternative ways to conserve energy from the existing energy consumption level without affecting the existing performance in respect to process, quality and environment. This includes several methods such as varying the rotating speed, reducing the capacity, starting and stopping of the fan motor of OHTC blower as and when required automatically etc. Out of the three methods, the variable speed method will bring in adverse effect on suction quality leading to soaking. The implementation of reducing the<br><br>
capacity of fan blower motor will also lead to creation of insufficient suction and ends up with poor evacuation of waste. Excluding the variable speed and reducing capacity, the major influencing alternative in the energy saving method is the controlling the fan motor of the OHTC blower to start and stop as and when required automatically. The starting and stopping method of the blower as and when required will be the most useful feature in order to save energy without affecting the existing performance of the OHTC in textile mills.<br>
The main feature of the control system invented for Over Head Traveling Cleaner has PLC based electronic controls with position sensors fitted in a compact control box and acts as a master control. The master control unit receives necessary pulses from the sensors at first and last machine end points from sensing points and guides OHTC blower fan to act accordingly as per the predetermined period. The change in the operating cycle can be achieved at each end of one complete movement of OHTC between the set of machines using proper placement of sensors. As the placement of sensor is directly influencing the operational cycle of the blower, the energy saving is achieved. With the help of this invention, it is possible to conserve energy in OHTC.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an energy efficient control device for the Overhead Traveling Cleaning Systems and to provide an energy saving method by reducing the running hours of the blower fan motor drive without affecting its performance thereby reducing the energy consumption. A further object of the present invention is to retrofit the developed control system along with the existing Overhead Travelling Cleaning Systems.<br>
OHTC in textile a machine runs without a break in a cycle of operation from first machine to last machine and it runs both in linear and curved path. The fluff and waste will be collected by the OHTC from machine, yarn and environment (Floor). The major quantity of fluff is generated only in the processing zone of the machines and not in the curved path. But the fan of the OHTC, which is working continuously on the curvi-linear<br><br>
path, continues to consume the same energy irrespective of the amount of waste it collects from the floor. The operation of the fan motor in curved path has no useful effect with cleaning of fluff and therefore suspending the operation of fan motor in the curved path saves energy. Therefore, the operation of the suction fan of the OHTC is stopped, allowing only the traveling motor to function during the movement over each curved path to save power.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an energy saving control system provided with position sensors and Programmable logic controllers (PLC) to achieve reduction in energy consumption on OHTC(s) in a textile- spinning mill. The control system is capable of automatically switching off the fan motor drive of the blower at the curved path at the ends of the ring frames through which OHTC travels. The existing operating cycle of the Overhead Travelling Cleaning System is altered for the optimum operation by incorporating the energy efficient control system of the present invention. The concept of such control on the system facilitates considerable saving in energy consumption which was otherwise being consumed continuously without achieving any output.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a control system for textile mills, comprising an overhead travelling cleaner with a traveling motor for moving the cleaner along the textile machines and a blower fan motor connected to a nozzle for blowing and sucking waste or fluff from the machines; said overhead travelling cleaner is provided with at least one sensor for sensing pulses from position sensors located at predetermined points on said machine and a microprocessor for actuating and de-actuating the blower fan motor based on the input received from the sensors.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a method of controlling a Overhead Traveling Cleaner in textile mill, comprising the step of operating a control device having a sensor to sense the pulse from sensing point placed at predetermined points in the ring frame of the textile machine and a micro processor control to blower fan motor of the overhead traveling cleaner such that the blower motor is switched off at the curved paths of the ring frames and switched on at the linear area of the textile machine for predetermined period thereby reducing energy consumption.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawing, in which<br>
Fig.l shows a control system for textile mills provided with overhead traveling cleaner according to the present invention.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
The control system of the present invention facilitates to control the operation of the Overhead Travelling Cleaner (1) with a traveling motor (3) and a blower fan motor (4). The OHTC (1) is also provided with a sensor (2) and a microprocessor (5). The position sensors are located at different points in the machine.<br>
The control system essentially consists of position sensors placed at predetermined locations in the system. Steel mounting flats provided with slots are used in sliding the sensors for changing the position during the course of fixation. The sensing points (6,6') are provided on the mounted brackets at each end of first and last machine end points. The sensing points (6,6') may be designed after the waste-dropping boxes are placed at the end of first and last machine. The OHTC is provided with electronic components such as Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), a DC power supply, auto/manual switch, indicating devices ON/OFF and motor reversal switch, motor contactors and soft starter etc,. The control system combined together supports the primary function of waste<br><br>
removal without compromising on quality aspects in addition to saving energy. The blower driver triggers on the blower fan motor when the OHTC runs along the machine and triggers off when it crosses the curved portion between the machines for the predetermined period programmed in the Microprocessor when OHTC starts its operation from the sensing points(6,6'). The system engages the blower fan motor whenever it is required and make idle during the rest of the time in order to save energy.<br>
This control device comprised of the sensor and microprocessor is attachable to any OHTC provided for any number of machines in textile mills. The conventional system has no control over the operation of blower fan motor, which results in its non¬stop running except for few minutes at the curved path between machines during fluff and waste removal. With the use of energy efficient control system, the existing system can be modified to suit the mills requirement.<br>
The following are the advantages of the control device according to the present invention, which reduces the running time of Blower fan motor drive of the overhead travelling cleaner.<br>
a.	The system can be incorporated in any overhead traveling cleaner (OHTC) for any<br>
number of machines.<br>
b.	High-grade sensor ensures error free operation.<br>
c. Reduced in-rush current, d. Ensures uniform performance in terms of waste collection.<br>
e.	Reduction in operating hours when compared to the existing state of art.<br>
f.	Reduction in energy consumption when compared to previous systems.<br>
g.	It can be easily retrofitted in the existing system<br><br><br>
