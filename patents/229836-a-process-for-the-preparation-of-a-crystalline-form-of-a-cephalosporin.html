Experimental part:<br>
Crystallization from acid-saturated organic solvents:<br>
The sodium salt of cephalosporin of formula III was prepared according to the methods described in EP 1087980 and HP 0849269.<br><br><br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of 0-30°C, preferred 5-25**C, most preferred 15-25°C.<br>
The crystalline material obtained contained at least 50% of crystalline material.<br>
Crystallization experiments in an acid (preferred HBr or HCl; more preferred HCl), dissolved in organic solvents as defined above (most preferred methanol), led, according to DSC, elemental microanalytics. X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, to a crystalline cephalosporin of formula II.<br>
The following examples and Fig. 1 are provided to aid the understanding of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows Powder X-ray Diffraction Pattern of crystalline form of cephalosporin of formula II (CUKQ radiation)<br>

The following table shows a series of crystallization experiments in suspension.<br>
The crystallization experiments were carried out in that cephalosporin of formula III is suspended in water and an acid (in gaseous form or in aqueous solution; preferred HBr or HCl; more preferred HCl). The resulting suspension is stirred up to 24 hours (preferably 3-20 hours, most preferred 4 - 7 hours), filtered, washed with an organic solvent (preferably acetone) and dried in an air flow for a few minutes.<br><br><br><br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of O-SCC, preferred 5-25°C, most preferred 15-25°C.<br>
Crystallization experiments in water and an acid (preferred HBr or HCl; more preferred HCl) led, according to DSC elemental microanalytics and X-ray powder diffraction, to a crystalline cephalosporin of formula II.<br>
Methods of characterizing the cephalosporin material:<br>
Dynamic vapor sorption:<br>
In general, the DVS measurement indicates the investigated crystalline sample exists as a trihydrate form.<br>
Elemental microanalytics<br>
Elemental microanalytics to demonstrate the existence (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(5-Amino-<br>
[l,2,4]thiadiazol-3-yl)-2-hydroxyimino-acetylamino]-3-[(E)-(R)-r-(5-methyl-2-	oxo-[l,3]dioxol-4-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-2-oxo-[l,3']bipyrrolidinyl-3-ylidenemethyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-l-aza-bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid Hydrochloride Trihydrate<br><br><br>
Methods of proving/characterizing the presence of crystalline parts in the prepared cephalosporin material:<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC):<br>
DSC measurements were used to identify amorphous parts in samples of the HCl-salt.<br>
DSC investigation and X-ray powder diffraction of selected samples<br>
Selected samples have been investigated by DSC with respect to amorphous parts being present. In principle, two different kind of samples were found: on the one hand samples showing decomposition between about lOO^C and 140*C, on the other hand a set of samples is characterized by an endothermic peak at about 149'C and simultaneous decomposition.<br>
Samples with an endothermic heat flow and presumably very small amorphous parts according to DSC were further investigated by X-ray powder diffraction. In general, these samples showed similar diffraction patterns but differed in the grade of crystallinity.<br><br><br><br><br>
Storage for 24 hours revealed a very good stability of the crystalline compound II in the whole temperature range of investigation. The amorphous compound I decomposed significantly at temperatures above 5°C.<br>
During 28 days a slight decomposition of crystalline compound II was observed at 25°C. In comparison, the content of compound I in the amorphous compound I decreased at 5°C and even stronger at 25*'C.<br>
After 3 months, the amorphous compound I showed a slight decomposition even at S^C. The content of amorphous compound I strongly decreased at 25°C. In contrast, the crystalline compound II showed no decomposition at 5°C as compared to -20°C, at 25'C a slight decomposition was observed.<br>
The products in accordance with the invention can be used as medicaments, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral (oral) administration. The products in accordance with the invention can be administered, for example, perorally, such as in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, such as in the form of suppositories.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds can be prepared using conventional procedures familiar to those skilled in the art, such as by combining the ingredients into a dosage form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, the usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br><br>
It is contemplated that the compounds are ultimately embodied into compositions of suitable oral or parenteral dosage forms. The compositions of this invention can contain, as optional ingredients, any of the various adjuvants which are used ordinarily in the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Thus, for example, in formulating the present compositions into the desired oral dosage forms, one may use, as optional ingredients, fillers, such as coprecipitated aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate, mannitol or lactose; disintegrating agents, such as maize starch; and lubricating agents, such as talc, calcium stearate, and the like. It should be fully understood, however, that the optional ingredients herein named are given by way of example only and that the invention is not restricted to the use hereof. Other such adjuvants, which are well known in the art, can be employed in carrying out this invention.<br>
Suitable as such carrier materials are not only inorganic, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules there can be used, for example, lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active substance; no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the preparation of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar and glucose. Suitable carrier materials for suppositiories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols.<br>
As pharmaceutical adjuvants there are contemplated the usual preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, biiffers, coating agents and antioxidants.<br>
The products in accordance with the invention can be used as medicaments, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for parenteral administration, and for this purpose are preferably made into preparations as lyophilisates or dry powders for dilution with customary agents, such as water or isotonic common salt or carbohydrate (e.g. glucose) solution.<br>
Depending on the nature of the pharmacologically active compound the pharmaceutical preparations can contain the compound  for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in mammals, human and non-human, a daily dosage of about 10 mg to about 4000 mg, especially about 50 mg to about 3000 mg, is usual, with those of ordinary skill in the art appreciating that the dosage will depend also upon the age, conditions of the mammals, and the kind of diseases being prevented or treated. The daily dosage can be administered in a single dose or can be divided over several doses. An<br><br><br><br>
