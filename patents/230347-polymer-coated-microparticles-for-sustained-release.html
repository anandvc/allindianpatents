				<td>POLYMER COATED MICROPARTICLES FOR SUSTAINED RELEASE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to sustained release microparticles for<br>
parenteral administration of therapeutic agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many drugs, proteins and peptides for use in medical therapy are susceptible<br>
to degradation at the site of administration. In addition, many of these therapeutic<br>
agents have very short in vivo half-lives. Consequently, multiple injections or<br>
multiple oral doses are required to achieve desirable therapy. It is desirable to<br>
increase the therapeutic efficacy of these therapeutic agents containing active<br>
ingredients by using parenterally administrable sustained release formulations with<br>
controlled release of the therapeutic agents.<br>
A formulation intended for parenteral use has to meet a number of<br>
requirements in order to be approved by the regulatory authorities for use in humans.<br>
It has to be biocompatible and biodegradable and all substances used and their<br>
degradation products should be non-toxic. In addition, particulate therapeutic agents<br>
intended for injection have to be small enough to pass through the injection needle,<br>
which preferably means that they should be smaller than 200 microns. The agent<br>
should not be degraded to any large extent in the formulation during production or<br>
storage thereof or after administration and should be released in a biologically active<br>
form with reproducible kinetics.<br>
Various dosage forms have been proposed for'therapeutic agents that require<br>
parenteral administration. For example, an agent may be microencapsulation by a<br>
phase separation process using a coacervation agent such as mineral oil, vegetable<br>
oils or the like, resulting in the formation of a microparticle containing the agent.<br><br>
Another microencapsulation method entails formation of a three-phase<br>
emulsion containing a therapeutic agent, a polymer, and water. A drying step yields<br>
microparticles of the agent microencapsulated in the polymer.<br>
Also reported is the formation of microparticles by spray drying, rotary disc,<br>
or fluidized bed techniques combining biodegradable polymers and therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
As mentioned above, there is a need to control the release of the<br>
microencapsulated therapeutic agent from a parenterally administrate sustained<br>
release formulation of microparticles in an accurate way. Often, the initial release<br>
rate of agent is large. This is known as the initial burst of the agent from the<br>
microparticle. In many of the controlled release systems based on biodegradable<br>
polymers, the release rate and initial burst of the therapeutic agent is largely<br>
dependent on the amount of agent incorporated into the microparticle. This is due to<br>
the formation of channels in the microparticles at higher agent loadings.<br>
A well-known way of controlling the release of therapeutic agent from solid<br>
core is to apply a synthetic, biodegradable polymer coating that produces a rate<br>
controlling film on the surface of the core particles. The release rate and initial burst<br>
of the therapeutic agent is controlled by factors including the thickness of the<br>
coating, the diffusivity of agent through the synthetic polymer comprising the<br>
coating, and the rate of biodegradation of the polymer.<br>
Often, the method of applying the coating requires use of solvents to dissolve<br>
the coating polymer prior to the coating process. This is done in cases where the<br>
melting temperature of the polymer is high enough to cause changes in the<br>
performance of the agent.<br>
Synthetic polymers may include aliphatic polyesters, polyanhydrides and<br>
poly(orthoester)s. Synthetic absorbable polymers typically degrade by a hydrolytic<br>
mechanism. Such synthetic absorbable polymers include homopolymers, such as<br>
poly(glycolide), poly(lactide), poly(e-caprolactone), poly(trimethylene carbonate)<br>
and poly(p-dioxanone), and copolymers, such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(e-<br><br>
caprolactone-co-glycolide), and poly(glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate). The<br>
polymers may be statistically random copolymers, segmented copolymers, block<br>
copolymers or graft copolymers.<br>
Alkyd-type polyesters prepared by the polycondensation of a polyol,<br>
polyacid and fatty acid are used in the coating industry in a variety of products,<br>
including chemical resins, enamels, varnishes and paints. These polyesters also are<br>
used in the food industry to make texturized oils and emulsions for use as fat<br>
substitutes.<br>
There is a great need for polymers for use as coatings in parenteral<br>
therapeutic agent delivery, where the polymers have both low melting temperatures<br>
and low viscosities upon melting, thus permitting for solvent-free processing<br>
techniques in preparation of parenteral therapeutic agent delivery compositions, can<br>
crystallize rapidly, and biodegrade within 6 months.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to sustained release microparticles for<br>
parenteral administration of therapeutic agents, especially drugs. More specifically<br>
it relates to microparticles having a core of a biodegradable polymer containing a<br>
therapeutic agent, and a coating, wherein the coating comprises a synthetic,<br>
bioabsorbable, biocompatible polymeric wax comprising the reaction product of a<br>
polybasic acid or derivative thereof, a fatty acid and a polyol, the polymeric wax<br>
having a melting point less than about 70°C, as determined by differential scanning<br>
calorimetry.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a microparticle formulation comprising<br>
microparticles of a biodegradable polymer which contain a therapeutic agent and are<br>
coated with a film of a biodegradable polymer to provide accurate control of the<br>
release rate of the agent from microparticles.<br>
A schematic drawing of the construct of coated microparticles of this<br>
invention are shown on Figure 1. The figure shows microparticle 10 which has core<br>
12 and coating layer 14. Core 12 has therapeutic agent 18 and pharmaceutical carrier<br>
16. The diameter of microparticle 10 is less than about 200 microns, small enough to<br>
pass through the injection needle. In Figure 1, therapeutic agent 18 is shown as<br>
spherical particles suspended in pharmaceutical carrier 16. One skilled in the art<br>
could envision therapeutic agent 18 as being non-spherical in shape. Also,<br>
therapeutic agent 18 may be soluble in pharmaceutical carrier 16, and core 12 would<br>
appear homogeneous in Figure 1.<br>
Synthetic polymers may be used as pharmaceutical carrier 16 in core 12 of<br>
microparticles 10. These polymers may include aliphatic polyesters, polyanhydrides<br>
and poly(orthoester)s. Synthetic absorbable polymers typically degrade by a<br>
hydrolytic mechanism. Such synthetic absorbable polymers include homopolymers,<br>
such as poly(glycolide), poly(lactide), poly(e-caprolactone), poly(trimethylene<br>
carbonate) and poly(p-dioxanone), and copolymers, such as poly(lactide-co-<br>
glycolide), poly(e-caprolactone-co-glycolide), and poly(glycolide-co-trimethylene<br>
carbonate). The polymers may be statistically random copolymers, segmented<br>
copolymers, block copolymers or graft copolymers.<br>
Preferably, the synthetic, bioabsorbable, biocompatible polymers used as the<br>
pharmaceutical carrier 16 in core 12 of microparticles 10 alkyd polymers. Alkyd<br>
polymers have been prepared by several known methods. For example, alkyd-type<br>
polymers were prepared by Van Bemmelen (J. Prakt. Chem., 69 (1856) 84) by<br><br>
condensing succinic anhydride with glycerol. In the "Fatty Acid" method (see<br>
Parkyn, et al. Polyesters (1967), Iliffe Books, London, Vol. 2 and Patton, In: Alkyd<br>
Resins Technology, Wiley-Interscience New York (1962)), a fatty acid, a polyol and<br>
an anhydride are mixed together and allowed to react. The "Fatty Acid-<br>
Monoglyceride" method includes a first step of esterifying the fatty acid with<br>
glycerol and, when the first reaction is complete, adding an acid anhydride. The<br>
reaction mixture then is heated and the polymerization reaction takes place. In the<br>
"Oil-Monoglyceride" method, an oil is reacted with glycerol to form a mixture of<br>
mono-, di-, and triglycerides. This mixture then is polymerized by reacting with an<br>
acid anhydride.<br>
The coating layer 14 of microparticle 10 is an alkyd polymer in the form of a<br>
polymeric wax. The polymeric waxes utilized in the present invention are the<br>
reaction product of a polybasic acid or derivative thereof, a fatty acid, and a polyol,<br>
and may be classified as alkyd polyester waxes. As used herein, a wax is a solid,<br>
low-melting substance that is plastic when warm and, due to its relatively low<br>
molecular weight, is fluid when melted. Preferably, the polymeric waxes of the<br>
present invention are prepared by the polycondensation of a polybasic acid or<br>
derivative thereof and a monoglyceride, wherein the monoglyceride comprises<br>
reactive hydroxy groups and fatty acid groups. The expected hydrolysis byproducts<br>
are glycerol, dicarboxylic acid(s), and fatty acid(s), all of which are biocompatible.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric waxes utilized in the present invention will have a number<br>
average molecular weight between about 1,000 g/mole and about 100,000 g/mole, as<br>
determined by gel permeation chromatography. The polymeric waxes comprise an<br>
aliphatic polyester backbone with pendant fatty acid ester groups that crystallize<br>
rapidly, depending on the fatty acid chain length, and exhibit relatively low melting<br>
points, e.g. less than about 100°C, preferably less than about 70°C. More preferably,<br>
the melting point of the polymeric wax will be between about 25°C and about 70°C.<br>
Typically, the polymeric waxes used in the present invention will be a solid at room<br>
temperature.<br><br>
Fatty acids used to prepare polymeric waxes utilized in the present invention<br>
may be saturated or unsaturated and may vary in length from C)4 to C3o- Examples<br>
of such fatty acids include, without limitation, stearic acid, palmitic acid, myrisitic<br>
acid, caproic acid, decanoic acid, lauric acid, linoleic acid and oleic acid.<br>
Polyols that can be used to prepare the polymeric waxes include, without<br>
limitation, glycols, polyglycerols, polyglycerol esters, glycerol, sugars and sugar<br>
alcohols. Glycerol is a preferred polyhydric alcohol due to its abundance and cost.<br>
Monoglycerides which may be used to prepare polymeric waxes utilized in<br>
the present invention include, without limitation, monostearoyl glycerol,<br>
monopalmitoyl glycerol, monomyrisitoyl glycerol, monocaproyl glycerol,<br>
monodecanoyl glycerol, monolauroyl glycerol, monolinoleoyl glycerol, monooleoyl<br>
glycerol, and combinations thereof. Preferred monoglycerides include monostearoyl<br>
glycerol, monopalmitoyl glycerol and monomyrisitoyl glycerol.<br>
Polybasic acids that can be used include natural multifunctional carboxylic<br>
acids, such as succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, and sebacic acids; hydroxy<br>
acids, such as diglycolic, malic, tartaric and citric acids; and unsaturated acids, such<br>
as fumaric and maleic acids. Polybasic acid derivatives include anhydrides, such as<br>
succinic anhydride, diglycolic anhydride, glutaric anhydride and maleic anhydride,<br>
mixed anhydrides, esters, activated esters and acid halides. The multifunctional<br>
carboxylic acids listed above are preferred.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the polymeric wax may be prepared<br>
from the polybasic acid or derivative thereof, the monoglyceride and, additionally, at<br>
least on additional polyol selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, 1,2-<br>
propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, bis-2-hydroxyethyl ether, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-<br>
pentanediol, 1,6- hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,10-decanediol, 1,12-dodecanediol,<br>
other diols, linear poly(ethylene glycol), branched poly(ethylene glycol), linear<br>
poly(propylene glycol), branched poly(propylene glycol), linear poly(ethylene-co-<br>
propylene glycol)s and branched poly(ethylene-co-propylene glycol)s.<br><br>
In preparing the polymeric waxes utilized in the present invention, the<br>
particular chemical and mechanical properties required of the polymeric wax must<br>
be considered. For example, changing the chemical composition can vary the<br>
physical and mechanical properties, including absorption times. Copolymers can be<br>
prepared by using mixtures of diols, triol, polyols, diacids, triacfds, and different<br>
monoalkanoyl glycerides to match a desired set of properties. Similarly, blends of<br>
two or more alkyd polyesters may be prepared to tailor properties for different<br>
applications.<br>
Alkyd polyester waxes of the present invention can be made more<br>
hydrophobic by increasing the length of the fatty acid side chain or the length of the<br>
diacid in the backbone, or by incorporating a long chain diol. Alternatively, alkyd<br>
polyester waxes of the present invention can be made more hydrophilic or<br>
amphiphilic by employing hydroxy acids, such as malic, tartaric and citric acids, or<br>
some oxadiacids, in the composition, or by employing poly(ethylene glycol)s or<br>
copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, commonly known as<br>
Pluronics, in the formation of segmented block copolymers.<br>
Copolymers containing other linkages in addition to an ester linkage also<br>
may be synthesized; for example, ester-amides, ester-carbonates, ester-anhydrides<br>
and ester urethanes, to name a few.<br>
Multifunctional monomers may be used to produce cross-linked polymeric<br>
wax networks. Alternatively, double bonds may be introduced by using polyols,<br>
polyacids or fatty acids containing at least one double bond to allow<br>
photocrosslinking. Hydrogels may be prepared using this approach provided the<br>
polymer is sufficiently water soluble or swellable.<br>
Functionalized polymeric waxes can be prepared by appropriate choice of<br>
monomers. Polymers having pendant hydroxyls can be synthesized using a hydroxy<br>
acid such as malic or tartaric acid in the synthesis. Polymers with pendent amines,<br>
carboxyls or other functional groups also may be synthesized.<br><br>
The polymerization of the alkyd polyester preferably is performed under<br>
melt polycondensation conditions in the presence of an organometallic catalyst at<br>
elevated temperatures. The organometallic catalyst preferably is a tin-based catalyst<br>
e.g. stannous octoate. The catalyst preferably will be present in the mixture at a<br>
mole ratio of polyol and polycarboxylic acid to catalyst in the range of from about<br>
15,000/1 to 80,000/1. The reaction preferably is performed at a temperature no less<br>
than about 120°C. Higher polymerization temperatures may lead to further increases<br>
in the molecular weight of the copolymer, which may be desirable for numerous<br>
applications. The exact reaction conditions chosen will depend on numerous<br>
factors, including the properties of the polymer desired, the viscosity of the reaction<br>
mixture, and melting temperature of the polymer. The preferred reaction conditions<br>
of temperature, time and pressure can be readily determined by assessing these and<br>
other factors.<br>
Generally, the reaction mixture will be maintained at about 180°C. The<br>
polymerization reaction can be allowed to proceed at this temperature until the<br>
desired molecular weight and percent conversion is achieved for the copolymer,<br>
which typically will take from about 15 minutes to 24 hours. Increasing the reaction<br>
temperature generally decreases the reaction time needed to achieve a particular<br>
molecular weight.<br>
In another embodiment, copolymers of alkyd polyesters can be prepared by<br>
forming an alkyd polyester prepolymer polymerized under melt polycondensation<br>
conditions, then adding at least one lactone monomer or lactone prepolymer. The<br>
mixture then would be subjected to the desired conditions of temperature and time to<br>
copolymerize the prepolymer with the lactone monomers.<br>
The molecular weight of the prepolymer, as well as its composition, can be varied<br>
depending on the desired characteristic that the prepolymer is to impart to the<br>
copolymer. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the alkyd polyester<br>
prepolymers described herein can also be made from mixtures of more than one diol<br>
or dioxycarboxylic acid.<br><br>
The polymers, copolymers and blends of the present invention can be cross-<br>
linked to affect mechanical properties. Cross-linking can be accomplished by the<br>
addition of cross-linking enhancers, irradiation, e.g. gamma-irradiation, or a<br>
combination of both. In particular, cross-linking can be used to control the amount<br>
of swelling that the materials of this invention experience in water.<br>
One of the beneficial properties of the alkyd polyester of this invention is<br>
that the ester linkages are hydrolytically unstable, and therefore the polymer is<br>
bioabsorbable because it readily breaks down into small segments when exposed to<br>
moist body tissue. In this regard, while it is envisioned that co-reactants could be<br>
incorporated into the reaction mixture of the polybasic acid and the diol for the<br>
formation of the alkyd polyester, it is preferable that the reaction mixture does not<br>
contain a concentration of any co-reactant which would render the subsequently<br>
prepared polymer nonabsorbable. Preferably, the reaction mixture is substantially<br>
free of any such co-reactants if the resulting polymer is rendered nonabsorbable.<br>
To form core 12 of microparticle 10, the polymer used as pharmaceutical<br>
carrier 16 in core 12 would be mixed with an effective amount of therapeutic agent<br>
18. Common microencapsulation methods include rotating disk, spray drying,<br>
fluidized bed, or three-phase emulsion techniques.<br>
The preferred technique for preparing drug-containing microparticles of the<br>
present invention is the use of a rotating disk technique. The polymer used as<br>
pharmaceutical carrier 16 in core 12 would be blended with therapeutic agent 18 at a<br>
temperature above the melting point of the polymer. The blend is then fed at a<br>
controlled rate to the center of a rotary disk that is heated to ensure that the blend<br>
remained in a liquid state on the surface of the disk. The rotation of the disk causes<br>
a thin liquid film of drug/polymer blend to be formed on the surface the disk. The<br>
liquid film is thrown radially outward from the surface of the disk and droplets<br>
solidify as before they are collected. The processing is done under a nitrogen<br>
blanket to prevent polymer degradation at the elevated temperatures. The<br>
microparticles made using this process had a mean particle size of about 50-150   m.<br><br>
The polymeric waxes described above are used in coating layer 14 of<br>
microparticle 10. The polymeric wax may be applied as a coating using<br>
conventional fluidized bed coating processes. In the fluidized bed coating process,<br>
microparticles formed as described above are first suspended in an upwardly-<br>
moving gas stream in a coating chamber. The polymeric wax coating material,<br>
dissolved in a solvent, or, preferably as a melt, is sprayed into the moving fluid bed<br>
of microparticles to coat the microparticles. The coated microparticles are recovered,<br>
and any residual solvent is removed.<br>
Most preferably, the polymeric waxes of the current invention are used as<br>
both the pharmaceutical carrier 16 and the coating layer 14 of microparticle 10. In<br>
this embodiment, the bond between coating layer 14 and core 16 should be<br>
excellent. The amount of polymeric wax to be applied on the surface of<br>
microparticle 10 can be readily determined empirically, and will depend on the<br>
specific application where a sustained release or a moderately sustained release is<br>
need.<br>
Suitable diluents and carriers are those which are generally useful in<br>
pharmaceutical formulations for aid in injection purposes. Diluents include, but are<br>
not limited to, physiological saline solution; vegetable oil; a glycol base solvent such<br>
as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol formal or the mixture of them;<br>
mono, di and triglycerides and the like. Viscosity enhancing agents as diluents<br>
include, but are not limited to, aqueous solution of any one from the following or a<br>
mixture selected from at lease two of: alginic acid, bentonite, carbomer,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carborymethylcellulose sodium, carragenan,<br>
cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose disodium, dextrin, gelatine, guar gum,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyproyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
magnesium aluminium silicate, methylcellulose, pectin, polyethylene oxide, silicon<br>
dioxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium alginate, Tragacanth, xanthan gum. The<br>
aqueous solution of those viscosity-enhancing agents as diluents may also contain a<br>
surfactant.<br><br>
Suitable excipients and stabilizers are those which are generally useful in<br>
pharmaceutical formulations. Among the ingredients useful for such preparations the<br>
following are of special interest: acidifying agents (citric acid, fumaric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, malic acid, phosphoric acid, propkmic acid, sulfuric acid, and<br>
tartaric acid), alkalizing agents (ammonia solution, ammonium carbonate, potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, sodium<br>
hydroxide, di-sodium tartrate, and succinic acid-disodium hexahydrate), and<br>
antioxidants (1-ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, calcium ascorbate, and dilauryl<br>
thiodipropionate).<br>
The variety of therapeutic agents 18 that can be used in the coated<br>
microparticles 10 of the invention is vast. In general, therapeutic agents which may<br>
be administered via pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include, without<br>
limitation, antiinfectives, such as antibiotics and antiviral agents; analgesics and<br>
analgesic combinations; anorexics; antihelmintics; antiarthritics; antiasthmatic<br>
agents; anticonvulsants; antidepressants; antidiuretic agents; antidiarrheals;<br>
antihistamines; antiinflamrnatory agents; antimigraine preparations; antinauseants;<br>
antineoplastics; antiparkinsonism drugs; antipruritics; antipsychotics; antipyretics,<br>
antispasmodics; anticholinergics; sympathomimetics; xanthine derivatives;<br>
cardiovascular preparations including calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers<br>
such as pindolol and antiarrhythmics; antihypertensives; diuretics; vasodilators,<br>
including general coronary, peripheral and cerebral; central nervous system<br>
stimulants; cough and cold preparations, including decongestants; hormones, such as<br>
estradiol and other steroids, including corticosteroids; hypnotics;<br>
immunosuppressives; muscle relaxants; parasympatholytics; psychostimulants;<br>
sedatives; tranquilizers; naturally derived or genetically engineered proteins,<br>
polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or lipoproteins; oligonucleotides, antibodies,<br>
antigens, cholinergics, chemotherapeutics, hemostatics, clot dissolving agents,<br>
radioactive agents and cystostatics.<br><br>
The microparticles may be administered in any suitable dosage form such as<br>
oral, parenteral, subcutaneously as an implant, vaginally or as a suppository. The<br>
therapeutic agent may be present as a liquid, a finely divided solid, or any other<br>
appropriate physical form. Typically, but optionally, the microparticles will include<br>
one or more additives, such as, but not limited to, nontoxic auxiliary substances such<br>
as diluents, carriers, excipients, stabilizers or the like. Other suitable additives may<br>
be formulated with the polymeric wax and therapeutic agent or compound.<br>
The amount of therapeutic agent will be dependent upon the particular drug<br>
employed and medical condition being treated. Typically, the amount of agent<br>
represents about 0.001% to about 70%, more typically about 0.001% to about 50%,<br>
most typically about 0.001% to about 20% by weight of the core of the<br>
microparticle.<br>
The quantity and type of alkyd polyester wax incorporated into the parenteral<br>
will vary depending on the release profile desired and the amount of agent<br>
employed. The product may contain blends of polyesters to provide the desired<br>
release profile or consistency to a given formulation.<br>
The alkyd polyester wax, upon contact with body fluids including blood or<br>
the like, undergoes gradual degradation, mainly through hydrolysis, with<br>
concomitant release of the dispersed therapeutic agentfor a sustained or extended<br>
period, as compared to the release from an isotonic saline solution. This can result<br>
in prolonged delivery, e.g. over about 1 to about 2,000 hours, preferably about 2 to<br>
about 800 hours) of effective amounts, e.g. 0.0001 mg/kg/hour to 10 mg/kg/hour) of<br>
the agent. This dosage form can be administered as is necessary depending on the<br>
subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the judgment of the prescribing<br>
physician, and the like.<br>
Individual formulations of therapeutic agents and alkyd polyester wax may<br>
be tested in appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to achieve the desired agent<br>
release profiles. For example, an agent could be formulated with an alkyd polyester<br>
wax and orally administered to an animal. The release profile could then be<br><br>
monitored by appropriate means, such as by taking blood samples at specific times<br>
and assaying the samples for agent concentration. Following this or similar<br>
procedures, those skilled in the art will be able to formulate a variety of<br>
formulations.<br>
The examples set forth below are for illustration purposes only, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention in any way. Numerous<br>
additional embodiments within the scope and spirit of the invention will become<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the examples below, the synthesized polymeric waxes were characterized<br>
via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC),<br>
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. DSC measurements were<br>
performed on a 2920 Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter from TA<br>
Instruments using aluminum sample pans and sample weights of 5-10 mg. Samples<br>
were heated from room temperature to 100°C at 10°C/minute; quenched to -40°C at<br>
30°C/minute followed by heating to 100°C at 10°C/minute. For GPC, a Waters<br>
System with Millennium 32 Software and a 410 Refractive Index Detector were<br>
used. Molecular weights were determined relative to polystyrene standards using<br>
THF as the solvent. Proton NMR was obtained in deuterated chloroform on a<br>
400MHz NMR spectrometer using Varian software.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of Poly(monostearoyl glycerol-co-succinate)<br>
The copolymer was made in an 8CV Helicone Mixer Manufactured by<br>
Design Integrated Technology, Inc. of Warrenton, Virginia. 2510.5 grams<br>
(6.998moles) of monostearoyl glycerol was weighed into a polyethylene bage. 700.4<br>
grams (7.004 moles) of Succinic Anhydride was added to a 3 liter glass beaker. The<br>
1.41 ml of a 0.33 Molar Stannous Octoate solution is drawn into a 2.00 ml glass<br>
syringe. All 3 materials are covered and transferred to the 8CV reactor. The stirrer<br>
turned on to 8rpm reverse for 30 minutes then the reactor was left under full vacuum<br>
for at least 5 hours. The vacuum was 0.43mmHg. Oil jacket temperature was set at<br><br>
180 °C. Stirring was set at 8 rpm reverse. Recorded the time of oil jacket inlet<br>
temperature had reached 18O°C as time zero for polymerization. Reaction lasted for<br>
46.5 hours at 180 °C. Polymer was discharged into clean aluminum pie pan. Once<br>
the solution crystallized, it was deglassed and cleaned of any glass fragments. The<br>
polymer was an amber colored solid.<br>
DSC measurements found a melt temperature of 46.84°C, and a specific heat<br>
of 63.57J/gm. GPC measurement determined a number average molecular weight of<br>
2,932, and a weight average molecular weight of 38,422. The *H NMR showed the<br>
following peaks: 5 0.86 triplet (3H), 1.26 multiplet (28H), 1.61 multiplet (2H), 2.30<br>
multiplet (2H), 2.65 multiplet (4H), 4.16 multiplet (2H), 4.34 multiplet (2H), and<br>
5.28 multiplet (2H).<br>
Example 2: Sustained Release of Risperidone from Poly(monostearoyl glycerol-co-<br>
succinate) Microparticles in vitro,<br>
Poly(monostearoyl glycerol-co-succinate), or MGS A, polymer was prepared<br>
as described in Example 1. 10 grams of the polymer was placed in a 50-ml beaker<br>
and heated to 110°C to melt the polymer. 3.34 grams of a drug in the form of a<br>
powder, Risperidone, sold by Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc., Beerse, Belgium, under<br>
the tradename RISPERDAL, was dispersed and suspended into the polymer melt<br>
using a magnetic stirrer to form a 25 percent by weight drug in polymer blend. A<br>
gradient heating mechanism was used to limit the exposure of the drug to the<br>
polymer melt at elevated temperature to few seconds.<br>
The drug/polymer blend was converted to drug/polymer microparticles on a<br>
rotating disk apparatus. The drug/polymer blend first was equilibrated to 110°C and<br>
then fed at a controlled rate of 3.5 grams/sec to the center of a 4-inch rotary disk that<br>
was run at 8000 rpm. The disk surface was heated using an induction heating<br>
mechanism to 130°C to ensure that the drug/polymer blend was in a liquid state on<br>
the surface of the disk. The rotation of the disk caused a thin liquid film of<br>
drug/polymer blend to be formed on the surface the disk. The liquid film was<br>
thrown radially outward from the surface of the disk and droplets solidified upon<br><br>
contact with nitrogen in the rotating disk apparatus chamber to form drug/polymer<br>
microparticles. The processing was conducted under a nitrogen blanket to prevent<br>
polymer degradation at elevated temperatures. The solid microparticles were then<br>
collected using a cyclone separator. The Risperidone loaded MGSA microparticles<br>
made using this process had a mean particle size of about 100 microns.<br>
Three 50-gram batches of blended particles were then prepared by blending<br>
45 grams of sugar spheres (Paulaur Co., Cranbury, NJ), with a size range of between<br>
40 and 60 mesh, and 5 grams of Risperidone loaded MGSA microparticles prepared<br>
above. The sugar spheres and Risperidone loaded MGSA microparticles were<br>
blended in a Wurster Chamber (Niro MP-Micro precision coater, Aeromatic-Fielder<br>
Ltd., Eastleigh Hampshire, UK).<br>
Coating solution was prepared by dissolving 25 grams of MGSA polymer<br>
prepared in Example 1 in 100 grams of chloroform.<br>
Three samples of coated particles were then prepared. For the first sample,<br>
one batch of blended particles was loaded into a fluidized coater (Niro MP-Micro<br>
precision coater, Aeromatic-Fielder Ltd., Eastleigh Hampshire, UK). 1.8 grams of<br>
MGSA/chloroform solution was then added to the fluidized coater.The coating<br>
parameters were set as follows:<br>
Atomization pressure	2.0 Bar<br>
Atomization nozzle	0.8 mm<br>
Inlet temperature	55.0 °C<br>
Outlet temperature	31 -32 °C<br>
Flow rate of coating solution 0.5 grams/min<br>
Fluidization air volume	2.50-3.50 m3/h<br>
Coated particles were collected from the fluidized coater and sieved to a size<br>
range of between 40 and 60 mesh. The MGSA coating on the coated particles was<br>
approximately 9 percent by weight.<br><br>
Following the same coating procedure as outlined above, coated particles<br>
with approximately 20 and 30 percent by weight of MGSA coating were prepared.<br>
In these cases, however 4 and 6 grams, respectively, of MGSA/chloroform solution<br>
was then added to the fluidized coater.<br>
All coated particles were stored in a vacuum oven until further testing was<br>
conducted.<br>
In vitro release studies were performed with the coated particles in a buffer<br>
medium under physiological conditions. Approximately 20 mg of coated particles<br>
were placed in 50-ml test tubes. 30 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution were<br>
added to the test tubes. The test tubes were placed in a constant temperature water<br>
bath, and kept at 37°C for the duration of the test. To determine drug release from<br>
the coated particles at each time point, 5 ml of buffer was removed and filtered<br>
through a 0.2    m filter. The amount of drug released was determined by HPLC<br>
measurements on an HP 1100 instrument against risperidone standards.<br>
In vitro release versus time for the coated particles is shown in Figure 2. The<br>
figure shows that risperidone release decreases with increasing coating level.<br>
Example 3: Sustained Release of Theophylline from Poly(monostearoyl glycerol-co-<br>
succinate) Microparticles in vitro.<br>
Poly(monostearoyl glycerol-co-succinate) polymer was prepared as<br>
described in Example 1. Appropriate amounts of polymer were melted as described<br>
in Example 2, and blended with amounts of a drug, Theophylline, as described in<br>
Example 2, to form 25% drug in polymer blends.<br>
The drug/polymer blend was converted to drug/polymer microparticles on a<br>
rotating disk apparatus, and coated with different levels of poly(monostearoy)<br>
gjycerol-co-succinate) polymer as described in Example 2. In vitro release studies<br>
were performed with these microparticles in a buffer medium at physiological<br>
conditions as described in Example 3, and release coated microparticles is shown in<br>
Figure 3. The figure shows that increasing the polymer coating level on the<br><br>
microparticles decreases both the cumulative theophylline release from coated<br>
microspheres, as well as the burst release in the first hour of the study.<br><br>
