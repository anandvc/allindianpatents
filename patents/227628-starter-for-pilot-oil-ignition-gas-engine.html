STARTER FOR PILOT OIL IGNITION GAS ENGINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1, Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a starter for a precombustion chamber type pilot oil<br>
ignition gas engine in which a precombustion chamber with liquid fuel injection valve is<br>
provided in a cylinder head, and a mixture of air and gaseous fuel that is introduced into<br>
a main combustion chamber and compressed is ignited and burnt by pilot oil injected<br>
from the liquid fuel injection valve.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, the engine shown in FIG. 8 is known as a precombustion chamber<br>
type pilot oil ignition gas engine that drives a stationary type of power generation<br>
installation for industrial or public use.<br>
This type of gas engine 1 has a cylinder liner (cylinder) 2, a piston 3 that moves<br>
reciprocally up and down inside the cylinder liner 2, and a precombustion chamber unit 6<br>
with liquid fuel injection valve that is provided with a liquid fuel injection valve 4 and a<br>
precombustion chamber 5. Fuel gas (gaseous fuel) such as city gas is mixed with air<br>
and is supplied via an intake port of a cylinder head 7 to a main combustion chamber 8<br>
which walls are formed by the cylinder liner 2, the piston 3, and the cylinder head 7. In<br>
addition, in the latter half of the compression stroke of the piston 3, fuel oil<br>
corresponding to approximately 1% of the total quantity of heat is injected as pilot oil<br>
from the liquid fuel injection valve 4 into the precombustion chamber 5. This results in<br>
the pilot oil being compression ignited in a high temperature - high pressure atmosphere<br>
and the fuel gas inside the main combustion chamber 8 is then burnt using the pilot oil as<br>
an ignition source.<br>
A jerk fuel injection pump, which is designed so that a small discharge quantity<br>
can be reliably obtained, is used as the fuel injection pump for supplying fuel oil (i.e.,<br>
pilot oil) to the liquid fuel injection valve 4. Because this jerk fuel injection pump is<br>
driven by revolution of the engine via a camshaft, it is affected by an engine speed. In<br>
this jerk fuel pump, the relationship between the position of the fuel rack (fuel control<br>
rod) which starts fuel injection and the number of engine revolutions (i.e., the engine<br>
speed) is shown in FIG. 7. As can be seen in FIG. 7, the smaller the indicated value for<br>
the fuel rack position that sets the fuel injection quantity, the wider the range of the<br>
engine speed where there is no injection (i.e., the region of the engine revolutions where<br>
injection of the fuel oil from the liquid fuel injection valve 4 is not started). For<br>
example, if the fuel rack position is set to 8 mm, which is the position corresponding to<br>
the discharge quantity of the pilot oil is approximately 1% of the total quantity of heat,<br>
the pilot oil is not injected from the liquid fuel injection valve until the engine speed<br>
reaches approximately 600 rpm.<br>
Furthermore, in this gas engine 1 the compression ratio is lowered in comparison<br>
with a diesel engine in order to avoid knocking during gas operation. Therefore,<br>
particularly when the engine is in transition from starting to run-up, if the injection of<br>
pilot oil from the liquid fuel injection valve has started, compression ignition of this pilot<br>
oil is only achieved with difficulty. In particular, if the engine cooling water is at a low<br>
temperature, the compression ignition becomes noticeably more difficult.<br>
Because the gas engine cannot be started in this state, an ignition device 9, such as<br>
an ignition plug or a glow plug, is provided in addition to the liquid fuel injection valve 4<br>
so that fuel gas introduced into the main combustion chamber 8 is ignited and the engine<br>
is started. However, in this case, because the ignition device 9 is required in addition to<br>
the liquid fuel injection valve 4, problems arise in that the engine structure is more<br>
complex and costs rise due to the increased number of components.<br>
The present invention was conceived in view of the above circumstances and it is<br>
an object thereof to provide a starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine that can reliably<br>
inject pilot oil from a liquid fuel injection valve from the time the engine is started, and<br>
that can smoothly start the engine.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a starter for pilot oil<br>
ignition gas engine that enables compression ignition to be performed stably using pilot<br>
oil when the engine is started even when the engine cooling water is at low temperature.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the aforementioned problems, the present invention has the<br>
following features.<br>
Namely, the first aspect of the present invention is a starter for pilot oil ignition gas<br>
engine in which, in a main combustion chamber partitioned off by a cylinder, a piston<br>
that moves reciprocally inside the cylinder, and a cylinder head having a precombustion<br>
chamber with liquid fuel injection valve, a fuel air mixture made up of a gaseous fuel and<br>
air that is introduced into the main combustion chamber and is compressed by the piston<br>
is ignited by pilot oil injected from the liquid fuel injection valve into the precombustion<br>
chamber and burned thereby enabling the pilot oil ignition gas engine to provide drive<br>
output, wherein there is provided a controller that controls a position of a fuel control rod<br>
that controls a discharge quantity of a fuel injection pump that supplies the pilot oil to the<br>
liquid fuel injection valve based on an engine speed.<br>
In this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, gaseous fuel from a gaseous fuel<br>
supply source Is mixed with air from an intake port of the cylinder head to form a fuel-air<br>
mixture, which is then supplied to the main combustion chamber and compressed by the<br>
piston. A portion of this compressed fuel-air mixture enters the precombustion<br>
chamber and, in the latter half of the compression stroke of the piston, is ignited by pilot<br>
oil injected from the liquid fuel injection valve by the operation of the fuel injection<br>
pumps. The portion of the fuel-air mixture remaining inside the main combustion<br>
chamber is then burned by the flames created by this ignition.<br>
At this time, the controller operates and the position of the fuel control rod that<br>
adjusts the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pumps is controlled based on the<br>
engine speed. As a result, regardless of the engine speed, the discharge quantity of the<br>
fuel injection pumps that cause pilot oil to be injected from the liquid fuel injection valve<br>
is secured.<br>
According to this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, by adjusting the<br>
movement of the fuel control rod to a position where the discharge quantity of the fuel<br>
injection pump in the low speed region of the engine speed is increased, it is possible to<br>
inject pilot oil from the liquid fuel injection valve from the time of starting of the engine.<br>
As a result, the ignition and combustion of a fuel-air mixture of gaseous fuel and air<br>
inside the main combustion chamber is performed with certainty and it is possible to start<br>
the engine smoothly.<br>
The second aspect of the present invention is the starter for pilot oil ignition gas<br>
engine described above, wherein, in a low speed region of the engine speed, the<br>
controller controls the fuel control rod in a position where the discharge quantity of the<br>
fuel injection pump is increased, while, in a high speed region of the engine speed, the<br>
controller controls the fuel control rod in a position where the discharge quantity of the<br>
fuel injection pump is decreased.<br>
In this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, because control is performed by the<br>
controller such that the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pumps increases in the<br>
low speed region of the engine speed, a sufficient quantity of pilot oil needed to start<br>
injectiori is supplied to the liquid fuel injection pump, and the injection of pilot oil from<br>
the liquid fuel injection valves into the precombustion chamber is performed reliably<br>
even at the start of the engine. Moreover, because control is performed by the<br>
controller such that the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pumps decreases in the<br>
high speed region of the engine speed, the supply of superfluous pilot oil to the liquid<br>
fuel injection valve is prevented in the high speed region where a large amount of pilot<br>
oil is not required to start injection by the liquid fuel injection valve, thereby conserving<br>
pilot oil.<br>
The third aspect of the present invention is the starter for pilot oil ignition gas<br>
engine according to the above described second aspect, wherein, in the low speed region<br>
where the engine speed is a predetermined value or less, the position of fuel control rod<br>
is a fixed position where the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is at maximum,<br>
while, in the high speed region where the engine speed is a predetermined value or<br>
greater, the position of fuel control rod is a fixed position where the discharge quantity of<br>
the fuel injection pump is at minimum, while, in an intermediate speed region between<br>
the low speed region and the high speed region, the discharge quantity of the fuel<br>
injection pump changes in accordance with the engine speed from a fixed position where<br>
the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is at maximum to a fixed position<br>
where the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is at minimum.<br>
In this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, because the minimum quantity of<br>
pilot oil needed to start injection by the liquid fuel injection valves in accordance with<br>
the engine speed is supplied from the fuel injection pumps to the liquid fuel injection<br>
valves, pilot oil is used efficiently and the engine is started smoothly.<br>
The fourth aspect of the present invention is the starter for pilot oil ignition gas<br>
engine according to the above described first through third aspects, wherein the<br>
controller is provided with an engine speed sensor that detects the engine speed, a<br>
position control actuator that adjusts a position of the fuel control rod by moving the fuel<br>
control rod, and a control apparatus that, based on a relationship between the engine<br>
speed and a position of the fuei control rod that is set in advance, calculates a control<br>
objective position for the fuel control rod relative to the engine speed detected by the<br>
engine speed sensor, and moves the position control actuator such thai the position of the<br>
fuel control rod is adjusted to the calculated control objective position.<br>
In this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, the position of the fuei control rod is<br>
controlled by the control apparatus using the position control actuator, and the discharge<br>
quantity of the fuel injection pumps is appropriately set to the quantity of pilot oil needed<br>
to start injection by the liquid fuel injection valves in accordance with the engine speed<br>
detected by the engine speed sensor. As a result, the injection of pilot oil from the<br>
liquid fuel injection valves into the precombustion chamber proceeds even more<br>
efficiently and the engine is started smoothly and reliably.<br>
The fifth aspect of the present invention is the starter for pilot oil ignition gas<br>
engine according to the above described first through fourth aspects, wherein, in the<br>
cylinder head there is further provided an ignition device that performs an ignition<br>
operation before the pilot oil is injected from the liquid fuel injection valve, and ignites<br>
the fuel air mixture of gaseous fuel and air that is compressed inside the main<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
In this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, because the ignition and combustion<br>
generated by the ignition of pilot oil from the liquid fuel injection valves is accelerated<br>
by the ignition of a fuel-air mixture of gaseous fuel and air by an ignition device, the rate<br>
of misfire at the time of engine run-up is reduced and combustion stability is improved.<br>
As a result, the total hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas are reduced and explosions in the<br>
exhaust pipe system are avoided, allowing a reduction in the rise time before a rated<br>
speed is reached to be achieved. Note that, the quantity of total hydrocarbons in the<br>
exhaust gas depends to a major extent on the quantity of fuel gas that cannot be burned<br>
completely because of combustion defects and is exhausted from the main combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
The sixth aspect of the present invention is the starter for pilot oil ignition gas<br>
engine according to the above described fifth aspect, wherein the ignition device stops<br>
ignition operation when the engine speed reaches the rated speed.<br>
In this starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine, because the ignition device stops<br>
ignition operation when the engine speed reaches the rated speed, unnecessary use of the<br>
ignition device is prevented thereby extending the lifespan of the ignition device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a starter for pilot oil ignition<br>
gas engine in which, in a main combustion chamber partitioned off by a cylinder,<br>
a piston that moves reciprocally inside the cylinder, and a cylinder head having a<br>
precombustion chamber with a liquid fuel injection valve, a fuel air mixture made<br>
up of a gaseous fuel and air that is introduced into the main combustion<br>
chamber and is compressed by the piston is ignited by pilot oil injected from the<br>
liquid fuel injection valve into the precombustion chamber and burned, thereby<br>
enabling the pilot oil ignition gas engine to provide drive output, wherein there is<br>
provided a controller that controls the position of a fuel control rod that controls a<br>
discharge quantity of a fuel injection pump that supplies the pilot oil to the liquid<br>
fuel injection valve based on an engine speed, and wherein, in a low speed<br>
region of the engine speed, the controller controls the fuel control rod in a<br>
position where a discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is increased, while,<br>
in a high speed region of the engine speed, the controller controls the fuel<br>
control rod in a position where a discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is<br>
decreased.<br>
Preferably, in the low speed region where the engine speed is a<br>
predetermined value or less, the position of fuel control rod is a fixed position<br>
where the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is at maximum, while, in<br>
the high speed region where the engine speed is a predetermined value or<br>
greater, the position of fuel control rod is a fixed position where the discharge<br>
quantity of the fuel injection pump is at minimum, while, in an intermediate speed<br>
region between the low speed region and the high speed region, the discharge<br>
quantity of the fuel injection pump changes in accordance with the engine speed<br>
from the fixed position where the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pump is<br>
at maximum to the fixed position where the discharge quantity of the fuel<br>
injection pump is at minimum. Preferably, in the cylinder head there is provided<br>
an ignition device that performs an ignition operation before the pilot oil is<br>
injected from the liquid fuel injection valve, and ignites the fuel air mixture of<br>
gaseous fuel and air that is compressed inside the main combustion chamber. In<br>
the cylinder head there may is provided an ignition device that performs an<br>
ignition operation before the pilot oil is injected from the liquid fuel injection valve,<br>
and ignites the fuel air mixture of gaseous fuel and air that is compressed inside<br>
the main combustion chamber. In an alternative embodiment, in the cylinder<br>
head there is provided an ignition device that performs an ignition operation<br>
before the pilot oil is injected from the liquid fuel injection valve, and ignites the<br>
fuel air mixture of gaseous fuel and air that is compressed inside the main<br>
combustion chamber. Preferably, the ignition device stops ignition operation<br>
when the engine speed reaches a rated speed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference made<br>
to the attached drawings.<br>
In FIG. 1, 10 is a pilot oil ignition gas engine (hereinafter abbreviated to "gas<br>
engine"). This pilot oil ignition gas engine 10 forms a portion of a stationary power<br>
generation installation as a result of a power generator 12 being linked via a coupling 11<br>
to an output shaft thereof.<br>
In the same manner as for the conventional pilot oil ignition gas engine 1 shown in<br>
FIG. 8, the gas engine 10 has a structure in which a cylinder head 7 is mounted on a<br>
cylinder liner 2 inside which is inserted a piston 3. Inside the cylinder head 7, the gas<br>
engine 10 is further provided with an ignition device 9 and also with a precombustion<br>
chamber unit 6 with liquid fuel injection valve that is provided with a liquid fuel<br>
injection valve 4 and a precombustion chamber 5. The description below of portions<br>
peripheral to the combustion chamber, such as the cylinder head 7 of the gas engine 10,<br>
is based, according to necessity, on FIG. 8.<br>
In FIG. 1, 13 is a jerk fuel injection pump (i.e., a fuel injection pump) provided for<br>
each cylinder head 7 of the gas engine 10. The jerk fuel injection pumps 13 are driven<br>
by camshafts linked via a gear train, which is formed by an intermediate gear or the like,<br>
to a crankshaft of the gas engine 10, and are set such that a small amount of oil is<br>
injected in a stable manner. Pilot oil discharged from the fuel injection pumps 13 is<br>
supplied via pilot oil pipes (not shown) to the liquid fuel injection valves 4 provided in<br>
each cylinder head 7.<br>
A fuel rack (i.e., a fuel control rod) 14 is linked to each fuel injection pump 13 and<br>
simultaneously operates mechanism portions that set the discharge quantity of pilot oil in<br>
each fuel injection pump 13. The position of the fuel rack 14 can be moved by the<br>
operation of a rack control actuator (i.e., a position control actuator) 15 linked to the fuel<br>
rack 14. In addition, the discharge quantity of pilot oil is set relative to the position of<br>
the fuel rack 14.<br>
The rack control actuator 15 is constructed such that it is moved as a result of an<br>
operating rod being pulled by an electromagnetic coil, and the distance of the movement<br>
of the operating rod is set by the size of quantity of electricity supplied to the<br>
electromagnetic coil. An example of a relationship between the position of the fuel<br>
rack 14 moved by the rack control actuator 15 and the size of the quantity of electricity<br>
(i.e., the current) supplied to the rack control actuator 15 is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
16 is a speed sensor that detects the engine speed of the gas engine 10. The speed<br>
sensor 16 is formed by a magnetic pickup or the like, and is positioned so as to face teeth<br>
surfaces of a ring gear 17 mounted on the crankshaft of the gas engine 10. The speed<br>
sensor 16 detects the teeth surfaces of the ring gear 17 and sends pulses that are thereby<br>
generated to a control apparatus 18. The control apparatus 18 counts the pulses sent<br>
from the speed sensor 16 per unit time, measures the number of engine revolutions (i.e.,<br>
the engine speed), and calculates a position for the fuel rack 14 that is the control<br>
objective for that particular engine speed (i.e., a control objective position) based on a<br>
control objective line C2 of the relationship between the engine speed and the position of<br>
the fuel rack shown in FIG. 3.<br>
In addition, the control apparatus 18 determines the quantity of electricity<br>
corresponding to the control objective position calculated for the fuel rack 14 based on<br>
the relationship shown in FIG. 2, and this is then output to the rack control actuator 15 as<br>
a command signal.<br>
A controller 19 that controls the position of the fuel rack 14, which adjusts the<br>
discharge quantity of the fuel injection pumps 13, based on the engine speed is formed<br>
by the rack control actuator 15, the speed sensor 16, and the control apparatus 18.<br>
Note that the relationship between the engine speed and the position of the fuel<br>
rack 14 shown in FIG. 3 is determined by the following process. An injection testing<br>
apparatus or a pilot oil ignition gas engine testing apparatus is operated beforehand, and,<br>
for each position of the fuel rack 14, if the injection quantity of pilot oil from the liquid<br>
fuel injection valves 4 relative to the engine speed is measured, the characteristics shown<br>
in FIG. 4 are obtained. FIG. 3 shows the results obtained when, from the characteristics<br>
shown in FIG. 4, the minimum engine speed in the injection region where the injection<br>
of pilot oil from the liquid fuel injection valve 14 is commenced is determined at each<br>
position of the fuel rack 14, and this minimum engine speed is then corresponded to the<br>
position of the fuel rack 14. From the results shown in FIG. 3, the characteristic curve<br>
C1 showing the boundary between the injection region and the non-injection region is<br>
obtained.<br>
Using the control objective line C2, in the low engine speed region (the low speed<br>
region) where the engine speed is 200 rpm or less, the control objective position of the<br>
fuel rack 14 is set at a fixed position of 15 mm, at which position the liquid fuel injection<br>
valves 4 inject pilot oil, with a quantity of pilot oil corresponding to a quantity of heat<br>
ratio of approximately 8% of the quantity of heat required for rated load operation of the<br>
engine taken as the maximum injection quantity. Moreover, in the high engine speed<br>
region (the high speed region) where the engine speed is 800 rpm or more, the control<br>
objective position of the fuel rack 14 is set at a fixed position of 8 mm at which position<br>
pilot oil corresponding to 1 %, as quantity of heat ratio, is injected. Furthermore, in the<br>
intermediate speed region between the low speed region and the high speed region, the<br>
control objective position of the fuel rack 14 is set so as to become gradually smaller<br>
from a position of 15 mm to a position of 8 mm.<br>
Moreover, in the region where the engine speed is 150 rpm or more, the control<br>
objective position of the fuel rack is set using the control objective line C2 such that<br>
there is a displacement from the characteristic curve C1 that forms the boundary between<br>
injection region and the non-injection region of the liquid fuel injection valve 4. In<br>
contrast, in a conventional gas engine, as is shown by the control objective line C3, the<br>
control objective position of the fuel rack 14 is set at a uniform fixed position regardless<br>
of the engine speed. As is clear from a comparison of the control objective lines C2 and<br>
C3, in the present invention, injection of pilot oil is performed reliably over a wider<br>
range of the engine speed than is the case with a conventional gas engine.<br>
Next, the operation of the starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine 10 having the<br>
above described structure will be described.<br>
At the starting of the gas engine 10, if fuel gas (i.e., a gaseous fuel) from a gaseous<br>
fuel supply source (not shown) is introduced into an intake port or the like of the cylinder<br>
head 7, starting of the gas engine 10 is commenced by a starter. The gaseous fuel and<br>
air are mixed together in the intake port or the like to form a fuel-air mixture that is then<br>
supplied to the main combustion chamber 8. This fuel-air mixture is compressed by the<br>
piston 3 inside the main combustion chamber 8. A portion of the compressed fuel-air<br>
mixture goes into the precombustion chamber 5 and, in the latter half of the compression<br>
stroke of the piston 3, is ignited by pilot oil injected from the liquid fuel injection valves<br>
4 by the operation of the fuel injection pumps 13. The portion of the fuel-air mixture<br>
remaining inside the main combustion chamber 8 is then burned by the flames created by<br>
the ignition, causing the gas engine 10 to commence revolution.<br>
When the gas engine 10 commences revolution, the gaseous fuel supplied to the<br>
interior of the main combustion chamber 8 is increased by the operation of an engine<br>
governor. As a result, the engine speed of the gas engine 10 gradually increases and<br>
reaches a rated speed after a predetermined time.<br>
At the starting of the gas engine 10, the controller 19 operates such that the control<br>
apparatus 18 thereof counts the pulses detected by the speed sensor 16 and calculates the<br>
engine speed. The control apparatus 18 then determines a control objective position for<br>
the fuel rack that corresponds to the calculated engine speed based on the control<br>
objective line C2 shown in FIG. 3. Because the maximum control objective position<br>
corresponding to the low engine speed region is set by the control objective line C2, the<br>
control apparatus 18 sends a signal commanding a large quantity of electricity<br>
corresponding to this control objective position to the rack control actuator 15. As a<br>
result, the rack control actuator 15 moves the position of the fuel rack 14 by the<br>
maximum distance, and the fuel injection pumps 13 are adjusted such that the maximum<br>
quantity of pilot oil is discharged.<br>
Because of this, the quantity of pilot oil discharged from the fuel injection pumps<br>
13 (i.e., the quantity of compressed oil) is increased, and the oil pressure inside the pilot<br>
oil pipes linking the fuel injection pumps 13 to the liquid fuel injection valves 4 is raised<br>
enough for pilot oil to be reliably injected from the liquid fuel injection valves 4 even at<br>
a low engine speed. As a result, the ignition and burning of fuel-air mixture inside the<br>
main combustion chamber 8 is reliably performed, and starting of the gas engine 10 is<br>
achieved smoothly.<br>
Note that, even if the position of the fuel rack 14 at starting of the gas engine 10 is<br>
set to the maximum control objective position, the maximum discharge quantity from the<br>
fuel injection pumps 13 does not exceed the quantity of heat ratio of approximately 8%<br>
relative to when the engine is operating at rated load operation, as described above.<br>
Accordingly, it is not possible to generate sufficient torque to raise the gas engine 10 to<br>
the rated speed, and no obstacle to the operation of the gas engine 10, namely, to the<br>
control of the engine speed by the engine governor is created.<br>
If the engine speed of the gas engine 10 is raised, the control apparatus 18 adjusts<br>
the control objective position of the fuel rack 14 such that it is gradually lowered from<br>
the maximum position, in accordance with the control objective line C2 shown in FIG. 3,<br>
based on the results of detections by the speed sensor 16. At a predetermined engine<br>
speed or higher, the rack control actuator 15 adjusts the position of the liquid fuel<br>
injection valve to the control objective position such that approximately 1%, as a<br>
quantity of heat percentage, of pilot oil is injected from the liquid fuel injection pump 14.<br>
As a result, in the high engine speed region of the gas engine 10, the fuel-air mixture<br>
inside the main combustion chamber 8 is ignited and burned by the injection of a small<br>
quantity of pilot oil, and the engine is put into operation.<br>
In the operation of the gas engine 10, changes in the respective control objectives<br>
(i.e., the position of the fuel rack 14, the engine speed, the quantity of fuel gas supplied,<br>
and the ON/ OFF operations of the ignition plugs) at engine revolution startup as well as<br>
changes in the quantities of state thereof over time from the starting of the engine are as<br>
shown in FIG. 5.<br>
In this example, over a predetermined time after the starting of the engine, the<br>
ignition plugs (ignition devices) 9 provided in the cylinder head 7 are operated so that the<br>
fuel-air mixture inside the main combustion chamber 8 is ignited. If a structure such as<br>
this is employed, because the precombustion chamber 5 is heated by heat generated by<br>
the ignition and combustion of the fuel-air mixture so that the compression ignition of<br>
the pilot oil injected from the liquid fuel injection valves 4 is accelerated, the ratio of<br>
misfires at engine run-up is reduced and the combustion stability is improved. As a<br>
result, the total hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas are reduced and explosions in the<br>
exhaust pipe system are avoided, allowing a reduction in the rise time before the rated<br>
speed is reached to be achieved.<br>
The operating time of the ignition of the ignition plug 9 is set to the<br>
commencement time of the starting, and the ignition plug 9 ignites either simultaneously<br>
or immediately prior to the injection of pilot oil from the liquid fuel combustion valve 4.<br>
The stopping time of the ignition is set to the point when the rated speed of the gas<br>
engine 10 is detected by the speed sensor 16, or the point when it is detected that the<br>
voltage generated by the generator 12 has reached a rated voltage. By employing a<br>
structure such as this, unnecessary operation of the ignition plug 9 is restricted and the<br>
lifespan thereof is lengthened.<br>
According to this starter for the pilot oil ignition gas engine 10, in the low engine<br>
speed region, because the fuel control rod 14 is moved to a control objective position<br>
where the discharge quantity of the fuel injection pumps 13 is increased, it is possible for<br>
pilot oil fed from the fuel injection pumps 13 to be injected from the liquid fuel injection<br>
valves 4 into the precombustion chamber 5 even in the low engine speed region at the<br>
starting of the engine. As a result, the ignition and combustion of fuel-air mixture<br>
formed by gaseous fuel and air inside the main combustion chamber 8 is reliably<br>
performed and a smooth engine start can be obtained.<br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B show the results recorded when a pilot oil ignition gas engine test<br>
apparatus having a single cylinder with a cylinder diameter of 260 mm is operated with<br>
the fuel rack position set to 8 mm or 15 mm and the ignition plug having been in<br>
operation from starting. The data for starting of engine is made up of the pressure a<br>
inside the pilot oil pipe, the valve lift b of the liquid fuel injection valve, the pressure c<br>
inside the gaseous fuel supply pipe, the engine speed d, and the pressure e inside the<br>
main combustion chamber. A and B correspond to the position of the fuel rack being<br>
set to 8 mm and 15 mm respectively.<br>
When the position of the fuel rack is set to 8 mm, as is shown in FIG. 6A, the<br>
pressure a inside the pilot oil pipe has not reached the pressure required to open the<br>
liquid fuel injection valve. Therefore, the pilot oil is not injected from the liquid fuel<br>
injection valve (there is no valve lift b signal). Moreover, as a result of the fuel gas (i.e.,<br>
the gaseous fuel) being supplied from the third cycle S3 after starting and thereafter (the<br>
action of the pressure c inside the gaseous fuel supply pipe), and then being burned by a<br>
spark ignition of the ignition plugs, the engine speed d increases. However, this<br>
increase proceeds slowly and the pressure e inside the main combustion chamber is also<br>
low.<br>
In contrast, when the position of the fuel rack is set to 15 mm, as is shown in FIG.<br>
6B, the pressure a inside the pilot oil pipe has reached a sufficient pressure to open the<br>
liquid fuel injection valve from the first starting cycle S1, and the pilot oil is injected<br>
from the liquid fuel injection valve (there is a valve lift b signal). Accordingly, the<br>
pressure e inside the main combustion chamber also increases due to the burning of the<br>
fuel-air mixture to accompany the supply of fuel gas from the third cycle S3, and the<br>
run-up in the engine speed becomes faster.<br>
From these results it was evident that, in the pilot oil ignition gas engine, if the<br>
position of the fuel rack of the fuel injection pump is set at engine starting such that<br>
quantity of pilot oil that is discharged is increased, then the liquid fuel injection valve is<br>
placed in a state in which it opens more easily. In addition, the pilot oil is reliably<br>
injected from the liquid fuel injection valves into the precombustion chamber, ignited,<br>
and burnt, resulting in the starting of the engine proceeding smoothly and reliably.<br>
Namely, the effectiveness of the starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine of the present<br>
invention was confirmed.<br>
Note that, in the starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine of the above described<br>
embodiment, a mode was employed in which the rack control actuator 15 is moved by an<br>
electromagnetic coil pulling an operating rod, however, instead of this, it is also possible<br>
to employ a structure in which a rotation of an electric servomotor is converted into a<br>
rectilinear motion by a bolt mechanism formed by screwing a nut onto a bolt shaft, and<br>
for the fuel rack 14 to be moved by this rectilinear motion. In this case, by controlling<br>
the quantity of electricity supplied to the electric servomotor, the amount of rotation<br>
thereof can be adjusted thereby enabling the position of the fuel rack 14 to be adjusted.<br>
Furthermore, the rack control actuator 15 may be a hydraulic servo cylinder and is not<br>
particularly restricted provided that it is able to move the fuel rack 14 to a predetermined<br>
position in response to a command from the control apparatus 18.<br>
Moreover, in the starter for pilot oil ignition gas engine of the above described<br>
embodiment, a structure is employed in which the engine speed is measured using pulses<br>
generated by the detection of teeth surfaces of a ring gear 17 mounted on a crank shaft<br>
using an electromagnetic pickup or the like, however, instead of this it is also possible<br>
measure the engine speed by directly measuring the number of revolutions of a camshaft<br>
or some other shaft that rotates in conjunction with the engine crankshaft using a tacho<br>
generator or the like.<br>
