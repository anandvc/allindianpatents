				<td>ABSTRACT A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A NOVEL HERBAL ANTI-MAGGOT AND TOPICAL CARE COMPOSITION The present invention comprises taking the distillates of Cedrus, Eucalyptus and Firms and mixing with emulsifier thoroughly. To this mixture the extract of Curcuma is added which is solublised in a solvent using excipients and mixed thoroughly. To the resulting mixture is then added a propellent base (L.P.G) or a cream base or a lotion base, in order to obtain an antimaggot aerosol spray or a cream or a lotion, respectively. The resulting composition has powerful anti-maggot, anti-microbial and wound healing (vulnerary) activities.</td>

It is employed as a stimulating application for ulcer, abscesses and wounds and as a basis for plasters and an ingredient in ointments. Oleoresin from Pinus longifolia is the main source of turpentine oil in the country. Turpentine oil is a clear, transparent liquid with a pungeht and somewhat bitter taste. The Indian turpentine is chiefly used in Pharmaceutical preparations, perfumery industry, manufacture of the synthetic pine oil disinfectants, insecticides and denaturants. During its elimination through the mucus membrane of the lungs it acts as an expectorant and is useful in chronic bronchitis. It is especially recommended in the treatment of gangrenes of the lungs. Externally it is used as a rubefacient in various rheumatic effects and its is used as a counter irritant in various deep seated inflammations.<br>
Curcuma: It is well known that this plant is used in various diseases both externally internally. The rhizome is bitter, thermogenic, emollient, anodyne, anti-inflammatory, vulnerary, depurative, appetiser, carminative, stomachic. It is used in inflammations, ulcers, wounds and skin diseases. Curcumin isolated from rhizome was found to inhibit the carrageenan induced .' oedema in rats as well as in mice. Cured turmeric rhizomes contain volatile oil, pigments, fixed oil, bitter principles, resin, protein, cellulose, etc. The yellow pigmented fi-action contains curcuminoids viz. Curcumin(l,7,-Bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione). Curcumin is used in this composition not only for its therapeutic values but also for its colour. The colour of the produa helps in identifying the area of the infection. The novel anti-maggot and topical care composition comprises<br>
a)	Distillates oi Eucalyptus	-	10 to 20% w/w<br>
b)	Distillates of Cedrus	-	8 to 15% w/w<br>
c)	Distillates of P/WttJ	-	13 to 23% w/w<br>
d)	Emulsifier	-	1 to 5% w/w<br>
e)	Extract of Cwrcwwa	-	0.5 to 1.0% w/w<br>
f)	Solvent	-	15 to 25% w/w g)Excipient	-	12 to 18% w/w h) Emulsifier	.  ,              -	1 to 5% w/w<br>
i) The balance being the base<br>
According to the present invention, a process for the manufacture of herbal anti-maggot and topical care composition comprises.<br>
Step (1): making a mixture of distillates of Eucalyptus 10-20%, distillates of Cedrus 8-15%,<br>
distillates of pine 13-23% in an emulsifier 1-5% as herein descibed,	â€¢.<br>
Step (2): taking the extracts of Curcuma 0.5-1% and mixing it in a mixture of solvent 15-25% as herein described and an excipient 15-22% as herein described and emulsifier 1-5% as herein described.<br><br>
. Step (3): mixing the composition of step 1 with the composition of step 2 in a closed container at atmospheric pressure, at room temperature and stirring the said composition in the said container for a period till a homogenous composition is obtained,<br>
Step 4; mixing the said homogenous composition with a base as here in described and filling the final composition in a container.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The present invention comprises by:<br>
a), taking the distillates of Eucalyptus in the ratio of 12 % w/w<br>
b). taking the distillates ofCedrus in the ratio of 10% w/w.<br>
c). taking the distillates ofPifius in the ratio of 20%w/w.<br>
d). taking the extracts of Curcuma in the ratio of 0.6 % w/w.<br>
The above said distillates and extract (a+b+c+d) are mixed thoroughly and then mix them with a<br>
suitable solubiliser, emulsifier and excipients.<br>
(a), (b), and (c) distillates are mixed thoroughly with a solubiliser(Isopropyl alcohol taken in the range of 15% w/w) and emulsifier(Tween 20 taken in the range of 3%w/w) to get an uniform liquid called emulsified mixture. Then the extract of Curcuma (which has got the natural colour) is added to an amount of solubiliser and excipient is added and mixed thoroughly. Then this colour mixture is added to the emulsified mixture to get an active mix (AM). The balance being the LPG propellant base .<br>
The said active mix is filled in metal cans by using L.P.G as the propellant to get the final product in the form of spray.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The present invention comprises by:<br>
a)	taking the distillates of Eucalyptus in the ratio of 18 % w/w<br>
b)	taking distillates of Cei/rM5 in the ratio of 15% w/w.<br>
c)	taking the distillates of Pinus in the ratio of 15 % w/w<br>
d)	taking the extract of Curcuma in the ratio of 0.7 % w/w<br>
The above said distillates and extract (a+b+c+d) are mixed in the following ratio with a suitable solubiliser, emulsifier and excipients.<br><br>
(a), (b), and (c) distillates are mixed thoroughly with a solubiliser (Iso propyl alcohol taken in the range of 16 % w/w ) and emulsifier ( Tween 20 taken in the range of 7 % w/w) to get an uniform liquid called emulsified mixture. Then the extract of Curcuma (which has got the natural colour) is added to an amount of solubiliser and excipient is added and mixed thoroughly. Then this colour mixture is added to the emulsified mixture to get an active mix (AM). The balance being the LPG propellant base .<br>
This active mix is filled in metal cans by using L.P.G. as the propellant to get the final product in the form of spray.<br>
The present invention is a very potent anti-maggot and topical care composition, which removes the maggots and enhances the wound healing activity and restores the normal skin condition. Its mode of action is as follows:<br>
1.	It penetrates deeply and spreads easily into the lesions and thereby has faster artion.<br>
2.	It effectively kills the maggots and prevents further re-infestation because of its anti-maggot activity.<br>
3.	It is effective in treating wide spread lesion of dermatomycosis and mange due to its potent anti-bactericidal, anti-fungal properties,<br>
4.	It accelerates the wound healing activity by enhancing the regeneration of the normal tissues.<br>
5.	It imports washable stain to identify the area of application and also to ensure complete covering of the wound with the spars.<br><br><br>
