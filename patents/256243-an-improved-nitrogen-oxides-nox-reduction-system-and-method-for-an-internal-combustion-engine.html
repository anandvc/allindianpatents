OPTIMIZED NOx REDUCTION SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more particularly to an optimized NOx reduction exhaust system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Internal combustion engines generate drive torque by<br>
combusting an air and fuel mixture within cylinders. Exhaust that is generated<br>
via the combustion process is exhausted from the cylinders and is treated in<br>
an after-treatment system. During the combustion process, fuel is oxidized<br>
and hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) combine with air. Various chemical<br>
compounds are formed including carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), carbon<br>
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur<br>
oxides (SOx), and other compounds.<br>
[0003] The after-treatment systems traditionally include a catalytic<br>
converter that reduces exhaust emissions by chemically converting the<br>
exhaust gas into carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N), and water (H2O). In<br>
some cases, a lean NOx catalyst is implemented. Lean NOx technology, also<br>
known as HC selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has various formulations<br>
(e.g., platinum/alumina, copper and substituted zeolite. Platinum on alumina<br>
(Pt/AI2O3) functions at low temperatures, has higher peak conversion of<br>
approximately 40% at 225°C, but has a very narrow temperature window of<br>
operation (e.g., between 180 - 280°C). As a result, this formulation is not very<br>
useful by itself. Another disadvantage of platinum catalysts has been their<br>
SOx oxidation activity and it's susceptibility to deactivation by sulfur.<br>
[0004] NOx absorbers have also been developed based on acid-<br>
base wash-coat chemistry. The NOX is absorbed and is stored in the NOx<br>
absorber catalyst wash-coat during lean operating conditions (i.e., higher than<br>
stoichiometric air to fuel ratio). The NOx is released and is catalytically<br>
converted  to  nitrogen  during  rich  operating  conditions  (i.e.,  lower than<br><br>
2<br>
stoichiometric air to fuel ratio). Barium-based NOx absorbers have high<br>
conversion efficiency but are only active at increased temperatures (e.g.,<br>
greater than approximately 250°C). Also, NOx absorbers require periodic<br>
desulfation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Accordingly, the present invention provides an exhaust after-<br>
treatment system that overcomes the deficiencies of the above-described<br>
after-treatment technologies. The exhaust after-treatment system includes a<br>
lean NOx catalyst having an exhaust stream from said internal combustion<br>
engine flowing therethrough. A NOx absorber catalyst is downstream of the<br>
lean NOx catalyst. The NOx absorber is selectively regenerated to increase<br>
the NOx reduction efficiency of the exhaust after-treatment system.<br>
[0006] In another feature, the NOx absorber catalyst is regenerated<br>
when the NOx reduction demand is greater than a high threshold.<br>
[0007] In another feature, the lean NOx catalyst alone reduces a<br>
NOx content of the exhaust stream when a NOx reduction demand is less<br>
than a low threshold.<br>
[0008] In still other features, hydrocarbon (HC) is introduced into the<br>
exhaust stream when a NOx reduction demand is greater than a first<br>
threshold and is less than a second threshold. The HC is introduced via at<br>
least one of spark advance, post-combustion in-cylinder fuel injection and in-<br>
exhaust injection downstream of the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0009] In yet another feature, the exhaust after-treatment system<br>
further includes a hydrocarbon (HC) dosing unit disposed upstream of one of<br>
the lean NOx catalyst and the NOx absorber catalyst.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
3<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011] The present invention will become more fully understood<br>
from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0012] Figure 1 is a functional block diagram of an engine system<br>
including an optimized NOx reduction exhaust system in accordance with the<br>
present invention; and<br>
[0013] Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary steps executed<br>
using an optimized NOx reduction control of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit,<br>
and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0015] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
internal combustion engine 12 and an optimized NOx exhaust system 14 in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The engine 12 generates drive torque<br>
that is used to propel a vehicle, within which the engine system 10 is<br>
implemented, and/or drive accessory loads including, but not limited to, an<br>
alternator and a fluid pump (not shown). Air is drawn into an intake manifold<br>
16 through a throttle 18. The air is distributed to cylinders (not shown) of the<br>
engine 12 and is mixed with fuel to form a combustion mixture. The<br>
combustion mixture is ignited within the cylinder to reciprocally drive a piston<br>
(not shown). The combustion processes generates exhaust gas that exits the<br>
engine 12 through an exhaust manifold 20 and that is treated in the optimized<br>
NOx exhaust system 14.<br>
[0016] A control module 22 regulates operation of the engine<br>
system 10 based on various engine system operating conditions. A manifold<br>
absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 24 is responsive to the vacuum pressure<br><br>
4<br>
within the intake manifold 16 and generates a MAP signal based thereon. An<br>
engine RPM sensor 26 is responsive to an engine RPM and generates a<br>
signal based thereon. An exhaust temperature sensor 28 is disposed<br>
downstream of the exhaust manifold 20 and is responsive to the exhaust<br>
temperature (TEXH) and generates a signal based thereon.<br>
[0017] The optimized NOx exhaust system 14 includes a lean NOx<br>
catalyst 30 disposed upstream of a NOx absorber catalyst 32. An HC dosing<br>
unit 34 is disposed upstream of the lean NOx catalyst 30. The HC dosing unit<br>
34 selectively injects HCs into the exhaust stream, which is used for lean NOx<br>
catalyst 30 and NOx absorber catalyst 32 regeneration and desulfation. It is<br>
also anticipated that post-combustion fuel injection can be implemented to<br>
increase the HC content of the exhaust stream, whereby fuel is injected into<br>
the cylinder to be exhausted from the cylinder with the exhaust. Further,<br>
advanced combustion (i.e., HCCI) includes relatively higher engine out HC<br>
levels. This increased HC level is effectively utilized to reduce NOx over the<br>
lean NOx catalyst 30 while oxidizing the remaining HCs to release thermal<br>
energy.<br>
[0018] The combination of the lean NOx catalyst 30 and the NOx<br>
absorber catalyst 32 overcomes the shortcomings of the individual<br>
components. The so-configured optimized NOx exhaust system 14 enables<br>
the lean NOx catalyst 30 and the NOx absorber catalyst 32 to each be half the<br>
size if each were to be used individually. Because 75% of the NOx reduction<br>
occurs in the first half of the catalyst, for both the lean NOx catalyst 30 and<br>
the NOx absorber catalyst 32, reducing the size of each by half only reduces<br>
the NOx conversion efficiency by 25%.<br>
[0019] Both active and passive lean approaches can be<br>
implemented based on the NOx conversion efficiency requirements and<br>
engine out HCs. During the active approach, HC dosing in the exhaust and/or<br>
in the cylinder (i.e., post combustion fuel injection) is enabled. Further, the<br>
optimized NOx exhaust system enables tunable NOx conversion efficiency.<br>
For example, if only 25 - 30% reduction is required under certain operating<br>
conditions, only the lean NOx catalyst 30 is used, while the NOx absorber<br>
catalyst 32 stays inactive.   If higher efficiency is desired, the NOx absorber<br><br>
5<br>
catalyst 32 is periodically regenerated to store and reduce NOx to nitrogen, as<br>
well. As a result, fuel consumption is reduced. Further, the NOx absorber<br>
catalyst also acts as a clean-up catalyst for N2O if so required.<br>
[0020] During normal operation, if the engine out HC content is high<br>
and NOx reduction demand is low, no active control is required. The<br>
optimized NOx exhaust system 14 performs the required NOx reduction. If<br>
the NOx reduction demand increases, the HC content is increased to<br>
correspondingly increase the carbon to NOx ratio, thereby increasing the lean<br>
NOx reduction efficiency. If further NOx reduction is desired, the NOx<br>
absorber catalyst 32 can be periodically regenerated to store and convert<br>
NOx to N2 In this manner, a wide range of NOx conversion is achieved,<br>
which would otherwise not be possible with the lean NOx catalyst 30 or the<br>
NOx absorber catalyst 32 alone. Also, fuel consumption can be reduced<br>
because the HC rich exhaust for the NOx absorber catalyst regeneration is<br>
not required all of the time. Further, because the NOx absorber catalyst 32 is<br>
not used all of the time, its life is prolonged.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
optimized NOx exhaust control will be described in detail. In step 200, control<br>
determines whether the NOx reduction demand is less than a high threshold<br>
(THRHI) (e.g., 75%). If the NOx reduction demand is not less than THRHI,<br>
control regenerates the NOx absorber in step 202 and control ends. In this<br>
manner, both the NOx absorber catalyst 32 and the lean NOx catalyst 30 are<br>
implemented to achieve the higher conversion efficiency. If the NOx reduction<br>
demand is not less than THRHI, control continues in step 204.<br>
[0022] In step 204, control determines whether the NOx reduction<br>
demand is less than a low threshold (THRLo) (e.g., 30%). If the NOx<br>
reduction demand is not less than THRLO control increases the HC content of<br>
the exhaust in step 206 and control ends. In this manner, the conversion<br>
efficiency can be increased without regenerating the NOX absorber catalyst<br>
32. If the NOx reduction demand is not less than THRLO, control uses the<br>
lean NOx catalyst only in step 208 and control ends.<br><br>
6<br>
[0023] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification and the following claims.<br><br>
