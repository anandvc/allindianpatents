DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a field-effect, single molecule device having an induced foreyard biased p-n junction is capable of electrically induced optical emission. The emission can be from a single 1-d molecule, for example, a carbon nanotube or a boron-nitride nanotube, offering high scaling for electrically pumped optical emission devices.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 1 A. a device comprises a gate electrode 101, for example, a Silicon substrate. The gate electrode can be formed within the substrate or the gate electrode can be the substrate as shown in Fig. 1B. The device further comprises a gate oxide 102, such as a Silicon oxide layer or an Aluminum oxide layer, upon which a carbon nanotube 103 can be deposited. The carbon nanorabe 103 is witling an effective range of the gate electrode 101. such that the gate electrode can electrically stimulate the carbon nanotube 103 to produce an optical emission, for example, 100 nm. The carbon nanorube 103 can be, for example, a single-wall carbon nanotube having a chirality imparting a semiconducting characteristic. More than carbon nanotube can also be implemented. A source 104'and a drain 105 are formed at opposite ends of the carbon nanotube 103. A cap 106 such as a Silicon oxide can be deposited over the device.<br>
A carbon nanotube molecule can be single-walled or multi-walled. A multi-wall nanotube has a series of concentric nanotube cylinders. Both single-wall and multi-wall nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconductor depending on chirality (i.e., conformational geometry). Metallic nanotubes can carry large current densities with constant resistivity. Semiconducting nanotubes can be electrically switched on and off as field-effect transistors (FETs). The two types may be covalently joined (sharing electrons).<br>
Optical emission can be achieved from a carbon nanotube based molecular system through a forward biased p-n junction in which holes and electrons are injected across the space charge region. Recombination of excess electrons and holes in the space charge region can result in emission of photons, as in conventional direct bandgap semiconductor light emitting diodes. According to an embodiment of the present invention, however, the p and n<br><br>
regions are opposite ends of a single molecule, as contrasted to previous work involving polymeric or organic films and crystals.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, p and n regions can be created in a single molecule by selecting doping. For example, an intrinsically p type carbon macabre molecule 103 can be placed between source 104 and drain 105 electrodes. One end of the molecule is masked 201 using lithographic techniques, including for example, electron-beam lithography. The exposed end can then be doped. The exposed end of the intrinsically p-type molecule is doped to create an n-type region in the exposed area, e.g., by potassium doping. Thus, a p-n junction is created within the molecule that is then forward biased to create recombination radiation.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a nanotube based light emitting device can be a two-terminal p-n device or a three-terminal device. Referring to Fig. 2, the two-terminal p-n device comprising a source 104 and a drain 105 can be formed, wherein the. nanotube 103 is chemically doped. The two-terminal device does not comprise a gate, and thus, a chemically doped ascribe can be implemented to produce a p-n junction. To generate light, a bias voltage can be applied across the molecule 103, wherein a negative terminal is coupled to the n-t&gt;pe end of the molecule and a positive terminal is coupled to the p-type end of the molecule. The tire-terminal device comprises a source 104, a drain 105 and a gate 101, and the nanotube 103 can be chemically undoes, or chemically doped to augment field doping.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a single molecule 300 demonstrating ambipolar behavior is placed between drain 301 and source 302 electrodes in a field effect structure. The structure is then biased with the value of the gate voltage between the drain 301 and source 302 voltages. The gate field allows hole injection at one end of the nanotube and thus behaves as p-doped, and<br><br>
alternatively allows electron injection at another end of-the nanotube and thus behaves as rib-doped: Because of the opposite sign of the gate field a: ends of the molecule, one side of the molecule is p doped (h+) and the other side of the molecule is n doped (e-). Since the p duped region is on the side which has the higher voltage, the p-r. junction created in the molecule is forward biased. In this manner, a forward biased p-n junction is created in a single molecule allowing for recombination radiation (hv) to be created b;.' the current. The recombination radiation occurs along the nar.onibe body in the region of the p and n regions as shown in Fig.<br>
J.<br>
A prototype light eraining device has been constructed using a carbon nanotube. This example uses the first embodiment described above. The prototype device comprises a single carbon nanotube in a field effect structure. (See for example Figs. lA-B) This device . demonstrated ambipolar electrical conductivity.<br>
The voltages at the terminal of the device can be scaled with the thickness of the oxide. With a source voltage near 0 (for example, +/- '/: volt), the drain voltage is two times the gate voltage. For example, optical emission has been observed from the device by grounding the source, fixing the gate at +5 volts, and placing a +10 volt bias on the drain for a gate thickness of 100 nm. A charge density can be between 10^ Amps/cm^ and iC Amps/cm^, however this can vary with device parameters and geometry. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, in light of the present disclosures, that an operation voltage of the device can depend en device parameters and geometry. For example, a thinner gate oxide implies lower gate voltage operation. Near the source, the nanotube is n-doped because of the field effect doping.'Whh the opposite field on the nanotube near the drain, the marimba is p-doped in this region. In Fig. 4, the drain current is plotted as a function of drain voltage<br><br>
when sweeping from 0 to +10 volts with the gate voltage at +5 volts and the source grounded.<br>
Optical emission is observed from the device when operated in the forward-biased junction mode. The emission is in the infrared, as expected from, the small bandgap of the carbon nanotube. Since the bandgap of semiconductor nanotube scale as l/d, where d is the diameter of the tube, the emission of the device can be adjusted within a range from the infrared to the visible light.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, a method for generating light comprises	providing a field<br>
effect transistor comprising a source, a drain, a gate 2nd a carbon nanotube channel having a diameter adapted to generate light of a desired wavelength 501.-The gate can be biased with a voltage of about plus 5 volts 502, whereas the carbon nanotube channel can be forward-biased by applying a voltage of about plus 10 volts to the drain 503. The recombining of an electron and a hole generates light of the desired wavelength 504. Nanotubes can be used to generate light a portion of a spectrum including infrared and visible light according to the diameter of the nanotube.<br>
An advantage of this device is to allow electrically induced optical emission to be observed from a single molecule. Moreover, the carrier injection into this molecular device is highly efficient because the Schottky barrier is thin due to the one-dimensional electrostatic effects in nanotubes. e.g., tunneling rates at the contacts is high even for contacts with Fermi-level placed at mid-gap. The properties of the nanotube Scotty barriers in this one-dimensional system does not limit much the current and high injection rate is obtained, which favors higher efficiency for the emission. Therefore, this contact scheme does not need<br><br>
a specially designed contact with asymmetrical injection as it is usually the case in photon sources.'<br>
Having described prefeiTcd embodiments of a ivtolecuiar scale device capable of electrically induced optical emission, it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes ma;, be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
