The present invention relates  to compounds of formula I  and their pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  and  esters  thereof,  that  inhibit matrix   metalloproteases,   particularly  interstitial   collagenases,   and   are therefore  useful in the  treatment of mammals  having disease  states alleviated  by  the inhibition of such  matrix  metalloproteases.<br><br>
Matrix metalloproteases  ("MMPs") are  a family of proteases (enzymes)  involved  in  the degradation  and remodeling  of connective tissues.  Members  of this family  of endopeptidase  enzymes  are present in various cell types that reside in or are associated with connective tissue,  such as fibroblasts,  monocytes, macrophages,  endothelial  cells, and invasive or metastatic tumor cells, MMP expression is stimulated by growth factors and cytokines in the local tissue environment, where  these  enzymes  act to  specifically degrade protein components of the extracellular matrix,  such  as collagen, proteoglycans  (protein core),  fibronectin  and  laminin.  These  ubiquitous  extracellular  matrix components  are present in the linings of joints, interstitial connective tissues,  basement membranes,  and  cartilage.   Excessive  degradation  of extracellular matrix by MMPs is implicated in the pathogenesis of many   diseases,   including  rheumatoid   arthritis,   osteoarthritis,   multiple sclerosis,   chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,   cerebral hemorrhaging   associated   with   stroke,   periodontal   disease,   aberrant angiogenesis,   tumor invasion  and  metastasis,  corneal  ulceration,   and in complications of diabetes. MMP inhibition is, therefore, recognized as  a good  target for therapeutic intervention.<br>
The MMPs share a number of properties, including zinc and calcium dependence,  secretion as zymogens, and 40-50% amino acid sequence homology. The MMP family currently consists of at least eleven  enzymes,  and  includes collagenases,  stromelysins,  gelatinases, matrilysin,   metalloelastase,   and  membrane-type  MMP,   as  discussed  in greater  detail   below.<br><br>
Interstitial  collagenases  catalyze  the  initial  and  rate-limiting cleavage of native collagen types I, 11, and III. Collagen, the major structural protein of mammals, is an essential component of the matrix of many tissues, for example, cartilage, bone, tendon and skin. Interstitial   collagenases   are  very   specific   matrix  metalloproteases which cleave these collagens to give two fragments which spontaneously   denature   at  physiological   temperatures   and   therefore become susceptible to cleavage by less specific enzymes. Cleavage by the collagenases results in the loss of structural integrity of the target tissue,   essentially  an  irreversible  process.   There  are  currently  three known  human  collagenases.  The  first is  human  fibroblast-type collagenase (HFC, MMP-1, or collagenase-1) that is produced by a wide variety  of cells including fibroblasts  and macrophages.  The second is human neutrophil-type collagenase (HNC, MMP-8,  or collagenase-2)  that has  so far only been demonstrated to  be  produced by neutrophils. The most recently discovered member of this  group of MMPs is human collagenase-3  (MMP-13) which was originally found in breast carcinomas, but has since shown to be produced by chondrocytes. The only collagenase known to exist in rodents is the homolog  of human collagenase-3.<br>
The gelatinases include two distinct, but highly related, enzymes: a 72-kD enzyme (gelatinase A, HFG, MMP-2) secreted by fibroblasts and a wide variety of other cell types, and a 92-kD enzyme (gelatinase B, HNG, MMP-9) released by mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils,  corneal  epithelial  cells,  tumor  cells,  cytotrophoblasts  and keratinocytes.  These  gelatinases  have been  shown  to  degrade  gelatins (denatured  collagens),   collagen  types  IV   (basement  membrane)   and V,  fibronectin and insoluble elastin.<br>
Stromelysins  1  and 2 have been shown to cleave a broad range of matrix   substrates,  including  laminin,  fibronectin,  proteoglycans,   and collagen types  IV and IX in their non-helical domains.<br><br>
Matrilysin (MMP-7, PUMP-1) has been shown to degrade a wide range  of matrix  substrates  including  proteoglycans,   gelatins, fibronectin,  elastin,  and laminin.  Its expression has been documented in  mononuclear phagocytes,  rat  uterine  explants  and  sporadically in tumors.   Other less  characterized  MMPs  include macrophage metalloelastase  (MME,  MMP-12), membrane type MMP (MMP-14), and   stromelysin-3   (MMP-11).<br>
Inhibitors  of MMPs  provide  useful  treatments  for diseases associated  with  the  excessive degradation  of extracellular matrix,  such as   arthritic   diseases   (rheumatoid   arthritis   and  osteoarthritis),   multiple sclerosis,  bone resorptive diseases  (such  as osteoporosis), the enhanced  collagen  destruction  associated  with  diabetes,  chronic obstructive   pulmonary   disease,   cerebral   hemorrhaging   associated with  stroke,  periodontal disease,  corneal or gastric  ulceration, ulceration  of the  skin,  tumor invasion  and metastasis,  and  aberrant angiogenesis.  The involvement of individual collagenases in the degradation  of tissue  coUagens  probably  depends  markedly  on  the tissue.  The  tissue  distribution of human collagenases  suggests  that collagenase-3  is the major participant in the degradation of the collagen matrix of cartilage, while collagenase-1  is more likely to be involved in tissue remodeling of skin and other soft tissues. Thus, inhibitors   selective  for  collagenase-3  over  collagenase-1   are  preferred for treatment of diseases associated with cartilage erosion, such as arthritis,   etc.<br>
Inhibitors of MMP also are known to substantially inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from cells, and which therefore may be used in the treatment of conditions mediated by TNF.    Such uses include,  but are not limited to, the treatment of inflammation, fever,   cardiovascular  effects,  hemorrhage,   coagulation  and  acute phase response, cachexia and anorexia,  acute infections,  shock states, restinosis,   aneurysmal  disease,   graft versus  host  reactions  and autoimmune   disease.<br><br>
In addition to these effects on the release of TNF from cells, MMP inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit the release of other biologically active molecules from cells, including soluble receptors (CD30 and receptors for TNF (p55 and p75), IL-6, IL-1 and TSH), adhesion molecules  (e.g., L-selection, ICAM-1, fibronectin) and other growth factors and cytokines, including Fas ligand, TGF-a, EGF, HB-EGF, SCF and M-CSF. Inhibition of the release or shedding of such proteins may be of benefit in a number of disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis,  multiple sclerosis,  vascular disease, Type II diabetes,  HIV, cachexia,  psoriasis,  allergy,  hepatitis,  inflammatory  bowel disease,  and cancer.<br>
Since  non-specific  inhibition  of the  shedding enzymes  (sheddases) may have opposite pharmacological effects,  selectivity will be  a particular advantage,  e,g., the inhibition of TNF release without the concurrent inhibition of TNF receptor release.<br>
The design and uses of MMP inhibitors is described, for example, in J.  Enzyme Inhibition, 2, 1-22 (1987); Drug News  &amp; Prospectives, 3(8),  453-458  (1990); Arthritis   and   Rheumatism, 36(2),   181-189 (1993); Arthritis   and  Rheumatism, 34(9),   1073-1075   (1991); Seminars  in  Arthritis  and Rheumatism, 19(4),   Supplement   1 (February),   16-20  (1990);  Drugs of the Future, 15(5),   495-508 (1990); and J,  Enzyme Inhibition,!,  1-22 (1987).

Unless specified to the contrary,  the  solvents used in the reactions of the present invention are   inert  solvents.<br>
The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric  centers;  such compounds  can therefore be produced  as<br><br>
mixtures of stereoisomers or as individual (R)- or (S)-   stereoisomers. The individual enantioraers may  be obtained by resolving  a racemic or  non-racemic  mixture of an  intermediate  at  some  appropriate  stage of the synthesis. It is understood that the individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers  as well as racemic mixtures and other mixtures  of stereoisomers  are  encompassed  within  the  scope  of the  present invention.<br>
The use of the symbol "(R)" or "(5)" preceding a substituent designates   the  absolute   stereochemistry  of that   substituent  according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules [see Cahn et al., Angew.   Chem.  Inter, Edit,, 5, 385 (1966), errata p. 511; Cahn et al., Angew,   Chem,, 78, 413 (1966); Cahn and Ingold, 7. Chem. Soc, (London), 612 (1951); Cahn et al., Experientia, 12, 81 (1956); Cahn J., Chem,  Educ, 41,  116 (1964)]. Because of the interrelation of the designated substituent with the other substituents in a compound having a or 6 prefixes, the designation of the  absolute configuration of one  substituent fixes the absolute configuration of all substituents in the compound and thus the absolute configuration of the compound as a whole.<br>
"Stereoisomers"  are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are  arranged  in  space.<br>
"Enantiomers"  are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable  mirror  images  of each  other.  Enantiomers  rotate the plane of polarized light in opposite directions. The enantiomer that rotates the plane to the left is called the levo isomer, and is designated (-). The enantiomer that rotates  the plane to the right is called the dextro isomer, and is designated (+).<br>
"Diastereoisomers"  are  stereoisomers  which  are  not mirror-images  of each  other.<br>
"Racemic mixture" means a mixture containing equal parts of individual  enantiomers.   "Non-racemic  mixture"  is  a  mixture<br><br>
containing  unequal  parts   of individual  enantiomers.<br>
"Mammal" includes humans and all domestic and wild animals, ncluding, without limitation, cattle, horses, swine, sheep, goats, dogs, :ats, and the like.<br>
"Treating"  or "treatment"  as used herein cover the treatment of a lisease-state in a mammal,  particularly in a human,  and include;<br>
(i) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal,  in 3articular,  when  such  mammal is  predisposed  to  the  disease-state  but las not yet been diagnosed as having it;<br>
(ii) inhibiting the disease-state,  i.e.,  arresting its development;  or (iii) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the iisease-state.<br>
The  term   "therapeutically  effective  amount"  refers  to  that  amount of a compound of Formula I that is sufficient to effect treatment, as lefined above, when administered to a mammal in need of such reatment.   The  therapeutically  effective   amount  will   vary   depending on the subject and disease state being treated, the severity of the affliction  and  the manner of administration,  and may  be  determined coutinely by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Synthetic   Reaction   Parameters<br>
Unless  specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein take  place  at  atmospheric  pressure  within  a  temperature  range  from 5°C to 100°C (preferably from 10°C to 50°C; most preferably at "room" or "ambient"  temperature,  e.g., 20°C). Further, unless otherwise specified,  the reaction times and conditions are intended to be approximate,   e.g., taking place at about atmospheric pressure within a temperature range of about 5°C to about  100°C (preferably from about 10°C to about 50°C; most preferably about 20°C) over a period of about  1   to  about  10 hours (preferably about 5 hours).  Parameters given in the Examples are intended to be specific, not approximate.<br>
Amide couplings used to form the compounds of Formula I are generally  performed  by  the  carbodiimide  method  with  reagents   such<br><br>
as   1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide   or  N'-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-carbodiimide   hydrochloride   or   alternatively   1 -(3-dimethy 1-aminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide   hydrochloride   (EDCI),   in   the presence of  1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate  (HOBT)  in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide  (DMF)  or methylene   chloride (CH2CI2). Other methods of forming the amide or peptide bond<br>
include, but are not limited to, synthetic routes via an acid chloride, acyl azide, mixed anhydride or activated ester such as a p-nitrophenyl ester.  Typically,  solution phase  amide couplings  with or without   peptide   fragments   are   performed.<br>
The selection of amino protecting groups used in the preparation of compounds of Formula I is dictated in part by the particular amide coupling conditions, and in part by the components involved in the coupling.   Amino-protecting  groups  commonly  used  include  those which  are well-known  in the  art,  for example,  benzyloxycarbonyl (carbobenzyloxy)  (CBZ), p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl,   p-nitro-benzyloxycarbonyl,   N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), and the like. It is preferred to use either BOC or CBZ as the protecting group for the a-amino group because of the relative ease of removal by mild acids in the case of BOC, e.g., by trifluoroacetic acid (TEA) or hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate; or removal by catalytic hydrogenation in the case of CBZ<br>

The reaction is carried out at a temperature range from  about O°C to  40°C,  preferably  at about room  temperature.

The  present invention also relates  to  a pharmaceutical composition  comprising  a  pharmaceutically  acceptable  non-toxic excipient and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula  I.<br><br>
Administration of the compounds of Formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out via any of the accepted modes  of administration or agents  for serving  similar utilities. Thus, administration can be, for example,  orally, nasally, parenterally,  topically, transdermally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as for example,  tablets,  suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages* The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of Formula I as the/an active agent,  and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents,  pharmaceutical  agents,  carriers,  adjuvants,   etc.<br>
Generally,  depending on  the intended  mode  of administration,  the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions will contain about  1%  to about 99% by weight of a compound(s) of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and 99% to  1% by weight of a  suitable pharmaceutical excipient.  Preferably,  the  composition  will be about 5% to 75% by weight of a compound(s) of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt  thereof,  with  the rest being  suitable pharmaceutical   excipients.<br>
The preferred route of administration is oral,  using a convenient daily dosage regimen which can be adjusted according to the degree of severity of the disease-state to be treated. For such oral administration,   a  pharmaceutically   acceptable   composition   containing a compound(s) of Formula I,  or a pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt thereof, is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients,  such  as for example, pharmaceutical  grades  of mannitol,  lactose,  starch,  pregelatinized  starch,  magnesium   stearate, sodium  saccharine,  talcum,  cellulose ether  derivatives,  glucose, gelatin, sucrose, citrate, propyl gallate, and the like. Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules.<br><br>
powders,   sustained release  formulations,   and  the  like.<br>
Preferably such compositions will take the form of capsule, caplet or tablet and therefore will also contain a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, and the like; a disintegrant, such as croscarmellose  sodium  or derivatives thereof;  a lubricant such  as magnesium stearate and the like; and a binder such as a starch,  gum acacia,  polyvinylpyrrolidone,  gelatin,  cellulose  ether  derivatives,  and the like.<br>
The compounds of Formula I, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, may also be formulated into a suppository using, for example, about 0.5% to about 50% active ingredient disposed in a carrier that slowly dissolves within the body, e.g.,   polyoxyethylene glycols and polyethylene glycols (PEG), e.g., PEG 1000 (96%) and PEG 4000 (4%).<br>
Liquid  pharmaceutically  administrable  compositions  can,   for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc., a compound(s) of Formula I (about 0.5% to about 20%), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,  and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension.<br>
If desired,  a pharmaceutical  composition of the invention  may also contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, antioxidants, and the like, such as, for example, citric acid, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanol-amine  oleate,   butylated hydroxytoluene,   etc.<br>
Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's  Pharmaceutical  Sciences,  18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania (1990). The composition to be administered  will,  in  any event,  contain  a  therapeutically effective<br><br>
amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically  acceptable salt thereof,  for treatment of a disease-state  alleviated by  the inhibition  of matrix metalloprotease  activity in accordance  with  the teachings  of this  invention.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or their pharmaceutically  acceptable salts,  are  administered  in  a therapeutically  effective  amount  which will vary depending upon a variety of factors including the activity of the  specific  compound employed,  the metabolic stability and length of action of the compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet,  mode  and time of administration,  rate  of excretion,  drug combination,   the  severity  of the  particular  disease-state,   and  the  host undergoing  therapy*  Generally,  a  therapeutically  effective  daily  dose IS from about 0,014 mg to about 14.3 mg/kg of body weight per day of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; preferably, from about 0.07 mg to about 5 mg/kg of body weight per day;  and most preferably, from about 0.14 mg to about L4 mg/kg of body weight per day. For example, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be from about 1 mg to about 1.0 gram per day of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably from about 5 mg to about 300 mg per day, and most preferably from about  10 mg to about  100 mg per day.<br><br>

The    2-[l-(4-phenoxyphenylthio)-cyclopent-l-yl]-acetic   acid obtained in Example 5 was dissolved in methylene chloride (8 ml) and treated   with   4-dimethylaminopyridine   (180  mg),   O-fferf-butyl)-hydroxylamine   hydrochloride   (360   mg),   triethylamine   (540 µL), pyridine (400 µL),   and    l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)'3-ethylcarbodi-imide hydrochloride (750 mg).  After  stirring  overnight the  reaction mixture  was  partitioned  between  ethyl  acetate  and  water,   the  organic layer  separated,   and  the  solvent  removed  under  reduced  pressure. Preparative TLC of the residue and elution with 2:1  hexane/ethyl acetate gave N-(tert-butoxy)-2-[l-(4-phenoxyphenylthio)-cyclopent-l-yl]-acetamide (270 mg) as a white foam, which can be used in the next  reaction   without   further  purification.<br>
9B. Preparation of lb where R3 and R4 are Hydrogen, R3 and R4 when taken together with the Carbon to which they  are attached are Tetrahydropyran.   and   R5   is   4-PhenQxyphenyl<br>

After  stirring for 3 hours  at room temperature,  0.5  M<br><br>
ydrochloric acid (200 ml) was added to the mixture, and the mixture xtracted with methylene chloride.  The  solvent was removed from he combined extracts under reduced pressure.  Silica gel hromatography of the residue and elution with 35%-80% ethyl Lcetate/hexane   gave   N-ferf-butoxy-2-[4-(4-phenoxyphenylthio)-etrahydropyran-4-yl]-acetamide (15.3  g) as an oil,  which can be used n the next reaction without further purification.<br>
9C, Preparation of lb where R3 and R4 are Hydrogen. R3 and R4 vhen taken together with the Carbon to which they are attached are V-BOC-Piperidine.  and R5   is  4-(4-Chlorophenoxy)phenyl<br>
4-Methylmorpholine   (2.60 ml,   23*68   mmol)   was   added   dropwise to   a  solution  of 2-{4-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenylthiomethyl]-N-BOC-piperidin-4-yl}-carboxylic acid obtained in Example 6 (2.83  g,  5.92 mmol),  0-(tert-butyl)hydroxylamine  hydrochloride   (2.23   g,   17.76 mmol),    and    l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride   (2.27   g,   11.84 mmol)  in  anhydrous   methylene   chloride (25 ml) cooled to O°C. After the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over  1  hour and stirred for an additional 12  hours,  the mixture was partitioned between diethyl ether/1   N aqueous hydrochloric acid (300 ml). The acid layer was back extracted using diethyl ether (2 x  100 ml), and the combined ether extracts  dried  over magnesium  sulfate  and  concentrated. Chromatography over silica gel, and eluting with 25% ethyl acetate/hexanes,   gave  N-(tert-butoxy)-2-{4-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenylthiomethyl]-iV-BOC-piperidin-4"yl) -carboxamide (2.88 g, 89%). 1HNMR (CDCl3) 5 L31 (s, 9H), 1.45 (s, 9H), 1.58 (mc, 2H), 2.10 (br d, J = 14.2 Hz, 2H), 3.13 (s, 2H), 3.19 (mc, 2H), 3.73 (mc, 2H), 6.93 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 6.95 (d, J ^ 8.9 Hz, 2H), 7.30 (d, J = 8,9 Hz, 2H), 7,38 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 8.15 (br s, 1H).<br>

Assays were performed in assay buffer (50 mM Tricine pH 7.5, 200 mM sodium chloride,  10 mM calcium chloride, 0.005% Brij-35) containing 2.5% methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) once the substrate and inhibitor were diluted into it.  Stock solutions of inhibitors were<br><br>
prepared in  100% DMSO. Stock solutions of the substrate were prepared in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 2 mM.<br>
The assay method was based on the hydrolysis of MCA-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-DPA-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Bachem, Inc.) at 37°C (Knight, C.G. et aL,<br>
FEBS, 296,  263-266 (1992)). The fluorescence changes were monitored with a Perkin-Elmer LS-SOB  fluorimeter using  an excitation wavelength of 328  nm and an emission wavelength of 393 nm. The substrate concentration used in the assays was 10 |j.mole.   The inhibitor was diluted into the assays from a solution in 100% DMSO, and controls substituted an equal volume of DMSO so that the final DMSO concentration from inhibitor and substrate dilutions in all assays was 2*5%. The inhibition results are expressed as the inhibitor concentration  that produced  50%  inhibition  (IC50) of the activity in<br>
the   control   (non-inhibited)   reaction.<br>

Small  cartilage explants  (3  mm diameter)  were prepared  from freshly sacrificed bovine knee joints and labeled with 35SO4. 35$_<br>
labelled glycosaminoglycans  (GAG's) and collagen fragments are released into the culture medium in response to the addition of rhIL-1-alpha,  which  induces  the  expression of chondrocyte  matrix metalloproteases  (MMP's),  including  stromelysin  and coUagenase.  The percent inhibition  of hydroxyproline and GAG's released was corrected  for  spontaneous release in the  absence  of rhlL-1-alpha.<br>
