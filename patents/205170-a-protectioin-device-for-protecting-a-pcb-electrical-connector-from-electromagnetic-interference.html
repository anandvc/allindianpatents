[See Section 10]<br>
"A     PROTECTION     DEVICE     FOR    PROTECTING    A     PCB ELECTRICAL<br>
CONNECTOR FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE"   	<br>
ALSTOM, A French company, of 25, avenue Kleber, 75116 Paris, France,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>
28-9-2001<br><br><br><br>
A PROTECTION DEVICE FOR PROTECTING A PCB ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE<br>
The present invention relates to a protection device for protecting an electrical connector from electromagnetic interference, the connector including a body made of a plastics material having a front face serving to co-operate with a removable plug and a connection side face touching a printed circuit board.<br>
The device of the invention may be used in particular for protecting from electromagnetic interference a connector of known type such as DIN Standard F48 or E48 connectors which are in common use for interconnecting printed circuits with control or power supply cables, e.g. in an installation having electronics cards carried by a rack module on board a motive power unit of a rail vehicle.<br>
In the prior art, in particular in compliance with Standard DIN 41612 / IEC 603-2 and using DIN F48 or E48 type connectors, it is known that it is possible to protect electronics cards from electromagnetic radiation by using removable plugs that are shielded by means of conductive cladding of the "Zamak" type.  Unfortunately, such a solution suffers from the drawback of significantly increasing the overall size of the plug, which makes it necessary to reduce the number of contacts available in the plug for cards at the same pitch.  In addition, such a shielded plug is much more costly to manufacture than a conventional plug made of plastic, and it is much heavier, which gives rise to additional constraints, in particular in terms of vibration behavior.  Another drawback with shielded plugs is that the magnetic protection disappears whenever the plug is removed, even though, in some uses, a plug is necessary plugged in only occasionally, in particular for maintenance or testing of certain electronics cards. Such a solution makes it necessary to leave a shielded plug connected permanently in order to guarantee that the<br><br><br>
electronics card is magnetically protected, which gives rise to increased equipment cost.<br>
An object of the present invention is thus to remedy the various above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
To this end, the invention provides a protection device for protecting an electrical connector for a printed circuit board from electromagnetic interference, the connector including a body made of a plastics material having a front face serving to co-operate with a removable plug and a connection side face touching the board of the printed circuit, the connector including a plurality of contacts, each of which has one end in the form of a spike that projects from the connection side face, the spikes being inserted through holes in the board for the purpose of electrically connecting the contacts to one or more conductor tracks of the printed circuit, said protection device being characterized, in that it comprises a first shielding element extending facing the side face of the connector that is opposite from the connection side face', and continuing facing the rear face of the connector so as. to come into contact with a grounding conductor track of the board of the printed circuit, and a second shielding element mounted on that face of the board of the printed circuit which is opposite from its face in contact with the connector, and extending facing said connection side face, the second shielding element being in contact with a conductor track connected to the grounding track of the printed circuit so as to be electrically connected to the first shielding element and so as to form a potential cage.<br>

the first shielding element is formed by a metal sheet co-operating with the top row of contacts, said metal sheet extending facing that side face of the connector which is opposite from the connection face, and having a curved-over end coming into contact with said top row of contacts;<br>

To facilitate understanding the drawings, only those elements which are necessary to understanding the invention are shown.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rack module 10 of the type described in the Applicant's Application FR 99 10 097, supporting a plurality of electronics cards 1 in an installation on board a rail vehicle.  The rack module 10 comprises a frame 20 provided with metal walls to which guide rails 21 are fixed.  The guide rails make it possible to insert the electronics cards 1 via the front face of the frame 20.  Each electronics card 1 comprises a printed circuit board 2 whose front edge is provided with a connector 3 and with a fascia element 4 surrounding the connector 3 so as to close off the front face of the frame 20.  The boards 2 of the printed circuits support electronics components (not shown) and their rear ends support second connectors (not shown) that connect automatically to link cables at the end of the insertion stroke whereby the electronics cards are inserted into the guide rails 21.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the fascia element 4 is provided with fixing screws 41 that hold the electronics card 1 stationary in the frame 20.  The fascia element 4 also has a front face provided with studs 42 serving to co-operate with guide orifices in a plug (not shown) so as to guide said plug as it is being inserted into the connector.  The fascia element 4 is preferably a "Zamak" casting so as to be electrically conductive, it being<br><br><br>
possible to improve its conductivity by means of surface treatment comprising nickel deposition.  In a variant embodiment, suitable for environments that are not very severe, the fascia element 4 may also be made of a molded plastics material and metal-plated with nickel.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 to 4, the connector 3 comprises a body made of a plastics material and in compliance with DIN 41612 / IEC 603-2 Standard of the F48 type, and having a front face provided with three mutually-parallel rows of sixteen connection pins 31. . The pins 31 are embedded in the body molding of the connector 3, and each of them has a rear portion with a bend in it and whose end is in the form of a spike 31 that projects from a connection side face 3c of the connector 3.  The connection side face 3c is provided with a setback for receiving the printed circuit board 2 on the connector 3, without increasing the overall width of the connector.<br>
The connector 3 bears via its connector face 3c against the board 2 of the printed circuit so that the spikes 31a penetrate through plated through holes in the printed circuit so that they project slightly from the other face of the printed circuit, and the spikes 31a are soldered to establish electrical contact between the pins 31 and conductor tracks (not shown) on the printed circuit.<br>
The fascia element 4 has a channel-section body that surrounds the three side faces of the connector 3 that do not bear against the printed circuit board 2, the front face of the fascia element 4 being mounted slightly set back from the front edge of the connector 3.<br>
The central portion 4a of the body of the fascia element 4 is parallel to the printed circuit board 2, and, on its outside face, it supports a first shielding element 6 constituted by a metal angle bracket 6a of which one branch 6a extends parallel to the printed circuit board, facing and in the vicinity of the side<br><br><br>
face 3a of the connector that is opposite from the connection side face 3c, and the other branch 6b extends along the rear face 3b of the connector 3, perpendicularly to and to the vicinity of the printed circuit-board 2.  The branch 6a parallel to the printed circuit extends from the front edge of the fascia element 4 to the rear edge of the connector 3, and is directly in contact with the fascia element 4 so that electrical continuity exists between the angle bracket 6 and the fascia, element 4.  The branch 6b extending along the rear face 3b of the connector 3 is uninterrupted, and the edge of the branch 6b adjacent to the board 2 is provided with spikes 61 which are inserted through the plated through holes in the printed circuit board that are connected to a grounding conductor track.  The branch 6a parallel to the printed circuit is substantially uninterrupted and it is provided with resilient tongues 9 which are advantageously formed by cutting out and folding, and which project from one side of the fascia element 4 to establish contact with a shielding element of.an adjoining card disposed in the rack module 10, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the face of the printed circuit board that is opposite from its  face in contact with the connector 3 is covered with a second shielding element 7 constituted by metal sheet extending facing the connection side face 3c of the connector.  The metal sheet 7 is in contact with a conductor track (not shown) coming up to the surface of the integrated circuit board at this point, and connected to the grounding conductor track to which the spikes 61 of the first shielding sheet 6 are connected, thereby providing electrical conductivity between the first shielding element 6 and the second shielding element 7.<br>
The metal sheet 7 forming the second shielding element has a fitted rear shape that goes round the zones from which the spikes 31a of the pins 31 project, and has<br><br><br>
a step that matches the setback formed by the junction where the front edge of the board 2 meets the connector 3, so as to cover the front portion of the connection side face 3c of the connector 3 up to the front face of the fascia element 4.<br>
The shielding metal sheet 7 is held in abutment against the board 2 of the printed circuit by means of two fixing screws 11 screwed to the fascia element 4 and sandwiching the connector 3, the printed circuit board 2, and the metal sheet 7.<br>
The resulting protection device forms a potential cage surrounding the connection face, the opposite face, and the rear face of the connector, thereby protecting the electronic components carried by the printed circuit board from electromagnetic interference passing through the front face of the connector.  In addition, since the fascia element surrounding the front face of the connector is made of a conductive material and electrically connected to the shielding elements of the connector, the set of electronics cards placed touching one another forms a potential barrier limiting the amount of electromagnetic interference that can enter via the front face of the rack module, thereby protecting all of the electromagnetic components carried by the electronics cards.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a variant embodiment of the protection device for protecting the electrical connector described with reference to Figures 1 to 4.  In this variant embodiment, the first shielding, element and the grounding conductor track of the printed circuit are implemented differently, while the other elements remain identical to what is described above.  As shown in Figure 5, the central portion 4a of the channel-section body of the fascia element (identical to the fascia element of Figures 1 to 4) supports a shielding metal sheet 8 that is substantially uninterrupted and that extends facing that side face 3a of the connector 3 which is opposite<br><br><br>
from the connection side face 3c.  The metal sheet 8 is provided with a curved-over end matching the shape of the rear edge of the fascia element 4 and provided with tabs 8a coming into abutment against the top row of the pins 31 of the connector 3, i.e. the row that is furthest from the board 2 of the printed circuit.  This top row of the pins 31 of the connector extends parallel to the board 2 from the front face of the connector 3 to the vicinity of the rear face of the connector 3, and then extends perpendicular to the board 2 of the printed circuit at the rear face of the connector 3 so that the ends of the pins 31 that form the spikes 31a penetrate through the plated through holes in the board 2 and come into contact with a grounding conductor track of the printed circuit.<br>
The shielding metal sheet 8 is further provided with resilient tongues 9 projecting from one side of the fascia element 4 so as to establish contact with a shielding element of an adjoining card disposed in the rack module, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
The printed circuit board supports a second shielding element 7 identical to the element described in Figures 1 to 4, and disposed in contact with a conductor track connected to the grounding conductor track to which the end spikes 31a of the top row of pins 31 are   . . connected.<br>
In this variant embodiment, the top row of pins is used to implement the first shielding element, in association with the metal sheet supported by the top portion of the fascia element.  The shielding of the rear face of the connector is then implemented by the mesh formed by the succession of pins extending perpendicularly to the printed circuit board and connected to the grounding circuit.  Such a variant embodiment is possible when the top row of pins can be made available for the shielding, i.e. when the number of pins necessary for transmitting information through the connector is much lower than the number of pins available<br><br><br>
on the connector.  Such a variant offers the advantage of being simple to implement by requiring few holes and few conductor tracks on the printed circuit board.  The higher the number of pins used for the shielding and the closer they are together, the higher the performance at high frequencies of the protection from electromagnetic interference that is procured by this variant embodiment. Naturally, it is possible, in other variant embodiments (not shown) of the protection device of the invention , to use fewer pins for the shielding so as to have more pins available for information transmission.<br>
Figures 7 to 10 show a second embodiment of the protection device of the invention, in which the connector 3 used on the front face of the electronics card 1 complies with Standard DIN E 48.<br>
Similarly to the connector of the first embodiment described above, the DIN E 48 Standard connector 3 has a body made of a plastics material and having a front face provided with three mutually-parallel rows of sixteen pins 31, only the spacing between the pins 31 being greater than the spacing between the pins in DIN F 48 Standard connectors.<br>
The connector 3 is touching the printed circuit board 2 via its connection side face 3c,. and the end spikes 31a of the pins 31 penetrate into plated through holes (not shown) and are soldered to provide electrical contact between the pins 31a and conductor tracks (not shown) on the printed circuit board 2.<br>
A fascia element 4 having a substantially rectangular body is mounted around the electronics card 1 constituted by the connector 3 and by the printed circuit board 2.  The body of the fascia element 4 has a fitted opening making it possible to put the fascia element 4 in place over the assembly comprising the connector 3 and the board 2, so that the front face of the fascia element 4 is substantially flush with the front edge of the connector.  The fascia element 4 is made by molding an<br><br><br>
electrically-conducive material, such as "Zamak", and it has a front face provided with two studs 42 serving to co-operate with guide orifices in a plug (not shown) to guide said plug as it is being inserted into the connector 3.  The front face of the fascia element 4 is also provided with two fixing screws 41 for holding the electronics card 1 stationary on the frame 20, and, in alignment with the printed circuit board 2, it is provided with a guide edging strip 43 projecting frontwards.<br>
The body of the fascia element 4 is provided with a top wall 4a adjacent to the side face 3a of the connector 3, and extending parallel to the printed circuit board 2 to co-operate with a metal angle bracket 12 mounted against the top wall 4a to constitute a first shielding element.  The angle bracket 12 has an uninterrupted branch 12a that extends parallel to the printed circuit board 2 over the rear portion of the fascia element while being held in contact with the bottom face of the top wall 4a by two screws so that electrical continuity exists between the angle bracket 12 and the fascia element 4.  The angle bracket 12. also includes an uninterrupted branch 12b that extends along the rear face 3b of the connector 3, perpendicularly to and to the vicinity of the printed circuit board 2, and having an edge adjacent to the printed circuit board 2 that is provided with spikes 12c which are inserted through plated through holes in the board 2 and are connected to a grounding conductor track.<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 10, the body of the fascia element 4 includes a bottom wall 4b which is in contact with the printed circuit board 2, and which extends facing the connection side face 3c of the connector 3 so as to constitute a second shielding element.  The bottom wall 4b, adjacent to the printed circuit board 2, has a fitted rear shape that goes round the zone from which the spikes 31a of the pins 31 project, and that covers the<br><br><br>
front portion of the printed circuit board 2 by coming into contact with a conductor track (not shown) which comes to the surface of the printed circuit board 2 and which is connected to the grounding conductor track to which the spikes 12c. of the shielding sheet 12 are connected.<br>
The printed circuit board 2 is held in contact with the bottom wall 4b by means of two fixing screws 11 screwed to the connector 3 while sandwiching the printed circuit board 2.  The outside face of the bottom wall 4b is provided with a groove that receives a metal strip provided with resilient tongues 19 projecting sideways from the side face of the fascia-element 4 so as to establish contact with a shielding element of an adjoining card, as shown in Figure 10.<br>
With the assembly formed by the fascia element assembled to the electronics card taking up a. limited amount of space laterally, such an embodiment makes it possible to provide excellent protection for the electronics components carried by the printed circuit board from electromagnetic interference passing through the front face of the connector.<br>
Figures 11 to 12 show a variant of the second embodiment of the protection device described with reference to Figures 7 to 10, in which the first shielding element and the grounding conductor track of the printed circuit are implemented differently, the other elements remaining identical to those described with reference to Figures 7 to 10  As shown in Figure 11, the body of the fascia element 4 (identical to the element described in the second embodiment) includes a top wall 4a co-operating with an uninterrupted metal sheet 13 mounted against the top wall 4a to constitute a first shielding element.  The metal sheet 13 extends parallel to the printed circuit board over the rear portion of the fascia element 4, and it is provided with a curved-over end having tabs 13a that come into abutment<br><br><br>
against the top row of pins 31 of the connector 3, i.e. the row furthest from the printed circuit board 2.  The top row of pins 31 extends parallel to the board from the front face of the connector 3 to the vicinity of the rear face of the connector 3, and then extends perpendicularly to the printed circuit board 2 at the rear face of the connector 3, so that the ends of the pins 31 that form spikes 31a penetrate into plated through holes in the printed circuit board 2 and are in contact with a grounding conductor track of the printed circuit.<br>
The metal sheet 13 is held in contact with the bottom face of the top wall 4a by two screws so that electrical continuity exists between the metal sheet 13 and the fascia element 4 which is made of an electrically-conductive material.<br>
The second shielding element 4b of this variant embodiment is entirely identical to that described with reference to Figures 7 to 10, and it is in contact with a conductor track of the printed circuit board 2 that is connected to the grounding conductor track of the circuit, to which grounding track the end spikes 31a of the top row of pins 31 are connected.<br>
Such a variant embodiment makes it possible, similarly to the variant embodiment of Figures 5 and 6, to use the top row of pins in association with the metal sheet supported by the top portion of the fascia element to implement the first shielding element of the connector.<br><br><br>
