FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a modular well.<br>
This invention relates particularly relates to a modular well for rain water harvesting and more particularly to a modular well for a bore well recharging system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water, which is one of the basic needs for sustaining life, is becoming scarce day by day, especially clean and potable water. Ground water levels are very deep in many regions and are receding further down due to daily extraction of water. Bore wells are used to draw water from water tables deep down in the earth. Due to depletion of ground water levels day by day, effective management of water assumes paramount importance. Rainwater harvesting and recharging of borewells by collecting fresh rain water and introducing it at the source of extraction are economic ways of replenishing water losses and meeting with increasing water requirements.<br>
A well is generally constructed around a borewell with masonry work or alternatively with precast cement concrete rings one located above another and grouted together. Construction of both the above types of wells is time consuming and requires mobilization of raw materials on the site and skilled labour. In order to construct the ring type well around a borewell, the discharge line of the borewell will have to be disconnected and the borewell will have to be shut down temporarily. Being very heavy and large in size, handling of the precast rings is difficult and requires increased labour and transportation charges.   Maintenance of the above wells is also difficult as they are<br>
2<br><br>
either in accessible or require ladders or slings to enter the wells and come out of the wells for repairs and cleaning purposes.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a modular well, particularly a modular well for rain water harvesting and more particularly a modular well for a borewell recharging system, which can be easily assembled on site within reduced time even by unskilled persons.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a modular well, particularly a modular well for rain water harvesting and more particularly a modular well for a borewell recharging system, which offers flexibility of storage volume.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a modular well, particularly a modular well for rain water harvesting and more particularly a modular well for a borewell recharging system, which reduces transportation charges and overall cost and is, therefore, economical.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a modular well, particularly a modular well for rain water harvesting and more particularly a modular well for a borewell recharging system, whose maintenance is easy and convenient.<br>
3<br><br>

onto the bottom element by inserting spherical balls 8 in each of the semispherical recesses at the upper surface of the bottom element and corresponding semispherical recess at the lower surface of each of the vertical elements. The top element is held onto the vertical elements by inserting spherical balls 8 in each of the semispherical recesses at the upper surface of each of the vertical elements and corresponding semispherical recesses at the lower surface of the top element. The spherical balls comprise hard materials like stainless steel or marbles. The module remains in position in the pit against the side wall of the pit under gravity and under the influence of the earth forces. 9 is a lid for the opening in the top element. The opening in the top element may be provided with a step (not shown) corresponding to the lid so as to locate the lid over the opening in the top element. All the elements including the lid are made of mechanically strong corrosion resistant, durable and non-porous material. Preferably the elements and the lid are precast with cement concrete or reinforced cement concrete. The elements and the lid can also be made of any other mechanically strong corrosion resistant, durable and non-porous material such as plastics, metals or composite materials. The side walls of the vertical elements are chamfered to maintain close contact between adjacent vertical elements. In order to facilitate handling, the bottom and top elements each may be made in two or more parts.   Preferably the module comprises eight<br><br>
vertical elements each having 10.75cm height, 5.75cm width and 4.0cm thickness. The sidewalls of the vertical elements are chamfered at 22.5°. The bottom and top elements each is octagonal shaped and is having thickness of 5.0cm. The vertical elements are arranged octagonally to form an octagonal shaped module as shown in Figs 1 and 2. An octagonal shaped module comprising eight vertical elements having the above dimensions can give a storage volume of about 1600 litres. Rain water is collected in the modular well.<br>
11<br><br>
The modular well as illustrated in Figs 7 and 8 of the accompanying drawings comprises two modules namely a bottom module lb and a top module 1c. Each of the modules is similar in construction as the module of Fig 1. The top element of the bottom module constituting the bottom element of the top module also forms a step 10a in the well as is seen in Fig 8 of the drawings. The top element of the top module is provided with the lid.<br>

Water in the bottom module further percolates down through the filter bed in the bottom module into the central pipe via the perforated portion of the lower part of the central pipe. Filtered water is collected at the open lower end of the central pipe.<br>
The modular well as shown in Fig 14 of the accompanying drawings consists of 3 modules 1j, 1k and 1l similar to the modules Id, le and If respectively of Figs 9 and 10. The modular well also consists of a central pipe lie vertically fitted in the well. The lower part of the central pipe located within the bottom module is (perforated portion marked 12c). The top end of the central pipe is closed and is provided with air vents 13c and the lower end of the central pipe is open. 15 is a perforated disc horizontally located against the bottom element of the top module around the<br>
13<br><br>
central pipe through a hole (not shown) provided in the perforated disc. Perforations in the disc are marked 15a. 14a is a primary filter bed provided on the perforated disc around the central pipe within the top module. 14b is a secondary filter bed provided around the lower part of the central pipe within the bottom module. Rain water with impurities flows down through the modular well and filtered water is available at the open lower end of the central pipe as described earlier.<br>
The modular well lm as illustrated in Fig 15 of the accompanying drawings is similar to that of Fig 11 (without the central pipe) built around a bore well (not shown). The suction pipe and casing pipe of the borewell are marked 16 and 17 respectively. Portion of the casing pipe located within the modular well is perforated (perforated portion marked 17a). Filtered water flows down into the casing pipe via the perforated portion thereby making available filtered water at the source of extraction for being pumped up by the borewell.   <br>
The modular wells as illustrated in Figs 16 and<br>
17 of the accompanying drawings are similar to those of Figs 13 and 14 respectively (with but the central pipes) built around a borewell (not shown). The modules of the modular well of Fig 16 are marked 1n and 1p. The suction pipe and casing pipe of the respective borewell are marked 16 and 17 respectively. The perforated portion of the casing pipe is marked 17a. The modules of the modular well of Fig 17 are marked lq, 1r and Is. The suction pipe and casing of the respective borewell are marked 16 and 17, respectively. The perforated portion of the casing pipe is marked 17a. As described earlier filtered water flows down into the casing pipe via the perforated portion thereof thereby making available filtered water at the source of extraction for being pumped up by the borewell.<br>

According to the invention the modular well comprises flat and compact elements which can be transported in the knocked down condition and can be easily and conveniently assembled on site even by unskilled persons within a short duration. After erection on one site, the modular well can also be, if required, disassembled and reassembled on another site easily and conveniently even by unskilled persons within a short duration. The size and dimensions of the elements are such that they can be easily and conveniently handled and can be accommodated within reduced area. The height of the vertical elements is less than the normal height of an average man. Therefore, handling of the vertical element is further convenient and easy. The bottom and top elements each can be made in two or more parts to render transportation and handling easier and more convenient. Because the elements are not very heavy and large in size even primitive transports like bullock carts can be used to transport the elements to remote and inaccessible villages or rural areas. The modular well can be constructed by simply locating the bottom elements against the bottom of the pit, inserting spherical balls in the semispherical recesses at the upper surface of the bottom element, engaging the semispherical recesses at the lower surface of the vertical elements over the spherical balls in the semispherical recesses at the upper surface of the bottom element, inserting spherical balls in the semispherical recesses at upper surface of the vertical elements and engaging the semispherical recesses at the lower surface of the top element over the semispherical balls at the upper surface of the vertical elements. The joints between the elements may be grouted if necessary. The modular construction of the well also gives the advantage and flexibility of increasing the storage volume by correspondingly increasing the size of each module and also the number of modules. There can be more than three modules for the modular well. The modular well can be easily and conveniently constructed around a borewell, even an existing borewell. As the modular well is constructed by arranging the vertical elements around the borewell and as the<br>
15<br><br>
top and bottom elements can be in two or more pieces and can be located around the borewell from the sides, the modular well can be constructed without disconnecting the discharge line of the borewell and without shutting down the borewell. The filter bed(s) is/are optional and the modular well optionally filters the water. As the height of a single module is less than the height of an average man, a workman can enter the modular well comprising a single module easily for repairs and maintenance. In the case of a multi module well, the steps in the modular well make it convenient and easy for a workman to climb down into the well and climb up out of the well. Therefore, a multi module well can also be easily accessed and repaired and cleaned. Change of filter bed is thus easy and convenient. In the case of a modular well comprising elements which are precast with cement concrete or reinforced cement concrete there is considerable cost reduction. As the cost of the elements and the transportation cost of the elements and also the cost of making the modular wells is reduced, the overall cost of the well is reduced and the well works out to be very economical especially for the underprivileged living in the rural areas and villages. The modular well is essentially for water, especially for harvesting rain water and more particularly for a borewell recharging system. It can also be used for handling any other liquid. The holding means may be of a different construction. The lid is optional. The bottom and top elements can be single piece construction. The modules need not be octagonal. Such variations of the invention are obvious to those skilled in the art and are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
