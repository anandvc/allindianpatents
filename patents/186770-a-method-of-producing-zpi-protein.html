				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing ZP1 protein.<br>
Abbreviations used   :   A, absorbance (1cm): aa. amino acid(s); bp. base pairs:<br>
[PTG. isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside: kb. kilobase(s) or lOOObp: Ni-NTA. N'ickle nitrilo-tri-acetic acid; nt nucleotide(s); PCR. polymerase chain reaction; r-. recombinant: ZP, zona pellucida; ZP I, zona pellucida glycoprotein-1. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART R£FRENCES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The mammalian egg is surrounded by an acellular translucent envelope, the zona pellucida (ZP), comprised of acidic glycoproteins, which are synthesized and secreted during oocyte growth and follicular development (Wassarman. vol 57. Ann Rev Biochem 415-442. 1988). ZP glycoproteins mediate critical steps in fertilization process including initial attachment followed by tight binding of spermatozoa to the ZP. induction of the acrosome reaction, and affecting a block co polyspermv. This critical role in reproduction together with their tissue specific nature have made the ZP glycoproteins potential candidate antigens for immunocontraceptive vaccine.<br>
To test the efficacy of ZP giycoproteins for immunocontraception, female subjects from several species were immunized with pig zona pellucida glycoproteins isolated from ovaries. Such an immunization leads to block of fertilitv (Skinner et<br><br>
al vol 115, Endocrinol 2418-2432, 1984; Mahi-Brown et al., vol 32, Biol Reprod 761-772, 1985; Dunbar et al., vol 52, Fertil Steril 311-318, 1989; Paterson et al., vol 46, Biol Reprod 523-534, 1992). However, it is invariably associated with either a transient or irreversible alteration in the cyclicity, hormonal profile and follicular development in the ovary. Impairment of ovarian function is considerably reduced, if not completely eliminated, by the use of purified ZP glycoproteins along with permissible adjuvants such as alum, sodium phthalyl derivative of lipopolysaccharide and muramyl dipeptide instead of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sacco et al., vol 21, Am J Rep Immunol 1-8, 1989; Bagavant et al., vol 102, J Reprod Fertil 17-25, 1994). Active immunization studies with glycosylated and deglycosylated porcine ZP antigens, in rabbit model system have atrributed ovarian pathology to glycosylation (Keenan et al., vol 44, Biol Reprod 150-156, 1991; Jones et al., vol 95, J Reprod Fertil 513-525, 1992). Molecular characterization of ZP glycoproteins from various species led to the identification of three major proteins termed as ZPI (ZPB), ZP2 (ZPA) and ZP3 (ZPC) (Harris et al., vol 4, DNA Sequence 361-393, 1994; Castle and Dean: vol 50, J Reprod Fertil Supp 1-8, 1996). On the basis of the size of mRNA's ZP2 is the longest and ZP3 smallest [Harris et al., vol 4, DNA Sequence 361-393. 1994] ZPI has been cloned and sequenced from mouse (Epifano et al., vol 270, J Biol Chem 27254-27258, 1995), human (Harris et al., vol 4, DNA Sequence 361-393, 1994). rabbit (Schwoebal et al., Vol 266, J Biol Chem, 7214-7219, 1991). pig<br><br>
(Yurewicz et al., Vol 1174, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 211-214, 1993) and cat (Harris et al., vol 4, DNA Sequence 361-393, 1994). In mouse, three zona transcripts have been detected uniquely in the ovary, where their expression is restricted to oocytes [Ringuette et al., vol 83, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 4341-4345. 1986; Liang et al., vol 10, Mol Cell Biol 1507-1515, 1990; Epifano et al., vol 121. Development 1947-1956, 1995]. However, in cynomolgus monkey ZP2 and ZP3 transcript is present in oocytes at all stages of folliculogenesis including granulosa cells [Martinez et al., vol 50, J Reprod Fertil Supp 35-41, 1996]. However, ZP1 transcript is present in oocytes in secondary follicles and to lesser extend in tertiary follicles but absent in primordial, primary or antral follicles and granulosa cells [Martinez et al., vol 50, J Reprod Fertil Supp 35-41, 1996]. To avoid or minimize ovarian dysfunction for a ZP glycoprotein based immunocontraceptive vaccine for human application, it will be desirable that the candidate antigen is not present on the primordial/primary follicles and granulosa cells. To design a vaccine for human use, it will be desirable to either use human zona proteins or those having a high sequence homology with human zona proteins so as to elicit an immune response capable of inhibiting more efficiently the human sperm-egg interaction. So far full length ZP1 gene has not been cloned from any non-human primate. The present invention far the first time describes the full length ZP 1 cDNA clone isolation from bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) and its complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence. For immunocontraceptive<br><br>
purpose, large amount of ZP1 in a pure form without contamination of other<br>
ovarian associated antigens will be required. Toward this goal in this invention, we<br>
have establish a procedure for the expression of bonnet monkey ZP1 in E. coli as a<br>
6XHis fusion protein for its convenient purification. An ELISA system employing<br>
recombinant ZP1 coated microtitration plate for the quantitation of antibodies<br>
agains ZP1 has also been established.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
To meet the above requirements, the objects of the present invention  provide a<br>

or permanent infertility in a mammal.<br>

or its fragments to induce reversible or permanent infertility in a mammal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above objects are acheived by providing a method of inducing  reversible or<br>
permanent   infertility in a mammal which comprises   immunization of the said<br>
mammal with a recombinant ZP 1 or its fragments derived from Macaca radiant<br>

30, transferring the recombinant ZP1 pQE 30 vector obtained above in a host cell<br>
such as  SG13009[pREP4], BL21(DE3) and BL21(plysS), expressing ZP1 protein<br>
by growing transfected host cells in suitable nutrient conditions and obtaining the<br>
ZP 1 or its fragments by any known method.<br>
The recombinant ZP1 or its fragments are derived  by methods   such as   genetic<br>
engineering or chemical synthesis.<br><br>
Zona pellucida glycoproteins have been proposed as candidate antigens for immunocontraception. Recent observations in cynomolgus monkey about the presence of ZPl transcript only in the oocytes of secondary follicles and its absence in the primordial/primary follicles and granulosa cells [Martinez et al., vol 50, J Reprod Fertil Supp, 35-41, 1996] prompted us to clone and sequence the bonnet monkey ZP1 gene. These studies can be facilitated by the availability of recombinant proteins. A cDNA λgtll library was constructed using poly-Af mRNA isolated from bonnet monkey (Macaca radiatd) ovaries and screened tor bonnet ZP1 using 404bp (818-1221 nt) human ZP1 fragment as probe. Bonnet ZP1 cDNA comprises of 1617 nt and encode a polypeptide of 539 aa residues which shares 91.09% overall identity with human ZP1. The major difference between bonnet ZPl versus human ZP1 is the deletion of 28 aa domain (100-127 aa residues corresponding to human ZPl). An internal fragment (1317 bp) of bonnet ZPl, excluding the N-terminus signal sequence and the C-termmus transmembrane-like domain was amplified by PCR. The amplified Sac 1 and Kpn I restricted fragment was cloned in frame downstream of the T5 promoter under the lac operator control for expression in the pQE-30 vector. Recombinant ZPl (r-ZPI) was expressed as a poly-histidine fusion protein in E. coli strains SG130009[pREP4] and ompT and Ion proteases deficient BL21(DE3) and BL21(plysS). Partial ZPl sequence has also been reported from the Cynomolgous monkey [Harris et al., International Patent Publication Number WO 94/11019.<br><br>
1994]. These investigators failed to isolate full length ZP1 cDNA clones inspite of exhaustive screening of the two cynomolgous monkey ovarian cDNA libraries with porcine ZP1 probe. An insert of 866 bp encoding a polypeptide of 270 aa corresponding to the C-terminus and approximately 50% of the expected full length sequence has been reported. Comparison of 270 aa corresponding to cynomolgous monkey ZP1 with bonnet ZP1 revealed changes in only 8 aa of which three are after the predicted furine cleavage site. Bonnet ZP1 has tri-basic (R-R-R) cleavage site beginning 464 aa which is similar to human ZP1. However, cynomolgous monkey ZP1 has only 2 instead of 3 arginine residues. On the basis of von Heijne's [vol 14, Nuc Acid Res 4683-4690, 1986] scoring method, bonnet ZP1 has a potential peptidase site after the 21st amino acid resulting in a N-terminal lysine. It does not have a 3' untranslated region, since the translation stop codon TAA coincides with the RNA polyadenylation signal, a feature common to the rnRNA from human, mouse, rabbit, pig and cat. Comparison of the deduced aa sequence of precursor bonnet ZP1 protein revealed highest sequence identity with human (91.09%) and lowest with mouse (36.55%; not shown in Fig. aV). The low sequence homology of bonnet ZP1 with mouse ZP1 is attributed to elongated exons 3 and 12 of mouse ZP1 [Castle and Dean, vol 50, J Reprod Fertil Suppl 1-8. 1996]. There are 7 aa residues which are unique in bonnet ZP1 (aa residues at position 2, 16, 120, 121, 455, 469 and 523 of precursor bonnet ZP1 protein) which are otherwise conserved in human, pig, rabbit and cat ZP1. There are 24 aa<br><br>
residues, identical and unique to both human and bonnet ZP1 (aa residues 12, 30. 77, 113, 116, 142, 146, 161, 187, 191, 217, 222, 266, 267, 268, 273. 282. 293. 430, 439, 451, 468, 479 and 506 numbered according to the bonnet ZP1 precursor protein) which otherwise are conserved in pig, rabbit and cat. At the moment, it is not clear whether repetition of ~500 bp N-terminal fragment is an artifact introduced while packaging cDNA into A-gtl 1 or is due to a partial gene duplication. The 3' nt sequence of ~500 bp fragment does not match with Xgtl 1 arm used for packaging and is likely not an artifact of packaging. In chicken, progesterone receptor A and B proteins are synthesized from the same mRNA by alternate initiation sites from two in frame AUG codons [Conneely et al., vol 264, J Biol Chem 14062-14064, 1989]. The chicken progesterone receptor B protein differs from A protein by an additional 128 aa located at the N-terminus. The evolutionary and functional significance of two forms of the steroid hormone receptor has been unclear. Whether such a possibility exist for expression of ZP1 in non-human primates is at best a speculation. To undertake feasibility studies of an immunocontraceptive vaccine based on bonnet ZP1, it will be desirable to have the antigen in a pure form without contamination of other ovarian associated antigens. Bonnet monkey ZP1 was expressed in E. coli as a 6XHis fusion protein for its convenient purification in a truncated form excluding the signal sequence (21 aa residues) and the C-terminal portion (77 aa residues) including the transmembrane-like domain, which will be processed by furine like proteases. On<br><br>
the SDS-PAGE the fusion protein showed an apparent molecular weight of 51 kDa. Expression level was reasonably high (7.5 mg/L in a batch flask culture) though some amount of degradation of the expressed protein was evident in the Western blots. The degradation of r-ZPl was not either eliminated nor reduced with expression of the protein in a Ion and ompT protease deficient strain BL21(plysS) indicating that some other and not these proteases were responsible for the degradation observed.<br>
Immunoblot with a murine monoclonal antibody, MA-410 (raised against porcine ZP3α - a homologue of bonnet ZP1, and crossreactive with bonnet zona pellucida) revealed a band of 51 kDa besides truncated fragments. Optimum expression of r-ZP1 was observed at 0.5 mM IPTG. Immunization of male rabbits with r-ZPl purified on Ni-NTA resin under denaturing conditions and female rabbits with i -ZP1 conjugated with diptheria toxoid (DT) generated antibodies reactive with r-ZP1 in ELISA. The bonnet monkey r-ZPl was highly immunogenic in both male and female rabbits and anti-r-ZPl antibodies recognized the bonnet monkey zona pellucida. Protein expressed in a prokaryotic expression system are not glycosylated. Active immunization studies with glycosylated and deglycosylated porcine ZP antigens, in the rabbit model system have attributed ovarian pathology to glycosylation [Keenan et al., vol 44, Biol Reprod 150-156, 1991; Jones et al.. vol 95, J Reprod Fertil 513-525, 1992]. Recently, cynomolgous monkeys had been immunized with the rabbit zona protein rc55 ( a homologue of bonnet monkey<br><br>
ZPI) expressed in a procaryotic expression system as cro-p-galactosidase fusion protein and coupled to KLH/Protein -A. Antibody response against the rc55 inliibited homologous sperm-egg interaction without concomitant disturbance in cyclicity or any associated ovarian pathology [VandeVoort et al., vol 64, Feitil Steril 830-847, 1995]. Moreover, polyclonal antibodies against bonnet r-ZPl when tested by indirect immunofluorescence on bonnet monkey ovarian section, showed positive fluorescence with zona pellucida. The information on sequence based on bonnet ZP1 and availability of recombinant protein will help in better understanding and evaluation of homologous immunization in a non-human primate model, the contraceptive potential of the immunocontraceptive vaccine of i-ZPI. Active immunization of primates such as female bonnet monkeys and female baboons of proven fertility with r-ZPl conjugated to DT, tetanus toxoid (TT) or circumsporozoite protein are in progress.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a method of inducing reversible or permanent infertility in a mammal, which comprises immunization of the said mammal with a recombinant ZP 1 or its fragments derived from Macaca radiaia. The mammal to be treated may include primates such as monkey, baboon and langoor, apes such as chimpanjee and humans.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of wherein ZP 1 protein or its fragments are obtained by any known method such as recombinant DNA technology or chemical synthesis.<br><br>
The invention, in addition, relates to administering a dosage of ZP1 or its fragments along with suitable adjuvants, diluents and carriers to induce transient or permanent infertility in the mammal. The adjuvant is selected from sodium pthalyl derivative of lipopolysaccharide, Muramyl dipeptide, Squalene (C10Hso) and Mannide monooleate and the carrier is selected from DT, TT and circumsporozoite protein. Preferred diluents are saline, PBS with any suitable stabilizing agents.<br>

PREFERRED   MATERIALS   AND   METHODS   INVOLVED    IN    THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Bonnet monkey ovarian cDNA library, screening and sequencing of ZP1<br>
clones: Ovaries were collected from a 2-year old female bonnet monkey, snap<br>
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until used. Total RNA was isolated<br>
from frozen ovaries and poly-A+ fraction purified by using the polyATtract inRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). cDNA was synthesized<br><br>
from the purified poly-A+ RNA by using Riboclone cDNA synthesis system (Piomega, Madison, WI, USA) and cloned in A,gtll to construct a library (Packagene Lambda DNA Packaging System, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The constructed bonnet monkey ovarian cDNA A,gtll library had 1.79xl06 independent plaques with 96% recombinant prior to amplification. The A,gtl 1 ovarian cDNA library was screened using human ZP1 404bp (818-1221nt) fragment (provided by Dr. Jurien Dean, Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, NIH, Bethesda, USA). Six positive clones were obtained by plaque hybridization of amplified library with 404 bp fragment of human ZP1 cDNA<br>
Insert from the positive clones was PCR amplified by means of Xgtl 1 forward (5'-<br>
GGTGGCGACGACTCCTGGAGCCCG-3')	and	reverse	(5-<br>
TTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3') primers; this involved initial melt at<br>
94°C for 10 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for 2 min and 72°C for 3 mm followed by a final extension at 72°C for 15 min. The PCR amplification was can led out in 50pl with Taq polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) The amplified cDNA fragment was resolved by electrophoresis and purified by use of the Genecleanll kit (Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The product was cloned in pCRScript SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and sense strand sequenced using T3 (5'-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3') and T7 (5'-<br><br>
GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3') primers by the dideoxy chain termination method. The complete sequence of the insert was determined by following two different strategies i) Digesting the insert with EcoRl, cloning EcoRI digested fragments into pCRScript SK(+) followed by sequencing and ii) sequencing the full insert by designing and synthesizing the internal primers. Amino acid sequence was derived using the DNASIS Program. Various characteristics of the ZP1 sequence was analyzed by PC/Gene (Intelligenetics, Inc.). The multiple alignment of the ZP1 aa sequence of different species with the bonnet monkey ZP1 sequence was carried out using the Clustal V Multiple Alignment Program [Higgins and Sharp, vol 5, CABIOS 151-153, 1989].<br>
Amplification of the insert by PCR using A,gtll forward and reverse primers and its analysis by electrophoresis revealed one clone (clone 5) to be 2.1 kb, two clones (clones 23 and 25) 1.6 kb and three clones (clones 22, 24 and 28) were smaller than 1.6 kb (Data not shown). The PCR amplified product from three clones (5, 23, 25) was cloned into pCRScript SK(+) vector. Sequences from both ends of these three fragments revealed that the clone 5 has a full length cDNA with both the translation initiation codon (ATG) and termination codon (TAA) along with the poly-A tail at the 3' end whereas clones 23 and 25 have the translation termination codon but not the translation initiation codon. Further mapping of the clone 5 with EcoR I resulted in 4 inserts of ~ 750, 550, 500, and -250 bp. Nucleotide sequence revealed that both -500 (474 nt) and -<br><br>
550 bp fragments have respective translation initiation codon and -500 bp fragment had identical sequence (except 42 nt at the 3'-end) as that of -550bp fragment. The -550 bp fragment had Xhol restriction site and one additional site was also present in the pCRScript SK(+) vector. Digestion of clone 5 with Xhol, generated two fragments of 3.9 and 1.2 kb, indicating that -550 bp fragment is after -500 bp fragment (Fig. 1). Hence, the order of the various fragments in the clone 5 was N( - -500 bp- -550 bp- -750 bp- -250 bp- C.<br>
Clones 23 and 25 showed identical sequence and hence the sequence of only clone 25 is presented (Fig. 2). Clone 25 could only be read from 148bp after ATG and was almost similar to clone 5 except for 6 extra nucleotide at 521 nt position and deletion of three nucleotides after 1392 nt. It has a single open reading frame of 1617 nt, resulting in a polypeptide core of 539 aa in length with a calculated molecular mass of 59265 (Fig. 3). A potential signal peptidase site with aa at the -1 and -3 positions that are in accordance with the rule proposed by von Heijne [vol 14, Nuc Acid Res 4683-4690, 1986] is found after 21 aa in bonnet ZP1 Comparison of the deduced aa sequence revealed that bonnet monkey ZP1 protein had a 28 aa deletion from 100-127 aa as compared to human ZP1 (Fig. 4). The bonnet ZP1 aa sequence showed 91.09% identity with the human ZPI The mature protein excluding the N-terminal signal sequence region and C-terminal transmembrane-like domain which would presumably be processed in a mature molecule had an identity of 94.4% with the corresponding human protein. Ammo<br><br>
acid sequence identity with rabbit is 65.17%, pig 62.8%, and that with cat 64.75% (Fig. 4). Out of 539 aa, 249 aa are conserved in all the 5 species (shown in Fig 4 by underline). The bonnet ZP1 polypeptide chain contains 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). Two potential cAMP and cGMP -dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites at position 249 and 469 are found in bonnet ZP1 protein. It has 7 potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at positions 186, 212, 244, 245, 455, 463 and 480. The protein was also found to have 9 N-myristoylation sites at positions 111, 166, 168, 182, 268, 273. 328. 511 and 520. The bonnet ZP1 polypeptide is rich in leucine (11.1%), serine (10.2%). valine (8.7%) and proline (7.7%). The conformation of bonnet ZP1 protein is 18 1% helical, 28.2% extended and 53.6% as coils. By Hopp and Woods [vol 78. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 3824-3828, 1981] analysis, taking an average group of 6 aa residues three domain corresponding to 492-497 aa (Ah = 2.0), 461-467 aa (Ah 1.75) and 118-124 aa (Ah = 1.7) residues having highest hydrophilicity are observed. The analysis of bonnet ZP1 sequence further revealed two predicted transmembrane segments corresponding to LLQCVLLCVSLSLVLSG (3-19 aa residues) and VLWVAGLSGTLILGGLV (506-528 aa residues) motifs [Klein et al., vol 815, Biophys et Biochim Acta 468-476, 1985].<br><br>
Cloning of bonnet monkey ZP1 cDNA in E. coli expression vector<br>
An internal fragment of the cDNA, excluding the signal sequence and the<br>
transmembrane-like domain, following the putative furine cleavage site, was<br>
amplified by PCR using the forward primer	5'-<br>
GGTGAGCTCAAGCCTGAGACCAGGT-3' incorporating a SacI site and the reverse primer 5'-TCTGGTACCGAGATCAGGACAGGT-3' incorporating a Kpnl site The PCR was done in a 50 pi volume using 50 pmole of each primer and Vent polymerase (NEB Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) for extension. The pBluesci ipt-<br>
ZP1 (clone 5, 10 ng) was used as the template and was initially denatured at 95 °C for 10 min. Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 rnin, primer annealing at 55°C for 2 min and extension at 72°C for 3 mm<br>
followed by a final extension at 72°C for 15 min. The amplified 1.317 kb fragment was digested with SacI and Kpnl and cloned in frame downstream of a 6X histidine tag under the T-5 promoter-lac operator control in the pQE-30 vector (QIAexpress, Qiagen GmbH, Max-Volmer-Stra(3e4, Hilden, Germany). The design of the recombinant expression vector pQE-ZPl is given in Fig. 5. The pQE-ZPl plasmid was transformed in SG13009[pREP4] bacterial strains provided with the kit. In addition BL21(DE3) and BL21(plysS) cells, deficient in omp T and Ion proteases, were also transformed with the pQE-ZPl plasmid. It is also possible to employ any other suiatable host cells for obtaining the recombinant ZP1.<br><br>
For expression of recombinant ZP1 (r-ZPl) cloned in pQE-30 vector, a single transformed colony was inoculated and grown overnight at 37°C in 1 ml of Luna Broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) or any other suitable media containing 100 j^g/ml of ampicillin and 25 |ag/ml of kanamycin. Next morning, cells were subcultured 1:10 and grown until cell density reached an absorbance at 600 nm (A^QQ) °f approximately 0.6-0.7. The cells were further grown in the presence of IPTG to induce expression of the fusion protein under the T-5 promoter. Conditions with respect to the time and IPTG concentration used for induction of r-ZPl were standardized. The cells were collected by centrifugation<br>
at l3,OOOXg for 60 sec and the resulting pellet was stored at -70°C until used<br>
The cell pellet obtained from 1 ml culture was solubilized by boiling for 5 min in 100 jal of 2X sample buffer (0.0625 M Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol. 5% p-mercaptoethanol and 0.001% bromophenol blue) and the proteins were resolved on a 0.1% SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel [Laemmeli, vol 227, Nature 680-6K5. 1970]. The proteins were electrophoretically blotted to 0.45 pni nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) overnight at a constant voltage of 15 V in Tris glycine buffer with 20% methanol [Towbin et al., vol 76, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 4350-4354, 1979]. For immunoblotting, nonspecific sites on the membrane were blocked by incubation with 5% BSA in 50 mM phosphate<br><br>
buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 for 1 h followed by 3 washes (15 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST). For detection of bonnet monkey r-ZPl a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), MA-410 generated against porcine ZP3a (a homologue of bonnet monkey ZP1) and immunologically cross-reactive with bonnet ZP has been used. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with a 1:5 dilution of MA-410 culture supernatant, followed by 3 washes in PBST Hoi seradish-peroxidase (HRPO) conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Ig) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to reveal bound antibody. Color was developed with 0.6% (w/v) 4-chloro-napthol in 50 mM PBS containing 25% methanol and 0.06% H2O2- The reaction was stopped by washing the membrane<br>
with PBS.<br>
The typical results obtained by 0.1%SDS-10%PAGE and immunoblot from one of the transformed clones is shown in Fig. 6. The fusion protein had an apparent molecular weight of 51 kDa. The optimum expression was obtained at 0.5 mM IPTG. The expression of ZP1 was tightly regulated as the same was not observed in the uninduced transformed bacterial cell (Fig. 6). Higher IPTG levels seems to inhibit growth of transformed bacterial cells without any further increase in expression levels of r-ZPl. Cellular localization revealed that the fusion protein was present in the insoluble intracellular fraction and was not secreted in the periplasm (Data not shown).<br><br>
The r-ZPl was also expressed in BL21(plysS) cells deficient in the ompT and Ion proteases. The pattern obtained in the Western blot was comparable to that obtained with SG13009(pREP4) (Fig. 7). Moreover, r-ZPl was observed in absence of IPTG suggesting that its expression is not highly regulated Purification and conjugation of r-ZPl with diphtheria toxoid and immunization.<br>
For purification, the r-ZPl fusion protein was expressed at the shake flask level (250 ml culture/flask; total volume 2 L). Cells were pelleted down at l,500Xg for<br>
30 min at 4°C and stored at -70°C till used. The cell pellet (1 g) was solubilized in 5 ml of buffer A (6 M Guanidine hydrochloride, O.I M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M<br>
Tris. pH 8.0). The suspension was centrifuged at 10,OOOXg for 5 min at 4°C and the supernatant containing the r-fusion protein was mixed with gentle end to end shaking for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with the Ni-NT A resin (Qiagen GmbH, Max-Volmer-Strape 4, Hilden, Germany). The resin was loaded on a column and washed with 5 volumes of buffer A. The column was subsequently washed with 5 volumes each of buffers B and C which contained 8 M Urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4 and<br>
0.01 M Tris and had successively reducing pH values of 8 and 6.3 The recombinant fusion protein was eluted with buffers D and E in which the pH was further reduced to 5.9 and 4.5 respectively. The eluted protein was concentrated in an Amicon concentrator using a YM5 membrane (Amicon Corp., Lexington, MA.<br><br>
USA) and then dialyzed against 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 having 4 M urea. The purified protein was quantitated with bicinchoninic acid (Sigma Chemicals Co, St. Louis, MO, USA).<br>
From a 2 L batch culture, approximately 15 mg of purified r-ZPl was obtained and used to immunize male rabbits.<br>
Five milligram of r-ZPl was conjugated to 2.5 mg of diphtheria toxoid (DT; Serum Institute, Pune, India) using the "one step" glutaraldehyde coupling procedure [Avarameas, vol.6, Immunochem 43-53, 1969], Conjugation was done in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with 4 M urea using 0.1% glutaraldehyde. overnight at RT (room temperature) with gentle end to end mixing. Unreacted sites were blocked with 100 mM lysine for 3 h at RT. The conjugate was dialysed against 10 mM PBS having 0.3 M urea.<br>
Two 6 month old male NZW rabbits (Small Experimental Animal Facility, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India) were immunized with 200 j.i g of r-ZPl emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant intradermally at multiple sites. The animals were boosted after 4 weeks with an equivalent amount of r-ZPl in incomplete Freund's adjuvant intramuscularly. In addition, 2 six month old female NZW rabbits were also immunized with r-ZPl-DT conjugate (equivalent to 200 jag r-ZP I/animal) following the procedure as described for the male rabbits Seven days after the booster, animals were bled to characterize the antibody response.<br><br>
Reactivity of anti-r-ZPl antibodies was tested by a direct binding EL IS A Microtitration plates were coated with either 200 ng of r-ZPl or 500 ng of DT per well in 50 mM PBS, pH 7.4 for 1 h at 37°C followed by overnight at 4°C. All subsequent incubations were at 37°C for 1 h. After each incubation the plates were washed three times in 50 mM PBS having 0.05% Tween-20. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA. After blocking, 100 jjJ of doubling dilutions of the preimmune and immune serum samples were added in duplicate. HRPO conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) at 1:5000 dilution was used as revealing antibodies. Enzyme activity was revealed by adding 100 |ul of 0.05% orthophenylene diamine and 0.06% H2®2 m 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) in each well and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 jjJ/well of 5 N H2SO4. A492 was read and antibody titres were calculated by regression analysis. Antibody litre is expressed as antibody unit i.e. dilution of serum giving an absorbance of 1.0.<br>
Immunization of male rabbits, R-136 and R-137, resulted in the generation of high antibody titres 926672 and 939283 antibody units against r-ZPl respectively (Table 1). High antibody titres against r-ZPl and DT were also observed in the immunized female rabbits. However, in contrast to the male rabbits, 5 to 7 fold lower anti- r-ZP 1 antibody titres were observed in female animals.<br><br>

Not Applicable Immunofluorescence on bonnet monkey ovarian sections.<br>
Normal cycling female monkey (10 years) was ovarectomised, the ovaries snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and sections of 5 jim thickness were cut in a cryostat at<br>
~20°C and fixed for 20 min in chilled methanol. Sections passing through a follicle were selected, washed in PBS and blocked for 30 min in 5% normal goat serum The sections were incubated at 37°C with 1:2000 dilution of rabbit preimmune and immune   sera for 1 h, washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Ig-FITC conjugate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Slides<br><br><br>
were washed with PBS and mounted in Glycerol " PBS (9:1) and examined under<br>
fluorescent microscope (Optiphot, Nikon, Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, Japan).<br>
For proving the authenticity of recombinant protein it is imperative to show that<br>
antiserum generated against the r-ZPl recognizes the native protein. Rabbit antiserum<br>
against r-ZPl showed intense fluorescence with the zona pellucide on sections from the<br>
bonner   monkey   ovary   (Fig.8).   the   pre-immune   serum   failed   to   show   any<br>
immunofluorescence (Data not shown). Moreover, the fluorescence was specific to the<br>
zona matrix and the antibodies did not react with other ovarian cell types.<br>
