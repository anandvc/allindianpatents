TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"Interconnecting Disengageable Flooring System."<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to flooring surfaces, preferably decorative flooring surfaces. In addition, the present invention relates to a system for constructing a flooring surface, e.g., a decorative flooring surface. More specifically, the present invention relates to thin laminate flooring surfaces comprising a top wear surface, preferably decorative in nature, a substrate reinforcing material or layer, and optionally, a backing material or layer. The present invention also relates to components, systems, and methods for constructing a disengageable decorative laminate flooring surface from individual flooring panels. In addition, the present invention relates to decorative laminate flooring products or components, e.g., panels and elements for connecting the panels.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various systems have been proposed in an attempt to provide a means for easily constructing a flooring surface; however, none to date have found overwhelming acceptance in the market place, especially in relation to disengageable thin laminate "floating floor" surfaces. A number of the known proposed systems are discussed to provide a background for the present invention.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,310,919 titled "Portable Floor," discloses a floor comprising a plurality of like panels having straight sides, coupling elements at said sides for coupling arrangement with cooperating coupling elements on adjacent panels, and means operatively<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
associated with said coupling elements for releasably locking adjacent panels in a side-by-side contiguous relationship. As illustrated in Figure 2, the panels are coupled together using locking screws 19 and nails 15.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,657,852 titled "Floor Tiles," discloses a floor or tile consisting either of a single piece composed of any one of a range of different materials or a plurality of superimposed laminations each composed of any one of a range materials. The floor tiles are formed with a plurality of identical, laterally projecting tongues and, in their underside, with an equal number of identical pockets which open to the periphery of the tiles and alternate around the periphery with the tongues. The tongues and pockets being so shaped that any tongue of any one of the tiles is adapted to engage and fit within any pocket of any one of the other tiles and when so engaged, it is held against endwise withdrawal from the pocket so that, when the two tiles are located in a common plane, relative movement there between in said plane is prevented.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,449,346 titled 'Tanel Assembly," discloses a panel assembly including at least two panels and a connector member for mounting the panels to a support surface, the panels being positioned edge-to-edge in coplanar relationship with the respective confronting edges thereof spaced apart, and the connector member between the confronting panel edges and interlocking the panels together by being fixedly secured to the support surface. Each panel has first and second surfaces in first and second parallel planes and each has on its respective edge a tongue and a groove. The tongue and groove extend along the panel edge in. between the first and second planes, and respectively project an opening outwardly angularly towards the first plane. The connector member comprises an elongated body filling the space between the confronting panel edges and having on each side thereof a<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
tongue and a groove respectively projecting an opening outwardly angularly towards the second plane. The tongue and groove on either side are complimentary to lockingly engage with the respective groove and tongue on the adjacent respective confronting edges of the panel. The connector member cooperates with the panels to urge the panels toward one another in a tight locking engagement as a result of a compressive force being exerted on the member in the direction toward the support surface when the member is secured to the support surface. The patent states that the provision of such a connector member does away with the heretofore known practice of driving nails or screws in the panel edges to fix the panels to the support surface, while still providing a tight locking engagement between the panels. As shown in Figure 2, the connecting member is fixedly secured to the support surface using screw 86. In addition, "the top surface 56 of the connector member 14 is coplanar with the top planar surfaces 16 and 18 of panels 10 and 12" and therefore, forms a part of the top wear surface - which is readily visible.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,135,339 titled "Slatted Floor System," discloses a slatted floor system which is said to be easily assembled, provides firm footing and comfort to confined animals, resists corrosion, discourages accumulation of animal waste, is easily cleaned, and can be used to span significantly greater distances than prior art slats. The slatted floor system is stated to comprise a plurality of elongated, spaced, generally parallel slats. Each slat has a top, load-carrying surface with spaced apart, opposite outer edges. Each slat also has a bottom surface substantially parallel to the top surface and a pair of side surfaces integral with the top surface and the bottom surface. The side surfaces are joined with the top surface along lines recessed from the outer edges of the top surface. The side surfaces are said to further taper toward each other in first positions, adjacent to the top surface, then extend substantially<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
parallel to each other and vertically relative to the bottom surface in second portions. It is stated that this forms with the top and bottom surfaces a generally Y-shaped, enclosed main compartment. The patent discloses that each slat also includes a first pair of projection receiving means extending longitudinally along the tapered first portion of its side surfaces and a second pair of projection receiving means extending longitudinally along the second portion of the side surfaces. Adjacent slats are said to be connected and locked in spaced-apart relationship in a plurality of connectors. Each connector has a pair of projections, with each projection being receivable by one of the first pair of projection receiving means on each of two adjacent slats, and the second pair of projection receiving means on each of two adjacent slats. At least one of the first and second pairs of projections on the connectors are adapted to interlock with its corresponding projection receiving means on adjacent slats. As stated above, and shown in Figures 1 and 4, the upper wear surface of the slats are spaced apart to provide a gap to facilitate the object of the invention, i.e., for discouraging the accumulation of animal waste. In addition, as shown in the same figures, the projections and connector means can only be assembled by sliding the edges of the slats and connector together when held in parallel coplanar relationship to one another. And as shown, the connector member does not extend the entire length of the slat members.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,461,131 titled "Panel Interconnection System," discloses an assembly of panels of rectangular shape, as for example, a floor, in which the panels comprise upper and lower ridged sheets separated by a core, elongated fittings extending along adjacent edges of adjacent panels and having lateral extension receipt means between edge portions of the sheets of the panels.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present inventive system is directed to decorative laminate flooring panels, squares, tiles, rectangles, etc. each having a top wear surface, a middle substrate or reinforcing material below the top surface, and optionally, a backing layer surface attached to the middle substrate material for contact with the supporting or existing floor or ground surface.<br>
The top wear surface of the panels of the present invention, preferably comprises decorative laminates or laminates prepared by heat and pressure consolidation. These panels have been produced commercially for a number of years, and have found widespread acceptance in the building and furniture industry as counter and table tops, bathroom and kitchen work surfaces, wall paneling, partitions and doors. Such decorative laminates can be described as containing a number of laminae that are consolidated to form a composite or unitary structure carrying a surface decoration which can range from something as simple as a solid color to something as complex as an embossed simulated wood grain finish.<br>
More specifically, a decorative laminate, useful in the present invention, generally comprises a plurality of layers of synthetic resin impregnated paper sheets consolidated or bonded together into a unitary structure under heat and pressure. In normal practice, the decorative laminate assembly, from the bottom up, consists of a core of one or more sheets impregnated with phenolic resin, above which lies a decorative "sheet impregnated with melamine resin and/or an overlay impregnated with melamine resin. The core or base member functions to impart rigidity to the laminate and usually comprises a solid substrate which may or may not be formed prior to the initial laminating step. Prior to stacking, th<br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
sheets of the core member are impregnated with a water alcohol solution of phenol and formaldehyde or a formaldehyde precursor, dried and partially cured in a hot air oven, and finally cut into sheets. Examples of such a base or core member include: (1) a plurality of sheets of 90 to 150 pound ream kraft paper impregnated throughout and bonded with a substantially completely cured phenolic resin which has been converted to the thermoset state during the initial laminating step; (2) a precured plastic laminate such as glass fiber-reinforced thermoset polyester resin laminates or the like; (3) a wood product such as hardboard, fiberboard, woodwaste, particle boards, plywood or the like; (4) a mineral base board such as cement-asbestos board, sheet rock, plaster board or the like; (5) plastic impregnated boards; (6) plastic/wood compositions; (7) plastic compositions; (8) closed-cell polyurethane foam, e.g., RIM foam; (9) urethane impregnated boards; (10) a combination of these substrates; or (11) any material suitable to perform the desired function of the base or core member.<br>
The decorative sheet, useful in the panels of the present invention, generally functions to give an attractive appearance to the laminate, and also gives the panel its surface characteristics (i.e., resistance to chemical agents, to heat, to light, to shock and to abrasion). The decorative sheet typically is a high quality 50 to 125 ream weight, pigment filled, alpha cellulose paper that has been impregnated with a water-alcohol solution of melamine-formaldehyde resin, dried and partially cured, and finally cut into sheets. The decorative sheet may be of a solid color or may comprise a decorative design or pattern, or a photo reproduction of natural materials, such as, wood, marble, leather, etc. As stated above, the decorative sheet and/or an overlay sheet may be impregnated with melamine resin.<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
The decorative laminate useful in the manufacture of the panels of the present invention, is generally obtained by, but not limited to, placing the resin impregnated core and decorative sheets between steel coated, steel, or stainless steel plates and subjecting the laminate stack to temperatures ranging from about 150° F to about 500° F and pressures ranging from about 800 to about 1600 psi for a time sufficient to consolidate the laminate and cure the resins (generally about 25 minutes to an hour). This causes the resin in the paper sheets to flow, cure, and consolidate the sheets into a composite or unitary laminated mass referred to in the art as a high pressure decorative laminate (HPDL). More than one laminate can be formed at one time by inserting a plurality of assembled sheets in a stack with each assembly being separated by a release sheet which allows the individual laminates to be separated after consolidation. Finally, the decorative laminates are further processed and are generally bonded to a reinforcing substrate, such as medium to high density fiber board, wood/plastic compositions, woods, plywood, hardboard, asbestos board, particleboard, ceramics, filled and unfilled plastics, closed-cell rigid foams, or the like. If a cushioning effect is desired, the reinforcing substrate may be comprised of open-cell foam.<br>
The decorative laminate useful in the practice of the present invention may also be obtained by placing the resin impregnated core and decorative sheets between steel coated, steel, or stainless steel plates and subjecting the laminate stack to temperatures ranging between about 150 F to about 500° F and pressures ranging below about 800 to about 1600 psi for a sufficient time to consolidate the laminate and cure the resins. This causes the resin in the paper sheets to flow, cure, and consolidate the sheets into a<br><br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
composite or unitary laminated mass known in the art as a low pressure decorative laminate (LPDL).<br>
In addition, according to one embodiment, the reinforcing substrate of the present invention may be prepared from any suitable extrudable thermoplastic, so long as it has the structural and mechanical properties necessary for the end use desired. In particular, it is preferred that the substrate have a compression set that is approximately the same or better than conventional medium or high density fiberboard or particle board (wherein compression set is measured in accordance with ASTM F970, as thickness decreases as a function of compressive stress). Preferably, this thickness decrease at 2000 psi is at most 0.01 inch, more preferably at most 0.005 inch, and most preferably at most 0.001 inch.<br>
Preferably, the reinforcing substrate useful in the practice of the present invention comprises one or more members selected from the group consisting of rigid urethanes {e.g., RIM foam), poly(acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) (hereafter referred to as ABS) resins such as flame retardant ABS resins and glass filled ABS resins; polycarbonate; high impact polystyrene (HIPS), polystyrene, polyphenylene oxide (PPO), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Preferably, the reinforcing substrate is prepared from a commingled resin system containing, but not limited to, one or more of the above listed polymers. Further, these polymers can be filled or unfilled, although from an impact resistance and physical property standpoint, the filled polymers are best. Preferred fillers include calcium carbonate, talc, silica, glass fibers, alumina and wollastonite, with the more preferred being calcium carbonate and wollastonite, and the most preferred being calcium carbonate. Non-limiting examples of reinforcing agents include inorganic or organic products of high molecular weight, including glass microspheres, glass fibers, asbestos, boron fibers, carbon<br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
and graphite fibers, whiskers, quartz and silica fibers, alumina fibers, fused fiber materials and organic fibers. When such conventional ingredients are utilized, they will generally be present in a range from about 0.01 to about 50 weight percent of the total weight of the reinforcing substrate member, preferably in a range from about 1 to about 25 weight percent of the total weight of the member.<br>
Additional optional layers may be inserted between the core member and the decorative surface member, on the back of the reinforcing substrate member, or on the decorative surface member. It should be understood that backing layers and/or decorative layers may be coextruded with the reinforcing substrate member, or may be applied after the extrusion step by any suitable method.<br>
The panels, according to one embodiment of the present invention, are preferably water repellant and most preferably substantially waterproof. As with conventional flooring panels, the present panels include a decorative layer, a substrate, and a backing layer. The decorative layer and the backing layer are respectively bound to the substrate in a conventional manner to form the present panel. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein the reinforcing substrate material is fiberboard, the backing layer includes, from bottom up, a hydrophobic waterproof layer and three layers of phenol formaldehyde resin impregnated kraft paper. As with the bottom resin impregnated layer of the decorative layer, the top resin impregnated layer of the backing layer is sanded for bonding with the substrate, the hydrophobic waterproof layer may be a DYLARK-like compound. DYLARK is a styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer manufactured by NOVA Chemicals, Inc. DYLARK exhibits outstanding bonding characteristics with the phenolic resin impregnated kraft paper.   The excellent<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
bonding characteristics are thought to be a result of the carboxyl groups found on the maleic anhydride of the DYLARK copolymer. The carboxyl groups bind with the phenolic resin to produce a very stable laminate. Although DYLARK is disclosed as the preferred material for the bottom layer of the backing, other functionally and structurally equivalent polymers may be used without departing from the spirit of the present invention. It is not only desirable to prevent moisture from penetrating the backing layer but also to maintain the original as-manufactured moisture content of the panel to prevent panel warpage.<br>
In addition, although phenol formaldehyde resin impregnated kraft paper is used in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, other resin impregnated papers (or similar materials) may be used without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The resin impregnated layers are maintained in the present backing layer to balance the resin impregnated layers commonly found in decorative layers which may be used in conjunction with the backing layer. That is, the resin impregnated layers in the decorative layer and the backing layer similarly expand and contract as a result of temperature to maintain the substantially flat configuration of the flooring panel. If the resin impregnated layers in the backing layer were not included, the decorative panel would expand and contract at a different rate than the backing layer. This would cause the flooring panel to warp in an undesirable manner. As such, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the phenolic layers may be varied to maintain a balanced relation between the backing and the decorative layers.<br>
As stated,  the  substrate  is  preferably poly(acrylonitrile-c-butadiene-c-styrene) (ABS) foam.    The construction of the backing layer and the substrate results in a<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
waterproof flooring panel which is not susceptible to the harmful environmental conditions commonly found in certain environments. Specifically, the ABS substrate and styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer layer create a moisture barrier which protects the resin impregnated layers from the undesirable effects of moisture.<br>
The above-described flooring panels are manufactured utilizing techniques known in the art. During manufacturing, panels may be machined to form the appropriate recesses in the edges or preferably, may be manufactured wherein at least two edges have recesses formed therein during manufacture of the panel and thus, reduce the amount of material needed to manufacture the panel. In addition, the panel of the present invention, according to one embodiment, may be manufactured utilizing injection molding techniques wherein all edges are formed.<br>
The connector of the present invention includes a number of embodiments. A few of the embodiments are graphically set forth in Figures 1-18. Referring now to Figures 1-18, wherein the same numerals are used to identify the components of a connector of the present invention, as follows: "2" identifies the base of connector 1, "3" identifies a support extending vertically from base 2, "4" identifies a part of a projection extending vertically from base 2 via support 3, "5" identifies another part of a projection extending vertically from base 2 via support 3, "6" identifies a protrusion extending vertically from base 2 of connector 1, "7" identifies another protrusion extending from base 2 of connector 1, "8" identifies a recess in one side of base 2 of connector 1, "9" identifies a recess on another side of base 2 of connector 1, "10" and"11" identify second projections extending from parts 4 and 5 of the first projection which are extending vertically from base 2 via support 3, "12" identifies a recess in between second projections 10 and 11, and "13" and "14" identify recesses located underneath the top<br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
portion of the projection (collectively 3, 4, and 5). Preferably, the system of the present invention comprises a connector having the projection (collectively 3, 4, and 5) and protrusions 6 and 7, and the panels have recesses and channels such that two panels can be disengageably interconnected using the connector in a horizontal and vertical fashion without the use of glue or other adhesives.<br>
It is to be understood that Figures 1-18 are not meant to limit the scope of the invention but are provided to give example embodiments, including the preferred embodiment, of various components of the novel connector of the present invention. Indeed, various combinations of different embodiments of various individual components of the connector can be utilized, i.e., various base 2 configurations illustrated in, e.g., but not limited to, Figures 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. can be utilized with various embodiments of the projection, e.g., but not limited to Figures 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 16, 17, 18, etc., even though the exact combination configuration may not be graphically shown in the figures. Preferably, the connector is less than .240 inches in height.<br>
The connector of the present invention may be manufactured from materials selected from the group consisting of filled and unfilled plastics, rubbers, wood compositions, ceramics, metals, and combinations thereof Preferably, in use with the preferred laminate flooring panels, the connector of the present invention is manufactured from metal or plastic. Depending upon the material and size, the connector may be manufactured using techniques known in the art, e.g., the connector is preferably manufactured from aluminum.<br>
The panels of the present invention include recesses formed therein shaped to receive a connector such that when the panels are connected, the top visible flooring surface only consists of the top wear surface, i.e., preferably, a decorative layer. The connector projections<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
and panel recesses are formed such that when two panels are joined together using a connector of the present invention, the panels are vertically connected together, i.e., if two panels are connected at their edges, the edges of the opposing panels do not move up or down (vertically) relative to each other and thus, provide a level uniform seam between the two. For example, in a preferred embodiment, once connected the panels are engaged against movement relative to each other in the direction of a plane extending vertically from the support surface and perpendicular thereto.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, in addition to vertical connection, the panels and connectors are so shaped to provide a horizontal connection between adjacent panels at their edges, i.e., if two panels are connected at their edges, the edges cannot move any from each other horizontally resulting in a gap between adjacent panels. For example, and according to one embodiment, once connected, the panels are engaged against movement relative to each other in a direction horizontal to the support surface and parallel thereto.<br>
Various non-limiting embodiments of the connector of the present invention have been described and while not shown, the panels of the present invention are necessarily configured, for example, to correspond to these connectors to achieve the advantages of the present invention. It being understood that the panels can be configured to provide an exact fit with the connectors or a non-exact fit, as long as the advantages of the present invention are achieved. For example, where a permanent structure is desired, an embodiment allowing space for glue to accumulate between the panels and the connectors may be appropriate. In addition, when utilizing certain reinforcing substrate materials it might be undesirable for the panels and connectors to fit together exactly, especially when a temporary structure is desired. For example, some space between certain portions of the connector projections and the recesses of<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
the panels can be tolerated as long as the advantages of the invention are achieved, especially a resultant floor having only the top wear surface visible with level uniform seams.<br>
The panels are constructed such that they disengageably interconnect with the connectors of the present invention, i.e., while the connectors and panels are securely connected to perform the function of a flooring surface, the panels can, if desired, be removed by lifting a panel and pulling the panel away from the connector — disengaging the panel/connector interconnection.<br>
The panels of the present invention, according to one embodiment, are constructed such that when connected together utilizing a connector of the present invention, they always form a tight uniform level seam between the panels.   The panels, according to a preferred embodiment, are constructed such that the depth of the recess or channel in the bottom surface of each panel is always a certain distance from the top wear surface.   As stated above, these recesses or channels are shaped to receive a protrusion projecting from the base of a connector (preferably a track) to disengageably interconnect two panels together horizontally.   Thus, at the interconnection point, both panels rest on the connector.   Consequently, even when the support structure or ground floor is uneven or not level, the seam is always tight, uniform and level. Thus, even if the thickness of the panels vary, a uniform level seam is provided when two panels are interconnected because the depth of the recesses or channels in the bottom surface of each panel is formed to be a certain distance from the top wear surface. Therefore, the top wear surfaces of two adjacent panels will always come to rest at the same level, i.e., a certain distance from the base protrusions of the connector.   Preferably, the panels of the present inventive system, range in thickness from about .240 inches to about .320 inches. According to another embodiment, the panels are less than an inch thick.<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
The system of the present invention also provides panels which utilize substantially all of the manufactured laminate top wear surface and thus, provides an economic advantage over many prior art systems. In prior art systems, a panel is manufactured having a top wear surface. After manufacture, the panel is machined at the edges to remove a portion of the top wear surface to form a tongue extension for insertion into a corresponding groove of an adjacent panel. To form the tongue, the top wear surface has to be machined off thus, decreasing the amount of marketable square feet of flooring per panel. In addition, the removal of more top wear surface accelerates tool wear and thus, tools require more maintenance, and/or replacement. Consequently, the cost and time of manufacture increases. Utilizing the system of the present invention, the amount of top wear surface of the panels that needs to be machined to remove any part of the already manufactured and paid for decorative top wear surface is greatly reduced. Substantially all of the manufactured decorative top wear surface is sold to the end user — eliminating waste experienced in prior art systems. As a result, the total square footage of saleable flooring produced by a plant is increased and costs are reduced.<br>
In addition, the connectors of the present invention are not fixed to the panels at the factory and thus, no adhesive or other fastening means is required to be applied — again, reducing material costs, labor costs, and time to manufacture. In a preferred embodiment, the panels are manufactured having all of the necessary recesses formed therein utilizing injection molding techniques. In another preferred embodiment, wherein the middle reinforcing substrate of the panel is extruded, only two edges have to be machined to form recesses therein — the other two edges running in machine direction are formed during extrusion. Both of the above provide additional savings due to the fact that the amount of middle reinforcing substrate<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W752127US<br>
material used is reduced, i.e., never produced.  In prior art systems, the reinforcing substrate material is manufactured and then, a portion is machined away to form a groove.<br>
The system of the present invention also provides panels which are less susceptible to damage than prior art tongue and groove systems. For example, it is known that the tongues of panels are susceptible to damage during shipping, handling, and even assembly and disassembly. If a tongue is broken off or substantially deformed, it will not be able to engage the groove of an adjacent panel and therefore, is rendered useless. The panels of the present invention do not include tongues — they only have recesses or grooves formed therein. It is difficult, if not impossible, to damage a recess or groove during shipping, handling, assembly and disassembly. Thus, the panels of the present invention are more durable than many prior art panels. This is a significant advantage in relation to the use of the panels for "floating floor" surfaces and temporary flooring constructions which will be removed and reassembled many times. The system of the present invention provides connectors (preferably made from metal) which are fairly tough, and easy and economical to replace, when compared to the cost of a new panel. The present inventive systems substantially reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of damaging a panel to the extent that it is inoperable.<br>
The flooring system of the present invention provides a flooring surface which is easy to repair and/or change. For example, many prior art systems, for example, the systems in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,706,621 and 5,860,266 require holding the new panel to be joined at an angle relative to a principal plane of a first laid panel and angling down the new panel to become mechanically locked underneath a portion of the first panel. This is repeated until a floor is constructed. If the fifth panel in a sequence of 20 panels needs to be replaced, e.g., due to damage, panels 6 through 20 have to be removed in reverse order to reach panel 5. Utilizing<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
the system of the present invention, which does not require the angling down of each new panel underneath a portion of an existing panel, panels 1 to 4 of the sequence can be removed and panel 5 replaced. Thus, the present inventive system substantially reduces the time and aggravation of removing and replacing panels. In addition, due to the fact that the panels of the present inventive system do not require a single directional laying sequence, more than one person can construct different portions of a single flooring surface simultaneously for interconnection later. This is especially advantageous in relation to the installation of large flooring surfaces, e.g., retail spaces.<br>
The panels of the present inventive system also provide substantially more aesthetic flexibility than prior art panels. For example, since the panels are not right or left handed, i.e., one or unidirectional, but instead are multidirectional due to each edge being identical, each individual panel can be. placed into a flooring surface being constructed in the most eye-appealing manner. Moreover, the panels of the present inventive systems allow for flexibility in designing and constructing parquet-type flooring surfaces. For example, it is known that a panel is usually manufactured wherein the grain runs in the machine direction; however, since the panels of the present invention are multidirectional, the direction of the grain on the flooring surface can be easily alternated to form a parquet floor, or a floor of any grain design.<br>
The panels of the present inventive system also reduce waste during floor construction. Typically, when constructing a flooring surface using prior art systems with handed panels, the construction starts at one wall and proceeds across the space to the other wall. And, normally, a space to be floored is not of a dimension which is equally divisible by the size of a flooring panel, i.e., panels at an end wall have to be cut length or width wise to fit. In prior art systems utilizing handed panels, once a panel is cut there is a substantial possibility that the remaining<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. W72127US<br>
portion is unusable. For example, in a prior art system utilizing rectangular panels with tongues and grooves on opposing intersecting edges respectively, when a panel is cut lengthwise two panel pieces are formed with one long edge of each either being a tongue or a groove. At the end wall, a portion of a panel may be needed with a groove on the long edge and it is inserted. As a result, only a panel piece having a tongue on the long edge remains without a long groove edge. However, with the panels of the present invention, i.e., each panel is constructed with grooves on all edges, any panel portion remaining after completing the floor up to a portion of the end wall is also possibly useable to complete another portion of the floor up to the end wall. The panels of the present inventive system are constructed such that to assemble two panels together it is not necessary to hold one panel at an angle relative to the other panel and angle down the new panel into place. The fact that the panels can be interconnected by forcing two together while they are lying in the same plane is very advantageous in relation to constructing certain portions of flooring surfaces challenged by various physical boundaries, e.g, the interface between a flooring surface and a fireplace.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, the preferred embodiment of connector 1 of the present invention is comprised of base 2, projection (collectively 3, 4 and 5), and protrusions 6 and 7 spaced apart from and on either side of the projection (collectively 3, 4 and 5) projecting vertically from base 2. Protrusions 6 and 7 are preferably rounded on the top portion as shown, and taper away, i.e., decrease in height as you move away from the center of the base toward the end of said base. Thus, the portion of the protrusions closest to the center of the base and projection (3, 4 and 5) extend the greatest distance vertically. A particularly preferred embodiment of the connector of the present inventive system is shown in Figure 14.   The scale of Figure 14 is 9 times actual size, i.e., 1.000<br><br><br>
