The compounds of formula (I) are deemed novel provided that 5,6-dihydrospiro[imidazo[l,2-b][3]benzazepine-l 1[1 lH],4'-piperidine] and pharmaceuucally acceptable addition salts thereof are not included and thus the present invention also relates to the compounds of formula (I) as defined hereinabove provided that 5,6-dihydrospiro[imidazo[l,2-b][3]benzazepine-l 1[1 lH],4'-piperidine] and pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof are not included.<br>
The term prodrug as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable<br>
derivatives, e.g. esters and amides, such that the resulting biotransformation product of<br>
the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The<br>
reference by Goodman and Gilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8 '<br>
ed., McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, "Biotransformation of Drugs", p. 13-15) describing<br>
prodrugs generally, is hereby incorporated.	<br>
As used herein C1-4alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, 1-methylethyl, butyl and the like; C1-4alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C1-4alky! and pentyl, hexyl, 2-methylpropyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like; C2-6alkenyl as a group or part of a group defines straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals containing one double bond and having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as ethenyl, 2-propenyl, 2-butenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3-pentenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, 3-hexenyl and the like.<br>
As used herein before, the term (=0) forms a carbonyl moiety when attached to a carbon atom and a sulfonyl moiety when attached twice to a sulfur atom. The term (=NOH) forms a hydroxylimine moiety when attached to a carbon atom.<br><br>
The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing and hereinafter, polyhaloC1-4alkyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted C1-4alkyl, in particular methyl with one or more fluoro atoms, for example, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl. In case more than one halogen atoms are attached to an alkyl group within the definition of polyhaloC1-4alkyl, they may be the same or different.<br><br>
When any variable (e.g. R3, R4 etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I), their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts or quaternary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other isomers. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
For therapeutic use, the addition salts of the compounds of.formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are not-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids<br><br>
such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butane-dioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulforiic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br><br>
Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
The term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the compounds of formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
An interesting group of compounds consists of those compounds of formula (I) wherein L is hydrogen, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylcarbonyl, C1-6alkyloxycarbonyl or C1-6alkyl substituted with hydroxy, carboxyl, C1-6alkyloxy or C1-6alkyloxycarbonyl;<br>
Another interesting group of compounds consists of those compounds of formula (I) wherein -A-B- is a bivalent radical of formula -CH=CH-CH=CH- (a-3).<br>

Greene and P. Woyts (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1991). Said deprotcction reaction can be performed by, for example, catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of hydrogen and an appropriate catalyst in a reaction inert solvent. A suitable catalyst in the above reaction is, for example, platinum-on-charcoal, palladium-on-charcoal, and the like. An appropriate reaction-inert solvent for said reaction is, for example, an alcohol, e.g. methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and the like, an ester, e.g. ethylacetate and the like, an acid, e.g. acetic acid and the like.

Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical<br>
methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes are generally racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) which are sufficiently basic or acidic may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequendy separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starring materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospectfically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br><br>
A number of intermediates and starting materials are commercially available or are known compounds which may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art. For example, the preparation of l-(l-phenyl-ethyl)-l//-imidazole is described in WO 92/22551.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms possess useful pharmacological properties. In particular they are active antihistaminic agents, which activity can be demonstrated by for instance the 'Histamine - induced Lethality in Guinea Pigs' test (Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther., 251,39-51,1981), *Protection of Rats from Compound 48/80 -induced Lethality" test (Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther., 234,164-176,1978), and 'Ascaris Allergy in Dogs' test (Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther., 251, 39-51,1981 and Drug Dev. Res., 8, 95-102, 1986).<br>
Some of the intermediates of formula (II-a) also have interesting pharmacological properties.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have a selective binding affinity for the H1 receptor, more in particular, they have a very low affinity for the 5HT2A serotonin receptor and the 5HT2C serotonin receptor. This dissociation between the H1 receptor binding affinity and the 5HT2c and 5HT2A receptor binding affinity renders it unlikely for the present compounds to cause appetite stimulation and inappropriate weight gain reported for some other H1-antagonists.<br>
An important asset of the present compounds is their lack of sedating properties at therapeutic dose levels, a troublesome side effect associated with many antihistaminic and antiallergic compounds. The non-sedating properties of the present compounds can be demonstrated, for example, by the results obtained in studying the sleep -wakefulness cycle of the rat (Psychopharmacology, 97, 436-442, (1989)) and the state of vigilance using EEG power spectra in wake rats (Sleep Research 24A, 118, (1995)).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also characterized by the absence of relevant cardio-hemodynamic and electrophysiological effects such as QTc prolongation.<br>
An additional advantage of some of the present compounds is that they exhibit little or no metabolic transformations in animal and human liver, thus indicating a low risk for metabolic interactions.<br><br>
Another interesting feature of the present compounds relates to their fast onset ot action and the favorable duration of their action. The latter characteristic may enable the administration of the compound once daily.<br>
The present compounds have a favorable physicochemical profile, particularly in terms of solubility and chemical stability.<br>
In view of their physicochemical and pharmacological properties, the compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof are very useful in the treatment of a broad range of allergic diseases such as, for example, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, chronic urticaria, pruritis, allergic asthma and the like.<br>
Also in view of their useful physicochemical and pharmacological properties the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the antiallergic compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are, desirably as unitary dosage forms, administered orally, parenterally, percutaneously, rectally or topically for systemic action, or for topical action. In case of oral liquid pharmaceutical preparations, comprising solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs and emulsions, any of the usual pharmaceutical media, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like, may be employed, whereas in case of oral solid pharmaceutical preparations, comprising powders, pills, capsules and tablets, excipients such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like may be employed. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral unit dosage forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. In case of injectable pharmaceutical compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, such as semipolair solvents, may be included, for example, to aid solubility. Examples of carriers for injectable solutions comprise saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing compounds of the aforementioned formulas may also be formulated in an oil for prolonged action. Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, com oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain<br><br><br>
fatty acids and mixtures of these and other oils. For the preparation of injectable suspensions, appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, oprionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment or as a gel. In case of pharmaceutical compositions for rectal administration, any of the usual excipients may be employed, comprising fat based and water soluble excipients, optionally combined with suitable additives, such as suspending or wetting agents. As appropriate compositions for topical application there may be cited all compositions usually employed for topically administering drugs e.g. creams, gellies, dressings, lotions, shampoos, tinctures, pastes, ointments, salves, ovules, powders, inhalations, nose sprays, eye drops and the like. Semisolid compositions such as salves, creams, gellies, ointments and the like will conveniently be used, but application of said compositions may be, for example, also by aerosol, e.g. with a propellent such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, a freon, or without a propellent such as a pump spray or drops.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required phannaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, suppositories, ovules, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from allergic diseases by administering to said warm-blooded animals an effective anti-allergic amount of a compound of formula (I), a prodrug, //-oxide, addition salt, quaternary amine or stereochemically isomeric form thereof.<br>
The present invention further relates to the compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms<br><br>
thereof for use as a medicine, and hence, the use of the present compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treating warm-blooded animals suffering from allergic diseases is also part of the present invention.<br>
In general it is contemplated that an effective antiallergic amount would be from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg body weight, and more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight. In any event, an effective antiallergic amount may depend on the type and severity of the affliction to be treated and the evaluation of the physician prescribing the treatment with the subject drugs.<br>
