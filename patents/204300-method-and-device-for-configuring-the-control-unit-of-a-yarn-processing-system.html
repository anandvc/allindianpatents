METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CONFIGURING THE CONTROL UNIT OF A<br>
YARN PROCESSING SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a device as disclosed in the preamble of claim 1 and to a method as disclosed in the preamble of claim 20.<br>
WO 99/14643 A discloses a device for addressing yam feeding devices during the initialisation phase of the yarn processing system within the communication bus system via a uni-directional line loop extending to and from the main control unit of the weaving machine.   The addressing is carried out by the main control unit.   Within the line loop a switch is provided in each yarn feeding device.   The switch is closed by the feeding unit control in response to a command transferred in the bus system and as soon as an addressing diagram has been transmitted from the main control unit in the line loop and has been verified.   The switches are closed consecutively until each yarn feeding unit has received an individual address in the communication bus system.   This requires considerable cabling.   Furthermore, the main control unit which has already to fulfil a plurality of other high class tasks has to be expanded additively for the addressing process.<br>
Furthermore, it is known in practice for yarn processing systems to address the yarn feeding units with necessary node addresses with the help of analogous voltage signals. As a defined voltage range is needed for each analogous voltage signal, while the entire available voltage range is limited for system reasons, the number of addresses can only be relatively small.   This is a drawback for systems containing a significant number of yarn feeding units.   Furthermore, a sophisticated voltage dividing circuitry is needed.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a device and a method as disclosed above allowing for fair costs and with reduced cabling to reliably address even a large number of yarn feeding units and such that the yarn processing system at any time can be expanded by further yam feeding units or can be downsized or such that yarn feeding units can change positions in the system without problems.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of claim 1 and the features of method claim 19.<br><br>
The interface, which is common for all yarn feeding units, can be structured simply and for fair costs with the at least code generator.  The interface can be arranged at a position to which the cabling remains low.   Particularly expedient a fair cost and simple code generator can be used only for the addressing task.  This code generator has a maximum large number of outputs such that the addressing device is compact and reliable.   One data line is provided for addressing each yarn feeding unit, which data line e.g. may be contained in the connecting cable of the yarn feeding unit.   This allows to significantly simplify the cabling.   Furthermore, that data line advantageously also can be used for transmitting other signals, e.g. status signals of the yarn feeding unit and/or functional signals to connected function members, as soon as the addressing operation is over and/or if the respective yarn feeding unit is operating in a stand alone mode, because the data line does not have any active function during the normal operation of the yarn processing system, i.e. after the initialisation phase.  A considerable advantage of the code generator is the capability to address without problems an almost unlimited number of yarn feeding units by means of a respective serial code which is generated in pulsed form, and because the individual serial codes can be discriminated from each other by their information content although they are built up basically equally.   Expediently, the interface with the generator is so to speak a component of a yarn feeding unit package, i.e. independent from control assemblies and communication assemblies for higher ranking tasks, provided that the interface is designed compatible to the control and communication assemblies.<br>
Expediently a serial code is generated at each output by the code generator which is employed for the addressing only.   The serial code also contains communication protocol information in addition to the individual node address information in order to be apt to communicate with the respective selected protocol.   In this case, the yarn feeding unit does not need to be adjusted prior to the installation of the respective protocol.   In case of a change of the protocol no changes have to be carried out at the yarn feeding unit.<br>
Since there are different types of yarn feeding units or different modii of operation of yarn feeding units in yarn processing systems, the respective control unit of the yarn feeding unit expediently comprises a microcontroller and a bi-directional l/O-circuitry which is connected to the data line and which is held either in a reading status or in a reading/sending status for a communication or which can be switched into a sending status by the microcontroller in response to the information content of the serial code.  When the yarn feeding unit is<br><br>
operating after the initialisation phase in a stand alone mode such that it only has to give status signals to the textile machine, e.g. a yarn breakage signal to which the textile machine has to react by a switching off action or by switching action in another yarn feeding unit, the data line which per se is provided for the addressing is used in the sending status to transmit such status signals, e.g. via the interface, to the textile machine.   This saves a separate signal line from each yarn feeding unit to the textile machine.   However, if the yarn feeding unit operates in a communicate mode, then the l/O-circuitry may be held in a reading status.   If necessary, the status signal can then be transmitted in the form of a message in the bus system.   As long as the l/O-circuitry is held for communication and addressing in the reading/sending status, generally status signals can be transmitted to the textile machine after the initialisation phase via the data lines and further via single signal lines.<br>
During the addressing the yarn feeding unit automatically prepares for the respective operation mode, e.g. the stand alone operation mode, by automatically switching from the reading status into the sending status and maintaining the sending status if during the initialisation phase non-readable information should occur or if no serial information was received.   For the switching into the sending status, e.g. start indicators or end indicators of the serial codes may be used.<br>
Particularly expediently the interface with the code generator is arranged in a power supply box of the yarn feeding units which is structurally separated from the textile machine, because the yarn feeding units anyhow have to be connected to the power supply box e.g. for the power supply or for the integration into the bus system.   This measure saves cabling and separates the addressing device from the higher qualified components.   It is, however, to be noted that the interface with the addressing code generator instead may be placed in the weaving machine or in the main control unit e.g. if also the power supply box of the yarn feeding units is placed there.   Expediently, the interface with the addressing code generator, however, is placed where the cabling can be minimal.   The package consisting of the yam feeding units, the power supply box, and the addressing device, i.e. a standardised yarn feeding unit platform, can be prefabricated and can be combined without problems with different types of textile machine and/or communication systems due to the universal design.<br><br>
A communication interface circuit board of a first type may be provided at the interface. The circuit board is also connected to the communication bus system which in turn is connected to the main control unit of the textile machine.   So to speak, then the single nodes for the yarn feeding units are placed in the interface.<br>
Alternatively, a second type of an interface circuit board for a stand alone mode may be provided at the interface.   This means that the connected yarn feeding unit does not communicate with the textile machine which is operating separately from the bus system but is in some cases integrated into a bus system connecting some or all of the yarn feeding units and in some cases even peripheral components.  This second type of the interface circuit board should have a functionality as is common for a communication from a textile machine.<br>
Alternatively, a third type of an interface circuit board for a stand alone mode may be provided at the interface.   The data line used for the addressing is used during normal operation, e.g. for transmitting the status signals of the yarn feeding unit via a signal line which extends from the interface to the main control unit.<br>
In order to simplify the configuration of the control unit the interface expediently includes a universal circuit board which selectively allows to be configured as the first, the second or the third type, particularly and preferably in view of the type of yarn feeding unit as used or the type of textile machine or the mode of operation of the yarn feeding unit respectively.<br>
Each data line for addressing or for adjusting the mode of operation of the yarn feeding unit during e.g. an initialisation phase advantageously can be used during the normal operation not only for the transmission of status signals to the textile machine, for which purpose the data line e.g. is connected via the interface to a common signal line, but the data line may be extended further to a functional member, e.g. within or at the power supply box of the yarn feeding units.   By this configuration of the data lines, in some cases one data line may be sufficient per functional member.   Each desired functional signal can be transmitted with a rapid and accurate timing from at least one feeding unit or from the textile machine via the at least one yarn feeding unit.   Such functional members normally may be control units which in some cases even may be addressed within the bus system, and which are provided for low or medium requirements, like at least one valve drive for a pneumatic valve<br><br>
for cleaning purposes.   This additional function of the yarn processing system may be handled, if necessary, thanks to the configuration of the data line during the normal operation and without additional cabling.<br>
In order to carry out the addressing by the interface autonomically the code generator should be provided with a system clock, a protocol selector and a basis address selector. The system clock defines the internal timing of the addressing device during the addressing process.  The serial code then can be repeated either for a certain number of times at each output, e.g. during the initialisation phase, or can be cycled permanently.   The protocol selector, if provided, defines the respective communication protocol information which is to be transmitted to the yarn feeding unit or selects the respectively used protocol.   The yarn feeding units connected to the code generator expediently will receive the same protocol information.   The basis address selector defines a basis address for the code generator with the help of which address the code generator generates the individual node address information.   The protocol selector and the basis address selector expediently are formed by a DIP-switch or by several, respectively set jumper switches.   In case of several code generators switched in series the protocol selector may be a common selector switch.<br>
In the case that the number of the yarn feeding units which are to be connected is so large that it cannot be covered by a single code generator, several code generators could be provided which are switched in series at the interface, for a selective expansion of the system.    Each of the code generators provided may have its own basis address selector such that the basis addresses of the different code generators are different from each other.<br>
In case of several code generators switched in series alternatively a generator located downstream may be connected to an output of the generator located upstream and may use this output as its basis address selector (cascade circuit).   This may mean that the code generator located downstream uses the same basis address as the generator located upstream or that the generator located downstream derives its own, other basis address by an internal program routine from the basis address of the generator located upstream.<br>
The interface, primarily provided for the addressing, advantageously may be integrated into the bus system and into the power supply system, provided that the circuit board<br><br>
additionally has at least one communication interface or a power supply interface.   By this measure the cabling can be minimised.<br>
The outputs expediently may be formed by yarn feeding unit terminal connectors for a respective connection cable or for a terminal connector of a connection cable, respectively. The connection cable contains that data line as one addressing conductor.   By interconnecting the connectors each yarn feeding unit automatically is connected as well for the addressing and for the communication or for the power supply.   This significantly simplifies the cabling.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the code generator basically may be provided with an additional input for a serial code and/or an output for a serial expansion code, for the case that more than one code generator is needed at the interface, and provided that these code generators are to be functionally interlinked.<br>
In this way and in the case of code generators switched in series each generator located downstream may be connected with its code input to the serial expansion code output of the generator located upstream in order to derive its basis address and, in some cases, to overwrite the pre-set basis address information or even the communication protocol information by means of the transmitted serial expansion code.   In this case identical and equally configured generators can be used which nevertheless send out different information.<br>
In another alternative of code generators switched in series the code input of a generator located downstream will be connected to an output of the generator located upstream which output is not connected to a yarn feeding unit.   In this way the basis address of the generator located upstream can be read.   Furthermore, the internal communication protocol information adjustments and/or the basis address information adjustment of the generator located downstream can be overwritten and adapted by means of the individual information as transmitted from the generator located upstream.<br>
The serial code generated and transmitted for addressing and in some cases also for a selection of the communication protocol, expediently is sub-divided into several data segments.   In an expedient data format a start indicator having the form of at least one low<br><br>
start bit may start a serial word.   The serial word contains at least one binary data segment consisting of a plurality of bits.   In the serial word, expediently, one data segment contains the respective node address information and one further data segment contains the communication protocol information for the respective node.   The serial word is terminated by an end indicator which may contain one bit or several bits in an inverted status of the start bit.   By this construction of the serial code clearly readable and very viable information can be transmitted.   The yarn feeding unit thus can be alerted that subsequent addressing will be carried out.<br>
According to the method the generated and transmitted serial code is sampled several times upon receipt in the yarn feeding unit in order to improve the operational addressing safety.   The node address information and/or the communication protocol information only is verified and accepted after several equal samples of the correct serial code have been detected.   This measure reduces the danger than noise influences and other disturbances could result in an erroneous addressing.  The configured serial code signal thus is accepted first when it has been recognised as being stable.<br>

processing system.<br>
A yarn processing system S shown in Fig. 1 comprises e.g. a textile machine T having a computerised main control unit MCU and several yam feeding units F1 to F6 operatively associated to the textile machine T.   The textile machine T consumes yarns from the yarn feeding units in different yarn channels and processes the yarns.  The textile machine T, typically, is a weaving machine.   The yarn feeding units F1 to F6 are weft yarn feeding devices.  Alternatively, the textile machine e.g. could be a knitting machine including several knitting systems to which the yarn feeding units F1 to F6 each alone or in groups feed knitting yarns.<br>
The yarn feeding units F1 to F6 are connected via single connection cables L to at least one common power supply box PSB which is connected to the main power supply P. Furthermore, a communication bus system BS is provided into which the main control unit MCU and the yarn feeding units F1 to F6 are incorporated.   A bus conductor BL connects the main control unit MCU with the power supply box PSB.   Alternatively, the bus system could directly lead to the yarn feeding units.   The yarn feeding units F1 and F6 can be switched on and off by a switch SW.   However, it is possible to provide single switches at the yarn feeding units or a main switch for the entire yarn processing system, e.g. also in order to initiate an initialisation phase.<br>
Inside of the power supply box PSB an interface IF is provided which e.g. contains an interface circuit board PCB to which at least one code generator SCG (processing circuitry or logic circuitry) is associated for generating a serial pulse code.   The interface IF or the circuit board PCB can be connected to the power supply P, the bus system BS and, in some cases, even the switch SW.  A single data line DL is contained in each connection<br><br>
cable L.   The data line DL connects a control unit CU of the yarn feeding unit F1 to F6 with the interface IF, expediently via connectors CU (push connectors) at outputs E1 to E6 of the interface IF.   The outputs E1 to E6 may be positioned at an outer wall of the power supply box PSB.   Each output E1 to E6 e.g. is associated to a predetermined yarn channel of the weaving machine.<br>
The yarn feeding units F1 to F6 may operate according to different operation modes.  A first type is a yarn feeding unit which communicates with the textile machine T in the bus system BS, e.g. a weft yarn feeding device for a jet weaving machine.   Another yarn feeding unit type is provided to operate in a stand alone mode without communication with the textile machine, but, in some cases, with a communication in a bus system BS in which the yarn feeding units are incorporated but not the textile machine (Fig. 2).   Another yarn feeding unit type operates completely autonomically in stand alone mode without participating in any communication.<br>
In the yarn processing system as shown in Fig. 2 a communication bus system BS is provided into which e.g. the yam feeding units F1, F4 are integrated but not the textile machine T.   Between the interface IF and the main control unit MCU a signal line SL is provided in order to transfer status signals of the yam feeding units to the textile machine, e.g. a yarn breakage signal or a stop signal or the like during operation of the system.   This signal is transmitted via the data line DL to the interface IF and from the interface IF via the signal line SL to the main control unit MCU.<br>
At least three different types of circuit boards PCB may be used in practice.   This means that either the respective expedient circuit board type is inserted at the interface IF or that a universal circuit board is provided which will be configured accordingly in adaptation to the respective situation.<br>
The first type of an interface circuit board PCB is provided for yarn feeding units which do not communicate with a textile machine, e.g. the weaving machine.   However, status signals of the yarn feeding units can be transmitted to the textile machine, either as separate signals from each yarn feeding unit to the textile machine (not shown) or via the signal line SL (Fig. 2).<br><br>
The second type of the circuit board PCB serves for yarn feeding units equipped for communication with a textile machine.   The yarn feeding units are connected to the common bus system, particularly via nodes having determined addresses.   Status signals then may be transmitted in the bus system in the form of messages.   It is also possible to transmit the status signals separately on a signal line and the data lines.<br>
The third type is an interface circuit board PCB for yarn feeding units which do not communicate with a textile machine but which communicate among one another in their own local bus system.   In this case the interface circuit board PCB should have a major part of the functionality which normally is given by the textile machine itself.<br>
The code generator SCG provided at the interface IF may either be a pure digital logic circuitry using a FPGA, or may be a simple microcontroller or microprocessor having a plurality of connection points or pins.   The code generator is designed to repeat serial codes for a predetermined number of repetitions or to repeat them permanently in cycles, at least during an initialisation phase of the system.<br>
The control unit CU of each yarn feeding unit F1 to F6 contains a not shown microcontroller or microprocessor and, expediently, a bi-directional I/O circuitry which I/O circuitry can be switched by the microcontroller of the control unit CU between a reading status or a reading and sending status and a pure sending status, and in particular, expediently, by response of the microcontroller to the serial code which is transmitted from the interface IF during addressing, or by responding to the fact that no serial code has been transmitted, respectively.   In the case that the yarn feeding unit is designed to communicate via the bus system, the microcontroller reads the information content of the serial code, accepts the appointed node address and the communication protocol selection, and then is maintaining the I/O circuitry in the reading status or the reading and sending status, respectively (also even for, in some cases, the transmission of status signals into the data line DL).   In the case that the connected microcontroller of one yarn feeding unit does not receive any serial message or receives a serial message via the data line DL which cannot be understood, automatically a stand alone operation mode is accepted by this yarn feeding unit.   The microcontroller switches the I/O circuitry into the sending status in order to be able to transmit later status signals via the data line DL.<br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the data format of the serial code SC having a start indicator A conventionally formed by at least one "low" bit for serial communication systems.   The start indicator indicates that a serial word will follow.   Thereafter a binary data segment B follows and, in case that also a communication protocol information is transmitted, a binary data segment C.   Each data segment B and C is built of a number of bits which is determined for the specific system.   The data segments contain information of the node address and the communication protocol information.  At the end of a serial code SC as a further segment an end indicator D is transmitted which is formed by one or several bits which are transmitted in the inverted status of the start bit.   The respectively employed software algorithm is part of the controller software equipment.<br>
In the following two different initialisation sequences will be explained.<br>
The yarn feeding unit is brought into an initialisation status upon switching on the supply power.   The bi-directional I/O controller circuitry serves in the initialisation status first only as an input.   During the initialisation phase the yarn feeding unit reads incoming pulses.   In the case that prior to the end of the initialisation process, e.g. up to the receipt of the data segment D (end indicator), no valid pulse signal could be detected, the yarn feeding unit automatically accepts a stand alone operation mode.   This means that the bi-directional I/O circuitry will then be set as an output, e.g. for status signals.   Later, e.g. during normal operation of the system, the yarn feeding unit will send the respective status signal corresponding to the respective status like yarn breakage, overheating, stalling of the drive motor, etc. on the data line DL.<br>
A yarn feeding unit participating in a communication enters its initialisation status after being switched on.   During the initialisation phase the yarn feeding unit monitors the receipt of pulses.   As soon as a valid pulse signal is detected prior to the data segment D (end indicator), i.e. that a correct node address and a supported communication protocol have been received, the yarn feeding unit automatically enters the communication operation mode.   In the communication operation mode the bi-directional I/O circuitry is maintained as an input or as an input and output, respectively.   As soon as a valid signal has been detected and accepted as intended further incoming signals either may be refused or evaluated from time to time.   In order to minimise the influence of noise or electrical noise and the like the serial code is sampled several times.   The yarn feeding unit only enters<br><br>
communication status if the configuring serial code has been determined as being stable, i.e. if e.g. several equal samples could be detected.   Later, the data line DL can e.g. be used for sending status signals to the textile machine.<br>
In Fig. 4 the design of the code generator SCG is illustrated and also the procedure of addressing the yarn feeding units which are connected to the outputs E1 to En.   At the input side of the code generator (which is a microprocessor or a digital logic circuitry) a protocol selector PS is connected to define the respective communication protocol. Furthermore, a basis address selector BAS for the basis address of the code generator SCG is connected to define the basis address on the basis of which the code generator generates individual node addresses.   Furthermore, an input SCI for a serial code is connected, and finally a clock C for internally timing the code generator.   At the output E1 for e.g. the first yarn feeding unit the code generator generates e.g. a serial code using the basis address plus the address number 1.   In this way at each output another serial code is generated, and finally at the output En the serial code out of the basis address plus the node address number "n".  Additionally, at each output the serial code can be generated together with information of the selected communication protocol.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the design of the interface IF with the circuitry board PCB.   The outputs E1 to E6 e.g. are formed as connector parts CO and are connected here to the single code generator SCG.   At the input side of the code generator SCG the mentioned basis address selector BAS in the form of a basis configuration BC and the protocol selector PS in the form of a protocol configuration PC are connected.   Optionally, furthermore, an input SCI for a serial code "0" may be provided.   Optionally, furthermore, an output EO for a serial expansion code "7" may be provided for the case that more than one code generator SCG should be needed for the interface IF.   Finally, an interface BIF for the communication bus system and/or an interface PIF for the power supply could be provided at the circuit board PCB.<br>
In Fig. 6 there are at least two code generators SCG provided at the interface IF which code generators SCG are switched in series in order to allow to connect a larger number of yarn feeding units, particularly at the outputs E1 to E12.   The code generators SCG are interconnected via the bus line BL of the bus system.   Each code generator SCG has its own basis address selector BAS.   The generator situated in Fig. 6 on the left side has the<br><br>
basis address "0", while the generator on the right side has the basis address "1".   By this switching order totally 12 outputs E1 to E12 can be used for yarn feeding units in order to connect them for a communication and/or for addressing or to set the respective mode. The basis address for each code generator is selected by its internal switching configuration.   For both code generators the internal protocol selector is set into the same position,<br>
In Fig. 7 at least two code generators SCG are switched in series in order to allow to use totally twelve outputs E1 to E12.   The code generator SCG on the left side has the basis address selector BAS for the basis address "0".  The code generator SCG on the right side has one input SCI, connected to several output EO of the other code generator to obtain the serial expansion code "7" there.  The basis address of the first code generator SCG is selected by its internal circuitry configuration.   The second code generator SCG detects the presence and the basis address of the left side code generator and overwrites its own internal adjustment or setting with respect to the basis address and the protocol information by the serial expansion code "7".   The communication bus system then is completed by a continuous bus cable which has not been shown in detail.<br>
In Fig. 8 also at least two code generators SCG are switched in series such that in this case eleven outputs E1 to E5 and E7 to E12 can be used.   The input SCI of the right side code generator SCG is connected to an output E6 of the left side code generator, which output E6 is not used for connecting a yarn feeding unit, e.g. to the last exit E6 in order to read the information provided in output E6.   By this switching principle no additional connection strand is needed, however, then the output or exit E6 cannot be used for a yarn feeding unit.   The bus line BL continues via the code generators.<br>
The yarn processing system S schematically shown in Fig. 9 consists of the textile machine T, e.g. a weaving machine, of at least one yarn feeding unit F1, and of a power supply box PSB.    At or in the power supply box PSB a functional member VD is provided to which a data line DL extends from the interface IF and the code generator SCG (which may be a processor or a logic circuitry).   For example, one functional component like a pneumatic valve V intended for cleaning purposes in the yarn processing system S is connected to the functional member VD.   There may be several functional members VD side by side (as indicated in dotted lines).   Functional signals can be transmitted to the functional member<br><br>
VD via the data line DL and the interface IF, and, in particular, during the normal operation of the yarn processing system, i.e. expediently after termination of the initialisation phase which serves to address and to select the communication protocol.<br>
The textile machine is connected via the main bus system BS and the bus line BL (e.g. a CAN-bus system) with a CAN distributor CD in the power supply box PSB.   In this case a CAN processor CP is contained in one microprocessor MP of the main control unit MCU of the textile machine.  A textile machine display MD and a keyboard KB are connected to the microprocessor MP.   A bus line BL leads from the power supply box PSB to a feeding unit communication processor FP of the yarn feeding unit control unit CU of the yarn feeding unit F1.   A yarn feeding unit status sensor SS may be provided and connected to the yarn feeding unit control unit CU.   The yarn feeding unit status sensor SS generates and delivers status signals.   The yarn feeding unit control unit CU, furthermore, is connected via the data line DL to the interface IF and via the extended data line DL also to the functional member VD.   A communication with the code generator SCG and/or the interface IF is possible via the communication distributor CD, e.g. in order to also give signals to the functional member VD either via the yarn feeding unit control unit CU or directly.<br>
As soon as after the initialisation phase the yarn feeding unit F1 has received its address by a serial message the yarn feeding unit maintains its address or the set operation mode until it is switched off again.   For this reason the data line which has been used for the addressing may be used during normal operation of the yarn processing system for other purposes.   The addressing can be carried out by a microprocessor (code generator address SCG) in the power supply PSB.   This results in a factual serial communication system.   The communication may either be a regular master/slave communication protocol or even a LIN protocol or another customised protocol.   In the simplest case the system also functions without any microprocessor by decoding a pulse chain by logic circuitries.<br>
In case that there are processors provided anyhow, the costs for the additional function of the pneumatic valve V are extremely low.   This additional function in the normal case is carried out by a control device which fulfils medium to low requirements, however, needs a rapid and precise timing.<br><br>
In the shown embodiment the yarn feeding unit microprocessor FB e.g. is used in order to control the functional member VD which is placed in or at the power supply box PSB.   The functional component may be the pneumatic valve V which is activated for cleaning purposes and may be controlled by only one or by several of the yarn feeding units.<br>
By means of the keyboard KB of the textile machine the respective cleaning interval and its time duration are set by the operator and are visualised on the machine display MD. These functional parameters are transmitted via the bus system BS.   For the timing and/or for synchronisation in some cases the rotational angle position value of the main shaft of the textile machine can be considered as well.   The yarn feeding unit microprocessor FB is apt to carry out the CAN communication as well as normal serial communication for the addressing.   Commands to the pneumatic valve V are sent from the yarn feeding unit microprocessor FP to the functional member VD, i.e. to the valve drive, and to the code generator SCG in the power supply box PSB (which is also a processor).   This processor then sends a control signal (on and off) to the functional member VD.   Status signals originating from the status sensor SS may either be transmitted from the control unit CU into the bus line BL or via the data line DL and the code generator SCG to the communication distributor CD and from the communication distributor CD to the main control unit MCU.<br>
The functional members VD could also be addressed in order to function as nodes in the main bus system BS.   In this fashion several identical or different functional members could be controlled precisely.<br><br><br><br>
