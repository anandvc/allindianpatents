				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a white multi-wavelength light<br>
emitting diode (LED), and more particularly to a light emitting diode that<br>
emits light of correct color and effectively promotes the performance of<br>
luminance, and a manufacturing process of the LED.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art:<br>
Usually a light emitting diode is comprised of having a packaging<br>
material (non-conductive material) to wrap up a light emitting integrated<br>
circuit (IC), and a golden wire to connect IC electrodes to the circuit so<br>
that once the IC is conducted, it emits the light to outwardly irradiate<br>
through the packaging material, and the light emitted from the chip is<br>
further incorporated with the wavelength of a non-conductive material in<br>
the packaging material to emit the light in an expected color.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings of the<br>
present invention, a while LED construction of the prior art has a bowl<br>
shaped carrier 10 to secure a blue light emitting chip 21 and<br><br>
accommodate a packaging material 30, an encapsulating material 40 is<br>
coated at where between the blue light emitting chip 21 and the carrier<br>
(or a similar substrate) to secure the chip 21. In practice, the light<br>
emitted from the chip 21 is incorporated with the wavelength of a yellow<br>
phosphor 51 in the packaging material 30 to produce white light; or<br>
alternatively as illustrated in Fig. 2, the light emitted from the chip 21 is<br>
incorporated with the wavelength of a red phosphor 52 and that of a<br>
green phosphor 53 to produce white light. Furthermore, in another<br>
prior art yet, the encapsulating material is used to secure a blue light<br>
emitting chip in a carrier while gold plated wire is used to connect<br>
between the chip and electrodes so that once the chip is conducted, the<br>
phosphor is excited by the light from the blue light emitting chip to<br>
produce the light in a color as desired.<br>
Therefore, to produce white light from the white LED, it takes to<br>
allow the light emitting chip in a given color to be incorporated with the<br>
wavelength of a phosphor in a color corresponding to that of the chip.<br>
However, the construction of a white LED illustrated in Fig. 1 of having<br>
an encapsulating material 40 directly embedded at the bottom of a blue<br>
light emitting chip 21, the light travel or the extent of the phosphor is<br>
excited may vary depending on the level of the encapsulating material<br><br>
40 is embedded, thus to compromise the luminance and color<br>
performance of the entire LED.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a white<br>
multi-wavelength LED to produce the expected white light and<br>
effectively promote luminance performance. To achieve the purpose, a<br>
die unit for a white multi-wavelength LED is comprised of having at the<br>
bottom of a light emitting chip in a given color bonded with a first<br>
non-conductive material containing phosphor in a color corresponding to<br>
that of the chip. The first non-conductive material functions as the<br>
position to coat the encapsulating material to secure the die unit to the<br>
carrier. Golden plated wire is used as circuit connection for the light<br>
emitting chip, and finally, a second non-conductive material containing<br>
phosphor in a color corresponding to that of the chip is injected to cover<br>
up the light emitting chip to allow the light from the chip to pass through<br>
both of the first and the second non-conductive materials and to be<br>
incorporated with the wavelength of the phosphor respectively<br>
contained in both of the first and the second non-conductive materials.<br>
In practice, a blue light emitting chip is used for the entire white<br>
multi-wavelength LED. A red phosphor is mixed in the first<br><br>
non-conductive material, and a green phosphor is mixed in the second<br>
non-conductive material; or alternatively, an approximate ultraviolet light<br>
emitting chip is used, and a red phosphor is mixed in the first<br>
non-conductive material, and a green phosphor and a blue phosphor<br>
are mixed in the second non-conductive material.<br>
A reflection material may be further disposed at the bottom of the<br>
first non-conductive material to help promote the luminance<br>
performance of the LED.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is essentially having fixed at the bottom of a light emitting chip<br>
20 in a given color a first non-conductive material 61 containing a<br>
phosphor 50 in a color corresponding to that of the chip 20. The first<br>
non-conductive material 61 is bonded to the bottom of the chip 20 either<br>
by the spin coating or baking solidification method to form a die unit for<br>
the manufacturing of a white multi-wavelength LED of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Accordingly, the first non-conductive material serves as the<br>
position for coating an encapsulating material to secure the die unit onto<br>
a carrier. A golden plated wire connects the circuit of the light emitting<br>
chip 20 and finally a second no-conductive material containing a<br>
phosphor in a color corresponding to that of the chip 20 is injected to<br>
cover up the top of the chip 20 to allow light from the chip 20 to pass<br><br>
through both of the first and the second non-conductive materials to be<br>
incorporated with the wavelength respectively from both of the first and<br>
the second no-conductive materials for producing the expected white<br>
light and effectively promoting the luminance performance of the white<br>
multi-wavelength LED.<br>
In practice, the white multi-length of the present invention is made<br>
in a first type of construction as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, or in a<br>
second type of construction as illustrated in Fig. 6. In the first type of<br>
construction, a layer of the first non-conductive material containing a red<br>
phosphor 52 is bonded at the bottom of a blue light emitting chip 21 to<br>
form a die unit for the manufacturing of the white multi-wavelength LED.<br>
The first non-conductive material 61 serves as the position to coat<br>
an encapsulating material 40 to secure the die unit onto a carrier 10<br>
while a golden plated wire 70 constitutes the circuit connection for the<br>
blue light emitting chip 21. Finally, a second non-conductive material<br>
62 containing a green phosphor 53 is injected to cover up the top of the<br>
blue light emitting chip 21.<br>
Furthermore, in a second preferred embodiment of the first type of<br>
construction as illustrated in Fig. 5, the first non-conductive material 61<br>
containing the red phosphor 52 is bonded to the bottom of an<br><br>
approximate ultraviolet light emitting chip 22 to form a die unit for the<br>
manufacturing of the white multi-wavelength LED. With the first<br>
non-conductive material 61 as the position to coat the encapsulating<br>
material 40, the die unit is secured onto the carrier 10 while the golden<br>
plated wire constitutes the circuit connection for the approximate<br>
ultraviolet light emitting chip 22. Finally, a second non-conductive<br>
material 62 containing green phosphor 53 and blue phosphor is injected<br>
to cover up the top of the approximate ultraviolet light emitting chip 22.<br>
Accordingly, a manufacturing process as illustrated in Fig. 8 for<br>
the manufacturing the white multi-wavelength LED in the first type of<br>
construction includes but not limited to the following steps:<br>
a.	Prepare a light emitting chip in a given color;<br>
b.	A die unit is prepared by having a first non-conductive<br>
material containing phosphor in a color corresponding to<br>
that of the light emitting chip bonded to the bottom of the<br>
light emitting chip;<br>
c.	Bond the die unit to a carrier with an encapsulating<br>
material;<br>
d.	Inject a second non-conductive material containing<br>
phosphor in a color corresponding to that of the light<br><br>
emitting chip into the carrier to cover up the light emitting<br>
chip;<br>
e.	Finish with the baking process.<br>
Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 6 for the second type of<br>
construction of the white multi-wavelength LED, the first non-conductive<br>
material 61 containing red phosphor 52 is bonded to the bottom of the<br>
blue light emitting chip 21 and the second non-conductive material<br>
containing green phosphor 53 is bonded to the top of the blue light<br>
emitting chip 21 to form a die unit for the manufacturing of the white<br>
multi-wavelength LED. With the first non-conductive material 61 as the<br>
position for the coating of the encapsulating material 40, the die unit is<br>
secured onto the carrier while the golden plated wire 70 constitutes the<br>
circuit connection for the blue light emitting chip 21.<br>
Accordingly, a manufacturing process as illustrated in Fig. 9 for<br>
the manufacturing the white multi-wavelength LED in the second type of<br>
construction illustrated in Fig. 6 includes but not limited to the following<br>
steps:<br>
a.	Prepare a light emitting chip in a given color;<br>
b.	A die unit is prepared by having a first non-conductive<br>
material containing phosphor in a color corresponding to that<br><br>
of the light emitting chip bonded to the bottom of the light<br>
emitting chip, a second non-conductive material containing<br>
phosphor in a color corresponding to that of the light emitting<br>
chip bonded to the top of the light emitting chip;<br>
c.	Bond the die unit to a carrier with an encapsulating material;<br>
and<br>
d.	Finish with the baking process.<br>
In either type of construction, the white multi-wavelength LED of<br>
the present invention entirely prevents the light emitting chip from being<br>
screened by the encapsulating material to permit the light from the light<br>
emitting chip to pass through both of the first and the second<br>
non-conductive materials without barriers and to be incorporated with<br>
the wavelength respectively from both of the first and the second<br>
non-conductive materials thus to produce the expected white light while<br>
effectively promoting the luminance performance. As illustrated in Fig. 7,<br>
a reflective material 80 is disposed at the bottom of the first<br>
non-conductive material 61 to help promote the luminance performance<br>
of the LED.<br>
The prevent invention provides a white multi-wavelength LED<br>
structure and its related manufacturing process that generates correct<br><br>
white light color and effectively promotes luminance performance, and<br>
the application for a patent is duly filed accordingly. However, it is to<br>
