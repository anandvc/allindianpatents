The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases or free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. The salts are formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, preferably hydrochloric acid, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxylic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, N-acetylcystein and the like. In addition these salts may be prepared from addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid. Salts derived from an inorganic base include, but are not limited to, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium salts and the like. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, lysine, arginine, N-ethylpiperidine, piperidine, polymine resins and the like. The compound of formula I can also be present in the form of zwitterions. Particularly preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I are the hydrochloride salts.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be solvated, e.g. hydrated. The solvation can be effected in the course of the manufacturing process or can take place e.g. as a consequence of hygroscopic properties of an initially anhydrous compound of formula I (hydration). The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts also includes physiologically acceptable sol¬vates.<br><br>
"Isomers" are compounds that have identical molecular formulae but that differ in the nature or the sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereo¬isomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereo-isomers", and stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images are termed "enan-tiomers", or sometimes optical isomers. A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical sub-stituents is termed a "chiral center".<br>

The compounds of formula I are cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors.<br>
Atherosclerosis and its associated coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world. Risk for development of coronary heart disease has been shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels. Lipids are transported in the blood by lipoproteins. The general structure of lipoproteins is a core of neutral lipids (triglyceride and cholesterol ester) and an envelope of polar lipids (phospholipids and non esterified cholesterol). There are three different classes of plasma lipoproteins with different core lipid content: the low density lipoprotein (LDL) which is cholesteryl ester (CE) rich; high density lipoprotein (HDL) which is also cholesteryl ester (CE) rich; and the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) which is triglyceride (TG) rich. The different lipoproteins can be separated based on their different flotation density or size.<br>
High LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Plasma lipoprotein metabolism can be described as a flux of cholesterol between liver and the other tissues. The LDL pathway corresponds to the secretion of VLDL from the liver to deliver cholesterol by LDL to tissues. Any alteration in LDL catabolism could lead to uptake of excess cholesterol in the vessel wall forming foam cells and atherosclerosis. The opposite pathway is the mobilization of free cholesterol from peripheral tissues by HDL to<br><br>
deliver cholesterol to the liver to be eventually excreted with bile. In humans a significant part of cholesteryl ester (CE) is transferred from HDL to the VLDL, LDL pathway. This transfer is mediated by a 70,000 dalton plasma glycoprotein, the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).<br>
Mutations in the CETP gene associated with CETP deficiency are characterized by high HDL-cholesterol levels (&gt;60 mg/dL) and reduced cardiovascular risk. Such findings are consistent with studies of pharmacologically mediated inhibition of CETP in the rabbit, which argue strongly in favor of CETP inhibition as a valid therapeutic approach [Le Goff et al.. Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics 101:17-38 (2004); Okamoto et al. Nature 406:203-207 2000)].<br>
No wholly satisfactory HDL-elevating therapies exist. Niacin can significantly increase HDL, but has serious toleration issues which reduce compliance. Fibrates and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors raise HDL-cholesterol only modestly (-10-12%). As a result, there is a significant unmet medical need for a well tolerated agent which can significantly elevate plasma HDL levels. The net result of CETP activity is a lowering of HDL-C and an increase in LDL-C. This effect on lipoprotein profile is believed to be pro-atherogenic, especially in subjects whose lipid profile constitutes an increased risk for coronary heart disease. Therefore by inhibiting CETP activity there is the potential to inverse this relationship towards a lower risk and ultimately to protect against coronary heart diseases and associated mortality.<br>
Thus, CETP inhibitors are useful as medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbeta-lipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial hyper¬cholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, and vascular complications of diabetes, obesity or endotoxemia.<br>

combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)/ApoB secretion inhibitor, a PPAR activator, a bile acid reuptake inhibitor, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, a fibrate, niacin, an ion-exchange resin, an antioxidant, an ACAT inhibitor or a bile acid sequestrant for the treat¬ment and/or prophylaxis of diseases such as atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, and vascular complications of diabetes, obesity or endotoxemia, as well as to the use of such a combination for the preparation of corresponding medica¬ments.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. Specifically, it has been found that the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula I.<br>
Activity of CETP inhibitors was determined using a buffer assay system. Partially purified CETP transferred radiolabeled cholesteryl ester from HDL donor particles to biotin-labeled LDL acceptor particles. The reaction was stopped by addition of streptavidin-coupled scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads. These beads captured the biotinylated acceptor particles and transferred radioactivity was measured. The assay system was purchased and performed according to manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Inhibitory activity of compounds was determined as percentage of positive control activity containing CETP together with donor and acceptor particles. Serial dilution of compounds was performed in order to determine the IC50 values.<br>
Activity of the compounds was subsequently measured in the presence of plasma using the same assay as described above except that the source of CETP was human lipoprotein-de-prived serum (LPDS). Inhibitory activity of compounds was determined as percentage of positive control activity containing all the assay components except compound. Serial dilution of compounds was performed in order to determine the IC50 values.<br><br>
Under the latter assay conditions, the compounds of the present invention exhibit IC50 values within the range of about 1 nM to about 100 µM, e.g., of about 1 nM to about 1 µM, e.g., of about 1 nM to about 200 nM. The following table shows measured values for some selected compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
In vivo activity of the compounds of formula 1 were determined in hamster using the following protocol:<br>
Male golden Syrian hamsters (6-week-old, 100-130 g) under standard chow diet received compounds in the morning by oral gavage using appropriate vehicle, blood was taken 2 h later by retro-orbital bleeding under isofluran anaesthesia and 7 h later on sacrificed ani¬mals. Plasma was separated from blood using low speed centrifugation and CETP activity was measured in plasma using the radioactive CETP activity assay as described above except that diluted plasma replaced LPDS. In vivo CETP inhibition was expressed as CETP activity remaining in the plasma of treated animals as compared to plasma CETP activity of placebo treated animals.<br>
Efficacy of compounds in modulating plasma lipid levels can be determined in hamsters after 7 days of daily administration of compounds. Male hamsters are acclimated for 3-4 days to receive food as a paste made of 10 g chow and 10 g water per day. Compounds are then mixed within this paste and a portion containing the proper amount of compounds is given every morning for 7 days. Alternatively compounds can be given by oral gavage using the proper vehicle. Blood is taken before compound treatment by retro-orbital bleeding and at the end of the treatment on sacrificed animals. Plasma is separated from blood by low speed centrifugation and selected organs are taken (e.g liver, fat, brain, etc.). Effects of compounds on plasma lipid levels are determined by measuring total chole¬sterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride using colorimetric enzymatic assays (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDL-C<br><br>
are e.g., quantified using size exclusion chromatography on superpose-6 column using SMART^" system (Pharmacia). Lipoprotein distribution is calculated assuming a Gaussian distribution for each peak, using a non-linear, least-squares curve-fitting procedure to calculate the area under the curve. Plasma samples are also used to quantify CETP activity as described above. Compound concentration is also determined in plasma and selected tissues as liver, fat, heart, muscle and brain.<br>
Efficacy of compounds in modulating plasma lipid levels was also determined in chole¬sterol/fat fed hamsters. The protocol is identical as described above except that animals are fed with chow diet enriched with 10 % (w/w) saturated fat and 0.05 % (w/w) cholesterol. Animals received this high fat diet 2 weeks before starting compound administration and continued this diet throughout the study. The 2 weeks pre-treatment induced an increase in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels allowing a better assessment of LDL-C and triglyceride lowering.<br>
Efficacy of compounds in its ability to acutely raise HDL-C can be assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. Animals are fed with standard primate maintenance diet. Compounds are formulated with appropriate vehicle and administered to animals by oral gavage. Blood is taken before and at several time-points after compound administration (usually 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 7 h and 24 h). Plasma is separated fi-om blood by low speed centrifugation and CETP activity and plasma lipids are quantified. Compound potency and efficacy can be assessed by measuring the HDL-C increase after this single-dose admini¬stration. In such pharmacodynamic model the extent together with the kinetics of the pharmacologic effect can be assessed.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parente¬ral or topical administration. They can be administered, e.g., perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will<br><br>
be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable, into a galenical administration form to¬gether with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, e.g., lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine cap¬sules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, e.g., vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier mate¬rials for the production of solutions and syrups are, e.g., water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, e.g., water, alco¬hols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, e.g., natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each par¬ticular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is con¬venient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.1 -500 mg, e.g., 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br><br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br>
Example A:    Film coated tablets<br><br>
The active ingredient is sieved and mixed with microcrystalline cellulose and the mixture is granulated with a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidon in water. The granulate is mixed with sodium starch glycolate and magesiumstearate and compressed to yield kernels of 120 or 350 mg respectively. The kernels are lacquered with an aqueous solution / suspension of the above mentioned film coat.<br>
Example B:    Capsules<br><br><br><br>
The active ingredient is dissolved in a warm melting of the other ingredients and the mixture is filled into soft gelatin capsules of appropriate size. The filled soft gelatin capsules are treated according to the usual procedures.<br><br><br><br>
