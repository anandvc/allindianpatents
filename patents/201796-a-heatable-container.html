A further object of the invention is to provide a novel bitumen container in one arrangement which is capable of a certain degree of pressurization and accordingly suitable for conveying oil refinery residues, cut-back compositions of bitumen or the like.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a container suitable for bitumen, oil refinery residues, or the like which is provided with a heating facility whereby a large contact area of the container could transmit heat to the material to minimize degradation thereof.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention provides a beatable container comprises a vessel structure for containing flowable material, the vessel comprising a base zone, side wall zones, end wall zones, and a roof zone, characterized in that means for transmitting heat from a heating medium to at least the base zone of the container and thereafter to a zone disposed along a central axis of the vessel. Preferably the heating medium will also transmit heat to at least a lower part of the side wall of the vessel prior to passing through the central zone of the vessel.<br>
In one embodiment, the means for transmitting heat from the heating medium will be adapted to transmit heat to the base zone, the side wall zones and also to the roof zone of the container, and thereafter to a zone disposed along a generally central axis of the vessel.<br>
Also according to the invention, the means for transmitting heat from a heating medium to the vessel comprises an outer shell spaced from the vessel to define a pathway for heating medium between the vessel and such outer shell. Preferably, partitions will be provided in the space between the vessel and the outer shell to define a meandering pathway for the heating medium, such pathway terminating in an intemal heating duct which passes through a generally central zone of the vessel, and which terminates in an outlet for the heating medium.<br><br>
Alternatively, the means for transmitting heat from the heating medium to the vessel could be in the form of duct comprising a plurality of pipe lengths disposed longitudinally about the periphery of the container parallel to a longitudinal axis thereof, the pipe lengths being adapted to duct the heating medium therethrough to and fro along the length of the vessel, and terminating in an internal heating duct which passes through a generally central zone of the vessel, and which terminates in an outlet for the heating medium.<br>
Also according to the invention, the vessel is of an elongate cylindrical form of substantially circular cross-section, with the end zones thereof being enclosed by outwardly domed end wall structures.<br>
Further accordmg to the invention, the container is mounted on supports within an ISO frame. Preferably, the ends of the container will terminate short of the ends of the frame structure at one or preferably, both ends thereof. It has been found that this feature will permit access to equipment such as burners disposed at the end zones in situations wherein the container is parked against a bulkhead, or adjacent a similar container. Thus in one embodiment, one, or preferably both ends, will terminate approximately 0.5 metres short of the ends of the frame structure, where the latter is in the order of 6,058 metres. In accordance with ISO standards, the height and width of the frame structure will be 2.591 metres and 2.438 metres respectively.<br><br>
The invention envisages that the heating medium could be the combustion gasses of an oil or gas burner, or a heated liquid, or for example the exhaust gasses of an internal combustion engine, and the invention is not in any way limited to the type of heating medium employed. In one example, the exhaust gasses of a transport vehicle could be utilized as a heating medium during transportation of a container in accordance with the invention, and a such a method of supplying heat energy to the container of the invention, is included within the scope of the present invention.<br>

of the container in Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 5	is a schematic sectioned end elevation of the container in Figure 1;<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, a beatable container 10 which is particularly suitable for oil refinery residues, bitumen, cut-back, or other material which requires to be heated to a molten state prior to use, comprises an elongate vessel 11 having a base zone 11a, opposed side wall zones 11b, opposed end wall zones 11c, and a roof zone 11d. Figure 3. For most purposes the vessel 11 will be in the form of an elongate tube of generally circular cross-section, with domed end formations 11c, but the invention is not limited to such a configuration.<br>
It is a feature of the invention that a heating box is provided for heating the vessel 11, such heating box being in the form of an outer shell 12 spaced from the heating vessel 11 with partitions 16 therein defining a pathway 13, 14, for a heating medium such as combustion gasses from a burner 15, Figure 2. The heating pathway 13, 14, will preferably be in the form of a pathway which extends in a repeated to and fro fashion along the length of the vessel 11 as shown by the arrows 17, Figure 3. It is envisaged<br><br>
that the heating box 12 will extend at least along the base zone 11a of the Vessel 11, but preferably also at least partially up the side walls thereof 11b. In one configuration, Figures 3, 5, the heating box 12 will extend along the base zone 11a, side wall zones 11b and roof zone 11d of the vessel 11.<br>
It is a further feature of the invention that the pathway 13, 14, for the heating medium will include a final section 13a, 14a, which passes generally longitudinally through the vessel 11, and communicates with a outlet chimney. It has been found that the heating medium progressively cools down as it passes in an out and back direction along the pathway 13, 14, defined at the base and side wall and roof zones 11a, 11b, 11d, of the vessel 11, and that it is sufficiently cooled to pass through the body of the vessel 11 along its final section 13a, 14a, before being exhausted through the chimney outlet 13b, 14b. Thus, it has been found that the heating medium in the final section 13a, 14a, will not cause thermal shock to material such as bitumen or the like. It has also been found that when heat is applied to a solid body of bitumen or the like, melting takes place firstly along the inner walls of the vessel 11, so that a core of non-molten material remains generally along the longitudinal axis of the vessel 11. By passing the final section 13a, 14a, of the heating pathway 13, 14, along the zone of the longitudinal axis of the vessel, the core of non-molten material can effectively be heated to reduce the overall heating tune and energy required for transforming a body of bitumen to the required molten state.  As mentioned above, the temperature in the<br><br>
final section 13a, 14a, of the pathway 13, 14, will be sufficiently low, not to cause thermal shock or otherwise degrade the material being heated.<br>
In Figures 3 and 5, an arrangement is shown wherein the heating box 12 extends over the base zone 11a, the side wall zones 11b, of the vessel 11 and also over the roof zone 11d thereof It has been found that such an arrangement is efficient in that a large percentage of the heating energy of the heating medium is utilized. In alternative arrangements, not shown, the heating box could extend only along the base zone 11a or along the base zone 11a and a portion or the entire side wall zones 11b with the final section of the heating duct passing through the vessel substantially longitudinally.<br>
With the arrangements above, it is envisaged that a heat source such as a gas or oil burner 15 can be disposed at each end of the heating box 12 towards the lower zone thereof as illustrated. In such an event, two pathways 13 and 14 will be defined by the heating box 12 with each end section 13a, 14a, thereof passing longitudinally through the vessel. In an alternative arrangement, the heat source could comprise exhaust gasses of an internal combustion engine, and in such a case the exhaust gas of the transport vehicle could be utilized during transport of the container of the invention. Heating source could also for example be in the form of a heated liquid such as oil and in such a case, the pathway for the heated liquid will preferably be in the form of a plurality of pipes 18 which are arranged in a to and fro fashion as shown in Figure 4,<br><br>
with a final section of the pipes 18 passing through the central zone of the vessel 11, before being exhausted through an outlet 18b.<br>
The invention further provides that the vessel 11 and heating box 12 of the invention will be mounted in a frame 19, preferably an ISO frame of standard dimensions (height 2.591 metres; width 2.591 metres; and length 6.058 metres, to facilitate transport and storage. With such an arrangement, the ends of the vessel 11 will preferably terminate short of the ends of the frame 19, Figure 2, to provide access to the burners 15 where the structure 19 is sandwiched between adjacent structures 19 or against the bulkhead, not shown. Preferably, the ends of a vessel will terminate approximately 0.5 metres short of the end of the frame 19 for this purpose. However, the invention is not limited to the arrangement described above, and in cases where maximum volume is required, the vessel and heating box could substantially fill the interior space of the ISO frame 19.<br>
Doubtless other variations are possible without departing from the principles set out in the appended claims. For example, the heating box 12 will preferably be provided with an outer layer of insulation 20 within an outer protective shell 21.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
