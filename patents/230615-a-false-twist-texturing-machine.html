False twist texturing machine<br>
The invention relates to a false twist texturing machine for the false twist texturing of a multiplicity of threads according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Such a false twist texturing machine is known, for example, from US 3,381,462.<br>
In the known false twist texturing machine, a multiplicity of processing stations are arranged next to one another. Each processing station has a plurality of process assemblies in order to draw off a fed thread from a feed bobbin, texture it, draft it and wind it into a bobbin. In this case, during a bobbin change in the processing stations, the threads are picked up by a suck-off device and led to a thread collection device.<br>
In false twist texturing machines of this type, up to two hundred and sixteen processing stations are formed next to one another, so that a multiplicity of threads have to be led through the suck-off device in order to be picked up by the thread collection device. In systems of this type, there is the fundamental problem that, if the conveying capacity of the suck-off device is insufficient, faults in the transporting away of the threads are unavoidable. Moreover, on account of the long distances between the processing stations and the thread collection device, deflections and narrows in the suck-off device must be avoided as far as possible, since this would cause flow losses which, in turn, promote the risk of blockages.<br>
The object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a false twist texturing machine of the type initially mentioned, in which the threads of the processing stations can be led away in an operationally reliable manner during the bobbin change.<br><br>
A further aim of the invention is to provide a false twist texturing machine in which groups of processing stations can be used flexibly,<br>
A further object of the invention is, in the generic false twist texturing machine, to provide a suck-off device in which the energy sources present during operation can be used for leading away the threads.<br>
For a false twist texturing machine of the type specified in the preamble of claim 1, the solution is achieved in that the suck-off device is formed by a plurality of separately controllable field suck-off devices which are assigned in each case to a group of more than ten processing stations, and in that the thread collection device has for each field suck-off device in each case a yarn waste container.<br>
The invention is distinguished in that the yarn waste to be picked up from the processing stations can be led along the shortest possible path to a collection point. Consequently, the threads can in each case be led away reliably by means of relatively low flow energies. A further advantage of the invention is to be seen in that the processing stations assigned to the field suck-off devices can process different thread materials independently of the adjacent processing stations, since the yarn waste containers assigned to the thread suck-off devices cause a separation of the thread waste. In this case, however, a specific number of processing stations assigned to a field suck-off device of at least ten must be maintained. In the case of a number of processing stations of less than ten, however, the advantages mentioned are diminished due to an increased outlay in terms of the operation of the yarn waste containers. To that extent, advantageously, even a larger number of processing stations can be<br><br>
operated by means of one field suck-off device. Thus, for example, the two hundred and sixteen processing stations of a false twist texturing machine could be operated by means of eighteen,  twelve or six field suck-off devices.<br>
To lead away the threads picked up in the processing stations, basically, different variants of the field suck-off devices can be used. In a first design variant, each of the field suck-off devices possesses a field injector which is connected by means of a suction connection to a collecting tube and by means of a blowing connection to the assigned yarn waste container.<br>
In a further version of the field suck-off devices, a vacuum source and a collecting tube are provided, which are connected to the assigned yarn waste containers via separate connections. The threads are thereby sucked into the yarn waste container.<br>
The tie-up of the processing stations can advantageously be implemented by means of suction nipples which issue directly into the collecting tube.<br>
In a further particularly advantageous design of the false twist texturing machine, the field suck-off devices are formed by guide tubes with station injectors which are assigned to the processing stations. In this case, the threads are sucked in at one end of the guide tube on account of the inj ector action of the station injector and are blown out at the opposite end of the guide tube. For this purpose, the guide tubes are connected at their blowing ends to the assigned yarn waste container.<br>
Basically, the blowing ends of the guide tubes may issue into the assigned yarn waste container separately<br><br>
in groups or jointly via a collecting tube.<br>
The station injectors are preferably connected to a compressed-air supply by means of a controllable switching valve, so that a conveyor medium is introduced into the guide tube only in the event of thread transport.<br>
In the cases where the thread waste is blown into the yarn waste container by the field suck-off devices, there is a particularly advantageous development of the invention in which the yarn waste container is formed in each case by a thread waste bag which is held releasably in the machine stand.<br>
In this case, it is particularly advantageous if the thread waste bags consist of a thread material processed in the group of processing stations, so that they can be recycled together with the thread residues collected in them. There is therefore no need for the thread waste to be emptied out and transferred.<br>
So that the thread waste can be led out of the processing stations as far as possible at a low outlay in terms of energy, the yarn waste container is preferably arranged in the lower region of the machine stand.<br>
There is also the possibility, however, that the yarn waste containers are arranged jointly in a collecting space outside the machine, at the end of the machine or laterally with respect to the machine. Operation for emp tying or disposing of the yarn waste can consequently be simplified.<br>
Flexibility in terms of the processing of different thread material can be improved substantially by means of the development of the invention in which the<br><br>
process  assemblies  forming  a  group  of	processing<br>
stations can be controlled independently of	the process<br>
assemblies of the adjacent group of	processing<br>
stations.<br>
The invention is described in more detail below by-means of some exemplary embodiments, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
fig. 1 and 2  show diagrammatically a plurality of<br>
views of an exemplary embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention;<br>
fig. 3        shows diagrammatically a first design<br>
variant of the field suck-off device;<br>
fig. 4        shows diagrammatically a further design<br>
variant of the field suck-off device, and<br>
fig. 5        shows diagrammatically a further design<br>
variant of the field suck-off device.<br>
Fig. 1 and fig. 2 illustrate diagrammatically an exemplary embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention. In this case, fig. 1 shows a top view of the false twist texturing machine, and fig. 2 shows a side view of the false twist texturing machine. Insofar as no express reference is made to one of the figures, the following description applies to both figures.<br>
The false twist texturing machine has a machine stand 4. The machine stand 4 is formed in this case by a module stand 4.1, a process stand 4.2 and a winding stand 4.3 which are connected fixedly to one another. A separate creel stand 7 is arranged at a distance from<br><br>
the module stand.<br>
In the machine stand 4, a multiplicity of processing stations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. are arranged next to one another in parallel in the longitudinal direction. Conventionally,  in a false twist texturing machine, more than two hundred processing stations, preferably two hundred and eighteen processing stations,  are provided. In the exemplary embodiment in fig. 1, only the first three processing stations are identified by way of example by the reference symbols 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. In each of the processing stations 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, in each case at least one thread 3 is processed. The multiplicity of processing stations are divided into a plurality of processing groups 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, etc. In the exemplary embodiment shown in fig. 1, in each case twelve processing stations lying next to one another form a processing group 2.1. In this respect, fig. 1 illustrates by way of example the first two processing groups 2.1 and 2.2 and, in part, the third processing group 2.3. Each group of processing stations 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc. contains a plurality of process assemblies which are held in the machine stand 4, so as to form a station structure, and which draw off in parallel from feed bobbins the threads assigned to the group of processing stations, texture these threads, draft them and wind them into bobbins.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates diagrammatically, by the reference symbols 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 18, only some of the process assemblies which are provided in the processing stations. Reference symbol 10 identifies the group of draw-off delivery units, each processing station being assigned in each case a draw-off delivery unit in order to draw off a thread 3 from a feed bobbin 8. The feed bobbin 8 is received in the creel stand 7. For drafting and texturing, the thread 3 is led, in the processing stations, for example the processing station 1.1, into<br><br>
a false twist zone which is formed by the primary-heating device 11, the cooling device 12 and the false twist texturing assembly 13. Thereafter, the thread 3 is subjected in each of the processing stations to heat treatment which takes place by means of the secondary heating device 16. At the end of processing, the thread 3 is wound into a bobbin 21 of the winding device 18, said bobbin being held on a bobbin holder. The winding devices 18 occupy a width of three processing stations, and therefore in each case three winding devices, discussed later, are arranged one above the other in a column in the winding stand 4.3.<br>
For further explanation, the process assemblies of the processing station 1.1 are illustrated diagrammatically in a side view in fig. 2. The process assemblies arranged in the machine stand 4 so as to form a station structure are formed in the processing group 2.1 by a draw-off delivery unit 10, a prijnary heading device 11, a cooling device 12, a false twist texturing assembly 13, a drafting delivery unit 14, a swirling device 38, a set delivery unit 15, a secondary heating device 16, a supply delivery unit 17 and a winding, device 18, the process assemblies being arranged one behind the other with respect to a thread run. In this case, between the module stand 4.1 and the process stand 4.2, an operating aisle 5 is formed, from which the operation of the process assemblies during the first piecing-up takes place.<br>
The delivery units 10, 14, 15 and 17 are of identical construction in the station structure of the processing group 2.1. Each of the delivery units is in this case formed by a driven galette and an assigned freely rotatable run-over roller. Thus, as is illustrated at the draw-off delivery unit 10, the drive takes place by means of an individual drive 25 which is preferably formed by an electric motor. The false twist texturing<br><br>
assembly 13 is likewise driven by an individually controllable false twist drive 26.<br>
In the winding stand 4.3, overall, three winding devices 18 of adjacent processing stations are arranged one above the other in tiers. The winding device 18 is identified diagrammatically by a traverse 20, a driving roller 19 and a bobbin 21. Moreover, the winding device 18 holds a core magazine 22 so that an automatic bobbin change can be executed. The auxiliary devices required for exchanging the full bobbins are in this case not illustrated in any more detail. The auxiliary devices could be designed, for example, as is known from EP 0 916 612 Al. Reference is made to that extent to the publication mentioned. The winding devices of the processing groups form a machine longitudinal side, over the length of which a doffing aisle 6 extends. The full bobbins can be transported away from the doffing aisle 6.<br>
As may be gathered from fig. 1 and 2, a plurality of field suck-off devices 27.1, 27.2, 27.3, etc. are provided for picking up the threads during the bobbin change in the processing stations. In this case, each group of processing stations 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc. is assigned in each case one of the field suck-off devices 27.1, 27.2 and 27.3. Each field suck-off device 27.1, 27.2 and 27.3 has a tube system 39 and a flow generator 40. The design of the field suck-off device is described in more detail below. Each field suck-off device 27.1, 27.2 and 27.3 is assigned a yarn waste container 28.1, 28.2 and 28.3. The thread waste from the processing stations of the processing group 2.1 is thus picked up by the field suck-off device 27.1 and conveyed into the yarn waste container 28.1. Correspondingly, the thread waste from the processing stations of the processing group 2.2 is conducted to the yarn waste container 28.2 by the field suck-off<br><br>
device 27.2.<br>
The yarn waste containers 28.1, 28.2 and 28.3 are preferably arranged releasably in the lower region of the machine stand 4, preferably in the lower region of the process stand 4.2. The yarn waste containers 28.1, 28.2 and 28.3 can consequently be removed from the operating aisle 5 in order to dispose of the thread waste.<br>
Fig. 3 shows diagrammatically a first design variant of the field suck-off device, such as can be used, for example, in the exemplary embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to fig. 1.<br>
The winding devices 18.1, 18.2 and 18.3 arranged one above the other in tiers are in this case illustrated diagrammatically by the illustration of a bobbin. Each winding device 18.1, 18.2 and 18.3 is assigned a suction inlet port 33 of a tube system 39. The tube system 3 9 is in this case formed from a plurality of guide tubes 32 which have a station injector 31 in the immediate vicinity of the suction inlet port 33. The station injectors 31 provided for each winding station together form a flow generator and are connected to a compressed-air source, not illustrated here, via a controllable switching valve 41. The guide tubes 32 each have a blowing end 34. The blowing ends 34 of the guide tubes 32 issue directly in front of the orifice of a yarn waste container 28. The yarn waste container 28 is designed as a thread waste bag 37. The thread waste bag 37 is held in a holder 42 in a lower region of, for example, the process stand 4.2. The thread waste bag 32 is produced as a sheetlike textile structure, in particular, from a woven fabric, knitted fabric or nonwoven fabric. In this case, the material for the thread waste bag is preferably formed from the thread material which is processed in the respective<br><br>
group of processing stations. The thread waste collected in the thread waste bag can consequently be disposed of and recycled together with the thread waste bag.<br>
The tube system 39 illustrated in fig. 4 could be designed in such a way that, for example, all the processing stations adjacent to one another in a tier have in each case a guide tube issuing with its blowing end into a collecting tube. Thus, overall, there would be three collecting tubes which are assigned to each tier and which then issue with their blowing ends into the yarn waste container. It is also possible, however, that all the guide tubes of the processing stations of a processing group run jointly into one collecting tube.<br>
Fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a further exemplary embodiment of a field suck-off device 27. In this case, the flow generator 40 is formed by a vacuum source 36. The vacuum source 36 is connected directly to a yarn waste container 28. For this purpose, the yarn waste container 28 is formed by a closed container. The tube system 39 is connected to the yarn waste container 28. The tube system 39 is in this case formed by a collecting tube 29 and a plurality of suction nipples 30 which in each case have a suction inlet port 33 assigned to the winding devices 18.1 to 18.3. In this case, the free ends of the suction nipples 30 may be assigned closing means which open the suction inlet port 33 only as required.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a further design variant of the field suck-off device, such as could be used, for example, in the false twist texturing machine according to fig. 1. In this case, the field suck-off device has as a flow generator 40 a field injector 35 which is connected  to  a  compressed-air  supply.  The  field<br><br>
injector 35 has a suction connection 43 and a blowing connection 44. The tube system 3 9 is connected to the suction connection 43. The blowing connection 44 issues directly into the yarn waste container 28. The tube system 39 connected to the field injector 35 is identical to the preceding exemplary embodiment according to fig. 4. Reference is made to that extent to the above description.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the false twist texturing machine, as illustrated in fig. 1, one field suck-of f device is assigned a number of twelve processing stations. The number of processing stations is just one example. In principle, even more than twelve processing stations could be supplied simultaneously by one field suck-off device. The apportionment and assignment may be predetermined as a function of the intended use of the false twist texturing machine. Thus, for example, WO 01/092615 discloses a false twist texturing machine in which the process assemblies of the processing groups can be controlled and regulated independently of the process assemblies of the adjacent processing groups. To that extent, the false twist texturing machine illustrated in fig. 1 can be designed in the same way, so that high flexibility in terms of the processing of different thread materials can be implemented particularly advantageously. For the design of t a false twist texturing machine of this type, reference is made at this juncture to the publication mentioned.<br>
The aim in the selection of the number of processing stations supplied by a field suck-off device is to ensure that as low an outlay as possible in terms of operation is maintained. To that extent, there must be a minimum number of processing stations of ten which are supplied by a thread suck-off device.<br><br>
