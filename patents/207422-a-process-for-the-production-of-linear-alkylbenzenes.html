ALKYLATION OF BENZENE TO FORM LINEAR ALKYLBENZENES USING FLUORINE-CONTAINING MORDENTTES<br>
Prakasa Rao Anantaneni<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to the alkylation of benzene with olefins using mordenite catalysts.<br>
Linear alkylbenzenes (LAB's) having long chains (typically 10-14 carbons) are commonly used, commercial products. LAB's are commonly sulfonated to thereby produce surfactants.<br>
Typically, LAB's are manufactured commercially using classic Friedal-Crafts chemistry, employing catalysts such as aluminum chloride, or using strong acid catalysts such as hydrogen fluoride, for example, to alkylate benzene with olefins. While such methods produce high conversions, the selectivity to the 2-phenyl isomer is low, generally being about 30% or less. LAB's with a high percentage of the 2-phenyl isomer are highly desired because such compounds when sulfonated have long "tails" which provide enhanced solubility and detergent properties.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been recognized that a need exists for a method of LAB production having high substrate olefin conversion, high selectivity* to 2-phenyl isomer -LAB, and employing a catalyst having long lifetimes and easy handling. This invention provides a solution to one or more of the problems and disadvantages described above.<br>
The mordenite catalyst of this invention may be mixed with a different catalyst that does not afford high 2-phenyl isomer LAB production. The amounts of each catalyst can thus be adjusted to provide the desired levels of 2-phenyl isomer LAB in the product stream. In this way, LAB may be produced having a higher 2-phenyl isomer content than would be produced using the non-mordenite catalyst of this invention.<br>
In one broad respect, this invention is a process for the production of linear alkylbenzenes, comprising:<br>
contacting benzene and an olefin having about 8 to about 30 carbons in the presence of a mixed catalyst bed to form linear alkylbenzenes, wherein the mixed catalyst bed comprises fluorine-containing mordenite and a second, solid linear alkylbenzene alkylation catalyst, wherein the second alkylation catalyst has a selectivity to the 2-phenyl isomer of the linear alkylbenzenes less than the selectivity of the fluorine-containing mordenite.<br>
In another broad respect, this invention is a process for the production of linear alkylbenzenes, comprising:<br>
dehydrogenating a paraffin to form an olefin;<br>
sending a feed stream of benzene and the olefin through a conduit to a linear alkylbenzenes alkylation reactor containing a fluorine-containing mordenite and a second alkylation catalyst, wherein the second alkylation catalyst has a selectivity to the 2-phenyl isomer of the linear alkylbenzenes less than the selectivity of the fluorine-containing mordenite;<br>
reacting the benzene and olefin in the reactor to form 'a crude linear alkylbenzenes stream;<br><br>
distilling the crude linear alkylbenzenes stream in a first distillation column to separate benzene that did not react and to form a benzene-free linear alkylbenzenes stream;<br>
distilling the benzene-free linear alkylbenzenes stream in a second distillation column<br>
*<br>
to separate any paraffin present and to form a paraffin-free linear alkylbenzenes stream;<br>
distilling the paraffin-free linear alkylbenzene stream in a third distillation column to provide an overhead of a purified linear alkylbenzene stream and removing a bottoms stream containing heavies.<br>
This invention, in another broad respect, is a process useful for the production of monoalkylated benzene, comprising contacting benzene with an olefin containing from about 8 to about 30 carbons in the presence of fluorine-containing mordenite under conditions such that linear monoalkylated benzene is formed.<br>
In a second broad resppct, this invention is a process useful for the production of monoalkylated benzene, comprising introducing a feed comprising olefin having about 8 to about 30 carbons and benzene into a fluorine-containing mordenite catalyst bed under conditions such that monoalkylated benzene is produced, allowing benzene, olefin, and monoalkylated benzene to descend (fall) into a reboiler from the catalyst bed, removing monoalkylated benzene from the reboiler, and heating the contents of the reboiler such that benzene refluxes to further contact the fluorine-containing mordenite.<br>
In another broad aspect, this invention relates to mordenite useful for alkylating benzene with olefin having a silica to alumina molar ratio of about 10:1 to about 100:1; wherein the mordenite has been treated with an aqueous hydrogen fluoride solution such that the mordenite contains from about 0.1 to about 4 percent fluorine by weight.<br>
In another broad respect, this invention is a method useful for the preparation of fluorine-containing mordenite, comprising contacting a mordenite having a silica to alumina molar ratio in a range from about 10:1 to about 100:1 with an aqueous hydrogen fluoride solution having a concentration of hydrogen fluoride in the range* of from about 0.1 to about 10<br><br>
percent by weight such that the mordenite containing fluorine is produced, collecting the fluorine-containing mordenite by filtration, and drying.<br>
The fluorine treated mordenite catalyst advantageously produces-high selectivities to the 2-phenyl isomer in the preparation of LAB, generally producing selectivities of about 70 percent or more. Also, the fluorine treated mordenite enjoys a long lifetime, preferably experiencing only a 25 percent or less decrease in activity after 400 hours on stream. A process operated in accordance with the apparatus depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2 has the advantage that rising benzene from the reboiler continuously cleans the catalyst to thereby increase lifetime of the catalyst. In addition, this invention advantageously produces only low amounts of dialkylated benzene, which is not particularly as useful for detergent manufacture," as well as only low amounts of tetralin derivatives.<br>
Certain terms and phrases have the following meanings as used herein.<br>
"Meq/g" means milliequivalents of titratable acid per gram of catalyst, which is a unit used to describe acidity of the catalysts. Acidity is generally determined by titration with a base, as by adding excessive base, such as sodium hydroxide, to the catalyst and then back titrating the catalyst.<br>
"Conv." and "Conversion" mean the mole percentage of a given reactant converted to product. Generally, olefin conversion is about 95 percent or more in the practice of this invention.<br>
"Sel." and "Selectivity" mean the mole percentage of a particular component in the product. Generally, selectivity to the 2-phenyl isomer is about 70 or more in the practice of this invention.<br>
The mordenite catalyst of the present invention is useful as a catalyst in the production of LAB's in accordance with the process of manufacturing LAB's of this invention.  LAB is " useful as starting material to produce sulfonated LAB, which itself is useful as a surfactant.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Catalyst Preparation and Properties<br>
The catalyst of this invention is a fluorine-containing mordenite. Mordenite is a type of zeolite. The catalyst of this invention is prepared from hydrogen mordenite (typically having 0.1 percent or less of sodium) having a silica-alumina molar ratio of from about 10:1 to about 100:1. More typically, the starting mordenite has a silica/alumina molar ratio of from about 10:1 to about 50:1. The starting hydrogen mordenite, which is commonly available commercially, is treated with an aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride ("HF") to produce the active, long-life and highly selective catalyst of the invention. In the course of such HF treatment, as well as during subsequent calcination of said HF-treated mordenite, the silica/alumina molar ratio typically increases. The finished catalysts of this invention show a fluorine content of from about 0.1 to about 4 percent by weight, more typically about 1 percent.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the HF reacts with sites where -Si-O-Al- linkages occur such that the linkage is broken with fluorine becoming bonded to the" Al such that -Si-OH and F-Al- groups form. This is, Believed to decrease the total Bronsted acid sites and increase the strength of the remaining acid sites in the mordenite and is<br><br>
believed to stabilize the acidity of the mordenite such that the mechanisms which degrade performance during LAB production, such as coke build-up, are retarded.<br>
The aqueous solution used to treat the mordenite may contain a range of HF concentrations. Generally, the HF concentration is a minimum of about 0.1 percent by weight. Below such minimum concentration, the effect of the fluorine treatment significantly decreases, resulting in the undesirable need for repeated treatments. Generally, the HF concentration on the upper end is about 10 percent by weight or less. Above a concentration of about 10 percent by weight, the HF is so concentrated that it is difficult to prevent HF from destroying the crystallinity of the mordenite, thereby detrimentally affecting its efficacy as a catalyst for LAB<br>
*<br>
production.<br>
The aqueous HF solution may be prepared by diluting commercially available 48% HF solutions to the desired concentration. Alternatively, HF can be sparged into water to provide an aqueous HF solution.<br>
Typically, the treatment is carried out by adding mordenite powder or pellets to a stirred<br>
aqueous HF solution at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 50°C.   The stirring and<br>
■		<br>
contacting is continued for a time sufficient to achieve the desired level of fluorine in the<br>
mordenite. This time may vary depending on factors such as HF concentration, amount of HF<br>
solution relative to the amount of mordenite being treated, speed of agitation is employed, and<br>
temperature. After treatment, the mordenite can be recovered by filtration, and then dried. It is<br>
also possible to impregnate the mordenite to incipient wetness with a given HF solution, as well<br>
as to treat the mordenite with gaseous hydrogen fluoride; Preferably said fluoride-treated<br>
mordenite would be calcined in air prior to use in alkylation service. The preferred calcination<br>
temperature would be in the range from about 400 °C to about 600 °C. Alternative mordenite<br>
fluorinating agents to hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen fluoride include ammonium fluoride,<br>
fluorided silicon compounds and fluorided hydrocarbons.<br>
The HF-treated mordenite of this invention generally h^s about 0.1 percent by weight or more of fluorine based on the total weight of the mordenite. Typically, the fluorine-containing<br><br>
mordenite contains about 4 percent by weight or less fluorine.    The fluorine-containing mordenite most typically contains about 1 percent by weight of fluorine.<br>
The mordenite can be used in the practice of this inventiorr as a powder, in pellet form, as granules, or as extrudates. The mordenite can be formed into pellets or extrudates using binders well known to those of skill in the art, such as alumina, silica or mixtures thereof.<br>
Reactants for LAB Production<br>
In the practice of this invention, benzene is alkylated with olefin to form LAB. These reactants can be handled and purified as is generally performed by those of skill in the art. In this regard, it is preferred that the reactants are water and alcohol free The olefins employed in the practice of this invention have from about 8 to about 30 carbons, preferably from about 10 to about 14 carbons, such as is available commercially or produced as dehydrogenated paraffin feed stocks. It is preferred that the olefin be monounsaturated. It is most preferred that the olefin be an alpha-olefin containing a terminal ethylenic unit.<br>
* Commonly, said olefins would be available in a paraffinic media of the same carbon<br>
range. Olefins in the 10 to 14 carbon number range would typically be available from C.I0 to C.<br>
l4 paraffin dehydrogenatipn in a C.l0 to C.M paraffin mixture having an olefin content of 5 to<br>
20%. Often, the olefin content of said olefin-paraffin mixture would be 8 to 10 weight %.<br>
The 2-phenyl isomer of the LAB produced in accordance with this invention is of formula:<br><br><br>
wherein n is from about 5 to about 17 and preferably from about 7 to about 11.<br>
Process Conditions, Procedures, and Apparatus<br>
The process of this invention can be carried out using the continuous reactive distillation column depicted in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, a feed mixture of benzene and olefin, generally at a benzene-to-olefin molar ratio range of about 1:1 to 100:1 flows from feed pump 10 to feed inlet 14 via line 12. The feed mixture falls to packed mordenite catalyst bed 32 where alkylation in the presence of the fluorine-containing mordenite occurs. Alternatively, while not depicted in FIG. 1, the benzene and olefin can be introduced separately into the bed with mixing occurring in the bed, or the reactants can be mixed via an in-line mixer prior to introducing the reactants into the catalyst bed, or the reactants can be injected separately above the bed with mixing affected by use of standard packing above the bed, or the reactants can be sparged into the<br>
*<br>
chamber above the bed.  The catalyst bed 32 depicted in FIG. 1 for laboratory scale may be<br>
made of two lengths of 1.1 inch internal diameter tubing, the lengths being 9.5 inches and 22<br>
inches. In the catalyst bed 32, the falling feed mixture also contacts rising vapors of unreacted<br>
benzene which has been heated to reflux in reboiler 42 by heater 40. Such rising vapors pass<br>
* over thermocouple 38 which monitors temperature to provide feedback to heater 40. The rising<br>
. vapors of benzene and/or olefin also pass through standard packing 36 (e.g., 7.5 inches of<br>
goodloe packing).    The rising vapors heat thermocouple 30 which connects to bottoms<br>
temperature controller 28 which activates heater 40 when temperature drops below a set level.<br>
Prior to startup, the system may be flushed with nitrogen which enters via line 54 and which flows through line 58. After startup, a nitrogen blanket is maintained over the system. Also prior to startup and during nitrogen flush, it may be desirable to heat catalyst bed 32 so as to drive off water from the fluorine-containing mordenite.<br>
Residual water from the feed mixture or which otherwise enters the system is collected in water trap 24 upon being liquified at condenser 21 (along wijtibenzene vapor). If the feed is very dry (free of water) the water trap 24 may not be needed. Removing water leads to longer<br><br>
catalyst lifetime. Hence, the water trap 24 is optional. The same applies to FIG. 2. Condenser 21 is cooled via coolant such as water entering condenser 21 via port 22 and exiting via port 20. As needed, water in water trap 24 may be drained by opening drain valve 26.<br>
As needed, when LAB content in reboiler 42 rises to a desired level, the bottoms LAB product may be removed from the system via line 47, using either gravity or bottoms pump 48 to withdraw the product. When product is so withdrawn, valve 44 is opened.<br>
In FIG. 1, dip tube 46, which is optional, is employed to slightly increase the pressure in reboiler 42 to thereby raise the boiling point of benzene a degree or two. Likewise, a pressure generator 56 may be optionally employed to raise the pressure of the system. Other standard pressure increasing devices can be employed. Pressure can thus be increased in the system such that the boiling point of benzene increases up to about 200 °C.<br>
In FIG. 1, control mechanisms for heat shutoff 50 and pump shutoff 52 are depicted which serve to shut off heat and pump if the liquids level in the system rises to such levels. These control mechanisms are optional and may be included so that the catalyst bed does not come into contact with the bottoms of the reboiler.<br>
In the practice of this invention in the alkylation of benzene, a wide variety of process conditions can be employed. In this regard, the temperature in the catalyst bed may vary depending on reactants, rate of introduction into the catalyst bed, size of the bed, and so forth. Generally, the bed is maintained at the reflux temperature of benzene depending on pressure.<br>
Typically, the temperature of the catalyst bed is above about 70°C, and most likely about 78 °C<br>
•<br>
or more in order to have reasonable reaction ratps, and about 200 °C or less to avoid degradation of reactants and products and to avoid deactivation of the catalyst by coke build-up. Preferably, the temperature is in the range from about 80 °C to about 140 °C. The process may be operated at a variety of pressures during the contacting step, with pressures of about atmospheric most typically being employed. When the process is operated using a system as depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the reboiler temperature is maintained such that bejizene and olefin vaporize, the temperature varying depending on olefin, and generally being from about 80 °C to about 250 °C<br><br>
for olefins having 10 to 14 carbons. The composition of the reboiler will vary over time, but is generally set initially to have a benzene olefin ratio of about 5:1, with this ratio being maintained during the practice of this invention. The rate of introduction of feed into the catalyst bed may vary, and is generally at a liquid hourly space velocity ("LHSV") of about 0.05 hr*1 to about 10 hr*1, more typically from about 0.05 hr'1 to about 1 hr'1. The mole ratio of benzene to olefin introduced into the catalyst bed is generally from about 1:1 to about 100:1. In commercial benzene alkylation operations, it is common to run at mole ratios of from about 2:1 to about 20:1, which can suitably be employed in the practice of this invention, and to charge said olefins as an olefin-paraffin mixture comprising 5% to 20% olefin content. Said olefin-paraffin mixtures are normally generated commercially through dehydrogenation of the corresponding paraffin starting material over a noble metal catalyst.<br>
Another continuous reactive distillation apparatus is depicted in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, the feed mixture enters the reactor via feed inlet 114. The feed mixture falls through the column into catalyst bed 132, wherein alkylation to form LAB occurs. A thermowell 133 monitors the temperature of said catalyst bed 132. The catalyst bed 132 may be optionally heated externally and is contained within 1-1/4 inch stainless steel tubing. Goodloe packing is positioned at packing 136 and 137. LAB product, as well as unreacted benzene and olefin, fall through packing 136 into reboiler 142. In reboiler 142, electric heater 140 heats the contents of reboiler 142 such that heated vapors of benzene and olefin rise from the reboiler 142 to at least reach catalyst bed 132. As needed, the bottoms LAB product may be removed from reboiler 142 by opening bottoms valve 144 after passing through line 147 and filter 145. Residual water from the feed mixture, or which otherwise enters the system, may be. condensed at condenser 121 which is cooled with coolant via inlet line 122 and exit line 120. The condensed wafer falls to water trap 124, which can be drained as needed by opening drain valve 126. Temperature in the system is monitored via thermocouples 138, 130, and 165. The system includes pressure release valve 166. A nitrogen blanket over the system is maintained by introduction of nitrogen gas via inlet line 154. Level control activator 150 activates bottoms level control valve 151 to open when the liquids level in the reboiler rises to the level control activator 150.<br><br>
While the systems depicted in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 show single catalyst bed systems, it may be appreciated that multi-catalyst bed reactors are within the scope of this invention, as well as multiple ports for inlet feeds, water traps, product removal lines, and so forth. Moreover, the process may be run in batch mode, or in other continuous processes using plugflow designs, trickle bed designs, and fluidized bed designs.<br>
It is believed that as average molecular weight of olefins increases, particularly when the average number of carbons exceed 14, the selectivity and conversion to LAB, especially LAB with the 2-isomer, may incrementally decrease. If desired, the product of the alkylation using HF-treated mordenite may be sent to a second, finishing catalyst bed to improve yield. This procedure is optional and is believed to be dependent on the needs and desires of the end user. An example of such a second catalyst is HF-treated clay such as montmorillonite clay having about 0.5% fluoride. Such a catalyst may also serve to lower the bromine number below about 0.1, depending on conditions.<br>
Variable 2-phenyl Isomer Content of Product Using the Mordenite of this Invention In Combination with a Second, Solid LAB Alkylation Catalyst<br>
* The fluorine-containing mordenite of this invention generally produces LAB having<br>
high 2-phenyl isomer content, such as higher than about 70%. Currently, LAB purchasers who<br>
make detergents would prefer to use LAB having a 2-phenyl isomer content in the range from<br>
about 30 to about 40 percent   Conventional LAB alkylation technology does not, however,<br>
achieve these higher 2-phenyl isomer levels. HF, for instance, produces about 16-18 percent of<br>
the 2-phenyl isomer in the product stream from the reactor. Aluminum chloride, on the other<br>
hand, produces 26-28 percent of the 2-phenyl isomer in LAB. The present inventor recognized<br>
that a need exists for a process which produces a 2-phenyl isomer product in the desired range.<br>
It has now been found that the mordenite of this invention can be used in combination with conventional solid LAB alkylation catalysts, such as^ silica-alumina (with or without fluorine treatment, such as disclosed in U. S. Patent 5,196,574), clay and aluminum chloride. Since conventional LAB alkylation catalysts produce product having a 2-phenyl isomer content<br><br>
miwn icss inan tnai irom tne mordemte, combining the mordenite of this invention and a second solid alkylation catalyst may be used to achieve an LAB product having a higher 2-phenyl isomer content than which could be achieved by the conventional, solid LAB alkylation catalyst alone. In practice, the 2-phenyl isomer content' of the final LAB product may be varied by adjusting the relative amounts of the two catalysts employed and/or the flow rate of reactants over each catalyst. For a given desired 2-phenyl isomer content of the product, the relative proportions of the two catalysts may vaiy depending on activity of each catalyst, the type and flow rates of the reactants, temperature, pressure and other process variables.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a representative, non-limiting scheme for the practice of this invention. The catalysts, which may be used as a mixture, may be packed in series in the reactor 230 or may be loaded into two reactors aligned in series, are employed in amounts effective to achieve the desired level of 2-phenyl isomer content. If the catalysts are employed in series, whether in the same reactor or in multiple reactors, the amount of the first catalyst in the series is an amount relative to the amount and'or flow rate of the reactants that is insufficient to effect complete conversion of the reactants. The second catalyst may be used in any amount which will complete reaction of the reactants. The fluorine-containing mordenite may be either the first or second catalyst, preferably being in the first bed. Alternatively, reactor 230 may be packed with a mixed bed of the two catalysts.<br>
The scheme of FIG. 3 is shown in the context of LAB alkylation based on a feed from a paraffin dehydrogenation facility. Thus, in FIG. 3 fresh paraffin is fed to a conventional dehydrogenation apparatus 210 via line 211, with recycled paraffin being introduced from the paraffin column 250 via line 252. Dehydrogenated paraffin from the dehydrogenation apparatus 210 is then pumped into an alkylation reactor (or reactors) 230 that contains the fluorine-containing mordenite and a second, solid alkylation catalyst. The dehydrogenated paraffin feed may of course be supplied from any provider. The source of dehydrogenated paraffin (olefin) is not critical to the practice of this invention. LAB product from alkylation unit 230 may thereafter be purified by a series of distillation towers.<br><br><br>
purification. Further, the particular purification scheme used is not critical to the practice of this invention. The scheme depicted in FIG. 3 is instead representative of a typical commercial operation. In FIG. 3, unreacted benzene is distilled off from the crude LAB product. Benzene is then recycled to the alkylation reactor 230. The benzene-free LAB crude product from the benzene column 240 is pumped through line 241 to-paraffin-column 250 where any paraffin present is distilled off, with the distilled paraffin being recycled to paraffin dehydrogenation unit 210 via line 252. Paraffin-free crude LAB from the paraffin column 250 is transported to a refining column 260 where purified LAB is distilled and removed via line 262. Heavies (e.g., dialkylates and olefin derivatives) are withdrawn from refining column 260 via conduit 261.<br>
It should be appreciated that columns 240, 250, and 260 may be maintained at conditions (e.g., pressure and temperature) well known to those of skill in the art and may be parked with conventional materials if desired.<br>
The conventional LAB catalysts used most frequently are HF alkylation catalysts and aluminum chloride alkylation catalysts. Other alkylation catalysts in use today include, various zeolites, alumina-silica, various clays, as well as other catalysts.<br>
Representative Examples<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention or the claims. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are by weight. In the examples, all reactants were commercial grades and used as received. The apparatus depicted in FIG. 1 was employed for examples 2-4. The apparatus depicted in FIG. 1 was used for example 5.<br>
It may be noted that example 2 illustrates LAB production from paraffin dehydrogenate using the fluoride-treated mordenite catalyst of example B, where good catalyst life (250+ hrs)<br><br>
is achieved without catalyst regeneration, while maintaining a 2-phenyl LAB selectivity of &gt;70% and high LAB productivity without significant loss of fluoride. Comparative example 1, on the other hand, using untreated mordenite, with no fluoride added, shows a rapid decline in LAB production. In addition, examples 3 and 4 illustrate LAB production using a 5:1 molar benzene/C10-CM olefin feed mix and the fluoride-treated mordenite catalysts of Example B when operating at different LHSVs in the range of 0.2-0.4 tar1. Catalyst life may exceed 500 hours. Example 5 illustrates LAB production with the fluoride-treated mordenite catalyst where the alkylation is conducted at higher temperatures and under pressure. Examples 6-8 illustrate the performance of three HF-treated mordenite catalysts with different fluoride loadings. Example 9 shows how virtually no alkylation activity is observed with a highly-fluorinated mordenite.<br>
