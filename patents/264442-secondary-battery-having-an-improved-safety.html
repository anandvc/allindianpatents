SECONDARY BATTERY HAVING AN IMPROVED SAFETY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a secondary battery<br>
5 capable of improving the safety thereof and a safety device<br>
used for the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, secondary batteries are rechargeable<br>
10 batteries, which can be fabricated in a compact size or a<br>
large size. For instance, the secondary batteries include<br>
Ni-MH batteries, lithium batteries and lithium ion<br>
batteries. In addition, the secondary batteries are<br>
classified into cylindrical secondary batteries and square<br>
15 type secondary batteries according to the external<br>
appearances thereof.<br>
Different from a pouch type secondary battery, the<br>
cylindrical secondary battery or the square type secondary<br>
battery includes a battery can serving as a positive<br>
20 electrode terminal or a negative electrode terminal and an<br>
electrode assembly accommodated in the battery can and<br>
including a positive electrode (cathode) coated with a<br>
positive electrode active material, a negative electrode<br>
(anode) coated with a negative electrode active material,<br>
25 and a separator interposed between the positive and negative<br>
electrodes.<br>
Meanwhile, if a sharp tool, such as a nail or a drill<br>
tip, penetrates the positive and negative electrodes coated<br>
with active materials by passing through the battery can or<br>
30 if the battery can is pressed by means of a pressing tool,<br>
such as a nipper, an internal short circuit may occur<br>
between the positive and negative electrodes, so a great<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
amount of current is applied between the positive and<br>
negative electrodes while generating heat. In an extreme<br>
case, the battery is subject to accidental ignition or<br>
explosion. For this reason, a safety device is provided in<br>
5 the battery in order to prevent the accidental ignition or<br>
explosion of the battery.<br>
For instance, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication<br>
No. 2000-48852 discloses a safety device for a secondary<br>
battery as shown in FIG. 1, wherein the safety device is<br>
10 provided at the outermost portion of an electrode assembly<br>
in the form of a jelly-roll, which is accommodated in a<br>
battery can of a cylindrical battery, by extending uncoated<br>
positive and negative electrodes, on which the active<br>
materials are not coated, by a predetermined length,. The<br>
15 battery can is electrically insulated from the uncoated<br>
positive electrode or the uncoated negative electrode by<br>
means of a separator and the battery can may serve as a<br>
positive electrode terminal or a negative electrode terminal<br>
of the battery.<br>
20 According to the above prior art, if the sharp tool<br>
penetrates the electrode assembly through the battery can,<br>
the short circuit occurs between the uncoated positive and<br>
negative electrodes having a relatively lower resistance,<br>
and also the short circuit occurs between the positive; and<br>
25 negative electrodes having a relatively higher resistance,<br>
which are formed with active materials. At this time, short<br>
current may primarily flow between the uncoated positive and<br>
negative electrodes having a relatively lower resistance, so<br>
that an amount of current applied to the positive and<br>
30 negative electrodes having the active materials is reduced.<br>
Thus, the battery can be safely maintained even if the<br>
internal short circuit occurs in the battery, thereby<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
preventing heat from being suddenly generated and the<br>
temperature from suddenly rising in the battery.<br>
However, according to the above-mentioned conventional<br>
cylindrical battery, the short circuit may occur only when<br>
5 the sharp tool, such as a nail or a drill tip, penetrates<br>
the uncoated positive and negative electrodes after passing<br>
through the battery can, so that charged current in the<br>
battery can may not be rapidly discharged to the exterior<br>
while the sharp tool is penetrating into the battery can.<br>
10 In addition, the uncoatsd positive and negative<br>
electrodes are aligned adjacent to the positive and negative<br>
electrodes coated with the active materials and the uncoated<br>
positive and negative electrodes have the thickness<br>
relatively smaller than that of the battery can. Thus, if<br>
15 the sharp tool introduced into the battery can any further<br>
moves toward the positive and negative electrodes ooated<br>
with the active materials and penetrates the positive and<br>
negative electrodes, high-temperature heat may be suddenly<br>
generated in the battery can, so that the battery is subject<br>
20 to accidental ignition or explosion.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to<br>
solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior<br>
art, and an object of the present invention is to ensure the<br>
5 safety of a cylindrical battery or a square type battery<br>
from external parameters, such as penetration of a sharp<br>
tool (e.g. a nail or a drill tip), pressing force of a tool<br>
(e.g. a nipper), external impact, and exposure to the high<br>
temperature. In detail, the object of the present invention<br>
10 is to generate an external short circuit at the exterior of<br>
the battery can while the external parameters are being<br>
applied to the battery can, so that charged current in the<br>
secondary battery can be sufficiently discharged from the<br>
secondary battery before the external parameters exert a bad<br>
15 influence upon the secondary battery (e.g. an internal short<br>
circuit in an electrode assembly accommodated in the battery<br>
can) . Thus, the safety of the secondary battery can be<br>
ensured even if an internal short circuit occurs between a<br>
positive electrode and a negative electrode of the secondary<br>
20 battery caused by the external parameters.<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the present<br>
invention provides a secondary battery comprising: a battery<br>
can serving as a positive electrode terminal or a negative<br>
electrode terminal of the secondary battery; an electrically<br>
25 conductive substrate provided at an outer portion of the<br>
battery can; and a nonconductive film interposed between the<br>
battery can and the electrically conductive substrate in<br>
order to insulate the electrically conductive substrate from<br>
the battery can, wherein the electrically conductive<br>
30 substrate is electrically connected to an electrode terminal<br>
having polarity opposite to that of the battery can.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
invention, the electrically conductive substrate is attached<br>
to an inner wall of a nonconductive hard casing, and the<br>
nonconductive hard casing surrounds at least a part of the<br>
secondary battery in a state in which a part of two<br>
5 electrode terminals is exposed to an exterior.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a safety<br>
device provided at an outer portion of a battery can serving<br>
as a positive electrode terminal or a negative electrode<br>
terminal of a secondary battery, wherein the safety device<br>
10 includes an electrically conductive substrate provided at<br>
one side thereof with a nonconductive film.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
15 in detail.<br>
In a secondary battery using positive electrode active<br>
materials, such as lithium containing metal oxides capable<br>
of storing and discharging lithium and/or lithium ions,<br>
lithium is de-intercalated from the positive electrode<br>
20 active materials when the secondary battery is charged, so<br>
that the positive electrode active materials enter a<br>
thermally unstable state. In this state, if an internal<br>
short circuit occurs in the secondary battery caused by<br>
external parameters, such as penetration of a sharp tool,<br>
25 pressing force of a tool (e.g. a nipper), external impact,<br>
and exposure to the high temperature, the internal<br>
temperature of the secondary battery may rise. If the<br>
internal temperature of the secondary battery reaches a<br>
critical temperature, the structure of the positive<br>
30 electrode active materials remaining under the thermally<br>
unstable state may be broken, so that oxygen may be<br>
generated from the positive electrode active materials. Such<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
oxygen may react with an electrolyte solvent while<br>
generating heat, so that exothermic reactions may<br>
consecutively occur in the secondary battery. Thus, the<br>
 safety of the secondary battery cannot be ensured.<br>
5 The present invention is characterized by generating<br>
an external short circuit at the exterior of a battery can<br>
while the external parameters are being applied to the<br>
battery can, so that charged current in the secondary<br>
battery can be sufficiently discharged from the secondary<br>
10 battery before the external parameters exert a bad influence<br>
upon the secondary battery (e.g. an internal short circuit<br>
in an electrode assembly accommodated in the battery can).<br>
Thus, the safety of the secondary battery can be ensured<br>
even if an internal short circuit occurs between a positive<br>
15 electrode and a negative electrode of the secondary battery<br>
caused by the external parameters. In order to generate the<br>
external short circuit at the exterior of the battery can,<br>
an electrically conductive substrate is installed at an<br>
outer portion of the battery can, which serves as a positive<br>
20 electrode terminal or a negative electrode terminal of the<br>
secondary battery, while interposing a nonconductive film<br>
therebetween, in such a manner that the electrically<br>
conductive substrate is electrically connected to an<br>
electrode terminal having polarity opposite to that of the<br>
25 battery can.<br>
FIG. 2 is a partially schematic sectional view<br>
illustrating a secondary battery according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention and FIG. 3 is a<br>
partially schematic sectional view illustrating the<br>
30 secondary battery according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, in which a nail partially penetrates into<br>
the secondary battery.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a safety device 1 of the present<br>
invention includes an electrically conductive substrate 2<br>
having a nonconductive film 2a at one side thereof. The<br>
safety device 1 is provided at an outer portion of a battery<br>
5 can serving as a positive electrode terminal or a negative<br>
electrode terminal of the secondary battery. At this time, a<br>
nonconductive wrapping member surrounding the battery can<br>
may be used as the nonconductive film forming a part of the<br>
safety device 1. Accordingly, the electrically conductive<br>
10 substrate 2 can be installed at the outer portion of the<br>
battery can in a state in which the nonconductive film is<br>
directly attached to the battery can, or the electrically<br>
conductive substrate 2 can be installed at the outer portion<br>
of the battery can in a state in which the nonconductive<br>
15 film is attached to one side of the electrically conductive<br>
substrate 2.<br>
According to the secondary battery of the present<br>
invention, the safety device 1 is provided at the outer<br>
portion of the battery can, so that a short circuit occurs<br>
20 at the outer portion of the battery can when a nail or a<br>
drill tip penetrating the electrically conductive substrate<br>
2 of the safety device 1 makes contact with the battery can.<br>
However, according to the conventional secondary battery, an<br>
uncoated positive electrode and an uncoated negative<br>
25 electrode serving as a safety device are provided in the<br>
battery can while interposing a separator therebetween, so<br>
the short circuit may not occur while the nail or the drill<br>
tip is penetrating into the battery can, but the short<br>
circuit may occur when the nail or the drill tip penetrates<br>
30 both the uncoated positive electrode and the uncoated<br>
negative electrode.<br>
In addition, the battery can has a thickness of about<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
200 to l000μm, which is larger than that (10 to 20μm) of a<br>
separator. Accordingly, when it is assumed that the nail or<br>
the drill tip penetrates into the secondary battery with the<br>
same penetration force in both the present invention and the<br>
5 prior art, the time interval of the present invention from<br>
an external short circuit between the battery can and the<br>
electrically conductive substrate of the safety device<br>
installed at the outer portion of the battery can to the<br>
internal short circuit between the positive electrode and<br>
10 the negative electrode coated with active materials and<br>
installed in the battery can while interposing the separator<br>
therebetween, that is "(thickness of battery can + thickness<br>
of separator)/ penetration speed" is significantly longer<br>
than the time interval of the prior art employing the<br>
15 uncoated positive/negative electrodes as a safety device,<br>
from the first short circuit between the uncoated positive<br>
electrode and the uncoated negative electrode to the second<br>
short circuit between the positive electrode and the<br>
negative electrode coated with the active materials, that is<br>
20 "thickness of separator / penetration speed". Therefore, in<br>
the secondary battery according to the present invention,<br>
the more charged current corresponding to the increase of<br>
the time interval can be discharged out of the secondary<br>
battery through the external short circuit, thereby changing<br>
25 the status of the secondary battery from the charge state to<br>
the discharge state, in which the positive electrode active<br>
materials remain in a stable state. Thus, in the secondary<br>
battery according to the present invention, even if the nail<br>
or the drill tip penetrate into the battery can, the<br>
30 separator, the positive electrode and the negative electrode<br>
and thus the internal short circuit occurs, heat is rarely<br>
generated in the secondary battery, thereby preventing<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
accidental ignition or explosion of the secondary battery<br>
(see, FIG. 3).<br>
Meanwhile, in a normal state of the secondary battery<br>
in. which the nail or the drill tip does not penetrate into<br>
5 the secondary battery, the same voltage is applied to the<br>
electrically conductive substrate 2 and the electrode<br>
terminal connected to the electrically conductive substrate<br>
2, so that current does not flow between the electrically<br>
conductive substrate 2 and the electrode terminal even if a<br>
10 terminal of an electronic appliance (not shown) or a<br>
conductive member makes contact with the positive and<br>
negative electrode terminals of the secondary battery (see,<br>
FIG. 2).<br>
In addition, it is preferred if the nonconductive film<br>
15 2a is melted under a predetermined temperature. In this<br>
case, when the internal temperature of the secondary battery<br>
rises by exposure to the high temperature, the nonconductive<br>
 film 2a is melted prior to explosion of the secondary<br>
battery, thereby causing the external short circuit between<br>
20 the electrically conductive substrate 2 and the battery can<br>
in the same manner as when the nail or the drill tip<br>
penetrates into the secondary battery from the exterior of<br>
the secondary battery.<br>
Preferably, the melting point of the nonconductive<br>
25 film 2a is about 100 to 200oC.<br>
The nonconductive film 2a is made from polyolefin-<br>
based resin, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or<br>
copolymer thereof.<br>
It is preferred if the electrically conductive<br>
30 substrate 2 has superior heat conductivity and heat-<br>
resistant characteristics.<br>
The electrically conductive substrate 2 can be made<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
from metals having electric conductivity or alloys thereof.<br>
Preferably, the electrically conductive substrate 2 is made<br>
from at least one selected from the group consisting of Al,<br>
 Cu, Ni, Sn, stainless steel and carbon sheet having superior<br>
5 electric conductivity and heat conductivity.<br>
The electrically conductive substrate 2 is preferably<br>
fabricated in the form of a long strip having a<br>
predetermined thickness. In addition,. the electrically<br>
conductive substrate 2 preferably surrounds the secondary <br>
10 battery except for a part of the positive electrode terminal<br>
and the negative electrode terminal, in such a manner that<br>
the charged current in the secondary battery cam be<br>
sufficiently introduced into the electrically conductive<br>
substrate 2 provided at the outer portion of the battery can<br>
15 for preventing heat from being generated in the secondary<br>
battery when the nail or the drill tip penetrates into the<br>
secondary battery.<br>
In addition, a polymer resin layer (not shown) can be<br>
provided at an outer portion of the electrically conductive<br>
20 substrate 2 such that the electrically conductive substrate<br>
2 does not electrically make contact with external devices.<br>
Preferably, the polymer resin layer is made from PET<br>
(Polyethylene Terephthalate) or nylon-based materials ' in<br>
order to protect the battery can while allowing<br>
25 predetermined printing work.<br>
Meanwhile, a secondary battery according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes a nonconductive<br>
hard casing 3 and an electrically conductive substrate 2<br>
attached to an inner wall of the nonconductive hard casing<br>
30 3. The nonconductive hard casing 3 surrounds at least a part<br>
of the secondary battery in a state in which a part of two<br>
electrode terminals is exposed to the exterior. In addition,<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
the electrically conductive substrate 2 is insulated from<br>
the battery can of the secondary battery by means of a<br>
nonconductive film 2a and is electrically connected to an<br>
electrode terminal having polarity opposite to that of the<br>
5 battery can (see, FIG. 8).<br>
Thus, since the nonconductive hard casing is provided<br>
at the outer portion of the secondary battery, the secondary<br>
battery according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention can be more safely protected from sharp tools.<br>
10 The secondary battery. according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention is substantially similar<br>
to the secondary battery according the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention, except that the hard casing, which is<br>
provided at the inner wall thereof with the electrically<br>
15 conductive substrate, is installed at the outer portion of<br>
the battery can serving as the positive electrode terminal<br>
. or the negative electrode terminal of the secondary battery.<br>
Thus, the description related to the operation and structure<br>
of the same or similar elements will be omitted below in<br>
20 order to avoid redundancy.<br>
In addition, according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a plurality of secondary batteries can be<br>
provided in the hard casing in the form of a battery pack so<br>
as to simplify the manufacturing process. If plural<br>
25 secondary batteries are accommodated in one hard casing,<br>
heat can be uniformly distributed to the peripheral area or<br>
exterior through the electrically conductive substrate<br>
attached to the inner wall of the hard casing, even if each<br>
of the secondary batteries irregularly generates heat. For<br>
30 instance, it is preferred when considering the safety of the<br>
secondary battery pack if the temperatures of six batteries<br>
rise from 40 to 50°C, respectively, as compared with when the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
temperature of one battery rises from 40 to 100°C.<br>
The secondary battery according to the present<br>
invention can be fabricated in the form of a cylindrical<br>
battery, a square type battery or other types of batteries<br>
5 if the battery can of the secondary battery may serve as the<br>
negative electrode terminal or the positive electrode<br>
terminal.<br>
The following example is for explaining the safety of<br>
the secondary battery according to the present invention in<br>
10 detail. However, the following example is for illustrative<br>
purposes only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[Example]<br>
Example 1<br>
15 A battery can was made from a metal having a diameter<br>
of 65mm and a height of 18mm. Then, a secondary battery<br>
having a capacity of 2200mAh was prepared with a positive<br>
electrode active material (LiCo02), a negative electrode<br>
active material (carbon), a separator (polymer), and an<br>
20 electrolyte (organic solvent: EC and EMC). At this time, the<br>
battery can served as a negative electrode terminal and a<br>
metallic thin film including a nonconductive film and being<br>
made from aluminum was attached to the outer portion of the<br>
battery can, in such a manner that the metallic thin film<br>
25 was electrically insulated from the battery can and a part<br>
of the metallic thin film was connected to a positive<br>
electrode terminal (see, FIG. 2).<br>
After that, in a state in which the secondary battery<br>
having the above structure was charged with 4.2V, the<br>
30 voltage and the temperature of the secondary battery were<br>
measured while allowing a nail having a diameter of 2mm to<br>
completely penetrate the secondary battery at a speed of<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
l000mm/min. The result is shown in FIG. 4. In addition, in a<br>
state in which the secondary battery was charged with 4.2V,<br>
the voltage and the temperature: of the secondary battery<br>
were measured while allowing a nail having a diameter of 2mm<br>
5 to partially penetrate into the secondary battery from an<br>
exterior by a distance of 8mm and 4mm at a speed of<br>
lOOOmm/min, respectively. The results are shown in FIGS. 6<br>
and 7, respectively.<br>
If the nail partially penetrates into the secondary<br>
10 battery, heat is concentrated onto one spot of the secondary<br>
battery, so it is more dangerous as compared with when the<br>
nail completely penetrates the secondary battery. However,<br>
as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, safety of the secondary battery<br>
fabricated according to the present invention was ensured<br>
15 even if the nail partially penetrated into the secondary<br>
battery.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A battery can was made from a metal having a diameter<br>
of 65mm and a height of 18mm. Then, a secondary battery<br>
20 having a capacity of 2200mAh was prepared with a positive<br>
electrode active material (LiCoO2) , a negative electrode<br>
active material (carbon), a separator (polymer), and an<br>
electrolyte (organic solvent: EC and EMC). After that, an<br>
uncoated positive electrode made from aluminum and an<br>
25 uncoated negative electrode made from copper were wound<br>
around the outermost part of a jelly-roll type electrode<br>
assembly while interposing a separator between the uncoated<br>
positive electrode and the uncoated negative electrode, and<br>
the jelly-roll type electrode assembly was accommodated in<br>
30 the battery can (see, FIG. 1).<br>
Then, in a state in which the secondary battery having<br>
the above structure was charged with 4.2V, the voltage and<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/080687                                                                                          PCT/KR2005/003283<br>
the temperature of the secondary battery were measured while<br>
allowing a nail having a diameter of 2mm to completely<br>
penetrate the secondary battery at a speed of l000mm/min. In<br>
this case, accidental ignition or explosion of the secondary<br>
5 battery occurred (see, FIG. 5).<br>
As described above, the present invention can ensure<br>
safety of the secondary battery even if the secondary<br>
battery is subject to external parameters, such as<br>
penetration of a sharp tool (e.g. a nail or a drill tip),<br>
10 pressing force of a tool (e.g. a nipper), external impact,<br>
and exposure to the high temperature.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been described for illustrative purposes,<br>
those skilled in the art will appreciate that various<br>
15 modifications, additions and substitutions are possible,<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention<br>
as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
