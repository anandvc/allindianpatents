A COMMUNICATION ASSISTANCE SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR<br>
OPERATING SAID SYSTEM<br>
RELATED APPLICATION:<br>
This application is based on and claims priority to U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/345,674 filed on January 2, 2002, entitled,<br>
"Communication Assistance System and Method" the entirety of which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention is directed to a system and method, which allows a<br>
requester to contact a communication apparatus user, and, in particular, to a<br>
system and method which stores and prioritizes past requested listings from a<br>
particular requester.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
One drawback of current directory assistance systems arises when a<br>
requester using the system frequently requests the same information or listing.<br>
In such situations in the present directory assistance systems, the operator needs<br>
to input the search criterion each time the requester makes the request. In this<br>
configuration, a directory assistance operator may be called on to retrieve the<br>
same directory listings several times for the same requester over a period of<br>
time. This leads to a wasteful use of operator time as well as leading to<br>
frustration on the part of the requester who is frequently requesting the same<br>
listing information.<br>
As a result, it is desirable to have a system and method, which permits a<br>
more efficient acquisition of data by a directory assistance operator when a<br>
requester frequently requests the same information listing. It is also desirable to<br>
create a system capable of meaningfully utilizing the frequently requested<br>
listings so as to decrease the listing retrieval time when frequently requested<br>
listings are asked for again. With the advancements in the technology used for<br>
wireless, remote devices, such as cellular phones and PDAs, and the networks<br>
that support them, there is also a need to be able to synchronize data between the<br>
held device and the directory assistance provider so that both can have ready<br>
access to frequently called numbers.<br>
Summary of the Invention;<br>
The present invention advantageously provides a system and method<br>
which facilitates the efficient acquisition of data by a directory assistance<br>
operator when a requester frequently requests the same information listing. The<br>
system is capable of meaningfully utilizing the frequently requested listings by<br>
storing and manipulating the past requested listings of a given requester and<br>
organize and present them to the operator in such a way so as to decrease the<br>
listing retrieval time when frequently requested listings are asked for again.<br>
To this end, a directory assistance system for either land line or wireless<br>
listings employs a requester listing table which tracks a requester"s phone<br>
number and the time and date of the requester"s request. When a listing is<br>
solicited the information is stored in the requester listing table, populated by<br>
information provided by the directory assistance system.<br>
After the requester makes a call to make a request for a listing and prior<br>
to the operator searching for the listing, the directory assistance system searches<br>
a past requested listing table to see if there is a match on the requester phone<br>
number. If so, then the past requested listings are presented to the operator<br>
displaying the requesters phone number, the past requested listings and time and<br>
date information associated with those listings. If the current listing being<br>
requested by the requester is on the screen, the operator can bypass searching for<br>
the listing and instead can directly transfer the requester to the desired listing<br>
thereby saving time for both the operator and the requester.<br>
The past requested listing table is further configured to tabulate the<br>
categories of the stored listings. Such categories may include but is not limited<br>
to recreational, movies, restaurants, commercial stores, 1-800 numbers, airlines,<br>
hotels, taxis and personal numbers. The category designations may be utilized<br>
directly on the past requested listing table or alternatively a top requested listing<br>
sub-table 94 may be provided that further organizes the stored listings by their<br>
respective categories and the number of times they were requested facilitating<br>
faster connection of the requester to the desired listing.<br>

Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention:<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to<br>
like elements, there is shown in Fig. 1, a communication assistance system 2 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. System 2 allows a<br>
requester 4 to initiate communications with device 6, even where requester 4<br>
does not know the identification number of device 6. Device 6 refers to a device<br>
used by a subscriber to a wireless or wireline service, and will be used<br>
throughout the application to refer to the device that the requester 4 intends to<br>
reach. Requesters 4 can access system 2 via a traditional wireline Local<br>
Exchange Carrier (LEC) and/or Inter-Exchange Carrier, via a wireless carrier<br>
(including both voice and data access) or via connection to the Internet. Devices<br>
6 can be any known communication device including cellular telephones and<br>
modems, pagers, PCS phones and modems, RIM Blackberry, wireless PDA,<br>
instant messaging devices, SMS devices and the like.<br>
It is contemplated that the present invention can be implemented to<br>
accommodate any device including land line phones, business phones and<br>
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with voice communication capability, etc.<br>
Subscriber 6 refers to any individual or business entity, whose<br>
information is stored for retrieval by the system. Although Fig. 1 depicts such<br>
subscribers using wireless devices it is appreciated that any communication<br>
information relating to subscriber 6 such as their landline phone number, pager<br>
number, e-mail address, etc. can be stored and retrieved by the system. Also, for<br>
the purposes of illustration, requester 4 refers through out to a requester 4 that<br>
accesses system 2 to seek the information. It is important to note that a repeat<br>
requester 4 may be invited by system 2 to provide their information into system<br>
2 and thus be incorporated into a database containing searchable subscriber 6<br>
listings.<br>
Communication assistance system 2 is preferably coupled to one or more<br>
service providers 26 directly through wireless MSC (Mobile Switching Center) 8<br>
or via public switched telephone network (PSTN) 10.<br>
In general, device 6 communicates with system 2 via Mobile Switching<br>
Center (MSC)s 8 as shown in Fig. 1. Although not shown, it is contemplated<br>
that device 6 can communicate with system 2 via a MSC 8 coupled to PSTN 10.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, system 2 is preferably comprised of one or more<br>
switches and integrated voice response units (VRU) 12 (the VRU may be<br>
standalone instead of integrated as described above), billing databases 14,<br>
primary call centers 16, listing databases 18 and a plurality of operator terminals<br>
20 running agent application 19 accessing enhanced service modules 21 that may<br>
be operated by an agent, closing prompt storage module 13, call completion<br>
table 17, a Wide Area Network 25 (WAN), closing prompt modules 27 coupled<br>
to agent applications 19, a Computer Telephony Interfaces 29 (CTI) and a caller<br>
database 31. In particular, billing database 14 is connected to WAN 25 and can<br>
be coupled to any component of system 2. Units 12 are coupled to Mobile<br>
Switching Centers (MSCs) 8 and PSTN 10 as well as primary call center 16.<br>
Primary call center 16 is also coupled to at least one operator terminal 20 and<br>
listing database 18.<br>
The connection between primary call center 16 and operator terminal 20<br>
is such that voice communication is transmitted directly between the two and<br>
data information is transmitted via computer telephony interface 29. This may<br>
also be accomplished via in-band signaling, as will be discussed below.<br>
Operator terminal 20 is not only connected to the listing database 18 but also to<br>
other databases and software application modules as well.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a plurality of call<br>
centers such as system 2 and system 2", illustrated in Fig. 1, can be strategically<br>
located in various geographic locations across the country. For example, each<br>
call center, system 2 or system 2" can be located in a major metropolitan area<br>
spread across the United States. Each call center is configured to handle the call<br>
traffic that is designated for that call center which could include all possible type<br>
of calls.<br>
In operation, primary call center 16" receives forwarded calls from<br>
primary call center 16 in the case where system 2 is experiencing operational<br>
problems or a volume of requests that exceed its capacity. In addition, it is<br>
possible through intelligent pre-routing within the network to automatically<br>
deliver the call to primary call center 16". An important benefit provided by this<br>
arrangement is that the primary call center 16" of system 2" is able to act as an<br>
overflow unit for primary call center 16 of system 2 in the event that system 2 is<br>
experiencing technical difficulties or high call volume. This.configuration<br>
allows primary call center 16 to route calls to primary call center 16" during<br>
periods of high volume, even in the event of a breakdown in the primary direct<br>
connections of system 2 as described above.<br>
Another component of system 2 or 2" is call completion table 17. Call<br>
completion table 17 allows switch 12 to select an outbound trunk group that can<br>
most efficiently route the call to the end destination. For example, if requester 4<br>
requests a traditional directory assistance listing (i.e. a wireline business or<br>
residential listing), service provider 26 of requester 4 may prefer to complete<br>
these calls on their own network. In this case call completion table 17 would<br>
select an outbound trunk group to service provider 26 of requester 4. In the case<br>
where requester 4 requests a listing of a device 6, it may be more desirable to<br>
complete the call via the network of the service provider 26 of the device 6. In<br>
this case call completion table 17 would select a direct outbound trunk group to<br>
service provider 26 of device 6.<br>
Call completion table 17 also allows for the programming of multiple<br>
outbound routes for each call depending on, but not limited to, the time of day,<br>
the service provider 26 of the requester 4, the service provider 26 of device 6,<br>
corresponding rates for each service provider 26 and time of the day and the<br>
NPA/NXX of the destination.<br>
Listing database 18 and listing database 18" are similarly arranged, and<br>
are preferably mirror images of one another. Although operator terminal 20 is<br>
not shown directly coupled to primary call center 16" and listing database 18",<br>
operator terminals 20 can be so coupled via WAN 25, or can access call center<br>
16" and database 18" via primary call center 16 as shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.<br>
This overcomes situations where database 18 is down in system 2, such that<br>
operator terminal 20 completes the call using information stored on database 18".<br>
The links coupling the various components of system 2 together and with<br>
service providers 26 via Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 8 and Public Switched<br>
Telephone Network (PSTN) 10 can be any known voice and/or data<br>
communication technologies, including wide area networking and local area<br>
networking communication technologies, for example, digital subscriber lines<br>
(DSL), digital T-1s, leased lines, satellite or wireless links, Integrated Services<br>
Digital Network (ISDN) circuits, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), Ethernet,<br>
token ring, fiber distributed-data interface (FDDI) and the like. It is also<br>
presumed that the various components of system 2, service providers 26 and<br>
PSTN 10 are arranged with appropriate communication hardware interfaces to<br>
transmit and receive data across the communication links.<br>
For example, wireless service providers 26 may interface directly with<br>
system 2 via Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 8 hardware coupled directly to<br>
Switch 12 of system 2. Switches 12 can be any switches that preferably include<br>
an integrated voice response unit. Many functions performed by switches 12 are<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include telephone call routing<br>
between trunks, converting one signaling type to another, such as between a<br>
digital signaling system, dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, multi-<br>
frequency (MF) signaling, ISDN, SS7, etc., and capturing call length and<br>
destination data for billing, etc.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, when a call comes into Switch 12, the call is<br>
identified by a DNIS which relates to the number dialed by the requester, so that<br>
appropriate data generated by system 2, such as call completion data packets 50<br><br>
(Fig. 5), can be routed to the correct switch 12 to complete the call, as will be<br>
explained in more detail hereinafter.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a closing prompt storage module 13 is configured to<br>
store a variety of closing prompt messages and data, such that when the switch<br>
12 completes the call from requester 4 to device 6, switch 12 can play any one of<br>
a variety of closing prompts based on the information received from a call<br>
completion data packet 50 as will be explained in more detail. Although only<br>
one switch 12 is illustrated in Fig. 1, any number of switches 12 can be used in<br>
system 2 to increase the capacity of system 2.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an Incoming call information record 15 provided by<br>
switch 12, after switch 12 receives a call from requester 4, record 15 is sent to<br>
primary call center 16.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, Incoming<br>
call information record 15 contains a number of fields which may include but is<br>
not limited to: number dialed by requester field, preferred language code field,<br>
originating phone number of requester field and requester service provider field<br>
and feature code field.<br>
The number dialed by requester field contains the number dialed by<br>
requester 4 and may be used to identify the originating switch location of the<br>
incoming call.<br>
The preferred language code field contains information indicating the<br>
language preference of requester 4. System 2, and in particular switch 12,<br>
maintains the ability to translate many different dial strings into system 2. One<br>
possibility for determining the preferred language of requester 4 is to<br>
automatically route calls from a particular dialed number, for example NPA-555-<br>
1818, directly to, for example, Spanish speaking operators. Another possibility is<br>
to route the call using information stored on the caller database 31. The<br>
preferred language code field is used to route calls to primary call center 16 via<br>
switch 12 by way of incoming call information record 15.<br>
The originating phone number of the requester field holds the originating<br>
phone number of the requester 4. The requester service provider field conveys<br>
the service provider of requester 4. This field allows system 2 to identify the<br>
calling party"s service provider 26 for use with various functions such as<br>
introduction prompts, closing prompts, billing information, usage tracking, etc.<br>
One example of a use of this data is to allow for the settlement of billing charges<br>
between the service provider 26 of requester 4 and service provider 26 of device<br>
6.<br>
The feature code field holds information that can be used to identify any<br>
special features associated with requester 4"s device. These features could<br>
include, but are not limited to: promotional rate plans, standard rate plans,<br>
bundled service plans, device capabilities and the like. For example, service<br>
provider 26 may offer unlimited directory assistance for a flat fee per month, or<br>
could offer services free for a promotional period.<br>
Although only five fields are identified for incoming call information<br>
record 15, any number of fields that are used to provide system 2 with the<br>
necessary data to complete a call is within the contemplation of this invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, billing database 14 is used as the repository for the<br>
billing data and includes but is not limited to: records which are preferably<br>
comprised of the call date, the call start time, the call end time and the resulting<br>
time, i.e. the call length, the originating phone number for requester 4, the listing<br>
information for device 6 and fields which identify the originating and<br>
terminating service providers. The billing data can be accumulated from any of,<br>
but not limited to, the following: switches 12, ACDs, PBXs, agent application 19<br>
and/or database 18.<br>
Call centers 16 and 16" are comprised of hardware and software which<br>
accept inbound calls from switches 12 and which distribute the calls to multiple<br>
operator terminals 20 using standard Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)<br>
technology. Operator terminal 20 interacts with database 18 to search for and<br>
retrieve a listing corresponding to device 6. The search can be done using a<br>
single field or combination of fields, defined in tables 52A through 52E as<br>
discussed below.<br>
Call center 16 and 16" can be comprised of one or more processors<br>
coupled together in a networked arrangement to accomplish these functions, and<br>
can be constructed using known computing technology such as using personal<br>
computers, mini or mainframe computing devices, routers, switches and the like.<br>
Because the arrangement and operation of call centers 16 and 16" are similar,<br>
discussion of primary call center 16 is understood to also describe primary call<br>
center 16".<br>
Computer Telephony Interface (CTI) 29 is disposed between call center<br>
16 and operator terminal 20. CTI 29 is configured to route the data portion of an<br>
incoming requester 4 call, such as the number dialed by the requester and the<br>
originating phone number of the requester to operator terminal 20, while the<br>
voice portion of the call is transmitted directly between call center 16 and<br>
operator terminal 20. While not discussed here, it is contemnlated within the<br>
context of this invention that the data portion of an incoming requester 4 call<br>
could be sent to operator terminal 20 using in-band signaling (i.e., with the voice<br>
path of the call) as well.<br>
Operator terminal 20 can also be any known computing device capable of<br>
receiving and displaying data on its display, including but not limited to a<br>
personal computer, UNIX workstation and the like. Although it is preferred that<br>
a separate customer service representative telephone be implemented as part of<br>
system 2 and coupled to primary call center 16 for communicating with<br>
requester 4, operator terminal 20 is not limited to this arrangement. For<br>
example, operator terminal 20 can be arranged to contain an integrated telephone<br>
(as shown). In other words, any arrangement that allows a customer service<br>
representative to engage in oral communications with requester 4 is sufficient.<br>
In addition, although only a single operator terminal 20 is shown, system 2 is not<br>
limited to this arrangement. It is contemplated that system 2 is comprised of<br>
multiple operator terminals 20 such that more than one customer service<br>
representative is available to accommodate the users of system 2. It should be<br>
noted that primary call center 16 and its communication with switches 12,<br>
operator terminal 20 and database 18 as well as the arrangement and<br>
communication between primary call center 16" and switches 12" can be<br>
implemented in accordance with the connectivity and communication techniques<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,404,884 issued on June 11, 2002, the contents of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. In an alternate embodiment of this<br>
invention it is contemplated that a requester 4 may interact with an agent using a<br>
non-voice method such as, but not limited to: Short Messaging Service (SMS),<br>
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), live chat, and instant messaging as will<br>
be discussed below.<br>
Agent application 19 platform is used to operate operator terminals 20<br>
and databases 18. This system not only supports the communications between<br>
these modules but also prepares a call completion data packet 50 that is to be<br>
sent to switch 12 to ultimately complete the call.<br>
To create call completion data packet 50, operator terminal 20 and agent<br>
application 19 require information to be retrieved from database 18. This data is<br>
used to populate the various fields of call completion data packet 50 as discussed<br>
in more detail below.<br>
Listing database 18 is preferably any known database system which can<br>
be programmed to store all of but not limited to the following: wireline<br><br>
telephone directory listings, originating service provider 26 of requesters 4<br>
listings, wireless listings and other listings such as providers of goods and<br>
services. Listing database 18 preferably supports multiple database tables for a<br>
voluminous quantity of listings and multimedia data associated with each user or<br>
organization that is sponsoring a group of users.<br>
It should be noted that the present invention augments the database tables<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,404,884 by including several additional fields to<br>
support new features as discussed herein.<br>
Listings database 18 can be based on any known database software and<br>
any known database format. The hardware configuration of listing database 18<br>
can be any hardware platform capable of supporting the quantity of users and<br>
entries in their respective database tables. As such, listing database 18 can be<br>
stored on any device capable of storing the information.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that although database 18<br>
is shown as a single unit, it is not limited to this configuration. Database 18 can<br>
be comprised of multiple hardware units, i.e., central processing units and/or<br>
storage devices such as CD-ROMs, hard disk drives, tape disk drives, etc. which<br>
can communicate with each other across a transmission link. In addition, while<br>
only specific tables and fields within listing database 18 are discussed in detail,<br>
the current invention does not limit the table schema in listing database 18. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention each database in<br>
system 2 or system 2" such as database 18 or 18" stores the same information. In<br>
an alternate embodiment, it is also contemplated that listing database 18 can take<br>
the form of a distributed database. For example, users who are primarily based<br>
on the west coast can be supported from a portion of database such as listing<br>
database 18" located in California, while users primarily located on the east coast<br>
can access a portion of database such as database 18 located in New York.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, listing database 18 stores a<br>
branded audio message associated with the service provider 26 of the requester 4<br>
such that when requester 4 accesses system 2, the audio welcome message is<br>
retrieved by operator terminal 20 and played to the requester 4. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention the audio welcome message may be<br>
retrieved and played on call center 16 or switch 12. This welcome audio message<br>
is discussed in detail below.<br>
Listing database 18 and 18" also contain a connect field as illustrated in<br>
Figure 3. The connect field identifies the degree of availability of the listing for<br>
disclosure. The connect field consists of a connect field sub table listing 70,<br>
which categorizes a number first as either listed or unlisted. If a number is<br>
unlisted it cannot be used to complete a call. However if the number is listed,<br>
connect field sub table listing 70 is further subdivided into "unmasked to agent"<br>
or "masked to agent". In the case of "masked to agent", a call can be completed<br>
but requester 4 does not receive the number. In this case, the number or any<br>
portion thereof may be masked to the agent or customer service representative as<br>
well, such that the agent will not have access to the number, and the call is<br>
simply connected. In the case of "unmasked to agent", the subscriber for device<br>
6 has authorized system 2 to reveal the number to the agent and/or requester 4 as<br>
would most likely be the case for business wireless devices.<br>
It is important to note that in the event requester 4 requests a masked<br>
listing, when that listing is saved in accordance with the past requested listings<br>
features of the present invention, the masked listings will appear on such stored<br>
listings in the masked format as described in more detail in the operation section.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in Fig. 6, a<br>
past requested listing table 92 is provided, and stored for example, in listing<br>
database 18. Table 92 is configured to store information from past requesters 4<br>
and each requester"s corresponding information concerning the requested<br>
listings. Past requested listing table 92 maintains a requester 4 call number field<br>
which relates to the incoming requester 4 number. This field is configured to<br>
associate past requested listings of a particular requester 4 so that system 2 can<br>
identify past requested listings based on individual requesters 4. Past requested<br>
listing table 92 is generated for each requester 4 as soon as they first contact<br>
system 2 and is maintained and updated with each additional call.<br>
It should be noted that past requested listing table 92 is generated by<br>
system 2, stored in database 18, and utilized by operator terminal 20 as<br>
suggested above, however this is intended only as an example of one<br>
configuration to store table 92 and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
For example, past requested listing table 92 may be stored in system 2<br>
and operated directly at the wireless device used by requester 4 via service<br>
provider 26. In such a case, system 2 will generate and store past requested<br>
listing table 92 on a server and then transmit the list via an operable protocol to<br>
requester"s 4 service provider 26 which in turn sends the list to the wireless<br>
device of requester 4.<br>
In this configuration, table 92 may be operated via WAP (Wireless<br>
Application Protocol) or any other compatible protocol capable of interfacing<br>
with system 2 and communicating the desired listing to be connected to. This<br>
configuration provides even faster service for connection to the desired links in<br>
the event the desired listing is contained in past requested listing table and is<br>
particularly effective in wireless communication devices with memory sufficient<br>
to operate the necessary protocol to interface with system 2. This allows a<br>
requester 4 to search through past requested listing table 92 on their own<br>
wireless device after they turn on their device and the list is updated by system 2<br>
as discussed in more detail below.<br>
Past requested listing table 92 also maintains a listing requested field<br>
which corresponds to the subscriber 6 information requested by a particular<br>
requester 4. The listing time and date field, associated with the listing requested<br>
field, stores the last time and date that a listing was requested. A counter field is<br>
also maintained, associated with requested listing field, tracking the number of<br>
times that a particular listing was requested by a requester 4.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, past requested listing table<br>
92 is configured to store past requested listings for a set amount of time with the<br>
presumption that numbers that have not been dialed for a long time are less<br>
likely to be requested again. For example, past requested listing table 92 may<br>
have a storage time frame of 90 days where each of the listings on table 92 have<br>
been requested at least once within the last 90 days by requester 4.<br>
Furthermore, this time frame may be modified as the number of times a<br>
particular listing was requested. For example, the base time frame for past<br>
requested listing table 92 may be 90 days for listings requested once. However,<br>
if a particular listing has been requested three times, past requested listing table<br>
92 may hold this listing for 180 days with the expectation that this listing will be<br>
more likely to be requested again in the future than a listing that was only<br>
requested once.<br>
Another possible method of altering the duration for which a particular<br>
listing is stored on past requested listing table 92, is to reset the 90 day storage<br>
period each time a listing is requested. In this configuration if a listing is<br>
requested a second time within the initial 90 day storage period the storage<br>
period is reset and the listing is stored for another 90 days. It is under stood that<br>
any number of possible storage designs are possible for the listings of past<br>
requested listing table 92 such that the table is effective at reducing the amount<br>
of time required by operator terminal 20 to reduce the time required to retrieve<br>
the desired listing.<br>
In this respect, past requested listing table 92 is designed to maintain a<br>
number of the past requested listing for a particular requester 4 such that it<br>
provides the operator terminal 20 a number of past requested listings sufficient<br>
to expedite a number of requests without having to sift through an undue number<br>
of outdated listings.<br>
One such standard for maintaining sufficient listings on past requested<br>
listing table 92 for a given requester 4 is to store enough listings such that<br>
approximately 20% of requester 4 calls can be completed from the list. In order<br>
to achieve this desired percentage rate various methods of manipulating the<br>
number of listings stored on past requested listing table 92 may be utilized. For<br>
example, as discussed above the storage delay of 90 days may be adjusted up to<br>
120 days or down to 45 days until an appropriate number of listings are stored<br>
on past requested listing table 92.<br>
Another method to manage the listings of past requested listing table 92<br>
may be to adjust the storage times based on the categories of the stored listings.<br>
For example, listings on the category of hotels and airlines may be stored for<br>
only 30 days under the theory that these numbers will not be contacted again for<br>
a long time, whereas personal contact listings may be stored for 180 days<br>
because they are more frequently requested.<br>
Yet another possible method of reaching the desired 20% completion<br>
mark is to set a maximum or minimum number of listings to be stored on past<br>
requested listing table 92.<br>
In the case of a minimum, system 2 may add listings to past requested<br>
listing table 92 when the table is low on listings by methods such as adding<br>
additional nearby movie theaters when a first movie theater is requested in<br>
attempt to predict possible listings. Alternatively, in the case of maximums, as<br>
the number of listings on past requested listing table 92 reaches a higher number<br>
certain listings in categories such as hotels and airlines may be dropped early<br>
(before their storage time period has expired) in order to maintain the efficiency<br>
of past requested table 92.<br>
In any event the goal of past requested listing table 92 is to decrease the<br>
amount of time necessary to retrieve the desired listings. To this end, system 2<br>
attempts to maintain a number of listings on past requested listing table 92 such<br>
that, for example, 20% of a requested listing by requester 4 may be connected to<br>
by operator terminal 20 via table 92.<br>
If too many listing are contained on past requested listing table 92 the <br>
time for operator terminal 20 to search through all of the listings on table 92<br>
would defeat the purpose of having the table in the first place. If too few listings<br>
are maintained on table 92 the need to continuously search through the full<br>
database 18 (to retrieve the listings requested not contained on table 92) would<br>
also reduce the retrieval times. As such an optimum number or percentage of<br>
requests to be retrieved from past requested listing table 92 is required to achieve<br>
the desired goal of reduced listing retrieval time.<br>
However, it should be noted that the desired percentage of 20% of the<br>
requested listings to be retrived from past requested listing table 92 is intended<br>
only as an example and in no way limits the scope of the present invention. For<br>
example, the percentage can be adjusted up or down depending on the<br>
consistency or inconsistency in requests from that particular requester 4 as<br>
explained hereafter.<br>
For example, if requester 4 frequently requests listings from a small<br>
group of listings the target percentage of calls to be completed from information<br>
contained on past requested listing table 92 can be adjusted upwardly to 30% or<br>
40% by utilizing the parameters discussed above so as to further increase the<br>
efficiency for the request retrieval times. Alternatively, if requester 4 is<br>
frequently requesting random listings the target percentage may be lowered to<br>
10-15%, again adjusting the parameters discussed above, so that past requested<br>
listing table 92 does not become cluttered with too many extraneous listings.<br>
The focus of reduction the retrieval times for listings requested by a requester 4<br>
is always the determining factor in adjusting the parameters of past requested<br>
listing table 92.<br>
In any event, it should be noted that all of the parameters discussed above<br>
for the settings for past requested listing table 92 described above are intended<br>
only as example of possible settings used by system and are in now way<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Any such parameters may<br>
be used alone or in combination for past requested listing table 92 such that the<br>
result is an increase in efficiency in retrieving listings requested by a requester 4<br>
who contacts system 2 frequently.<br>
The information contained in the fields of past requested listing table 92<br>
can be organized in many different variations. For example, the listing requested<br>
field may include a separate entry for each time a request was made or,<br>
alternatively, it may maintain a single entry for each requested listing and<br>
tabulate the number of times that the listing was requested in the counter field.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in Fig. 6, past<br>
requested listing table 92 maintains a category field for storing the category of<br>
retrieved listings. For example, if a requester 4 calls for a restaurant listing the<br>
entry will be stored in past requested listing table 92 and the category field will<br>
hold a restaurant notation for that entry. Likewise, if requester 4 requests a gas<br>
station, a gas station or general services notation will be entered next to the<br>
listing in the category field.<br>
The categories filed designations may include but are not limited to<br>
recreational, movies, restaurants, commercial stores, 1-800 numbers, airlines,<br>
hotels, taxis and personal numbers. This list is intended only as an example of<br>
possible methods by which category information may be designated and is in no<br>
way intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Any category<br>
designation used to populate the category field of past requested listing table 92<br>
is within the contemplated of the present invention.<br>
A category ranking field is also provided in past requested listing table<br>
92 such that for each listing having a particular category designation stored in<br>
the category filed, a corresponding category rank is attributed to that listing. For<br>
example, if a particular requester 4 had requested three different restaurant<br>
listings; the first restaurant 4 times, the second restaurant 3 times and the third<br>
restaurant 1 time, then they would be ranked in their category ranks one, two and<br>
three respectively. This information for rank can be generated by system 2 using<br>
the combination of information from the category and counter fields or it can be<br>
generated independently using other criterion.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in Fig. 6k, a<br>
top ranked requests sub-table 94 is provided, configured to organize listings<br>
based on the information contained in the category field and the category rank<br>
field. Top ranked listing sub-table 94 may contain several fields based on<br>
categories of requests stored in past requested listing table 92 such as those<br>
discussed above.<br>
For example, top ranked request table 94 may have a restaurants field, a<br>
personal contacts field, a 1-800 number filed and any other category that is<br>
frequently requested by a particular requester 4. Each of the fields in table 94<br>
maintains listings of the top ranked listings for each categoiy from listing table<br>
92, further facilitating the retrieval of listings by operator terminal 20.<br>
For example, the restaurant field of top ranked request table 94 lists the<br>
top five requested restaurant listings from past requested listing table 92 as<br>
identified by the category rank field. Likewise, the personal contacts field of<br>
topped ranked request table 94 lists the top five requested personal listings from<br>
past requested listing table 92 and so on for each of the categories. This number<br>
of ranked category listings stored in the various fields of top ranked request table<br>
94 list is intended only as an example of possible methods and amounts of<br>
listings of category information that may be used to improve the listing retrieval<br>
time of system 2 and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention. Any number of listings or type of categories used in top ranked<br>
request table 94 is contemplated by the present invention.<br>
It should also be noted that topped ranked listing table 94 may be<br>
manifest in separate tables as illustrated in Fig. 6A, however this is intended<br>
only as one possible method improving listing retrieval time using the rankings<br>
of categories. For example, another means for utilizing the category rankings<br>
field information from past requested listing table 92 is to highlight the topped<br>
ranked listings for each category directly in past requested listing table 92 so as<br>
to draw attention to them at operator terminal 20 enhancing the listing retrieval<br>
time (not pictured). Any similar method that operates by drawing attention to<br>
the top ranked requested listings for each category is within the contemplation of<br>
the present invention.<br>
If all requests are stored, the time and date of each request is stored for<br>
each request. If one entry for each listing is stored, the time and date of the last<br>
request for that listing could be stored. It should be noted that a large number of<br>
combinations for storing information in the past requested listing table 92 are<br>
available to the operator of system 2 which are too numerous to discuss in detail.<br>
For illustration purposes, the description used to illustrate the embodiments of<br>
system 2 show past requested listing table 92 maintaining a single entry for each<br>
listing and an entry in the counter field for each time the request was made.<br>
After the system determines that a requester 4 is a repeat caller and<br>
system 2 searches database 18 for the appropriate past requested listing table 92<br>
the information is placed on the screen of operator terminal 20 as will be<br>
discussed in more detail below in the operation section.<br>
Both past requested listing table 92 and top ranked listing table 94 need<br>
to be updated and repopulated on frequent basis using information collected<br>
from the other components of system 2. Past requested listing table 92 and<br>
topped ranked request table 94 can be repopulated daily, hourly or in real-time.<br>
The selection of rate for repopulation may be determined for maximum<br>
efficiency in system from a systems operation perspective or as determined by a<br>
sample of necessary update times to properly function a list for a given requester<br>
4 or possibly a combination of both.<br>
In the event table 92 is maintained in a server for wireless carriers 26 to<br>
be resent to the wireless devices of requester 4 as discussed above, then table 92<br>
may be updated accordingly. For example, the server for service provider 26<br>
may be updated as discussed above on daily, hourly or real time basis and the list<br>
as manifest on the wireless device of requester 4 may be updated when requester<br>
4 turns off/on their wireless device or some other similar available time frame.<br>
The wireless device, in that event, stores a corresponding copy of table 92. The<br>
wireless device user can men retrieve a listing without making a call for a<br>
directory assistance. If the requested listing is not present in the copied table 92,<br>
the wireless device user will then call the directory assistance. In that event, the<br>
directory assistance may not search past requested listing table 92, based on the<br>
assumption that the requester has already attempted to retrieve the number from<br>
the copy of the table stored in the wireless device.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, past requested<br>
listing table may be updated manually by requester 4 by directly accessing<br>
system 2 via an interface such as a web site (HTTP), SMS or WAP interfaces or<br>
any other interfaces using compatible protocols.<br>
In operation various billing options for system 2 can be utilized in<br>
connection with the maintenance and operation of past requested listing table 92<br>
as stored in billing database 14. Such billing options may include but are not<br>
limited to, charging for maintaining a past requested listing table 92, charging<br>
for making a connection from past requested listing table 92, charging additional<br>
fees based on the rate of updating the table 92, charges based on expanded<br>
content for table 92 and charges for maintaining the service to be operated from<br>
the wireless device of requester 4 through service provider 26.<br>
It should be noted that this list is intended only as an example of possible<br>
billing arrangements for system 2 related to past requested listing table 92 and is<br>
in no way intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Any billing<br>
arrangement related to past requested listing table or combination of past<br>
requested listing table 92 and other features of system 2 are within the<br>
contemplation of the present invention.<br>
Closing prompt module 27 provides the closing prompt identification<br>
data that will be included in a defined field such as closing prompt code field 58<br>
of the call completion data packet 50 as shown in Fig. 5. As mentioned, call<br>
completion data packet 50 prompts switch 12 with a command to activate the<br>
appropriate closing prompt. Closing prompt module 27 functions in conjunction<br>
with agent application 19 to generate a call completion data packet 50 as more<br>
fully described below in reference to Fig. 5. Call completion data packet 50<br>
presents information to switch 12 to generate a closing prompt based on closing<br>
prompt code field 58 of the call completion data packet 50, which is recognized<br>
by switch 12. Closing prompt module 27 can either exist as a physically separate<br>
unit or it can exist as a functional module of agent application 19 software.<br>
While one embodiment of the invention has been described above, the<br>
invention contemplates that call completion data packet 50 can be used by any<br>
combination of hardware and software such as: an ACD, a PBX, a standalone<br>
VRU(Voice Response Unit)/ASR(Advanced Speech Recognition), application<br>
software and the like, to generate the closing prompt based on the closing<br>
prompt code field 58 in call completion data packet 50.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, closing prompt module 27 is comprised of a<br>
closing prompt processing module 64, override module 66 and a call completion<br>
data table 68. Call completion data table 68 can either be a separate table within<br>
closing prompt module 27 or it can exist as software that is found in closing<br>
prompt processing module 64. In another embodiment of the current invention,<br>
closing prompt processing module 64 and override module 66 can reside on<br>
Switch 12 or any combination of hardware and software such as: an ACD, a<br>
PBX, a standalone VRU/ASR, application software and the like.<br>
In the case of new requesters 4, closing prompt module 27 may generate<br>
a closing prompt to invite requester 4 to set up a subscriber 6 listing (to be stored<br>
in listing table 52A). This allows system 2 to accumulate a more complete<br>
subscriber 6 database.<br>
Agent application 19 software then creates a call completion data packet<br>
50. Alternatively, closing prompt module 27 or some other application could<br><br>
create call completion data packet 50; however, for the purposes of this<br>
discussion agent application 19 will be forming call completion data packet 50.<br>
As illustrated in Fig 9, call completion data packet 50 is comprised of multiple<br>
data fields. This can include but is not limited to the originating phone number<br>
of requester field 54, the device identification number information field 56,<br>
closing prompt code field 58 and pre-announcement field 59.<br>
Call completion data packet 50 is formed by agent application 19 at<br>
operator terminal 20 using information from Incoming call Information Record<br>
15, listing table 52A from database 18, and closing prompt module 27. This<br>
information is then organized and used to populate the fields of call completion<br>
data packet 50.<br>
The originating phone number field 54 is the originating phone number<br>
of requester 4. The device identification number information field 56 is the<br>
requested listing of subscriber 6. This information is provided to operator<br>
terminal 20 by the retrieved listing from listing database 18. The device<br>
identification information field identifies the proper destination for the<br>
completed call. This information is used to properly connect requester 4 to<br>
device 6. As discussed below the proper listing can be retrieved by operator<br>
terminal 20 by a search or it can be entered directly from information provided<br>
from past requested listing table 92 or top ranked listing sub-table 94 in the case<br>
of a repeated requests.<br>
Closing prompt code field 58 of call completion data packet 50 contains<br>
instructions on which closing prompt to retrieve, use and play for requester 4.<br>
As discussed above, for new requesters 4 closing prompt field 58 of call<br>
completion data packet 50 may contain instructions for a closing prompt directed<br>
to inviting that requester to submit their information to system 2 to create a<br>
subscriber 6 record. Pre-announcement field 59 of call completion data packet<br>
50 denotes to the Voice Response Unit (VRU) whether or not the pre-<br>
announcement feature is activated. If the pre-announcement feature is activated<br>
the VRU will announce requester 4"s identity to device 6 by either voice or text<br>
message so that wireless apparatus 6 can determine whether or not to accept the<br>
call.<br>
When combined, the originating phone number of requester field 54, the<br>
device identification information field 56, the closing prompt code field 58, and<br>
the pre-announcement field 59 contain all of the information needed to initiate<br>
and complete the call, play the appropriate closing and pre-announcement.<br>
Wide Area Network (WAN) 25 is configured to couple all operator<br>
terminals 20 to system 2 and 2". This includes connections between geographic<br>
locations, such that operator terminals 20 located at a call center can connect<br>
with switches 12 at other remote locations. As noted earlier and to be discussed<br>
in more detail below, because primary call center 16 may route calls to remote<br>
operator terminals 20" it is necessary that those operator terminals 20" be able to<br>
communicate back to the originating switch 12 in order to connect to the proper<br>
call. WAN 25 is configured to relay call completion data packet 50 to the<br>
appropriate switch 12 in order to complete requester 4"s call. A more complete<br>
description of the function of WAN 25 within system 2 is discussed below.<br>
Agent application 19, as supported by one of the operator terminals 20,<br>
communicates via operator terminals 20 to any one of the switches 12 with the<br>
combination of systems 2, 2" etc. via Wide Area Network 25 (WAN). WAN 25<br>
allows customer service representatives at operator terminals 20 to transmit a<br>
call completion data packet 50 from operator terminals 20 to any one of switches<br>
12. In the event that agent application 19 is unable to successfully pass call<br>
completion data packet 50 due to any number of reasons including but not<br>
limited to the unavailability of WAN 25 or the rejection of call completion data<br>
packet 50, agent application 19 can initiate call completion using in-band<br>
signaling such a DTMF. This allows agent application 19 to put the caller on soft<br>
hold and pass the destination digits to switch 12 via the same trunk. Switch 12<br>
then accepts the digits and releases the call to call Center 16 and initiates call<br>
completion as described hereinafter.<br>
As part of the call completion process, switch 12 has the ability to select<br>
the optimal trunk group to be used for the completion of requester 4 to<br>
subscriber 6. For example, if switch 12 has a direct connection to the sendee<br>
provider 26 of subscriber 6, the completion of this call would be implemented<br>
over this link.<br>
In the case where switch 12 did not have a direct connection to service<br>
provider 26 of subscriber 6, the completion of this call would be via PSTN 10.<br>
This allows switch 12 to select the most cost effective means of delivering the<br>
call to subscriber 6. This selection of the outbound trunk group may be<br>
determined by call completion table 17 (as shown in Fig. 1) based on<br>
information contained in call completion data packet 50. For example, the<br>
NPA.nxx of the number in the device identification information field 56 in call<br>
completion data packet 50 can be used to indicate service provider 26 for that<br>
listing. This information is then used to determine whether a direct connection<br>
exists from switch 12 to that sendee provider 26. If such a direct connection<br>
exists, then the first choice route for this call would be via that link. In the event<br>
that such direct connection is not available or does not exist, an alternate route<br>
such as a connection to the PSTN 10 could be used.<br>
As illustrated in the flow diagram of Fig. 7, initially, at step 100,<br>
requester 4 calls system 2. The method for accessing system 2 can be via any<br>
known dialing pattern such as an "800" number, an NPA.nxx.xxxx number or<br>
NPA-555-xxxx, but also can be a shortened information-like number, such as<br>
"411," "555," "#555," etc. Preferably, access to system 2 is arranged such that<br>
the access number dialed by requester 4 is available nationwide such that<br>
requester 4 need not be concerned with individual access numbers depending on<br>
their location, or whether they are accessing system 2 via a wireless device or a<br>
wireline device.<br>
It should be noted that if past requested listing table 92 or top ranked<br>
listing table 94 is stored in server for communication to service providers 26<br>
which in turn is communicated to the wireless device of requester 4 as discussed<br>
above, and the requester wishes to place a call to one of the listing contained<br>
within, then the call may be dialed directly from the wireless device, directly<br>
through wireless carrier 26. The call can also be processed through switch 12 of<br>
system 2 based on the configuration of such arrangements for table 92,<br>
bypassing any operator terminal 20 directory assistance listing retrieval allowing<br>
the call to proceed directly to call completion.<br>
At step 102, Mobile Switching Center (MSC) S recognizes the pattern<br>
dialed by requester 4 as belonging to system 2 (i.e., a request for communication<br>
assistance) and routes the call to switch 12 along with the originating phone<br>
number of requester 4. Switch 12 tracks call detail information upon receiving<br>
the call from MSC 8.<br>
An additional feature of switch 12 is its ability to recognize and translate<br>
dial number and ANI strings allowing system 2 to provide agent application<br>
services to multiple customers. Upon dialing the appropriate number, MSC 8, is<br>
configured to recognize that the dialed number string belongs to the<br>
communication assistance system and method, and routes the inbound call to<br>
switch 12. If necessary, prior to routing the call to switch 12, MSC 8 may<br>
translate the user"s dial string (for example #555) to a digit sequence recognized<br>
by system 2.<br>
This translation allows different service carriers to access the service<br>
provided by the present invention using either a universal access number or<br>
different user dial strings. For example, in the event that two carriers decide to<br>
use different dial strings (i.e. cellular telephone carrier A may support access to<br>
system 2 by dial string *5 while cellular carrier B may access the service using<br>
the dial string 411), each carrier"s Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 8 may or<br>
may not select to translate this dial string before routing the call to switch 12.<br>
Upon receiving the inbound call, switch 12 may further translate the MSC 8 dial<br>
string and route the call to primary call center 16. The number sent by switch 12<br>
allows system 2 to identify the particular MSC 8 from which the dial string was<br>
received along with the actual MSC dial string so that elements of system 2 can<br>
determine what service is desired, and where the inbound call originated. It is<br>
also contemplated by this invention that calls may originate from a wireline<br>
carrier and/or VoIP carrier as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
For example, switch 12 might translate Mobiles Switching Center (MSC)<br>
8 dial string 411 to any four-digit number (this string length is for example only<br>
and can be modified) such as 9605. This four-digit string is used to populate the<br>
number dialed by requester field 60A in call completion data table 68. The<br>
translated digit string will be referred to as the Direct Inbound Dial (DID)<br>
number. Each switch 12 can have multiple DID numbers to identify requester<br>
4"s request for different services and their calling location.<br>
An additional feature available using this technology is to provide a<br>
separate dial string as an indicator of preferred language information to system 2.<br>
For example, if a dial string such as NPA.555.1818™ is used, switch 12, after<br>
translating the MSC dial string, will automatically send a Spanish language<br>
preference indicator in Incoming call Information Record 15 so that the primary<br>
call center 16 will route the call to an appropriate operator terminal 20, such as a<br>
Spanish speaking operator. Advantageously, Spanish speaking operators may be<br>
located remotely from system 2 and calls to be handled by them may be routed<br>
via call center 16 to a remote call center 16" as described above in reference with<br>
Figs. 1-3.<br>
It should be noted that the above example of call signaling methodology<br>
is intended only as an example of call routing and requester 4 identification and<br>
is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Any such signaling<br>
methodology protocol which is capable of transmitting the call between the MSC<br>
8 and switch 12 is within the contemplation of the present invention.<br>
At step 104, switch 12 routes the call to primary call center 16. To<br>
perform this task, switch 12 creates incoming call information record 15, as<br>
shown in Fig. 2, with the pertinent information as described in more detail<br>
above, and selects a direct trunk to call center 16. The configuration being used<br>
to carry the call between switch 12 and primary call center 16 preferably is a<br>
release link trunk configuration, discussed above in detail. While not discussed<br>
here, it is contemplated that any trunlcing and/or signaling configuration can be<br>
used to route the call from switch 12 to call center 16. It is also contemplated by<br>
this invention that switch 12 may connect this call to call center 16 via Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network PSTN 10 (i.e. using an 800 number or a directly<br>
dialed number).<br>
Next, at step 106, upon receiving the call from requester 4, primary call<br>
center 16 notifies an available operator terminal 20 with the appropriate skills, if<br>
necessary, that an inbound request has arrived and routes the call there. Upon<br>
establishing a link between requester 4 and operator terminal 20, primaiy call<br>
center 16 establishes a voice and communications link from the caller to the<br>
customer service representative. The two-way voice communication is routed<br>
directly from requester 4 through primary call center 16 to operator terminal 20,<br>
having an attached telephonic communication means. The data communication,<br>
which may include any information contained in incoming call information<br>
record 15 (i.e. the number dialed by requester 4 (the DID), the preferred<br>
language code, the originating phone number of the requester and the requester<br>
service provider field) is transmitted to the primaiy call center 16 to operator<br>
terminal 20 via Computer Telephony Interface (CTI) 29. CTI 29, deployed<br>
between primary call center 16 and operator terminals 20, is used to<br>
communicate the information necessary for the customer service representative<br>
and agent application 19 software to handle and complete the call.<br>
Using this link, an agent asks requester 4 for information regarding the<br>
services they are requesting. Requester 4 supplies the necessary information. An<br>
example of this information may include but is not limited to: the directory listed<br>
name, the defined locality, the email address, the name, wireline phone number,<br>
license plate, etc. It is contemplated by the current invention that traditional<br>
directory assistance and enhanced directory assistance may also be provided by<br>
this system.<br>
Next at step 106A, using information from the originating phone number<br>
field of incoming call information record 15, operator terminal 20 and agent<br>
application 19 search the caller number fields of the past requested listing table<br>
92 to determine if this requester 4 has called in the past. If not, then the operator<br>
terminal 20 proceeds to step 108 and begins generating a new past requested<br>
listing table 92 entry for that requester.<br>
If requester 4 is a past caller, then at step 106B, agent application 19 and<br>
operator terminal 20 display the information from past requested listing table 92<br>
and top ranked listing sub-table 94 to the operator in some form of organization<br>
based on a predefined criteria as discussed above.<br>
Next, at Step 106C, the operator determines if the newly requested listing<br>
is on the display information provided by the past requested listing table 92 or<br>
top ranked listing table 94. If not, the operator proceeds to step 108. If the listing<br>
is present, then the operator bypasses the searching step (108) and directly links<br>
requester 4 to the desired listing and then the system proceeds to step 109. This<br>
arrangement saves the service representative of operator terminal 20 a<br>
considerable amount of search time, leading to a better response time.<br>
If, as discussed above, requester 4 is a first time caller or if the listing<br>
requested is not in the past requested listing table 92, then at step 108, the agent<br>
at operator terminal 20 then initiates a search of database 18. Of course, if<br>
primary call center 16 is busy or there are no available operator terminals 20, the<br>
requester 4"s call can be forwarded to call Center 16" which can accommodate<br>
the requester"s inquiry in the same manner as described above in step 106. If the<br>
requested listing is unavailable, the agent awaits further instruction from<br>
requester 4.<br>
At step 109, whether the information was retrieved from past requested<br>
listing table 92 or if the listing was retrieved by the operator through a search,<br>
system 2 updates past requested listing table 92 and top ranked listing table 94<br>
according to the system 2 update schedule. In the case of first time caller a past<br>
requested listing table 92 is generated.<br>
It should be noted that if past requested listing table 92 and top ranked<br>
listing table 94 are stored on server for service provider 26 to be transferred<br>
directly on the wireless device of requester 4, then the updating process of the<br>
server may occur upon a similar time frame, such as daily, hourly or real-time<br>
and the list as it appears in the wireless device of requester 4 may be updated on<br>
a scheduled interval or when the wireless device is turned on and reconnected to<br>
its service provider 26 as discussed previously. Service provider 26 transmits the<br>
corresponding copy of table 92 to the wireless device assigned by requester 4<br>
during those scheduled intervals so that the wireless device would maintain an<br>
up-to-date list of the past requested listings. The updated list can also be<br>
transmitted to the wireless deviceor in accordance with a regularly scheduled<br>
maintenance connection directly with system 2 such as through an internet<br>
connetion.<br>
Next, at step 110, the listing for subscriber 6 is reviewed to determine if<br>
the number requested is unlisted or if it is masked to prevent requester 4 from<br>
receiving the actual number. The records associated with device 6 in databases<br>
such as 18 and 18", as listed in the listing table are provided with a connect field,<br>
having a sub-table 70 that indicates to operator terminal 20 whether or not a<br>
customer service representative is permitted to connect the call and, if so,<br>
disclose the number to requester 4. This ensures unlisted numbers remain<br>
unreachable and that the number of device 6 remains confidential if the<br>
corresponding subscriber so wishes.<br>
During operation, agent application 19 software reviews sub-table 70 to<br>
check if the number is unlisted. If so, the customer service representative<br>
informs requester 4 of this and awaits further instructions. If the number is<br>
listed, then agent application 19 checks to see if the number is masked. This is<br>
the feature that is "on" or "off at the request of the subscriber 6; however<br>
preferentially, the default is set to masked. If the number is masked, the call is<br>
connected without requester 4 ever seeing or hearing the number. If the number<br>
is not masked, requester 4 receives the number and is offered the service of<br>
automatic dial or other such comparable service. Of course, it is understood that<br>
the above described operation and method are easily implemented in this<br>
software arrangement or any other software arrangements known to those<br>
familiar with the art. It is also contemplated by this invention that database 18<br>
may be stored in an encrypted format to protect it from intrusion, hacking or<br>
other forms of unauthorized access or use.<br>
Alternatively, for an even more secure listing for device 6, the phone<br>
number associated with device 6 is not displayed to the customer service<br>
representative at operator terminal 20. Although system 2 will have the<br>
information it will not be displayed to the customer service representative. In<br>
this case, operator terminal 20 and switch 12, communicating through call<br>
completion data packet 50 and Wide Area Network (WAN) 25, complete the call<br>
while maintaining the secrecy of the phone number throughout.<br>
Next, at step 112, closing prompt module 27 decides on an appropriate<br>
closing prompt, based on the criteria described above. The closing prompt is<br>
either read from special or general announcement field of listing table 52A,<br>
selected or modified by override module 66 or selected by logic contained in<br>
closing prompt processor module 64 based on subscriber 6 and requester 4<br>
information found in call completion data table 68.<br>
It should be noted that subscriber 6 listings stored on past requested<br>
listing table 92 will be listed according to the masking feature criteria saved in<br>
their listing table in the connect field. Thus, if a requester 4 requests a<br>
subscriber 6 listing in which the connect field of that listing indicates that the<br>
listing is masked then not only will that request be connected in accordance with<br>
the masking instructions but also, when the listing is stored to that requester"s<br>
past requested listing table 92, the listing will appear in a masked format.<br>
In the case of a new requester 4, as discovered in step 106A, closing<br>
prompt module 27 may select a prompt inviting requester 4 to contact system 2<br>
and enter their information into a listing table 52A.<br>
A code or multiple codes for the prompt or prompts is then used by<br>
closing prompt module 27 to populate closing prompt code field 58 of call<br>
completion data packet 50 so as to determine which recorded closing prompt is<br>
to be played.<br>
Next at step 114, agent application 19 software on operator terminal 20<br>
constructs call completion data packet 50. Call completion data packet 50 is<br>
prepared using information from Incoming call information record 15, listing<br>
table 52 A, database 18, closing prompt module 27, agent application 19 and<br>
verbal information from requester 4.<br>
Upon completion of call completion data packet 50, operator terminal 20<br>
transmits call completion data packet 50 to switch 12 via Wide Area Network<br>
25. WAN 25 is connected to all switches 12 and all operator terminals 20 in<br>
system 2, such that should an operator terminal 20 be remotely located from<br>
switch 12 as a result of call routing, operator terminal 20 will be able to send the<br>
call completion data packet 50 through WAN 25, even to remotely located<br>
Switches 12. The appropriate switch 12 is identified by agent application 19,<br>
using the DID which identifies the originating switch where the requester 4"s<br>
call entered system 2.<br>
Next, at step 116, switch 12 initiates the call between requester 4 and<br>
subscriber 6. Switch 12 then begins tracking call detail information and other<br>
functions for the call completion leg. Switch 12 then uses the information in call<br>
completion data packet 50 to select the appropriate closing prompt from closing<br>
prompt storage module 13, and the appropriate outbound trunk group from call<br>
completion table 17.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 8. Fig, 8 is a<br>
diagram of an example of the components used to provide access to listings<br>
database 18 via a data protocol included but not limited to: WAP (Wireless<br>
Application Protocol), SMS, iMode interface, for the purpose of synchronizing<br>
data contained in past requested listing table 92 with requester 4"s remote<br>
wireless device. In this embodiment of the invention, the requester 4 performs a<br>
query via device 6. At MSC 8, the request is processed by WSCP (Wireless<br>
Services Control Point) 47 and interfaced through the carrier"s firewall 45 to the<br>
Internet via ISP 42. The request is in turn processed through system 2"s firewall<br>
45 and passed to web server 44. On web server 44, the processing application 49<br>
takes the information sent and structures a query that will go against the listing<br>
database 18. The listing database 18 will return the information contained in past<br>
requested listing table 92 or top ranked listing table 94 that are consistent with<br>
the request. This information will be sent back via firewall 45 to device 6. The<br>
transmitted information is then used to update the database on the device.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in relation to<br>
particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and<br>
other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred,<br>
therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure<br>
herein, but only by the appended claims.<br>
