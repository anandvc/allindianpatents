				<td>ADAPTABLE ANTENNA SYSTEM BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[00011	The  present  application  generally  relates  to  communications  and,  more<br>
specifically, to an adaptable antenna system.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	Wireless communication devices have different antenna requirements used in<br>
next generation wireless network systems. Detailed antenna configurations necessary to meet these requirements are impacted by many factors such as specific carrier requirements (e.g., operational modes, band classes, desired functionality) and device type (e.g., handsets, desktop modems, laptops, PCMCIA cards, PDAs, etc.). In addition, with the growing number of wireless standards (WWAN, WLAN, BlueTooth, UWB, FLO, DVB-H, etc.) and frequency bands (from approximately 410 MHz up to approximately 11 GHz), the conventional approach has been to add new antennas for the new standards and/or frequency bands on the host wireless devices. This adds costs (for the antenna elements, associated cables and connectors), requires additional space on the wireless device and also degrades isolation between the different RF transceivers. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a new antenna configuration such that the number of antennas may be kept to a minimum (i.e., no more than the existing number of antennas in current devices) while the antennas may still be able to support the up and coming wireless standards and new frequency spectrum.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003]	The invention utilizes small, narrow-band and frequency adaptable antennas to<br>
provide coverage to a wide range of wireless modes and frequency bands on a host wireless device. These antennas have narrow pass-band characteristics, require minimal space on the host device, and allow for smaller form factor. The invention also allows for fewer number of antennas to be used because of the frequency tunability feature of the small antennas together with the use of the transfer switch matrix. The operation of the antennas may also be adaptibly relocated from unused modes to in-use modes to<br>
 <br>
maximize performance. The features of the invention result in cost and size reductions of the antennas.<br>
[0004]	The host wireless device may be a portable phone, PDA, laptop, body-worn<br>
sensor, entertainment component, wireless router, tracking device and others. By making the antenna narrow-band in its frequency response, its physical size may be made much smaller than a conventional resonant antenna currently being used in existing wireless devices. To operate at a desired wireless channel or in a certain frequency sub-band or band at any given time, this small antenna is designed to have electronically selectable resonant frequency feature. This frequency adaptability allows for one small antenna to cover all the required wireless standards and frequency bands. Under some circumstances, more than one wireless modes may be required to operate concurrently. In this case, a second small tunable antenna similar to the first one may be employed on the same host wireless device. These two antennas may operate in different bands simultaneously. These antennas may also operate in the same frequency band simultaneously. Furthermore, in the same frequency band, one of these antennas may be used for transmitting and the other may be used for receiving simultaneously. Since these antennas have very narrow operating frequency response or pass band, the isolation between these antennas is much higher than that between the existing antennas currently being used on existing wireless devices. This is another feature of the invention, i.e., high isolation between antennas for concurrent operation without the need of adding more front-end filters.<br>
[0005]	It is appreciated that the number of these small, narrow-band, frequency tunable<br>
antennas may also be increased to more than two to support more than two concurrent operating modes. The operating frequencies and modes of these antennas may be adaptable to where resource and performance are needed most in the host device based on a preset performance criteria or user preference and selectivity. This allows for fewer number of antennas that can cover a given number of wireless modes and frequency bands. Performance is optimized and adaptable to where it is needed and/or required. For example, one or more of the multiple antennas may be used to suppress RF interference within the device or mitigate body or external effects. Antenna resource in this invention is adaptable and may be redirected to where it is needed most or may be divided based on a certain order of priorities.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013]	Some wireless communication devices, such as "world phones," are intended to<br>
operate with multiple frequency bands ("multi-band") and multiple communication standards ("multi-mode"), which may need a multi-band antenna and/or multiple antennas to function properly. A law of physics dictates a multi-band antenna to be electrically bigger than a single-band antenna to function over the required frequency bands. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a "multi-band" device may use one transmit/receive antenna for each frequency band and thus have multiple transmit/receive antennas. Alternatively, a "multi-band" device may use one multi-band antenna, but is required to add a multiplexer or a single-pole-multiple-throws switch to route the antenna signal for each frequency band to the appropriate transmitter and receiver of each band.<br>
[0014]	Similarly, a "multi-mode" device may use one transmit/receive antenna for each<br>
communication standard and thus have multiple transmit/receive antennas. Alternatively, a "multi-mode" device may use one multi-band antenna with additional multiplexers or single-pole-multiple-throws switches to operate. Some wireless standards, such as EVDO (Evolution Data Optimized) and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output), may use diversity schemes that need additional antennas to enhance data throughput performance and voice quality. The desire for more multi-band antennas on a wireless communication device has grown and has become an issue due to an increase in size and cost of wireless devices.<br>
<br>
[0015]	Referring back to FIG. 1, there is shown a system 110 with multiple<br>
transmit/receive antennas 102, 112, duplexers 104, 114, transmit circuitries 106, 116 and receive circuitries 108, 118. As an example, antenna 102, duplexer 104, transmit circuitry 106 and receive circuitry 108 may be configured to transmit and receive CDMA signals, while antenna 112, duplexer 114, transmit circuitry 116 and receive circuitry 118 may be configured to transmit and receive GSM or WCDMA signals.<br>
[0016]	FIG. 2 illustrates antenna frequency response in terms of reflected power for<br>
transmit and receive frequency bands 202A, 202B for the system 110 of FIG. 1. As an example, an ideal transmit frequency band may be 824-849 Megahertz (MHz), and an ideal receive frequency band may be 869-894 MHz in one configuration.<br>
[0017]	FIG. 3 illustrates a device 320 with two tunable antennas 302, 303, a frequency<br>
controller 310, transmit circuitry 306 and receive circuitry 308, in accordance with an aspect of the invention. The device 320 has one set of separate transmit and receive antennas 302, 303 that are tunable for multiple frequency bands and/or multiple wireless communication modes. The device 320 may be a wireless communication device, such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, a stationary device, or a portable communication card (e.g., Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA)), which may be inserted, plugged in or attached to a computer, such as a laptop or notebook computer.<br>
[0018]	The antennas 302, 303 may be sufficiently small and sized to fit inside a<br>
particular communication device. The transmit and receive circuitries 306, 308 are shown as separate units, but may share one or more elements, such as a processor, memory, a pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence generators, etc. The device 320 may not require a duplexer 104, which may reduce the size and cost of the device 320.<br>
[0019[	The separate transmit and receive tunable antennas 302, 303 have frequency<br>
tuning/adapting elements, which may be controlled by frequency controller 310 to enable communication in multiple frequency bands (multi-band) (also called frequency ranges or set of channels) and/or according to multiple wireless standards (multiple modes) as further described below. The dual antenna system 300 may be configured to adaptively optimize its performance for a specific operating frequency. This may be useful for a user who wishes to use the device 320 in various countries or areas with different frequency bands and/or different wireless standards.<br>
[0020]	For example, the antennas 302, 303 may be tuned to operate in any frequency<br>
band of multi-band wireless applications, such as Code Division Multiple Access<br>
<br>
(CDMA), Extended Global System for Mobile communications (EGSM), Global Positioning System (GPS), Digital Cellular System (DCS), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), etc. The antennas 302, 303 may be used for CDMA Ix EVDO communication, which may use one or more 1.25-MHz carriers. The dual antenna system 300 may use multiple wireless standards (multiple modes), such as CDMA, GSM, Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), Time-Division Synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), WiMAX, etc.<br>
[00211	The tuning elements of transmit and receive antennas 302, 303 may be separate<br>
elements or integrated as a single element. The tuning elements may be attached to an SPnT switch as further described below (for n fixed capacitors) or an SPIT switch (for on/off) for each of the n fixed capacitors. The tuning elements may be controlled by separate control units in the transmit and receive circuitries 306, 308 or may be controlled by a single control unit, such as frequency controller 310.<br>
[0022]	It should be noted that the antennas 302, 303 may have narrower individual<br>
frequency responses to minimize coupling (or cross-talk) between the transmit and receive circuitries 306, 308. At any time slot, each antenna may cover only a small portion of a transmit or receive frequency sub-band around an operating channel.<br>
[0023]	The tuning elements may be used to change the operating frequency of the<br>
transmit and receive antennas 302, 303. The tuning elements may be voltage-variable micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS), voltage-variable Ferro-Electric capacitors, varactors, varactor diodes or other frequency adjusting elements. As described above, the tuning elements may be attached to an SPnT switch (for n fixed capacitors) or an SPIT switch (for on/off) for each of the n fixed capacitors. For example, a different voltage or current applied to a tuning element may change a capacitance of the tuning element, which changes a transmit or receive frequency of the antenna 302 or 303.<br>
[0024]	The dual antenna system 300 may have one or more benefits. The dual antenna<br>
system 300 may be highly-isolated (low coupling, low leakage). A pair of orthogonal antennas may provide even higher isolation (lower coupling). High-Q and narrow-band antennas may provide high isolation between the transmit and receive chains in a full-duplex system, such as a CDMA system.<br>
[0025]	By using separate and small transmit and receive antennas 302, 303 with narrow<br>
instantaneous bandwidth to provide high isolation between the antennas 302, 303, the dual antenna system 300 may allow certain duplexers, multiplexers, switches and<br>
<br>
isolators to be omitted from radio frequency (RF) circuits in multi-band and/or multi-mode devices, which save costs and reduce circuit board area.<br>
[0026]	Smaller antennas provide more  flexibility in selecting antenna mounting<br>
locations in the device 320.<br>
[0027]	The dual antenna system 300 may enhance harmonic rejection to provide better<br>
signal quality, i.e., better voice quality or higher data rate.<br>
[0028]	The  dual  antenna system  300  may enable  integration  of antennas with<br>
transmitter and/or receiver circuits to reduce wireless device size and cost. The frequency-tunable transmit and receive antennas 302, 303 may enable size and cost reduction of host multi-mode and/or multi-band wireless devices by reducing the size and/or number of antennas. It is appreciated that the antennas 302, 303 of FIG. 3 may be configured in a variety of ways and locations inside the device 320.<br>
[0029]	The dual antenna system 300 may be used to implement a diversity feature, e.g.,<br>
polarization diversity or spatial diversity as illustrated in FIG. 4, for example, in EVDO or MIMO systems. FIG. 4 illustrates a device with multiple tunable antennas 432A, 432B, 433A, 433B, which may provide transmit diversity and/or receive diversity. Any number of tunable transmit and/or receive antennas may be implemented.<br>
[0030]	FIG. 5 illustrates a method of using the dual antenna system 300 of FIG. 3. In<br>
block 500, the dual antenna system 300 transmits signals with a first antenna 302 and receives signals with a second antenna 303 using a first frequency range associated with a first wireless communication mode. The first frequency range may be a set of channels, e.g., channels defined by different codes and/or frequencies.<br>
[0031]	In block 502, the device 320 determines whether there has been a change in<br>
frequency range and/or mode. If not, the dual antenna system 300 may continue in block 500. If there was a change, then the system 300 transitions to block 504. The device 320 may determine whether a frequency range and/or second wireless communication mode provides better communication (pilot or data signal reception, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), frame error rate (FER), bit error rate (BER), etc.) than the first frequency range and/or wireless communication mode.<br>
[0032]	In block 504, the dual antenna system 300 tunes the antennas 302, 303 with the<br>
antenna elements according to a second frequency range associated with the first wireless communication mode or a second wireless communication mode. The second frequency range may be a set of channels, e.g., defined by different codes and/or frequencies.<br>
<br>
[0033]	In block 506, the dual antenna system 300 transmits signals with the first<br>
antenna 302 and receives signals with the second antenna 303 using the second<br>
frequency range.<br>
[0034]	It is appreciated that antenna designs may be required for a wide array of<br>
portable wireless device types including:<br>
•	Handsets in candy bar, clam shell, slider, and PDA packaging formats (with<br>
the antenna being internal or external to the handset);<br>
•	Plug and play modems for laptops such as PCMCIA and ExpressCard formats<br>
(with the antennas being integral to the card PCB);<br>
•	Full-sized and mini-sized laptops (with the antennas being embedded in the<br>
laptop display or keyboard area); and<br>
•	Desktop modems (with the antennas being mounted on the modems).<br>
[0035]	Selection of an antenna approach for a given device type will be heavily<br>
dependent on the allowable volume, shape and local structure in the vicinity of the antenna site. Possible Operational Modes and Antenna Frequency Coverage<br>
[0036]	Given the above, the potential functional modes and frequency bands over which<br>
a portable device may operate vary significantly. That is, there are many possible combinations of modes and frequency bands. As can be seen, it may not be possible that all of the modes and bands identified in the following description may be implemented in a given portable device. As such, the required antenna frequency band coverage may depend on a subset of modes desired by a particular service provider and what spectrum is available for deployment.<br>
[0037]	Another complication will be if a particular service provider offers roaming<br>
services across continents. This will have the effect of greatly increasing the antenna frequency coverage requirements for the "world phones". As an example, consider a phone capable of operating in North America and Europe. Table 1 identifies potential frequency ranges required for a phone having dual antennas for MIMO and RX-TX diversity processing for different functionalities/modes.<br>
(Table  Removed)  <br>
Table 1 - Operating Frequencies for Adaptable Antenna System<br>
[0038]	As can be seen from Table 1, achieving all of the bandwidths of the different<br>
modes in a single passive antenna element given the space available in typical portable devices is an extreme challenge. A dual resonant antenna structure may be considered to improve the situation but even this approach would require sub-bands with dual band coverage for lower and upper bands, respectively. Even if more bands are added to support, for instance, broadcast services like FLO (approximately 716-722 MHz) and DVB-H (approximately 470-862 MHz), the problem is further exacerbated.<br>
[0039]	Hence, it is likely that the required frequency coverage will exceed practical<br>
limits if a passive single antenna approach is implemented in small portable radios. Accordingly, either multiple antennas and/or actively-tuned antenna technologies have to be considered to address this problem. Number of Antenna Elements<br>
[0040]	In addition to the many modes of operation, future radios implementing DO<br>
Revs. B and C will implement advanced signal processing techniques such as mobile receive diversity (MRD), mobile transmit diversity (MTD) and MIMO (multiple input, multiple output). These require more than one antenna element operating at the same frequency to be implemented on the device. With MIMO, up to 4 antenna elements may be required. In addition, antennas used for GPS, Bluetooth and 802.11a/b/g (WLAN) must also be considered. Table 2 below shows the number of antennas required assuming each individual mode has it own set of antennas.<br>
(Table  Removed)  <br>
Table 2 - Number of Antenna Required for Operating Modes in Table 1<br>
[0041]	As can be seen from Table 2, a radio implementing all modes with individual<br>
antennas for each mode would not be practical and some sharing of individual modes on single antenna element(s) will be required. The use of broadband or multi-band techniques and/or tunable antenna technologies may be considered to reduce the number of required antennas in a given platform. The feasibility of these approaches and the number of antennas required are driven by the number of bands and modes being shared on a given antenna element. Furthermore, the number of antenna elements required is determined by the instantaneous bandwidth required for each sub-band, the requirements for simultaneity between the various modes servicing the different antenna elements, and the mechanical constraints imposed by the radio's industrial design.<br>
<br>
These factors together determine the allowable size, location, and required isolation between the various antenna elements on a given platform. Antenna Configurations for Sharing Modes<br>
[0042]	The selection of the number and type of antennas is driven by the modes<br>
selected and bands of interest to be implemented. As mentioned earlier, passive and active (tunable) approaches may be considered as a means to .reduce the number of antenna elements. Passive antenna structures have fixed electrical characteristics after they are integrated in a given platform. As mentioned earlier, it is not practical to design small antennas for portable devices capable of working over the multi-octave bandwidths as implied by the modes of Table 1. It is more likely more than one antenna with different sub-bands will be required to support the many modes.<br>
[0043]	It should be noted that considerable antenna development may be required to<br>
extend the lower portion of the upper band to cover GPS in a small form factor. Furthermore, it may also be difficult to implement four antennas in a small handset or PCMCIA card without incurring poor antenna to antenna isolation. Poor isolation may cause unwanted interaction (e.g., receiver de-sense) between modes operating simultaneously on the device. In addition, this coupling may cause degradation to antenna gain efficiency due to power coupled to nearby antennas that is dissipated rather than radiated. Thus, the passive approach is not ideal for the design of antennas for portable devices to be working over the multi-octave bandwidths of the modes illustrated in Table 1. Active Antenna Configurations for Mode Sharing<br>
[0044]	An aspect of the invention is that tunable or reconfigurable antenna technologies<br>
may address several of the problems that fixed or passive approaches cannot. Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown one configuration or scheme of the invention including three antennas 602A-602C designed to tune a narrow(er) band resonance over frequencies from approximately 800-2700 MHz. A MxN switch matrix 604 is used to connect M antennas 602 to N different RF circuits or radios 606. Any of the N circuits or radios 606 may connect to any of the M antennas 602 via this MxN switch matrix 604. If M is smaller than N, then M different antennas 602 may connect to a subset of M RF circuits or radios simultaneously. If M is greater than N, then a subset of N antennas may connect to the N different RF circuits or radios simultaneously. This switch matrix may be built from M SPNT switches and N SPMT switches. It may also be built as an<br>
<br>
integrated device with internal switches. In this configuration or scheme, the antennas<br>
602A-602C cover most of the band classes indicated in Table 1.<br>
[0045]	In one example, FIG. 7(a) illustrates a fixed antenna configuration for a laptop/<br>
notebook/tablet using 8 antennas and FIG. 7(b) illustrates an adaptable antenna<br>
configuration for a laptop/notebook/tablet using 4 tunable antennas and a 4x8 transfer<br>
switch matrix to replace the 8 fixed antennas of FIG. 7(a).<br>
[0046]	There are several potential benefits to the approach of the invention including:<br>
•	Fewer antennas required to service all possible modes and band classes;<br>
•	Tunable antennas may be smaller than fixed antennas allowing for more options<br>
for fitting in;<br>
•	No compromise in "band edge" antenna performance compared to fixed<br>
bandwidth antenna approaches (antenna is "tuned" optimally);<br>
•	Tuning narrow band resonances improves out of band isolation;<br>
•	Modes may be allocated to antennas in a way that is best for simultaneous<br>
operation (least coupling);<br>
•	Modes may be allocated dynamically in response to changing RF environment<br>
and body loading; and<br>
•	Allows for higher order MIMO/diversity processing (N=3 for handsets and N=4<br>
for laptops).<br>
[0047]	It should be noted, however, that the tradeoff may include:<br>
•	Increased cost complexity of the RF front end and control electronics required to<br>
route the outputs from the various antennas to the various transceivers;<br>
•	Availability of commercial high power tuning devices (e.g., tunable capacitors)<br>
used to tune the antenna structures; and<br>
•	Potential for added factory calibration of tunable antenna elements.<br>
[0048]	For this approach, the tradeoff between the desired flexibility for mode<br>
allocation versus the cost/complexity of the front end and control electronics is important in establishing commercial feasibility. Regarding antenna design, it is appreciated that one needs to understand the minimum antenna size for a given device type that allows for tunability over the desired frequency range while at the same time providing good antenna efficiency, the impact of coupling on the tunability, and the requirements for factory calibration and impact of device tolerances.<br>
 Hybrid Configurations for Mode Sharing<br>
[0049]	Hybrid configurations refer to a combination of fixed and tunable antenna<br>
technologies. For example, the invention stated earlier that dual band antenna solutions covering BCO/BC9 and BC8/BC1 exist commercially today. For this case, it may be easier to tune the upper band lower in frequency to cover GPS or higher in frequency to cover IMT and MMDS bands (assuming lower 800-900 MHz band requires no tuning) than it would be to come up with a structure that tunes all the way from 824 to 2700 MHz. There may be many combinations that are possible and the feasibility of each will depend on the modes and band classes selected, the simultaneity requirements, and the device type (e.g., small handset vs. desktop modem or laptop). Impact of Simultaneity Requirements<br>
[0050]	Simultaneity refers to the modes operating simultaneously on a given radio. For<br>
instance, one could require position location activities using GPS while operating simultaneously with a Ix EVDO Rev. C data session or a Ix voice call. Requirements for simultaneity impact the desired antenna to antenna isolation and hence the options for the antenna element relative locations, the types of elements, their orientation as well the level of front end filtering which impacts the achievable front end loss.<br>
[0051)	A careful analysis will be needed to define the total isolation required allowing<br>
for simultaneous operation and the tradeoff between filter rejection (and added filter loss) and allowable antenna to antenna coupling.<br>
[0052]	Given the above, physically small and narrow-band antennas with electrically<br>
tunable resonant frequency may be employed in a wireless device. These antennas may be purposely designed to have very narrow frequency response only enough to cover the required instantaneous frequency bandwidth of one or few wireless channels or a portion of a frequency band depending on the wireless standards being used on this wireless device. This wireless device may be a portable phone, PDA, laptop, body-worn sensor, entertainment component, wireless router, tracking device and others. By making the antenna narrow-band in its frequency response, its physical size may be made much smaller than a conventional resonant antenna currently being used in existing wireless devices. To operate at a desired wireless channel or in a certain frequency sub-band or band at any given time, this small antenna is designed to have electronically selectable resonant frequency feature. This frequency adaptability allows for one small antenna to cover all the required wireless standards and frequency bands. Under many circumstances, more than one wireless modes may be required to operate<br>
concurrently; for example, CDMA and 802.11 may be on at the same time. In this case, a second small tunable antenna similar to the first one may be employed on the same host wireless device. These two antennas may operate in different bands simultaneously; for example, WWAN on together with WLAN on a laptop. These antennas may also operate in the same frequency band simultaneously as in the case of 802.1 In (for MIMO) or EVDO (for RX diversity). Furthermore, in the same frequency band, one of these antennas may be used for transmitting and the other may be used for receiving simultaneously. Since these antennas have very narrow operating frequency response or pass band, the isolation between these antennas is much higher than that between the existing antennas currently being used on existing wireless devices. This is another feature of the invention, i.e., high isolation between antennas for concurrent operation without the need of adding more front-end filters.<br>
[0053]	The number of these small, narrow-band, frequency tunable antennas may also<br>
be increased to more than two to support more than two concurrent operating modes. The operating frequencies and modes of these antennas may be adaptable to where resource and performance are needed most in the host device based on a preset performance criteria or user preference and selectivity. This allows for fewer number of antennas that can cover a given number of wireless modes and frequency bands. Performance is optimized and adaptable to where it is needed and/or required. For example, if EVDO and 802.1 In are both on, then two antennas may be dedicated to EVDO and two for 802.1 In. When EVDO is no longer needed, its two antennas may be used for 802.1 In to increase performance of 802.1 In. Antenna resource in this invention is adaptable and may be redirected to where it is needed most or may be divided based on a certain order of priorities.<br>
