Plastics  composite  mouldings   obtainable via welding  in an   alt ernating   electromagn etic  fi eld<br>
The invention relates to plastics corrposite mouldings<br>
obtainable	via	welding	in	an	alternating<br>
elect romagn etic f i eld, wher e the weld is achieved with the aid of a plastics material which corrprises nano-scale,    magnetic   oxidic   particles.<br>
Plastics   mouldings   can   be  bonded   by  a   very wide  variety of    plastics    welding    processes.     Familiar    processes    are heat ed-t ool     welding,      heat ed-coil     welding,      ultrasound welding,    vibration   welding,    las er   trans mission   welding, spin   welding   and   high-f r equenc y welding.<br>
Processes      of      jointing      by     means	of      an      alternating<br>
el ect romagn etic    f i eld     or     by    means	of     microwaves     ar e<br>
1 ess of t en us ed and are still	considered to be<br>
specia1ized   processes.<br>
In the case of laser transmission welding, at least the moulding facing towards the radiation sourc e has to be transparent to the las er beam, thus restricting the pigmentation and c olouring of the plastics materials that   can   be used.<br>
In contrast, the r estrictions in r elation to colorants do not arise in the case of welding in an aut omating el ect romagn etic   f i eld.<br>
Welding with elect romagnetic radiation (induction welding) usually requires a welding aid which is magnetically activatable per se or by virtue of appropriate ingredients. The welding aid becomes heated  via hysteresis losses and/or eddy-current losses, and energy input here during inductive heating is about 1500 times higher than when conducted heat is used. The phas es      of     induction     welding     include     melting,      melt<br><br>
fusion    and   consolidation,    and   the   welding    process   can<br>
■« be carried   out   continuously  or   batchwise.<br>
The welding aid can, for example, be placed in the form of sheets or foils between the joint areas of the mouldings to be joined. Magnetic activatabilit y is often generated via metallic inclusions, but this complicat es the production process of the plastics parts to be joined and these inclusions are sometimes undesirable in the downstream product. Welding aids with particulate f erroiragnetic fillers are relatively expensive and exhibit poor ef f ectiveness factors, and this has hitherto prevented the process from becoming one  of   the well-established   jointing   processes.<br>
It was ther ef or e an obj ect of the invention to develop plastics mat erials which are magnetically activatable via appropriat e additives, thus providing weldabilit y of the same in an alternating electromagnetic field. Thes e mat erials should be capable of use either in the f or m of int egral c onstituents of the plastics mouldings to   be  joined   or   in   the form of   additional   welding   aids,<br>
DE-A-19 92 4138 claims an adhesive composition which corrpris es int er alia nano-scale particles with super-pararragnetic   properti es.<br>
DE-A-1016 3399 describes a nanoparticulat e pr eparation<br>
which has a coherent phase and at least one particulate<br>
phas e        coirpos ed	of	superparamagnetic	nano-scale<br>
particles dispersed therein. Preference is given here to preparations   in  the form of   an   adhesive conposition.<br>
The conpositions of DE-A-19924138 and DE-A-10163399 can be heat ed   in   an   alt ernating   electromagnetic   f i eld.<br>
The particles used not only in DE-A-19924138 but also in DE-A-10 16 339 9 have pr ef erably been surf ac e-modif led or   surface-coated,   in   order   to  inhibit   agglomeration   or<br><br>
accretion    of    the   nano-scale   particles    and/or    in    order<br>
r<br>
to provide good dispersibilit y of the particulate phase in the coherent phase. A disadvantage here is that the substanc es us ed f or surf ac e coating or f or surf ac e modification can be released in particular on exposure to high t enperatures and/or to high levels of mechanical action. A consequence is that the nano-scale particles can agglomerat e or accr et e, thus losing their s up er par a magn et ic   pr op ert i es.<br>
The rheological properties of the nan oparticulat e preparation according to DE-A-1016 3399 or of the adhesive corrposition according to DE-A-1992 4138 can be adjusted widely via the nature and amount of the dispersion medium However, it is impossible, or possible only to a li mit ed ext ent, to adjust the rheology of the pr eparation via the nano-scale, super-pararragnetic particles thems elves, sine e the super¬paramagnetic properties are associat ed withc ertain particle sizes. The particles almost entirely take the f or m of pri mar y particles in the preparation, and therefore the only possible method for adjusting rheology, f or example thickening, at the same ti me involves variation in the content of superparamagn etic particl es.<br>
The previous patent application DE 10 20 0 40 57 8 30 of 01. 12. 2004, which was unpublished at the earliest pri or it y dat e of the pr es ent invention, and the entire c ont ent of which is inc orporat ed her ein by way of reference, describes an adhesive corrposition corrprising a polymerizable monomer and/or a polymer and superparamagnetic oxidic particles dispersed therein which are composed of aggregat ed primary particles ,  where the prirrery particles are corrposed of rregnetic metal oxide domains whose diameter is from 2 to 100 nm in a non-magn etic metal oxide matrix or non-magn etic metalloid   oxide   matrix.<br><br>
Surprisingly,    it    has    now    been    found    that    nano-scale, magnetic     oxidic    particles     are    suitable    additives    for plastics     materials,    for    providing    weldability    of    the same in   an   alternating   electromagnetic   field.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides the use of nano-scale, magnetic oxidic particles as additives in plastics materials, for providing weldability of the same in   an   alternating   electromagnetic   field.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the production of a plastics corrposite moulding via welding in an alt ernating electromagn etic f i eld, in which the weld is achieved with the aid of a plastics rraterial which  c orrpris es   nano-scale,    magn etic   oxidic   particles.<br>
The invention in particular provides plastics composite weldings obtainable via welding in an alt ernating electromagn etic field, wher e the weld is achieved with the aid of a plastics material which corrprises nano-scale,    magnetic   oxidic   particles.<br>
The HBgnetic oxidic particles are very substantially in homogeneous dispersion within the inventive plastics riBterials and in particular are in non-agglomerat ed form Within the plastics Jiaterials, these particles are in particular stable to temperature variation and exhibit no agglomeration even at high t errperatur es. It is moreover possible to control the rheology of the compositions very substantially independently of the content   of  these particles.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term aggr egat ed indie at es three-dimensional structures of accr et ed pri mary particles. Bonding between a pluralit y of aggregates can give agglomerates. These agglomerates can readily be separat ed again via mechanical action, e. g. during extrusion proc edur es. In contrast to this, it      is      generally     not      possible     to     break     d own      the<br><br>
aggregates  to  give the primary particles.<br>
The diameter of the aggregates of the nano-scale, magnetic oxidic particles can preferably be greater than   100   nm and   smaller  than   1   µm.<br>
It is preferable that the diameter of the aggregates of the nano-scale, magnetic oxidic particles, at least in one spatial direction, is not more than 250 nm. Figure 1 illustrat es this situation, in which the diamet er of two branches of an aggr egat e is 80 n m and 135   n m<br>
The term domains indieat es regions spatially separat e from one another in a matrix. The diameter of the domains of the nano-scale, iragnetic particles is from 2 to   100   nm<br>
The t er m nano-scal e, magn etic oxidic particles in particular   indie at es   superparamagnetic   particles.<br>
The domains can also have non-magn etic regions, but these then make no contribution to the rregnetic proper¬ties   of   the particles.<br>
There may also be magnetic dorrains present which, by virtue of their size, do not exhibit any superpara-magnetism, and induce remanence. This leads to an increase in volume-specific saturation magn etization. According to the pr es ent invention, the number of superparamagnetic domains pr es ent in the superpara-rregnetic particles is such that the inventive plastics materials can be heated to melting point by means of an alt ernating electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic field.<br>
The surrounding matrix can entirely or only partially surround the domains of the superparamagnetic particles.     The   t er m   partially   surround    indieates    that<br><br>
individual doirains can protrude from the surf ac e of an aggr egat e.<br>
The superparamagnetic domains of the particles are always   non -agglomerat ed.<br>
The domains   can  comprise  one  or   more  metal   oxides.<br>
The   magnetic   domains   can   preferably conprise the   oxides of    iron,    c obalt,    nickel,    chromium,     europium,     yttrium, samarium   or    gadolinium     The    form   in    which    the    metal oxides    are   pr es ent    in    thes e   domains    can    be   a    single form or   various   forrre.<br>
One particularly pr ef err ed magnetic dorrain is iron oxide in the form of gamrrB-Fe203 (Y-Fe203) , Fe304, or a mi xtur e corrpos ed   of   gamira-F 6203   ( y-F e203)    and/or   Fe304.<br><br><br><br>
The inventive plastics rrat erials can pr ef erably have a proportion of superparanagn etic particles in the range from 0. 1   to   40%   by weight.-<br>
Suitable    superparanagn etic    particles    are   described    by way  of   exanple in   EP-A-128 4485,   and   also  in   DE 10317067, the   entire   content    of    which   is   inc orporat ed   herein    by way  of   reference.<br>
Accordingly, the superparamagnetic particles can be obtained via a proc ess encorrpassing the f oil owing St eps:<br>
-  vaporization,       together       or       s eparately,        of       a<br><br>
compound which conpris es the metal c orrponent or metalloid component of the non-rmgnetic matrix and of a compound which coirprises the metal component of the superparamagnetic domains, where at least one compound contains chlorine and where the constitution of the vapour corresponds to the ratio subsequently desired of superparamagnetic domains   and   of   non-magnetic   matrix,<br>
-	introduction of this mixture into a mixing zone, in which it is mixed with air and/or oxygen and with a combustion gas, and introduction of the mixture into a burner of known design, and cem¬bustion of this mixtur e in a flame within a c ombustion  chamber,<br>
-	cooling of the hot gases and of the solid product, removal of the gases from the solid product and, if appropriate, purification of the solid product via heat -treat ment by means of gas es moistened with  water   vapour.<br>
The   particles    can    moreover    be   obtained    via    a    process enc orrpassing the following   steps:<br>
-	pr oduct i on- of an a er os ol vi a at omization of a pr ecursor which conpris es the metal conponent of the superparamagnetic domains and which takes the form of   a  solution   or  dispersion   of   a   salt,<br>
-	mixing of this aerosol with the gas mixture from a flame hydrolysis process or from a flame oxidation process, where the mixture comprises the precursor of the non-magnetic • matrix, in a mixing zone, where the constitution of the vapour corresponds to the ratio subs equehtly desired of superpara magnetic   domains   and   of  non-magnetic   matrix,<br>
-	introduction     of    the    aerosol-gas     mixture    into    a<br><br>
burn er of kn own d es i gn and combus t i on of this mixture  in   a  flame within   a  combustion   chamber,<br>
-	cooling of the hot gases and of the solid product,<br>
removal of the gas es from the solid product and,<br>
if appropriate, purification of the solid product<br>
via heat -treat ment by means of gas es moist en ed<br>
with  water   vapour,<br>
where the precursor of the superparamagnetic domains and/or the pr ecursor of the non-magnetic matrix  is   a  chlorine-containing  compound.<br>
The   particles    can  moreover    be    obtained    via    a    process encompassing  the following   steps:<br>
-	production, s eparately or together, of an aerosol via atomization of a pr ecursor of the superpara-iragnetic doirains and of a precursor of the non-magnetic rratrix, where thes e precursors take the form of a solution or dispersion of salts, and where the constitution of the aerosol corresponds to the ratio subs equently desired of superpara-magn etic  domains   and   of   non-magn etic   matrix,<br>
-	introduction, separately or together, of the aerosols of the precursors into a mixing zone, in which they are mixed with air and/or oxygen and with  a combustion   gas,   and<br>
-	introduction of the aerosol-gas mixture into a burn er of kn own d es i gn and c o mbustion of this mixture in   a  flame within   a  combustion   chamber,<br>
-	cooling of the hot gases and of the solid product, removal of the gas es from the solid product and, if appropriate, purification of the solid product via heat -tr eat ment by means of gas es moist en ed with   water   vapour,<br><br>
where the precursor of the superparamagnetic domains and/or the precursor of the non-magnetic matrix  is   a chlorine-containing compound.<br>
Combustion gases which can be used with preferenc e ar e h ydr og en   or   met han e.<br>
With respect to weldability, the selection of the<br>
polymer mat erials underlying the inventive plastics<br>
material is such, that the plastics material is<br>
thermoplastically softenable. The plastics mat erial<br>
generating the weld can preferably be bas ed on single-<br>
or two-corrponent polyur ethan e, single- or two-conponent<br>
polyepoxide, single- or two-conponent si lie one polymer,<br>
silan e-modif i ed polymer , polyamide, ( meth) acrylat e-<br>
functiona1 polymer , polyester, polycarbonat e, cyclo-<br>
olefin copolymer, polysiloxane, poly( ether) sulphone,<br>
polyether	ketone,	polystyrene,	polyoxymethyl en e,<br>
polyamideimide, polytetraf luoroethylene, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride,	perf luoro ethylene-propylene	copolymer,<br>
perf luoroalkoxy        copolymer,	methacr ylat e/butadiene/<br>
styrene copolymer   and/or   liquid-crystalline copolyester.<br>
The production method for the plastics mat erial corrprising nano-scale, magnetic oxidic particles pref erably mixes, extrudes, and then pelletizes the underlying polymer materials in the form of powder or of pellets with the nano-scale, magnetic oxidic particles in the form of a powder. This form can be particularly advantageous  for  polyamide polymers.<br>
The   plastics    mat erial   then   takes   the   f or m   of   pellets, which   can    in   turn    be   proc ess ed    via    extrusion   to   give mouldings ,   s emlf inished   products ,    sheets ,   foils   and   the lik e.<br>
The plastics material can, if appropriate, corrprise not only polymers   but   also  polymerizable   monomers,   wat er   or<br><br>
organic   dispersion    media.     Suitable,    organic   dispersion media    can     by   way    of     example    be    selected    from    oils, f ats,    waxes,    est ers    of    C6 -C30   monocarboxylic    acids   with mono-,   di -   or   trihydric   ale ohols,    saturat ed   ac yclie   and cyclie    hydrocarbons ,    f atty   acids ,    low-molecular-weight aleohols ,    f atty   aleohols    and    mi xtur es    of    thes e.     Among these    are    by   way    of     example    paraffins    and    paraffin oils,       mineral      oils,       linear      saturat ed      hydrocarbons gen er ally  having   more  than   8   carbon   atoms ,    e. g.    tetra-d ecan e,      hexadecane,      octadecan e,      etc. ,     c yclic     hydro¬carbons ,       e. g.       c yclohexan e     and     d ecahydronaphthalene, waxes,      est ers     of     f att y    acids,     silicon e     oils,      etc, Pr ef erred    exarrples    are   lin ear    and    c yclic    hydrocarbons and   ale ohols.<br>
The   plastics    mat erial   which   corrpris es    the   nano-scale, magnetic     oxidic     particles     is     used     according    to    the invention    as    means   that    generat es   the   weld   during   the production   of   a   plastics   corrposit e   moulding   via  welding-in   an   alt ernating   electronagn etic   f i eld.<br>
The plastics mouldings to be joined can be compos ed entirely or to some extent of the plastics material comprising  nano-scale,    magnetic   oxidic   particles.<br>
At least one of the mouldings to be joined her e is conposed, at least in the region' of the joint area, of this   plastics   mat erial.<br>
The plastics mouldings can be produc ed in a rrenn er known   per   se and  with  any desired   shape.<br>
Mbuldings      provided      partially     with      the      nano-seale,<br>
magnetic     oxidic     particles,     f or     example    only    in     the<br>
region    of    the   joint    areas,    can    be   obtained    by   way   of<br>
exanple     via     coextrusion      or     sequential     coextrusion,<br>
multilayer	extrusion,	multicomponent	in j action<br>
moulding,    or  coating.<br><br>
Th,e preliminary products to be joined can by way of exarrple be components of hollow bodies. These can then be proc ess ed to give ass embled hollow bodies, such as c ont ain ers, pipes or lin es, which have been w eld ed dir ect ly or by way of conn ecting elements, such as sleeves,   fittings   or   f langes.<br>
The plastics material that generates the weld can also be pr es ent s eparately, for exarrple in the f or m of sheets or foils which are plac ed between sheet -like plastics parts and which bond thes e, as a means of welding.<br>
The resultant plastics composite mouldings then take the f or m of multilayer conposit es compos ed of elements welded in the mann er of a sheet, examples being sheets and/or   foils.<br>
In the corresponding process, the plastics mouldings to be joined are exposed at least in the region of the joint area to an alt ernating electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic field, where the plastics material that generates   the weld   is   heated  to   melting  point.<br>
For the heating process, it is preferable to use an alt ernating electromagnetic field whos e f r equenc y is in the range from 30 Hz to 100 MHz. The frequencies of familiar inductors are suitable, exarrples being medium frequencies in the range from 100 Hz to 100 kHz or high f r equencies in the range from 10 kHz to 60 IVHz, in particular   from 50   kHz   to   3   NHz.<br>
The rragn etic dorrains and in particular the nano-part iculat e dorrains of the superparamagnetic particl es permit particularly effective utilization of the energy input   of   available  electromagnetic   radiation.<br>
This also applies by analogy to heating via alternating el ectroimgnetic    f i elds    of     microwave    radiation.      It    is<br><br>
pr ef erable here to use microwave radiation whos e frequency is in the range from 0, 3 to 300 GHz. In addition to the microwave radiation, it is preferable to mak e us e of a DC magnetic f i eld whos e f i eld str ength is in the range from about 0.001 to 10 tesla, for resonant frequenc y s etting. The field strength is preferably in the range from 0.015 to 0.045 tesla and in  particular  from 0.02  to 0.06   tesla.<br>
