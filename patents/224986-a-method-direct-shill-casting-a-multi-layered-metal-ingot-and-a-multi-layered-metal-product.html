				<td>A Method Of Direct Chill Casting A Multi-Layered Metal Ingot<br>
And A Multi-Layered Metal Product<br>
The present invention relates to the simultaneous casting of multiple<br>
alloys, in particular, direct chill casting of multiple aluminum alloys using a metallic<br>
member between the alloys to form a multi-component cast product and/or the use of a<br>
metallic member as an external layer on a cast ingot.<br>
In the production of aluminum alloy ingots by a conventional direct<br>
chill (DC) casting process, molten aluminum is poured into an opened end mold. The<br>
lower end of the mold is initially closed by a platform referred to as bottom block and<br>
the molten metal pools within the mold. The bottom block is progressively lowered in<br>
step with the pouring of the molten metal. The wall of the DC mold is continuously<br>
cooled so that a solid skin of metal forms in contact with the mold wall at the level of<br>
the surface of the pool of molten metal in the mold. An example of the method of DC<br>
casting is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,071,072, incorporated herein by reference. In<br>
this conventional operation, a single molten aluminum alloy is direct cast into an ingot.<br>
Such aluminum ingots are often times incorporated with other alloys to<br>
form a composite product. For example, brazing sheet for the header of a heat<br>
exchanger or for reinforcement structures may be produced from an Aluminum<br>
Association (AA) 3000 series aluminum alloy with a clad layer of an AA 4000 series<br>
alloy. Evaporator sheet product or plate type heat exchangers typically include a 3000<br>
series alloy clad on both sides with a 4000 series alloy. Likewise, radiators often are<br>
formed from a 3000 series alloy with a 4000 series cladding and water-side liner of an<br>
AA 1000, 5000, 6000, or 7000 series alloy. The clad layer is conventionally roll<br>
bonded in plate form onto an ingot of the core alloy (e.g., a 3000 series alloy). Roll<br>
bonding requires multiple rolling passes, scalping, reheating, and sealing steps to<br>
produce the clad alloy in sheet form. Each of those processes adds to the cost of the<br>
final clad product. In addition, the thickness of cladding produced via roll bonding is<br>
generally limited to a maximum of only about 35% of the total sheet thickness. Roll<br>
bonding can also be extremely difficult if the mechanical properties of the alloys being<br>
roll bonded are too dissimilar at the rolling temperatures. For example, when one alloy<br>
deforms very easily while the other alloy does not, the alloys do not seal properly or<br>
the target cladding ratio is off.<br>
More recently, attempts have been made at casting composite metal<br>
products. One such process is described in DE 4420697 in which one alloy of a billet<br>
is DC cast on one side of a fixed barrier and another alloy is DC cast on the opposite<br>
side of the barrier. The process is controlled such that the two molten metals come in<br>
contact with one another while in the molten state to provide a controlled mixing of the<br>
two melts. In this manner, the composition of the composite billet in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the contact surface of the two metal components changes<br>
continuously. The concentration of the individual alloy elements changes continuously<br>
from the values of one alloy to the values in the other. The fixed barrier maintains the<br>
two components apart from each other within the mold, and the barrier is positioned<br>
off center so that one component is narrower than the other. The alloy closest to the<br>
mold (the narrower component) cools and solidifies earlier in the process than the<br>
other alloy, i.e., at a great height from the bottom block. The bottom block is<br>
withdrawn at a speed whereby the levels of the melts within the mold remain<br>
approximately even. Although one alloy solidifies before the other alloy, there is a<br>
small region between the melts in which the melts are able to flow into one another<br>
and mix briefly to promote adhesion between the two alloys. While this method<br>
provides some adhesion between the two components of the cast product, the mixing<br>
of the components which occurs during the casting can be detrimental to the finished<br>
product. The location and shape of the fixed barrier are also critical to avoid<br>
intermixing of the molten alloys. The properties of the alloys simultaneously cast in<br>
this manner may be affected by the mixing of the alloying components. This method<br>
also requires careful control of molten metal flow to avoid mixing due to hydraulic<br>
pressure differences as well as careful control of the solidification rate of the alloy<br>
forming the narrower component to ensure only brief mixing of the alloys in the region<br>
immediately below the barrier.<br>
Another method of DC casting a composite ingot is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,567,936 in which an outer layer is simultaneously cast within an inner<br>
component. According to this method, the outer layer solidifies prior to contact within<br>
the molten inner alloy. This avoids mixing between the components of the inner<br>
component and the outer layer. A drawback to this method is that the outer layer must<br>
solidify completely before the inner alloy can be cast within* the outer layer. The<br>
thickness of the outer layer also is limited because the heat of the inner component<br>
must exit through the outer layer to the exterior surfaces of the cast product. Hence,<br>
the configuration of the final multi-component product also is limited.<br>
Accordingly, a need remains for a method of simultaneously casting a<br>
multi-alloy metal product with a minimum of mixing between the alloys of the product<br>
and which can produce cast metal products in a variety of configurations.<br>
This need is met by the method of the present invention of casting a<br>
multi-layered metal ingot including the steps of delivering a metallic divider<br>
member into a direct chill mold, pouring a first molten metal into the mold on one side<br>
of the divider member and pouring a second molten metal into the mold on the other<br>
side of the divider member, and allowing the first molten metal and the second molten<br>
metal to solidify to form a metal ingot which includes the divider metal layer disposed<br>
between the two cast layers. The multi-layered metal ingot removed from the mold<br>
contains at least two cast layers including the first and second metals separated by a<br>
layer of the divider member. Alternatively, the divider member may be positioned<br>
against a wall of the mold and a single molten metal is poured into the mold to produce<br>
one cast layer bound to the divider member thereby forming an outer shell or cladding<br>
on the ingot. The divider member may be a sheet having a thickness of up to about<br>
0.25 inch or a plate having a thickness of up to about 6 inches. The position of the<br>
divider member may be shifted within the mold to produce varying thicknesses of the<br>
cast metals. More than one divider member may be placed in the mold with molten<br>
metals poured on opposite sides of each divider member to produce a metal product<br>
having at least three cast layers separated by the divider members. The fundamental<br>
principles guiding the attainment of a strongly bonded interface between the divider<br>
member and the molten metal are identical regardless of where the divider member is<br>
located within the ingot. The divider member may also be tubular in shape. One metal<br>
is poured into the tubular divider member while another metal is poured between the<br>
tubular divider member and the mold.<br>
The molten metals may each be an alloy of AA series 1000,2000,3000,<br>
4000,5000,6000,7000, or 8000. The divider member may be a solid metal that will<br>
survive exposure to the molten aluminum during the casting operation. For the<br>
purpose of maintaining a "clean" scrap loop, the divider member preferably is<br>
aluminum or an aluminum alloy or a clad aluminum product that has a solidus<br>
temperature greater than the liquidus temperatures of the alloys cast on either side<br>
thereof. It is preferred that the solidus temperature of the divider member be at least<br>
610°C. A particularly suitable metal for the divider member is an AA 1000 series<br>
alloy. Alternatively, the divider member may be in the form of a screen alloys of iron,<br>
titanium, magnesium, copper, or nickel.<br>

relate to the invention as it is oriented in the drawing figures. However, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention may assume various alternative variations and step<br>
sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood<br>
that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and<br>
described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics related to the<br>
embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting.<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of casting a multi-layered<br>
metal ingot and the product produced thereby. The method of the present invention<br>
uses an apparatus 2 schematically shown in Fig. 1 which incorporates a conventional<br>
direct chill mold 4. The direct chill mold 4 defines a water chamber 6 and a slit 8<br>
through which water is emitted directly onto the surface of an ingot 10 emerging from<br>
the mold 4. The cast ingot 10 solidifies on a bottom block 12.<br>
A metallic divider member 14 is suspended into the mold 4 and seats on<br>
the bottom block 12. The metallic divider member 14 provides a barrier between a<br>
first molten metal 16 which is fed into the mold 4 via a first trough 18 and a second<br>
molten metal 20 fed into the mold 4 via a second trough 22. The bottom block 12 is<br>
withdrawn in the direction of arrow A while coolant (water) is applied to the surfaces<br>
of the ingot 10. Suitable speeds for the bottom block 12 are about I to about 6 inches<br>
per minute, preferably about 2 to about 3 inches per minute. When citing such ranges<br>
herein, the range includes all intermediate values. The divider member 14 remains in<br>
contact with the bottom block 12 and accordingly travels downwardly at the speed that<br>
the bottom block 12 travels. A crane (not shown) equipped with movable grips (e.g.,<br>
wheels) may be used to suspend the divider member 14 over the apparatus 2 and<br>
deliver the divider member 14 into the mold 4. Other mechanisms may be used to<br>
suspend and deliver the divider member 14 into the mold 4.<br>
Each of the first and second molten metals 16 and 20 solidify as<br>
generally shown in Fig. 1. The portion 24 of the metal 16 closest to the mold 4<br>
solidifies very quickly, e.g. in less than about 10 seconds. Solidification of the metal<br>
20 likewise occurs at a region 26 adjacent the mold 4. Semi-solid zones 28 and 30<br>
form below the level of the respective first solidification regions 24 and 26. The metals<br>
16 and 20 also begin to solidify adjacent the divider member 14 at respective locations<br>
32 and 34. The locations 24,26,32 and 34 may be at the same height as each other or<br>
at different heights from the bottom block 12. In many cases, the melting point of the<br>
metal of the divider member 14 is less than the temperature of the incoming molten<br>
metals 16 and 20. Nevertheless, the divider member 14 does not completely melt and<br>
serves to prevent mixing of the metals 16 and 20 by acting as a heat sink and as an<br>
interface between the metals 16 and 20. Some heat from the molten metals 16 and 20<br>
transfers into the divider member 14 and subsequently is transferred out of the portion<br>
36 of the divider member 14 that extends up and out of the mold 4. Similarly, some of<br>
the heat transferred to the divider member 14 is also subsequently transferred out of<br>
the divider member to the solidifying ingot 10 below the molten metals 16 and 20.<br>
The divider member 14 may experience minimal melting (erosion), but this minimal<br>
amount does not affect the metallurgical properties of each of the metals 16 and 20<br>
cast on opposing sides of a divider member 14. Upon complete solidification, the<br>
metals 16 and 20 form respective solid components 38 and 40 separated by the divider<br>
member 14.<br>
The minimal melting of the divider member 14 provides for some<br>
mixing of the components of the divider member 14 with the components of the metal<br>
16 on one side and with the components of the metal 20 on the other side. The<br>
minimally mixed metals solidify and thereby adhere the components 38 and 40 to the<br>
divider member 14. Superior adhesion between the divider member 14 and<br>
components 38 and 40 is achieved when the temperature of the divider member 14<br>
reaches at least the higher of the liquidus temperature of component 38 and the<br>
liquidus temperature of component 40. It is believed that when the divider member 14<br>
initially contacts the molten metals 16 and 20, some solidification of the metals rapidly<br>
occurs on the surfaces of the divider member 14. This temporary solidification is not<br>
shown in Fig. 1. Inherent oxides on the surfaces of the divider member 14 generally<br>
remain and become entrapped between the divider member 14 and the solidified metal.<br>
When the molten metal temperatures are sufficiently high, the divider member 14<br>
locally reaches a temperature greater than the liguidus temperature of the metals 16<br>
and 20 and the initially solidified metal remelts as the divider member 14 travels in the<br>
direction of the arrow A. The divider member 14 is then directly exposed to the<br>
molten metals 16 and 20 and the oxide destabilizes with some minimal melting of the<br>
divider member 14. As the divider member 14 continues downwardly, the local<br>
temperatures of the molten metals 16 and 20 decrease to their liquidus temperatures<br>
and solidification begins. The local temperatures continue to drop until the solidus<br>
temperatures are reached and the alloys fully solidify resulting in strong bonds between<br>
the components 38 and 40 and the respective sides of the divider member 14.<br>
Alternatively or in addition thereto, flux may be applied to one or both<br>
sides of the divider member 14. The flux may be applied to the divider member 14<br>
directly (e.g. by coating the surfaces of the divider member 14 with flux) or flux may<br>
be applied to the upper surfaces of the molten metals 16 and 20 that pool in the mold 4.<br>
Immediately prior to contact between the divider member 14 and the molten metals 16<br>
and 20, the flux melts and chemically reduces oxides on the divider member 14 which<br>
could otherwise interfere in the adhesion of the molten metals 16 and 20 to the divider<br>
member 14. Suitable flux includes potassium aluminum fluoride based fluxes (e.g.<br>
Nocolok®) along with but not limited to fluxes based on cesium-potassium aluminum<br>
fluoride based fluxes and cesium fluoroaluminate based fluxes. The flux may be any<br>
material capable of removing the oxide layer by chemical reaction prior to contact of<br>
the molten metals 16 and 20 with the divider member 14. When flux is used, lower<br>
molten metal temperatures should be used during casting to reduce the risk of melting<br>
the divider member 14 yet achieve strong adhesion of the components 38 and 40 to the<br>
divider member 14.<br>
A cross section of the ingot 10 produced in the apparatus 2 is shown in<br>
Fig. 2. The ingot 10 is depicted as having a rectangular configuration with the divider<br>
member 14 positioned centrally between the layers of components 38 and 40.<br>
However, the divider member 14 may be positioned off-center and may be as close as<br>
about 0.S inch from side surfaces 42 and 44 of the ingot 10. The divider member 14<br>
has a width between edges 46 and 48 thereof which is slightly smaller than the width<br>
of the ingot 10 between edges 49a and 49b. Edges 46 and 48 preferably are positioned<br>
about 0.1 to about 3 inches from the mold 4 and are shown not to scale in Figs. 2 and<br>
6-8. The cooling rates are highest near the surface of the ingot 10, and the molten<br>
metals 16 and 20 rapidly solidify at the surface of the ingot. The rapid solidification of<br>
molten metals 16 and 20 around the edges 46 and 48 minimizes opportunities for<br>
mixing of the molten metals 16 and 20. Nevertheless, some minimal mixing may<br>
enhance adhesion of the solid components 38 and 40 together. In any event, the edges<br>
49a and 49b of the ingot 10 are typically trimmed off during rolling to eliminate edge<br>
cracking so these areas of intermixing around the edges 46 and 48 of the divider<br>
member 14 generally are discarded.<br>
The thickness of the divider member 14 may range between about 0.07<br>
inch to about 0.25 inch (referred to as a sheet) or over about 0.25 inch to about 6<br>
inches thick (occasionally referred to as a shlate when up to one inch thick and<br>
generally referred to as a plate when up to 6 inches thick). The thickness of the divider<br>
member 14 preferably is about 0.5 to about 6% of the thickness of the ingot 10, more<br>
preferably about 1 to about 3% of the thickness of the ingot 10. A thinner divider<br>
member 14 may be used when the risk of melting of the divider member 14 is low<br>
and/or the desired metallurgical or structural properties of the ingot 10 dictate that the<br>
layer 14 has a minimal thickness. Conversely, a thicker divider member 14 may<br>
provide a more significant barrier to mixing of the molten metals 16 and 20 and may<br>
serve as one layer in a multi-layered ingot.<br>
If the divider member 14 transfers heat too rapidly out of the solidifying<br>
metals 16 and 20, the resultant components 38 and 40 may be prone to cracking.<br>
Hence, when the divider member 14 is over about 0.25 inch thick., it may be desirable<br>
to preheat the divider member 14 to within about 400°C of the temperature of the<br>
molten metals 16 and 20 thereby reducing the rate of heat transfer through the divider<br>
member 14.<br>
Generally, the divider member 14 has a melting point of at least<br>
610° C. The divider member 14 may be an aluminum alloy and preferably contains at<br>
least about 97% aluminum and has a high solidus temperature such as an AA 1000<br>
series alloy. Other suitable materials for the divider member 14 are composite<br>
products containing layers of aluminum alloys, stainless steel, nickel alloys, titanium<br>
alloys, magnesium alloys and combinations thereof that are clad, plated or coated<br>
thereto. The chemistry of the divider member 14 may be selected to improve the<br>
corrosion resistance of the final product being cast. For example, the addition of Zn to<br>
the divider member 14 makes the divider member 14 more electrochemically negative<br>
than at least one of the components 38 and 40. This results in galvanic protection,<br>
whereby the Zn enriched areas (the divider member 14 and the portion of components<br>
38 and 40 into which Zn has diffused) sacrificially protect the more cathodic alloys of<br>
components 38 and 40. The divider member 14 may define a plurality of small holes<br>
to allow some wetting between the molten metals 16 and 20 without significant<br>
intermixing. Alternatively, the divider member 14 may be a screen produced from<br>
iron, titanium, molybdenum or alloys thereof. Suitable screens are 14x18 mesh about<br>
0.01 inch thick or 32x32 mesh about 0.006 inch thick.<br>
The molten metals 16 and 20 each may be the same or different and<br>
each is preferably an aluminum alloy and may be an alloy of the AA series 1000, 2000,<br>
3000,4000, 5000,6000, 7000, or 8000. Other suitable metals may include magnesium<br>
alloys. For products in which one of the molten metals requires a specialized alloy, the<br>
other molten metal may have a high scrap alloy content. The low value scrap metal<br>
may be simultaneously cast with a thinner layer of the specialized alloy to produce<br>
high value products with a specialized surface such as reflector sheet, anodized<br>
products, architectural products and the like.<br>
The temperature of the first molten metal 16 may be about equal to the<br>
temperature of the second molten metal 20, or the temperatures of the first and second<br>
molten metals 16 and 20 may differ by up to about 150°C. Selection and control of the<br>
temperatures of the molten metals 16 and 20 during casting is critical, particularly<br>
when flux is not used. When no flux is used to remove the oxide on the divider<br>
member 14, the selection of molten metal temperatures should be such that the<br>
temperature of the divider member 14 rises above the liquidus temperature of the<br>
molten metals 16 and 20.<br>
When a flux is used or when the material of the divider member 14 is<br>
selected such that the oxide is disrupted prior to contacting the molten metals 16 and<br>
20 or when the presence of an oxide on the surfaces of the divider member 14 is not<br>
detrimental to achieving a strong bond, lower molten metal temperatures may be used<br>
and the divider member 14 does not necessarily need to reach the liquidus<br>
temperatures of the molten metals 16 and 20. In fact, it is desirable that the divider<br>
member 14 does not reach the liquidus temperature(s) because the divider member 14<br>
remains protected from the molten metals 16 and 20 by the metal that initially<br>
solidifies onto the divider member 14. In any case, the molten metal temperatures<br>
cannot be so high as to cause complete melting of the divider member 14. Some<br>
melting of the divider member 14 is acceptable, but complete melting of the divider<br>
member 14, even locally (i.e. a "bum through"), is undesired. The temperatures for<br>
this process depend on the chemistries of the molten metals 16 and 20 and of the<br>
divider member 14.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the present invention may also be used to<br>
produce a composite ingot having a single cast layer with a layer of divider metal;. In<br>
system 2', the divider member 14 may be delivered into the mold 4 at a location<br>
adjacent to the wall of the mold 4 and the molten metal 16 is delivered into the mold 4<br>
via the trough 18. The metal 16 begins to solidify in semi-solid zone 28 and ultimately<br>
solidifies as component 38 bound to the divider member 14 in manner similar to the<br>
solidification of metal 16 described above to yield an ingot 10'. This embodiment of<br>
the invention allows for production of an ingot 10 having a solid layer 14 bound to a<br>
cast layer 38 which avoids the prior art roll bonding processes. Flux may be applied to<br>
the surface of the divider member 14 which contacts the molten metal 16 in the system<br>
2' or to the surface of pool of molten metal 16 as described above. The divider<br>
member 14 and component 38 of the ingot 10' may be selected from the same<br>
materials listed above for ingot 10.<br>
The method of the present invention may also be used to cast more than<br>
two molten metals. For example, in the apparatus 50 shown in Fig. 5, two divider<br>
members 14 and 52 may be delivered into the direct chill mold 4 while molten metals<br>
16,20, and 53 are delivered into the mold via respective troughs 18,22, and 54.<br>
Casting of an ingot 60 from three separate molten metals 16,20, and 53 is performed<br>
in a manner similar to that described above. The molten metal 16 solidifies first at<br>
locations 24 (adjacent the mold 4) and 32 (adjacent the divider member 14), while<br>
molten metal 20 solidifies first at locations 34 (adjacent the divider member 14) and<br>
location 55 (adjacent the divider member 52). Molten metal 53 first solidifies at<br>
location 56 (adjacent the divider member 52) and location 57 (adjacent the mold 4).<br>
The solidifying metals 16, 20, and 53 form respective semi-solid zones 28,30 and 58.<br>
The locations 24, 32,34, 55,56, and 57 may be at the same height as each other or at<br>
different heights from the bottom block 12. The resultant product includes three cast<br>
layers 38,40, and 62 separated from each other by divider members 14 and 52 as<br>
shown in Fig. 6. The divider members 14 and 52 are positioned within the mold in the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 5 similar to divider<br>
member 14 of Fig. 1. The distance between the divider members 14 and 52 is selected<br>
based on the desired thicknesses of the components 38,40, and 62 in the ingot 60 and<br>
the size of the mold 4. The embodiment shown in Figs. 5 and 6 relates to<br>
simultaneous casting of three alloys with divider layers interspersed between, thereby<br>
creating a five-layer product. This is not meant to be limiting. More than three alloys<br>
may be simultaneous cast according to the present invention in rectangular<br>
configurations or in other configurations by using other shapes for the mold (e.g.<br>
square or oval) and non-planar divider members.<br>
Additional layers of metal may be bonded to the cast multi-layered<br>
ingots 10 and 60 resulting in the products 70 and 80 shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Product<br>
70 includes the ingot 10 and a pair of metal layers 72 roll bonded to the ingot 10.<br>
Product 80 includes the ingot 60 with a metal layer 82 roll bonded thereto. Products<br>
70 and 80 each may have one or two respective layers 72 or 82. When two layers 72<br>
are included as shown in Fig. 7, the metal of those layers may be the same or different<br>
from each other. The layers 72 and 82 may also be multi-component products<br>
produced according to the present invention or produced by conventional roll bonding<br>
practices.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is borne out when a<br>
multi-layered metal ingot produced according to the present invention is subsequently<br>
rolled, for example, into a plate or sheet product. In conventional roll bonded ingots,<br>
the thickness of a clad layer at the ends of the ingot often times becomes unacceptably<br>
thin during the rolling process. The edges of the resulting coil made from the<br>
composite ingot must be trimmed and scrapped so that the clad layer is uniformly thick<br>
across the width of the coil. Edge trimming of about 4 inches (for about 3-5%<br>
cladding) to about 8 inches (for about 10-15% cladding) is typical for conventional roll<br>
bonded brazing sheet. Such scrap losses can be minimized in the present invention by<br>
producing an ingot 90 as shown in Fig. 9 which has an arcuately shaped divider<br>
member 92 with metals 94 and 96 cast on opposing sides thereof. The cast metal 96<br>
(corresponding to a conventional clad layer) is thickest at the edges of the ingot 90.<br>
Upon rolling the ingot 90 to a plate 90', the divider member 92' flattens and the cast<br>
metals 94' and 96' are substantially uniformly thick as shown in Fig. 10. The divider<br>
member 92 may be tapered or bent into other configurations to locally achieve<br>
differing thickness of the metals cast on opposing sides thereof.<br>
The present invention may also be used to produce cylindrical products<br>
(e.g., a billet) of multiple alloys. The embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 11<br>
and 12 includes an apparatus 100 having a cylindrical mold 104 defining a water<br>
chamber 106 and a slit 108 through which water is emitted directly onto the surface of<br>
an ingot 110 emerging from the mold 104. The cast ingot 110 seats on a circular<br>
bottom block 112 traveling in the direction of arrow B. A tubular divider member 114<br>
is fed into the mold 104 and acts as a barrier between molten metal 116 fed from<br>
trough 118 on the outside of the tubular divider member 114 and molten metal 120 fed<br>
from another trough (not shown) on the inside of the tubular divider member 114.<br>
Delivery of the divider member 114 and movement of the bottom block 112 are<br>
controlled as described above regarding the apparatus 2. The tubular divider member<br>
114 may define a longitudinal slot 122 to ease access of the molten metal 120 into the<br>
divider member 114 during casting. Particularly during startup, the molten metal 120<br>
may be delivered into the tubular divider member 114 via the slot 122 near the bottom<br>
block 112 instead of pouring the molten metal 120 into the tubular divider member<br>
114 which can result in turbulence of the molten metal 120. The slot 122 is<br>
sufficiently narrow (e.g. about 1 to about 20 inches wide, depending on the size of the<br>
billet being cast) and may extend down into the molten pools of metals 116 and 120 to<br>
prevent excessive mixing between the molten metals 116 and 120 in the vicinity of the<br>
slot 122. Molten metal 116 first solidifies adjacent the mold 104 at region 124 and<br>
molten metal 120 first solidifies adjacent the tubular divider member 114 at region<br>
126. An annular semi-solid zone 128 forms below the level of the first solidification<br>
region 124, and a cylindrical semi-solid zone 130 forms below the level of the region<br>
126. Upon complete solidification, the metals 116 and 120 form respective solid<br>
components 138 and 140 separate by the tubular divider member 114. A cross-section<br>
of the billet 110 produced in the apparatus 100 is shown in Fig. 13.<br>
The present invention provides significant improvements over<br>
conventional clad products. The cladding ratio of roll bonded products is generally a<br>
maximum of 35%, i.e. the interface between roll bonded layers can generally be no<br>
greater than about 35% of the distance from either face of the ingot. In the present<br>
invention, the only limitation on the location of cast layers is that a cast layer is at least<br>
about 1 inch thick to allow for distribution of molten metal across the width of the<br>
ingot. The alloys which may be bonded together using the present invention are much<br>
more numerous than those which may be reliably and/or economically roll bonded<br>
together. Product quality is improved in the elimination of roll bonding blisters. The<br>
productivity of a hot mill used to initially breakdown or roll an ingot produced<br>
according to the present invention is also significantly increased as the many sealing<br>
passes may be eliminated.<br>
Although the invention has been described generally above, the<br>
following particular examples give additional illustrations of the products and process<br>
steps typical of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-3<br>
In each of Examples 1-3, a sheet of AA 1350 (20 inches wide, 0.375<br>
inch thick, and 24 inches long) was positioned in the center of 12 inch x 22 inch mold<br>
spanning the width with a gap of about 1 inch between the edge of the sheet and the<br>
mold walls. In each Example, a melt A of the alloy listed in Table 1 was poured into<br>
the mold on one side of the sheet and a melt B of the alloy B listed in Table 1 was<br>
poured into the mold on the other side of the sheet. In Example 3, flux was applied to<br>
the side of the sheet which contacted melt A. The metals were cast on opposing sides<br>
of the sheet while the bottom block with sheet seated thereon was lowered at a rate of<br>
2.75 inches per minute. A 12 inch x 22 inch x about 42 inch ingot having sheet of AA<br>
1350 bonded between a layer of alloy A and a layer of alloy B was produced.<br><br>
A block was sectioned from the ingot of Example 1 and was rolled (hot<br>
and cold) without any delaminating along the interface between the AA 1350 sheet and<br>
the cast layers of AA 3003 and 7051. A photograph of a horizontal cut through the<br>
ingot appears in Fig. 14. A close-up photomicrograph of the interface between the<br>
layers of AA alloy 3003 and modified AA alloy 7051 showing minimal erosion of the<br>
sheet appears in Fig. 15. A portion of the ingot was hot rolled to 0.250 inch (shown in<br>
Fig. 16) and subsequently cold rolled to 0.005 inch (shown in Fig. 17).<br>

light in Fig. 20 after etching in barkers etch to illustrate the microstructural details of<br>
the interface.<br>
