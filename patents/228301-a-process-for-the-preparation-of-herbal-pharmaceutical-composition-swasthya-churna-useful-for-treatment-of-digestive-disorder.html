a)	Cleaning, washing, drying and roasting the ingredients of Group A as herein described<br>
b)	Washing drying, grinding, roasting the ingredients of Group B as herein described,<br>
c)	Mixing by course grinding the salts of Group C as herein described<br>
d)	Mixing all the ingredients of Group A, B and C in a rotary mixer drum for 1 hour in ratio 40:47:13.<br>
e)	Final grinding of the mixture obtained in step d to get the desired product.<br>
Detailed description of the invention :-<br>
