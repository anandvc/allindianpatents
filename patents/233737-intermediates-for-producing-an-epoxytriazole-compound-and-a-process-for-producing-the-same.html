DESCRIPTION<br>
PFOCESS FOR PRODUCING EPOXYTRIAZOLE COMPOUNDS<br>
AND THEIR INTERMEDIATES<br>
TECHNICAL HELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing epoxytriazole<br>
compounds useful as synthetic intermediates of antifungal agents.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An epoxytriazole compound represented by the formula (VII) (hereinafter, also<br>
referred to as an epoxytriazole compound (VII)):<br><br>
wherein Ar represents a difluorophenyl group,<br>
is a useful compound which is suited for use as a synthetic intermediate of an antifungal<br>
agent (see, for example JP H04-356471-A).<br>
Various processes for producing an epoxytriazole compound (VII) have hitherto been proposed (see, for example, JP H04-356471-A, EP 421600-A, JP H05-230038-A, "Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin", The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, 1993, Vol. 41, No. 6, p. 1035-1042, etc.) and they are processes using a compound represented by the formula (1) (hereinafter, also referred to as the compound (1)) in which a hydroxyl group is protected with a tetrahydropyranyl group, as a raw material, as shown in the following scheme:<br><br><br>
wherein Ar represents a difluorophenyl group.<br>
However, the compound (1) as a common raw material for these production processes is hardly purified by recrystallization because it is in liquid state at normal temperature and is a mixture of two diastereomers. Furthermore, it is difficult to purify by distillation because a tetrahydropyranyl group, as a protective group, is easily eliminated by heat.<br>
Pharmaceutical products are obligated to be produced under severe quality control in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (hereinafter abbreviated to GMP) so as to secure safety. However, as described above, the compound (1) as a starting material of a conventional method is hardly purified from an industrial point of view, and thus it is difficult to control the purity thereof. Therefore, there was a problem of quality control in the production of the epoxytriazole compound (VH) which is an important synthetic intermediate in accordance with GMP.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel process capable of producing an epoxytriazole compound (VII) as a synthetic intermediate of a pharmaceutical product under proper quality control.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an intermediate which is useful in such a production process.<br><br>

Toluene (100 ml), THF (200 ml) and triethylamine (29.4 g, 0.29 mol, 1.5 eq.) were poured into the mixture obtained in (c) and methanesulfonyl chloride (26.7 g, 0.23 mol, 1.1 eq.) was slowly added dropwise at 10 to 20 °C. After stirring for 30 minutes, the reaction mass was cooled to 0 to 10 °C, 15% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (155 g, 0.58 mol, 3 eq.) was added thereto and the mixture was stirred for 1 hours. The reaction mass was allowed to stand, the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with toluene (100 ml). 5% brine was added to the combined organic layers, the mixture was neutralized to pH to 7 with 35% hydrochloric acid and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with 5% brine (100 ml). Anhydrous magnesium sulfate and activated carbon were added, the mixture was filtered and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Toluene (23 ml) was added thereto and the product was crystallized to obtain (2R,3S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-<br><br>
[(lH-l3294-triazol-l-yl)methyl]oxirane as white solid. Yield: 23.7 g, 48.7% (based on (2R)-2' ,4' -difluoro-2-(l' -methoxy-1' -methylethoxy)propiophenone).<br>

A solution of the mixture of (2R53R)-3-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2"(l'-methoxy-l7-methylethoxy)butane and its stereoisomer (2R,3S) form obtained in Example 6(a) (78.0 g, 0.19 mol) in DMF (50 ml) was added dropwise tehreto over 50 minutes. After reacting for about four and half hours at 85 to 90°C, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixed solution of water (500 ml) and toluene (200 ml) and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was further extracted twice with toluene (100 ml). The combined organic layers were washed twice with water (100 ml) to obtain a solution of a mixture of(2R,3R&gt;2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(l-methoxy-l-methylethoxy)-l-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2-butanol and its stereoisomer (2R,3S) form in toluene, (b): (2R,3R)-2-(254-difluorophenyl)-1-(1H-1,2,4,-triazol-1-yl)-2,3-butanediol<br>
Methanol (20 ml) and 5% hydrochloric acid (2 ml) were added to the toluene solution obtained in (a) and the mixture was stirred for about 1 hour at 19 °C. The mixture was neutralized with 15% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.67 g) and the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to about half volume to obtain a solution of mixture of (2R,3R)-2-(234-difluorophenyl)-l-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2,3-butanediol and its stereoisomer (2R,3S) form in toluene (about 260 g). (c): (2R,3S)-2-(2,4-difluoropte1-(1H-1,2,4,-triazol-1-yl)methyl)oxirane<br>
THF (100 ml) and triethylamine (29.4 g, 0.29 mol, 1.5 eq.) were poured into the toluene solution obtained in (b) and then methanesulfonyl chloride (26,7 g, 0.23 mol, 1.1<br><br>
eq.) was added dropwise over 25 minutes at 10 to 20°C. After stirring for 20 minutes, disappearance of the raw material in the reaction solution was confirmed. Thereafter, the reaction mass was cooled to 10°C, 15% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (155 g, 0.58 mol, 3 eq.) was added dropwise over 20 minutes and then the mixture was stirred for 40 minutes. The reaction mass was allowed to stand, the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with toluene (100 ml and 50 ml). 5% Brine 100ml was added to the combined organic layers, the mixture was neutralized to pH to 7 with 35% hydrochloric acid (about 27.9 g) and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with 5% brine (100 ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and activated carbon and decolorized. After filtering, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, toluene (29 ml) was added thereto and the product was crystallized. 25.6 g of (2R,3S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3.methyl-2-[(lH-l,2?4«triazol-l-yl)methyl]oxirane was obtained as white solid. Yield: 52.6%.<br>
The compound (I) in which a protective group for a hydroxyl group is (1-methoxy-l-methyl)ethyl group can be crystallized at normal temperature. The compound (I) is a single substance and therefore, it is possible to purify by recrystallization, whereas the conventional compound (1) protected with 2-tetrahydropyranyl group is a diastereomer mixture. Also, when the compound (I) protected with a (l-methoxy-l-methyl)ethyl group was subjected to epoxidation reaction, it is possible to accomplish the same stereo-selectivity as using a pervious compound (1).<br>
Consequently, it becomes possible to use a material having high purity and to produce an epoxytriazole compound (VII) under proper quality control in accordance with GMP more advantageously than the prior art.<br><br>
