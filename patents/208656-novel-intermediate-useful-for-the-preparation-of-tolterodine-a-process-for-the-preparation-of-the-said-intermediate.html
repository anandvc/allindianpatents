INTRODUCTION;<br>
The present invention relates to novel N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-Hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl propionamide. The novel N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-Hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-Phenyl propionamide has the formula (1)<br><br>
(1)<br>
The novel N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-Hydroxy-5-methyl phenyl)-3-PhenyI propionamide is useful as an intermediate for the preparation of tolterodine of the formula (VII) as<br>
hydrochloride salt. <br>
Tolterodine hydrochloride on resolution with L(+)tartaric acid by conventional methods yields R- tolterodine-L-tartrate of the formula (VIII)<br><br>
\ -	/<br>
R" tolterodine-L-tartrate of the formula (VIII) is useful in treating urinary incontinence<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Two methods for the preparation of R- tolterodine-L-tartrate of the formula (VIII) have been disclosed in EP-0325571 (1989). This process has been illustrated in the scheme shown in Fig 1<br><br><br><br>
This method comprises the reaction of 6-methyl-4-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2 H-1-benzopyran<br>
of the formula (1) with methyl iodide and potassium carbonate in refluxing acetone<br>
methanol gives	3-(2-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-Phenylpropionic acid methyl ester<br>
of the formula (II), which on reduction with lithium aluminum hydride to the corresponding propanol of the formula (III). The reaction of the compound of the formula (III) with tosyl chloride and pyridine yields the tosylate of the formula (IV), which by condensation with diisopropylamine of the formula (V) in hot acetonitrile is converted into the tertiary amine of the formula (VI). Finally, this compound is treated with borontribromide in dichloromethane to afford the Tolterodine of the formula (VII) as a racemic mixture, which is resolved with L-(+)-tartaric acid This method suffers from the following drawbacks,<br>
1.	It involves the usage of boron tribromide solution for the preparation of compounds of formula (Vn). Boron tribronude is very corrosive, moisture sensitive, toxic and it's availability on commercial scale is very difficult<br>
2.	Second reagent for the preparation of the compound of the formula (VTI) is pyridine hydrochloride at a temperature in the range of 200-205°C. These high temperatures are not possible for scale-up batches. Attempted batches resulted in tarry materials which are difficult to separate from product with quantitative yields.<br>
3.	The process involves pyridine as a solvent for the preparation of the compound of the formula (IV) which is obnoxious and difficult to handle for commercial batches<br>
4.	The preparation of the compound of the formula (VI) involves special equipment i.e., pressure bottle at 80°C for 4-6 days<br>
5.	The use of lithium aluminum hydride in diethyl ether is an inflammable step.<br>
Second method is illustrated in the scheme shown in Fig 2<br><br><br><br>
This method comprises the reaction of 3-(2-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl propionic acid of the formula (IX) with thionyl chloride gives 3-(2-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl propionyl chloride of the formula (X), which on reaction with diisopropylamine gives corresponding amide of formula (XI). The reduction of compound of formula (XI) with lithium aluminum hydride in diethyl ether solvent gives corresponding amine of formula(VI), Finally this compound is treated with borontribromide in dichloromethane to afford the tolterodine of the formula (VII) as a racemic mixture, which is resolved with L-(+)tartaric acid.<br>
This method suffers from the following draw backs :<br>
1.	By this process the compound of formula (VI) is obtained in 89% purity.<br>
2.	SO fumarate salt formation and its liberation is necessary to purify the compound of formula (VI) which adds further steps to the process thus making total process multi-step and low yielding<br>
3.	It also involves borontribromide (or) pyridinium chloride for the preparation of the compound of formula (VII) which cannot be used for commercial production.<br>
4.	It involves lithium aluminum hydride in diethyl ether for the preparation of the compound of the formula (VI) which is highly inflammable.<br><br>
Another method has been described in WO9829402A1 (1998). This is illustrated in the scheme shown in Fig -3<br><br><br>
This process comprises the reduction of 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2-H-benzopyan-2-one of the formula (1) with lithium tri-tert-butoxy alumino hydride (LITTBAL) gives 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2-H-benzopyan-2-ol of the formula (II). For this reduction two other reducing agents that is diisobutylaluminohydride (DIBAL) and sodiumbismethoxyethoxyalumino hydride (VTRIDE) are also claimed. The compound of formula (II) on reductive amination with 5% Pd-C and diisopropylamine in pressure bottle gives racemic tolterodine of formula (VII) which is resolved with L-(H-)tartaric acid.<br>
The synthetic route outlined in the patent is afflicted by a serious draw back, namely he use of DIBAL / LITTBAL as the reduction reagent which works in stoichiometric amount with respect to lactone at low temperature, in addition it is sensitive to air and moisture. VITRIDE is also claimed as reducing agent but, experiments realized that diol (3) is obtained as byproduct along with pure lactol (XII) which is difficult to separate and became a potential impurity in that process.<br><br><br>
Yet another method has been described in organic process research and development 2002, 6, 379,383. This is illustrated in the scheme shown in Fig 4<br><br>
P-cresol of formula (Xm) on reaction with phenyl acetylene of formula (XIV) gives l-[(2-Hydroxy-5-methyl)phenyl]-l-phenyl ethylene of the formula (XV), The compound of formula (XV) on hydroformylation with syngas in presence of rhodium catalyst at 100 atm. Pressure at 80-100oC for 24 -72 hours gives 3,6-dihydro-6-methyl4-phenyl-2H-benzopyran-2-ol of the formula (XVII). The compound of formula (XVII) on reductive amination with 5% Pd-C and diisopropylamine in pressure bottle gives racemic tolterodine of formula (VII)<br>
This process is described in 1-gram scale. This is not adaptable for multi-kilogram scale as it involves the following<br>
1.	Very expensive rhodium catalyst.<br>
2.	Specially designed high-pressure vessel.<br><br>
In J. Org. Chem 1998, 63  8067 - 8070 a process for an asymmetric synthesis via copper assisted   asymmetric conjugate addition of aryl grignard reagents to 3-phenyl-l-prop-2-enoyl-oxazolidinones is described. This is illustrated by Fig-5 Fig-5<br><br><br>
The oxazolidinone of formula (XVIII) on conjugate addition with l-benzyloxy-2.bromo-4-methyl benzene of formula (XIX) in copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex presence yields (5S)-phenyl-(3R)-(2-benzyloxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanoyl-2-oxazolidinone of formula (XX). The compound of formula (XX) is hydrolysed with lithium hydroxide to yield (3R)-(2-benzyloxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-propanoic acid of formula (XXI). Compound of formula (XXI) on reaction with N,N-diisopropyl amine yields N,N-diisopropyl-(3R)-(2-benzyloxy-5-methyl phenyl)-3-phenyl propane amide of formula (XXII). The compound of formula (XXII) on hydrogenation yields tolterodine of formula (VII)<br>
This process is described in milligram scale. This cannot be adaptable for multi-kilogram scale because of the special reagents and conditions.<br>
It is very important to examine a process of preparing the compound of the formula (VII) from the point of industrial applicability whether the procedure fulfills the following requirements,<br>
1.	The starting materials for the process are easily available and as cheap as possible.<br>
2.	The use of harmful reagents are avoided during the course of the process.<br>
3.	The process should be safe from the point of environmental protection.<br>
4.	The formation of by-products and ballast materials, which cannot be used or processed further, should be minimized during the course of the process.<br>
5.	The reaction vessels generally used in pharmaceutical and chemical industry should be applicable for the carrying out the process. In other words there should not be any special or complicated or sophisticated apparatus required for carrying out the process.<br>
6.	It is also very important, that the process should result in the formation of pure final product, which does not need further expensive purification.<br>
All of the processes described above in the prior art do not fulfill one or other of the above conditions.<br>
Therefore we directed our R &amp; D program to develop an improved process for the preparation of tolterodine of the formula VII taking into consideration the above mentioned<br><br>
requirements. The aim being to provide a new environmentally protective, safe, industrially<br>
applicable process, which was devoid of the insufficiencies of the known procedures and<br>
makes possible the synthesis of optically pure compound of the formula VII in high yields<br>
and was easily realizable industrially.<br>

We also found further that HBr - acetic acid used in the demethylation step gave better quality and yield than the boron bromide method (30-35% higher overall yield)<br><br>
