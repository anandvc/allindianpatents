METHOD FOR RECOVERING MOLYBDENUM AND METHOD FOR<br>
PRODUCING CATALYST<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for recovering solution containing<br>
at least molybdenum (recovered molybdenum-containing liquid) or precipitate<br>
containing at least molybdenum (recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate)<br>
from a molybdenum-containing material comprising at least molybdenum, A<br>
element (phosphorus and/or arsenic) and X element (at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium), and a<br>
method for producing a catalyst using the recovered molybdenum-containing<br>
liquid and/or the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
The molybdenum-containing material comprising at least molybdenum, A<br>
element (phosphorus and/or arsenic) and X element (at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium) is widely<br>
known for its effectiveness as a heteropolyacid based catalyst which is used in<br>
producing, for example, methacrylic acid through oxidative dehydrogenases of<br>
isobutyric acid or methacrylic acid through gas-phase oxidation of methacrolein.<br>
It is also used in a process for producing methacrylic acid through direct<br>
gas-phase oxidation of isobutylene.<br>
[0003]<br>
Generally, in an industrial gas-phase oxidation reaction, a catalyst is used for<br><br>
a certain period of time and after being used for the period of time, the catalyst is<br>
taken out from a reactor and replaced by a new one. The spent catalyst thus<br>
taken out from the reactor contains many useful elements as raw materials for<br>
producing a catalyst, such as molybdenum, potassium, rubidium and cesium.<br>
It is a very important subject from the economical point of view and from the<br>
viewpoint of reducing the load to environment to develop the technology for<br>
recovering and reusing these elements or recycling and reusing the spent<br>
catalyst.<br>
[0004]<br>
As a method for recovering catalyst components from a spent catalyst, a<br>
method is known, which comprises the step of thermally decomposing a<br>
heteropolyacid salt based spent catalyst with sodium hydroxide followed by<br>
contacting the resultant mixture with sodium type strongly acidic resin to<br>
selectively adsorb and separate cesium, rubidium and thallium or potassium,<br>
eluting the adsorbed elements with sulfuric acid and recovering these elements<br>
as sulfates of each element, and the step of recovering a heteropolyacid by<br>
treating the solution of the sodium salt of the heteropolyacid separated in the<br>
foregoing step with proton type strongly acidic ion-exchange resin (refer to, for<br>
example, JPH07-213.922-A1 (Patent document 1)).<br>
[0005]<br>
Further, as a method for regenerating a catalyst, a regenerating method of<br>
treating a spent catalyst used in producing methacrylic acid with hydrochloric<br>
acid (refer to, for example, JPS54-002.293-A1 (Patent document 2)), a<br>
regenerating method of treating the spent catalyst with a nitrogen- containing<br>
heterocyclic compound (refer to, for example, JPS60-232.247-A1 (Patent<br>
document 3)), a regenerating method of adding ammonium species and nitrate<br>
species to a deactivated catalyst (refer to, for example, JPS61 -283.352-A1<br>
(Patent document 4)), a regenerating method of treating the spent catalyst with<br><br>
inorganic ion exchanger such as crystalline antimonate (refer to, for example,<br>
JPH06-285,373-A1 (Patent document 5)) and the like are known.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, the recovering method disclosed in JPH07-213.922-A1 (Patent<br>
document 1) uses ion-exchange resin in two steps. In a recovering method<br>
using ion-exchange resin, it is necessary to lower the concentration of the<br>
element to be recovered in the solution to be treated for recovering.<br>
Consequently, it causes the problem that using ion-exchange resin in the two<br>
steps as in the above case results in increase in the area of equipment and the<br>
used amount of the ion-exchange resin, and hence, it is not economical.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, as the regenerating methods disclosed in JPS54-002,293-A1 (Patent<br>
document 2), JPS60-232.247-A1 (Patent document 3), JPS61-283.352-A1<br>
(Patent document 4) and JPH06-285.373-A1 (Patent document 5), there is a<br>
problem that a catalyst can be regenerated to a certain level but its yield of<br>
methacrylic acid using the regenerated catalyst is lower than that using a<br>
catalyst produced in a ordinary method.<br>
[0008]<br>
As a method which has solved these problems, there is a method in which a<br>
recovered spent catalyst is dispersed in water, and to the resultant dispersion,<br>
an alkali metal compound and aqueous ammonia are added, and then pH of the<br>
mixed liquid is adjusted to 6.5 or less to precipitate molybdenum together with<br>
phosphorus and arsenic and to recover them as a molybdenum-containing<br>
precipitate which is usable in producing a catalyst (refer to, for example, USP<br>
6,777,369 (Patent document 6)).<br>
[0009]<br>
However, the molybdenum-containing precipitate obtained by the method<br>
disclosed in USP 6,777,369 (Patent document 6) also contains phosphorus and<br><br>
arsenic which have been originally included in the raw material for recovering,<br>
and there is a restriction on using this precipitate directly for producing a new<br>
catalyst.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
Therefore, the problems of the present invention are to provide a method for<br>
recovering solution containing at least molybdenum (recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing liquid) or precipitate containing at least molybdenum<br>
(recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate), which can be used in<br>
producing a catalyst as well as fresh molybdenum compounds, from a<br>
molybdenum-containing material comprising at least molybdenum, A element<br>
(phosphorus and/or arsenic) and X element (at least one selected from the<br>
group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium), in particular,<br>
from a recovered spent catalyst, and to provide a method for producing a<br>
catalyst using the recovered molybdenum-containing liquid or the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing precipitate as a raw material of the catalyst.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM<br>
[0011]<br>
To solve the problems described above, the present inventors have<br><br>
intensively researched and have found that by dispersing a<br>
molybdenum-containing material which is a raw material for recovering<br>
molybdenum in an alkaline solution, and then by making a<br>
magnesium-containing compound act on the dispersion at a specified range of<br>
pH, it is possible to recover molybdenum in a state which can be used in<br>
producing various kinds of catalysts containing molybdenum and thus have<br>
completed the present invention.<br>
[0012]<br>
Namely, the present invention resides in a method for recovering<br>
molybdenum comprising the steps of:<br>
1)	dispersing a molybdenum-containing material which contains at least<br>
molybdenum, A element (phosphorus and/or arsenic) and X element (at least<br>
one selected from the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and<br>
thallium) in water and adding alkali to make pH of the resultant mixed liquid 8 or<br>
more;<br>
2)	adjusting pH of the resultant mixed liquid to fall within the range of from 6 to<br>
12 followed by adding a compound containing magnesium and aqueous<br>
ammonia to form a precipitate containing at least magnesium and A element;<br>
and<br>
3)	separating the precipitate containing at least magnesium and A element<br>
formed in the step 2) from a solution containing at least molybdenum (recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing liquid).<br>
[0013]<br>
Moreover, the present invention resides in the above-mentioned method for<br>
recovering molybdenum, further comprising the step of:<br>
4)	forming a precipitate containing at least molybdenum by adjusting the pH of<br>
the recovered molybdenum-containing liquid to 3 or less with an addition of acid<br>
and separating the precipitate thus formed (recovered molybdenum-containing<br><br>
precipitate) from the solution.<br>
[0014]<br>
Further, the present invention resides in a method for producing a catalyst by<br>
using a recovered molybdenum-containing liquid a recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing precipitate which has been recovered by the<br>
above-mentioned methods for recovering molybdenum.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
According to the present invention, useful molybdenum can be recovered in<br>
the form of reusable solution or precipitate by an easy operation from a<br>
molybdenum-containing material which contains at least molybdenum, A<br>
element (phosphorus and/or arsenic) and X element (at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium), in particular,<br>
from a molybdenum-containing spent catalyst.<br>
[0016]<br>
Further, when the recovered molybdenum-containing liquid or precipitate<br>
produced in the present invention is used in producing a catalyst, it is possible<br>
not only that a molybdenum-containing spent catalyst can be used effectively,<br>
but also that a catalyst with the same yield of methacrylic acid can be obtained<br>
as in the case where a conventional raw material of molybdenum is used and<br>
the recovered molybdenum-containing material is not used. Moreover, it is<br>
advantageous that there is little limitation on a method for producing a catalyst<br>
because these solutions or precipitates do not practically contain A element<br>
(phosphorus and/or arsenic).<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0017]<br><br>
In the present invention, a molybdenum-containing material to be used in<br>
recovering molybdenum comprises at least molybdenum, A element and X<br>
element and, for example, a spent catalyst used in a reaction for producing<br>
methacrylic acid through gas-phase catalytic oxidation of methacrolein or in a<br>
reaction for producing methacrylic acid through oxidative dehydrogenation of<br>
isobutylic acid can be mentioned. In the case of these catalysts for producing<br>
methacrylic acid, those having a composition represented by the following<br>
formula (1) are preferable, and those having a composition represented by the<br>
following formula (2) are particularly preferable.<br>
[0018] <br>
Wherein, Mo and O represent molybdenum and oxygen, respectively; A<br>
represents phosphorus and/or arsenic; Y represents at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc,<br>

tungsten, manganese, silver, boron, silicon, aluminum, gallium, germanium, tin,<br>
lead, antimony, bismuth, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, indium, sulfur, selenium,<br>
tellurium, lanthanum and cerium; X represents at least one element selected<br>
from the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium; and<br>
subscripts a, b, c, d and e represent an atomic ratio of each element,<br>
respectively; when b is 12, a is in the range of from 0.1 to 3, c is in the range of<br>
from 0 to 3 and d is in the range of from 0.01 to 3 and e represents the atomic<br>
ratio of oxygen necessary for fulfilling the requirement of the valence of each<br>
element above.<br>
[0019] <br>
In the formula, Mo, Cu, V and O represent molybdenum, copper, vanadium<br>
and oxygen, respectively; A represents phosphorus and/or arsenic; Y"<br><br>
represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of iron,<br>
cobalt, nickel, zinc, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, titanium, chromium,<br>
tungsten, manganese, silver, boron, silicon, aluminum, gallium, germanium, tin,<br>
lead, antimony, bismuth, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, indium, sulfur, selenium,<br>
tellurium, lanthanum and cerium, preferably selected from iron, zinc, germanium,<br>
antimony, lanthanum and cerium; X represents at least one element selected<br>
from the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium,<br>
preferably selected from potassium, rubidium and cesium; and subscripts a, b,<br>
c', f, g, d and e represent an atomic ratio of each element, respectively; when b<br>
is 12, a is in the range of from 0.1 to 3, preferably from 0.5 to 3, c' is in the range<br>
of from 0 to 2.98, preferably from 0 to 2.5, f is in the range of from 0.01 to 2.99,<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 2, g is in the range of from 0.01 to 2.99, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 2 and d is in the range of from 0.01 to 3, preferably from 0.1 to 3 and e<br>
represents the atomic ratio of oxygen necessary for fulfilling the requirement of<br>
the valence of each element above, and besides, (c' + f + g) is in the range of<br>
from 0.02 to 3.<br>
[0020]<br>
Further, a catalyst from which molybdenum is recovered is not particularly<br>
limited and a spent catalyst used in a reaction for producing methacrylic acid is<br>
usually used, and a catalyst which has been stopped to use for certain reasons,<br>
a catalyst which has been drawn from a reactor in the middle of its use in a<br>
reaction and the like are also usable.<br>
[0021]<br>
(Step 1)<br>
A molybdenum-containing material which contains at least molybdenum, A<br>
element and X element is dispersed in water first, and then alkali is added to it.<br>
Amount of alkali to be added is such that pH of the resultant dispersion<br>
becomes 8 or more, preferably from 8.5 to 13. A kind of alkali to be used is not<br><br>
particularly limited and, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
cesium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and aqueous ammonia can be mentioned,<br>
and in particular, sodium hydroxide is preferable. Further, when a catalyst is<br>
totally or partially in a reduced state, it is preferable to oxidize it by calcinations<br>
in air, chlorination, hydrogen peroxide treatment or the like before the alkali<br>
addition, or by chlorination, hydrogen peroxide treatment or the like after the<br>
alkali addition.<br>
[0022]<br>
(Step 2)<br>
Then, the resultant liquid of molybdenum-containing material is previously<br>
adjusted for its pH to fall within the range of from 6 to 12, and to the resultant<br>
liquid, a compound containing magnesium and aqueous ammonia are added.<br>
Then, the resultant liquid is adjusted again for its pH to fall within the range of<br>
from 6 to 12 if needed, and a precipitate containing at least magnesium and A<br>
element is formed. It is preferable to remove insoluble materials by filtration or<br>
the like from the solution existing before the compound containing magnesium<br>
and aqueous ammonia are added. Amount of addition of the compound<br>
containing magnesium and ammonia when the precipitate is formed is<br>
preferably one mol or more of each component per one mol of A element.<br>
[0023]<br>
The compound containing magnesium to be used when the precipitate is<br>
formed is not particularly limited and magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate,<br>
magnesium nitrate or the like can be used.<br>
[0024]<br>
Further, pH of the liquid in the step 2 is from 6 to 12, preferably from 6.5 to 11,<br>
more preferably from 7 to10. When the pH of the liquid is less than 6, a<br>
precipitate is not formed or insufficient if formed so that an uptake of A element<br>
into the precipitate becomes insufficient as well as a rate of recovery of<br><br>
molybdenum becomes low because ammonium dodecamolybdophosphate is<br>
liable to precipitate, and hence, it is not preferable. On the other hand, when<br>
the pH of the liquid is more than 12, magnesium becomes magnesium<br>
hydroxide, and hence, an uptake of A element becomes insufficient.<br>
[0025]<br>
The compound to be used in adjusting pH of those liquids is not particularly<br>
limited and, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid,<br>
ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like can be mentioned,<br>
and among them, hydrochloric acid and ammonia are preferable.<br>
[0026]<br>
It is preferable to hold the liquid for a certain period of time after adding the<br>
compound containing magnesium and aqueous ammonia to form a precipitate.<br>
At this time, the holding time is preferably around from 0.5 to 24 hours, and<br>
temperature of the liquid is preferably around from room temperature to 90°C.<br>
While holding the liquid, it may be stood still, but preferably it is stirred.<br>
[0027]<br>
(Step 3)<br>
The precipitate containing at least magnesium and A element formed in the<br>
above-mentioned precipitate forming step is separated from a solution<br>
containing at least molybdenum (recovered molybdenum-containing liquid). A<br>
method for separating the precipitate from the solution is not particularly limited<br>
and general methods such as filtration separation method including gravity<br>
filtration, filtration under pressure, filtration under reduced pressure, filter press<br>
and the like or centrifugal separation method can be applied.<br>
[0028]<br>
(Step 4)<br>
The solution containing at least molybdenum (recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing liquid) obtained by separating the precipitate containing<br><br>
magnesium and A element can be used by itself as a raw material of<br>
molybdenum in the production of a catalyst, however, it is preferable to<br>
subsequently adjust pH of the solution to form a precipitate containing at least<br>
molybdenum (recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate).<br>
[0029]<br>
At the time of forming the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate, pH<br>
of the solution is preferably 3 or less, particularly preferably 2 or less. A<br>
compound to be used for adjusting pH of the solution is not particularly limited<br>
and, for example, strong acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and sulfuric<br>
acid can be mentioned, and among them, nitric acid or hydrochloric acid is<br>
preferable. After adjusting pH of the solution, it is preferable to hold the<br>
resultant solution for a certain period of time to form a precipitate. At this time,<br>
the holding time is preferably around from 0.5 to 24 hours, and temperature of<br>
the solution is preferably around from room temperature to 90°C. While<br>
holding the solution, it may be stood still, but preferably it is stirred.<br>
[0030]<br>
A method for separating the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate<br>
from its bottom is not particularly limited and general methods such as filtration<br>
separation method including gravity filtration, filtration under pressure, filtration<br>
under reduced pressure and filter press or centrifugal separation method can be<br>
used. Further, the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate may be<br>
washed to remove its impurities if necessary. In this case, the washing liquid is<br>
selected in view of use or solubility of the recovered molybdenum-containing<br>
precipitate and, for example, pure water, dilute aqueous solution of ammonium<br>
nitrate or ammonium chloride can be mentioned. As the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing precipitate after washed, each amount of sodium and<br>
chlorine contained in the precipitate is preferably 0.1 mole or less per 12 moles<br>
of molybdenum, more preferably 0.05 mole or less.<br><br>
[0031]<br>
When the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate is formed from the<br>
recovered molybdenum-containing liquid, the liquid may contain vanadium in<br>
some cases depending on a molybdenum-containing material which is a raw<br>
material for recovering. When the liquid or precipitate is used as a raw material<br>
for producing a catalyst, it is preferable to partially or totally remove vanadium<br>
from the solution depending on a composition of the catalyst to be produced. A<br>
method for removing vanadium from the liquid is not particularly limited and, for<br>
example, a method in which pH of the recovered molybdenum-containing liquid<br>
including vanadium other than molybdenum is adjusted first and vanadium is<br>
removed from the resultant liquid by adsorption with a weak basic<br>
anion-exchange resin or a method of precipitation separation by using<br>
ammonium chloride or ammonium sulfate can be mentioned. Time of<br>
removing vanadium is not particularly limited as long as it is located, after<br>
separating the precipitate containing magnesium and A element and before<br>
forming the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the present invention, the recovered molybdenum-containing liquid and/or<br>
the recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate thus obtained can be used as<br>
a raw material for producing a catalyst. Hereinafter, the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing liquid and the recovered molybdenum-containing<br>
precipitate are also expressed altogether as "recovered molybdenum-containing<br>
material". A state of the recovered molybdenum-containing material to be used<br>
in the production of catalyst is not particularly limited and any one of a solution<br>
state, a wet state or a dry state may be chosen. Further, when a state of oxide<br>
is desired to be used as a raw material of a catalyst, an oxide obtained by<br>
calcining these recovered molybdenum-containing materials, in particular, the<br>
recovered molybdenum-containing precipitate can be used. Calcining<br><br>
condition is preferably from 300 to 600°C under an atmosphere of<br>
oxygen-containing gas such as air, for 0.5 hour or more.<br>
[0033]<br>
(Production of catalyst)<br>
In the present invention, a method for producing a catalyst is not particularly<br>
limited and can be properly chosen from various methods such as<br>
coprecipitation, evaporation to dryness or mixing of oxides in accordance with a<br>
state of the recovered molybdenum-containing material which is used as a raw<br>
material.<br>
[0034]<br>
Further, in the method for producing a catalyst, the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material and/or its calcined material may be used alone,<br>
or if necessary, together with the other raw materials of molybdenum such as<br>
those which are recovered by a method other than the above-mentioned<br>
recovering method or produced from molybdenum ore (hereinafter, these are<br>
also expressed as "the other raw materials of molybdenum"). A method for<br>
producing a raw material of molybdenum other than the above-mentioned<br>
recovered molybdenum-containing material is not particularly limited and, for<br>
example, a method in which ammonium paramolybdate is obtained through<br>
calcining molybdenum ore, washing the resultant crude molybdenum trioxide<br>
with nitric acid followed by dissolving it with aqueous ammonia, refining the<br>
resultant solution, adjusting pH of the solution by nitric acid to obtain molybdic<br>
acid, dissolving again the molybdic acid with aqueous ammonia followed by<br>
concentration and crystallization or a method in which molybdenum trioxide is<br>
obtained through calcination of ammonium paramolybdate or molybdic acid can<br>
be mentioned. Moreover, a raw material other than the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material to be used in preparing a catalyst is not<br>
particularly limited and nitrates, carbonates, acetates, ammonium salts, oxides,<br><br>
halides or oxyacids of each element can be used in combination. For example,<br>
as a raw material of molybdenum, ammonium paramolybdate, molybdenum<br>
trioxide, molybdic acid, molybdenum chloride and the like can be used and as a<br>
raw material of phosphorus, phosphoric acid, phosphorus pentoxide,<br>
ammonium phosphate and the like can be used.<br>
[0035]<br>
As a practical method for preparing a catalyst, for example, a method in which<br>
a dried material of a slurry containing at least A element and X element together<br>
with the recovered molybdenum-containing material and the other raw materials<br>
of molybdenum mentioned above which is used if necessary are calcined or a<br>
method in which a dried mixture containing at least A element and X element<br>
together with the recovered molybdenum-containing material and the other raw<br>
materials of molybdenum mentioned above which is used if necessary are<br>
calcined can be mentioned. Further, in a method for producing a catalyst,<br>
when amounts of addition of raw materials containing elements of the catalyst<br>
components are adjusted in view of the amount of the impurities originating from<br>
the elements which are included in the recovered molybdenum-containing<br>
material to be used as a raw material, a supplemental amount of raw materials<br>
equivalent to shortage of counter ions contained in the raw materials may be<br>
added. For example, when an amount of addition of vanadium is adjusted by<br>
reducing the amount of addition of ammonium metavanadate, shortage of<br>
ammonium ion can be adjusted by supplemental addition of aqueous ammonia<br>
or when an amount of addition of potassium or cesium is adjusted by reducing<br>
the amount of addition of potassium nitrate or cesium nitrate, shortage of nitrate<br>
ion can be adjusted by supplemental addition of nitric acid.<br>
[0036]<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that ammonia is mixed when a<br>
catalyst is produced. A source of ammonia is not particularly limited and<br><br>
ammonia itself or its aqueous solution or ammonium salts of various acids may<br>
be used. Further, ammonia may be mixed as ammonium salts of molybdic acid<br>
or phosphoric acid. Amount of ammonia to be used is preferably 1 to 17 moles<br>
per 12 moles of molybdenum, particularly preferably 2 to 13 moles. As an<br>
ammonium salt, ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogencarbonate or<br>
ammonium nitrate can be mentioned. These salts may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more kinds and not particularly limited.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the present invention, a method for mixing ammonia is not particularly<br>
limited and, for example, a method in which aqueous ammonia is added after<br>
dispersing the recovered molybdenum-containing material in water or a method<br>
in which aqueous ammonia or ammonium nitrate is added after heating and<br>
stirring a liquid containing at least the recovered molybdenum-containing<br>
material, A element and X element under refluxing and cooling to a fixed<br>
temperature can be mentioned. Further, ammonia to be mixed may be the one<br>
contained in the recovered molybdenum-containing material. Using various<br>
raw materials containing ammonia component to be normally used in producing<br>
a catalyst can serve as an ammonia addition.<br>
[0038]<br>
Further, in the production of a catalyst of the present invention, when a step in<br>
the production proceeds via a state of solution or slurry, temperature of the<br>
solution or slurry may be the same as that in a normal method for producing a<br>
catalyst, in which the recovered molybdenum-containing material of the present<br>
invention is not used, but can be lower than that in the normal method in a part<br>
of the steps or in the entire steps. In that case, it is preferable to properly<br>
determine the temperature of the solution or slurry in view of a particle size<br>
distribution of the precipitated particles in the slurry, moldability of the obtained<br>
powder, pore size distribution of the catalyst or reaction performance of the<br><br>
catalyst, and the temperature is preferably 0 to 40°C, more preferably 0 to 30°C<br>
lower than that in the normal method.<br>
[0039]<br>
Further, a method for drying slurry is not particularly limited and a method<br>
using a box type dryer, a spray dryer, a drum dryer or the like is usable. In this<br>
case, the resultant dried material (catalyst precursor) is preferably powder in<br>
view of the subsequent molding. The dried material may be molded directly or<br>
after calcined. A method for molding is not particularly limited either and, for<br>
example, tablet molding, extrusion molding, granulation, supporting on carrier or<br>
the like can be mentioned. As a carrier of supported catalyst, for example,<br>
inert carriers such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina and silicon carbide can be<br>
mentioned. When molding is carried out, additives, for example, inorganic<br>
salts such as barium sulfate and ammonium nitrate, lubricants such as graphite,<br>
organic materials such as cellulose, starch, polyvinyl alcohol and stearic acid,<br>
hydroxide sols such as silica sol and alumina sol, inorganic fibers such as<br>
whisker, glass fiber and carbon fiber, or the like may be properly added with a<br>
view to controlling specific surface area, pore volume and pore-size distribution<br>
and improving mechanical strength of the molded articles.<br>
[0040]<br>
When a molded article is calcined, calcinations may be carried out either<br>
before the molded article being packed in a reactor or in the reactor in which the<br>
molded article has been packed. Calcining conditions can not be exactly said<br>
because they are variant depending on raw materials of a catalyst to be used, a<br>
catalyst composition, a preparing condition and the like. However, they are<br>
preferably from 300 to 500°C, more preferably from 300 to 450°C, under a flow<br>
of oxygen-containing gas such as air and/or inert gas, for 0.5 hour or more,<br>
more preferably from 1 to 40 hours.<br>
[0041]<br><br>
(Production of methacrylic acid)<br>
Hereinafter, a reaction condition in the case of producing methacrylic acid<br>
through gas-phase catalytic oxidation of methacrolein is explained.<br>
[0042]<br>
A reaction condition in the case that a reaction is carried out by using a<br>
catalyst produced by the method of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited and a publicly known reaction condition can be applied.<br>
[0043]<br>
In the gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction, feed gas containing at least<br>
methacrolein and molecular oxygen is contacted with a catalyst. Normally, a<br>
tubular reactor packed with a catalyst is used for reaction. Industrially, a<br>
multitubular reactor equipped with a lot of reaction tubes is used.<br>
[0044]<br>
Concentration of methacrolein in the feed gas can be changed in a wide<br>
range; however, it is preferably from 1 to 20% by volume, particularly preferably<br>
from 3 to 10% by volume. In raw methacrolein, impurities such as water and<br>
lower saturated aldehyde, which do not substantially exert influence on the<br>
reaction, are included in some cases, but those impurities originating from<br>
methacrolein are allowable.<br>
[0045]<br>
Molecular oxygen needs to be contained in the feed gas and the amount of<br>
molecular oxygen in the feed gas is preferably 0.4 to 4 times in moles as much<br>
as the amountof methacrolein, particularly preferably 0.5 to 3 times in moles.<br>
As a source of molecular oxygen in the feed gas, it is industrially profitable to<br>
use air, but oxygen-enriched air by pure oxygen can also be used, if necessary.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the feed gas is diluted with inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen and carbon dioxide or water vapor.<br>
[0046]<br><br>
Reaction pressure of the gas-phase catalytic oxidation is from normal<br>
pressure to several atmospheric pressure. Reaction temperature is preferably<br>
200 to 450°C, more preferably 250 to 400°C. Contact time of the feed gas with<br>
the catalyst is preferably 1.5 to 15 seconds, more preferably 2 to 7 seconds.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0047]<br>
Next, the present invention is explained by using examples. In these<br>
examples, "part(s)" means part(s) by mass. Further, quantitative analysis of<br>
elements (or molecules) contained in a material was carried out by ICP emission<br>
analysis or atomic absorption analysis. The analysis of the feed gas and<br>
products in the production of methacrylic acid was carried out by gas<br>
chromatography.<br>
[0048]<br>
A ratio of recovery of each element, conversion of methacrolein which is a raw<br>
material, selectivity to methacrylic acid produced and yield of methacrylic acid<br>
are defined as follows:<br>
[0049]<br>
a)	Ratio of recovery of each element:<br>
Ratio of recovery (% by mass) = (Wr / Ws) x 100<br>
Wherein Wr represents the amount by mass of an element contained in an<br>
obtained composition and Ws represents the amount by mass of an element<br>
contained in a composition used for recovery.<br>
[0050]<br>
b)	Conversion of methacrolein which is a raw material, selectivity to<br>
methacrylic acid produced and per pass yield of methacrylic acid:<br>
Conversion of methacrolein (mol%) = (B /A) x 100<br>
Selectivity to methacrylic acid (mol%) = (C / B) x 100<br><br>
Per pass yield of methacrylic acid (mol%) = (C / A) x 100<br>
Wherein A represents mole number of methacrolein supplied; B represents<br>
mole number of methacrolein reacted; and C represents mole number of<br>
methacrylic acid produced.<br>
[0051]<br>
Reference Example 1<br>
(Production of catalyst A for use in producing methacrylic acid)<br>
In 300 parts of pure water, 100 parts of ammonium paramolybdate, 4.4 parts<br>
of ammonium metavandate and 9.2 parts of cesium nitrate were dissolved at<br>
70°C. To the resultant solution, a solution obtained by dissolving 8.7 parts of<br>
85 mass% phosphoric acid in 10 parts of pure water was added and then 5.5<br>
parts of antimony trioxide was added and heated to 95°C with stirring, and a<br>
solution obtained by dissolving 1.1 parts of copper nitrate in 10 parts of pure<br>
water was added. Further, the resultant mixed liquid was stirred for 15 minutes<br>
at 95°C and evaporated to dryness with stirring under heating. The solid<br>
material thus obtained was dried for 16 hours at 130°C, and then pressure<br>
molded, and further, crushed, and particles which were passed through a 1.70<br>
mm-mesh opening sieve and kept on a 0.85 mm-mesh opening sieve were<br>
fractionated, and the resultant particles were heat treated at 380°C for 5 hours<br>
under a flow of air to obtain catalyst A (the composition exclusive of oxygen: PL6<br>
Moi2 Sb0.8 Cu0.i V0.8 CSi).<br>
[0052]<br>
(Test A of the production of methacrylic acid)<br>
The catalyst A was packed in a reactor and a mixed gas containing 5% by<br>
volume of methacrolein, 10% by volume of oxygen, 30% by volume of water<br>
vapor and 55% by volume of nitrogen was passed through it at a reaction<br>
temperature of 290°C and contact time of 3.6 seconds. As a result, conversion<br>
of methacrolein was 82.9 mol%, selectivity to methacrylic acid was 83.7 mol%<br><br>
and per pass yield of methacrylic acid was 69.3 mol%.<br>
[0053]<br>
Example 1<br>
(Recovery of molybdenum 1)<br>
A catalyst was produced in the same manner as in the production of catalyst A<br>
for use in producing methacrylic acid of Reference Example 1 (the composition<br>
exclusive of oxygen of the catalyst: P1.6 Mo12 Cs1) and by using this catalyst, the<br>
test A of the production of methacrylic acid was carried out for 2,000 hours and<br>
the spent catalyst was recovered. In 100 parts of the recovered catalyst, 56.3<br>
parts of molybdenum, 2.4 parts of phosphorus and 6.5 parts of cesium were<br>
contained. To 400 parts of pure water, 100 parts of the recovered catalyst was<br>
dispersed. To the resultant dispersion, 130 parts of 45 mass% sodium<br>
hydroxide aqueous solution was added and stirred for 3 hours at 60°C. The<br>
pH of the resultant solution was 12.3. The solution was neutralized to pH 7 by<br>
36 mass% hydrochloric acid, and a solution obtained by dissolving 20.5 parts of<br>
magnesium chloride hexahydrate in 50 parts of pure water and 4.5 parts of 29<br>
mass% aqueous ammonia were added, and further, the pH of the resultant<br>
solution was adjusted to 9 by adding 29 mass% aqueous ammonia, and kept at<br>
30°C for 3 hours with stirring, and precipitates were thus formed and the bottom<br>
liquid (recovered molybdenum-containing liquid) were separated by filtration.<br>
The pH of the recovered molybdenum-containing liquid thus obtained was<br>
adjusted to 1.0 by adding 36 mass% hydrochloric acid and the resultant solution<br>
was kept at 30°C for 3 hourawith stirring. The precipitate thus obtained was<br>
filtrated and washed by 2 mass% ammonium nitrate solution to obtain<br>
"recovered molybdenum-containing material 1". The recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material 1 contained 55.5 parts of molybdenum and 2.9<br>
parts of cesium. And, at this time, ratio of recovery of molybdenum was 98.6%<br>
by mass. Furthermore, phosphorus was not detected in the recovered<br><br>

was stirred for 15 minutes at 95°C, and then, evaporated to dryness with stirring<br>
under heating. The solid material thus obtained was dried, molded, crushed,<br>
fractionated by sieves and calcined in the same manner as in the production of<br>

evaporated to dryness with stirring under heating. The solid material thus<br>
obtained was dried, molded, crushed, fractionated by sieves and calcined in the<br>
same manner as in the production of catalyst H of Reference Example 8 to<br><br>
obtain catalyst 9. The composition exclusive of oxygen of the catalyst 9 was P1<br>
AS0.2M012 Fe0.05Cu0.2 V0.5 Cs1.2.<br>
[0093]<br>
(Test 9 of the production of methacrylic acid)<br>
By using this catalyst 9, reaction was carried out in the same reaction<br>
condition as that in the test H of the production of methacrylic acid of Reference<br>
Example 8 and obtained the following results. Conversion of methacrolein was<br>
82.7 mol%, selectivity to methacrylic acid was 87.4 mol% and per pass yield of<br>
methacrylic acid was 72.3 mol%, and the catalyst 9 had the same performance<br>
as the catalyst H.<br>
[0094]<br>
Example 10<br>
(Production of catalyst 10)<br>
To 260 parts of pure water, the total amount of the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material obtained in the same manner as in recovery of<br>
molybdenum 9 of Example 9 (54.3 parts as molybdenum), 50 parts of<br>
molybdenum trioxide obtained by calcining ammonium paramolybdate at 550°C<br>
for 3 hours, 1.7 part of vanadium pentoxide, 8.8 parts of 85 mass% phosphoric<br>
acid and 3.6 parts of 60 mass% arsenic acid were added and the resultant<br>
solution was heated and stirred for 5 hours under refluxing. The resultant<br>
solution was cooled to 50oC and a solution obtained by dissolving 13.5 parts of<br>
cesium nitrate in 30 parts of pure water was added, and the mixed liquid thus<br>
obtained was heated to 70°C. Then, 44 parts of 29 mass% aqueous ammonia<br>
was added. The amount of ammonia in the resultant solution was 9.9 moles<br>
per 12 moles of molybdenum. The resultant mixed liquid was stirred at 70°C<br>
for 90 minutes and a solution obtained by dissolving 3.7 parts of copper nitrate<br>
in 13 parts of pure water and a solution obtained by dissolving 1.6 parts of iron<br>
nitrate in 13 parts of pure water were added and the resultant mixed liquid was<br><br>
evaporated to dryness with stirring under heating. The solid material thus<br>
obtained was dried, molded, crushed, fractionated by sieves and calcined in the<br>
same manner as in the production of catalyst H of Reference Example 8 to<br>
obtain catalyst 10. The composition exclusive of oxygen of the catalyst 10 was<br>
P1 AS0.2M012 Fe0.05Cu0.2 V0.5 Cs1.2.<br>
[0095]<br>
(Test 10 of the production of methacrylic acid)<br>
By using this catalyst 10, reaction was carried out in the same reaction<br>
condition as that in the test H of the production of methacrylic acid of Reference<br>
Example 8 and obtained the following results. Conversion of methacrolein was<br>
82.9 mol%, selectivity to methacrylic acid was 87.3 mol% and per pass yield of<br>
methacrylic acid was 72.4 mol%, and the catalyst 10 had the same performance<br>
as the catalyst H.<br>
[0096]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
(Recovery of molybdenum 10)<br>
The same manner as in the recovery of molybdenum 1 of Example 1 was<br>
carried out except that pH of the liquid after adding 45 mass% sodium hydroxide<br>
aqueous solution and stirring was adjusted to 4 by 36 mass% hydrochloric acid<br>
and pH of the liquid after adding magnesium chloride hexahydrate solution and<br>
29 mass% aqueous ammonia was adjusted to 5 by 29 mass% aqueous<br>
ammonia, and thus "recovered molybdenum-containing material 10" was<br>
obtained. The recovered molybdenum-containing material 10 contained 21.4<br>
parts of molybdenum, and 0.6 part of phosphorus. At this time, ratio of<br>
recovery of molybdenum was 38.2 % by mass and the ratio of recovery was<br>
drastically lowered. Removal of phosphorus was insufficient in this method.<br>
Nevertheless, cesium was not detected in the recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material 10.<br><br>
[0097]<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
(Recovery of molybdenum 11)<br>
The same manner as in the recovery of molybdenum 1 of Example 1 was<br>
carried out except that 36 mass% hydrochloric acid was not added after adding<br>
45 mass% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and stirring and 29 mass%<br>
aqueous ammonia was not added after adding magnesium chloride<br>
hexahydrate solution and 29 mass% aqueous ammonia, and thus "recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material 11" was obtained. The recovered<br>
molybdenum-containing material 11 contained 54.3 parts of molybdenum, 1.5<br>
parts of phosphorus and 5.9 parts of cesium. At this time, ratio of recovery of<br>
molybdenum was 96.4 % by mass, however, removal of phosphorus was<br>
insufficient in this method.<br>
