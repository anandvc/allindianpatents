benzothiophene-6-carbonitrile and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof.<br>
An especially preferred compound of formula (I) is<br>
(1S)-1-{2-{(2R)-4-(1,2-Dihydro-5-acenaphthylenyl)-2-<br>
methylpiperazinyl J ethyl} -3,4-dihydro-lH-2-benzopyran-6-<br>
carboxamide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof.<br>
As indicated above, it is, of course, possible to<br>
prepare salts of the compounds of the invention and such<br>
salts are included in the invention. Acid addition<br>
salts are preferably the pharmaceutieally acceptable,<br>
non-toxic addition salts with suitable acids, such as<br>
those with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, nitric, sulphuric or phosphoric acids, or<br>
with organic acids, such as organic carboxylic acids,<br>
for example glycollic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, fumaric,<br>
malic, tartaric, citric, salicyclic, o-acetoxybenzoic.<br>
or organic sulphonic, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonic,<br>
toluene-p-sulphonic, naphthalene-2-sulphonie or<br>
bisethane sulphenic acids. The fumarate is a most<br>
preferred salt.<br>
In addition to the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, other salts are included in the invention. They<br>
may serve as intermediates in the purification of<br>
compounds or in the preparation of compounds or in the<br>
preparation of other, for example pharmaceutieally<br>
acceptable acid addition salts, or are useful for<br>
identification, characterisation or purification.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the<br>
invention can contain one or more asymmetric carbon<br>
atoms which gives rise to isomers. The compounds are<br>
normally prepared as racemie mixtures, but individual<br>
isomers can be isolated by conventional techniques if so<br>
desired. Such racemic mixtures and individual optical<br>
isomers form part of the present invention the<br>
compounds being employed as racemates or in<br>
enantiomerically pure form.<br>

for formula I above, and -W- is -CH2-, -O-, or -S-, with<br>
the proviso's as for formula I above.<br>
Compounds of formula Ia can contain more asymmetric<br>
carbons. For example when the R11 and R12 groups are<br>
different, this gives rise to further isomers, such as<br>
compounds of formula (Ib) and (Ic) :<br>
wherein all of the values -X-Y-, R1 to R12, n and p<br>
are as defined in formula (I) above, and -W- is -CH2-, -<br>
O- or -S-, with the proviso's therein. Said isomers are<br>
also an aspect of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (Ib) above, wherein the group<br>
r11 takes priority over R12 according to the Cahn-<br>
Ingold-Prelog sequence rules as described in J. March,<br>
Fourth Edition, Chapter 4, page 109, and wherein<br>
therefore the configuration of the carbon to which R11<br>
and R12 are attached is R, are preferred. Particularly<br>
preferred compounds are those of formula (Ib) wherein<br>
R9, R10 and R12 are hydrogen and R11 is C1-6 alkyl.<br>
In the same way, when the R9 and R10 groups are<br>
different in compounds of formula Ia, this also gives<br>
rise to isomers, such as compounds of formula (Id) and<br>
(Ie):<br>
wherein all of the values -X-Y-,R1 to R12, n and p<br>
have the values defined for formula I above, and -W- is<br>
-CH2-, -O-, or -S- with the proviso's as for formula I.<br>
Said isomers are also an aspect of the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (Id) above, wherein the<br>
group R9 takes priority over R10 according to the Cahn-<br>
Ingold-Prelog sequence rules as described in J. March,<br>
Fourth Edition, Chapter 4, page 109, and wherein<br>
therefore the configuration of the carbon to which r9<br>
and R10 are attached is R, are preferred. Particularly<br>
preferred compounds are those of formula (Id) wherein R9<br>
is C1-6 alkyl and R10, R11 and R12 are hydrogen.<br>
The preferred stereochemistry detailed above<br>
applies also the compounds of the present invention of<br>
formulae (I'), (I"). (I'') and (Iiv) .<br>
The compounds of the invention can be produced by<br>
reacting a compound having the formula:<br>
where the substituents have the values defined for<br>
formula (I) above.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the<br>
presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, in an<br>
organic solvent such as a polar aprotic solvent, for<br>
example, acetonitrile, at a temperature of from 20°C to<br>
100°C. Examples of suitable leaving groups are mesylate,<br>
tosylate, triflate, chloride, bromide and iodide,<br>
especially bromide and iodide.<br>

example, be prepared from the corresponding alcohols of<br>
the formula:<br>
using standard methods known in the literature such as<br>
the ones shown in March, Advanced Organic Chemistry,<br>

36(15), 2242 and J. Med. Chem, 36(9) 1194.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) wherein R10 is -CH2-Or20<br>
and X-Y- is can be prepared as described in the<br>
synthetic scheme below:<br>
In the above scheme, the nitrogen atoms are<br>
protected with a suitable protecting group such as N-<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) or any other suitable group<br>
using methods described in Greene and Wuts, Protecting<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd. Ed., John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, followed by reduction of the acid moiety to the<br>
alcohol, alkylation of said alcohol and deprotection of<br>
the nitrogen atoms.<br>
The unprotected piperidine is then reacted with a<br>
compound of formula Z-Liii in the presence of a palladium<br>
catalyst such as palladium acetate, BINAP ((R)-2,2'-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl) and a base such<br>
as Caesium carbonate.<br>
The nitrogen groups can for example be protected<br>
with a BOC group using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide in an<br>
organic solvent such as ethanol.<br>
The reduction is preferably carried out in the<br>
presence of a reducing agent such as borane dimethyl<br>
sulfide in a organic solvent such as THF at a<br>
temperature ranging from 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The alkylation reaction is preferably carried out<br>
in an organic solvent such as DMF, in the presence of a<br>
base such as sodium hydride and an alkylating agent such<br>
as iodomethane (for compounds where r20 is methyl).<br>
Compounds of formula (V) wherein R7 and R8 are<br>
hydrogen can, for example, be prepared from the<br>
appropriate esters of the formula:<br>
where R is C1-6 alkyl. Such esters can be reduced in the<br>
presence of a reducing agent such as lithium borohydride<br>
or lithium aluminium hydride in a suitable organic<br>
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>
Compounds of formula (V) wherein R1 is -CONR13R14<br>
can be prepared from the appropriate halo-substituted<br>
alcohols of the formula:<br>
where R' is a halo group, such as chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>
Such alcohols are prepared using the same conditions as<br>
shown above. Then the alcohol is protected using a<br>
suitable protecting group as shown in Greene and Wuts,<br>
Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd. Ed., John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons. Preferred protecting groups are silyloxy<br>
protecting groups such as for example<br>
tertbutyldimethylsilyl group.<br>
The halogen is then converted to the corresponding<br>
carboxamido group {-C0NR13r14)/ via formation of the<br>
corresponding carboxy group and then condensation with<br>
the appropriate amine of formula HNR13R14 . The carboxy<br>
group is formed by reaction of the intermediate<br>
organolithium reagent with carbon dioxide in a suitable<br>
organic solvent such as THF. The subsequent condensation<br>
reaction with the appropriate amine of formula HNr13r14<br>
is preferably carried out in the presence of a coupling<br>
reagent such as carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in a suitable<br>
solvent such as dioxan.<br>
Similarly the halogen can be converted in one step<br>
to the corresponding carboxamido group by reaction of<br>
the organolithium reagent described above with<br>
trimethylsilyl isocyanate.<br>
Alternatively the halogen can be converted to the<br>
corresponding carboxamido group by initial reaction with<br>
an inorganic cyanide, such as zinc cyanide, in the<br>
presence of a palladium catalyst, such as<br>
tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium, and a phosphine<br>
ligand, such as tri-tert-butylphosphine. The reaction is<br>
carried out in a suitable solvent such as dioxan,<br>
usually at reflux. The resultant nitrile is then<br>
hydrolysed to the carboxamide under basic conditions,<br>
such as hydrogen peroxide with potassium carbonate. The<br>
reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent such as<br>
DMSO in methanol. In this conversion there is no<br>
necessity to protect the alcohol function.<br>
Then the alcohols are deprotected using standard<br>
methods known in the literature, such as Greene and<br>
Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd. Ed.,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons.<br>
Compounds of the formula (VI) wherein -<br>
and r5 and R6 are hydrogen can be prepared from the<br>
appropriate ketones of formula (VII) as shown in Scheme<br>
1 below.<br>
Such ketones react with activated ylides such as<br>
for example a phosphonate of the formula<br>
(RiiO)2P(O)CH2CO2Riii, wherein R11 and Riii are each<br>
C1-6 alkyl, in the presence of a base such as sodium<br>
hydride in a suitable solvent such as for example THF to<br>
form the corresponding unsaturated ester (VIII) . The<br>
alkene is reduced for example via hydrogenation in the<br>
presence of a catalyst such as Pd on charcoal in a<br>
suitable solvent such as ethanol or methanol.<br>
Unsaturated esters of formula (IX) can be prepared<br>
via isomerisation of the corresponding unsaturated ester<br>
of formula (VIII) as shown in scheme 1 above. This<br>
reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable<br>
base such as sodium methanide in a suitable solvent such<br>
as THF.<br>
Compounds of the formula (VI) wherein ¦ -<br>
can be prepared as shown in scheme 2 from the<br>
appropriate lactones of formula (X).<br>
Such lactones are converted to the corresponding<br>
hemiacetals via reduction of the lactone using a<br>
reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminium hydride<br>
(DIBAL) in the presence of a suitable solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane, followed by the protection of the<br>
intermediate hemiacetal with a suitable protecting group<br>
such as acetate. The protected hemiacetal is reacted<br>
with an appropriate organozincate derived from the<br>
corresponding haloacetal of formula Li-CH2-CO2R wherein<br>
Li is a halogen group such as bromo or iodo and R has<br>
the value defined above, in the presence of a Lewis acid<br>
such as trimethylsilyltriflate to form esters of the<br>
formula (VI)ii.<br>
Alternatively the hemiacetal is reacted directly<br>
with an activated ylid such as for example a phosphonate<br>
of the formula (RiiO)2P(O)CH2CO2Riii, wherein Rii and Riii<br>
are each C1-6 alkyl, in the presence of a base such as<br>
caesium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as for<br>
example THF, to form the corresponding ester (VI)11.<br>
Such esters can be converted to the corresponding<br>
alcohols using the method mentioned above. Alternatively<br>
they can be hydrolysed in acidic conditions to the acid,<br>
followed by formation of the mixed anhydride and final<br>
reduction of such a mixed anhydride to the corresponding<br>
alcohol of formula (V)ii.<br>
Alternatively compounds above wherein n is 2 can be<br>
synthesised via standard acid catalysed cyclisation of<br>
the corresponding phenyl alcohol of formula (XII) with<br>
an appropriate aldehyde of the formula CHO-CH2-COOR or<br>
its corresponding acetal of the formula<br>
(RVO)2CH-CH2-COOR , wherein Riv and RV are each<br>
independently a C1-C6 alkyl group, in the presence of a<br>
Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride in a suitable<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane, see Scheme 3 below.<br>
Compounds of the formula (V) wherein —w—V— is --CH2—N--<br>
can be prepared as shown in scheme 4 from the<br>
appropriate quinolines of formula (XIII).<br>
Such quinolines are converted to the corresponding<br>
1,2,3,4 tetrahydroquinolines by reduction, for example<br>
by hydrogenation in the presence of ammonium formate anc<br>
a suitable catalyst such as Palladium on charcoal in a<br>
suitable solvent such as methanol. The<br>
tetrahydroquinoline is then alkylated with allyl halide<br>
for example allyl bromide in the presence of a suitable<br>
base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such<br>
as dimethylformamide (DMF) . The double bond of the ally]<br>
group is then cleaved for example via ozonolysis. The<br>
intermediate ozonide formed is reduced with a suitable<br>
reducing agent such as sodium borohydride to give the<br>
corresponding alcohol. Alternatively such a double bond<br>
can be cleaved for example with osmium tetroxide and<br>
sodium periodate in the presence of a suitable reducing<br>
agent such as sodium borohydride.<br>
Compounds of the formula (V) wherein<br>
can be prepared as shown in scheme 5 from the<br>
appropriate 2-oxo-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline of formula<br>
(XVI) .<br>
Scheme 5<br>
Such 2-oxo-l,2, 3,4-tetrahydroquinolines can be<br>
alkylated with an allyl halide for example allyl bromide<br>
in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium<br>
hydride in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide<br>
(DMF) . The allyl group can be converted to the<br>
corresponding alcohol using the method shown above.<br>
Compounds of the invention can also be synthesised<br>
via reaction of the corresponding amine of the formula<br>
(XIX) with a compound of the formula Z-L wherein L<br>
is a leaving group such as triflate or a halide such as<br>
bromide or iodide.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
Such reactions are usually carried out in the<br>
presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium<br>
acetate and a base such as potassium tertbutoxide.<br>
Some intermediates of the general formula Z-Liii<br>
wherein L is a halogen group such as bromo are<br>
commercially available. Alternatively, they can be<br>
synthesised from known literature routes, such as by<br>
brominating the corresponding aromatic group with NBS.<br>
Intermediates wherein L is a triflate can be prepared<br>
using methods known in the art such as from the<br>
corresponding ketones in the presence of triflic<br>
anhydride. Such intermediates are illustrated in scheme<br>
7 for compound wherein Z is (i) and (xii) , but it will<br>
be appreciated that such method can be used for any<br>
values of Z. It will also be appreciated that for<br>
compounds wherein Z is (xxi) to (xxv) the linker -T-<br>
might have to be protected during any of these<br>
processes, especially for compounds wherein -T- is -<br>
C(O)- or -CH=CH-.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein H1 is<br>
synthesised from the corresponding amide intermediates<br>
of formula (V)v wherein the alcohol moiety is protected<br>
with an appropriate alcohol protecting group P, such as<br>
those shown in Greene and Wuts, Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, 3rd. Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons.<br>
Such intermediates are cyclised via reaction with<br>
dimethylformamide dimethylacetal in a suitable solvent<br>
such as toluene, followed by reaction with the<br>
corresponding hydrazine of the formula R13-NH-NH2 in a<br>
suitable solvent such as for example methanol. Then the<br>
alcohols are deprotected using methods known in the art<br>
such as those shown in Greene and Wuts, Protecting<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd. Ed., John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons.<br>
Scheme 8<br>
As described above the compounds of the invention<br>
can have an asymmetric centre, said compounds, for<br>
example compounds of formula Ia, can be prepared in a<br>

slices were incubated for 11 minutes in buffer and then<br>
transferred for 4 minutes to a second tube containing<br>
buffer. Following incubation they were again<br>
transferred, for a further 4 minutes, to a buffer in<br>
which NaCl had been substituted, on an equimolar basis,<br>
to give a KC1 concentration of 30 mM (release sample) .<br>
The tritium in the tissue samples and in the<br>
buffers from the three incubation periods was estimated<br>
by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Test compound was<br>
present throughout the three incubation periods. The<br>
compounds of the invention enhanced release of 5-HT.<br>
The compounds of the invention are serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors, and possess excellent activity as,<br>
for example, in the test described by Carroll et al. ,<br>
J. Med. Chem. (1993), 36, 2886-2890, in which the<br>
intrinsic activity of the compound to competitively<br>
inhibit the binding of selective serotonin reuptake<br>
inhibitors to the serotonin transporter is measured.<br>
These results were also confirmed by in vivo tests in<br>
which the effect of the compound on a behavioural<br>
syndrome in mice dosed with 5-HTP and a monoamine<br>
oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as pargyline, is measured,<br>
see Christensen, A. V., et al. , Eur. J. Pharmacol. 41,<br>
153-162 (1977).<br>
In view of the selective affinity of the compounds<br>
of the invention for the serotonin receptors, they are<br>
indicated for use in treating a variety of conditions<br>
associated with serotonin dysfunction in mammals<br>
including disorders of the central nervous system such<br>
as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, obesity,<br>
eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia,<br>
alcoholism, pain, hypertension, ageing, memory loss,<br>
sexual dysfunction, psychotic disorders, schizophrenia,<br>
gastrointestinal disorders, headache, cardiovascular<br>
disorders, smoking cessation, epilepsy, drug abuse and<br>
addiction, emesis, Alzheimer's disease and sleep<br>
disorders. The compounds of the invention are<br>
principally intended for the treatment of depression or<br>
anxiety, or disorders with depressive or anxiety<br>
symptoms.<br>
Accordingly the present invention includes the use<br>
of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of a disorder associated<br>
with serotonin dysfunction in mammals, including any of<br>
the disorders mentioned above.<br>
The compounds of the invention are effective over a<br>
wide dosage range, the actual dose administered being<br>
dependent on such factors as the particular compound<br>
being used, the condition being treated and the type and<br>
size of animal being treated. However, the dosage<br>
required will normally fall within the range of 0.001 to<br>
20, such as 0.01 to 20 mg/kg per day, for example in the<br>
treatment of adult humans, dosages of from 0.5 to 100 or<br>
200 mg per day may be used.<br>
The compounds of the invention will normally be<br>
administered orally or by injection and, for this<br>
purpose, the compounds will usually be utilised in the<br>
form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions<br>
are prepared in a manner well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active<br>
compound.<br>
Accordingly the invention includes a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising as active ingredient a compound<br>
of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or carrier. In making the compositions of the<br>
invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed<br>
with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed<br>
within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule,<br>
sachet, paper or other container. More than one active<br>
ingredient or excipient may, of course, be employed.<br>
The excipient may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid<br>
material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium<br>
for the active ingredient. Some examples of suitable<br>
excipients are lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,<br>
mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate,<br>
alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, syrup, methyl cellulose,<br>
methyl- and propyl-hydroxybenzoate, talc, magnesium<br>
stearate or oil. The compositions of the invention may,<br>
if desired, be formulated so as to provide quick,<br>
sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient<br>
after administration to the patient.<br>
Depending on the route of administration, the<br>
foregoing compositions may be formulated as tablets,<br>
capsules or suspensions for oral use and injection<br>
solutions or suspensions for parenteral use or as<br>
suppositories. Preferably the compositions are<br>
formulated in a dosage unit form, each dosage containing<br>
from 0.5 to 100 mg, more usually 1 to 100 mg, of the<br>
active ingredient.<br>
