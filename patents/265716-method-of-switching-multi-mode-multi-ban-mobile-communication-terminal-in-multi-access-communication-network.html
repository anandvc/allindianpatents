The present invention is described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings below.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example of the regions of a multi-access communication network according to the present invention. With reference to FIG. 1, the structure of the multi-access-enabled communication network, to which the method according to the present invention is applied, is described below.<br>
The multi-access communication network according to the embodiment of the present invention may be divided into a first wireless network (mobile communication network), a second wireless network (portable Internet) and .a third wireless network (WLAN that is a public wireless network) for convenience's sake.<br>
The above-described first to third wireless communication networks have different data transmission rates. In general, the mobile communication' network,.that is, the first wireless network, has an effective transmission rate of about 100 Kbps, the portable Internet, that is, the second wireless network, has an effective transmission rate of about 300 Kbps, and the WLAN, that is, the third wireless network, has an effective<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
transmission rate of about 500 Kbps. That is, the order of the transmission rates may be expressed as WLAN &gt; portable Internet &gt; mobile communication network.<br>
As a result, the WLAN is chiefly deployed in areas that are identified as hot spots and have heavy use of communication, and generally have the narrowest coverage.<br>
The above-described first to third wireless networks have coverages according to the order of mobile communication network (A) &gt; portable Internet (B) &gt; WLAN (C). In this case, the mobile communication network includes a CDMA-2000 network, that is, a synchronous communication network, and a WCDMA network, that is, an asynchronous communication network, though not indicated particularly, and the handoff between the synchronous mobile communication network and the asynchronous mobile communication network follows a conventional scheme simply using signal intensity or the method of the present invention that will be described below.<br>
In the above-described multi-access communication network, the mobile communication terminal can perform handoff in the cases in which it is located in the region of the WLAN, the region of the portable Internet and the region of the mobile communication network, which may be classified as described below.<br>
1-1) WLAN --&gt; WLAN 1-2) WLAN --&gt; portable Internet 1-3) WLAN —&gt; mobile communication network 2-1) portable Internet --&gt; WLAN 2-2) portable Internet --&gt; portable Internet 2-3) portable Internet --&gt; mobile communication network 3-1) mobile communication network —&gt; WLAN 3-2) mobile communication network- -&gt; portable Internet<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
3-3) mobile communication network --&gt; mobile communication network<br>
In each of the above-described cases, when the mobile communication terminal is located in the region of a specific communication network, handoff is performed in such a way that the link quality of the current communication network is compared with that of an adjacent communication network and a handoff to the communication network having superior link quality (communication network having a higher transmission rate) is performed.<br>
When a transmission rate based on the link quality of the current communication network is lower than a preset reference value in the case where there is not a communication network having link quality superior to that of the current communication network, handoff to an upper communication network, that is, a communication network having a coverage wider than that of the current communication network, is performed.<br>
However, even though a transmission rate based on the link quality of the current communication network is lower than a preset reference value, a current communication state is maintained if the transmission rate is higher than an effective transmission rate that is measured based on a signal received from the adjacent communication network.<br>
For example, if the adjacent wireless network is the portable Internet and the link quality thereof is about 300 Kbps when the mobile communication terminal is located in the region of a WLAN having a transmission rate of 500 Kbps and the transmission rate based on'the link quality of the current WLAN is 200 Kbps, which is lower than the preset reference value (for example, about 300 Kbps), the mobile communication terminal performs handoff from the region of the WLAN to the region of the portable Internet.<br>
However, if the adjacent wireless network is the mobile communication network when the transmission rate based on the link quality of the current WLAN is. 200 Kbps,<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
which is lower than the preset reference value (for example, 300 Kbps), the link quality of the mobile communication network is about 100 Kbps, so that the mobile communication terminal maintains current WLAN communication.<br>
In order to control the handoff of the mobile communication terminal according to the above-described method, the handoff is performed by measuring the link quality of communication networks, determining an available data transmission rate based on the link quality, and comparing the available data transmission rate with the preset reference value.<br>
The reference value is set differently according to the case in order to perform efficient handoff. In the present embodiment, an effective transmission rate is calculated using a Packet Error Rate (PER) as a parameter for determining the link quality of the communication networks.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the construction of a multi-band multi-mode mobile communication terminal according to the present invention.<br>
The mobile communication terminal according to the present invention, which is shown in FIG. 2, is a multi-band multi-mode mobile communication terminal capable of accessing all of the above described first to third communication networks.<br>
The platform of the mobile communication terminal 100 according to the present invention includes a mobile communication modem 110 for performing communication with the mobile communication network, a mobile communication network module 140 for controlling mobile communication network communication, a portable Internet modem<br>
121	for performing communication with the portable Internet, a portable Internet module<br>

performing communication with the WLAN that is a public wireless network, and a<br>
WLAN module 132 for controlling WLAN communication.<br>

Each of the mobile communication network module 140, the portable Internet module 122 and the WLAN module 132 calculates an effective transmission rate by detecting the signal of a corresponding communication network through a corresponding modem and using the PER(Packet Error Rate) as a parameter for determining the link quality of the communication network signal, and transmits the transmission rate to the main processor 150.<br>
Accordingly, the main processor 150 receives data transmitted from the mobile communication module 140, the portable Internet module 122 and the WLAN module 132, determines whether to perform handoff according to the above-described method, and performs the handoff to a communication network satisfying a preset handoff condition through a corresponding module and modem when the handoff condition is satisfied.<br>
For this purpose, in each of the above-described cases, when the mobile communication terminal 100 is located in the region of a specific communication network, the main processor 150 compares the link quality of the current communication network with that of an adjacent communication network and performs handoff to the communication network having superior link quality (communication network having a high transmission rate), in accordance with the criteria of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, if a transmission rate based on the link quality of the current communication network is lower than the preset reference value when there is no communication network having link quality superior to that of the current communication network, handoff to an upper communication network, that is, a communication network having coverage wider than that of the current communication network, is performed.<br>
However, if a transmission rate based on the link quality of the current communication network is higher than an effective transmission rate based on a signal received from an adjacent communication network even through the transmission rate<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
based on the link quality is lower than the preset reference value, a current communication state is maintained.<br>
The above-described method according to the present invention is described through handoff processes in individual communication networks in detail below.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a handoff process in the region of the WLAN according to the present invention, which corresponds to the above-described cases 1-1), 1-2) and 1-3).<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the mobile communication terminal 100 is located in the region of the WLAN at step S10 and measures the signal from the WLAN at step S20. The mobile communication terminal 100 calculates an effective transmission rate using a parameter for determining the link quality of the measured signal from the WLAN, for example, a PER at step S30.<br>
The mobile communication terminal 100 determines whether the calculated link quality is lower than a first reference value (for example, 500 Kbps) at step S40.<br>
In this case, if it is determined that the PER is not lower than the first reference value at step S40, the PER is equal to or higher than the first reference value, so that the mobile communication terminal 100 maintains current WLAN communication.<br>
In contrast, if it is determined that the link quality is lower than the first reference value at step S40, the mobile communication terminal 100 measures a signal from the portable Internet at step S50. Thereafter, at step S60, it is determined whether the signal from the portable Internet has been measured at step S50.<br>
If, at step S60, it is determined that the signal from the portable Internet has not been measured, it is determined whether the link quality of the current WLAN signal is higher than a second reference value (for example, about 100 Kbps) that is set below the first reference value at step S61.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
If, at step S61, the link quality of the current WLAN signal is higher than the second reference value, the current portable Internet signal is not measured, and it is determined that link quality of the WLAN is superior to that using of mobile communication network, so that the mobile communication terminal 100 maintains communication using the current WLAN at step S62.<br>
In contrast, if, at step S61, it is determined that the link quality of the current WLAN signal is not higher than the second reference value, the mobile communication modem 110 is activated at step S63, and handoff to the mobile communication network is-performed at step S64. In this case, the mobile communication terminal 100 may perform handoff to a synchronous communication network or an asynchronous communication network, in which case the mode of the mobile communication terminal is switched and handoff is performed with priority being given to the asynchronous communication depending on signal intensity.<br>
In the meantime, if, at step S60, it is determined that the signal from the portable Internet has been measured, the mobile communication terminal 100 calculates the link quality of the portable Internet signal at step S70. Furthermore, it is determined whether the calculated link quality of the portable Internet signal is higher than the preset second reference value at step S80.<br>
If the link quality of the portable Internet signal is higher than the second reference value at step S80, the mobile communication terminal 100 activates the portable Internet modem 121 at step S90, and the mode is switched to the portable Internet and handoff is performed at step SI 00.<br>
In contrast, if the link quality of the portable Internet signal is not higher than the second reference value at step S80, the mobile communication terminal 100 determines whether the link quality of the WLAN is higher than the second reference value at step<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
S61. If, at step S61, the link quality of the WLAN is higher than the second reference value, current WLAN communication is maintained at step S62.<br>
In contrast, if, at step S61, it is determined that the link quality of the WLAN is not higher than the second reference value, the mobile communication terminal 100 activates the mobile communication modem 110 at step S63, and the mode is switched to the mobile communication network and handoff is performed at step S64. In this case, the mobile communication terminal 100 may perform handoff to a synchronous communication network or an asynchronous communication network, in which case the mode is switched for handoff and the handoff is performed with priority being given to the asynchronous communication depending on signal intensity.<br>
FIG, 4 is a flowchart illustrating a handoff process in the region of the portable Internet according to the present invention, which corresponds to the above-described cases 2-1), 2-2) and 2-3).<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the mobile communication terminal 100 is located in the region of the portable Internet at step SI 10 and measures the signal from the WLAN at step S120. Furthermore, it is determined whether the signal from the WLAN has been measured at step SI30.<br>
If, at step S130, it is determined that the signal from the WLAN has been measured, an effective transmission rate is calculated using a parameter for determining the link quality of the measured WLAN signal, for example, a PER, at step SI 40.<br>
The mobile communication terminal 100 determines whether the calculated link quality is higher than a preset first reference value (for example, 500 Kbps) at step SI50. In this case, if the link quality is higher than the first reference value at step SI50, the mobile communication terminal 100 activates the WLAN modem at step SI60, and the mode is switched to WLAN communication and handoff is performed at step S170.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
Meanwhile, if it is determined that the link quality is not higher than the first reference value at step SI50 or it is determined that the signal from, the WLAN has not been measured at step S130, the mobile communication terminal 100 measures a signal from the portable Internet at step S131. Thereafter, the link quality of the signal from the portable Internet is calculated at step S132. Thereafter, it is determined whether the calculated link quality of the portable Internet is lower than the first reference value and higher than a second reference value that is set below the first reference value at step SI33.<br>
If, at step SI 33, it is determined that the link quality of the portable Internet signal is lower than the first reference value and higher than the second reference value, the mobile communication terminal 100 maintains the current portable Internet communication.<br>
Meanwhile, if it is determined that the link quality of the portable Internet signal deviates from the range from the first reference value to the second reference value at step SI33, it is determined whether the link quality of the WLAN is higher than the second reference value at step SI34.<br>
If it is determined that the link quality of the WLAN is higher than the second reference value at step SI34, the WLAN modem 131 is activated at step SI60 and handoff to the WLAN is performed at step S170.<br>
In contrast, if the link quality of the WLAN is not higher than the second reference value at step SI34, it is determined that the link quality using the mobile communication network is superior, the mobile communication modem 110 is activated at step S1 35, and the mode is switched to the mobile communication network and handoff is then performed at step S136. In this case, the mobile communication terminal 100 may perform handoff to a synchronous communication network or an asynchronous communication network, in which case the mode is switched for handoff and the handoff is<br>

performed with priority being given to the asynchronous communication depending on signal intensity.<br>
FIG. 5 is a-flowchart illustrating a handoff process in the region of the mobile communication network according to the present invention, which corresponds to the above-described cases 3-1), 3-2) and 3-3).<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the mobile communication terminal 100 is located in the region of the mobile communication network at step S210 and measures the signal from the WLAN at step S220. An effective transmission rate is calculated using a parameter for determining the link quality of the WLAN signal measured at step S220, for example, a PER, at step S230.<br>
The mobile communication terminal 100 determines whether the link quality calculated at step S230 is higher than the preset first reference value (for example, 500 Kbps) at step S240. In this case, if the link quality is higher than the first reference value at step S240, the mobile communication terminal 100 activates the WLAN modem at step S262, and the mode is switched to WLAN communication and handoff is performed at step S263.<br>
Meanwhile, if it is determined that the link quality is not higher than the first reference value at step S240, the mobile communication terminal 100 measures a signal from the portable Internet at step S250. Thereafter, it is determined whether a signal from the portable Internet has been measured at step S260.<br>
If it is detected that the signal from the portablejnternet has been measured at step S260, the mobile communication terminal 100 calculates the link quality of the portable Internet at step S270. Thereafter, it is determined whether the calculated link quality is higher than a preset second reference value that is set below the first reference value at step S280.<br>

WO 2005/071866	PCT/KR2005/000212<br>
If it is determined that the link quality of the portable Internet is higher than the second reference value at step S280, the mobile communication terminal 100 activates the portable Internet modem 121 at step S290, and the mode is switched to the portable Internet and handoff is performed at step S300.<br>
In contrast, if it is deteraiined that the link quality of the portable Internet is not higher than the second reference value at step S280 or it is determined that the signal from the portable Internet has not been measured at step S260, it is determined whether the link quality of the WLAN is higher than the second reference value at step S261.<br>
If it is determined that the link quality of the WLAN is not higher than the second reference value at step S261, the mobile communication terminal 100 maintains current mobile communication network communication at step S264.<br>
In contrast, if it is determined that the link quality of the WLAN is higher than the second reference value at step S261, the WLAN modem 131 is activated at step S262, and the mode is switched to the WLAN and handoff is performed at step S263.<br>
