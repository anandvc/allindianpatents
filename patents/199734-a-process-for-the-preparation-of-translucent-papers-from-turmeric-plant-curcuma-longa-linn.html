				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of translucent papers from Turmeric plant Curcuma longa Linn and translucent papers prepared thereby. Paper which permits the partial transmission of light but through which objects can be distinguished visually only when the paper is in direct contact with them is termed as Translucent paper (IS : 4661-1968) .<br>
Translucent papers are categorised mainly into two types. One type is unbleached translucent papers and another is bleached translucent papers. "Unbleached translucent papers include mostly the greaseproof papers, butter papers, vegetable parchment and few varieties of packaging papers whereas bleached translucent papers include tracing papers, glassine papers and parchment papers.<br>
The translucent papers relating to the present invention are Greaseproof papers and Butter papers in case of unbleached variety and Tracing papers in case of bleached variety.<br>
Greaseproof papers are free from mechanical pulp, having a high resistance to penetration of grease (IS : 6622-1972) .'<br>
Butter papers are a form of grease resistant paper usually used for wrapping, butter, lard and other greasy materials (IS ; 4661-1968) .<br>
The main usage of the types of papers mentioned above is in the packaging   industry  for packaging of various products where<br>
resistance to grease or fat is of specific importance and release papers in case of stickers etc. Natural Tracing paper is defined as-paper which has been made transslucent by mechanical or simi-lar means during the process of manufacture and rendered suitable for use with ink and/or pencil (IS : 8431 - 1977) . Paper should be sufficiently transparent to allow a design to be traced through and reproduced and intended for this purpose. (IS:4661-1968) . Tracing papers are used in tracing of drawings, development of original drawings and other purposes in the field of drawing and designing.<br>
Details of prior art of making translucent papers from turmeric plant are not availabe. However in the conventional methods translucent papers are manufactured mainly from wood pulp using sulphate process.<br>
The drawbacks connected to the hitherto known processes are given below.<br>
In the conventional process the principal raw material for the manufacture of translucent papers is wood. The process requires long beating time and consequently higher power consumption resulting in high cost of production.<br>
The main objective of the present inventiion is to provide a process for the preparation of translucent paper from turmeric plant and translucent papers prepared thereby which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
The present invention provides a cooking process for the preparation of pulp from turmeric plant which is simple and economic at the same time produces good quality pulp with a higher yield. Moreover, the bleach consumption is comparatively less than that of wood pulp to obtain a similar brightness.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to utilize an eco-friendly waste to produce translucent papers of high commercial value.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to adopt a process for preparation of pulp which requires lesser beating time to get desirable freeness for greaseproof paper, saving higher power consumption and the pulp is suitable for use in high speed machines without affecting the required strength properties of the finished product.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of translucent papers from turmeric plant, which comprises digesting the aerial part of the turmeric plant ( Curcuma longa Linn) with alkali hydroxide such as herein described, in water for a period in the range of 2 to 2 V2 hour, at a temperature ranging 85 °- 95°C , wherein ratio of plant parts and water varies in the range of 1 : 5 to 1.6 , washing the above cooked material with water till it is free from alkali hydroxide, slushing in a hydropulper for a<br>
period in the range of 15 to 30 minutes, feeding to a refiner and refining for a period of 30 to 40 minutes till the pulp attains a freeness of 90 to 95 SR, converting the pulp so obtained to paper hand sheets of basis weight of sheet being 45 + 2 gm per square meter, in a standard paper sheet forming machine, drying and calendaring, to get the desired translusant paper.<br>
The ratio of plant part and water used may be in the range of 1:5 to 1:6.<br>
The ratio of plant part and alkali metal hydroxide and alkali metal hydroxide used may be in the range of 100:3 to 100:6.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the raw material selected for the manufacture of translucent paper is a bio waste, as only rhizomes of turmeric plant is commercially used.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the required processing time for the manufacture of translucent paper from turmeric plant is less than the papers manufactured conventionally from wood pulp.<br>
In yet, another embodiment of the present invention reduction in processing cost, adoption eco-friendly process for the manufacture of translucent paper and a process suitable for use in conventional paper making machine.<br>
Accordingly  the present inevention provides a transtucent  paper prepared by the process as described above<br>
Unbleached greaseproof paper :<br>
The aerial parts of the turmeric plant were cut and chipped to the chip size in the range of 10-12 cm in length. The cut chips were washed to remove the dirt particles and put in a digester. The amount of water added to the digester is in 1:5 wt. ratio. The required quantity of sodium hydroxide @ 7 wt. percentage on the oven dry wt ofthe turmeric chips was added and digested the ch.ips for 2 hours at boiling temperature. The cooked material was then removed from the digester and washed with fresh water till the material was free from alkali. The cooked material was then slushed in a disintegrator and then fed to a refiner. The refining is continued till the freeness (rate of drainage) of pulp remianed in the range of 90-95 SR. Handsheets of basis weight 45 1 2 gm per square meter were made in a standard sheet forming machine. The sheets were later dried and calendered and physical properties like Blister test, Oil transudation test, Bursting strength, Tensile strength, Tearing strength, Double fold and the like were tested adopting standard TAPPI procedures.<br><br>
Bleached Tracing Paper<br>
The petiole chips of turmeric plants were washed and put in an electrically heated stainless steel rotary digester. The wt. ratio of chips (oven dry basis) to water was maintained at 1:5. The wt. percentage of sodium hydroxide on oven dry wt. of the chips was 6 and the required quantity of the same was added by dissolving in water. The cooking temperature was maintained in the range of 85 to 95 C and time in the range of 2-2 1/2 hrs. The cooked material was discharged from the digester and washed. The material was then slushed in a disintegrator and the excess water was separated. The unbleached pulp was chlorinated by passing chlorine gas till -he pulp is free from brown colour. The pulp was then washed with fresh water and treated with a solution of sodium hydroxide @ 1% on the oven dry weight of the pulp and kept for 30 min. The pulp was washed again with fresh water till it was free from alkali. The pulp was then trated with a solutiion of hypochlorite at room temperature and kept for 30 minutes. After this period the pulp was washed till the pulp was free from hypochlorite.<br>
The bleached pulp was then put in a refiner and refining continued till the pulp attained a freeness of 80 to 85 SR. Handsheets of basis wt. 90 i 2 gm per sq. meter were madein a standard sheet making machine dried and calendered with high nip pressure. The sheets were tested for physical strength properties, transparency and ink receptivity as well as erassability of pencil marks and the like.<br>
The novelties of the proces of the present inventiion are given below .<br>
I. A non-conventional type of raw material i.e. the aerial part of the plant (curcuma longa Linn) (Turmeric) is used for manufacturing  translucent papers.<br>
2 . The processing time for manufacturing translucent paper from turmeric plant is less in comparison to manufacutre similar quality paper from wood pulp.<br>
3. The process adopted for the present inventiion is eco-friend-ly and provided usage of a bio-waste which was previously not used for similar purpose.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present inventiion and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present inventiion.<br>
Example  1<br>
5000 gms of green petiole chips (chip size 10-12 cm long) of turmeric plant were taken and found out the moisture content as 93%. The chips were washed and put in a cubical open vessel with lid 21 gms of commercial grade sodium hydroxide dissolved in 250 ml of water was added to it. 2100 ml of extra water was added to maintain the material to water ratio 1:6 and the level was marked. The cooking was continued for 2 hrs after reaching the initial boiling. After that period the materail was discharged on<br>
a vessel having perforated bottom and washed with water till the material was free from alkali. The material was then fed to a disintegrator at 3% consistency and disintegrated run for 15 minutes to make uniform slurry free from lumps. The slurry was then fed to a refiner and refining continued for 40 minutes till the pulp attained a freeness of 95 SR. Hand sheets of basis weight 45 @ gm per square metre were made in a standard laboratory sheet forming machine and allowed to air dry. The dried sheets were then calendered in a two roll calendering machine. The sheets were then tested for physical strength properties.<br>
Example 2 5000 gms of petiole chips as in example I were taken, washed and fed to a stainless steel electrically heated rotar autoclave. 17.5 gms of commercial grade sodium hydroxide dissolved in 250 ml water and 1.5000 litre of water added to it. The temperature was maintained at 85  5 C and time 2 hrs at maximum temperature.<br>
The material after digestion was washed with fresh water till it was free from alkali. The washed pulp was then fed in a disintegrator and disintegrated for 15 minutes till the pulp was free from lums. The disintegrated pulp was put in a vessel and the consistencey was maintained at 2 percent by adding requisite amount of water . Chlorine gas was injected to the pulp through perforated tube for 30 minutes till the pulp becomes completely free from brown colour. The pulp was washed and treated with alkali (Sodium hydroxide @ one wt. percentage) for 30 minutes and washed with fresh water till the pulp was free from alkali. The  washed pulp was treated again with a solution of calcium  hy<br>
pochlorite of solutiion strength 25 gms per litre for 30 minutes at room temperature. At the end of the period the bleached pulp is washed with fresh water till the pulp was free from hypochlorite. The washed pulp was then fed to a disintegrator and disintegrated the pulp for 15 minutes to obtain the pulp free from lumps. The disintegrated pulp was fed to a refiner and refining continued for 45 minutes till the pulp attained a freeness of 90-95 SR. Hand sheets of basis weight 90 @ gms per square meter were made on a standard sheet forming machine and air dried. The sheets were calendered in a two roll calendering machine with high nip pressure. The sheets were then tested for brightness, transparency and other strength properties.<br>
Example 3 5000 gms of petiole chips as in example I were taken and put in a cubical SS vesel with lid. 10.5 gm of commercial grade potassium hydroxide dissolved in 250 ml of water was added to it. 2100 ml of extra water was added to maintain the material to water ratio 1:6 and the level was marked. The cooking was continued for 2 hrs after reaching the initial boiling. After cooking the pulp was discharged on a vessel having perforated bottom and washed with water till the pulp was free from alkali. The pulp was then fed to a disintegrator at 3% consistencey and disintegrated for 15 lminutes to make a uniform slurry free from lumps. The slurry was then fed to a refiner and refining continued for 40 minutes till the pulp attained a freeness of 95 SR. Handsheets of basis weight 45 gm per square meter were made in a standard laboratory sheet   forming  machine and allowed to air dry. The  dry  sheets<br>
were then calendered in a two roll calendering machine at high nip pressure. The sheets were then tested for physical strength properties.<br>
