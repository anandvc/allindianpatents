The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to methods for treating a protein isolate to mask the characteristic taste and odor of the protein isolate and to reduce its water adsorption. The protein isolate can be converted into many different food forms and may be incorporated into a variety of food products to increase their protein content without conferring the taste of the protein isolate onto the food product. This invention also relates to compositions comprising the treated protein isolates wherein the water adsorption ratio of the composition is similar to the water adsorption ratio of the untreated protein isolates.<br>
Bacliground of the Invention<br>
Soy is found in a variety of food forms, e.g., soy drinks, tofu, soy burgers, soy hot-dogs, soy oil, soy butter. In addition, soy protein and isoflavones are linked to a broad band of healthy benefits e.g., cancer prevention, heart protection, menopause relief and bone health, (see e.g.. Energy Times, February 2001).<br>
In October 1999, the FDA approved a health claim that can be used on labels of soy based foods to tout their heart-healthy benefits. The agency reviewed research from 27 studies that showed soy protein's value in lowering levels of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad" cholesterol).<br>
Food marketers can now use the following claim, or a reasonable variation, on their products: "Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving of (name of food) provides (#) grams of soy protein." To qualify for the claim foods must contain per serving;<br>
6.25 grams of soy protein<br>
low fat (less than 3 grams)<br>
low saturated fat (less than 1 gram)<br>
low cholesterol (less than 20 milligrams)<br>
sodium value of less than 480 milligrams for individual foods, less than 720 milligrams if considered a main dish, and less than 960 milligrams if considered a meal.<br><br>
us Patent 4,307,117 relates to a method for stabilizing curciimin against color changes by dispersing the curcumin in an aqueous fihn-forming solution and drying the solution wherein the improvement comprises adding in an amount of an acid to the solution to reduce the pH thereof to below 6. The composition comprises curcumin, an acid, and may also comprise an encapsulant capable of forming a coating around a hydrophobic material in water and are co-dried. The curcumin may be incorporated into dry food mixes.<br>
US Patent 5,104,674 relates to microfragmented fibers of ionic polysaccharide/protein complex in aqueous dispersions suitable for utilization as nutritious bulking, viscosity or texture control agents. The 5,104,674 patent discloses that by appropriate selection of the ionic polysaccharide component and the protein component and the interaction conditions, a wide variety of syneresed ionic polysaccharide/protein complex precipitation may be provided ranging from substantially isotropic gels to fibrous anisotropic products. The 5,104,674 patent also provides various examples of food products comprising the microfi-agments.<br>

Some studies show soy has medical benefits in normotensive postmenopausal women. Soy improves blood pressure and lipids but does not improve vascular function or lipoprotein (a) levels, according to this randomized, double blind study. A "total of 213 women (105 postmenopausal women) received either soy protein concentrate (40g of soy containing 118 mg isoflavones) or a casein placebo for three months. Subjects were evaluated for changes in blood pressure, lipids, vascular function (systemic arterial compliance and pulse-wave velocity), and endothelial function (flow-medicated vasodilation). Compared with the placebo group, soy recipients had a significant fall in blood pressiu-e (systolic, diastolic and mean). In the lipid analysis, significant reductions were observed in the low-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio and triglyceride levels, along with an increase in lipoprotein (a). Teede et al., "Dietary soy has both beneficial and potentially adverse cardiovascular effects: a placebo-controlled study in men and postmenopausal women", J Clin Endocrinol Metah, 86:3053^3060 (2001July).<br>
The industry that produces soy protein products for human consumption has grown enormously since the late 1950s. Since the 1960s, soy protein products have been used as nutritional and functional food ingredients in many food categories available to the consumer. Current production is about one billion pounds of protein products for human consumption per year in the United States - or about four to five pounds per person.<br>
The strong incentive for using low-cost vegetable sources of protein in the world economy has prompted the food industry to focus on vegetable proteins in food formulations.<br>
Soy protein products offer more than just the obvious economic advantages that vegetable proteins have over animal proteins. Advances in soy ingredient technology have resulted in products that can perform many fiinctions in foods such as emulsification, binding, and texture. Soy protein product acceptance has grown because of such functional properties, in addition to their excellent nutritional quality, abundance and low cost. However, the full potential of soy proteins for food applications has not yet been realized in regard to functionality, nutrition and new food concepts.<br><br>
Soy protein products are an ideal source of some of the essential amino acids used to complement cereal proteins. At present, soy proteins outrank many other food proteins in various worldwide nutrition programs. Yet the positive benefits associated with soy proteins are limited by certain undesirable properties of soy. One limitation is soy's poor organoleptic properties, e.g., a characteristic taste described as beanie, which limits the amount of soy protein that can be incorporated into a target product. It also necessitates the use of large amounts of taste/flavor masking agents which ultimately has a negative effect in regards to the food product's nutritional value.<br>
In addition, with some textured food products such as snack and protein bars, candies, cheese, etc., the total amount of soy protein that one may incorporate into them is limited due to the very high water absorption ratio of soy protein. Previously described soy protein concentrates can absorb up to 400% of their initial dry weight.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Described herein is a procedure that dramatically improves the organoleptic properties of a protein isolate, particularly soy protein isolates and concentrates, without detrimentally affecting the physical-chemical characteristics of the protein through denaturation. As used herein a protein isolate refers to a preparation firom vegetable or animal matter that has been cleaned, and for seeds dehulled, and is free of most of the oil and water soluble non-protein constituents. Such protein isolates include protein isolates and concentrates, e.g., soy protein isolates and concentrates and wheat protein concentrates which comprise at least about 70% protein on a moisture free basis, that are prepared routinely in the art and/or may be purchased from commercial companies, e.g., ADM Protein Specialists (Decatur, IL), Dupont Protein Technologies International (Wilmington, DE) or Calpro Ingredients (Corona, CA). Preferably the protein isolates are at least 70% protein on a moisture free basis. More preferably the protein isolates are at least about 90% protein on a moisture free basis. Most preferably the protein isolates are soy protein concentrates and soy protein isolates. Soy protein concentrates containing about 70% protein may be prepared from defatted meal by selective extraction of the soluble carbohydrates (sugars). Extraction with aqueous alcohol is the most common process for their production, but other methods of production are known in the art.   Soy protein<br><br>
isolates having protein concentrations of about 96% may be prepared by selective solubilization of the protein (e.g., alkaline extraction) followed by purification of the extract and precipitation of the protein (e.g., by acidification to the isoelectric point). The undesirable flavor of any protein, particularly a soy protein isolate or concentrate, e.g., Ardex R^" fi-om ADM, or Supro® 121 fi-om Dupont Protein Technologies, Intl., etc., becomes negUgible when treated according to the methods disclosed herein. Moreover, the disclosed method can substantially reduce water absorption by the protein. Thus another aspect of this invention is a protein isolate prepared by the methods of this invention wherein the protein isolate has a bland flavor and has a lower water adsorption ratio as compared to a protein isolate that is not prepared according to the methods of this invention. Using the protein isolates of this invention it is possible to increase the amount of protein that can be added to a variety of foodstuffs without conferring the characteristic flavor or odor of the particular protein isolate. This is particularly advantageous for soy protein isolates and concentrates which have undesirable organoleptic properties, e.g., soy's characteristic "beanie" soy taste and odor.<br>
The protein isolates, particularly soy protein concentrates and isolates, prepared by the methods of this invention may be used to prepare a variety of foods ah'eady known in the art, e.g., tofii, soy ice cream, grain-based food products, e.g., snack bars, breakfast cereals, pancakes, waffles, muffins, tortillas, breads, cakes and cookies, or protein bars, puddings, meal replacement formulations, e.g.. Slim Fast™ and Jeimy Craig™ liquid food diets wherein the meal replacement is a thick liquid, vegetarian foods, e.g., vegetarian "veggie" burgers, hot-dogs, deli slices, emulsion type sausages, fish sticks and meatballs, and meat replacements and candies. Everywhere soy protein is currently used, the prepared soy protein concentrates and isolates of this invention can be used, e.g., in soy burgers and soy hot dogs, soy ice cream and tofii. While beverages may also comprise the soy isolates of this invention, the isolates will not dissolve efficiently and thus will settle out which may be undesirable to many consumers. In addition, the protein isolates prepared by the methods of this invention make it possible for food formulators to use higher percentages of the protein isolates, particularly soy protein isolates and concentrates, in those food products that already comprise such isolates, e.g., food products that already comprise soy protein, and to use the protein isolates, particularly soy protein<br>
T<br><br>
isolates and concentrates of this invention in a wider variety of food products without substantially altering the taste and texture of the food products.<br>
An example disclosed herein is a soy protein bar wherein the level of soy protein concentrate is 53% by weight of the protein bar and still the protein bar has an acceptable taste and texture. This percentage of soy protein concentrates is at least twice the level of soy protein concentrates prepared by other methods that can be added to a protein bar without conferring a soy taste and odor. Products containing the soy protein concentrates of this invention have a moister texture than those containing similar amounts of other soy protein concentrates. The taste of the protein bars disclosed herein is noticeably better than the taste of the control made with the untreated soy protein concentrate which had an unmistakable beanie soy taste.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the method comprises mixing a protein isolate,, particularly a soy protein concentrate, with an aqueous solution of a polysaccharide, e.g., sucrose, fructose, cellulose or pectin, preferably a pectin, wherein the polysaccharide is present in the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to coat the protein. Preferably the ratio of the polysaccharide to protein in the aqueous solution is at least about 1/100 w/w, more preferably the ratio of polysaccharide to protein is about 1/100 w/w. The pH of the aqueous solution is preferably neutral to slightly acidic, e.g., about pH 7 to about pH 5.8. Preferably the aqueous solution consists essentially of water and the polysaccharide such that the protein isolate is coated with the polysaccharide. Thus, the methods of this invention are in contrast to other methods known in the art wherein the flavor is extracted from the protein isolate.<br>
Preferably the pectin is a low methoxyl pectin powder, either conventional or amidated, preferably amidated. The polysaccharide is mixed with water to prepare an aqueous polysaccharide solution. Preferably the polysaccharide and water are mixed at a temperature of about 18°C to about 50**C. The protein isolate and aqueous polysaccharide solution may be mixed in any suitable mixer known in the art, e.g., a high shear mixer, a rotary mixer or a planetary mixer. The protein isolate and aqueous polysaccharide solution are mixed for sufficient time and sufficient agitation to coat the protein with polysaccharide.   For example, when the protein<br><br>
isolate is initially mixed with the aqueous solution it is heavy and resembles a paste, as the protein becomes coated by the polysaccharide the mixture becomes very smooth, shiny and silky. A sufficiently mixed solution looks like an unctous creamy mixture. One of skill in the art can easily adjust the mixing times to sufficiently coat the protein without using undue experimentation. For example the protein and aqueous polysaccharide mixture may be mixed in a high shear mixer for about 1 minute to about 5 minutes at low speed and then about 3-5 minutes at medium speed, although these times may be adjusted easily for a particular type of mixer. After mixing, the aqueous polysaccharide and protein mixture is dried to a powder form. The aqueous polysaccharide and protein mixture may be dried, for example by vacuum drying or spray drying.<br>
The prepared protein isolate of this invention, particularly soy protein concentrate and wheat protein concentrate, may be incorporated into many food products. For example it may be incorporated into farinaceous food products, e.g., snack bars, breakfast cereals, breads, pancakes, doughnuts, cakes, mufiSns, or tortillas, and energy bar formulations, puddings, meal replacement formulations, e.g.. Slim Fast^^ and Jenny Craig^^ liquid food diets wherein the meal replacement is a thick liquid, vegetarian foods, e.g., vegetarian burgers, hot dogs, deli meats, emulsion type sausages, fish sticks and meatballs, soy ice cream, tofii, meat replacements, or candies.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention the method comprises steps to "customize" the flavor profiles of tiie treated protein isolate. For example, a finit or meat flavoring, e.g. a beef, chicken, fish or pork flavoring used commonly in the art, which do not alter the coating effects of the polysaccharide, can be added to the aqueous solution prior to mixing in the polysaccharide. For example, a customized flavor would be a "Beef Flavored" protein isolate to be used in vegetarian "veggy" burgers.<br>
The methods of this invention can be applied to any commercially available protein isolate, preferably not a protein isolate that is a highly soluble protein. Suitable protein isolates include, among others, rice protein concentrates, soy protein concentrates, whey protein concentrates, wheat protein concentrates and crustacean, e.g., shrimp, protein concentrates and fish protein concentrates.  The methods of this<br><br>
invention can also be used in conjunction with machinery that is commonly used with protein isolates, particularly soy protein concentrates.<br>
The protein isolate produced by the methods of this invention has a slightly lower protein content than the "parent" protein isolate. The protein content reduction is approximately 2% of moisture free basis (mfb). For example, some currently available soy protein isolates typically have a 90% protein content. When processed through the methods of this invention, the protein content is reduced to 88%. In addition, the protein isolates of this invention have a low water adsorption ratio, i.e., the water adsorption ratio is reduced to about 40% to about 65% or less than the water adsorption ratio of the "parent" protein isolate that has not been treated with the methods of this invention. Water adsorption ratio described herein is measured by determining the dry weight of the parent protein isolate, which has not been treated with the methods of this invention, and the protein isolate of this invention, then fully hydrating the parent protein isolate and the protein isolate treated by the methods of this invention over a period of about one hour, centrifiiging the hydrated isolates at SSOO ipm for one hour, removing the supernatant (excess water) and determining the weight of the hydrated protein pellets. The ratio of the isolates hydrated weight to the isolate's dry weight is the water adsorption ratio (hydrated weight/dry weight). Thus in the case of soy proteins, much higher levels of the soy proteins of this invention, e.g., at least twice the level of other soy proteins, may be included in a variety of food products without conferring a beanie soy taste to the food product.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is a method for preparing compositions which comprise the protein isolates, prepared as described above, and yet the compositions have a water adsorption ration that is similar to or higher than the water adsorption ratio of the untreated protein. The compositions, like the protein isolates, do not have the beanie or bitter taste that is associated with the untreated protein isolates. The method comprises treating the protein isolates with an aqueous solution containing a combination of (1) a polysaccharide, preferably pectin, in order to coat the protein isolates, which blocks off the flavor of the protein molecule as well as serving as a moisture barrier, and (2) a fiber, preferably an hydrocolloid, e.g., glucomarman (Konjac Propol RS, Kyoei Konnyaku, hic. Japan). The fiber should be of a sufficient amount that the water adsorption ratio of the composition is about the<br>
^<br><br>
ratio of the untreated protein isolates. For example, for glucomannan the composition should comprise about 1.5% to about 4% glucomannan to protein (w/w). The fiber absorbs the water which is no longer absorbed by the treated protein isolates. The composition comprising the treated protein isolates and fiber are then dried to a powder form. The compositions of this invention are bland in taste, have a water absorption ratio about equal to or higher than the untreated protein isolates and can be used in a wide range of food products, e.g., meat replacements, sausage, hot-dogs, deli slice, emulsion type sausage, fish stick or meatballs, soy ice cream, dry beverage mixes, farinaceous food products, e.g., breads, pastas, waffles, pancakes, cakes, cookies etc. without adversely affecting flie organoleptic properties, e.g., taste, odor or texture, of the food products.<br>
