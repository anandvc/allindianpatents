A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR SUBSIDING FOAMING EVOLVING DURING AN IND   USTRIAL PROCESS AND AN IND  USTRIAL PROCESS PLANT COMPRISING THE SAME.<br>
NITIN SURESHRAO CHAVAN<br>
INDIAN<br>
FLAT NO 31, I BUILDING SUVARNANAGARI, PLOT NO 22 ERANDWANE, PUNE, PIN 411004 MAHARASHTARA, INDIA,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
NITIN SURESHRAO CHAVAN<br><br>
This invention relates to a device for subsiding foaming evolving during an industrial process.<br>
This invention also relates to a method and an industrial process plant, using the said device for subsiding foaming.<br>
More particularly , this invention relates to a device for subsiding foaming in an industrial process without using antifoaming / defoamer agents ,thereby making the said process quite economical . Further in some industrial processes ,such as fermentation process in food and beverage industry, besides eliminating antifoaming agents, gas scrubber unit used for recovering the alcohol escaping in vapour form along with carbon dioxide gas is also eliminated as well as consumption of water and power required for fermentation plant is reduced thereby substaillny reducing the cost of fermentation.<br>
Various industrial processes in which foam is formed due to gas evolution include fermentation processes of food and beverage industry, ink composition foaming process, adhesive composition foaming process, effluent or Biodegrading process evolving in Bio gas plants, secondary effluent treatment process using air sparge to keep mass in suspension evolving gases in aeration plant etc.<br>
In all such industrial processes gases are evolved and foaming is continuously occurring which is controlled by using antifoaming agents / de-foamer such as Turkey Red oil (TRO), silicon based antifoaming agents etc.<br>
The description here after is limited to fermentation process, for the sake of brevity. In fermentation process, chemical breakdown of a substance is taking place by bacteria, yeast or other micro -organisms, converting sugars to ethyl alcohol, evolving heat and carbon dioxide gas. Yeast can grow aerobically as well as anaerobically.<br>
For growth and multification of yeast utilizable organics (sugar) and source of the Nitrogen are required and in addition optimum environmental parameter are to be maintained. During conversion of sugar to ethyl alcohol ,energy is produced.<br><br>
For fermentation different substances and materials those are utilized by yeast are Glucose and Fructose, some yeast can utilize sugar like Maltose, Xylsoe, Galactose and the like. For industrial application producing ethyl alcohol raw materials containing above sugar and which are fermented by yeast are utilized. Mainly these materails are (i ) Sugar containing raw material like Sugar containing fruits, fruit juices such as Grape juice, Apple juice ,honey and even some flower like Mashua, etc . major sources for such sugar are sugar cane molasses, beet sugar molasses, sugar cane juice and the like.<br>
(ii) Starch containing raw materials like grains such as Rice, wheat Corn, Sorghum ,Bajara and the like Rice bran, Root crops are like Tapioca and tubers like Potato Sweet potato and the like.<br>
iii) Cellulose containing raw materials are saw mill residue, news prints, potato peelings, rice straw, corn stoves, peanut shells, wheat straw, coca, coffen Tobaccos and the like.<br>
For producing ethyl alcohol sugar cane molasses which is easy to store, easy to handle, having utilizable Carbon and Nitrogen source high osmotic pressure it reduced microbiological spoilage is used in diluted form. Water is the best source for dilution but spent wash and spent lees can also be utilized.<br>
For producing of ethyl alcohol from molasses or starch, fermentation process is carried out in a fermenter of a fermentation plant which is part of distillery. The fermentation process may be batch process or fed batch or continous fermentation process, carried out in a single fermentaer, double fermenter or batteries of fermenters.<br>
The existing fermentation process mainly comprises of following steps'.<br>
(a)	propagation of yeast in a culture vessel;<br>
(b)	feeding of diluted sugar solution such as molasses diluted with water or spent wash or spent lees or the like diluting media preferably through a static mixer, into a fermenter;<br><br>
(c)	circulation of the mass in the fermenter with  help    the of<br>
Circulation pump and preferably through a heat exchanger;<br>
(d)	addition of molasses, process water, process air, yeast ,nutrients<br>
into the fermenter and increasing it gradually , the process air is<br>
preferably added through air sparger at the bottom of the feremtner,<br>
and Nutrient are added at regular intervals or continuous, through<br>
Nutrient dosing system;<br>
e)	maintaining the desired process parameters like specific gravity, PH ( by adding Sulphuric acid) and Biocide (for controlling contamination of bacterial)and temperature of mass inside the fermenter;<br>
f)	observing the fermentation reaction, by evolution of Carbon Dioxide and foaming;<br>
(g) starting the feeding of antifoaming agents such as Turkey Red Oil to control the foaming in fermenter, through an antifoaming dosing system;<br>
(h)keeping carbon dioxide scrubber on line and feeding process water to the scrubber;<br>
(i) feeding the scrubbed water with alcohol back to the fermenter or t aking the same for distillation;<br>
j) keeping the level of the mass in the fermenter benig the desired level preferably 80 %of gross volume of the fermenter, by limiting the feeding, leaving about 20 % space for foaming;<br>
(k) transferring the fermented wash after completion of reaction, normally after 24 hours, to clarification section and then to distillation.<br>
In the typical example of Ethyl alcohol manufacturing plant (Distillery) having a capacity of 30 Kiloliter per day:<br>
A) NORMAL INPUT:<br><br>
i) The basic sugar containing raw material used is sugarcane molasses<br>
126 MT/Day having 40% w/w fermentable sugars at the rate of 3600<br>
Liter per hours(LPH)<br>
ii) Process water used for fermenter 277 M3 per day (11500 LPH)<br>
iii) Process water used for Carbon Di oxide scrubber:  14.5 M3/day<br>
(600LPH)<br>
iv) Nutrients: 50 kg/day<br>
v)Process air : 200NM3/hr<br>
vi)Anti foaming agnet:100 kg/day<br>
vii)Sulphuric acid as per requirement to control PH<br>
viii) Biocode: as per requirement t control contamination.<br>
NORMAL OUTPUT:<br>
i) Fermented wash 361 M3/ day<br>
ii) C02 generated: 22 MT<br>
iii) Scrubbed water with alcohol : 14.5 M3/Day<br>
In place of sugar cane molasses, sugar beet molasses or sugar cane juice can also be used . The quantity of process water may also be reduced by recycling of weak bear or spent wash or spent lees. Further the fermenter used may be one ,two, three or more, and the fermented process performed may be in batch mode or fedbatch or as a continuous process.<br>
Further a prefermenter may be used in which suagr solution of molasses,yeast, nutrients and process air is fed and the mass from prefermenter is transfered to main fermenter/s for the final reaction, generataing C02 and Alcohol vapur and major foaming. In this system process air may or may not be fed into the main fermenter.<br>
For non molasses fermentation also process steps are same as descrobed herin before but generally this is carried out in batch mode.<br>
The drawbacks, or limation or disadvantges of all the existing fermentation processes are as follows:<br>
I)For controlling the foaming ,antifoaming/defoamer agents such as Turkey Red Oil or Silicon antifoam or the like, required to be added into the fermenter through antifoaming agent dosing device which acts only to reduce the foam and cost about Rs. 3000/— per day which for 30 kilo liter per day capacity distillery plant.<br><br>
II)These   antifoaming   agents   are   not   taking   any   part   in   the<br>
fermentation   reaction   and   are   not   useful   for   enhancing   the<br>
fermentation reaction or yeast activity or to control the contamination<br>
and just added to control the foaming and depending upon the foam<br>
generation quantity added remains uncontrolled.<br>
III)Some time heavy addition of antifoaming agents reduces the PH of<br>
fermented wash drastically thereby changing the process parameter<br>
and  affecting  its  efficiency,  retention time,  sugar conversion  and<br>
alcohol quality.<br>
IV)Consumption of antifoaming agents varies with fermentation vessel<br>
or reactor volume or Height / Diameter ratio of fermenter or total<br>
input of the frmenter as well as the type of raw material and quality of<br>
the raw material.<br>
V)Due   to   addition   of  antifoaming   agents   utilizble      volume  the<br>
fermenter is proportionately reduced.<br>
VI)When excessive foaming occurs in the fermenter, which is not controlled by feeding the antifoaming agents, the foam enters the blow off or C02 lines. Some times fermenter gets overflow, resulting into loss of fermented mass / alcohol and creating unhygienic condtions around the fermenter. After some time the liquid foam in the lines becomes infected which drips into fermented mass resulting into infected mass and lower yield of alcohol.<br>
VII)The fermentation reaction is exothermic and evolves a lot of C02<br>
forming bubbles and foaming on the top surface of the mass in the<br>
fermenter. With the C02, alcohol vapours are also vented out and for<br>
the recovery of the alcohol, C02 Scrubber is used in which a part of<br>
process water	is also used, this invovoves cost of the scrubber<br>
unit, steel pipe line, support frame (costing about Rs.5 lakhs for 30 Kiloleter per day distillery ) as well as as cost of water used in scrubber along with the power requirement for feeding the water to scrubber.<br>
VIII)The scrubbed water with alcohol recovery is added to the fermenter which occupy the fermenter space, increases power consumption of the mass circulating pump and reduces the concentration of alcohol in the fermented mass which results in more consumption of steam in the distillery.<br>
The main object of this invention therefore, is to obviate the above said shortcomings, limitations or disadvantages of the existing fermentation process as well as all the foam evolving industrial process and to provide a device for subsiding foaming evolving in an Industrial process without using an antifoam/ defoaming agent.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to be provide a device for subsiding foaming evolving in an Industrial process in which C02 Scrubber required in a fermentation plant is eliminated, along with its, support frame structure and pipe lines for feeding process water and collecting scrubbed water having alcohol and Carbondioxide with alcohol vapour carrying lines.<br>
A further oject of this invention is to provide a device for subsiding foaming evolving in an industrial process in which process water consumption is reduced portionate to the water fed to the C02 scrubber in the existing fermentation process.<br>

A further object of this invention is to provide a device for susding foaming evoving in an indrusrial process in which steam consumption in distillery is reduced, propotionate to the dilution of alcohol in the fermented mass due to additon of scuruubed water with alcohol in the fermented mass.<br>

Now referring to FIGS 1 and 2, the fermentation plant, used for carrying out fermentation process, known in the prior art, mainly comprises at least one fermenter or reactor(l). However there may be a battery of fermenters containing two, three, four or even more fermenter in a series.Molasses(2),a sugar based raw material, diluted with water(3) and or with any other<br><br>
diluent such as spent wash or spent lees, preferably by using a static mixer(4) is fed into the fermenter(l). In place of molasses, sugarcane juice or other sugar based raw materials can also be used. Activated yeast mass (5) and Nutrients (6) are also fed into the fermenter for activating the reaction. Process air (7) is also preferable fed through air sparger(8) at the bottom of the fermenter(l). The fermenter mass is circulated with the help of circulation pump(9) which is also preferably cooled in a heat exchanger/ fermented wash cooler (10).<br>
Fermentation process being an exothermal reaction C02(ll) is generated which comes out in the form of bubbles and foaming(12)evolves at the upper portion of the fermenter. To control foaming antifoaming agents (13) such as Turkey Red Oil or Silicon Antifoaming are added with the help of antifoaming metering device. C02 also invloves alcohol in vapor form and to prevent the loss of alcohol, the C02 along with alcohol vapours(14) is taken to a C02 scrubber(15) in which process water (16) is fed.to disolve and recover thewhich is fed back to fermenter(l) along with scrubbed) water(17) and C02 is vented out through the vent(18).<br>
When foam forming incerese ,more quanitity of anttfoaming agents is fed to the fermenter which not only increases the cost but also affects the efficiency , process parameters like PH. Sometimes foam enters C02 line causing development of bacteria which falls into the fermenter mass creating contamination resulting into poor quality of alcohol. Biocides are required to be added to control Bacterial which also increases the cost. Due to continuous addition of antifoaming agents as well as scrubbed water, more and more space of fermenter is occupied by non active materials resulting into high pressure inside the fermenter and reducing the capacity of fermenter. Sometimes the foaming oozes out of the fermenter creating unhygienic conditions around the fermenter.<br>
FIG 2 shows the use of two fermenters ar connected in series and the same circulation pump(9) and heat exchanger (10) being used for circulation of mass in both the fermenters. A prefermenter(19) is used in which diluted molasses, yeast and nutrients are fed, process air is sparged and the prefermented mass is transferred to the one or both fermenters (1) for the final reaction. C02 along with alcohol vapours from both the fermenter is fed to C02 scrubber(15) where process water(16)<br><br>
is sparged to disolve the alcohol and the scrubbed water with alcohol (17) is sent to wash tank(20). Antifoaming agent (13) is fed to both the fermenter, as per requirement. For a 30 Kilo liter per day distllery it is observed that the antifoaming agents costing about Rs. 3000/- per day are required and water for scrubber required is 600 LPH.<br>
Now referring to FIGs 3 to 13 the device(21) for subsiding foaming (12) evolving during an industrial process such as fermentation process without using any antifoaming agent is an air and water sparge producing device provided at the top portion ,inside the fermenter (1) or each of the fermenters or reactors. The device (21) mainly comprises a header (22) provided with a pluarity of sockets (23) around its periphery for supporting a plurality of radial arms(24) formed of thin pipes of the length selected according to the inner diameter of the fermenter. Each of the arm is connected to respected sockets at one end preferably by threading or by any other joining means. Each of the arm (24) is provided with a plurality of holes or bunch of holes (25) in spaced apart manner distributed along its length. Each bunch of holes(25) preferably consist of three holes , one in vertical downward direction and two inclined at an angel of 30 to 60 , more preferably 45 form the vertical. The header (22) is connected to a process water(3) supply line preferably by using suitable extension pipe (32) and flanges(26) and supported at the top end (27) of the fermenter(l).The header (22) is also connected with process air supply line( 7).<br>
For a non limiting typical example each arm (24) is of 40mm. diameter, holes (25) are of 2mm diameter and pitch of the holes (25) is 250mm.<br>
Preferably in case of a larger fermenter the radial arms (24) are interconnected with peripheral arms (28) with the help of sockets (29) fixed to radial arms (24)<br>
At the bottom closed end (30) of the header (22), preferably a spiral sparged pipe (31), having holes (25) is provided, which is connected to the header (22)for receiving process water and air. Alternatively the closed end (30) of header(22) is provided with a plurality of holes (25).<br><br>
According to another embodiment of this invention a device for subsiding foaming evolving in an industrial processes without using antifoaming agent/defoamer, comprises a plurality of concentric ring pipes(34) connected to the process water line at the end and being mounted at the top inside surface of the vessel in which foaming occurs during the industrial process, each of the sad ring pipes being provided with a plurality of holes(25) and each of said ring pipe connected to the process water pipe or the like fluid source. As shown in FIG no 12 .<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention a device for subsiding foaming evolving in an industrial process without using antifoaming agent/ defoamer , comprises a spiral ring pipe(25) provided with plurality of holes(25) at tis lower surface and connected to the process water line at the end, and being mounted at the top inside surface of the vessel in which foaming occurs during the industrial process, the said spiral ring being connected at the free end to process water pipe or like fluid source ,as shown in FIG no 13.<br>
An extension pipe / piece (32) with flange (26) is provided for adjusting the position of the device (21) inside the fermenter(l) as per requirement.<br>
In some processes where foaming is occurring vigorously the header (22) is provided in two or more vertical planes one above another, keeping the sockets and radial arms staggered so that radial arms of one set do not cover the radial arms of the set below it, but will cover the space left out in between the two adjacent radial arms of the set just below it, thereby air and water jets produced cover the whole space at the top surface of the fermenter for instantly subsiding foaming.<br>
The device (21) is placed at the inside top surface of the fermenter, supported at the top inlet of it. The device (21) is connected to process water (3) and air (7) lines and as soon as C02 and foaming evolves air and water in the form of jets start spraying through holes (25) which covers the whole space and subsides the foaming completely.<br>
In addition to process water (3) spent wash or spent lees (34) may also to be feed to the device (21). The alcohol vapour formed with C02 also comes in contact with the water sprayed by the device (21) and is dissolved in water and remain in the fermenter, leaving only C02 to be vented out through the<br><br>
vent(33).As there is no need of C02 scrubber which is now eliminated along with its pipe lines and support frame. Water supply to C02 scrubber is not require therefore saving of water consumption and power consumption used in feeding the water to scrubber.<br>
There is no need of anyantifoaminq agent as the foaming is completely subsided / control led by the device and therefore saving on the cost of antifoaming agent as well as antifoaming metering / feeding system, connecting piping and piping support. There is no eliment, like antifoaming agent, which does not take part in the reaction/fermentation process, being added to the fermenter hence the process parameters are not affected and efficiency is enhanced. Space that is occupied by the antifoaming agent and scrubbed water is utilized for feeding more sugar solution; thereby utilizable space of the fermenter is increased therefore productivity is more. The same process water /spent wash / spent lees and the process air which is required to be continuously fed to the fermenter is now utilized in the device for creating air and water sparge/jet for controlling / subsiding the foaming and now there is no antifoaming agent, and scrubbed water, therefore for the same capacity mass circulation recirculated by the pump is reduced thereby saving of the power used for circulation pump . As there is no extra mass, there is no rise in pressure inside the fermenter.Foaming is subsided instantly hence no chance of any foaming entering into vent or oozing out of the fermenter and hence hygienic conditions are maintained around the fermenter as well as no chance of any Bacteria developing in the vent and dripping back into the fermenter, contaminating the fermented mass hence the cost of Biocide is saved and high quality and higher yield of alcohol / fermenrted mass is achieved. Also process parameter like PH is not affected, as there is no antifoaming agent there for.Further the scrubbed water with alcohol not added to the mass hence the concentration of alcohol in the fermented mass is comparatively more which reduces steam consumption in the distillation thereby proportionately reducing the power consumption. With the use of the device (21) for subsiding foaming which does not require antifoaming agent, process parameters are maintained and reaction time is reduced conversion efficiency is increased, alcohol recovery per unit of sugar input is increased, yeast activity is maintained and<br><br>
