CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korea Patent Application No. 2003-3234 filed on January 17, 2003 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for providing information on unfinished calls. More specifically, the present invention relates to a device and method for providing wired and wireless unfinished call transmission information.<br>
(b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
Unfinished calls include cases of failing to contact a person since a telephone of the person is turned off, the line is busy, the person does not answer, the call is switched, the call is rejected, or the call is connected to a voice mailbox.<br>
The current mobile communication system generally provides two services for providing        call        transmission        information        on        unfinished        calls.<br>
First, Korea publication no. 2002-76027 entitled "Method and system for displaying call sender information by using wireless Internet" with application no. 10-2001-15977 disclosed a technique for providing a service of displaying call sender information through the wireless Internet. The technique converts information of all calls generated through wired telephones into predetermined messages and transmits them to mobile stations, but it transmits a huge volume of SMS messages since it problematically transmits information on all calls transmitted through wired telephones, and it must modify call processes of all the exchanges since the technique attempts a call connection to a call-receiving telephone after transmitting an SMS message to a mobile station which is designated by the call-receiving telephone or concurrently when transmitting the SMS message. Also, it is impossible to apply the above-described technique to a case when an old-fashioned exchange that has no function of transmitting sender information is applied to the PSTN (public switched telephone<br>
network).<br>
The second technique transmits a message to a corresponding mobile station subsequent to when a call receiving mobile station fails to receive a call in a mobile communication network because of any of multiple problems of the call receiving mobile station. However, the second technique cannot be applied to the PSTN since the<br><br>
second technique only provides transmission information of unfinished calls in the mobile communication network.<br>

In the following detailed description, only the preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated by the inventor(s) of carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of modification in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not restrictive.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of a device for providing wired and wireless unfinished call transmission information according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the device for providing wired and wireless unfinished call transmission information comprises: a PSTN 100 including first and second wired telephones 110a andl 1 Ob, first and second exchanges 120a and 120b, and a CMS (call number information service) 130; and a mobile communication network 200 including first and second mobile stations210a and210b, third and fourth exchanges 220a and 220b, and an SMS (short message service) unit 230. The SMS unit 230 comprises an SMSC (short message service center) 231 and an SMSG (short message service gateway) 232.<br>
The first and second exchanges 120a and 120b in the PSTN 100 determine whether a call generated to the first and second cable telephones! 10a andll Ob is<br><br>
unfinished, and whether a subscriber of the corresponding first and second cable telephones 110a andl 1 Ob has entered an unfinished call information providing service, and they are connected to the CNIS 130 to transmit information on the unfinished call thereto when predefined conditions are satisfied.<br>
The CNIS 130 is linked to the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b, receives unfinished call-transmitting information from the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b, composes it into an SMS message, and transmits the SMS message to a designated mobile station of the mobile communication network. In this instance, connection of the first and second cable telephones 110a andl 10b with the CNIS 130 and information transmission there between are realized by a method using the SS7 (signaling system no. 7) call, a method of using the TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol), and a method of virtually setting a call and connecting the call.<br>
The method of using the SS7 is to switch the call from the call- receiving first and second exchanges 120a and 120b to the CNIS 130 when the call satisfies an unfinished notifying condition, and transmit information on a call-transmitting subscriber and a call-receiving subscriber to the CNIS 130, and the method is realized without modifying functions of the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b.<br>
Also, the method of generating a virtual call to the CNIS 130 by the call-receiving first and second exchanges 120a and 120b to transmit information of the call-transmitting subscriber and the call-receiving subscriber can also be used, and this method requires a function of connecting a virtual call to the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b.<br>
The method of using the TCP/IP is to connect the TCP/IP to the CNIS 130 when the call is unfinished at the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b to thereby transmit information of the call-transmitting subscriber and the call-receiving subscriber. The SMS message composed by the CNIS 130 is transmitted to the designated first and second mobile stations210a and 210b through the SMS unit 230 of the mobile communication network 200.<br>
The CNIS 130 for providing a wired and wireless unfinished call transmitting information service will now be described.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a configuration of the CNIS 130 of FIG. 1 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the CNIS 130 comprises a VMS (voice mailing system) 131, a message storage unit 132, a database 133, a connector 134, a message receiver 135, a message processor 136, a message composer 137, a message transmitter 138, and an SMS connector 139.<br>
The CNIS 130 is connected to the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b through the connector 134, and the message receiver 135 receives messages from the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b.<br>
In this instance, connection of the first and second exchanges 120a and 120b to the CNIS 130 is performed by using a call switching method, a virtual call connecting method, and a connecting method by using a TCP/IP. A general exchange is applicable to the call switching method without modifying the exchange, and predetermined modification is needed so as to add corresponding functions to the exchanges in the cases of connecting the virtual call, and performing connection using the TCP/IP.<br>
Information on a call transmitting subscriber number, a call transmitting subscriber category, a call receiving subscriber number, and an unfinished reason is extracted from the message processor 136. Here, the call transmitting subscriber category is caused by an event that is from where a call from a call transmitting subscriber is provided, and it is classified as a public telephone and an international telephone.<br>
The message processor 136 checks a call transmitting number and a call receiving number, provides a voice guide broadcast so that a call transmitter may manually input a desired call transmitting number when the call transmitting number is incorrect, and processes a call transmitting number as an unknown call transmitting number when the call transmitting subscriber as input the incorrect call transmitting number.<br>
The message processor 136 selectively provides a voice message service according to adding states of the VMS 131 to the CNIS 130, extracts a mobile station number and a call transmitting area number assigned to the call receiving number from the database 133 according to additional service subscriber information, and records time information.<br>
The database 133 stores call transmitting area information using call transmitting area numbers so as to determine a call transmitting area by using a call transmitting telephone number, and provide the call transmitting area information. A<br><br>
message or a voice message left by the call transmitting person is stored in the message storage unit 132 so that a call receiving person may check it through the mobile station 210. In this instance, the mobile station 210 uses a system such as the VMS to check the voice message.<br>
The message composer 137 generates an SMS message including the call transmitting subscriber information and time information through the designated mobile station number extracted from the message processor 136, stores the generated SMS message in the message storage unit 132, and the message transmitter 138 transmits the SMS message to the SMS unit 230 through the SMS connectorl39. In this instance, the reason for storing the generated SMS message in the message storage unit 132 is to transmit the corresponding SMS message again to the designated mobile station periodically or for a predetermined number of times until the transmission is normally finished when the SMS message is not normally transmitted to the mobile station in the mobile communication network, and in addition, the message storage unit 132 stores the SMS message for a predetermined time frame (several months) so as to generate the SMS message into billing data and provide corresponding usage information to the subscriber.<br>
The CNIS 130 receives a transmission finished message on the transmitted SMS message, and attempts retransmission according to a predefined period or a number of times when not receiving the transmission finished message, thereby finishing the message transmission.<br>
A detailed operation for a wired and wireless unfinished call transmitting information   providing   service   using   the   CNIS   130   will   now   be   described.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an operational flowchart of a method for providing wired and wireless unfinished call transmission information according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a call transmitting part attempts a call connection to a call receiving part which includes a wired telephone in step S301, and when the call connection fails in step S302, it is determined whether the corresponding wired telephone is registered as a call receiving part subscriber to the unfinished call transmitting information providing service in step S303. In this instance, the call receiving part is the second wired telephone 110b, and the second exchange 120b is the<br><br>
call receiving exchange to connect the unfinished call and transmit the message in the configuration of FIG. 1.<br>
When the connection is successful in the step S302, a call is allowed in step S313, and when the connection fails and is therefore an unfinished call in step S302, and the wired telephone is not registered to the unfinished call transmitting information providing service in step S303, the call is finished. When the call receiving part subscriber is found to be registered to the unfinished call transmitting information providing service according to the determination result of the step S303, a call transmitting telephone number and a call receiving telephone number are extracted in step S304, and a call connection is switched to the CNIS 130 from the call receiving part second exchange 120b in step S3 05.<br>
When the call is switched from the second exchange 120b, the CNIS 130 receives the call receiving signal through the SS7 call connection in step S306, extracts call receiving and call transmitting information of the corresponding call in step S3G7, and checks whether the call transmitting number is a normal number in step S308. When the call transmitting number is found to be not normal according to the checking result of the step S308, a message to guide the subscriber to input a desired telephone number is transmitted to the call transmitting part subscriber so as to receive it manually in step S314, and when the call transmitting number is found to be normal, an SMS message including call transmitting number information and call receiving time information is generated in step S309, and a mobile station number designated by the call receiving part second wired telephonellOb is also extracted in step S315.<br>
The generated SMS message is stored in the database 133 of the CNIS 130 in step S310, and transmitted in step S311 to the mobile station number extracted in the step S315. The transmitted SMS message is transmitted to the SMS unit 230 of the mobile communication network 200, and transmitted to the call receiving mobile station according to a general SMS message transmission sequence. The CNIS 130 retransmits the SMS message periodically or for a specific number of times until the CNIS receives a message that the transmission of the corresponding SMS message is finished from the mobile communication network 200.<br>
Also, the call transmitting part includes wired telephones and wireless telephones, and when the call receiving art is a wired telephone, the corresponding call receiving part exchange determines unfinished call states, and switches the call to the<br><br>
CN1S to generate an unfinished call transmitting information message and transmit the same.<br>
As described, when the call received at the wired telephone is unfinished because of states of the wired telephone or conditions of the subscriber, the device and method for providing a wired and wireless unfinished call transmitting information providing service allows the CNIS to provide call transmitting information while the exchange in the PSTN has no additional function of providing unfinished call transmitting information, thereby providing call transmitting information on the unfinished call from among the calls received at the wired network as well as the mobile communication network.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

a CNIS (call number information service) for analyzing the call receiving signal switched from the exchange, determining normal states of call transmitting number information, receiving normal call transmitting number information, generating an unfinished call transmitting information providing message, and transmitting the message to a mobile station predefined by the wired telephone subscriber; and<br>
a SMS (short message service) unit of the mobile communication network, for transmitting the unfinished call transmitting information providing message transmitted     by     the     CNIS     to     a     corresponding     mobile     station.<br>
2.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the exchange has a TCP/IP<br>
(transmission control protocol/Internet protocol) for connecting the call receiving<br>
signal to the CNIS by using the TCP/IP.<br>
3.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the CNIS comprises:<br>
a connector for connecting the call receiving signal switched from the exchange;<br>
a message receiver for receiving call transmitting information and call receiving information from the exchange;<br><br>
a message processor for extracting a call transmitter number and a call receiver number from the message received at the message receiver, determining normal states of the extracted call transmitter number, and searching mobile station number information designated to the corresponding call receiver number;<br>
a message composer for generating an unfinished call transmitting information message to be transmitted to the mobile station number searched by the message processor;<br>
a message transmitter for transmitting the unfinished call transmitting information message generated by the message composer; and<br>
a SMS connector for transmitting the unfinished call transmitting information message transmitted by the message transmitter to the SMS unit of the mobile communication network.<br>
4. The system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the CNIS comprises:<br>
a VMS (voice mailing system) for operating the message processor to allow the call transmitting part user to record a voice guide message for requiring a manual input process of call transmitting number information or a voice message desired by the call transmitting part user when the call transmitting information is not normal;<br>
a database for storing mobile station number information designated to the corresponding call receiver number searched by the message processor, and storing call transmitting area numbers according to telephone numbers when call transmitting area information of a call transmitter is provided as additional information; and<br>
a  message   storage  unit  for  storing  an  unfinished  call   transmitting information message generated by the message composer.<br>
5. A device for providing a wired and wireless unfinished call transmitting information service to a wired telephone subscriber in a wired telephone network including   an   exchange   for   connecting   a   call   received   through   a   mobile<br><br>
communication or wired network, and the wired telephone subscriber who receives the call received at the exchange, the device comprising:<br>
a connector for connecting the call receiving signal  switched from the exchange;<br>
a message receiver for receiving call transmitting information and call receiving information from the exchange;<br>
a message processor for extracting a call transmitter number and a call receiver number from the message received by the message receiver and determining whether the call transmitter number extracted is normal, and searching mobile station number information designated to the corresponding call receiver number;<br>
a VMS (voice mailing system) for operating the message processor to allow the call transmitting part user to record a voice guide message for requiring a manual input process of call transmitting number information or a voice message desired by the call transmitting part user when the call transmitting information is not normal;<br>
a database for storing mobile station number information designated to the corresponding call receiver number searched by the message processor;<br>
a message storage unit for storing an unfinished call transmitting information message generated by the message composer;<br>
a message composer for generating an unfinished call transmitting information message to be transmitted to the mobile station number searched by the message processor;<br>
a message transmitter for transmitting the unfinished call transmitting information message generated by the message composer; and<br>
a SMS connector for transmitting the unfinished call transmitting information message transmitted by the message transmitter to the SMS unit of the mobile communication network.<br><br>
6. A method for providing unfinished call transmitting information in a system for providing a wired and wireless unfinished call transmitting information service, wherein the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	allowing the exchange to attempt a connection and determine whether the corresponding call receiving signal is unfinished when a call is received at the wired telephone subscriber;<br>
(b)	allowing the exchange to extract call transmitting number information and call receiving number information of the corresponding call, transmit them to the CNIS, and switch a connection of the corresponding call receiving signal to the CNIS when the corresponding call receiving signal is an unfinished call and the corresponding call receiving subscriber is an unfinished call transmitting information providing service subscriber according to the determination result;<br>
(c)	allowing the CNIS to analyze call transmitting number information and call receiving number information transmitted by the exchange, extracting a mobile station number designated by the corresponding wired telephone subscriber, and generating an unfinished call transmitting information message; and<br>
(d) temporarily storing the generated unfinished call transmitting information message, and transmitting the message to the mobile communication network so that the message may be transmitted to the corresponding mobile station number in the SMA message format.<br>
7. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the step(c) comprises the steps of:<br>
allowing  the  CNIS  to  determine  whether the  call  transmitting  number<br>
information received from the exchange is normal; and<br>
requiring the call transmitting part subscriber to input a normal call transmitting<br>
telephone number and receiving normal call transmitting number information when the<br>
corresponding	call	transmitting	number	is	not	normal<br>
according to the determination result.<br><br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the call receiving part subscriber requests an unfinished call transmitting information providing service, and the mobile station number information is predefined in (c).<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the step (d) comprises the steps of:<br>
transmitting the unfinished call transmitting information message transmitted from the mobile communication network to the designated mobile station, and checking normal transmission finish states; and<br>
notifying the CNIS of a fact that the unfinished call transmitting information message is normally transmitted from the mobile communication network when the message is found to be normally transmitted according to a checking result.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the CNIS again transmits the<br>
corresponding unfinished call transmitting information message periodically or for a<br>
predetermined number of times for each predefined time frame when failing to be<br>
notified of a normal transmission finish report on the unfinished call transmitting<br>
information message from the mobile communication network.<br>
11.	A system and device for providing a wire and wireless unfinished call<br>
