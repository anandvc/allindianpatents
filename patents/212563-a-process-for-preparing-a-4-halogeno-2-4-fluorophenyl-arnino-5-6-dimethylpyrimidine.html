BACKGROUND ART<br>
5,6-Dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylanuno)-4-(l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetra-hydroisoquinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine of the above formula (I) inhibits gastric acid secretion by means of a reversible proton-pump inhibiting effect and. therefore, can be used as an anti-ulcer agent. This compound was developed by the inventors of the present invention, who then applied fur patents for the compound and/or its method of preparation in Korea and other countries (see International Publication No. WO 96/05177).<br>
According to the method disclosed in the above patent application, 5.6-dimethyt-2-(4-fluorophenyIamino)-4-(l-methyl-lI213,4-tetrahydroii,()<i uinolin-2-yl is prepared according to the following reaction scheme a-></i>
\Reaction Scheme-A<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Since the starting material of the above reaction scheme has two reactive sites (i.e., the two Ci atoms), the first reaction inevitably produces a side product, which reduces the yield of the desired compound.<br>
The present inventors have Jong labored to develop a novel method for preparing S,6-dimethyl-2j(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoiin-2-yl)pyriinidine of formula (!) without producing side products. As a result, we have discovered that the desired compound of formula (I) can be efficiently prepared without side products by reacting the pyrimidine derivative represented by formula (II-A) with l-mettiy|-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline represented by-formula (HI) and, thus, have completed the present invention.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparation of 5.6-dimechyl-2-(4-fluorophenylainino)-4-(l-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroiso-tiuinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine represented by formula (I) and its acid additionsalts.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of 5,6-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-1.2,3,4-tetrahydroUoqiiinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine represented by fonnula (I),<br><br><br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of the pyrimidine derivative of formula (D-A) and the compound of fonnula (III).<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a novel intermediate compound represented by the following formula (II), which includes the pyrimidine derivative represented by formula (n-A),<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
in which R represents hydroxy or a halogen.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, the compound of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting the compound of formula (II-A) with l-methyl-1.2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline of formula (II), as depicted in the following reaction scheme 1'<br>
Reaction scheme 1<br><br>
(Formula Removed)  <br><br><br>
Since the starting compound of the reaction scheme 1 (i.e., the compound of formula (II-A)) contains a single reactive site (i.e., Hal), this reaction scheme does not produce any side product and, thus, optimizes the yield of the compound of formula (I), the desired product.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail below.<br><br>
Although the 4-halogeno-2-(4-fluonJphenylamino)-5,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine represented by formula (Ef-A) can be reacted according to the present invention with an equivalent amount of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetra-hyclroisoquinoline represented by formula (III), it is preferable to conduct the reaction using an excess, rather than an equivalent amount, of the latter. Since the latter is a liquid under reaction conditions, the unreacted l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline can be readily removed after the reaction has gone to completion.<br>
The reaction of the present invention is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Solvents which may be used for this purpose include N.N-dimethylformamide, n-butanol, n-pcntanol, n-hexanol, dimethylsuUoxide, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. Of these propylene glycol and ethylene glycol are most preferred, since use of either of these minimizes both reaction time and production of side products.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the reaction scheme 1 is generally carried out in the presence of a base. Bases which can he used for this purpose include triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine arid potassium acetate. The reaction temperature fur the reaction between the compound of formula (H-A) and 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline of formula (ffl) is preferably in the range from llOt to 160T and the reaction time is preferably in the range from 16 hours to 72 hours.<br>
5,6-Dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-1.,2,3,4-tetra-hydroisoquinolin-2-yI)pyrimidine of formula (I) as prepared according to die above method can be converted into its acid addition salt, preferably into die hydrochloride salt, by conventional methods. The resulting product can be purified by conventional working-up procedures, such as recrystallization, chromatography, and the like.<br>
Since the compound of formula (I) prepared by the method of the present invention contains an asymmetric carbon atom (i.e., the carbon<br><br>
atom denoted by * in the formula immediately below), this compound be present in an (R)-(-O-isomer, an (S)-(-)-isomer, or a racemate wherein the R and S isomers are mixed in the ratio of l;l. Unless indicated otherwise, the compound of formula (I) should be interpreted to include all of these isomers.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The (R)-(+)- and (S)-(-)- isomers of the compound of formula (I) can be readily be prepared from the R and S isomers, respectively, of the compound of formula (III).<br>
The compound of formula (II-A), which is used as the starting material in the method of the present invention, is a novel compound which can be prepared according to the method depicted by the following reaction scheme 2:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In the reaction scheme 2, Hal represents a halogen.<br>
As depicted by the reaction scheme 2, reacting 4-fluorophenyl-guanidine carbonate of formula (IV) with ethyl 2-methylacetoacetate of formula (V) yields 4-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-5,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine of formula (II-B), which may then be reacted with a halogenating agent to obtain the 4-halogeno-2-(4-fluorophenylarninn-) 5,6-dimethylpyrimitiine of formula (H-A).<br>
4-Fluorophenylguanidine carbonate of formula (IV), which is used as the starting material for preparing the compound of formula (II-A) in the reaction scheme 2, can readily be prepared from 4-fluoroaniline using known methods (see, for example, European Patent No. 0,560,726). Specifically, the desired 4-fluorophenylguanidine carbonate can be prepared by reacting 4-fluoroaruline with a 50% cyanamide solution under acidic conditions using 30% to 37% hydrochloric acid while maintaining the temperature ranging from 75 to 951.<br>
The first step of the reaction scheme 2 may be practiced in the presence of a solvent. Solvents which may be used for this purpose include acetonkrile, N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide This<br>
reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature ranging from 11.0 "C to 160ºC.<br>
In the second step of the, reaction scheme 2, 4-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorophenylanuno)-5,6-dimethylpyriniidine of formula (II-B) obtained from the first step Of the reaction scheme 2 is converted into the compound of formula (II-A) by reacting the former with a halogenating agent. Halogenating agents which can be used for this purpose include phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride and phosphorus tribromide. This halogenation reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent. Reaction solvents which can be used for this purpose include preferably N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, 1,2-dichloroethane and l,2-dichloroben2ene. It is preferable to maintain the reaction temperature in the range from 75ºC to 95ºC.<br>
Although the second step of the reaction scheme 2 can be practiced by isolating the intermediate after the first reaction step has been completed, it is preferable to conduct the first and second steps in a single vessel. Specifically, 4-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-5,6-climeihylguanidine of formula (II-B) is prepared from 4-fluorophenyl-guanidine cabonate and then, without isolation, can be successively reacted with the halogenating agent to yield 4-halogeno-2-(4-fluoro-phenylammo)-5,6-dimethylpyrimidine (II-A).<br>
The compound of formula (II-A), which is used as the starting material for preparation of the compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, is novel, as is the compound of formula (II-B) produced as the intermediate in the reaction scheme 2. Both novel compounds can he represented by the following formula (II), which is within the scope of the present invention,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in<br><br>
which R represents hydroxy or a halogen.<br><br>
l-Methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline of formula (III), which is also used as the starting material in the reaction scheme 1, is a known compound and can be preapred by known methods (see, for example, International Publication No. WO 94/14795). According to this known method, (R)- or (S)-l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is prepared by reacting (R)- or (S)-methylbenzylamine with a -chloro- a -(methyl-thio)-acetylchloride and stannous chloride (SnCh) to produce (R)- or (S)-l-methyl-4-methylthio-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-3-one, respectively, then reacting the resulting compound with Raney nickel to remove a methylthio group, and finally adding a reducing agent. However, this method is disadvantageous, since a -chloro- a -(methylthio)-acetylchloride, which is used as the starting material, is both unstable and explosive, so that this method cannot be practiced on an industrial scale. Further, since the reaction step is long, the total yield is low, which makes this method uneconomical.<br>
The present inventors have long labored to find a more efficient method for producing l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoQuinoline. We have discovered that l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline can be employed economically and safely by successively reacting a -methylbenzylainine with 2-bromoethanol, a brominating agent, and a Lewis acid. Such a process for preparing l-methyl-l,2,3.4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is novel and is encompassed within the scope of the present invention. This novel process for preparing l~methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquim&gt;line is explained in more detail below.<br>
According to the present invention, 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinoline of formula (IT!) can be prepared by reacting a-methyl-benzylamine successively with 2-bromoethanol, a brominating agent and Lewis acid. The method of the present invention employs the following reaction scheme 3.<br><br>
Reaction scheme 3<br><br>
(Formula Removed<br>
All of the starting materials and reactants used in the reaction scheme 3 are known compounds and can be obtained as commercial products. In the first step a -methylbenzylamine is reacted with 2-bromoethanol to produce N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rt-mcthylbenzylamine, which in turn is reacted with the brominating agent to produce N-(2-bromoethyf)- a - methylbenzylamine hydrobromide. In the third step, N-(2-bromrtethyl)- -methylbenzylamine hydrobromide is reacted with a Lewis acid to produce the desired 1-methyl -l,2,3,4-tetrahydroiso-ciuinoline of formula (III).<br>
Reaction solvents which can be used in the first step include acetonitrile, N.N-dimechylforroamide, dichloromethane and 1,2-dichlorn-ethane and the reaction temperature is preferably maintained in the range from 401C to 601. Reaction solvents which can be used in the second step include 1,2-dichloroethane, acetic add, water and 1,2-dichloro-benzene, and the reaction temperature is preferably maintained in the range from 110ºC to 145ºC. Brominating agents which can be used in this reaction include bromine, bromic aicd, aqueous bromic acid solution, and phosphorus trihrnmide.<br>
Although the first and second steps of the reaction scheme 3 can<br>
the desired 1 -methyl- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline of formula (Til). Reaction solvents which can be used in this reaction include decalin, 1,2-dichIoroethane and 1,2-dichlorobenzene and Lewis acids for this cyclization reaction include aluminum (HI) chloride, zinc chloride and ferrous chloride.<br>
Since I -methyl- 1,2,3,4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline can be economically prepared   according   to   the   above   method,   the   desired   5,6-dimethyl -2-(4-nuorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-y1) -pyrimidine of formula (I) according to the present invention can also be economically prepared using this compound as the reactant.<br>
In order to use the compound of formula (III) in the form of (R)-(-O- or (S)-(-)isomer as the starting material for preparation of the compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, each isomeric form of the compound of formula (HI) can be efficiently prepared using the corresponding (R)-(+)- or (S)-(-)-methylbenzylamine as the starting material used in the method depicted in the reaction scheme 3.<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in detail by the following examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is not in any manner limited by these examples.<br>
