				<td>Fully-metal heat exchanger and method for its production<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a fully-metal heat<br>
exchanger, composed of flat tubes having two narrow and two<br>
wide sides and of fins which, together with the flat tubes,<br>
form a block, and which fully-metal heat exchanger has either<br>
at least one tube base and a collecting tank, with edges of<br>
the collecting tank being connected, for example soldered, to<br>
edges of the tube base, or at least one collecting tank which<br>
contains the tube base, and having projections which are<br>
arranged at intervals. The invention also relates to a<br>
production method for heat exchangers.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The heat exchanger described above is known, for<br>
example, from DE 198 19 247 A1. The projections therein<br>
correspond to openings in the tube bases. In this way, it is<br>
provided that the individual parts are provisionally held<br>
together before the soldering process is carried out. The<br>
expenditure for auxiliary soldering aids can be considerably<br>
reduced. A certain disadvantage of the known heat exchanger<br>
is that the tube base still protrudes a considerable distance<br>
beyond the fin/flat-tube block, which could be considered to<br>
be an unnecessary spatial requirement. In addition, the ratio<br>
of the cross sections taken up by the flat tubes in relation<br>
to the overall cross section of the heat exchanger or of its<br>
2<br><br>
tube bases is not optimal, so that improvements are possible<br>
with regard to an efficient heat exchanger.<br>
ILLUSTRATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is that of providing a<br>
heat exchanger which, while providing comparatively good<br>
thermotechnical values, has a low spatial requirement.<br>
It is possible as a side effect to expect a<br>
production-friendly, in particular also flexible design.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention<br>
with regard to the fully-metal heat exchanger by using the<br>
features of claim 1. The production method according to the<br>
invention is the subject matter of claim 22. It is provided<br>
that the projections engage in the region of the narrow sides<br>
into the ends of the flat tubes. The projections are<br>
preferably situated at the opposite longitudinal edges of the<br>
collecting tank.<br>
Preferably means in this case that embodiments may be<br>
provided in which the projections are arranged at the<br>
longitudinal edges of the tube base, possibly associated with<br>
the disadvantage that the tube bases become more complex and<br>
some other advantages are not provided. Another possible<br>
design is to provide a metallic, frame-like additional part<br>
which has the projections.<br>
The production method leads to several advantages.<br>
3<br><br>
The projections, which are inserted into the flat tube ends,<br>
at the two opposite edges of the collecting tank hold the<br>
flat- tubes under tension during the subsequent soldering<br>
process, so that the risk of a so-called "falling in" of the<br>
flat tubes, with the result of inadequate soldered<br>
connections to the tube base, is significantly reduced. The<br>
invention therefore also permits the use of flat tubes whose<br>
wide sides can have relatively large dimensions, and<br>
accordingly avoids the use, which is complex in production<br>
terms, of a plurality of flat tube rows in the direction of<br>
the depth of the flat-tube/fin block. In other words, it is<br>
possible by means of the invention to provide heat exchangers<br>
over a significantly wider power spectrum with significantly<br>
less variation expenditure.<br>
In addition, the abovementioned advantages of the<br>
prior art are maintained, that is to say in particular the<br>
expenditure for auxiliary soldering aids is considerably<br>
reduced, since the inserted projections assist in holding<br>
together the assembled individual parts of the heat<br>
exchanger.<br>
Because the flat tubes extend over the entire depth<br>
of the tube base - and preferably even beyond this - there is<br>
practically no space which would not be available for the<br>
purpose of heat transfer. In other words, that cross-<br>
sectional area of the flat tubes through which flow passes is<br>
in a favorable ratio to the entire area covered by the tube<br>
4<br><br>
base, which is in turn approximately the same as the area in<br>
this regard which is covered by the entire heat exchanger.<br>
In addition, the proposed ,heat exchanger has a higher<br>
degree of process reliability during production than heat<br>
exchangers which do not have tube bases but have, instead of<br>
the tube bases, widened flat tube ends, as are known for<br>
example from DE 195 43 986 A1 or from even much earlier<br>
documents.<br>
It is the case either that the flat tubes protrude<br>
with their narrow sides beyond the width of the tube base,<br>
and in the protruding region, the projections engage into the<br>
ends of the flat tubes, or that the tube base width protrudes<br>
beyond the narrow sides of the flat tubes, and in the<br>
protruding region, the projections engage into the ends of<br>
the flat tubes.<br>
The first of said alternatives is, as mentioned,<br>
preferable, because it better prevents the previously<br>
mentioned "falling in" of the flat tubes, since in this case<br>
the edge of the collecting tanks with the projections bear<br>
from the outside against the edge of the tube base, and<br>
because, as a result, the projections are particularly<br>
resistant to forces which act in the direction of the wide<br>
side, that is to say transversely with respect to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the flat tubes. In addition, said<br>
alternative also appears to be more favorable with regard to<br>
producing sealed connections.<br>
5<br><br>
The projections in each case make contact with the<br>
narrow sides of the flat tubes from the inside, and are<br>
preferably soldered there.<br>
The tube base preferably has edges, which are bent in<br>
a way known per se, and openings for receiving in each case<br>
one flat tube end. According to the proposal, however, the<br>
openings extend into the bent edges.<br>
The tube bases have edges bent only at the two<br>
longitudinal sides, so that said tube bases, can be produced<br>
from one sheet-metal strip of any desired length. The tooling<br>
costs for changing over to different heat exchanger sizes are<br>
considerably reduced as a result.<br>
The collecting tank has end-side openings. Each<br>
collecting tank is therefore constituted by only one metal<br>
sheet with two bends, which is likewise advantageous in<br>
production terms.<br>
The end-side openings of the collecting tank are<br>
closed off by means of side parts, which are known per se,<br>
which extend over the length of the flat tubes.<br>
The projections are expediently shaped in such a way<br>
as to assist their insertion into the ends of the flat tubes.<br>
One advantageous refinement provides forming the projections<br>
in the manner of incisors. Said design makes it possible to<br>
better compensate length tolerances in the flat tubes.<br>
Despite the unavoidable length tolerances, it is possible to<br>
produce sealed connections between the projections and the<br>
6<br><br>
flat tube ends.<br>
The fully-metal heat exchanger can, in the widest<br>
sense, be used to ,advantage anywhere where there is a<br>
requirement for good heat transfer efficiency with a<br>
simultaneously low spatial requirement. The inventor<br>
envisages using heat exchangers of said type specifically as<br>
air-cooled charge-air coolers in motor vehicles, but without<br>
thereby excluding any other possible application, especially<br>
in the field of motor vehicles.<br>
A fully-metal heat exchanger should be a heat<br>
exchanger whose constituent parts, which are specified in the<br>
claims, are composed of metal, preferably of aluminum,<br>
regardless of whether or not other, non-metal parts which<br>
could belong to the system are subsequently fastened to said<br>
heat exchanger. For example, comparatively complex<br>
accessories are to be attached and securely fastened to<br>
fully-metal heat exchangers which are produced from shaped<br>
metal sheets.<br>
The projections, which are provided on a comb-like<br>
additional part such as a sheet metal strip or the like which<br>
is connected to the wall of the collecting tank, which sit in<br>
the flat tube ends hold the flat tubes under tension during<br>
the subsequent soldering process, so that the risk of the<br>
abovementioned "falling in" of the flat tubes, with the<br>
result of inadequate soldered connections in the receiving<br>
openings, is also significantly reduced by the provision of<br>
7<br><br>
the additional part. In addition, the advantages of the prior<br>
art are maintained, that is to say in particular the<br>
expenditure for auxiliary soldering aids is considerably<br>
reduced, since the strips (additional parts) have hooks on<br>
the ends which assist in holding the assembled individual<br>
parts of the heat exchanger together by engaging over the<br>
side parts.<br>
The collecting tanks can be of single-part or multi-<br>
part design. A prominent feature is a part which has a U-<br>
shaped cross section, with the base section being provided<br>
with receiving openings for the tube ends, and the two limbs<br>
forming the two walls of the collecting tank. If the walls<br>
are shaped and joined together to form a space, then single-<br>
part collecting tanks are formed. If the walls remain<br>
substantially planar, a second part is required for forming<br>
the closed space, resulting then in two-part collecting tanks<br>
being formed. The receiving openings extend at least into the<br>
walls of the collecting tank.<br>
Said projections are also expediently shaped so as to<br>
assist their insertion into the ends of the flat tubes.<br>
The additional part is a chamber-like sheet-metal<br>
strip which in shaping terms is easy to process in order to<br>
form the additional part. Within the context of the present<br>
invention, the term "strip" encompasses all possible physical<br>
embodiments, so that an additional part can be generally<br>
referred to thereby. Said projections on the strip or<br>
8<br><br>
additional parts can be first projections for the case that<br>
second projections are provided on the strip. The second<br>
projections are then arranged between the first projections.<br>
The second projections improve the assembly or the<br>
preparation of the heat exchanger for the following soldering<br>
process.<br>
The method according to the invention for producing a<br>
fully-metal heat exchanger, with flat tubes and fins being<br>
placed together to form a flat-tube/fin block, whereafter<br>
tube bases are placed on the ends of the flat tubes and<br>
finally collecting tanks are placed with their edges on the<br>
edges of the tube bases, is characterized in that projections<br>
which are arranged on a component are inserted, in the region<br>
of the narrow sides of the flat tubes, into the ends thereof.<br>
The longitudinal edges of the collecting tank<br>
preferably bear against the longitudinal edges of the tube<br>
base from the outside. The narrow sides of the flat tubes<br>
protrude beyond the longitudinal edges, so that projections<br>
situated at the longitudinal edges of the collecting tank can<br>
be inserted into the protruding flat tube regions. In this<br>
way, the projections hold the flat tubes in a tensioned<br>
state.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
A1l of the illustrated individual parts of the heat<br>
exchanger are composed of metal, preferably of aluminum or<br>
aluminum alloys, which is expediently coated with a solder<br>
layer. The individual parts, such as flat tubes 1, fins 4,<br>
tube bases 5, collecting tanks 6 and side parts 30, are<br>
produced from metal sheets, though it is not excluded that<br>
for example the flat tubes 1 could also be produced as drawn<br>
10 <br><br>
tubes. The flat tubes 1 have an approximately rectangular<br>
cross section, it however being possible for the narrow sides<br>
2 to also be arched outward slightly. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the inner inserts are situated in the flat tubes 1.<br>
The flat tubes 1 are then stacked with fins 4 in order to<br>
form a flat-tube/fin block. Tube bases 5 are placed on the<br>
ends of the flat tubes 1, with the ends of the flat tubes 1<br>
being situated in openings 21 of the tube bases 5, where a<br>
sealed soldered connection is later formed. The collecting<br>
tanks 6 are then placed on, specifically, as can be seen in<br>
particular from figure 4, with the projections 11 at the<br>
edges 10 of the collecting tanks 6 thereby being inserted<br>
into those edge regions of the flat tubes 1 which are formed<br>
by the narrow sides 2, which protrude slightly beyond the<br>
edges 20 of the tube base 5, of the flat tubes 1. Preferably<br>
situated at the edge of the openings 21 in the tube bases 5<br>
are rim holes (not illustrated) which preferably point away<br>
from the collecting tank 6, so that the flat tube ends do not<br>
protrude inward in order to ensure a low loss of pressure of<br>
the medium flowing into the flat tubes 1. Webs 22 are<br>
provided between the openings 21 in the tube bases 5. The<br>
webs 22 can be of profiled design in order to increase their<br>
stiffness. Finally, the side parts 30 are placed on, which<br>
side parts 30 at the same time close off the end-side<br>
openings 60 of the collecting tanks 6. For this purpose, the<br>
side parts 30 have, at their ends, in each case one cup-<br>
11<br><br>
shaped closure piece which fits into the opening 60. The side<br>
parts 30 are provisionally fixed, and hold the individual<br>
parts of the heat exchanger together, by means of deformable<br>
retaining elements 61 which engage into a slot 62 of the side<br>
parts. In said form, the heat exchanger is substantially<br>
prepared for carrying out the CAB hard soldering process. A1l<br>
the connections are produced in one working operation in the<br>
soldering furnace.<br>
The shape of the projections 11 is expediently<br>
matched to the contour of the flat tubes 1 which is provided<br>
in the region of the narrow sides 2, so that both the<br>
insertion is facilitated and also sealed soldered connections<br>
are provided. Certain production tolerances are also absorbed<br>
in this way. The spacing of the projections 11 at the edge of<br>
the collecting tanks 6 corresponds to the spacing of the flat<br>
tubes 1 in the row or with the height of the fins 4 arranged<br>
between the flat tubes 1. Here, certain tolerances must be<br>
permissible which can however be compensated by the expedient<br>
shape of the projections 11 (see the description of figures<br>
15 and 16 further below).<br>
The collecting tanks 6 are of particularly<br>
production-friendly, simple configuration. Only two bends are<br>
necessary in order to form the two longitudinal walls and a<br>
transverse wall. Connecting pipes 70, for example, can be<br>
easily produced by means of shaping processes.<br>
Particularly production-friendly tube bases 5 are<br>
12<br><br>
also to be used, which are manufactured from endless band and<br>
need merely be cut to the appropriate length, because said<br>
tube bases do not have any bent edges at their end sides.<br>
Accordingly, no expensive drawing tools are required. It is<br>
expedient to make reference here to figures 4 and 5. It can<br>
be seen in said figures that a lug 100, which is comparable<br>
to the projections 11, is provided at the edge 10 of the<br>
collecting tank 6. Said lug 100 interacts with the<br>
corresponding cut-out 101 at the edge 20 of the tube base 5<br>
and ensures sealed soldered connections there. It can also be<br>
seen from figure 5 that the openings 21 in the tube base 5<br>
extend into the edge 20, as indicated by the reference symbol<br>
22. The tube bases 5 can therefore, during assembly, also be<br>
pushed transversely with respect to their longitudinal<br>
direction, or in the direction of the wide sides 3 of the<br>
flat tube ends, onto said flat tube ends. In the prior art, a<br>
movement in the longitudinal direction of the flat tubes is<br>
required for this purpose. This is referred to as "drawing<br>
on" the tube bases.<br>
Figures 3 and 6 in particular show, in a view of one<br>
of the side parts 30, that there are no lateral protrusions<br>
of the tube bases 5 beyond the flat-tube/fin block. The width<br>
of the side parts 30 corresponds approximately to the<br>
dimension of the wide sides 3 of the flat tubes 1.<br>
It is also to be pointed out that the heat exchanger<br>
13<br><br>
according to the invention permits relatively easy access<br>
from the outside to connections which are critical in<br>
soldering terms. Critical connections of said type are the<br>
flat-tube/tube-base connections. Should leakages be present<br>
there after the soldering process is carried out, the<br>
corresponding points can, by virtue of being largely<br>
accessible, be easily aftertreated and eliminated in a second<br>
soldering process. In heat exchangers of the prior art, it is<br>
often not possible to do this, resulting in high rejection<br>
rates.<br>
Figure 7 schematically shows one individual flat tube<br>
1, specifically in a view of the flat tube end. Flat tubes 1<br>
of said type are provided in desired numbers in the heat<br>
exchanger. Two projections 11 extend into each flat tube 1.<br>
The penetration depth need only be a few millimeters; 10-15<br>
mm is more than enough. It would practically be even less. It<br>
is self-evident that the one projection 11 is situated on the<br>
one edge of the collecting tank 6 and the other projection 11<br>
is situated on the opposite, other edge 10 of the collecting<br>
tank 6. The projections 11 bear tightly from the inside<br>
against the narrow sides 2 of the flat tubes 1. Situated in<br>
the flat tubes 1 is an inner insert 80, as is typical in<br>
particular for charge air coolers which are impinged on by<br>
cooling air. In other applications, an inner insert is<br>
dispensed with entirely. It is practically often difficult to<br>
insert the inner inserts 80 into the flat tubes 1 in such a<br>
14<br><br>
way that the least possible bypass is generated in the region<br>
of the narrow sides 2 for the charge air flowing through,<br>
which has an adverse effect on the heat transfer. As shown in<br>
Figure 7, the projections 11 have a favorable effect on the<br>
reduction of the disadvantageous bypass, which is a further<br>
advantage of the invention. The small gaps in the corners of<br>
the flat tubes 1 are caused by the illustration. They are in<br>
practice not present or are securely closed off in the<br>
soldering process. Said gaps will also level out as the<br>
projections 11 are inserted, since the projections 11 hold<br>
the two wide sides 3 under a certain tension in the direction<br>
of the arrow.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 now show an alternative design in<br>
which the projections 11 are arranged on the tube bases 5. In<br>
said case, the tube bases 5 must be drawn on in the tube<br>
longitudinal direction, with the projections 11<br>
simultaneously being inserted into the flat tube ends 1.<br>
Thereafter, the collecting tanks 6 and the side parts 30 are<br>
placed on and mounted.<br>
Single-part collecting tanks 6 have been provided at<br>
least in the exemplary embodiment which is shown in figures<br>
10-14. It is however provided in any case that the collecting<br>
tanks 6 also comprise the tube bases 5, so that therefore no<br>
classic tube bases are provided as separate parts, as can be<br>
gathered from said figures. The collecting tank 6 has a base<br>
section 106 from which extend two bent walls 107 of the<br>
15 <br><br>
collecting tank 6. The walls 107 are shaped and can be<br>
connected by means of a longitudinal weld seam (not shown) in<br>
order to form the collecting tank 6. Provided in the base<br>
section 106 are receiving openings 21 for the flat tube ends,<br>
wherein the spacings of the flat tubes 1 should accordingly<br>
correspond to the spacings of the receiving openings 21. A<br>
very prominent feature is that the receiving openings 21<br>
extend into the walls 107, that is to say they extend<br>
slightly beyond the bent edge of the walls 107 on the base<br>
section 106, as can be seen sufficiently clearly from Figure<br>
14 at reference symbol 22. In the exemplary embodiments<br>
shown, in each case one strip (additional part) 110 is<br>
situated on all the walls 107 of the two collecting tanks 6.<br>
At the walls 107 of the one collecting tank 6, the strips 110<br>
have been formed with additional functions such as for<br>
example with retaining functions 90 for accessories (not<br>
illustrated). It is not strictly necessary to provide strips<br>
110 on all the walls 107. It is advantageous to provide a<br>
trip 110 in particular whenever additional functions 70 are<br>
to be carried out. In the present exemplary embodiment, it<br>
would be fundamentally entirely possible to dispense with<br>
those narrow strips 110 at the walls 107 of the left-hand<br>
collecting tank 6 which do not provide any additional<br>
function, and for this purpose to provide there the solution<br>
described above, that is to say, there, the projections 11<br>
would be arranged directly on the walls 107 of the collecting<br>
16<br><br>
tank 6, and tube bases would be provided as individual parts,<br>
as shown in the figures.<br>
A further advantage of the strip 110 can be gathered<br>
from Figure 12. It can be seen in said figure that the strip<br>
110, which is formed with the stated additional functions,<br>
can also contribute to the strength of the collecting tank 6.<br>
It can be seen in Figure 12 that the strip 110 extends over a<br>
considerable part of the wall 107 of the collecting tank and<br>
is soldered to said wall 107.<br>
It is possible from Figures 13 and 14 to more clearly<br>
see the design of the strip 110 with regard to the<br>
projections 11 which are arranged thereon at intervals. The<br>
projections 11 can be provided with a contour which serves to<br>
facilitate the sliding of said projections 11 into the flat<br>
tubes 1. Between the projections 11, which are first<br>
projections 11, are situated in each case second projections<br>
12. As can be seen, in each case one second projection 12 has<br>
been arranged between two first projections 11. The second<br>
projections 12 cause a counteracting moment of the strip 110<br>
which could otherwise, when the first projections 11 are<br>
situated in the flat tube ends, seek to stick out away from<br>
the wall 107, which is undesirable. Since the second<br>
projections 12 bear in each case against the fins 4 from the<br>
outside, this is prevented or at least counteracted.<br>
It can also be seen from Figures 13 and 14 that it is<br>
17<br><br>
advantageous to form a hook 13 at the ends of the strip 110,<br>
which hook 13 is suitable to fixedly hold the side part 30<br>
against the outer fin 4. This assists in holding the entire<br>
heat exchanger together before soldering. In addition, this<br>
also suppresses the abovementioned "sticking out" of the<br>
strip 110 from the wall 107. In addition, it is also possible<br>
in this way to dispense with the brackets, shown in Figure 1<br>
at positions 61 and 62, which are intended to retain the side<br>
parts 30 in the end-side openings 60 of the collecting tank<br>
6, which is also advantageous in production terms.<br>
Figure 15 shows a detail with only one projection 11.<br>
The projections 11 have been designed in the manner of<br>
incisors 111. Length tolerances in the flat tubes which are<br>
in the range from +/- 1.0 mm can be better absorbed in this<br>
way. Sharp edges 112 have been formed on said projections 11,<br>
which sharp edges 112 also extend in the radii, that is to<br>
say in the region of the transition from the projection 11<br>
into the wall of the collecting tank 6 or of the additional<br>
part or of the tube base. As the projections 11 are inserted<br>
into the flat tube ends, the sharp edges 112 cut said ends of<br>
those flat tubes which are in the upper length tolerance<br>
range open slightly and "crumple" said ends around slightly.<br>
This can be clearly seen in Figure 16 at k. The central tube<br>
there is slightly longer than the two other tubes. The sharp<br>
edge of the projection 11 is produced for example by means of<br>
cold shaping. The thickness difference between the<br>
18<br><br>
projections 11 and the wall of the flat tubes assists said<br>
process. The wall of the collecting tank 6, from which the<br>
projections 11 are for example formed, can be approximately<br>
1.0 - 2.0 mm thick, while the thickness of the wall of the<br>
flat tubes can be in the range from 0.05 - 0.25 mm.<br>
Overall, the invention accordingly provides an<br>
innovative product which, compared to the prior art, leaves<br>
little to be desired.<br>
