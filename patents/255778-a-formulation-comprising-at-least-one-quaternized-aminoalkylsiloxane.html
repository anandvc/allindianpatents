				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   a   formulation   comprising   at   least   one   quaternized aminoalkylsiloxane.<br>
The invention relates to novel formulations based on quaternized aminoalkylsilicones or -siloxanes, to processes for preparing these formulations and to their use as textile assistants for finishing textile materials.<br>
Silicone softeners are used widely for the finishing of textile materials. For the practical use of the silicone softener emulsions, requirements such as storage stability, thermal stability, resistance toward whiteners and other anionic textile assistants, resistance to pH changes and salt addition and against the action of mechanical energy are of central significance. Particularly the stability against the action of mechanical energy, the shear stability or jet stability, often presents silicone softener emulsions with great difficulties under industrial conditions (cf. R. Zyschka, Melhand Textilberichte 6/2001, 497).<br>
Microemulsions offer the fundamental advantage of thermodynamic stability. In a multitude of publications, the equilibrium phase behavior is treated as a function of the. structure of the oil to be emulsified and/or of the surfactant(s). Likewise systematically studied has been the addition of inorganic salts (cf. M. Kahlweit et al., Langmurr 11[1995], 3382; M. Kahlweit et al., Langmuir 11[1995]). The equilibrium , phase behavior of microemulsions of low molecular weight silicones has likewise been investigated (EP-A. 774482; H. von Berlepsch et al, Progr. Colloid Polymer Science 111[1998], 107).<br>
With regard to' the softening components, combinations of hydrocarbon-based quats with silicone quats (GB-A 1549180) or else silicone polyethers with silicone quats (US-A 4921895) have been proposed.<br>
To improve the hydrophilicity, the widely utilized ammoalkylsiloxanes are increasingly being replaced by polyether-modified ammoalkylsiloxane oils (cf EP-A 578144)<br>
An additional introduction of alkoxysilyl structures into polyether- and ammo-substituted silicones has likewise been proposed (US-A 20020028900)<br>
Finally, true permanently hydrophilic textile softeners based on silicone quats have been disclosed in WO 02/10256, WO 02/10257 and WO 02/10259.<br>
Fine microemulsions of ammoalkylsiloxanes are said to be obtainable m a two-stage process by preparing a concentrate of ammoalkylsiloxane, silicone-insoluble surfactant and a little water with subsequent rapid stirring into water (US-A 4620878)<br>
According  to  DE-A  3723697,   aminosiloxane  emulsions   are   said  to  become mechanically stable as a result of the use of water-soluble nomonogenic emulsifiers For extreme shear stresses, as are achieved on modem jet plants, it has been found that the inventions disclosed m DE-A 3723697 are insufficient to prevent deposits m the jet plant and on the textiles to be treated.<br>
According to WO 02/10501, ammo functional organosihcon compounds are said to become mechanically stable even m jet dyeing machines without using water-soluble nomonogenic emulsifiers It has been found that the inventions disclosed in WO 02/10501 are likewise not yet sufficient to reliably prevent deposits on differently pretreated textiles.<br>
Mechanical stability of aminosiloxane microemulsions is also said to be achievable by using betaines, optionally m combination with nomonogemc surfactants of the HLB range from 5 to 16 (cf. US-A 5573694, US-A 5520827)<br>
It is known in dyeing technology that complex mixtures which comprise sulfonated alkylnaphthyl derivatives and halogenated hydrocarbons can be utilized as jet-stable dyeing accelerator formulations (US-A 4080166)<br>
Such sulfonated naphthyl derivatives in combination with fatty alcohol ethoxylates have also been proposed for the stabilization of mkjetable formulations (US-A 6302948). The combination of fatty alcohol ethoxylates with pigments of a certain size is likewise said to lead to mkjetable systems (US-A 6099627)<br>
Finally, it is also known that salts of strong acids, e g. Al2(SO4)3 x 18 H2O ensure protonation of catiomc dyes m thermal transfer printing pastes but simultaneously impair their stability (cf US-A 5925701).<br>
It is common to all of the proposals cited that they do not contain any hints to measures by which emulsions or microemulsions of sihcone-based textile softeners, preferably ammosiloxanes and quatemized ammoalkylsiloxanes (sihcone quats) can be stabilized reliably against the action of high mechanical energy input of the modern jet systems m combination with greatly varying liquor ratios and the influence of varying pretreatment preparations on the fibers Moreover, the prior art does not disclose any measures by which the simultaneously occurring high foaming tendency (causes stain formation) of textile softener formulations under high mechanical energy input can be restricted<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to describe measures by which emulsions or microemulsions of silicon-based textile softeners, preferably quatemized ammoalkylsiloxanes (silicone quats), can be reliably stabilized under the action of high energy input (extremely high shear forces m modern jet systems) in combination with greatly varying liquor ratios, and the influence of varying pretreatment preparations and the foaming tendency can be simultaneously restricted<br>
It has been found that, surprisingly, this object is achieved by the combination of quatemized ammoalkylsiloxanes with highly hydrophihc nomonogemc interface-active compounds (surfactants) and/or highly hydrophihc dispersants and/or salts of polyvalent cations and optionally further customary formulation agents.<br>
The present mvention therefore relates to formulations comprising at least one quatemized armnoalkylsiloxane and at least one compound from the group of<br>
a)	the hydrophihc, nonionogenic, interface-active compounds,<br>
b)	the hydrophihc dispersants and<br>
c)	the salts of di- or tnvalent metals with inorganic acids<br>
Preferred hydrophihc, nomonogemc, interface-active compounds (a) m the context of the invention are substances which lower the surface tension of water to below 45 mN/m. They are in particular compounds modified with ethylene/propylene oxide (EO/PO), optionally unsaturated and/or branched, from the group of the fatty alcohols, fatty acids, alcohols, acids, alkylaryl derivatives, fatty amines, glycendes and sorbitan esters, in each of which the number of EO/PO units is between 15 and 150, the ratio of PO units to EO units being equal to 0 25 or lower than 0 25, and m each of which the number of ethylene oxide umts (EO fraction) is greater than or equal to the number of carbon atoms m the non-EO fraction, or are alkyl-polyglycosides, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers and polyethersiloxanes.<br>
Hydrophihc dispersants (b) in the context of the invention are substances which, when added to water, lower the surface tension to a value between 72 to 45 mN/m<br>
The preferred compounds (b) are water-soluble polysaccharides such as carboxy-methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylhydroxypropylcellulose or compounds of the formula<br>

The counterions are to be selected m such a way that sufficient water and formulation solubility is ensured at a given stability of the salt.

The inventive formulations in some cases also comprise any mixtures of the above-designated quatemized armnoalkylsiloxane compounds with the corresponding nonquaternized compounds In these nonquatermzed compounds, m each case one of the Rn or R12 radicals or R13 or R14 radicals m the mam chain on the nitrogen atoms in the formula (10) is thus absent<br>
The quatemized armnoalkylsiloxane compounds which are preferred in accordance with the invention form part of the subject-matter of WO 02/10 259 and are described there generally and specifically The contents of WO 02/10 259 are incorporated fully by the present application.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the amounts of hydrophihc, nonionogenic, interface-active compounds (a) and/or hydrophihc dispersants (b) and/or salts (c) to the amounts of quatemized armnoalkylsiloxane compounds are m a weight ratio n of Ω = 0 05 to 10, preferably Ω = 0 05 to 5, especially Ω = 0 05 to 3, very especially Ω = 0 05 to 1 Ω. illustrates only the ratio of total amount of component (a) to (c) to amount of silicone quat. When the amounts of additive (a) and/or (b) and/or (c) are too small, the effective stabilization m the fiber finishing is<br><br>
always be maintained under strong mechanical shear, high temperatures, long finishing cycles Very large additive amounts are uneconomic and can change the hand of the textile m an undesired manner<br>
The additives a) to c) described may be added in two ways It is possible firstly to introduce the inventive additives directly into the formulations. Secondly, it may be favorable under practice conditions to first dilute the formulations to use concentration and to subsequently add the inventive additives to the liquor prepared<br>
In addition to components (a) and/or (b) and/or (c), the inventive formulations may also comprise further interface-active components (f) which enable emulsification or microemulsification<br>
These components (f) are customary formulation agents, known to those skilled m the art, for preparing the silicone (micro)emulsions which, however, alone are not stable against high energy input Such preferred components fl) to f6) include- (fl) oxalkylation products which are obtainable by alkoxylating, with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, condensation products of phenolic OH-contammg aromatics with formaldehyde and NH functional groups. f2) nonionic or lomcally modified compounds from the group of the alkoxylates, alkylolamides, esters, amine oxides and alkylpolyglycosides, especially reaction products of alkylene oxides with alkylatable compounds, for example fatty alcohols, fatty amines, fatty acids, phenols, alkylphenols, carboxamides and resin acids They are, for example, ethylene oxide ethers from the class of the reaction products of ethylene oxide with saturated and/or unsaturated fatty alcohols having from 6 to 25 carbon atoms (commercially available, for example, m the form of Renex® product series) or alkylphenols having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms m the alkyl radical or saturated and/or unsaturated fatty amines having from 14 to 20 carbon atoms or saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids having from 14 to 22 carbon atoms, or estenfication and/or arylation products which are prepared from natural or modified, optionally hydrogenated castor oil fatty substances and are optionally joined to give repeating units by estenfication with<br>
dicarboxylic acids f3) ionic or noniomc compounds from the group of the reaction products of alkylene oxide with sorbitan esters [Tween, ICI], oxalkylated acety-lenediols and glycols, oxalkylated phenols, especially phenol/styrene polyglycol ethers f4) ionic or noniomc polymeric surface-active agents from the group of the homo- and copolymers, graft polymers and graft copolymers and random and linear block copolymers. f5) anionic surface-active agents, for example alkyl sulfates, ether sulfates, ether carboxylates, phosphate esters, sulfosuccmamides, paraffin sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, sarcosmates, isothionates and taurates f6) amphoteric surface-active agents such as betames and ampholytes especially glycmates, propionates and imidazolines<br>
Particularly preferred formulation constituents (f) are alkoxylated fatty alcohols, branched fatty alcohols and fatty acids having from 4 to 14 alkoxy units, very particularly preferred formulation constituents (f) are alkoxylated fatty alcohols, branched fatty alcohols havmg from 6 to 12 alkoxyl units, especially formulations which contain the ether of tndecyl alcohol with 12 mol of EO, the ether of tndecyl alcohol with 6 mol of EO.<br>
The formulation constituents are generally added m customary amounts to the inventive formulation. Preference is given to adding the components (f) m amounts of from 1 to 200% by weight, preferably from 10 to 80% by weight, more preferably 10-50% by weight, based on the quatemized ammoalkylsiloxane<br>
In addition to component(s) (a) to (c), the formulations, m each case alone or m combination, and the additives (f) may also compnse further assistants in the amounts customary for these assistants<br>
Typical assistants m the context of the invention include leveling agents, wetting agents, lustenng agents, fiber protection agents, antislip agents and further prior art assistants A good overview of the inventive assistants can be found in Chwala/ Anger, Handbuch der Textilhilfsmittel. Verlag Chemie, Wemhem  1977<br>
Furthermore, buffer systems may be used to obtain an optimal pH value during the finishing<br>
To prepare the inventive formulations, the quatemized ammoalkylsiloxane compounds may be mixed with components (a), (b) and/or (c), optionally with addition of further, abovementioned constituents, preferably within a temperature range of from 20 to 90°C, more preferably of from 25 to 70°C, most preferably from 30 to 60°C<br>
The quatemized aminoalkylsiloxanes are preferably added to the compound(s) (a), (b) and/or (c), particular preference is given to initially charging the quatemized ammoalkylsiloxane (silicone quat) and completing the emulsion formulation by adding the compound(s) (a), (b) and/or (c) and optionally further additives<br>
The inventive formulations are outstandingly suitable as textile softeners in the finishing of textile structures, especially those made of cotton, keratin fibers, preferably wool, silk or synthetic fibers or, for example, used very efficiently for the finishing of textile structures made of mixtures of cotton with polyester, polyamide, polyacrylonitnle, wool or silk. Excellent results are equally achieved m the finishing of textile structures made of synthetic fibers, especially made of polyester, polyamide, polypropylene or mixtures thereof<br>
Textile structures are preferably wovens, knits, including formed-loop knits, and nonwovens<br>
It has been found that the inventive formulations are particularly advantageous for the finishing of cotton or cotton-contammg textiles which have been pretreated with anionic hghteners by the jet process<br>
When the inventive formulations are used, it is possible not only to achieve outstanding softener results but also an improvement in other properties of the textile such as the solubility or an increase m the gloss<br>
The finishing is generally effected by the continuous process (pad mangle or backwasher process) or by the exhaustion process (jet process). When the inventive formulations are employed by one of these finishing processes, it has been found to be advantageous to maintain the following technological parameters<br>
•	Continuous (for example pad mangle, backwasher)<br>

Examples<br>
In the formulations which follow, a silicone quat (SΩ) synthesized according to WO 02/10259, Example 1, was used which had the following structural elements and is prepared as follows<br>
la) A 1 liter three-neck flask was initially charged at room temperature with 24 g of water and 4.18 g (0 048 mol of tertiary ammo groups) of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1.6-hexanediamme and 3 8 g (0 012 mol of primary ammo groups) of an alkylene oxide derivative, obtainable under the trade name Jeffamin® ED 600, of the structure<br>
H2NCH(CH3)CH2[OCH2CH(CH3)]a(OCH2CH2)9[OCH2CH(CH3)]bNH2 where a+b = 36<br>
Within 5 minutes, 12 0 g (0.03 mol) of dodecanoic acid in the form of a 50% solution m 2-propanol and 1.8 g (0.03 mol) of acetic acid were added. After the mixture had been heated to 50°C, 194.1 g (0 06 mol of epoxy groups) of an epoxy siloxane of the average composition<br>

and 30 ml of 2-propanol were added dropwise within 30 minutes The yellow, opaque mixture was heated to reflux temperature for 6 hours After removal of all constituents volatile up to 100°C and at a reduced pressure of 2 mmHg, 204 g of a slightly yellow, opaque material were obtained which contains the following structural elements<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Startmg  from  this  silicone  material,   three  microemulsion  concentrates  of the following composition were prepared<br>

Experiment 1 describes the unacceptable result of a nonmventive prior art experiment. Doubling of the amount of both Renex surfactants does not lead to prevention of deposits (Experiment 2, noninventive)<br>
Expenments 3 and 4 demonstrate that an inventive addition of salts of polyvalent cations can reliably prevent deposits Aluminum salts are more effective than magnesium compounds<br>
Expenment 5 shows that an inventive incorporation of hydrophihc interface-active compounds directly into the formulation reliably prevents deposits It is also true of a likewise inventive partial subsequent addition (Expenment 6) or inventive full addition (Expenment 7) of this hydrophihc interface-active compound<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
