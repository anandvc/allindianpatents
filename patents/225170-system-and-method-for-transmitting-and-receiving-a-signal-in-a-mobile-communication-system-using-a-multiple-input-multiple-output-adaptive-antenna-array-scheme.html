				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING A<br>
SIGNAL IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING A<br>
MULTIPLE INPUT MULTIPLE OUTPUT ADAPTIVE ANTENNA ARRAY<br>
SCHEME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication<br>
system, and more particularly to a system and a method for transmitting and<br>
receiving data in a mobile communication system using a multiple input multiple<br>
output adaptive antenna array scheme.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Packet service communication systems, which are used to transmit burst<br>
packet data to a plurality of mobile stations, have been developed as next-<br>
generation mobile communication systems and are designed with the capabilities<br>
for transmitting mass storage data.<br>
Recently, a number of packet service communication systems are being<br>
developed in order to provide a high-speed packet service. The 3GGP (3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project), which is a consortium established for providing<br>
asynchronous telecommunication standards, has suggested a high-speed downlink<br>
packet access (HSDPA) scheme for providing the high-speed packet service. In<br>
addition, the 3GGP2 (3rd Generation Partnership Project2), which is a consortium<br>
established for providing synchronous telecommunication standards, has<br>
suggested a 1x EV-DO/V (1x Evolution Data Only/Voice) scheme for providing<br>
the high-speed packet service.<br>
Both HSDPA and lx EV-DO/V schemes suggest the high-speed packet<br>
service in order to easily transmit Internet services, such as web services. When<br>
providing such a high-speed packet service, a peak throughput as well as an<br>
average throughput must be optimized in order to easily transmit packet data and<br>
circuit data, such as voice services.<br>
More specifically, in order to allow a communication system using the<br>
HSDPA scheme (hereinafter, simply referred to as "HSDPA communication<br>
system") to transmit the high-speed packet data, three schemes including an<br>
adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme, a hybrid automatic<br>
retransmission request (HARQ) scheme, and a fast cell select (FCS) scheme are<br>
newly provided for the HSDPA communication system.<br>
The HSDPA communication system improves a data transmission rate<br>
thereof by using the AMC scheme, the HARQ scheme, and the FCS scheme.<br>
Although the HSDPA communication system has been described as an example, a<br>
communication system using a 1x EV-DO/V scheme (hereinafter, simply referred<br>
to as "lx EV-DO/V communication system") may be provided in order to<br>
improve the data transmission rate. In order to improve performance of the 1x<br>
EV-DO/V communication system, the data transmission rate thereof must be<br>
increased.<br>
Other than the above new schemes, such as the AMC scheme, the HARQ<br>
scheme, and the FCS scheme, a multiple antenna scheme can be used in order to<br>
increase the data transmission rate while overcoming a limitation of an assigned<br>
bandwidth. Such a multiple antenna scheme utilizes a space domain in order to<br>
overcome the limitation of bandwidth resource in a frequency domain.<br>
A mobile communication system is constructed such that it communicates<br>
with a plurality of mobile stations through a base station. If the base station<br>
transmits high-speed data to the mobile stations, a fading phenomenon may occur<br>
due to a characteristic of a radio channel. In order to overcome the fading<br>
phenomenon, a transmission antenna diversity scheme, which is a multiple<br>
antenna scheme, has been suggested. According to the transmission antenna<br>
diversity scheme, signals are transmitted through at least two antennas, thai is,<br>
through a multiple antenna in such a manner that transmission loss of data caused<br>
by the fading phenomenon can be minimized, thereby increasing the data<br>
transmission rate.<br>
In general, different than a wired channel environment, a radio channel<br>
environment in a mobile communication system is subject to various parameters,<br>
such as multipath interference, shadowing, wave attenuation, noise, and<br>
interference. As a result, a radio channel may receive a signal distorted from an<br>
actual transmission signal.<br>
Herein, the fading phenomenon caused by the multipath interference<br>
closely relates to a reflective member or a user, that is, relates to mobility of a<br>
mobile station and the radio channel may receive a transmission signal mixed<br>
with an interference signal due to the fading phenomenon. Therefore, the signal<br>
received in the radio channel is distorted from the actual transmission signal so<br>
that performance of the mobile communication system is deteriorated. That is, the<br>
fading phenomenon may distort amplitude and phase of the signal received in the<br>
radio channel, such that the fading phenomenon becomes a main factor<br>
interfering high-speed data communication in the radio channel environment.<br>
Various research have been carried out in an attempt to solve the fading<br>
phenomenon. In short, in order to transmit high-speed data in the mobile<br>
communication system, it is necessary to minimize loss derived from the<br>
characteristics of the mobile communication channel, such as the lading<br>
phenomenon, and interference of users. In order to prevent unstable<br>
communication caused by the fading phenomenon, various diversity schemes<br>
have been adopted by the mobile communication system. One of such diversity<br>
schemes is a space diversity scheme, which uses a multiple antenna.<br>
In addition, a transmission antenna diversity scheme has been suggested<br>
in order to effectively solve the fading phenomenon. According to the<br>
transmission antenna diversity scheme, a radio channel receives a plurality of<br>
transmission signals, which have experienced the fading phenomenon, in order to<br>
deal with the distortion of signals caused by the fading phenomenon. The<br>
transmission antenna diversity scheme includes a time diversity scheme, a<br>
frequency diversity scheme, a multipath diversity scheme, and a space diversity<br>
scheme.<br>
In order to transmit high-speed data, the mobile communication system<br>
must solve the fading phenomenon exerting a bad influence on performance of<br>
the mobile communication system, because the fading phenomenon may reduce<br>
an amplitude of a signal to a few dB to tens of dB. Therefore, the diversity<br>
scheme is used in order to solve the above fading phenomenon. For example, a<br>
code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme utilizes a rake receiver that is<br>
capable of obtaining a diversity function by using a delay spread of a channel.<br>
The rake receiver is a reception diversity type receiver capable of receiving a<br>
multi-path signal. However, the reception diversity type rake receiver has a<br>
disadvantage in that it cannot obtain a required diversity gain if a channel has a<br>
relatively small delay spread.<br>
The time diversity scheme can effectively handle a burst error occurring<br>
in a radio channel environment by using interleaving and coding schemes.<br>
Generally, the time diversity scheme is used in a Doppler spread channel.<br>
However, according to the above time diversity scheme, a diversity effect reduces<br>
in a low-speed Doppler spread channel.<br>
The space diversity scheme is commonly used in a channel having a<br>
relatively small delay spread. For example, the space diversity scheme is used in<br>
an indoor channel and a pedestrian channel, which is a low-speed Doppler spread<br>
channel. According to the space diversity scheme, at least two antennas are used<br>
to obtain a diversity gain. If a signal transmitted through one antenna is attenuated<br>
due to a fading phenomenon, a signal transmitted through the other antenna is<br>
received in the channel, thereby obtaining the diversity gain. The space diversity<br>
scheme is divided into a reception antenna diversity scheme using a plurality of<br>
reception antennas, a transmission antenna diversity scheme using a plurality of<br>
transmission antennas, and a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) scheme<br>
using a plurality of reception antennas and transmission antennas.<br>
According to the MIMO-adaptive antenna array (AAA) scheme, signals<br>
are received through an antenna array including a plurality of reception antennas,<br>
and predetermined weight vectors are applied to signal vectors of the received<br>
signals in such a manner that intensity of desired signals transmitted to a receiver<br>
through a proper transmission direction can be maximized and intensity of<br>
undesired signals transmitted to the receiver through an improper transmission<br>
direction, that is, intensity of undesired signals improperly transmitted to the<br>
receiver can be minimized. In addition, the receiver transmits a signal to a<br>
transmitter after calculating a transmission weight vector for the signal, such that<br>
a beam of a signal transmitted to the receiver from the transmitter can be<br>
effectively created. That is, according to the above MIMO-AAA scheme, only a<br>
required signal is maximally amplified when the signal is received in the receiver.<br>
The signal is radiated toward the receiver with maximum intensity, such that<br>
speech quality can be improved and service areas can be enlarged.<br>
Although the above MIMO-AAA scheme is adaptable for various mobile<br>
communication systems using a frequency division multiple access (FDMA)<br>
scheme, a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, or a CDMA, the<br>
MIMO-AAA scheme will be described in relation to a mobile communication<br>
system using the CDMA scheme (hereinafter, simply referred to as "CDMA<br>
mobile communication system") for convenience of explanation.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating structures of a transmitter and a<br>
receiver of a conventional CDMA mobile communication system. However, prior<br>
to describing FIG. 1, it is noted that the following description is made on the<br>
assumption that the CDMA mobile communication system utilizes an MIMO-<br>
AAA scheme. Accordingly, the transmitter and the receiver must have a plurality<br>
of transmission antennas and reception antennas, respectively. However,<br>
according to FIG. 1, the transmitter and the receiver do not individually have<br>
transmission antennas and reception antennas, but the same antennas are used for<br>
both transmission and reception through a time division scheme by using a<br>
duplexer. In addition, according to FIG. 1, an N-number of antennas is used.<br>
Further, the transmitter and the receiver may be a base station or a mobile station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the transmitter includes an encoder 101, an<br>
interleaver 103, a transmission beam generator 105, a signal processor 107, a<br>
plurality of spreaders including first to Nth spreaders 111, 121, ...., and 131, and<br>
an N-number of radio frequency (RF) processors including first to Nth RF<br>
processors 113, 123,...., and 133. In addition, a duplexer 140 and N antennas,<br>
including first to Nth antennas 141, 143,...., and 145, are commonly used for both<br>
the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
If data to be transmitted is created, the data is input into the encoder 101.<br>
The encoder 101 may encode the data through a predetermined encoding method<br>
and output a signal to the interleaver 103. The encoding method includes a turbo<br>
encoding method or a convolutional encoding method.<br>
Upon receiving the signal from the encoder 101, the interleaver 103 may<br>
interleave the signal through a predetermined interleaving method in order to<br>
prevent a burst error and outputs the signal to the transmission beam generator<br>
105. Herein, the signal output from the interleaver 103 is represented as"<br>
Then, the signal processor 107 calculates a weight based on the signal<br>
output from the interleaver 103 and outputs the signal to the transmission beam<br>
generator 105. The transmission beam generator 105 generates a transmission<br>
beam based on the signal output from the interleaver 103 and the weight<br>
calculated in the signal processor 107, and outputs the transmission beam to the<br>
first to Nth spreaders 111, 121,...., and 131, respectively. That is, the transmission<br>
beam generator 105 receives the signal output from the interleaver 103, creates<br>
the transmission beam, and transmits the transmission beam to each of the first to<br>
Nth spreaders 111, 121,...., and 131 in such a manner that the transmission beam<br>
can be transmitted to each of the first to Nth antennas 141, 143,...., and 145.<br>
Herein, a procedure of creating the transmission beam does not directly relate to<br>
the present invention. Therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
A set of signals output from the transmission beam generator 105 is<br>
represented as " Yk". That is, " Yk" is a set of signals generated from' the<br>
transmission beam generator 105 and mapped with a klh antenna.<br>
The first spreader 111 receives a signal " Yk" output from the<br>
transmission beam generator 105 and spreads the signal " Yk" by using a<br>
predetermined spreading code. After that, the first spreader 111 outputs the signal<br>
X1 to the first RF processor 113. Upon receiving the signal from the first spreader<br>
111, the first RF processor 113 performs an RF-treatment process with respect to<br>
the signal and outputs the signal to the duplexer 140. Each of the RF processors<br>
includes an amplifier, a frequency converter, a filter, and an analog to digital<br>
converter to process RF signals.<br>
In addition, the second spreader 121 receives a signal " Y2" output<br>
from the transmission beam generator 105 and spreads the signal " Y2" by<br>
using a predetermined spreading code. Thereafter, the second spreader 121<br>
outputs the signal X2 to the second RF processor 123. Upon receiving the signal<br>
from the second spreader 111, the second RF processor 123 performs an RF-<br>
treatment process with respect to the signal and outputs the signal to the duplexer<br>
140.<br>
In the same manner, the Nth spreader 131 receives a signal " YN" output<br>
from the transmission beam generator 105 and spreads the signal " YN" by<br>
using a predetermined spreading code. Thereafter, the Nth spreader 131 outputs<br>
the signal xn' to the Nth RF processor 133. Upon receiving the signal from the Nlh<br>
spreader 131, the Nth RF processor 133 performs an RF-treatment process with<br>
respect to the signal and outputs the signal to the duplexer 140.<br>
The duplexer 140 controls the signal transmission and reception<br>
operations by scheduling a transmission point and a receiving point of the signal<br>
under the control of a controller (not shown). In addition, the first to N11 antennas<br>
141, 143,...., and 145 can be operated as transmission antennas (Tx. ANT) or<br>
reception antennas (Rx. ANT) according to the signal transmission and reception<br>
operations of the duplexer 140.<br>
The receiver of the base station of the CDMA mobile communication<br>
system includes N RF processors, including first to Nth RF processors 151,<br>
161,...., and 171, N multipath searchers, including first to Nlh multipath searchers<br>
153, 163,...., 173 corresponding to the RF processors, L fingers, including first to<br>
Lth fingers 180-1, 180-2,...., 180-L for processing signals regarding L multipaths,<br>
which are searched by the multipath searchers, a multipath combiner 191 for<br>
combining multipath signals output from the L-number of fingers, a cle-<br>
interleaver 193, and a decoder 195.<br>
Signals transmitted from a plurality of transmitters are received in the N<br>
antennas through a multipath fading radio channel. The duplexer 140 outputs the<br>
signal received through the first antenna 141 to the first RF processor 151. Upon<br>
receiving the signal from the duplexer 140, the first RF processor 151 performs<br>
an RF-treatment process with respect to the signal to convert the signal into a<br>
baseband digital signal. Then, the first RF processor 151 sends the baseband<br>
digital signal to the first multipath searcher 153. Upon receiving the baseband<br>
digital signal from the first RF processor 151, the first multipath searcher 153<br>
divides the baseband digital signal into L multipath components and outputs the<br>
multipath components to the first to Lth fingers 180-1, 180-2,...., 180-L,<br>
respectively. Each of the first to Lth fingers 180-1, 180-2,...., 180-L is mapped<br>
with each of the L multipaths in a one to one correspondence in order to process<br>
the multipath components. Because the L multipaths must be considered in<br>
relation to each signal received through the N-number of reception antennas, the<br>
signal process must be carried out with respect to an n*I- number of signals.<br>
Among the nxl number of signals, signals having the same path are output to<br>
the same finger.<br>
The duplexer 140 outputs the signal received through the second antenna<br>
143 to the second RF processor 161. Upon receiving the signal from the duplexer<br>
140, the second RF processor 161 performs an RF-treatment process with respect<br>
to the signal to convert the signal into a baseband digital signal. Then, the second<br>
RF processor 161 sends the baseband digital signal to the second multipath<br>
searcher 163. Upon receiving the baseband digital signal from the second RF<br>
processor 161, the second multipath searcher 163 divides the baseband digital<br>
signal into L multipath components and outputs the multipath components to the<br>
first to Lth fingers 180-1, 180-2,...., 180-L, respectively.<br>
In the same manner, the duplexer 140 outputs the signal received through<br>
the Nth antenna 145 to the Nlh RF processor 171. Upon receiving the signal from<br>
the duplexer 140, the Nth RF processor 171 performs an RF-treatment process<br>
with respect to the signal to convert the signal into a baseband digital signal. Then,<br>
the Nth RF processor 171 sends the baseband digital signal to the Nth multipath<br>
searcher 173. Upon receiving the baseband digital signal from the Nth RF<br>
processor 171, the Nth multiparth searcher 173 divides the baseband digital signal<br>
into L multipath components and outputs the multipath components to the first to<br>
Lth fingers 180-1, 180-2,...., 180-L, respectively.<br>
According, among signals received through the N antennas, the same<br>
multipath signals of the L multipath signals are input into the same finger. For<br>
example, first multipath signals of the first to Nth antennas 141 to 145 are input<br>
into the first finger 180-1 and Lth multipath signals of the first to Nth antennas 141<br>
to 145 are input into the Lth finger 180-L. The first to Lth fingers 180-1 to 180-L<br>
have the same structure and operational property even though different signals are<br>
input/output to/from the first to Lth fingers 180-1 to 180-L. Thus, only the<br>
structure and operation of the first finger 180-1 will be described below as an<br>
example.<br>
The first finger 180-1 includes N despreaders, including first to Nth<br>
despreaders 181, 182,...., and 183 corresponding to the N multipath searchers, a<br>
signal processor 184 for receiving signals output from the first to Nth despreaders<br>
181 to 183 and calculating weights thereof to create a reception beam, and a<br>
reception beam generator 185 for creating the reception beam based on the<br>
weights calculated by the signal processor 184.<br>
A first multipath signal output from the first multipath searcher 1 53 is<br>
input into the first despreader 181. Upon receiving the first multipath signal, the<br>
first despreader 181 despreads the first multipath signal by using a predetermined<br>
despreading code and outputs the first multipath signal to the signal processor 184<br>
and the reception beam generator 185. The despreading code is identical to the<br>
spreading code used in each transmitter and the despreading process is called a<br>
"time processing".<br>
In addition, the first multipath signal output from the second multipath<br>
searcher 163 is input into the second despreader 182. Upon receiving the first<br>
multipath signal, the second despreader 182 despreads the first multipath signal<br>
by using a predetermined despreading code and outputs the first multipath signal<br>
to the signal processor 184 and the reception beam generator 185.<br>
In the same manner, a first multipath signal output from the Nth multipath<br>
searcher 173 is input into the Nth despreader 183. Upon receiving the first<br>
multipath signal, the Nth despreader 183 despreads the first multipath signal by<br>
using a predetermined despreading code and outputs the first multipath signal to<br>
the signal processor 184 and the reception beam generator 185.<br>
The signal processor 184 receives signals output from the first to Nth<br>
despreaders 181 to 183 and calculates a set of weights Wk for creating the<br>
reception beam. A set of the first multipath signals output from the first to Nth<br>
multipath searchers 153 to 173 is defined as " " Xk". That is, " Vk" represents a<br>
set of the first multipath signals received at a kth point through the first to Nth<br>
antennas 141 to 145. All of the first multipath signals forming the first multipath<br>
signal set" Xk" are vector signals. In addition, " Wk" represents a set of weights<br>
to be applied to each of the first multipath signals received at the kth point through<br>
the first to Nth antennas 141 to 145. All of the weights forming the weight set<br>
Wk are vector signals.<br>
In addition, a set of despread signals of the first multipath signals forming<br>
the first multipath signal set " Xk" is defined as " Yk". Herein, " Yk"<br>
represents a set of despread signals of the first multipath signals received at a kth<br>
point through the first to Nth antennas 141 to 145. All of the despread signals<br>
forming the despread signal set Yk are vector signals. For the purpose of<br>
convenience of explanation, the term "set" will be omitted below. It is noted that<br>
parameters having under-bar marks represent a set of specific elements.<br>
In addition, because the first to Nth despreaders 181 to 183 despread the<br>
first multipath signals Yk by using the predetermined despreading code, power<br>
of the desired signal received through the proper transmission direction can be<br>
amplified by an amount of a process gain as compared with power of an<br>
interference signal.<br>
As described above, despread signals Yk of the first multipath signals<br>
Xk are input into the signal processor 184. The signal processor 184 calculates<br>
weights Wk based on despread signals Yk of the first multipath signals<br>
Xk and outputs the weights Wk to the reception beam generator 185. That is,<br>
the signal processor 184 calculates N weights Wk applied to the first multipath<br>
signals Xk output from the first to Nth antennas 141 to 145 by using despread<br>
signals Yk of the N first multipath signals Xk The reception beam generator<br>
185 receives the despread signals Yk of the N first multipath signals Xk and<br>
the N of weights Wk.<br>
In addition, the reception beam generator 185 creates the reception beam<br>
by using the N weights Wk. Thereafter, the reception beam generator 185<br>
outputs a signal as an output signal zkof the first finger 180-1 by combining the<br>
despread signals Yk of the N first multipath signals Xk with the weights<br>
Wk of the reception beams. The output signal zk of the first finger 180-1 may-<br>
be represented as shown below in Equation 1.<br>
Equation 1 represents a Hermitian operator, i.e., a transpose of a<br>
conjugate. In addition, Zk, which is a set of output signals zk output from the N<br>
fingers of the receiver is finally input into the multipath combiner 191.<br>
Even though only the operation of the first finger 180-1 has been<br>
described above as an example, other fingers may operate in the same manner as<br>
the first finger 180-1. Therefore, the multipath combiner 191 receives the signals<br>
output from the first to Lth fingers, combines the signals with each other through a<br>
multipath scheme, and outputs the signals to the de-interleaver 193. The de-<br>
interleaver 193 receives the signals output from the multipath combiner 191, de-<br>
interleaves the signals through a predetermined de-interleaving method<br>
corresponding to the interleaving method used in the transmitter, and outputs the<br>
signals to the decoder 195. Upon receiving the signals from the de-interleaver 193,<br>
the decoder 195 decodes the signals through a decoding method corresponding to<br>
the encoding method used in the transmitter and outputs signals as final reception<br>
data.<br>
The signal processor 184 calculates weights Wk according to a<br>
predetermined algorithm in order to minimize a mean square error (MSE) of a<br>
signal transmitted from a desired transmitter. In addition, the reception beam<br>
generator 185 creates a reception beam by using the weights Wk calculated by<br>
the signal processor 184. The process for creating the reception beam such that<br>
the MSE can be minimized is called a "spatial processing". Of course, the process<br>
for creating a transmission beam such that the MSE can be minimized is also<br>
called a "spatial processing". Therefore, when the M1M0-AAA scheme is used<br>
for the mobile communication system, the time processing and the spatial<br>
processing are simultaneously performed, which is called "spatial-temporal<br>
processing".<br>
As described above, the signal processor 184 calculates weights Wk<br>
capable of maximizing a gain of the MIMO-AAA scheme according to a<br>
predetermined algorithm by receiving multipath signals, before the multipath<br>
signals have been despread and after the multipath signals have been dcsprcad in<br>
each finger. In the same manner, the we.ghts Wk capable of maximizing a gain<br>
of the MIMO-AAA scheme are calculated in the transmitter according to a<br>
predetermined algorithm. The signal processor 184 and the transmission beam<br>
generator 105 operate in order to achieve a minimum MSE.<br>
Recently, research has been actively carried out regarding an algorithm<br>
for calculating weights in order to minimize the MSE. According to the algorithm<br>
for calculating weights for minimizing the MSE, an error is reduced on the basis<br>
of a reference signal. If the reference signal does not exist, the algorithm may<br>
provide a constant modulus (CM) scheme and a decision-directed (DD) scheme<br>
through a blind method.<br>
However, the algorithm for minimizing the MSE according to a reference<br>
signal is not adaptable if a channel is subject to a fast fading environment. For<br>
example, if a channel is subject to a fast fading environment, such as a fast fading<br>
channel, or a higher order modulation environment, such as 16QAM, it is difficult<br>
to obtain the MSE having a minimum value required by a system through the<br>
algorithm.<br>
Further, even if the minimum MSE can be obtained through the algorithm,<br>
the minimum MSE has a relatively large value. If the minimum MSE is<br>
determined with a relatively large value, a gain expected when the MIMO-AAA<br>
scheme is applied to the mobile communication system may be significantly<br>
reduced, such that it is not adaptable for a high-speed data communication system.<br>
In addition, because both a transmitter and a receiver must calculate the weights<br>
for creating the transmission beam and the reception beam, respectively, a greater<br>
load may occur when calculating the weights.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description of the present invention, a detailed description of known functions<br>
and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may obscure the<br>
subject matter of the present invention.<br>
Prior to describing the present invention, herein below, a description will<br>
be made relating to a signal model received in a receiver of a mobile<br>
communication system using a CDMA scheme. The receiver may include a base<br>
station receiver or a mobile station receiver capable of receiving a signal. Herein,<br>
however, the base station receiver will be utilized as an example of the receiver in<br>
order to describe a received signal model.<br>
The base station receiver includes a reception antenna array (Rx antenna<br>
array) having a plurality of reception antennas. In addition, although the present<br>
invention may be adaptable for various mobile communication systems using an<br>
FDMA scheme, a TDMA scheme, a CDMA scheme, or an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing OFDM scheme, the present invention will be described in<br>
relation to a mobile communication system using the CDMA scheme (hereinafter,<br>
simply referred to as "CDMA mobile communication system") and a mobile<br>
communication system using the OFDM scheme (hereinafter, simply referred 10<br>
as "OFDM mobile communication system") for convenience of explanation.<br>
A signal transmitted from a predetermined mobile station that is located<br>
in a cell in a service area of a base station, that is, a signal transmitted from a<br>
transmitter of an mth mobile station, is represented as shown below in Equation 2.<br>
In Equation 2, sm(t) represents a transmission signal of the mth mobile<br>
station, pm represents transmission power of the mth mobile station, bm(t)<br>
represents a user information bit sequence of the mth mobile station, and cm(t)<br>
represents a user spreading code sequence of the m"1 mobile station having a<br>
chip period of Tc.<br>
The transmission signal transmitted from the transmitter of the mobile<br>
station is received in the receiver of the base station through a multipath vector<br>
channel. Herein, channel parameters of the multipath vector channel are<br>
assumed that they may vary with a relatively low speed in relation to a bit period<br>
Tb. Accordingly, it is assumed that the channel parameters are constantly<br>
maintained during predetermined bit periods. Therefore, a complex baseband<br>
signal received in the receiver of the base station through a first multipath of the<br>
mth mobile station is represented as shown below in Equation 3. H is noted that<br>
the received signal represented in Equation 3 is an RF signal, which has been<br>
received in the receiver of the base station and down-converted into a baseband<br>
signal.<br>
In above Equation 3, Xml(t) represents a set of complex baseband<br>
signals received in the receiver through the first multipath of the mth mobile<br>
station, aml represents an attenuation degree of fading applied to the first<br>
multipath of the mth mobile station, ml represents a phase transition applied to<br>
the first multipath of the mth mobile station, t ml represents a time delay applied<br>
to the first multipath of the mth mobile station, and aml represents a set of an<br>
array responses (AR) applied to the first multipath of the m'1' mobile<br>
station.Because the receiver of the base station includes N reception antennas,<br>
the signal transmitted from the mth mobile station may be received in the<br>
receiver through the N reception antennas, such that N signals are received in<br>
the receiver through the first multipath of the mth mobile station. Thus, N<br>
complex baseband signals received in the receiver through the first multipath of<br>
the mth mobile station may form a set of the complex baseband signals. For the<br>
purpose of convenience of explanation, the term "set" will be omitted below. As<br>
indicated above, it is noted that parameters having under bar marks represent a<br>
set of specific elements.<br>
If a currently used linear antenna array is utilized, the array responses<br>
-ml may be represented as shown below in Equation 4.<br>
In Equation 4, d represents an interval between reception antennas,<br>
represents a wavelength in a usable frequency band, N represents the number of<br>
reception antennas, and ml represents a direction of arrival (DOA) applied to<br>
the first multipath of the mth mobile station.<br>
In addition, on the assumption that the number of mobile stations existing<br>
in a cell positioned in a service area of a base station is "M" and L multipaths<br>
may exist corresponding to the M mobile stations, the signal received in the base<br>
station may include not only signals transmitted from each of the mobile stations.<br>
but also additive white noise. The signal can represented in Equation 5.<br>
In above Equation 5, n(t) represents a set of additive white noise added<br>
to the transmission signals transmitted from the M mobile stations.<br>
Among those reception signals satisfying Equation 5, desired signals<br>
required by the base station are defined as X11. Herein, X11 may represent<br>
signals transmitted from a first mobile station through the first multipath.<br>
Because the desired signals required by the base station are defined as X11, all<br>
signals except forX11 are regarded as interference signals and noise.<br>
Therefore, Equation 5 can be replaced with Equation 6.<br>
In Equation 6, i(t) represents interference signals. The interference<br>
signals can be represented as follows in Equation 7.<br>
In Equation 7 representing interference signals, although a first-half term<br>
indicates the desired transmission signals of the mobile station required by the<br>
base station, the first-half term represents undesired inter-path interference<br>
signals transmitted through multipaths. In addition, a second-half term of<br>
Equation 7 represents multiple access interference signals caused by other<br>
mobile stations.<br>
In addition, X(t)is despread using a despread code C1|(t - t 11), which<br>
is determined in a finger, that is, in a first finger (1=1) existing in a<br>
corresponding multipath of a corresponding channel card of the base station<br>
receiver, that is, a channel card ( m = l) assigned to the first mobile station.<br>
After the despreading for signals X(t) has been performed, signals y(t) arc<br>
represented. Equation 8 below shows the signals y(t). Herein, the despread<br>
code c1(t - t ,,) is identical to the spread code c1(t - t 11) used m the<br>
transmitter of the mobile station for transmitting the signal. In addition, the base<br>
station has a plurality of receivers having the structure described with reference<br>
to FIG. 1. Herein, each of the receivers is called a "channel card" and one<br>
channel card is assigned to one mobile station. In addition, as is already<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1, the channel card has a plurality of fingers<br>
corresponding to the number of multipaths and each finger is mapped with each<br>
multipath signal on a one to one basis.<br>
In Equation 8, k represents a kth sampling point.<br>
If signals y(t) are created by despreading signals X(t) using the<br>
despread code C1(t - T 11), power of desired signals required by the receiver of<br>
the base station may be amplified by a process gain G corresponding to the<br>
characteristics of the despreader. Herein, it is noted that power of desired signals<br>
required by the receiver of the base station can be amplified by a process gain (i,<br>
but power of undesired signals can be constantly maintained. Accordingly, it is<br>
possible to obtain a correlation matrix between reception signals X(t) and<br>
despread reception signals Y(t). In order to obtain the correlation matrix<br>
between reception signals X(t) and despread reception signals X(t),<br>
sampling work for the reception signals X(t) is performed at the kth sampling<br>
point, at which sample work for despread reception signals Y(t) is also<br>
performed. Equation 9 shows sampling signals of reception signals X(t) at the<br>
kth sampling point.<br>
That is, the correlation matrix between reception signals X(t) and<br>
despread reception signals Y(t) can be achieved on the assumption that the<br>
sampling signals as shown in Equation 9 are obtained by sampling reception<br>
signals X(t) at the kth sampling point, which is identical to the sampling point<br>
of despread reception signals Y(t), and reception signals X(t) and reception<br>
signals Y(t) maintain the stationary state.<br>
Hereinafter, a two-step least mean square (LMS) method will be<br>
described.<br>
Complex reception signals received through the N reception antennas at a<br>
predetermined point, that is, a set of complex reception signals x1 to xN, which<br>
are received through first to Nth reception antennas and are not yet despread. is<br>
defined as X=[x1x2- . • xn] . Herein, T is an operator representing a<br>
transpose operation. In addition, a set of complex reception signals x, to xN,<br>
which are received through first to Nth reception antennas and are despread, is<br>
defined as Y=[y1y2- . • yn]T . The despread reception signals Y may<br>
consist of desired signal components s required by the receiver of the base<br>
station and undesired signal components u. Equation 10 represents the<br>
despread reception signals Y .<br>
In addition, a set of complex weights applied to complex reception<br>
signals X1 to xN received through the N-number of reception antennas, that is, a<br>
set of complex weights W1 to wN, which will be multiplied with complex<br>
reception signals X1 to xN received through the N-number of reception antennas,<br>
respectively, is defined as W=[w1w2- . • wn] .<br>
Thus, output signals z of a channel card of a predetermined user, that is,<br>
output signals Z , output from fingers in a channel card assigned to a specific<br>
mobile station, may be obtained by combining weights W with despread<br>
reception signals Y. Equation 11 represents the output signals Z.<br>
In Equation 11, i represents the number of reception antennas.<br>
The output signals Z can be divided into desired signal components<br>
WHS, which are required by the receiver of the base station and undesired<br>
signal components WHU according to Equations 10 and 11. The LMS method<br>
is provided for minimizing an error of a reference signal and a reception signal,<br>
that is, the LMS method may minimize a cost function J(w) as shown in<br>
Equation 12.<br>
In Equation 12, J is a cost function. Accordingly, it is necessary to find a<br>
value of W capable of minimizing a value of the cost function J. In addition, eh<br>
represents a difference between a received signal and a desired signal, that is, ek<br>
represents an error, and dk represents the desired signal. According to a beam<br>
creation algorithm using a non-blind method, a pilot signal is used as the desired<br>
dk. However, the present invention suggests a beam creation algorithm using a<br>
blind method, so the beam creation algorithm using the non-blind method will<br>
not be further described below.<br>
In Equation 12, the cost function J is provided in the form of a quadratic<br>
convex function. Thus, in order to minimize a value of the cost function J, it is<br>
necessary to differentiate the cost function J such that a differential value of the<br>
cost function J becomes zero. The differential value of the cost function J is<br>
represented in Equation 13.<br>
However, it is difficult to obtain an optimal weigh value Wopt at a time<br>
under an actual channel environment. Accordingly, because despread reception<br>
signals Yk are input in every predetermined period of time, a reflexive<br>
equation, such as Equation 14 below, must be used in order to adaptively or<br>
reflexively obtain the optimal weigh value Wopt.<br>
received at the kth point, u is a constant gain value, and VRk represents a<br>
trace vector at the kth point. The trace vector VRk of the kth point allows the<br>
cost function J to have a differential value converged into a minimum value, that<br>
is, into zero. For convenience of explanation, a weight used for creating a<br>
transmission beam of a transmitter is referred to as a "transmission weight" and<br>
a weight used for creating a reception beam of a receiver is referred to as<br>
"reception weight".<br>
Equation 14 represents an update process for the weight. That is, when<br>
the weight WR.k to be used in the present time is given, a weight obtain<br>
through a forward transition or a rearward transition of the weight WR.k in a<br>
direction of the trace vector VR.k by a constant gain value is updated as a next<br>
weight WR.k to be used in the next time.<br>
In addition, Equation 14 can be replaced with Equation 15 in view of a<br>
mean square.<br>
The present invention suggests a weight feed back apparatus and a<br>
method thereof for creating a transmission beam by using the M1M0-AAA<br>
scheme. In addition, the present invention suggests an apparatus and a method<br>
capable of creating weights for the transmission beam and the reception beam<br>
through a combination-type weight creation method.<br>
As shown in Equation 16, the weight of the transmitter is calculated in<br>
the receiver, using a restored signal. Accordingly, the receiver must transmit the<br>
calculated weight to the transmitter. That is, the receiver calculates the weight of<br>
the transmitter by using a restored signal Zk , which can be calculated based on<br>
the despread reception signal and reception weight. Thus, according to the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the weight of the transmitter<br>
calculated by the receiver is transmitted into the transmitter.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of calculating the reception weight will be<br>
described with reference to Equations 17 to 28. For convenience of explanation.<br>
spread and despread operations will be omitted in the above procedure. In<br>
addition, parameters used in Equations 17 to 28 are identical to parameters<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1. A signal provided before a beam is generated<br>
from the transmitter is defined as " zk" in FIG. 2. At this time, if a channel is<br>
defined as a matrix H, xk will be represented as follows in Equation 17.<br>
Herein, a signal received by means of a reception beam generator is<br>
represented as follows in Equation 18.<br>
In Equation 18, a term regarding noise is omitted for convenience of<br>
calculation. In this case, an error signal occurring in a kth time interval is<br>
represented as follows in Equation 19.<br>
Herein, in order to obtain a transmission antenna weight, Equation 10 is<br>
differentiated about wT., such that an error differential value is obtained as<br>
represented in Equation 20.<br>
In Equation 20, an error value e k is represented as follows in Equation<br>
21.<br>
In addition, a transmission beam creation vector can be represented as<br>
follows in Equation 22, by using Equation 21.<br>
In addition, Equations 23 and 24 can be obtained through rearranging the<br>
reception signals of the receiver by multiplying both sides of Equation 22 with<br>
wT.<br>
As described above, an optimum weight Wopt is a very important<br>
factor for creating the reception beam. The present invention minimizes an error<br>
of a reference signal and a reception signal by using the two-step LMS method.<br>
That is, according to the present invention, weights wrt and wrt, which are<br>
capable of minimizing the value of the cost function described with reference to<br>
Equation 12, are obtained so as to obtain the optical weight Wopt That is, the<br>
present invention suggests a new method of detecting a desired signal d(k) as<br>
shown in Equation 12, and suggests a method for feeding back the transmission<br>
weight wt.k to the transmitter after calculating the transmission weight wt.k, using<br>
the reception weight calculated by the receiver.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the desired signal<br>
d(k) is detected through a blind method. Thus, it is necessary to adaptively<br>
converge the reception signal by using a specific estimated value. In order to<br>
adaptively converge the reception signal, a combination-mode blind method is<br>
employed, which will be described in more detail herein below. Here, the<br>
combination-mode blind method refers to a method employing a combination of<br>
the CM scheme and the DD scheme in converging a signal.<br>
As indicated above, the CM scheme is defective in that it has a slow<br>
converging speed, and the DD scheme is defective in that it is highly probable tor<br>
the DD scheme to fail to converge a signal in a high order modulation<br>
environment or a fast fading environment, such as a fast fading channel.<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention, the CM scheme and the DD<br>
scheme are combined using a proper function (c.g, sigmoid function), thereby<br>
enabling signals to converge into a relatively small MSE value.<br>
In properly combining the CM scheme and the DD scheme, the sigmoid<br>
function is employed in a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
However, the present invention may employ not only the sigmoid function but<br>
also any function or means capable of calculating the error value by applying<br>
weights to the two schemes in consideration of the efficiency of the two schemes<br>
determining the error value which is a parameter necessary in the weight<br>
calculation. In other words, a method capable of calculating an error value by two<br>
different schemes (e.g., the CM scheme and the DD scheme) may employ a<br>
proper function, which applies a larger weight to a scheme, which can be more<br>
effectively applied during a predetermined period of time.<br>
For example, the CM scheme and the DD scheme show different<br>
efficiencies according to the time point of convergence of signals, that is, the CM<br>
scheme shows more rapid convergence at an initial stage while the DD scheme<br>
can do more exact convergence thereafter. Therefore, it is preferred that the<br>
weight is calculated in reflection of the CM scheme more than the DD scheme at<br>
an initial stage, and in reflection of the DD scheme more than the CM scheme<br>
after the initial stage.<br>
In the combination-mode blind method, an error function can be<br>
expressed as the following equation 27 using a sigmoid function.<br>
Equation 27 shows that the CM scheme more than the DD scheme are<br>
used combination with each other in the entire process where the reception signal<br>
DD ,, i.U),v<br>
is adaptively converged. That is, when &amp;k has a large value, the * ' k<br>
become larger and the element of the CM scheme has a more important effect on<br>
the entire error value.<br>
In equation 27, g(x) represents an S-shaped function (i.e., sigmoid<br>
function), by which the CM scheme has a larger effect on a range where the DD<br>
scheme has a smaller effect and the DD scheme has a larger effect on a range<br>
where the CM scheme has a smaller effect.<br>
As noted from equation 27, the error value ek is obtained by applying a<br>
weight of ak to the error value ekCM of the reception signal obtained through<br>
calculation using the CM scheme and applying a weight of ßk represents to the<br>
error value ekDD of the reception signal obtained through calculation using the CM<br>
scheme and then adding the weighted error values to each other.<br>
In equation 27, g(x) is a sigmoid function, the characteristic of which is<br>
shown in FIG. 7. Referring to FIG. 7, the characteristic of the S shape depends on<br>
the value a. As the value a increases, the shape of the function becomes more<br>
similar to an S. As the value a becomes closer to 1, the shape of the function<br>
becomes closer to a straight line. Therefore, in equation 17 containing the sigmoid<br>
function, pk decreases when ak increases and pk increases when ak decreases.<br>
When the error value ekCM of the reception signal obtained through<br>
calculation using the CM scheme exceeds the error value ek of the reception<br>
signal obtained through calculation using the CM scheme, the error value ek is<br>
obtained through combination of the weighted CM scheme and the DD scheme-<br>
having been weighted more than the CM scheme. However, when the error value<br>
ekCM of the reception signal obtained through calculation using the CM scheme<br>
does not exceed the error value ek00 of the reception signal obtained through<br>
calculation using the CM scheme, the error value ek is obtained through<br>
combination of the weighted DD scheme and the CM scheme having been<br>
weighted more than the DD scheme.<br>
Hereinafter, the CM scheme and the DD scheme will be described in<br>
more detail.<br>
The CM scheme is suggested by Godard, and is generally used for a blind<br>
equalizer and a beam creation algorithm. If the CM scheme suggested by Godard<br>
is used, the cost function J is represented as follows in Equation 28.<br>
In Equation 28, p is a predetermined positive integer, and Rp is a Godard<br>
Modulus. Herein, the Godard modulus Rp is represented as follows in Equation 20.<br>
Recently, discussion has been actively carried out regarding an OFDM<br>
mobile communication system. In general, the OFDM mobile communication<br>
system uses a relatively higher order modulation more than a quadrature phase<br>
shift keying modulation, so the cost function J is divided into a real number<br>
section and an imaginary number section when calculating the cost function J as<br>
represented in Equation 30 because the transmitting signal and the reception<br>
signal have real number components and imaginary number components due to<br>
the higher order modulation.<br>
It is assumed that the present invention uses the combination-type I.MS<br>
method and p is 2. Accordingly, the desired signal d(k) is determined as<br>
d(k)=R2,R+jR2.1 In addition, at an initial point (herein, k = 0), a value of the<br>
cost function J is assumed to be zero (J=0).<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic view illustrating the CM scheme used in a mobile<br>
communication system when p = 2, d(K)-R2.R+JR 2.1 and J - 0 ( herein, k= 0).<br>
As described above, FIG. 8 shows the CM scheme used when the value of the cost<br>
function J becomes 0 at a point in which k = 0, p = 2, and d(k) R2.R 2.1.<br>
That is, when the value of R2 is determined according to Equation 30, a circle is<br>
formed on a coordinate surface. Thus, when drawing an extension line from a<br>
center point of the circle, the extension line meets the circumferential line of the<br>
circle. A received signal may be determined based on a point at which the<br>
extension line meets the circumferential line of the circle. As illustrated in FIG. 8,<br>
the signal zk restored in the receiver is projected into the circle.<br>
In the same manner as in the CM scheme, the real number section and the<br>
imaginary number section must be separately calculated in the DD scheme. In<br>
Equation 31, Pr signifies that the signal is transmitted substantially identical to the<br>
desired signal d(k) through the DD scheme. According to the DD scheme, the<br>
desired signal d(k) is projected with an approximate coordinate value in relation<br>
to a coordinate value of the received signal.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic view illustrating the DD scheme when a BPSK<br>
scheme is used in the mobile communication system. Referring to FIG. 0, because<br>
the mobile communication system uses the BPSK (binary phase shift keying)<br>
scheme, if the received signal has a coordinate value of (1.2, -0.2) on an I-Q<br>
domain, the desired signal d(k) is projected with an approximate coordinate value<br>
of 1 after measuring a distance in relation to +1 and -1.<br>
As described above, the present invention enables a reception signal to be<br>
converted to a original signal very quickly and exactly by combining the CM<br>
scheme and the DD scheme, after applying a sigmoid function to them. Further,<br>
according to the present invention, an error value with a minimum cost function is<br>
obtained by a method employing the combination of the two schemes, and not<br>
only a reception weight but also a transmission weight are determined by means<br>
of the error value.<br>
Hereinafter, adaptive antenna array system and method using the<br>
reception weight and the transmission weight determined by the combination-type<br>
weight creation method will be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 2<br>
through 6.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating structures of the transmitter and the<br>
receiver of the base station of the CDMA mobile communication system<br>
performing functions according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Structures of the transmitter and the receiver of the base station performing<br>
functions shown in FIG. 2 according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
are identical to structures of the transmitter and the receiver of the base station<br>
shown in FIG. 1, except for a feedback information generator 286, which is newly<br>
added to the present invention, a weight determining procedure of a signal<br>
processor 284, and a feedback operation for transmitting the weight determined<br>
by the signal processor 284 to the transmitter of the mobile station corresponding<br>
to the receiver of the base station.<br>
However, prior to describing FIG. 2 in more detail, it is noted that the<br>
following description is made on the assumption that the CDMA mobile<br>
communication system adopts the MIMO-AAA scheme. Accordingly, the<br>
transmitter and the receiver must have a plurality of transmission antennas and<br>
reception antennas, respectively. However, according to FIG. 2, the transmitter<br>
and the receiver do not individually have transmission antennas and reception<br>
antennas, but the same antennas are used for both transmitter and receiver through<br>
a time division scheme by using a duplexer. In addition, according to FIG. 2, N<br>
antennas are used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the transmitter of the base station includes an encoder<br>
201, an interleaver 203, a transmission beam generator 205, a signal processor<br>
207, a plurality of spreaders, including first to Nth spreaders 211, 221, ..... and<br>
231, and N RF processors, including first to Nth RF processors 213, 223___and<br>
233. A duplexer 240 and N antennas, including first to Nth antennas 241, 243,.....<br>
and 245, are commonly used for both transmitter and receiver.<br>
If data to be transmitted is created, the data is input into the encoder 201.<br>
The encoder 201 may encode the data through a predetermined encoding method<br>
and output a signal to the interleaver 203. Herein, the data to be transmitted is<br>
feedback information data including the transmission weight WT.k created from<br>
the signal processor 284 of the receiver of the base station. Because the<br>
transmission weight WT.k is described in more detail later, a detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted for now.<br>
In addition, the encoding method includes a turbo encoding method or a<br>
convolutional encoding method. Upon receiving the signal from the encoder 201,<br>
the interleaver 203 may interleave the signal through a predetermined interleaving<br>
method in order to prevent a burst error and outputs the signal to the transmission<br>
beam generator 205. The signal output from the interleaver 203 is defined as<br>
" zk". The signal processor 207 calculates a weight based on the signal<br>
output from the interleaver 203 and outputs the signal to the transmission beam<br>
generator 205.<br>
The transmission beam generator 205 generates a transmission beam<br>
based on the signal zk output from the interleaver 203 and the weight calculated<br>
in the signal processor 207 and outputs the transmission beam to the first to Nth<br>
spreaders 211, 221,...., and 231, respectively. Further, the transmission beam<br>
generator 205 generates the transmission beam by separately calculating the<br>
weights for generating the transmission beam.<br>
As indicated above, a procedure of creating the transmission beam does<br>
not directly relate to the present invention. Therefore, a detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted herein.<br>
If the receiver of the base station has previously received the feedback<br>
information data from the transmitter of the mobile station, the transmission beam<br>
generator 205 may create the transmission beam by using the transmission weight<br>
Wt.k contained in the feedback information data. A process of creating tin-<br>
transmission beam by receiving the transmission weight -' will be described<br>
later with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
A set of signals output from the transmission beam generator 205 is<br>
represented as " Yk ". That is, Yk is a set of signals generated from the<br>
transmission beam generator 205 and mapped with a kth antenna.<br>
The first spreader 211 receives a signal Yk output from the<br>
transmission beam generator 205 and spreads the signal y1 using a<br>
predetermined spreading code. Thereafter, the first spreader 211 outputs the signal<br>
x1 to the first RF processor 213. Upon receiving the signal from the first spreader<br>
211, the first RF processor 213 performs an RF-treatment process with respect to<br>
the signal and outputs the signal to the duplexer 240. Herein, each of the RF<br>
processors includes an amplifier, a frequency converter, a filter, and an analog to<br>
digital converter so as to process RF signals.<br>
In addition, the second spreader 221 receives a signal Y2 output<br>
from the transmission beam generator 205 and spreads the signal Y2 by<br>
using a predetermined spreading code. Thereafter, the second spreader 221<br>
outputs the signal x2' to the second RF processor 223. Upon receiving the signal<br>
from the second spreader 211, the second RF processor 223 performs an RF-<br>
treatment process with respect to the signal and outputs the signal to the duplexer<br>
240.<br>
In the same manner, the Nth spreader 231 receives a signal Yn output<br>
from the transmission beam generator 205 and spreads the signal Yn by<br>
using a predetermined spreading code. Thereafter, the Nth spreader 231 outputs<br>
the signal xn' to the Nth RF processor 233. Upon receiving the signal from the Nth<br>
spreader 231, the Nth RF processor 233 performs an RF-treatment process with<br>
respect to the signal and outputs the signal to the duplexer 240.<br>
The duplexer 240 controls the signal transmission and reception<br>
operations by scheduling a transmission point and a receiving point of the signal<br>
under the control of a controller (not shown). In addition, the first to Nth antennas<br>
241, 243,...., and 245 can be operated as transmission antennas (Tx. ANT) or<br>
reception antennas (Rx. ANT) according to the signal transmission and reception<br>
operations of the duplexer 240.<br>
The receiver includes N RF processors, including first to Nth RF<br>
processors 251, 261,...., and 271, N multipath searchers, including first to Nth<br>
multipath searchers 253, 263,...., 273, corresponding to the RF processors, L<br>
fingers, including first to Lth fingers 280-1, 280-2,...., 280-L, for processing<br>
signals regarding an L-number of multipaths, which are searched by the multipath<br>
searchers, a multipath combiner 291 for combining multipath signals output from<br>
the L fingers, a de-interleaver 293, and a decoder 295.<br>
Signals transmitted from a plurality of transmitters are received in the N<br>
antennas through a multipath fading radio channel. The duplexer 240 outputs the<br>
signal received through the first antenna 241 to the first RF processor 251. Upon<br>
receiving the signal from the duplexer 240, the first RF processor 251 performs<br>
an RF-treatment process with respect to the signal to convert the signal into a<br>
baseband digital signal. The first RF processor 251 sends the baseband digital<br>
signal to the first multipath searcher 253. Upon receiving the baseband digital<br>
signal from the first RF processor 251, the first multipath searcher 253 divides the<br>
baseband digital signal into L multipath components and outputs the multipath<br>
components to the first to Lth fingers 280-1, 280-2,...., 280-L, respectively.<br>
Herein, each of the first to Lth fingers 280-1, 280-2,...., 280-L is mapped with<br>
each of the L multipaths in a one to one correspondence in order to process the<br>
multipath components. Because the L multipaths must be considered in relation to<br>
each signal received through the N reception antennas, the signal process must be<br>
carried out with respect to an NxL number of signals. Among the NxL<br>
number of signals, signals having the same path are output to the same finger.<br>
In addition, the duplexer 240 outputs the signal received through the<br>
second antenna 243 to the second RF processor 26 i. Upon receiving the signal<br>
from the duplexer 240, the second RF processor 261 performs an RF-trealment<br>
process with respect to the signal so as to convert the signal into a baseband<br>
digital signal. The second RF processor 261 sends the baseband digital signal to<br>
the second multipath searcher 263. Upon receiving the baseband digital signal<br>
from the second RF processor 261, the second multipath searcher 263 divides the<br>
baseband digital signal into L multipath components and outputs the multipalh<br>
components to the first to Lth fingers 280-1, 280-2,...., 280-L, respectively.<br>
In the same manner, the duplexer 240 outputs the signal received through<br>
the Nth antenna 245 to the Nth RF processor 271. Upon receiving the signal from<br>
the duplexer 240, the Nth RF processor 271 processes RF of the signal so as to<br>
convert the signal into a baseband digital signal. The Nth RF processor 271 sends<br>
the baseband digital signal to the Nth multipath searcher 273. Upon receiving the<br>
baseband digital signal from the Nth RF processor 271, the Nlh multipath searcher<br>
273 divides the baseband digital signal into L multipath components and outputs<br>
the multipath components to the first to Lth fingers 280-1, 280-2,...., 280-L,<br>
respectively.<br>
Accordingly, among signals received through the N antennas, the same<br>
multipath signals of the L multipath signals are input into the same finger. For<br>
example, first multipath signals of the first to Nth antennas 241 to 245 are input<br>
into the first finger 280-1, and Lth multipath signals of the first to Nth antennas 241<br>
to 245 are input into the Lth finger 280-L. The first to Lth fingers 280-1 to 280-1,<br>
have the same structure and operation with each other even though different<br>
signals are input/output to/from the first to Lth fingers 280-1 to 280-L. Therefore,<br>
only the structure and operation of the first finger 280-1 will be described below<br>
as an example.<br>
The first finger 280-1 includes N despreaders, including first to Nth<br>
despreaders 281, 282,...., and 283, which correspond to the N multipath searchers,<br>
the signal processor 284 for receiving signals output from the first to Nth<br>
despreaders 281 to 283 in order to calculate the reception weights WRk for<br>
creating the reception beam and the transmission weights WRk of the transmitter of<br>
the mobile station corresponding to the receiver of the base station, a reception<br>
beam generator 285 for creating the reception beam based on the reception<br>
weights WRk calculated by the signal processor 284, and a feedback<br>
information generator 286 for creating feedback information including the<br>
transmission weights WR.k calculated by the signal processor 284.<br>
The first multipath signal output from the first multipath searcher 253 is<br>
input into the first despreader 281. Upon receiving the first multipath signal, (he<br>
first despreader 281 despreads the first multipath signal by using a predetermined<br>
despreading code and outputs the first multipath signal to the signal processor 284<br>
and the reception beam generator 285. In addition, the first multipath signal<br>
output from the second multipath searcher 263 is input into the second despreader<br>
282. Upon receiving the first multipath signal, the second despreader 282<br>
despreads the first multipath signal by using a predetermined despreading code<br>
and outputs the first multipath signal to the signal processor 284 and the reception<br>
beam generator 285. Similarly, the first multipath signal output from the Nth<br>
multipath searcher 273 is input into the Nth despreader 283. Upon receiving the<br>
first multipath signal, the Nth despreader 283 despreads the first multipath signal<br>
by using a predetermined despreading code and outputs the first multipath signal<br>
to the signal processor 284 and the reception beam generator 285.<br>
The signal processor 284 receives signals output from the first to Nth<br>
despreaders 281 to 283 and calculates reception weights WRk for creating the<br>
reception beam. Herein, a set of the first multipath signals output from the first to<br>
Nth multipath searchers 253 to 273 is defined as "Xk". That is, Xk represents<br>
a set of the first multipath signals received at a kth point through the first to Nth<br>
antennas 241 to 245. All of the first multipath signals forming the first multipath<br>
signal set Xk are vector signals. In addition, WR.k represents a set of the<br>
reception weights to be applied to each of the first multipath signals received at<br>
the kth point through the first to Nth antennas 241 to 245. All of the weights<br>
forming the reception weight set WR.k are vector signals.<br>
In addition, a set of despread signals of the first multipath signals forming<br>
the first multipath signal set Xk is defined as "YR.k". Herein, yk represents<br>
a set of despread signals of the first multipath signals received at a kth point<br>
through the first to Nth antennas 241 to 245. All of the despread signals funning<br>
the despread signal set Yk are vector signals. For the purpose of convenience<br>
of explanation, the term "set" will be omitted below. It is noted that parameters<br>
having under bar marks represent a set of specific elements.<br>
In addition, since the first to Nth despreaders 281 to 283 despread the first<br>
multipath signals Xk by using the predetermined despreading code, power of<br>
the desired signal can be amplified by an amount of a process gain as compared<br>
with power of an interference signal.<br>
As described above, despread signals yk of the first multipath signals<br>
Xk are input into the signal processor 284. The signal processor 284 calculates<br>
reception weights WR.K based on despread signals Yk of the first multipath<br>
signals XK and outputs the reception weights WR.K to the reception beam<br>
generator 285. That is, the signal processor 284 calculates N reception weights<br>
WR.K applied to the first multipath signals XK output from the first to Nth<br>
antennas 241 to 245 by using despread signals YK of the N first multipath<br>
signals XK. The reception beam generator 285 receives the despread signals<br>
YK of the N first multipath signals XK and the N reception weights WR.K<br>
In addition, the reception beam generator 285 creates the reception beam by using<br>
the N reception weights WR.K Thereafter, the reception beam generator 285<br>
outputs a signal as an output signal zk of the first finger 280-1 by combining the<br>
despread signals YK of the N first multipath signals XK with the reception<br>
weights WR.K of the reception beams.<br>
In addition, ZK which is a set of output signals zk output from the N<br>
fingers of the base station receiver is finally input into the multipath combiner<br>
291. The signal processor 284 calculates the transmission weights WK by using<br>
the reception weights WR.K and then, outputs the transmission weights WR.K to<br>
the feedback information generator 286. As a result, the feedback information<br>
generator 286 creates feedback information including the transmission weights<br>
WR.K. Herein, the transmitter of the base station transmits the feedback information<br>
created from the feedback information generator 286. For example, such feedback<br>
information can be transmitted through a dedicated physical channel (DPCH).<br>
Even though only the operation of the first finger 280-1 has been<br>
described above as an example, other fingers may operate in the same manner as<br>
the first finger 280-1. Therefore, the multipath combiner 291 receives the signals<br>
output from the first to Lth fingers, combines the signals with each other through a<br>
multipath scheme, and outputs the signals to the de-interleaver 293. The cle-<br>
interleaver 293 receives the signals output from the multipath combiner 291, de-<br>
interleaves the signals through a predetermined de-interleaving method<br>
corresponding to the interleaving method used in the transmitter, and outputs the<br>
signals to the decoder 295. Upon receiving the signals from the de-interleaver 293,<br>
the decoder 295 decodes the signals through a decoding method corresponding to<br>
the encoding method used in the transmitter and outputs signals as final reception<br>
data.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a case in which the receiver of the base station calculates<br>
the transmission weights WR.K and transmits the transmission weights WR.K to the<br>
transmitter of the base station. However, the receiver and the transmitter of the<br>
base station can be used as the receiver and the transmitter of the mobile station.<br>
That is, it is noted that the above description has been made in view of creation<br>
and transmission of feedback information with reference to FIG. 2. Hereinafter,<br>
structures of a transmitter and a receiver of a mobile station of a CDMA mobile<br>
communication system performing functions according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating structures of the transmitter and the<br>
receiver of the mobile station of the CDMA mobile communication system<br>
performing functions according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
structures of the transmitter and the receiver of the mobile station performing<br>
functions illustrated in FIG. 3 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention are identical to the structures of the transmitter and the receiver<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1, except for a feedback information processor 307, which is<br>
newly added to FIG. 3, and an operation of a transmission beam generator 305,<br>
which creates a transmission beam by using feedback transmission weights.<br>
Prior to explaining FIG. 3, it is noted that the following description is<br>
made on the assumption that the CDMA mobile communication system utilizes<br>
the MIMO-AAA scheme. Accordingly, the transmitter and the receiver must have<br>
a plurality of transmission antennas and reception antennas, respectively.<br>
However, according to FIG. 3, the transmitter and the receiver do not individually<br>
have transmission antennas and reception antennas, but the same antennas are<br>
used for both transmitter and receiver through a time division scheme by using a<br>
duplexer. In addition, according to FIG. 3, N antennas are used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the transmitter includes an encoder 301, an<br>
interleaver 303, a transmission beam generator 305, a feedback information<br>
processor 307, a plurality of spreaders, including first to Nlh spreaders 311, 321,<br>
...., and 331, and N RF processors, including first to Nth RF processors 313,<br>
323,...., and 333. In addition, a duplexer 340 and N antennas, including first lo<br>
Nth antennas 341, 343,...., and 345, are commonly used for both transmitter and<br>
receiver. Herein, the structure and the operation of the encoder 301. the<br>
interleaver 303, the first to Nth spreaders 311, 321, ...., and 331, and the first to<br>
N RF processors 313, 323,...., and 333 are identical to the structure and the<br>
operation of the encoder 201, the interleaver 203, the first to Nth spreaders 211,<br>
221, ...., and 231, and the first to Nth RF processors 213, 223,...., and 233<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2. Therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted hero.<br>
The feedback information processor 307 analyzes feedback information<br>
received in the receiver of the mobile station in order to detect transmission<br>
weights WR.K included in the feedback information. In addition, the feedback<br>
information processor 307 sends the detected transmission weights WR.K to the<br>
transmission beam generator 305. A procedure of receiving feedback information<br>
in the receiver of the mobile station will be described in more detail later.<br>
Therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted for now.<br>
The transmission beam generator 305 creates a transmission beam<br>
corresponding to the transmission weights WR.K.<br>
The receiver includes N RF processors, including first to Nth RF<br>
processors 351, 361,...., and 371, N multipath searchers, including first to Nlh<br>
multipath searchers 353, 363,...., 373, which correspond to the RF processors, I.<br>
fingers, including first to Lth fingers 380-1, 380-2,...., 380-L, for processing<br>
signals regarding L multipaths, which are searched by the multipath searchers, a<br>
multipath combiner 391 for combining multipath signals output from the I.<br>
fingers, a de-interleaver 393, and a decoder 395. Herein, the structure and the<br>
operation of the first to Nth RF processors 351, 361,...., and 371, the first to N'1'<br>
multipath searchers 353, 363,...., 373, the first to Lth fingers 380-1, 380-2.....,<br>
380-L, the multipath combiner 391, the de-interleaver 393 and the decoder 395<br>
are identical to the structure and the operation of the first to Nth RF processors<br>
251, 261,...., and 271, the first to Nth multipath searchers 253, 263,...., 273, the<br>
first to Lth fingers 280-1, 280-2,...., 280-L, the multipath combiner 291, the de-<br>
interleaver 293 and the decoder 295 illustrated in FIG. 2. Therefore, a detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted here.<br>
Reception data finally output from the decoder 395 is feedback<br>
information including the transmission weights WR.K, and the feedback information<br>
output from the decoder 395 is input to the feedback information processor 307.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a case in which the receiver of the mobile, station<br>
receives the feedback information and the transmitter of the mobile station creates<br>
the transmission beam by using the transmission weights WR.K included in the<br>
feedback information. However, the receiver and the transmitter of the mobile<br>
station can be used as the receiver and the transmitter of the base station. That is,<br>
it is noted that the above description has been made in view of reception of the<br>
feedback information including the transmission weights WR.K with reference to<br>
FIG. 3. Hereinafter, the process in which the transmission weight information is<br>
generated and transmitted through the transmitter and receiver of the transmission<br>
side and the reception side according to the present invention will be described<br>
with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.<br>
The receiver illustrated in FIG. 2 calculates an error value of the received<br>
signal through the above-described process and determines the reception weight<br>
and the transmission weight using the error values obtained through the<br>
combinational method. The transmission weight is transmitted as feedback<br>
information data by the transmitter illustrated in FIG. 2 and is then received by the<br>
receiver illustrated in FIG. 3. The transmission weight received by the receiver<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 is input to the transmission beam generator of the transmitter<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 and serves as a transmission weight for creating a<br>
transmission beam for each antenna.<br>
As described above, the system illustrated in FIG. 2 may be a base station<br>
or a mobile station, and the system illustrated in FIG. 3 also may be a base station<br>
or a mobile station. That is, when the system illustrated in FIG. 2 is a base station,<br>
the base station calculates a transmission weight from data received by the base<br>
station and then transmits the transmission weight to a mobile station, and the<br>
mobile station reflects the received transmission weight in creation of a<br>
transmission beam for data transmission. Conversely, when the system illustrated<br>
in FIG. 2 is a mobile station, the mobile station calculates a transmission weight<br>
of data to be transmitted by a base station from data received by the mobile<br>
station and then transmits the transmission weight to the base station, and the base<br>
station reflects the received transmission weight in creation of a transmission<br>
beam for transmission of the data.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the structure of the signal processor<br>
performing functions according to the present invention. For convenience of<br>
explanation, only parts of the receiver of the base station that are in direct relation<br>
to the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 4. Because the<br>
above description has been made for a case in which the receiver of the base<br>
station calculates the transmission weights WR.K, the description of the signal<br>
processor illustrated in FIG. 4 will be made in relation to the parts of the receiver<br>
of the base station. However, the signal processor illustrated in FIG. 4 may be<br>
adaptable for the receiver of the mobile station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, when reception signals XK are input into the<br>
receiver at a predetermined point (k), the despreader 410 despreads the reception<br>
signals XK using a predetermined despreading code and outputs despread<br>
reception signals YK to the signal processor 430 and the reception beam<br>
generator 420. The signal processor 430 includes a weight calculator 431, a<br>
memory 433, and an error value combiner 435. For convenience of explanation,<br>
the signal processor 430 illustrated in FIG. 4 will be described in relation to the<br>
structure of the first finger 280-1 of the base station receiver illustrated in 1'KJ. 2.<br>
Therefore, although only one despreader 410 is illustrated in FIG. 4, the<br>
despreader 410 may perform an operation substantially identical to the operation<br>
of the first to Nth despreaders 281 to 283 of the first finger 280-1.<br>
The weight calculator 431 of the signal processor 430 receives the<br>
despread reception signals YK, calculates reception weights WR.K and<br>
transmission weights WT.K by applying a predetermined constant gain value<br>
u., initial weights WR.o and output signals zk of the first finger 280-1 output<br>
from the reception beam generator 420 to the despread reception signals YK,<br>
and outputs the calculated reception weights WR..K and transmission weights<br>
WT.K to the memory 433. The memory 433 performs a buffering operation for<br>
the reception weightsWR.K and transmission weights WT.K calculated by<br>
the weight calculator 431, and the weight calculator 431 may use the reception<br>
weights WR.K and transmission weights WT.K stored in the memory 433<br>
when updating the reception weights -WR.K and transmission weights WT.K.<br>
That is, the weight calculator 431 updates the reception weights WR.K and<br>
transmission weights WT.K at a next point (k+1) by using the reception weights<br>
— R-k and transmission weights WT.K calculated at a predetermined point k.<br>
The weight calculator 431 calculates the weights through a proper-<br>
combination of the CM scheme and the DD scheme. That is, the weight calculator<br>
431 calculates the reception weight WR.K and the transmission weight WT.K<br>
under the control of the error value combiner 435. The error value combiner 435<br>
determines the scheme according to which the weight calculator 431 must<br>
calculate the reception weight WT.K and the transmission weight WT.K.<br>
As described above, the CM scheme is defective in that it has a slow<br>
converging speed, and the DD scheme is defective in that it is highly probable for<br>
the DD scheme to fail to converge a signal in a high order modulation<br>
environment or a fast fading environment, such as a fast fading channel.<br>
Therefore, the present invention employs the error value combiner 435in order to<br>
combine the CM scheme and the DD scheme using a proper function (e.g,<br>
sigmoid function), thereby controlling signals to be converged into a relatively<br>
small MSE value. Therefore, differentiation of the CM scheme and the DD<br>
scheme is very important for improving performance.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a data transmitting and receiving<br>
procedure using the MIMO-AAA scheme according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, a base station 500 despreads reception<br>
signals in step 511, and calculates the reception weights WT.K and transmission<br>
weights WT.K by using the despread reception signals in step 513. In addition,<br>
the base station 500 creates feedback information including the transmission<br>
weightsWT.K and sends the feedback information to a mobile station 550 in<br>
step 515.<br>
The mobile station 550 receives the feedback information from the base-<br>
station 500 in step 551 and detects the transmission weights WT.K from the<br>
feedback information in step 553. In addition, the mobile station 550 creates a<br>
transmission beam by using the detected transmission weights WT.K in step<br>
555. Although FIG. 5 illustrates a case in which the base station 500 feeds the<br>
transmission weights WT.K to the mobile station 550 and the mobile station<br>
550 creates the transmission beam by using the transmission weights WT.K it<br>
is also possible to allow the mobile station 550 to feed the transmission weights<br>
WT.K to the base station 500 and allow the base station 500 to create the<br>
transmission beam by using the transmission weights WT.K. Therefore, as<br>
described above, the base station 500 and the mobile station 550 may exchange<br>
their functions. That is, the mobile station 550, instead of the base station 500,<br>
may despread the reception signal, calculate the transmission weight from the<br>
despread signal, and transmit the feedback information including the calculated<br>
transmission weight to the base station 500, and the base station 500 may receive<br>
the feedback information, detect the transmission weight from the feedback<br>
information, and generate the transmission beam.<br>
Hereinafter, a signal receiving procedure of a base station receiver<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 6. However, prior to giving description with reference to FIG. 6,<br>
because FIG. 2 illustrates a case in which the base station receiver creates the<br>
feedback information, the signal receiving procedure of the base station receiver<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 6. Herein, it is noted that the same signal<br>
receiving procedure may be realized even if the mobile station receiver creates<br>
the feedback information.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the signal receiving procedure of the<br>
base station receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, in step 611, the base station receiver sets up initial weights<br>
Wr,o, Wt,o and the constant gain value µ. In step 613, the base station<br>
receiver checks if communication has been completed. If communication has<br>
been completed, the base station receiver finishes the signal receiving procedure.<br>
However, when the communication has not been completed, in step 615, the base<br>
station receiver receives the despread signals Yk of the reception signals xk.<br>
In step 617, the base station receiver calculates Zk, which is a set of<br>
output signals zk output from each of the fingers provided in the base station<br>
receiver, by using the despread signals Yk and the reception weights WR.T<br>
( Zk = WK H Yk ) Herein, Zk is a set of the output signals of the fingers<br>
generated by the reception beam, which is created by using the reception weights<br>
In step 619, the base station receiver calculates the minimum error<br>
function ek =ak . ek CM+ßk . ek DD using the CM scheme and the DD scheme,.<br>
Here, the minimum error function ek is obtained by applying a weight of ak to the<br>
error value ekCM of the reception signal obtained through calculation using the CM<br>
scheme and applying a weight of ßk represents to the error value ekDD of the<br>
reception signal obtained through calculation using the CM scheme and then<br>
adding the weighted error values to each other, as described for Equation 27.<br>
In step 621, the base station receiver calculates a differential value of the<br>
cost function using the despread signals yk and the error function ek<br>
(?J( W.R.k)= -2e k Yk). In step 623, the base station receiver calculates a beam<br>
creation coefficient, that is, calculates the reception weight W.R.k and the<br>
transmission weights W.R.k ( W.R.k W.R.k )<br>
In step 625, the base station receiver transmits the calculated transmission<br>
weight W.T.k to a transmission terminal, i.e., the transmitter of the mobile<br>
station, and maintains the calculated reception weight W.R.k. In step 629, the<br>
base station receiver delays a predetermined unit time period set in advance. Here,<br>
the delay is intended to enable a value determined in the K-th time interval to be<br>
used in the (K+l)-th time interval, that is, to consider a state transition delay<br>
time. In step 631, the base station receiver increases the K value by 1, which<br>
means that the base station receiver shifts from the time point K to the time point<br>
(K+l), and then returns to step 613.<br>
According to the present invention, when calculating the error value in<br>
step 619, a combinational method in which two schemes, e.g., the CM scheme<br>
and the DD scheme, are combined is used and weights are differentially applied<br>
according to the sigmoid function. Further, in step 623, not only the reception<br>
weight W.R.k but also the transmission weight W.T.k are calculated, and the<br>
calculated transmission weight W.T.k is transmitted to the transmission terminal.<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating structures of the base station<br>
transmitter and the base station receiver of the mobile communication system<br>
performing functions according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
However, prior to describing FIG. 10, it is noted that the base station transmitter<br>
and the base station receiver illustrated in FIG. 10 may be operated in the<br>
substantially same manner as the base station transmitter and the base station<br>
receiver of the CDMA mobile communication system described with reference to<br>
FIG. 2 even though the structures of the base station transmitter and the base<br>
station receiver illustrated in FIG. 10 are different from the structures of the base<br>
station transmitter and the base station receiver illustrated in FIG. 2. That is,<br>
similarly to the base station transmitter and the base station receiver of the CDMA<br>
mobile communication system, the base station transmitter and the base station<br>
receiver of the OFDM mobile communication system can calculate the reception<br>
weights W.R.k and the transmission weights W.T.k and can transmit the<br>
calculated transmission weights W.R.k to the mobile station.<br>
In addition, it is also noted that the following description is made on the<br>
assumption that the OFDM mobile communication system utilizes the MIMO-<br>
AAA scheme. Accordingly, the transmitter and the receiver must have a plurality<br>
of transmission antennas and reception antennas, respectively. However,<br>
according to FIG. 10, the transmitter and the receiver do not individually have<br>
transmission antennas and reception antennas, but the same antennas are used for<br>
both transmitter and receiver through a time division scheme using a duplexer. In<br>
addition, according to FIG. 10, N antennas are used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the base station transmitter includes a symbol<br>
mapper 1011, a serial to parallel converter 1013, a pilot symbol inserter 1015, an<br>
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) unit 1017, a parallel to serial converter 1010,<br>
a guard interval inserter 1021, a transmission beam generator 1023, a signal<br>
processor 1022, a digital to analog converter 1025, and an RF processor 1027. In<br>
addition, a duplexer 1029 and N antennas, including first to Nth antennas 1031,<br>
1033,...., and 1035, are commonly used for both base station transmitter and base<br>
station receiver.<br>
If information data bits to be transmitted are created, that is, if feedback<br>
information data including the transmission weights W.R.k is created, the feedback<br>
information data is input into the symbol mapper 1011. Upon receiving the<br>
feedback information data, the symbol mapper 1011 modulates the feedback<br>
information data through a predetermined modulation method in order to achieve<br>
symbol transform with respect to the feedback information data and outputs serial<br>
modulation symbols to the serial to parallel converter 1013. The predetermined<br>
modulation method may include QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying) method or<br>
16QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) method. Upon receiving the serial<br>
modulation symbols from the symbol mapper 1011, the serial to parallel converter<br>
1013 converts the serial modulation symbols into parallel modulation symbols<br>
and outputs the parallel modulation symbols to the pilot symbol inserter 1015.<br>
The pilot symbol inserter 1015 inserts pilot symbols into the parallel modulation<br>
symbols output from the serial to parallel converter 1013 and outputs the parallel<br>
modulation symbols having the pilot symbols to the IFFT unit 1017.<br>
Upon receiving the signal from the pilot symbol inserter 1015, the IFFT<br>
unit 1017 performs N-point IFFT with respect to the signal and outputs the signal<br>
to the parallel to serial converter 1019. Therefore, the parallel to serial converter<br>
1019 receives the signal output from the IFFT unit 1017, converts the parallel<br>
signal to a serial signal, and outputs the serial signal to the guard interval inserter<br>
1021. Upon receiving the serial signal from the parallel to serial converter 1010.<br>
the guard interval inserter 1021 inserts a guard interval signal into the serial signal,<br>
and outputs the signal including the guard interval signal to the signal processor<br>
1022. Therefore, the signal processor 1022 calculates a weight based on the signal<br>
output from the guard interval inserter 1021 and outputs the signal to the<br>
transmission beam generator 1023.<br>
The transmission beam generator 1023 generates a transmission beam<br>
based on the signal output from the guard interval inserter 1021 and the weight<br>
calculated in the signal processor 1022 and outputs the transmission beam to the<br>
digital to analog converter 1025 such that the transmission beam can he<br>
transmitted to each of the first to Nth antennas 1031, 1033,...., and 1035. The<br>
transmission beam generator 1023 may create the transmission beam by<br>
separately calculating the weights for the transmission beam. However, a detailed<br>
procedure of creating the transmission beam does not directly relate to the present<br>
invention; therefore, it will not be further described below.<br>
If the base station receiver has previously received the feedback<br>
information data from the mobile station transmitter, the transmission beam<br>
generator 1023 may create the transmission beam by using the transmission<br>
weight W.T.k included in the feedback information data.<br>
In addition, a guard interval must be inserted into the signal to be<br>
transmitted in order to prevent interference between previous OFDM symbols<br>
transmitted at a previous OFDM symbol transmission time and present OFDM<br>
symbols to be transmitted at a present OFDM symbol transmission time, when<br>
transmitting the OFDM symbols in the OFDM mobile communication system.<br>
The guard interval may be inserted into the signal through a "cyclic prefix"<br>
method in which predetermined aft samples of the OFDM symbols provided in a<br>
time region are copied in order to be inserted into an effective OFDM symbol, or<br>
through a "cyclic postfix" method in which predetermined samples of the OFDM<br>
symbols provided in the time region are copied in order to be inserted into the<br>
effective OFDM symbol.<br>
The digital to analog converter 1025 receives the signal output from the<br>
transmission beam generator 1023 in order to convert the signal into an analog<br>
signal, and outputs the analog signal to the RF processor 1027. The RF processor<br>
1027 may include a filter and a front end unit in order to perform an RF-treatment<br>
process with respect to the signal output from the digital to analog converter 1025<br>
in such a manner that the signal can be transmitted through the air. The RF<br>
processor 1027 outputs the signal to the duplexer 1029. Therefore, the duplexer<br>
1029 receives the signal from the RF processor 1027 and transmits the signal via<br>
the antennas at a corresponding signal transmission time.<br>
The base station receiver includes the duplexer 1029, an RF processor<br>
1037, an analog to digital (A/D) converter 1039, a reception beam generator 1041,<br>
a signal processor 1043, a guard interval remover 1047, a serial to parallel<br>
converter 1049, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) unit 1051, a pilot symbol extractor<br>
1053, a synchronization &amp; channel estimator 1055, an equalizer 1057, a parallel<br>
to serial converter 1059, and a symbol demapper 1061.<br>
The signal transmitted from the mobile station transmitter is received in<br>
the base station receiver through antennas of the base station receiver while<br>
passing through a multipath channel at which noise is added to (he signal. Tin-<br>
signal received in the base station receiver through the antennas is input into the<br>
duplexer 1029. The duplexer 1029 outputs the signal, which has been received in<br>
the base station receiver through the antennas at a corresponding signal receiving<br>
time, to the RF processor 1037.<br>
Upon receiving the signal from the duplexer 1029, the RF processor 1037<br>
down-converts the signal such that the signal has an intermediate frequency band<br>
and outputs the down-converted signal to the analog to digital converter 1039.<br>
Therefore, the analog to digital converter 1039 converts the analog signal output<br>
from the RF processor 1037 into a digital signal and outputs the digital signal to<br>
the reception beam generator 1041 and the signal processor 1043. Upon receiving<br>
the signal from the analog to digital converter 1039, the signal processor 1043<br>
calculates the reception weights W.R.k, and then, calculates the transmission<br>
weights W.T.k by using the reception weights W.R.k.<br>
Thereafter, the signal processor 1043 outputs the transmission weights<br>
W.T.k to the feedback information generator 1045. As a result, the feedback<br>
information generator 1045 creates feedback information including the<br>
transmission weights W.T.k. The feedback information created from the feedback<br>
information generator 1045 is transmitted from the base station transmitter. For<br>
example, such feedback information can be transmitted through a dedicated<br>
physical channel.<br>
The signal output from the reception beam generator 1041 is input into<br>
the guard interval remover 1047. That is, the guard interval remover 1047<br>
receives the signal from the reception beam generator 1041 in order to remove the<br>
guard interval signal. Thereafter, the guard interval remover 1047 outputs the<br>
signal to the serial to parallel converter 1049. The serial to parallel converter 1040<br>
converts the serial signal output from the guard interval remover 1047 into the<br>
parallel signal and outputs the parallel signal to the FFT unit 1051.<br>
Upon receiving the parallel signal from the guard interval remover 1047,<br>
the IFFT unit 1047 performs N-point IFFT with respect to the parallel signal and<br>
outputs the signal to the equalizer 1057 and the pilot symbol extractor 1053. The<br>
equalizer 1057 receives the signal output from the IFFT unit 1047 and performs a<br>
channel equalization with respect to the signal.<br>
After the channel equalization has been completed, the equalizer 1057<br>
outputs the signal to the parallel to serial converter 1059. The parallel to serial<br>
converter 1059 receives the parallel signal from the equalizer 1057 and converts<br>
the parallel signal into the serial signal. The parallel to serial converter 1050<br>
outputs the serial signal to the symbol demapper 1061. Upon receiving the signal<br>
from the parallel to serial converter 1059, the demapper 1061 demodulates the<br>
signal through a predetermined demodulation method corresponding to the<br>
modulation method applied to the mobile station transmitter, thereby outputting<br>
reception information data bits.<br>
In addition, the signal output from the FFT unit 1051 is input into the<br>
pilot symbol extractor 1053. The pilot symbol extractor 1053 detects pilot<br>
symbols from the signal output from the FFT unit 1051 and outputs the detected<br>
pilot symbols to the synchronization &amp; channel estimator 1055. In addition, the<br>
synchronization &amp; channel estimator 1055 performs synchronization and channel<br>
estimation by using the pilot symbols output from the pilot symbol extractor 1053<br>
and outputs data thereof to the equalizer 1057.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a case in which the base station receiver calculates the<br>
transmission weights W.T.k and transmits the transmission weights W.R.k to the base<br>
station transmitter. However, the base station receiver and the base station<br>
transmitter can be used as the mobile station receiver and the mobile station<br>
transmitter, respectively. That is, it is noted that the above description has been<br>
made in view of creation and transmission of feedback information with reference<br>
to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating structures of the mobile station<br>
transmitter and the mobile station receiver of the OFDM mobile communication<br>
system performing functions according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
However, prior to describing FIG. 11, it is noted that the following description is<br>
made on the assumption that the OFDM mobile communication system utilizes<br>
the MIMO-AAA scheme. Accordingly, the transmitter and the receiver must have<br>
a plurality of transmission antennas and reception antennas, respectively.<br>
However, according to FIG. 11, the transmitter and the receiver do not<br>
individually have transmission antennas and reception antennas, but the same<br>
antennas are used for both transmitter and receiver through a time division<br>
scheme by using a duplexer. In addition, according to FIG. 11, N antennas are<br>
used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the mobile station transmitter includes a symbol<br>
mapper 1111, a serial to parallel converter 1113, a pilot symbol inserter 1115, an<br>
IFFT unit 1117, a parallel to serial converter 1119, a guard interval inserter 1121,<br>
a transmission beam generator 1123, a feedback information processor 1125, a<br>
digital to analog converter 1127, and an RF processor 1129. In addition, a<br>
duplexer 1131 and N antennas, including first to N1'1 antennas 1133, 1135....., and<br>
1137, are commonly used for both mobile station transmitter and mobile station<br>
receiver.<br>
The operation and the structure of the symbol mapper 1111, the serial to<br>
parallel converter 1113, the pilot symbol inserter 1115, the IFFT unit 1117, the<br>
parallel to serial converter 1119, the guard interval inserter 1121, the transmission<br>
beam generator 1123, the digital to analog converter 1127, the RF processor 1129,<br>
and the duplexer 1131 are identical to the operation and the structure of the<br>
symbol mapper 1011, the serial to parallel converter 1013, the pilot symbol<br>
inserter 1015, the IFFT unit 1017, the parallel to serial converter 1019, the guard<br>
interval inserter 1021, the transmission beam generator 1023, the digital to analog<br>
converter 1025, the RF processor 1027 and the duplexer 1029 illustrated in FIG.<br>
10. Therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.<br>
The feedback information processor 1125 analyzes feedback information<br>
received in the mobile station receiver in order to detect transmission weights<br>
included in the feedback information. In addition, the feedback information<br>
processor 1125 sends the detected transmission weights W.R.k to the transmission<br>
beam generator 1123. A procedure of receiving feedback information in the<br>
mobile station receiver will be described in detail later. Therefore, a detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted now. The transmission beam generator 1123<br>
creates the transmission beam corresponding to the transmission weights W.R.k.<br>
The mobile station receiver includes an RF processor 1139, an analog to<br>
digital converter 1141, a reception beam generator 1143, a signal processor 1145,<br>
a guard interval remover 1147, a serial to parallel converter 1149, an FFT unit<br>
1151, a pilot symbol extractor 1153, a synchronization &amp; channel estimator 11 55,<br>
an equalizer 1157, a parallel to serial converter 1159, and a symbol demapper<br>
1161. The operation and the structure of the RF processor 1139, the analog to<br>
digital converter 1141, the reception beam generator 1143, the signal processor<br>
1145, the guard interval remover 1147, the serial to parallel converter 1149, the<br>
FFT unit 1151, the pilot symbol extractor 1153, the synchronization &amp; channel<br>
estimator 1155, the equalizer 1157, the parallel to serial converter 1159, and the<br>
symbol demapper 1161 are identical to the operation and the structure of the RF<br>
processor 1037, the analog to digital converter 1039, the reception beam<br>
generator 1041, the signal processor 1043, the guard interval remover 1047, the<br>
serial to parallel converter 1049, the FFT unit 1051, the pilot symbol extractor<br>
1053, the synchronization &amp; channel estimator 1055, the equalizer 1057, the<br>
parallel to serial converter 1059, and the symbol demapper 1061 illustrated in F!(i.<br>
10. Therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
Herein, reception data finally output from the symbol demapper 1161 are<br>
feedback information including the transmission weights W.T.k, and the feedback<br>
information output from the symbol demapper 1161 is input to the feedback<br>
information processor 1125.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a case in which the mobile station receiver receives the<br>
feedback information and the mobile station transmitter creates the transmission<br>
beam by using the transmission weights W.T.k included in the feedback information.<br>
However, the mobile station receiver and the mobile station transmitter can be<br>
used as the base station receiver and the base station transmitter. That is, it is<br>
noted that the above description has been made in view of reception of the<br>
feedback information including the transmission weights -" with reference to<br>
FIG. 11.<br>
FIG. 12 is a graph illustrating a characteristic curve of the combination-<br>
type weight creation method of the present invention according the number of<br>
reception antennas of the base station. More specifically, FIG. 12 illustrates<br>
radiation patterns represented when six reception antennas or ten reception<br>
antennas are provided in the base station receiver. For example, if a<br>
predetermined mobile station is positioned at a point of 57°, a normalized antenna<br>
gain may increase by 0.2 when providing ten antennas in the base station receiver,<br>
as compared with a case in which six antennas are provided in the base station<br>
receiver.<br>
In addition, it is possible to precisely create the reception beam when<br>
providing ten antennas in the base station receiver. In view of system capacity of<br>
the mobile communication system, intensity of the reception signal can be greatly<br>
amplified as the number of the reception antennas increases, such that it is<br>
possible to precisely provide communication services and to increase the system<br>
capacity.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the weights can<br>
be created through the combination-mode weight creation method, in which the<br>
weights are differentially applied to two combined schemes, e.g., the CM scheme<br>
and the DD scheme, through a sigmoid function, thereby more rapidly creating<br>
the weights having a minimum MSE value than in a method using either only one<br>
scheme or two converted schemes. Accordingly, it is possible to precisely create<br>
the reception beam, such that the receiver can receive only desired signals and the<br>
system performance is improved.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the transmission weights<br>
created in the receiver using the reception weights can be fedback to the<br>
transmitter, such that the transmitter also can use the transmission weighis.<br>
Accordingly, it is not necessary for the transmitter to perform a separate process<br>
for calculating the transmission weight, so that an operation load of the<br>
calculation of the transmission weight can be reduced.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
appended claims.<br>
