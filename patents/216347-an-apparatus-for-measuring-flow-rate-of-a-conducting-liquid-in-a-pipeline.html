				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus for measuring flow rate of a conducting<br>
fluid through a pipeline More particularly this invention pertains to a system for flow<br>
measurement of a conducting liquid by using plurality of electrodes attached to a pipeline<br>
through which the liquid flows. These electrodes are usually placed in a pipeline at diametrical<br>
distance apart from each other.<br>
Previously, for measuring the volume flow rate for a liquid different types of measuring<br>
instruments were used such as, for instance obstruction type, target type, vortex type, coriolis<br>
force type and so on. However for conducting liquid flow measurement, electromagnetic flow<br>
measurement technique has been found to be much more easier and less costly in comparison to<br>
the other flow measuring instruments stated earlier. Tn this technique, an intense magnetic field<br>
is produced in selected region of a flow tube by means of two coils excited from an AC or a<br>
DC source. Two sensing electrodes are placed in diametrically opposite positions inside the<br>
tube in physical contact with the flowing liquid. The magnetic field induces an e.m.f. in the<br>
liquid between the electrodes which is directly proportional to the flow. Most of the<br>
conventional equipment are costly, power intensive and require close surveillance.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for measuring<br>
rate of flow of a conducting liquid which does not require any excitation coil,<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus capable of generating<br>
signals, which are easily readable.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus that is cost effective and<br>
can be made from indigenously available raw materials and electronic components.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an apparatus, which is compact and can be<br>
easily transported to work site, the only requirement being the availability or proximity of an<br>
A.C. power source.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention pertaining to an apparatus<br>
for measuring flow rate of a conducting liquid in a pipeline comprising in combination-<br>
(a) A flow head consisting of a uniform pipe section made of insulating material like fiber<br>
glass, PVC, hard plastic, nylon etc. fitted with end flanges;<br>
(b) a plurality of electrodes made of metals or alloys chemically inert to the flowing liquid<br>
mounted on the flow head made of insulating material and connected to a stabilised<br>
sinusoidal AC. source with constant amplitude and frequency and<br>
(c) a signal conditioner with a linearisation unit.<br>
The subject of invention relates to an apparatus, for measuring flow rate of a conducting<br>
liquid in a pipeline comprising -<br>
(a) a plurality of electrodes A,B,C and D made of metal or alloy chemically inert to the<br>
flowing liquid mounted on the flow head and connected to an AC. power source (E);<br>
(b) recesses with close tolerance and situated diametrically opposite to each other for<br>
insertion of the said electrodes ;<br>
(c) a signal conditioner (F) to amplify, rectify and filter the AC. signal obtained from<br>
step (a);<br>
(d) a lineariser (G) which linearises the output of the signal conditioner and display the<br>
flowrate of the liquid in liter/minute as well gives rise to an output which linearly varies<br>
with flowrate, characterised in that the electrodes are held in place by terminal<br>
screws (l) connected to metallic probes (2) mounted on flow tube (3),<br>
which carry flanges (4) at predetermined locations.<br>
The apparatus of this invention employs two pairs of identical metal electrodes inserted<br>
into the selected zone of the flow head which are in physical contact with the flowing liquid<br>
in such a way that they cause no obstruction to the flow. The electrodes are placed in the<br>
same horizontal axial plane of the horizontal pipe with each pair in diametrically opposite<br>
locations. The distance between the pairs along the pipeline is equal to the diameter of the<br>
pipe. The system of electrodes is excited by an AC, source and the output voltage has been<br>
found to be linearly related with flow under streamline condition and has a small non-linear<br>
zone under turbulent condition. This output voltage may be concerted to a DC. voltage<br>
signal by using a conventional signal conditioner. The non-linear zone is linearised by using<br>
a conventional linearisation unit.. The experimental data have been found to substantially<br>
conform to the theoretical equations discussed hereafter.<br>
THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS:<br>
The measurement of volume flow rate of a conducting liquid is generally done in the<br>
process industries by using electromagnetic flow meters since this technique is very simple<br>
compared to the other methods. There are other techniques of this flow measurement like<br>
absorption type, turbine type, coriolis force type, target type, vortex type, etc. But for the<br>
conducting liquid flow measurement, the electromagnetic flow measurement technique is much<br>
easier and less costly compared to the other measurements. In this technique an intense<br>
magnetic field is produced in the selected region of the flow tube by means of two coils excited<br>
from an AC. or a DC. source. Two sensing electrodes are placed on the diametrically opposite<br>
positions inside the tube in contact with the flowing liquid. The flowing liquid induces an e.m.f<br>
between the electrodes which is directly proportional to the flow. In the present instance, a<br>
novel technique of measurement of flow of a conducting liquid has been described. In this<br>
technique no excitation coil is required. This technique consists of four metal electrodes<br>
inserted into the selected zone of the flow which are always in contact with the liquid and<br>
produce no obstruction to the liquid flow. This electrode system is excited from an AC source<br>
with constant amplitude and frequency and the output signal has been found to be linearly<br>
related with the liquid flow under streamline condition along with a small non-linear zone at<br>
turbulent condition. This output voltage has been converted into a D.C. signal in the range 1-5<br>
volts by using a signal conditioner and the non-linear zone is linearised by a linearisation unit.<br>
The design of the flow head and the calibration data before and after linearisation are reported<br>
here as an example. The experimental data are almost found to conform to the theoritical<br>
equations.<br>
When two metal electrodes are immersed in a conducting liquid the polarisation effect at<br>
each electrode produces an electric double layer at the metal liquid interface across which there<br>
exists a difference in potential along with a polarisation impedance. If a very small value of<br>
sinusoidal voltage signal be applied across the electrodes then this ac voltage signal is<br>
superimposed with the half cell potential at each electrode and accordingly the flow of ions<br>
from one electrode to the other occurs. The electric current due to this flow ions may be<br>
opposed by the DC. polarisation impedance and the ohmic impedance of the liquid between the<br>
two electrodes. Again if there is a flow of liquid from one electrode to the other then the flow of<br>
a liquid element along with the ions may be opposed by the viscous effect of the liquid<br>
produced by the velocity gradient. Hence the net impedance between the electrodes defined as<br>
the ratio of the supply voltage to the current may be assumed to be dependent on the electrode<br>
polarisation effect, ohomic effect and the velocity gradient of the liquid. The D.C. polarisation<br>
effect non-linearly depends on the electric current density and frequency of excitation and<br>
ohmic effect may be assumed constant for a particular system. When a liquid flows through a<br>
pipe line there exists a velocity gradient across the cross section of the pipe line which depends<br>
on the flow rate of the liquid if the polarisation effect and ohmic effect are assumed to be<br>
constant. In the present application the effect of four electrodes inserted into a conducting<br>
liquid flowing through the pipe line with proper insulation at the diametrically opposite<br>
positions has been studied. Since an impedance is always found to exist between any two of<br>
these electrodes, the four electrodes may be assumed to be equivalent to four lumped<br>
impedances as shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
When a conducting liquid flows through the horizontal pipe under the streamline<br>
condition it may be assumed to have no component of its velocity along any diameter since it is<br>
perpendicular to the length of the pipe line. Hence the lumped parameter impedance Z1, between<br>
the diametrically opposite electrodes A &amp; C and Z3 between the similar electrodes B &amp; D may<br>
remain constant but the effective lumped impedance Z2 between A &amp; B or Z4 between C&amp; D<br>
tends to change due to the velocity gradient among the liquid layers between the electrodes.<br>
Hence if any two diagonally opposite electrodes be supplied from a very small value sinusoidal<br>
stabilised AC. source then the output across the other two electrodes may change due to the<br>
flow of the conducting liquid following the Wheatstone"s bridge network principle. So for a<br>
small value of supply voltage Vs at a fixed frequency applied between B and C and for a very<br>
high input impedance of the measuring circuit the bridge output voltage signal Vo between A &amp;<br>
D may be given by<br>
Vo=VS(Z2Z4 -Z1Z3)./(Z1+Z4)(Z2 + Z3) (1)<br>
For a very small value of AC. voltage VS and for the identical electrodes Z1 - Z3 and Z2 -<br>
Z4.<br>
Let at any flow rate Qo of the liquid Z1 - Z3 = ZC , Z2 = Z4 =ZO and at any other flow<br>
rate Q slightly different from Qo the value of ZO changes to Zq. Hence the Taylor series<br>
expansion of Zq may be given by<br>
ZQ = ZO +(dZq/dQ)Qo ?Q + (d2ZQ/dQ2)Qo ? Q2 +.......... (2)<br>
where AQ = Q - Qo<br>
Let (dZq/dQ)Qo= µ and (d2ZQ/dQ2)Qo = b<br>
Hence Zq = ZO + µ ?Q + b ?Q2 +............... (3)<br>
Under streamline conditions, the value of b and the co- efficients of higher order terms may be<br>
assumed to be very small. Hence for a very small change (?Q) of flow rate, Zq may be given<br>
by<br>
Zq = ZO + µ ?Q (4)<br>
Hence putting Z1 — Z3 = ZC and Z2 = Z4 = Zq in equation no. (1) the bridge output voltage for<br>
a liquid flowrate Q is given by<br>
Vo = VS[(Zq-Zc)/(Zc + Zq)] (5)<br>
From the equation nos (4) and (5) we get<br>
Vo = VS[(ZO+ µ ?Q-ZC)/(ZC +ZO+ µ ?Q)]<br>
or<br>
Vo = VS[(ZO+ µ ?Q -ZC)/(ZC + ZO )(1+ µ ?Q)(ZC + ZO)<br>
Or,<br>
Vo = VS[(ZO+ µ ?Q -ZC)/(ZC + ZO )][(1+ µ ?Q)(ZC + ZO)]-1<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS[(ZO+ µ ?Q -ZC)/(ZC+ZO)][(1- µ ?Q(ZC + ZO)]<br>
[ since µ ?Q/( Zq + Zq) « 1]<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS{l/(ZC+ZO )}[(ZO+ µ ?Q -ZC)/(ZC+ZO)][(1- µ ?Q(ZC + ZO)]<br>
Or<br>
VO = VS{l/(ZC + ZO )}[( ZO-ZC)+ µ ?Q -ZC)/(ZO+ZC)] µ ?Q(ZC + ZO)}<br>
- µ2 ?Q2/( ZC + ZO)]<br>
VO = {1/ (ZC +ZO )} [ (ZO - ZC) +{2ZC / ( ZO+ ZC)} µ ?Q ] VS - [µ2 ?q2 / (ZC+ZO)2] VS<br>
or<br>
VO = K1+K2 ?Q + K3 ?Q2 (6)<br>
where K1 =[ (ZO - ZC) / (ZO + ZC)] VS (7)<br>
K2 = [2µ ZC /(ZO + ZC)2]VS (8)<br>
K3= [µ 2/(ZC+ZO)2]VS (9)<br>
Under the streamline conditions, the term K3 = [µ2 / (Zc+ZO)2]VS may be assumed to<br>
be very small and hence for a very small change ?Q of flow rate, the equation no. (6) may be<br>
written as<br>
VO = K1 + K2 ?Q<br>
or<br>
VO=K1+K2(Q-QO) (11)<br>
Hence the bridge output voltage is linearly related with the incremental change in flow rate<br>
under the stream line condition. Under no flow condition Qq - 0 and for electrode separation<br>
along the pipe line equal to the pipe diameter, Zo = Zc , Hence K1 = 0 and the equation no.<br>
(11) is reduced to<br>
VO = K2Q (12)<br>
Thus the bridge output voltage is linearly related with flow rate when the flow rate is very small<br>
and streamline.<br>
Under the turbulent condition, the equation no. (3) may be given as<br>
Zq-Zq +µ ?Q +b ?Q2<br>
Hence from equation (5) the bridge output voltage is given by<br>
Vo = VS[(Zq-Zc)/(Zc+Zq)]<br>
Or,<br>
VO = [(ZO + µ ?Q +b ?Q2 -Zc)/(ZO + µ ?Q + b ?Q2 +ZC)]Vs (13)<br>
So under turbulent condition, the bridge output voltage may be non linearly related with the<br>
incremental change of flow rate. But Zq+ Zq » µ ?Q + b ?Q2 for very small of ?Q.. So<br>
the bridge output voltage under turbulent condition may be given from equation no. (13) by the<br>
following equation.<br>
vo = [(Zo-zc +µ ?Q +b ?Q2 )/[(ZO + Zc) [1+(µ ?Q + b ?Q2 )./(zO+zc ) ] vS<br>
Or<br>
VO = VS[(Zo-Zc + µ ?Q +b ?Q2)/(ZO + ZC)]+(µ ?Q +b ?Q2 )./(Zo+Zc ) ]-1<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS[(ZO-Zc + µ ?Q +b ?Q2)/(ZO + Zc)][1-(µ ?Q +b ?Q2)./(ZO+Zc ) ]<br>
[ Since ZO+Zc » µ ?Q +b ?Q2]<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS{1/(ZO + ZC)}[(ZO-ZC + µ ?Q + b ?Q2 )][1-(µ ?Q + b ?Q2)./(Zo+Zc)]<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS { 1/ (ZO + ZC ) } [(ZO - ZC + µ ?Q + b ?Q2)] [ 1- (µ ?Q + b ?Q2 )./ (ZO+ ZC )]<br>
Or,<br>
Vo = VS{1/(ZO + ZC)}[(ZO-ZC +µ ?Q + b ?Q2)<br>
- (ZO-ZC)(µ ?Q + b ?Q2)./(ZO+ZC)-(µ ?Q + b ?Q2)2/(ZO+ZC)]<br>
or,<br>
VO = Vs{1/(Zo + Zc)}[(Zo-ZC + µ ?Q + b ?Q2)<br>
 (ZO -ZC) µ ?Q /(ZO+ZC) - (ZO-ZC) b ?Q2)./(ZO+ZC)<br>
- µ2 ?Q2 /(ZO+ ZC )-2 µb ?Q3 /(ZO+ Zc ) b2 ?Q4 /(Zo+ Zc )]<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS{1/(ZO + ZC)}[(ZO - ZC + µ ?Q{l-(ZO-ZC)/(ZO+ZC)}<br>
+ [b { 1 - ( ZO - ZC) /(ZO+ ZC )} -µ2/(ZO+ ZC )]?Q2<br>
- 2 µb ?Q3 /(ZO+ ZC )-b2 ?Q4) /(ZO+ ZC )]<br>
Or,<br>
VO = VS [{ZO- ZC )/(ZO+ ZC)] +[{2µZC/(ZO+ ZC)2}VS]?Q<br>
+ [{(2ZCb- µ2)/(ZO+ ZC)2}VS]?Q2 - [{2µ b/( ZO+ ZC)2 } Vs ]?Q3<br>
-[{b2 /(ZO + ZC)2}VS]?Q4<br>
Or,<br>
VO = K1+K2?Q +K3 ?Q2-K4?Q3- K5 ?Q4 (14)<br>
where K1 =[ (ZO - ZC) / (ZO + ZC)] VS<br>
K2 = [2µZC/(Zo + ZC)2]VS<br>
K3 = [(2ZC b - µ2 ) / (ZO + ZC )2 ] VS (15)<br>
K4 =[2µb/(ZO+ ZC)2]VS (16)<br>
K5 =[b2/(ZO+Zc)2]VS (17)<br>
Since µ and b are small so K4 and K5 may be negligible and hence the above equation no.<br>
(14) may be written as<br>
VO = K2 + K2 ?Q + K3 ? Q2 (18)<br>
Hence the relation between the bridge output voltage and the incremental change of flow rate<br>
may be assumed to be parabolic under some conditions of turbulent flow. Starting from an<br>
initial flow rate Qo, if the flow rate be changed by a small value to Q in the turbulent region<br>
then the above (18) is reduced to<br>
Vo = K1 + K2 (Q-Qo) + K3 (Q- Qo) 2 (19)<br>

The present invention will be further described by means of the following example, which is<br>
given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The design of the flow head is very simple as shown in Fig.2 of the drawings. It<br>
involves only the selection of the electrode material that should be chemically inert to the<br>
flowing liquid. In the present design, the flow rate of water through a one-inch pipeline has<br>
been measured. The electrode material is selected to be stainless steel. Since the outside and<br>
inside diameters of the pipe are 25mm and 20 mm respectively so the length of each electrode is<br>
selected to be 15 mm with 2 mm insertion depth. The diameter of each electrode is selected to<br>
be 4 mm. These selections are made so that the obstruction to the flow is minimum. Each<br>
electrode is covered with PVC sleeve and is fitted with a 2-mm terminal screw, Each electrode<br>
is then mounted on the flow head along its line of symmetry through a proper hole so that the<br>
electrode may be inserted with tight fitting condition and there is no water leakage at the<br>
operating pressure. The small gap, if any, is sealed with Araldite. The length of the flow head is<br>
selected to be one meter with flange connections at both ends of internal diameter exactly equal<br>
to that of the pipe line. The flow head is connected with the pipe line through insulating gasket<br>
of Teflon sheet.<br>
The lumped parameter bridge circuit formed by the four electrodes as shown in Fig.(l),<br>
is supplied from a stabilised sinusoidal oscillator at 5V, 1000 Hz. Any two diagonal electrodes<br>
are taken as the bridge supply nodal points and the other two diagonal electrodes as the bridge<br>
output nodal points. The bridge output voltage signal is converted into 1-5 Volt dc signal by the<br>
signal conditioner. This signal is linearised by using the conventional lineariser unit as shown in<br>
the block diagram.<br>
The experiment is performed using tap water with the experimental set up as shown in<br>
Fig.4 of the drawings. The flow through the pipe line is increased in small steps and in each step<br>
the signal conditioner output and the lineariser output are noted in both increasing and<br>
decreasing modes. The static calibration graphs obtained from the experiment for the signal<br>
conditioner output and lineariser output are as shown in Fig.4 of the drawings.<br>
DISCUSSIONS<br>
The repeatability and reproducibility of the experimental data in the increasing and<br>
decreasing modes were found to be satisfactory.The calibration graph shown in Fig.5 of the<br>
drawing reveals that the nature of the graph is linear over large portion of the operating zone.<br>
The non-linearity may be due to the turbulence effect of flow The nature of the graph appears<br>
to follow the theoretically derived equations (II) and (18). The technique is very simple and<br>
requires no magnetic excitation field coils as in the case of an electromagnetic flow meter and<br>
hence it is very low cost.<br>
From the foregoing it may be seen that the invented apparatus and its mode of operation<br>
are quite simple and requires no magnetic excitation field coils as in the case of an<br>
electromagnetic flow meter. This renders the apparatus versatile, easy to operate and cost<br>
effective. Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus the particular combination of parts described and<br>
illustrated herein is intended to represent only one embodiment of present invention and is not<br>
intended to serve as limitations of alternative devices within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

(e)a plurality of electrodes A,B,C and D made of metal or alloy chemically inert to the<br>
flowing liquid mounted on the flow head and connected to an A.C. power source (E);<br>
(f)	recesses with close tolerance and situated diametrically opposite to each other for<br>
insertion of the said electrodes ;<br>
(g)	a signal conditioner (F) to amplify, rectify and filter the A.C. signal obtained from<br>
step (a);<br>
(h) a lineariser (G) which linearises the output of the signal conditioner and display the<br>
flowrate of the liquid in liter/minute as well gives rise to an output which linearly varies<br>
with flowrate,<br>
characterised in that the electrodes are held in place by terminal screws(1) connected to<br>
metallic probes (2) mounted on flow tube(3), which carry flanges (4) at predetermined<br>
locations.</td>
