TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
FABRIC TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINOUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br><br><br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in<br>
which it is to,be performed)	<br><br><br>
FABRIC TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to fabric treatment compositions, to their use in the treatment of fabric and to a method of treating fabric with the compositions.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
It is known that the physical properties of fabrics can be modified by certain treatments.  For example, fabric may be treated in order to modify its physical properties either in an industrial pretreatment or during laundering.<br>
Fabrics in general, and cotton in particular, are prone to the formation of creases before, during and after laundering and drying.  In order to remove such creases from the fabric,, a considerable amount of time, and .effort must be spent ironing upon each occasion of laundering and drying. The terms "crease" and "wrinkle" and related terms, such as "anti-crease" and "anti-wrinkle", refer to non-permanent deformations in the fabric which can be removed by flattening at elevated temperature and moisture (eg, by ironing) and are used synonymously herein.<br>
Some of the previous attempts to address the problems of crease formation with regard to fabrics have been based on the use of insoluble particulate materials.<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
US 3,892,681, for example, discloses the use of granular, substantially water-insoluble starch particles having a diameter between 1 to 45:m in detergent compositions.  Such particles are said to impart anti-wrinkling and ease of ironing benefits in addition to other fabric .conditioning properties.<br>
A detergent composition featuring a substantially water-insoluble particulate material with a diameter from about 5 to 30 :m is described in US 4,051,046.  The particulate material may be a glass, ceramic or polymer-based bead, or a starch that has been treated with a hydrophobic agent to reduce its water solubility.  In order to permit ironing, the particles must have a melting point above 150"C.  These compositions are said to confer a range of "fabric benefits, including anti-wrinkling and ease of ironing.<br>
The use of smectite clay as a softening agent is disclosed in US 3,936,537.  In this document, the clay is combined with a quaternary ammonium salt, which confers anti-static benefits, and a dispersion inhibitor consisting. of a solid, organic material, in a detergent compatible composition.<br>
Smectite clay is also used in the fabric-softening detergent compositions disclosed in US 4,062,647. Again the clay is said to impart improved softening and/or antistatic characteristics.<br>
A fabric softening detergent composition comprising a synthetic non-soap detergent, builder salt and clay is disclosed in GB 14008 98. The clay, added for softening<br><br><br>
t<br><br>
benefits, is a three-layer smectite-type clay with an ion exchange capacity of at least 50 meq/lOOg.  The combination of builder salt and clay is described as helping prevent agglomeration of the clay, thus allowing efficient deposition of the clay on fabric.  In GB 1428061, a similar fabric softening composition is disclosed with a water-insoluble quaternary ammonium salt present as an anti-static agent.  The smectite-type clay, responsible for imparting softness benefits, has a particle size below 50 microns and an ion-exchange capacity of at least 50 meg/100 grams.<br>
In US 5,443,750, clay, which may be smectite clay, is used in conjunction with an enzyme in a detergent composition to afford increased softening properties.<br>
EP-A-0 381 487 describes the use of liquid detergent compositions in which a clay (an aluminosilicate eg, smectite) is treated with a barrier material, selected from a siloxane, a polysiloxane, a polyacrylate, dialkyl citrate, alkoxylated dialkyl citrate, alkoxylated glycerol mono- and di-stearates,--and alkoxylated N-alkyl. alkanolamides,. prior to incorporation of the clay into the formulation.<br>
The treatment of a range of water insoluble materials, including clay, with an organosilicon compound bearing a quaternary ammonium group is taught in US 4,557,854.  The organosilicon groups are grafted onto the surface of the clay particles and, therefore, will be bound to the silicon atoms in the layers of the clay by way of Si-0 linkages. The effect of the treatment is described as being to<br><br><br>
increase the cleaning power of conventional organic surface-active agents.<br>
The treatment of cotton fabrics with cross-linking agents, such as  butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), is known to impart anti-wrinkle properties.  However, such treatments tend to make the fabric stiff and.relatively easy to tear.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a system which is applicable to the treatment of fabric in order to provide desirable properties in the fabric. Desirable properties which may be achieved in the fabric as a result of treatment with a composition according to the invention include, for example, one or  more of the following benefits: anti-wrinkle, increased softness, better shape, improved texture, improved colour (including surface colour definition), better antistatic properties, reduced friction, better comfort in wear, increased water absorption or increased water resistance and/or repellence and better durability (ie, resistance to wear-, including anti-pilling and anti-fuzz properties).  In a.particularly preferred, embodiment, the compositions of the invention are used for reducing the extent of creasing of fabric, such as  before and/or during and/or after laundering.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a fabric treatment composition comprising a textile compatible carrier and water insoluble particles having a layered<br><br><br>
structure comprising oxygen atoms and silicon and/or phosphorus atoms, and comprising organic functional groups which are bonded to silicon and/or phosphorus atoms in the layers by direct covalent bonds between the silicon and/or phosphorus atoms and a carbon atom.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a. fabric treatment composition comprising a textile compatible carrier and water insoluble particles having a layered structure comprising oxygen atoms and silicon and/or phosphorus atoms, and comprising organic functional groups which are bonded to silicon and/or phosphorus atoms in the layers by direct covalent bonds between the silicon and/or phosphorus atoms and a carbon atom, in the treatment of fabric.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating fabric comprising treating the fabric with a fabric treatment composition comprising a textile compatible carrier and water insoluble particles having a layered structure comprising oxygen, atoms and., silicon and/or phosphorus atoms, and comprising organic functional groups which are bonded to silicon and/or phosphorus atoms in the layers by direct covalent bonds between the silicon and/or phosphorus atoms and a carbon atom.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based on the application to the treatment of fabric of water insoluble particles having a<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
layered structure comprising oxygen atoms arid silicon and/or phosphorus atoms, and comprising organic functional groups which are bonded to silicon and/or phosphorus atoms in the layers by direct covalent bonds to carbon ie, covalent bonds between silicon and carbon (Si-C bonds) or between phosphorus and carbon (P-C bonds).<br>
The water-insoluble particles<br>
The present invention involves the use of water-insoluble particles having a layered structure comprising oxygen atoms and silicon and/or phosphorus atoms, and comprising organic functional groups which are bonded to silicon and/or phosphorus atoms in the layers by direct covalent bonds between the silicon and/or phosphorus atoms and a carbon atom. The term ""water-insoluble", as used herein, means that the particles are soluble in distilled water at a concentration of less than 0.01g/l, preferably less than 0.001 g/1 at 20CC.  Preferably, the particles will be substantially insoluble but dispersible in water at 20°C.<br>
The water insoluble particles used in the invention are of a size such that they are not perceived as distinct particles to the touch.  Preferably, the particles used in the invention have an average size of from 0.1 to lOOum.  More preferably, the particles used herein have an average size in the range of from about lum to 50um.  The size of the particles- refers to their maximum dimension, such as their diameter when the particles are substantially spherical.<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
The layered nature of the particles preferably involves an ordered array comprising oxygen atoms and silicon and/or phosphorus atoms. The layers may also comprise other metallic and/or non-metallic atoms.  Other atoms which may be present in the layers include, for. example, di- and/or tri- valent metal atoms, such as of alkaline earth metals (eg, magnesium or calcium), of transition metals (eg, copper, nickel and/or zirconium), of Group IIIB of the periodic table (eg, aluminium) or of mixtures thereof. Suitable particles may comprise discrete, repeating units of layers or sheets. Layers or sheets are substantially two-" dimensional arrays of atoms. Preferably, the repeating unit consists of a plurality of (eg, two or three) layers, or sheets, of atoms with a metallic atom or a mixture of metallic atoms forming the central layer and a range of non-metallic atoms bridging and/or forming the surrounding layers.  Also present within the repeating unit may be a variety of atomic, ionic or molecular species, including for example, polyvalent metal ions such as sodium and/or calcium and/or hydroxonium ions.<br>
Suitable examples of layered structures include those comprising divalent or trivalent metal ions, or a mixture thereof, in the central layer.  Preferably, the central layer comprises magnesium, nickel or aluminium ions, or mixtures thereof, which are connected via oxygen atoms and/or hydroxyl groups to the surrounding layer. Preferably, the surrounding layers comprise a mixture of silicon atoms and oxygen atoms as well as other cationic and/or molecular species.<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
The interlayer spacing in the particles which are used in the invention is preferably greater than 10X, more preferably greater than 12X, as determined by X-ray crystallography.  The interlayer spacing preferably does not exceed about 100X and, more preferably, it does not exceed about 5OX.<br>
When the central layer comprises divalent ions and the outer layer comprises silicon atoms, with bridging oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups, the layered structure is analogous"to that of talc-like smectite, or phyllosilicate clays.<br>
Smectite clays can broadly be differentiated on the basis of the number of octahedral metal-oxygen arrangements in the central layer for a given number of silicon-oxygen atoms in the outer layer. Those clays featuring primarily divalent metal ions comprise the prototype talc and the members hectorite, saponite, sauconite and vermiculite. When the clays feature primarily trivalent metal ions the structures change and now comprise the prototype pyrophillite, montmorillonite, nontronrte and volchonskoite.<br>
The water insoluble particles comprise one or more organic functional groups. The functional groups in each particle may be a single type of functional group or a mixture of different types of functional groups.  These organic functional groups can be at least partly responsible for conferring the desired properties on the fabric, after treatment with the particles or compositions comprising the particles.<br><br><br>
1<br><br>
The organic functional groups comprise at least one carbon atom and are directly bound, by a covalent bond from a carbon atom in the organic functional group to a silicon or phosphorus atom which forms part of a layer in the water-insoluble particles.  Preferred organic functional groups include alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyland aryl groups, optionally substituted.  Optional substituents include, for example, one or more of the same or different groups selected from halo, OR", OCOR1, NR2R3, N+R4R5R6, COX, NCO, N02, S02R7, S03H, H2P04, PO(OR")2 and heterocycloalkyl, wherein X is selected from halo, OR8, OCOR9, OH, H and R10 and R", R1, R2 , R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, _R9 and R10 are independently selected from C1 to C6 alkyl, C2 to C6 alkenyl and hydrogen. When the organic functional groups comprise acid groups, such as C02H, SO3H, OH or H2P04, they may be in the form of the corresponding deprotonated ions (eg, as sodium salts)-<br>
The term "halo" means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. Suitable halo-substituted groups include, for example, fluoroalkyl, such as perfluoroalkyl<br>
The term "alkyl" includes C1 to C2o (preferably C1 to C12, more preferably C1 -C6) branched or unbranched acyclic groups and, for C3 to C8, cyclic groups.  Acyclic alkyl groups may be substituted in the chain by one or more S or 0 atoms or NH groups and/or substituted on the chain by one or more =0 groups.  Optionally substituted acyclic alkyl groups include, for example, optionally substituted methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl.  Optionally substituted cycloalkyl<br><br><br>
groups include, for example, optionally substituted cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Cycloalkyl groups may be substituted in the ring by one or more S or 0 atoms or NH groups and/or substituted on the ring by one or more =0 groups.<br>
The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" are defined similarly to the term "alkyl" but include, respectively, one or more carbon-carbon double bonds or carbon-carbon triple bonds.<br>
The term "aryl" includes aromatic, heterocyclic and carbocyclic ring compounds, which may be single rings or fused rings.  Heterocyclic aryl groups include, for example, pyridyl, pyrrolyl, thiophenyl and furanyl.  Carbocyclic aryl. groups include phenyl and naphthyl.<br>
The term "aralkyl" means alkyl substituted with aryl eg, benzyl.<br>
The term "heterocycloalkyl" includes C3-to C8 (preferably C3 to C6) cyclic groups containing one or more heteroatoms in the ring.  Heteroatoms include one or more of the same or different groups or atoms selected from ,0, S, NH and N-alkyl. Heterocyclic alkyl groups may be substituted in the ring with, for example, one or more keto (C=0) groups. Heterocycloalkyl groups therefore include, for example, epoxide, aziridine, azetidinium, lactones, azalactones and cyclic anhydrides (eg, succinic anhydride) and mono- and di-saccharides (eg, a group derived from glucose, fructose or sucrose).  Polysaccharides (including, for example, dextrins, cyclodextrins, dextrans, cellulose and modified<br><br><br>
cellulose) are also suitable functional groups for use in the invention.<br>
It has been found that, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the use of fabric compositions comprising water-insoluble particles having a layered structure and comprising one or more organic functional groups which are capable of self cross-linking and/or reacting with, the fibres of the fabric leads to improved anti-wrinkle, ie, crease reduction, performance of fabrics, without the disadvantages of conventional cross-linking agents such as butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA).  Hence, fabrics treated with compositions of the invention comprising water-insoluble particles as described above have good antiwrinkle properties but are less stiff, less prone to discolouring and less susceptible to tearing than fabrics treated with some conventional cross-linking agents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the organic functional group is capable of self cross-linking and/or of forming covalent bonds with the surface of a fibre eg, cellulosic and/or proteinaceoua fibres.. Cellulosic fibres possess hydroxyl groups; proteins possess a range of functional groups.  Preferably, the organic functional groups comprise electrophilic groups which are capable of reacting with hydroxyl groups for reaction with, for example, cellulosic fibres or proteinaceous fibres and/or thiol groups for more specific reaction, for example, with proteinaceous fibres.  Suitable examples of electrophilic groups include: acid anhydrides, epoxides, acid chlorides, isocyanates, azetidinium-containing groups, carboxylic acids, vinyl sulfones, aldehydes, ketones, enol esters,<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
aziridines, azalactones and mixtures thereof.  The epoxide group is especially preferred.  In fabric treated according to the invention, with these compositions of the invention, the water-insoluble particles may be cross-linked to each other and/or bound to the surface of fabric fibres. Preferably, the water insoluble particles are cross-linked to each &gt;other and. bound to the fibres. The particles may act to confer anti-wrinkle benefits through a range of other physical and/or chemical mechanisms.<br>
The water insoluble particles are preferably of a clay functionalised by the introduction of organic functional groups during its synthesis. The organic functional groups may be converted to different organic functional groups by reaction of the clay, after it has been synthesised, with an appropriate reagent, to form another clay which is suitable for use in the present invention. Appropriate reagents and reaction conditions for the interconversion of functional groups are well-known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the clay may need no. conversion of functional groups prior to use in the compositions of the invention.<br>
More preferably, the water insoluble functionalised particles are of the general class of inorganic-organic hybrid clays known as an organo(phyllosilicates).  Examples of synthetic methods for forming organo(phyllosilicates), or organoclays, are described in J.    Mater.     Chem.,   vol.  8, 1998, p 1927-1932, J. Phys.   Chem.   B.   1997, 101, 531-539, J. Chem.   Soc,   Ckem.   Commun.,   1995, 241-242 and J.  Mater.   Chem. 2000, 10, 1457-1463.  In these examples, the organic functionality is introduced into the clay by assembling a<br><br><br>
metal oxide/hydroxide framework in the presence of an organotrialkoxysilane.  The water insoluble particles of the present invention are preferably produced according to this method.  Therefore, the water-insoluble particles are preferably obtainable by the hydrolysis of an orgariotrialkoxysilane in the presence of at least one di- or tri- valent metal ion in an alcoholic solution at a suitable pH appropriate to the metal ion used. The skilled person is readily able to determine a suitable pH for the hydrolysis on the basis of the teaching of the prior art.  For example, for magnesium, the pH is typically greater than 7 and for aluminium it will typically be in the range of from pH 5-12 (preferably from 5.5 to 6.5) .<br>
Other water insoluble functionalised-particles are also suitable for use in the present invention. For example, metal organophosphates (including zirconium (which is preferred), titanium, hafnium, vanadium (V), magnesium (II), manganese (II), calcium {ID, cadmium (II), lanthanum (III), samarium (III), cerium (III) andiron (III)).can be prepared by a precipitation reaction.involving mixing,a solution, of the metal ion and a solution of an organic phosphoric or phosphinic acid. Crystallisation of the layered structure results.  Synthetic routes of this type are described, for example, in Ace.   Chem.   Res.,   1992, 25, 420-427, Chem.  Mater. 1994, 6, 2227, Ace.  Chem.  Res.,   1978, 11, 163 and Chem. Rev.,   1988, 88, 55.  Zirconium organophosphates, and other metal organophosphates, typically comprise, in each layer, a plane of metal atoms linked together by phosphonate groups. The metal atoms are preferably octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms, with the three oxygen atoms of each<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
phosphonate tetrahedron bound to three different metal atoms.<br>
The preferred water-insoluble particles used in the invention are organoclays and more preferably three-layer clays consisting of a central metal-containing layer, as in the analogous talc-like structures, together with bridging oxygen and hydroxyl groups and silicon atoms in the outer . two layers.  Unlike talc, however, the outer silicon atoms are attached to organic groups as well as oxygen atoms. Preferably, a high proportion (for example greater than 50% by number, more preferably greater than 75% by number) of the Si atoms in any given organoclay particle are covalently bonded to at least one carbon atom.  However, the layered structure may contain varying amounts of Si atoms that are not covalently bonded.to a. carbon atom, and these particles will also operate effectively within the scope of the invention.<br>
The organoclays preferably comprise silicon or phosphorus, oxygen, metal (eg, magnesium, nickel, zirconium, or aluminium or mixtures thereof) and, optionally, hydrogen atoms, in addition to the organic functional groups and the organic functional groups in the water insoluble particles.<br>
Preferred particles of the invention may have the general formula<br>
MxSi8.yOl6-3y(OH)4+3y,<br><br><br>
i<br><br>
wherein:<br>
M is Mg, Ni, Cu or Al<br>
x is 6 when M is Mg, Ni or Cu; and 4 when M is Al<br>
y is between 0 and 4<br>
In a particularly preferred example of the invention, the organoclay may be represented by the formula  with a silicon to magnesium ratio of 1.33 and where R is any one of the suitable organic functional groups listed above. R may, for example, comprise a" reactive functional group, as described hereinbefore, and a divalent linker group such as a C1 to C18 (preferably C1 to C12) branched or unbranched alkylene group eg, (CH2)n where n is an integer from 1 to 6. The linker group is bound at one end to the organic functional group capable of reacting with a cellulosic or proteinaceous fibre and at the other end to a silicon atom. Again, the particles are preferably functionalised by virtue of a "direct Si-C covalent bond created "during the synthesis of the whole material," not" by synthetic post-mcdificatiorr (eg, by grafting onto the surface of a preformed clay particle); this allows far more organic functional groups to be incorporated at the surface of, and/or within the layers of, the water-insoluble particle.<br>
Treatment of fabric with the fabric treatment compositions of the invention comprises any step in which the compositions are applied to fabric.<br><br><br>
Typically, application occurs with the composition in the form of an aqueous dispersion or suspension.  Treatments include laundering of the fabric.<br>
The fabric preferably comprises synthetic or non-synthetic fibres or mixtures thereof.  Non-synthetic fibres include, for example, cellulosic (eg, cotton) or proteinaceous (eg, wool or silk) fibres.  Synthetic fibres include, for example, nylons and polyesters.<br>
If the compositions of the invention comprise water-insoluble particles which are capable of self-cross-linking and/or of forming covalent bonds with cellulosic and/or proteinaceous fibres, fabric treated with the .composition of i the invention is preferably subsequently heated.  In laundering the fabric, this heating may be provided during the laundering cycle or possibly during tumble or line drying.  Preferably, however, the heat necessary for ensuring maximum coverage of the fibre with the water insoluble particles is provided during ironing.. Typically, the heating step involves heating the fabric to a. . temperature in the range of from 50 to 150°C, more preferably from 60 to 100°C.<br>
The invention may also be carried out in non-domestic environments.  For example, the method of the invention may involve the treatment of fabric (before or after it has been made into finished articles such as garments) on an industrial scale.<br><br><br>
The water insoluble particles having a layered structure and comprising one or more organic functional groups are preferably present in the fabric treatment composition in an amount of from 0.01% to 50% by weight of the composition; more preferably they are present in an amount of from 0.1% to 20% by weight of the composition, most, preferably 0.1-10% by weight of the composition.<br>
The fabric treatment composition contains one or more textile compatible carriers.<br>
The nature of the textile compatible carrier will be dictated to a large extent by the stage at which the composition of the invention is used in a laundering process, the compositions being capable of being .used, in principle, at any stage of the process.  For example, where the compositions are for use as main wash detergent compositions, which is preferred, the one or more textile compatible carriers comprise a detergent active compound. Where the compositions are for use in the rinsing step of a laundering, process. the. one or, mars textile, compatible carriers may comprise a fabric softening and/or conditioning compound.<br>
The compositions of the invention preferably comprise a perfume, such as of the type which is conventionally used in fabric care compositions.  The compositions may be in the form of packaged articles which are labelled as being for use in a domestic laundering process.<br><br><br>
The textile compatible carrier is a component which can assist in the interaction of the first component with the fabric. The  carrier can also provide benefits in addition to those provided by the first component e.g. softening, cleaning etc.<br>
If the composition of the invention ,is to be used before, or after, the laundry process it may be in the form of a spray or foaming product.<br>
The laundering processes of the present invention include the large scale and small scale (eg domestic) cleaning of fabrics.  Suitable fabrics include fabrics which are in the form of garments. Preferably, the processes are domestic.<br>

Example 5<br>
Demonstrating improved, crease recovery performance of cotton<br>
poplin treated with a funtionalised organoclay<br>
Method of measuring crease recovery performance<br>
  The method described here to monitor the ability cf a fabric to recover from an induced crease is used within the textile    industry.  Before any treatment was applied the warp   direction on the fabric to be used was marked.  Having done this, the fabric was saturated by padding on a solution of the organoclay (0.1 to 2% by weight of the fabric) under pressure.  Excess dispersion was removed.  The fabric was tumble dried and ironed flat. The ironed fabric was left to condition at 65% relative humidity (r.h.) and 20"C for 24 hours prior to testing.<br><br><br>
The fabric was then ready for testing.  All testing was done in a test room at 65% r.h. and 20*C using tweezers to handle the fabrics at all times, in order to prevent extraneous grease from affecting the results.  Six rectangular samples, each with an area of 50 mm by 25 mm, were cut from the treated fabric, using a template," and cut such that the long edge was parallel to the warp direction.  The sample was then folded in half crossways, so that each sample was a square with an area of 25 mm square.<br>
The sample was then placed on the lower plate of a loading device such that the crease was under the weight and the ends were in line with the edge of the lower plate. The weight was then lowered down gently, not bumped/ and settled  using a wiggling, motion. After leaving for one minute, the  weight was removed and the sample transferred to from the   loading device to a tester (protractor) using a pair of  tweezers. The fabric was positioned and fixed such that one  end touched the back-stop and the free end hung vertically.<br><br>
 After leaving the fabric in a vertical position for 1  minute, the crease recovery angle (CRA) was measured by<br><br>
  taking a reading from the circular scale at the index line,  whereby one red line was observed, not two.<br>
 The four functionalised organoclays of Examples 1 to 4 were<br>
I   used in the set of experiments conducted with cotton poplin<br><br>
    (see Table 1).  In each case, an aqueous slurry of the<br><br>
 functionalised organoclay, as obtained directly from its<br>
synthesis in.- Examples- 1 to 4, was diluted with water to an<br>
 appropriate weight percent of organoclay and applied<br>
 directly to the cotton fabric by pad application.<br><br><br><br>
Following the method of measuring crease recovery perfo-rmance described above, it was found that deposits of 0.1-2.0% by weight of cotton poplin of the fuctionalised organoclay considerably improved the crease recovery performance of the cotton poplin.  This was observed to be. particularly the case when the functional group was capable of covalently attaching the organoclay to the cellulosic<br>
|fibres.<br><br>
The  crease recovery"performance"of cotton poplin treated<br>
with 2% by weight of cotton fabric of functionalised clays<br>
i<br>
is given in Table 1. Cotton poplin which had been treated<br>
with functionalised organoclays was compared with two<br><br>
standards: (a) cotton poplin that liad been treated with a<br><br>
background" basic aqueous ethanolic solution {Comparative<br>
Example 1); (b) cotton poplin treated with 2%-by weight of<br>
cotton fabric of an unfunctionalised smectite-type clay<br>
-(Comparative Example 2). All experiments were carried out<br><br>
according to the general method of measuring crease recovery<br>
performance.<br><br><br>
	-    ..       -<br>
 The data in Table 1 clearly shows that when cotton poplin is  treated with a functionalised organoclay, capable of forming<br><br>
 covalent bonds with cellulosic fibres, the crease recovery<br><br>
  performance of the cotton fabric is considerably improved,  compared with untreated cotton poplin and cotton poplin which had been treated with an unfunctionalised clay.                                                                                                       <br><br><br>
Table 1                                                                Crease Recovery Angle (CRA) Data for treatment of Cotton<br>

Comparative Example 2	71<br>
In all of these examples, the lower the crease recovery angle, the greater the deviation of the crease from the vertical plane of the cotton fabric and the more extensive is the creasing ie, less successful is the antiwrinkle composition.<br>
Example 6.<br>
Crease assessment following tumble drying<br>
The following method was used:<br>
•	Enough cotton sheeting ballast to make the dry load<br>
weight 1kg was obtained.<br>
•	Ballast was wetted in a European washing machine<br>
(Miele®) and the drum drained.<br><br><br><br>
•	For each treatment, five replicates (40 x 4 0 cm square) of resinated cotton poplin were used.<br>
•	Treatments were pad applied (0.5%"and 2% on weight of fabric).<br>
•	Whilst still wet from padding, the fabric squares were randomly distributed throughout the drum of the washing machine containing the ballast load.<br>
•	The load (samples + ballast) was subjected to the spin cycle of the machine.<br>
•	The whole load was dried on normal setting until the end of the cool down cycle (approx. 30 minutes).<br>
•	Replicates were separated from the ballast and imaged.<br>
.   Replicates were panelled.<br>
30 comparisons were made against the untreated control samples in total. The following table shows treatment (row) score against treatment (column) showing the number of preferences, out of 30, for treated over untreated samples, for example, Epoxyclay (0.5%) v. Untreated = 29 v.l.<br><br>
