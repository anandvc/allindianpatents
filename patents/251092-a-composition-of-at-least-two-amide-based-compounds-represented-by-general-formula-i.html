				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
AMIDE-BASED COMPOUND, POLYOLEFIN RESIN COMPOSITION<br>
AND MOLDED PRODUCT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an amide-based compound, a process for producing the same, a polyolef in resin nucleating agent containing the amide-based compound, a polyolef in resin composition containing the nucleating agent, and a molded product thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Polyolef in resins are used in various fields as materials for film forming, sheet forming, blowmolding, injection molding, etc., due to their excellent moldability, mechanical characteristics, electrical properties, etc.<br>
Although generally excellent in physical properties, the resins are low in transparency, cry stallizability and rigidity. In some applications, outstanding properties inherently possessed by the resins are insufficiently exhibited and thus the application of such resins is limited under the present circumstances.<br><br>
There have heretofore been proposals to use amide-based compounds so as to improve the transparency, crystallizability and rigidity of polyolef in resins (Japanese Patent No. 3401868, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1995-242610, and WO 00/52089). Although such amide-based compounds are favorable in imparting transparency and mechanical strength (especially, rigidity) to polyolefin resins, development of a nucleating agent is sought which can impart further excellent physical properties to polyolefin resins.<br>
In particular, the amide-based nucleating agent disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1995-242610 imparts excellent transparency/ crystallizability and rigidity to polyolefin resins, but the thermal stability and alkali resistance of the amide-based nucleating agents themselves are not satisfactory, and improvement in thermal stability and alkali resistance is demanded.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the above-described problems, and thus provide an amide-based compound which has improved thermal stability and alkali resistance and which can produce a molded product with further improved transparency, , crystallizability (heat-resistance) and rigidity; a process for producing the compound; a polyolef in<br><br>
resin nucleating agent containing the amide-based compound as an essential ingredient; a polyolefin resin composition comprising the nucleating agent, and a molded product thereof. In view of the above circumstances, the inventors have conducted intensive research to solve the problems, and obtained the following findings.<br>
(1) For the amide-based nucleating agent of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.1995-242610, commercially available 2-methylcyclohexylamine was used as a starting material. The 2-methylcyclohexylamine commercially available as a reagent or a industrial material is a mixture of its cis isomer and trans isomer wherein the ratio of trans isomer: cis isomer is about 68 : 32 (%, as determined by GLC (gas-liquid chromatography)), and mixtures with other compositions have not been sold. The amide-based nucleating agent prepared using this starting material and disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.1995-242610, such as 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid tetrakis(2-methylcyclohexylamide), 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid<br>
tris(2-methylcyclohexylamide) or the like, also has amide moieties in the form of a. mixture of trans configuration and cis configuration, so that the nucleating agent is actually a mixture of at least two amide-based compounds having different trans-configured amide moiety to cis-configured amide moiety<br>
ratios.<br>
(2)	The inventors found that the ratio of the<br>
trans-configured moiety to cis-configured moiety in the<br>
amide-based compound mixture is substantially the same as the<br>
ratio of the trans isomer : cis isomer (as determined by GLC)<br>
of the 2-methylcyclohexylamine used as the starting material,<br>
based on the results of a series of studies, such as comparison<br>
of the trans : cis ratio of the starting 2-alkylcyclohexylamine<br>
with the trans : cis ratio of the unreacted<br>
2-alkylcyclohexylamine recovered after subjecting said<br>
starting 2-alkylcyclohexylamine to amidation reaction. Thus,<br>
the ratio of trans configured moiety : cis configured moiety<br>
in the amide-based compound mixture is controllable by the<br>
trans : cis isomer ratio of the starting material amine.<br>
(3)	The inventors also found that the proportion of the<br>
trans configured moiety in the amide-based compound mixture<br>
is linearly proportional to the ratio (namely, Ctrans to be<br>
described later) as defined by us ing 1) the absorbance (Atrans) ,<br>
as measured by FT-IR spectroscopy (Fourier Transform Infrared<br>
Spectroscopy), at a wavenumber at which the N-H stretching<br>
vibration absorption signal of the<br>
trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue of the corresponding all-trans amide-based compound appears, and 2) the absorbance (Acis) , as measured by FT-IR spectroscopy, at a wavenumber at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption signal of the<br>
cis-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue of the corresponding all-cis amide-based compound appears.<br>
Therefore, the ratio of the trans-configured moiety to cis-configured moiety in the amide-based compound mixture is verified by measuring the FT-IR spectrum of the amide-based compound mixture.<br>
(4)	The inventors conducted a research by varying the<br>
above-mentioned ratio of trans-configured moiety to<br>
cis-configured moiety in amide-based compounds, and found that<br>
the use of a nucleating agent comprising an amide-based compound<br>
mixture with a large proportion (content) of trans-configured<br>
moiety or an all-trans compound elevates the crystallization<br>
temperature of a polyolef in resin composition containing said<br>
nucleating agent, and improves the rigidity of a polyolefin<br>
resin molded product obtained from the polyolefin resin<br>
composition.<br>
(5)	A nucleating agent with a large proportion (content)<br>
of trans moiety in the amide-based compound mixture has a melting<br>
point higher than the nucleating agent disclosed in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1995-242610, and is superior<br>
to it in thermal stability and alkali resistance.<br>
Based on these findings, the inventors conducted further research and accompli shed the present invention. The invention provides a. mixture of at least two amide-based compounds represented by General Formula (1) or an all-trans amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1), a process for producing saidmixture or saidall-trans compound, apolyolefin resin nucleating agent comprising saidmixture or saidall-trans compound, a polyolefin resin composition containing said mixture or said all-trans compound (or said nucleating agent) , a molded product thereof, and the like.<br>

(FIGURE REMOVED)<br><br><br>
wherein R3 represents a CI-IQ linear or branched alkyl group. Examples of such 2-alkylcyclohexylamine are cis isomer, trans isomer, or a mixture thereof, of a 2-alkylcyclohexylamine wherein the alkyl moiety is a linear or branched alkyl group (Ci to GIO) , such as 2-methylcyclohexylamine, 2-ethylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-propyIcyclohexylamine, 2-iso-propylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-iso-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-sec-butyIcyclohexylamine, 2-tert-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-pentylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-hexylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-heptylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-octylcyclohexylamine, 2-ethylhexylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-nonylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-decylcyclohexylamine, etc. Preferable among these are cis- or trans-2-alkyl (Ci to C5) cyclohexylamines or a mixture thereof, and specif ic examples include 2-methylcyclohexylamine, 2-ethylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-propylcyclohexylamine, 2-iso-propylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-iso-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-sec-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-tert-butylcyclohexylamine, 2-n-pentylcyclohexylamine, etc., and in particular, cis- or trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine or a mixture thereof is preferable.<br>

The purity of 2-alkylcyclohexylamines is generally 98% by weight or more, preferably 99% by weight or more, and more preferably 99.5% by weight or more.<br>
As described above, the proportion of total content of trans structure : total content of cis structure (total trans structure content/total cis structure content) of the stereoisomeric 2-alkyl (Ci to CIQ)-cyclohexylamine residue constituting the amide-based compound mixture or all-trans compound is 70/30 to 100/0.<br>

The invention also include a mixture of at least two amide-based compounds of the formula (1) wherein the trans-configured moiety is present in a proportion of at least 70 mole% but less than 100 mole% of the total 2-alkylcyclohexylamine residues in the mixture.<br>
Therefore, in preparing such an all-trans amide-based compound or a mixture having a trans-configured moiety proportion of not less than 70 mole% but less than 100 mole%, it is preferable to use, as a starting material, a trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine (i.e, trans isomer itself), or a mixture in which a trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine (trans isomer) and a cis-2-alkylcyclohexylamine (cis isomer) are contained and in which the content of the<br>

Such a pure trans isomer or a trans-isomer-rich mixture is obtained by a procedure used for isolating the trans isomer alone by, for example, distillation etc. , from a commercially available mixture of the trans isomer and cis isomer (the trans isomer content measured by GLC is about 68.4%). The distillation may be carried out under atmospheric pressure or<br>
reduced pressure. From the standpoint of suppressing decomposition of the amine, the distillation is preferably carried out under a reduced pressure. The distillation temperature is not particularly limited, but is 150°C or lower, and preferably 100°C or lower. When the distillation is conducted under reduced pressure, the pressure is not particularly limited, but it is preferably about 0.5 to about 15kPa, andmore preferably about 1 toaboutlOkPa. Distillation can be conducted by a conventional method, and for example, include, but is not limited to, a simple distillation, a distillation using a multi-stage distillation column, etc. Such distillation makes it possible to obtain substantially pure trans isomer alone, or to obtain a trans isomer-cis isomer mixture with a trans isomer content of 70% or more (measured by GLC).<br>
The amine starting material, which is the thus-obtained pure trans isomer or a trans isomer-cis isomer mixture with a trans isomer content of 70% or more (measured by GLC) , and a polycarboxylie acid represented by General Formula (2) or a reactive derivative thereof (for example, acid anhydride, acidhalide, ester, etc.) , are subjected to amidation reaction to thereby synthesize the desired amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) or the desired mixture.<br>
The desired mixture of the amide-based compounds representedby General Formula (1) may also be producedby mixing<br>
an all-trans amide-based compound obtained by the above process wherein the R2 groups are 100% in trans configuration with an amide-based compound having different type of a stereoisomeric configuration (for example, an amide-based compound wherein the two to six R2 groups in the molecule are all in cis configuration, mixed-type amide-based compounds wherein at least one member of the two to six R2 groups has a trans configuration, and the remainder have a cis configuration, etc.) such that the proportion of the trans-2-alkyIcyclohexylamine residue represented by formula (a) is 70 mole% or more but less than 100 mole%.<br>
The above-mentioned amidation reaction can be conducted according to known processes, for example, by the processes disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1995-242610. More specifically, the following process may be adopted.<br>
(i) A polycarboxylic acid represented by General Formula<br>

material at 60 to 280°C in an inert solvent for 2 to 50 hours.<br>
In this production process, it is preferable to use an activator so as to shorten the reaction time. Examples of the activators include phosphorus pentoxide, polyphosphoric acid, phosphorus pentoxide-methanesulfonic acid, phosphites (e.g., triphenyl phosphite)-pyridine, phosphite-metal salts (for example, lithium chloride etc.), triphenylphosphine-hexachloroethane, etc.  In general, an activator is used in approximately equimolar amount relative to each carboxyl group of the polycarboxylic acid represented by General Formula (2).<br>

The particle diameter of the amide-based compound that is used as a polyolef in resin nucleating agent is not limited as long as the effects of the invention can be obtained. However, from the viewpoint of dispersibility or dissolution speed in a molten resin, the smaller the average particle diameter the better. The average particle diameter, as measured by a laser diffraction light scattering method, is generally 0.1 to 500 HHI, preferably 1 to 200 \m, and more preferably 1 to 100 fjjn.<br>

The polyolefin nucleating agent of the invention may further contain known polyolefin modifiers, as optional components. Examples of such polyolefin modifiers include the various additives listed in "The Tables of Positive Lists of Additives" edited by the Japan Hygienic Olefin and Styrene Plastic Association (January, 2002) . More specific examples include stabilizers (such as metal compounds, epoxy compounds , nitrogen compounds, phosphorus compounds, sulfur compounds, etc.), UV absorbers (such as benzophenone compounds and benzotriazole compounds), antioxidants (such as phenol compounds, phosphorous ester compounds, and sulfur compounds) , surfactants, lubricants (such as paraffin, wax, and other aliphatic hydrocarbons, C8 to C22 higher fatty acids, C8 to C22 higher fatty acid metal (Li,Na, K, Al, Ca, Mg, Zn) salts, C8 to €22 higher aliphatic alcohols, polyglycols, esters of €4 to C22 higher fatty acids and €4 to Ci8 aliphatic monohydric alcohols, C8 to C22 higher fatty acid amides, silicone oils, and rosin derivatives, fillers (such as talc, hydrotalcite, mica, zeolite, perlite, diatomaceous earth, calcium carbonate, and glass fibers), foaming agents, foaming auxiliaries, polymer additives , plasticizers (such as dialkyl phthalates anddialkyl hexahydrophthalates, etc.) , crosslinkingagents, crosslinking accelerators, antistatic agents, flame retardants, dispersants, organic and inorganic pigments, working auxiliaries, other nucleating agents, and like additives.<br>
When the above-mentioned additives and/or polyolefin modifiers are used, these may be added to the single amide-based compound represented by General Formula (1) , or to a mixture of two or more such compounds, by a known method such as dry blending.<br>
Polyolefin resin composition<br>
The polyolefin resin composition of the invention is obtained by incorporating the amide-based compound mixture or all-trans compound of the invention, or a nucleating agent containing the amide-based compound mixture or all-trans compound of the invention, into a polyolefin resin by a conventional method.<br>
The polyolefin resin composition of the invention can be manufactured by any conventional method, with no particular restrictions thereon, as long as the desired resin composition is obtained. For example, a polyolefin resin (powder or granules) , the amide-based compound of the invention, and, if necessary, the above-mentioned polyolefin modifier are mixed using a conventional mixer, such as a Henschel mixer, a ribbon blender, a V-blender or the like to obtain a blend type polyolefin resin composition. Other examples include a method in which this blend type polyolefin resin composition is melt-kneaded in a conventional kneader, such as a single screw or twin screw extruder, generally at a temperature of 160 to 300 ° C, preferably 180to260°C, and the extruded strands are cooled, and the strands thus obtained are cut into pellets.<br>
When an amide-based compound mixture of the invention or an all-trans amide-based compound is added, as such, or in the form of a nucleating agent containing the above additives, polyolefin modifier, etc., to a polyolefin resin, there are no particular restrictions on the amount of the mixture or all-trans amide-based compound of the invention (if it is added in the form of such a nucleating agent, the amount calculated as the mixture or all-trans amide-based compound of the invention) as long as the desired effects can be produced, and the amount can be suitably selected from a wide range. Generally, however, the amount is 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.03 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.05 to 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin resin. By blending the amide-based compound of the invention in an amount within these ranges, effects of the invention can be sufficiently produced.<br>
If the amount is less than 0.01 part by weight, the nucleating agent effect is insufficient and the mechanical characteristics (such as rigidity, etc.) of the molded product are unsatisfactory.  In contrast, even if the content exceeds 10 parts by weight, further improved effects are not obtained.<br>
A single-step addition using a conventionally used equipment, such as a single screw or twin screw extruder, etc. , is preferable as the method of adding the amide-based compound to the polyolefin resin. However, a two-step addition using a master batch of high concentration in the range of about 2 to 15 wt.% may also be employed.<br>
Examples of polyolefin resins that can be used in the invention include polyethylene-based resins, polypropylene-based resins, polybutene-based resins, methyl-pentene-based resins, butadiene-based resins and the like.

Examples of catalysts used for manufacturing such polymers include not only generally used Ziegler-Natta catalysts but also catalyst systems comprising a combination of a transition metal compound (e.g. , a titanium halide such as titanium trichloride or titanium tetrachloride) supported on a support comprising, as amain component, magnesium chloride or like magnesium halides, with an alkyl aluminum compound (such as triethy1 aluminum or diethy1 aluminum chloride), and metallocene catalysts.<br>
The recommended melt flow rate (hereinafter referred to as "MFR", measured according to JIS K 7210-1995) of the polyolef in resin used in the invention can be suitably selected according to the molding method to be employed, but is usually 0 . 01 to 200 g/10 minutes, andpref erably 0 . 05 to 100 g/lOminutes .<br>
To the extent that the effect of the invention is not impaired, the above-mentioned known polyolef in modifiers may be added to the polyolefin resin composition of the invention depending on the purpose and/or application thereof.<br>

value (%) of the polyolefin resin molded article, crystallization temperature (°C), and flexuralmodulus (kg/mm2) thermal stability (10% weight reduction temperature, °C) and alkali resistance were measured and evaluated by the following methods.<br>
1)	Melting point (°C)<br>
This was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (trade name "DSC-50" , made by Shimadzu Corp) . The temperature of the peak maximum of the endothermic peak was defined as the melting point.<br>
Nitrogen flow rate: 30 ml/minute, heating rate: 10°C/minute, weight of sample: 5mg, and standard sample: silica gel (5 mg).<br>
2)	trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue absorbance proportion<br>
(Ctrans)<br>
Using FT-IR spectrometer (product name: "Spectrum One" manufactured by Perkin Elmer, Inc.), the absorption band of the N-H stretching vibrations present at 3400 to 3100cm"1 were measured.<br>
The trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue absorbance proportion (Ctrans) was calculated from the absorbance (Atrans) measured at a wavenumber at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption of the trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue represented by General Formula (a) of the corresponding all-trans amide-based compound appears, and the absorbance<br>
 (Acis) measured at a wavenumber at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption of the cis-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue represented by General Formula (b) of the corresponding all-cis amide-based compound appears, according to the equation (E):<br>
Ctrans (%) = [Atrans/(Atrans + Acis)] x 100  (E) wherein<br>
Atrans represents the absorbance, as measured by FT-IR spectroscopy, at a wavenumber at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption of the trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue represented by General Formula (a) of the corresponding all-trans amide-based compound appears, and<br>
Acis represents the absorbance, as measured by FT-IR spectroscopy, at a wavenumber at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption of the cis-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue represented by General Formula (b) of the corresponding all-cis amide-based compound appears.<br>
The method will be described below in detail with respect to the trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue absorbance proportion (Ctrans, %) of 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(2-methylcyclohexylamide). a) Preparation of standard samples<br>
1,2,3-Propanetricarboxylic acid<br>
tris (trans-2-methylcyclohexylamide) (all-trans compound) and 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(cis-2-methylcyclohexylamide) (all-cis compound) were fully washed with isopropyl alcohol and an aqueous solution of isopropyl alcohol and dried at 80°C for 6 hours.<br>
Samples were prepared by mixing the washed and dried 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid<br>
tris (trans-2-methylcyclohexylamide) and the washed and dried 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid<br>
tris (cis-2-methylcyclohexylamide) such that the mixtures had a trans-2-methyIcyclohexylamina residue content of 80 mole%, 50 mole% and 20 mole%, based on the total<br>
2-methylcyclohexylamine residues in the mixture. The washed and dried all-trans compound was used as a sample having a trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue content of 100 mole%. Prior to the FT-IRmeasurement, each sample thus provided was fully ground using an agate mortar in the presence of methanol for wetting the sample, and then dried, and then used as a standard sample for FT-IR measurement, b) Measurement and preparation of calibration line<br>
An FT-IR instrument (Product name "Spectrum One", manufacturedbyPerkin Elmer, Inc.) , equipped with an attenuated total reflection (hereinafter "ATR") accessory (Universal ATR, manuf actured by Perkin Elmer, Inc.) , was used. The measurement was carried out in the wavenumber range of 650 to 4000 cm'1 under the following conditions: resolution = 4 cm-1, scanning = 16 times, and temperature = 25 °C. Under the conditions, infrared spectra of standard samples having trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue contents of 100 mole% , 80 mole%, 50 mole% and 20 mole% were measured by FT-IR-ATR spectroscopy.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 are the infrared spectrum charts of the all-trans compound. Fig.3 is the infrared spectrum chart of the corresponding all-cis compound, and Fig. 4 is the infrared spectrum chart of the standard sample having a trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue content of 80 mole%.<br>
From the charts as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were determined the wavenumber (3281 cm'1) at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption signal of trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue of the all-trans compound appeared, and the wavenumber (3313 cm-1) at which the N-H stretching vibration absorption signal of cis-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue of the all-cis compound appeared.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 4, using the base-line method (3400 cm-1, 3150 cm-1) , the absorbance (Atrans) at 3281 cm-1 and the absorbance (Acis) at 3313 cm-1 were measured.<br>
Ctrans values (%) , namely, [Atrans/(Atrans + Acis)] x 100, were plotted against the trans-2-methylcylcohexylamine residue contents (mole%) of the standard samples, whereby a calibration line showing a linearly proportional relation was obtained. From the calibration line, Ctrans values of the mixtures and all-trans amide-based compounds used in Examples<br>
and Comparative Examples were determined.<br>
3)	Haze value (%)<br>
The haze value was measured using a haze meter (made by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho) according to JIS K-7136-2000. The smaller the measured value, the higher the transparency.<br>
4)	Crystallization temperature Tc (°C)<br>
Crystallization temperature was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (product name: "DSC7" manufactured by Perkin Elmer, Inc.) according to JIS K-7121. The higher the crystallization temperature Tc, the faster the crystallization speed, and therefore the shorter the molding<br>
cycle can be.<br>
n<br>
5)	Flexural modulus (kg/mm )<br>
Flexural modulus was measured using an Instron universal tester according to JIS K-7203-1982 . The test temperature was 25 °C and the test speed was lOmm/minute. The greater the f lexural modulus, the higher the rigidity of the tested sample.<br>
6)	Thermal stability: 10% weight reduction temperature (°C)<br>
Using a thermogravimetry-differential thermal analyser (product name: "TG-DTA2000", manufactured by Mac Science Co. Ltd.), testing was conducted under the following conditions: Nitrogen flow rate: 100 ml/minute, heating rate : 10°C/minute, and weight of sample: 10 mg. The higher the 10% weight reduction temperature, the greater the thermal stability the sample has.<br>
7)	Alkali resistance<br>
Using a sample prepared by grinding and mixing 0.1 g of amide-based compound mixture or all-trans compound and 0.1 g of calcium hydroxide (powder) using an agate mortar, weight reduction of the sample was measured on a<br>
thremogravimetry-dif f erential thermal analyzer (product name "TG-DTA 2000", manufactured by Mac Science Co. Ltd.) under the following conditions:<br>
Nitrogen flow rate: 100 ml/minute,<br>
Temperature : Elevated at 50°C/minute to 300 °C, and held at 300 °C for 60 minutes<br>
Weight of sample: 10 mg.<br>
The weight reduction at 5 minutes after reaching 300 °C was measured, and percent weight reduction (PWR) was calculated based on the weight of the sample. The smaller the percent weight reduction, the better the alkali resistance.<br>
Example 1<br>
(1) In a four-necked 500 ml flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a condenser and a gas inlet were placed 9.7 g of PTC (0.055 moles) and 100 g of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and the PTC was completely dissolved with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Subsequently, 20. 5 g (0.1815 moles) of 2-methylcyclohexylamine (trans isomer : cis isomer = 100.0 : 0.0, GLC composition %) , 56.3 g (0.1815 moles) of triphenyl phosphite, 14.4 g (0.1815 moles) of pyridine and 50g of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone were added thereto, and the reaction was carried out with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 4 hours at 100°C. After cooling, the reaction solution was slowly pored into a mixture of 500 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 500 ml of water, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 40 to 50°C for one hour, and white precipitate thus formed was then filtered off. The obtained white solid was washed twice with 500 ml of isopropyl alcohol at 40 to 50°C, and dried at 100°C and 133 Pa for 6 hours.<br>
The obtained dry product was pulverized in a mortar and passed through a standard sieve having openings of 106 μm (JIS Z-8801) to give 20.3 g (80% yield) of 1,2, 3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(2-methylcyclohexylamide) (hereinafter referred to as "PTC-2MeCHA").<br>
The melting point of the thus obtained white powder and the trans-2-methylcyclohexylamine residue absorbance proportion (Ctrans) were measured. Table 1 shows the evaluation results. Table 1 also shows the characteristic infrared absorptions of the obtained white solid (C=O stretching vibration (amide I absorption band) and N-H deformation vibration (amide II absorption band)), 10% weight reduction temperature and alkali resistance (PWR).<br>
(2) The unreacted 2-methylcyclohexylamine recovered after the above amidation reaction was subjected to GLC analysis to measure the trans :cis ratio thereof. It was found that the trans:cis ratio of the unreacted amine was 100:0, which was in agreement with the trans : cis ratio (100 : 0 , GLC composition %) of the 2-methylcyclohexylamine used as the starting material.<br>
The product amide obtained above, when treated at a temperature condition similar to that used in the amidation reaction (room temperature to 280 °C) , had a FT-IR spectrum and a melting point that are in full agreement with those measured before the treatment, verifying that the stereo configuration was not altered by the amidation reaction.<br>
In view of the above results, it was confirmed that the trans-configured moiety : cis-configured moiety ratio of the amide structure of the product amide-based compound of this Example 1 is identical to the trans: cis ratio (6LC%, i.e., mole%) of the amine starting material.<br>
In each of Examples 2-16 and Comparative Examples 1-16, it was confirmed in the same manner as above that the ratio of the trans-configured moiety : cis-configured moiety of the amide structure of the product amide-based compound mixture or all-trans amide-based compound was identical to the trans : cis ratio (6LC%, i.e., mole%) of the amine starting material.<br>

Further added thereto were 0.05 part by weight of tetrakis[methylene-3-(3,5-<br>
di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane (manufactured by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc . , product name : "IRGANOX 1010"), 0.05 part by weight of<br>
tris(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite (manufactured by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc. , product name: "IRGAFOS 168") and 0 . 05 part by weight of calcium stearate, and the mixture was then dry blended using a Henschel mixer for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm.<br>
The obtained mixture was subjected to melt-kneading at a resin temperature of 240° C using a single screw extruder having a diameter of 25 mm. The extruded strand was cooled with water, and the thus obtained strand was then cut, giving a polyolefin resin composition in the form of pellets.<br>
The obtained pellets were injection molded at a resin temperature of 240°C and a mold temperature of 40°C to produce polyolefin resin molded articles (test pieces) with different sizes. One of them was a test piece for measuring haze and the size thereof was 70 mm x 40 mm x 1 mm, and the other was a test piece for measuring f lexural modulus and the size thereof was 90 mm x 10 mm x 4 mm.

(TABLE REMOVED)<br><br>
The following are clear from the results shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
(1)	With regard to the thermal stability of the all-trans<br>
amide-based compounds or amide-based compound mixtures of the<br>
invention, as the content of trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine<br>
residue (or Ctrans value) increases, the melting point and the<br>
10% weight reduction temperature increase. When the content<br>
is at least 70 mole% (Examples 1 to 16) , the melting point and<br>
10% weight reduction temperature are higher than those of the<br>
amide-based compound mixtures wherein the contents are less<br>
than 70 mole% (Comparative Examples 1 to 16), exhibiting<br>
significant improvement in thermal stability of the nucleating<br>
agents themselves.<br>
Furthermore, the nucleating agents of the invention having a trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue of at least 70 mole% have improved alkali resistance, compared with the amide-based nucleating agents wherein the contents are less than 70 mole%.<br>
Polyolefin resins contain an alkaline substance (such as calcium stearate, calcium hydroxide, etc.) as'an agent for neutralizing a polymerization catalyst. Therefore, nucleating agents are required to have alkali resistance. The excellent alkali resistance of the amide-based nucleating agent of the invention is industrially advantageous.<br>
(2)	The physical properties of the molded articles are also improved with the increase in<br>
trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue content.  Specifically, as the trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue content increases, the physical properties of each molded article are improved, and even with a trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue content of 68.2 mole% or 69 mole% (Comparative Examples 1, 6, 9 and 14), excellent transparency (haze value), crystallization temperature (Tc) and flexural modulus are exhibited; however, when the trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue content is 70 to 100 mole% (Examples 1 to 16), excellent transparency, crystallization temperature and flexural modulus are substantially maintained or further improved.<br>
(3) Therefore, when the thermal stability and other properties of the amide-based nucleating agent and various properties of the molded articles are totally taken into consideration, the trans-2-alkylcyclohexylamine residue content is preferably at least 70 mole%, particularly 70 to 90 mole%, and more preferably 70 to 80 mole%.<br>
