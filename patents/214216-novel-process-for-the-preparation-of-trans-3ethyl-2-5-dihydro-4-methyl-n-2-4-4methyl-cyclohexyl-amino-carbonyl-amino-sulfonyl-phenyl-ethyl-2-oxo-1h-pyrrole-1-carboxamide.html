Preferred are hydrocarbon solvents, particularly chlorinated hydrocarbons are preferred, the most preferred solvent is dichloromethane.<br>
According to process of the present invention the step of the process wherein, 3-Ethyl-4-methyl-3-pyrrolidin-2-one is reacted with a compound of formula 2, may be carried out at a temperature between the range of 0°C to 35°C for 8 to 15 hours, preferably 12 to 14 hours. In this step of the process, the addition of a compound of formula 2 to 3-Ethyl-4-methyl-3- pyrrolidin-2-one, may be carried out in a controlled manner so as to avoid undue exothermicity. For example, 4-Nitrophenyl chloroformate (a compound of formula 2, wherein X is CI, Z is O and R is 4-nitrophenyl) may be added in different lots<br><br>
such as 60% of the quantity of 4-Nitrophenyl chloroformate may be added at a temperature range between 2°C to 10°C and 40% of the quantity of 4-Nitrophenyl chloroformate may be added at temperature range between 25°C to 35°C.<br>
According to the process of the present invention the reaction of compound of formula 3 with 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzene sulfonamide to form 4-[2-(3-Ethyl-4-methyl-2-carbonyl pyrrolidine amido)ethyl]benzene sulfonamide, a compound of formula 4, may be carried out in a solvent selected from the group consisting of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, nitriles, amides and the like. Preferably the solvent is selected from ketones, nitriles and amides. The most preferred solvent for carrying out the step b) of the process is a ketone such as acetone.<br>
According to process of the present invention the reaction of compound of formula 3 with 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzene sulfonamide to form 4-[2-(3-Ethyl-4-methyl-2-carbonyl pyrrolidine amido)ethyl]benzene sulfonamide, a compound of formula 4 may be carried out at a temperature between the range of about 35°C to 80°C for 0.5 to 20 hours, preferably at   about 60°C for 0.5 to 3 hours.<br>
