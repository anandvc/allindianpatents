DESCRIPTION<br>
HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is related to novel heterocyclic compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have blood diglycerides lowering effect, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hereinafter, referred to as ""LDL-C") lowering effect, and also blood glucose lowering effect, blood insulin lowering effect, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hereinafter, referred to as *HDL-C") increasing effect, atherogenic index lowering effect, which index is the ratio of non-HDL-C to HDL-C calculated according to the formula: (total cholesterol - HDL-C)/(HDL-C) . Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease, cerebral infarction, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis or diabetes mellitus.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The insulin resistant syndrome complicated by disorder of carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism and hypertension attracts attention as a multi-risk group of high incidence of ischemic heart disease. The insulin resistant syndrome is found in most of patients suffering from obesity and non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The metabolic disorder of lipids herein recognized is the increase in blood  diglycerides  mainly  due  to  the  increase  in<br><br>
chylomicron, very low density lipoproteins, and remnant lipoproteins which are the intermediary metabolites thereof, and the decrease in HDL-C (Diabetes, 37, 1595-1607(1988); Arch. Intern. Med., 149, 1514-1520(1989) ; Diabetes Care, 14, 173-194 (1991)).<br>
Although it has often been disserted that the blood triglyceride level is probably an important risk factor of arteriosclerotic diseases, the clear relevance has not been established. Said level, however, has been reported to be an independent risk factor of ischemic heart disease based on the results obtained recently using arteriography (Circulation, 90, 2230-2235 (1994)).<br>
It is well known that the HDL-C level negatively correlates to incidence of ischemic heart diseases from the results of a lot of epidemiological researches (Circulation, 79, 8-15(1989)), HDL is thought to participate in the reverse cholesterol transport into liver from extra hepatic tissues and demonstrated to have anti-arteriosclerosis effect in animal model experiments (J. Clint. Invest., 85, 1234-1241(1990); Nature, 353, 265-267(1991)).<br>
It has been confirmed that blood total cholesterol<br>
level, especially LDL-C level, positively correlates to<br>
incidence of ischemic heart diseases and the said incidence<br>
can be decreased by lowering the level in a large-scale<br>
intervention trial (Lipid Research Clinics Program: JAMA,<br>
251, 351(1984); Lipid Research Clinics Program: JAMA, 251,<br>
365(1984)).<br>
I Accordingly,  compounds  that  decrease  the  blood<br>
triglyceride level and LDL-C level, and also increase the<br>
HDL-C level or decrease the atherogenic index are useful as<br><br>
a remedy for arteriosclerosis, especially for prevention or treatment of ischemic heart diseases. Further, compounds that improve the insulin resistance are expected to reduce the blood glucose level and blood insulin level, and improve the pathological conditions of complications such as diabetes mellitus, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension and obesity, which can be risk factors of arteriosclerotic diseases, and whereby exert effective preventive or therapeutic activity on arteriosclerosis.<br>
It has been heretofore known that 2-aryl-5-alkyloxazole derivatives or 2-aryl-5-alkylthia2ole derivatives of the general formula (A), which have some similarity to the compounds of the present invention have blood lipid lowering effect or blood glucose lowering effect.<br><br>

For example, compounds included in the general formula (A), namely 2,4-thiazolidinedione derivatives, are reported to have blood lipid lowering effect or blood glucose lowering effect in USP 5532256, WO96/05186, JP H7-188227, A, JP S61-85372, A and USP 5401761.<br>

It is described that compounds included in the general formula (A), namely 1,2,4-oxadiazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives, have blood lipid lowering effect or blood glucose lowering effect in USP 5510360 and USP 5480896.<br>
It is described that compounds included in the general formula (A), namely carboxylic acid derivatives, have blood lipid lowering effect or blood glucose lowering effect in W099/462325, W098/00137, WO97/31907, W096/38415, JP H9-323982, A, JP H8-325264, A, JP H5-507920, A, USP 5510360 and USP 5480896.<br>
The compound of the general formula (A) is characterized in that it has:<br>
(1)  2-aryl-5-alkyloxazole ring or 2-aryl-5-alkylthiazole ring at one end;<br><br>
(2)	carboxy, 2,4-oxazolinedione"5-yl, 2,4-thiazolinedione-<br>

Effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in KK-A” Mouse<br>
The  experiment was  conducted using the  compounds<br><br>
described in the Examples as test compounds and Troglitazone (5-[4-(6-hydroxy-2,5,1, 8-tetramethylchroman-2-ylmethoxy)benzyl]-2, 4-thiazolidinedione) as a control compound.<br>
Each test compound was orally administered to KK-A” mice (10 week old, male), NIDDM model animal, for 4 days at a given dosage. On the next day of the last administration, blood was collected from tail end blood vessels under non-fasting conditions to prepare heparin! zed plasma. Thereafter, blood was collected from an abdominal large vein under pentobarbital anesthesia to prepare serum. The glucose level (BG), triglyceride level (TG) and insulin level (Ins) in plasma were measured using a glucose CII-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd), CLINTECH TG-S (latrine LABORATORIES, INC.) or triglyceride E-test WAKO (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) , and a rat insulin measurement kit (Morinaga Biochemistry Research Institute)   or   REBIS-insulin-mouse-T   (Mouse   Insulin<br>
ELI5A(TMB) KIT, Sheboygan Co.,Ltd) , respectively. Also, the  sum  of  VLDL-C  level  and  LDL-C  level  in  serum<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "(V)LDL-C") , total cholesterol level   (TC) and HDL-C level were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography system for the measurement of lipoprotein cholesterol (TOSOH CORPORATION).<br>
(V)LDL-C level was measured because VLDL-C and LDL-C cannot be measured separately. Atherogenic Index (AI) was calculated according to the following formula:<br>
AI = [(TC level)-(HDL-C level)]/(HDL-C level). The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
The present compounds showed excellent blood triglyceride lowering effect and (V)LDL-C lowering effect. Furthermore, the present compounds showed blood glucose lowering effect, blood insulin lowering effect or HDL-C increasing effect or atherogenic index lowering effect. It is clear that the present compounds are useful as a preventive or therapeutic agent for arteriosclerosis, and the like.<br><br>
