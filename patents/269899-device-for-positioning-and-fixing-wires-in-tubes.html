Device for positioning and fixing wires in tubes<br>
The invention relates to a device for positioning and<br>
fixing solid or hollow wires in tubes.<br>
In chemical reaction technology, the positioning and<br>
fixing of wires, in particular thermocouples, in<br>
tubular reactors is of great significance. It is<br>
intended to be possible to measure the temperature at<br>
various points over the entire length of the tubes.<br>
In this context, the term hollow wires also includes<br>
capillaries through which gaseous or liquid educts are<br>
introduced at a desired height into the reaction tube.<br>
These capillaries may likewise be provided as an<br>
enclosure for thermocouples which one wishes to<br>
position in the region between the holders. The<br>
capillaries can also be used for sampling during the<br>
reaction and removing the desired samples by suction.<br>
In this case, it is undesired for the positioning to<br>
necessitate drilling into the wall of the tube, which<br>
would make the effort involved in production increase<br>
to an impractical level, in particular for shell-and-<br>
tube reactors which have several thousand tubes. Feed<br>
inlets of this type would adversely influence the<br>
catalyst pellet fill, allowing channelling and<br>
inhomogeneous dynamic pressure distributions to occur.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device with<br>
which these disadvantages are avoided.<br>
The invention relates to a device for positioning and<br>
fixing solid and hollow wires in tubes (later also<br>
referred to as holders), comprising a non-closed<br>
annular element, which has a smaller cross section than<br>
these tubes, the wall of which has at least one bore<br>
for leading through a wire, in particular a<br><br>
thermocouple, and in which there is a continuous slot,<br>
preferably parallel to the extent of the tube.<br>
By expansion or compression, the diameter of the device<br>
can be adapted to that of the tube, so that it is in<br>
close contact with the wall.<br>
Depending on the dimensions of the device, it contains<br>
one or more bores for leading through wires, such as<br>
thermocouples or capillaries.<br>
Its length inside the annular device and perpendicular<br>
to the direction of the tube preferably corresponds to<br>
half the diameter of the tube, so that the temperature<br>
measurement takes place in the middle of the latter.<br>
However, other dimensions are also possible. The wires<br>
are preferably fastened to the lead-throughs by<br>
soldered joints and are led to the end of the tube on<br>
its wall, possibly clustered together. They may also be<br>
fixed on the wall inside the tube.<br>
In general, a reactor tube contains a number of these<br>
holders at suitable distances from one another, in<br>
order for example to observe the temperature profile in<br>
the tube.<br>
The configuration according to the invention has the<br>
effect of reducing the otherwise observed tendency for<br>
packings with which the tubes are generally filled, of<br>
solid material, for example catalysts, to undergo<br>
channelling when a flow passes through them.<br>
Use of the device according to the invention is not<br>
restricted to a specific type of tube or the material<br>
used for it. Tubes made of commercially available<br>
steels, such as are used for example in chemical plant<br>
construction, which have an inside tube diameter of 10<br>
to 75 mm, are suitable. Tubes with an inside tube<br><br>
diameter of 15 to 50 mm are especially suitable. Tubes<br>
with an inside tube diameter of 15 to 3 0 mm are<br>
suitable in particular.<br>
The material for the devices according to the invention<br>
is also not restricted to a specific type of wire or<br>
material. All commercially available wires are<br>
suitable; wires which are used for example in a known<br>
way as thermocouples for measuring temperatures are<br>
suitable in particular. The diameter of these solid or<br>
hollow wires may be up to 3 mm. Wires with a diameter<br>
of up to 2 mm are especially suitable.<br>
The length of the wires is not limited and is adapted<br>
to the length of the tubes. Wires with a length of up<br>
to 20 metres are especially suitable.<br>
Up to 20 wires may be led out of a tube (Figure 1;<br>
n=18) . However, it is expedient to lead up to 12 wires<br>
(n=10) out of the tube, especially preferred to lead<br>
out up to 6 wires (n=4).<br>
The fastening device preferably has the form of a non-<br>
closed annularly bent rectangle, the corners of which<br>
are preferably rounded or bevelled.<br>
The distance	between the sides of the rectangle facing<br>
towards one	another amounts to 1 to 10 mm, in<br>
particular 3	to 8 mm, depending on the diameter of the<br>
tube.<br>
The height of the rectangle generally amounts to 15 to<br>
8 0 mm, in particular 2 0 to 40 mm, depending on the<br>
diameter of the tube.<br>
The devices according to the invention are preferably<br>
drawn into the tube by means of wire pulls, the pulling<br>
wire subsequently being released and removed from the<br>
tube. The devices are no longer displaced on account of<br><br>
the clamping action on the tube wall without being<br>
subjected to force.<br>
The device is especially suitable for fixed-bed<br>
reactors in which liquid-phase or gas-phase reactions<br>
are carried out.<br><br>
