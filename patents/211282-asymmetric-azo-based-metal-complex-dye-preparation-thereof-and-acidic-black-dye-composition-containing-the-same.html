				<td>ASYMMETRIC AZO-DASED METAL COMPLEX DYE, PREPARATION<br>
THEREOF AND ACIDIC BLACK DYE COMPOSITION CONTAINING TIIE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel asymmetric azo-based metal<br>
complex dyes. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel<br>
asymmetric azo-based metal complex dyes having very deep colors as well as<br>
superior fastness, and a process for preparing such a novel asymmetric azo-based<br>
metal complex dye. Further, the present invention is concerned with an acidic<br>
black dye composition comprising the novel asymmetric azo-based metal complex<br>
dyes as a main component.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There have been developed various black dyes for dyeing polyamide fibers,<br>
such as nylon 6 and 66. Representative of the black dyes for dyeing polyamide<br>
fibers, an acidic black dye is represented by the following Formula 13:<br>
However, when the dye as above is used in an amount of 5-7 % o.w.f.,<br>
much thereof remains unfixed, which results in exhibiting inferior properties in<br>
terms of washing fastness, water fastness, sweat fastness and so forth.<br>
Although described to be applied to various fibers, including silk, woolen<br>
knitting yams, leather, synthetic polyamide fibers, etc., and be superior in fastness,<br>
the dyes in accordance with the above patent are not applicable to clothing or<br>
articles which require higher qualities of dyes. In addition, the dyes are limited<br>
mainly to the expression of reddish or orange colors. Nowhere are mentioned<br>
black dyes capable of expressing various colors.<br>
In general, black dyes may be used in mixture with shades of red, orange,<br>
and/or yellow dyes in order to enhance their black build-up effect. Dye mixtures<br>
comprising black dyes and dyes of other colors are well known from the prior arts,<br>
for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Sho. 58-160362. Hei. 2-202956 and<br>
Hei 2-73870, and U. S. Patent Nos. 5-,445,6S4, 5,092,905 and 6.126.700, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference of the present invention. Because properties of<br>
Another problem with the dye is that, because the dye is required to be<br>
rinsed many times in order to improve their fastness, much time and expense are<br>
required for treating the waste water. Particularly, the above conventional acidic<br>
black dye suffers from the disadvantage of being poor in dyeing levelness and build-<br>
up effect and inadequate color expression with cellulose fibers, natural wool fibers,<br>
and synthetic polyester fibers. Furthermore, in order to express deep colors, the<br>
conventional acidic black dye requires to be used in combination with another dye.<br>
 EP 0 384 893 Al (corresponding to U. S. Patent No. 5,229,502) discloses a<br>
 process for the preparation of at least 85% pure, asymmetric 1:2 chromium complex<br>
azo dyes and/or azomethine dyes containing at least two groups which impart<br>
solubility in water. The dyes are represented by the following Formula 14:<br>
the dye mixtures disclosed in the references are greatly dependent on the blade d e<br>
component, other properties than color expression cannot be expected to improve<br>
without improvement in properties of the black dyes used as bases.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for an improved acidic black dye that<br>
can solve the fastness problems of the conventional acidic black dyes and the<br>
economical disadvantage attributable to the additional rinsing process, and that can<br>
afford the expression of various colors in combination with other dyes, thereby<br>
having high value-added effect.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Leading to the present invention, the intensive and thorough research on<br>
acidic black dyes, conducted by the present inventor, resulted in the finding<br>
asymmetric metal complex of an acidic black azo dye, in which a disazo compound<br>
is coupled with chromium complex, capable of imparting various fibers to a very<br>
deep color and exhibiting an improved fastness, and an acidic black dye composition<br>
containing the same.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide asymmetric<br>
metal complex of acidic black dyes, which can produce deep color dyeing and are<br>
superior in fastness.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for<br>
preparing the asymmetric metal complex of acidic black dyes with ease.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a black dye<br>
composition based on the acidic black dye.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>

nitro group (NO2), a chlorine atom (Cl), a sulfoneamide group<br>
(SO2NH2) and a sulfone group (SO3); and R2, which may be the same<br>
or different, each is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
hydrogen atom (H) , a nitro group (N02), a chlorine atom (Cl) and<br>
a sulfone group (SO3) , and all the individual compounds falling<br>
within the ambit of general Formula 1 are black dyes.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a process for preparing asymmetric metal comples<br>
black dyes of general Formula 1 as defined and claimed in Claim<br>
1, which comprises -<br>

the desired black dyes as needle-shaped black crystals,<br>
which may be isolated by dialysis, suction-filtration and<br>
drying at around 40°C-60°C to produce highly pure black metal<br>
complex dye of Formula 1.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided an acidic black dye composition comprising 80-99 % by weight of the<br>
asymmetric azo-based metal complex dye represented by the Formula 1, and 1-20 %<br>
by weight of at least one dye selected from the group consisting of compounds<br>
represented by the following Formulas 9-12:known in industry.<br>
The present invention pertains to novel asymmetric azo-based metal<br>
complex dyes represented by the Formula 1, which have an absorban at a<br>
wavelength of l max 576 nm with a solubility of 100 g/1 at 90 °C. In addition, the<br>
novel dyes of the present invention may exhibit almost the same color irrespective<br>
of fiber materials. Further, the novel dyes are far superior in washing fastness,<br>
water fastness and sweat fastness over the conventional acidic black dyes when<br>
being used at the same o.w.f. rate.<br>
A description will be given of the preparation of the asymmetric azo-based<br>
metal complex of the acidic black dye, below.<br>
First, a diazonium naphthalene compound, represented by the following<br>
Formula 2, is reacted with naphthol, represented by the following Formula 3, in the<br>
equivalent ratio of 1:0.8-1.3 to produce a monoazo compound, represented by the<br>
following Formula 4.<br>
wherein R1, which may be the same or different, each is selected from the<br>
group consisting of a hydrogen atom (H), a nitro group (NO2), a chlorine atom (C1),<br>
a sulfoneamide group (SO2NH2) and a sulfone group (SO3); and R2, which may be<br>
the same or different, each is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom<br>
(H), a nitro group (NO2), a chlorine atom (C1) and a sulfone group (SO3).<br>
In detail, the diazonium naphthalene compound is dissolved in water at 0-<br>
10 °C with stirring and controlled to pH 3-5. For the pH control, sodium acetate,<br>
sodium bicarbonate, or soda ash may be used with preference for sodium acetate.<br>
Separately, naphthol is added to water and controlled to pH 10-11 at 70-90<br>
°C with a base such as sodium hydroxide, followed by cooling the solution to "0-30<br>
°C. The naphthoi solution was added to the diazonium naphthalene solution and<br>
subjected to coupling reaction at pH 10-11 for 5-6 hours with stirring, to produce the<br>
monoazo compound of the Formula 4. Then, impurities can be removed by well-<br>
known methods, for example, dialysis, suction-filtration and washing to increase the<br>
purity of the monoazo compound.<br>
To prepare a 1:1 chromium complex, represented by the following Formula<br>
5, the monoazo compound is dispersed in water and reacted with a chromium donor<br>
in an equivalent molar ratio of 1:0.8-l .3 at pH 1.0-5.0 at 125-135 °C with stirring.<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above.<br>
Suitable in the present invention is a chromium donor selected from the<br>
group consisting of chromium formate, chromium chloride and chromium oxide.<br>
Removal of impurities from the product may be achieved by a well-known method,<br>
for example, dialysis, suction-filtration and washing.<br>
Aside from the preparation of the 1:1 chromium complex, an aminobenzene<br>
compound, represented by the following Formula 6, is reacted with a phenyl<br>
naphthalene compound, represented by the following Formula 7, in the presence of a<br>
nitrite to give a disazo compound, represented by the following Formula 8. For<br>
instance, the aminobenzene compound is dissolved in water and the liquid<br>
preparation is cooled. The liquid preparation is mixed with an aqueous solution of<br>
nitrite, preferably sodium nitrite, at 0-30 °C after addition of an acid, preferably<br>
hydrochloric acid and more preferably concentrated hydrochloric acid in order to<br>
remove excess nitrite.<br>
Afterwards, an aqueous solution of phenylnaphthalene added with a base<br>
such as sodium hydroxide is added to the aminobenzene solution at such an amount<br>
that the equivalent ratio of the aminobenzene to the phenyl naphthalene ranges<br>
within 1.5-2.5:1, followed by conducting a coupling reaction at pH 9-11 for 5-6<br>
hours. The resulting solution may be further purified by dialysis, suction-filtration<br>
and washing.<br>
acidic black dye, and 1-20 % by weight of at least one dye selected from the group<br>
consisting of compounds represented by the following Formulas 9-12:<br>
Less than 1 % by weight of the auxiliary dye is too small to have any effect<br>
on bathochromicity and color change. On the other hand, when the auxiliary dye is<br>
used in an amount larger than 20 % by weight, the color fastness of the black dye<br>
itself is deteriorated.<br>
A better understanding of the present invention may be obtained in light of<br>
the following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed<br>
to limit the present invention. In the following examples, the term "parts", unless<br>
otherwise described, means weight parts.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
29.5 parts of l-diazo-2-naphthol-6-nitro-4-sulfonic acid, 100 parts of water<br>
and 100 parts of ice were mixed and stirred at 10 °C for 30 min. 2 parts of zinc<br>
chloride (ZnC l2) was added to the mixture, after which the pH of the mixture was<br>
adjusted to 3.0 with a solution of 20 parts of sodium acetate (CH3G0ONa) in 100<br>
parts of water.<br>
After 15 parts of 2-naphthol (b-naphthol) was added to 150 parts of water<br>
of 80 °C and completely dissolved with 1ON NaOH, the solution was cooled to 30<br>
°C by addition of 150 parts of ice. The mixture as prepared earlier was added<br>
thereto, mixed, and adjusted to pH 10, and then was subjected to coupling reaction<br>
at 40 °C for 5 hours with stirring. Dialysis of the product solution in a saturated<br>
saline solution afforded a monoazo compound, represented by the following<br>
Formula 15a, in the form of black crystals of needle shape, which were suction-<br>
filtered, washed with a 5 % sodium chloride solution, and dried at about 50 °C in<br>
vacuo. 43.9 parts of the monoazo compound was dissolved in 300 parts of water in<br>
the presence of 10 N NaOH and mixed with a solution of 10 parts of C1O3 in 20<br>
parts of water. The monoazo compound was reacted with the CrO3 at pH 3.0 at<br>
130 °C for 5 hours to produce a chromium complex represented by the following<br>
Formula 15b. After being cooled to 50 °C, the resulting solution was dialyzed in a<br>
saturated saline to obtain crystals, which were then sunction-filtered, washed with a<br>
5 % sodium chloride solution, and dried in vacuo.<br>
Separately, 30.8 parts of 4-nitro-2-aminophenol was mixed, along with 150<br>
parts of ice, with 150 parts of water for 30 min with stirring. Following addition of<br>
40 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid, a solution of 14 parts of sodium nitrite in<br>
40 parts of water was added to the 4-nitro-2-aminophenol solution and stirred at 10<br>
°C for 30 min. After removal of excess nitrite, the resulting solution was added<br>
with a solution (about 10 °C) of 31.5 parts of 6-amino-N-phenyl-3-sulfone-naphthol<br>
in 10 N NaOH, 200 parts of water and 100 parts of ice, and then subjected to a<br>
coupling reaction for 5 hours with stirring to give a disazo compound represented by<br>
the following Formula 15c, which was then isolated by dialysis, suction-filtration,<br>
washing with a saturated saline, and drying in vacuo.<br>
108.6 parts of the chromium complex was reacted with 64.5 parts of the<br>
disazo compound in 500 parts of water at 80 °C at pH 9 for 4 hours, followed by<br>
dialysis in NaCl to afford a dye, represented by the following Formula 15d, in the<br>
form of black crystals of needle shape, which were isolated by suction-filtration and<br>
concentration to dryness at 50 °C in vacuo. The dye was applied to nylon or<br>
polyamide fibers to give a greenish black color.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was conducted with exception of<br>
using 25 parts of l-diazo-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid, instead of l-diazo-2-naphthol-<br>
6-nitro-4-sulfonic acid, to give compound represented by the following Formula 16a<br>
and chromium complex represented by the following Formula 16b, from which a<br>
complex, represented by the following Formula 16c, was prepared finally.<br>
Application of this dye on nylon or polyamide fibers resulted in bluish black<br>
coloring.<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was conducted with exception of<br>
using monoazo compounds and disazo compounds listed in Table 1, below. The<br>
dyes thus obtained were applied to nylon or polyamide fibers and the results are<br>
given in Table 1.<br>
These dyes obtained in these examples were measured to show almost the<br>
same fastness as the dyes prepared in Examples 1 and 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 26<br>
The dye represented by the chemical formula 15d was mixed in a weight<br>
ratio of 97:3 with the dye represented by the Formula 9. The dye composition had<br>
a solubility of 100 g/1 (190 °C). Dyeings obtained by applying the resulting dye<br>
composition to polyamide fibers at an amount of 5 % o.w.f. were found to be<br>
improved in water fastness, washing fastness and sweat fastness by 2 to 2.5 grades<br>
over the conventional acidic black dye represented by the Formula 13.<br>
EXAMPLE 27<br>
The dye represented by the Formula 16c was mixed in a weight ratio of<br>
96.5:3.5 with the dye represented by the Formula 10. Dyeings obtained by<br>
applying the resulting dye composition to polyamide fibers at an amount of 5 %<br>
o.w.f. were found to be improved in the fastness to water, washing and sweat by<br>
about 2 grades over the conventional acidic black dye represented by the Formula<br>
13, and showed a bluish black color.<br>
EXAMPLE 28<br>
The dye prepared in Example 3 was mixed in a weight ratio of 94:6 with<br>
the dye represented by the Formula 9. Dyeings obtained by applying the resulting<br>
dye composition to polyamide fibers an amount of 5 % o.w.f. were found to be<br>
improved in the fastness to water, washing and sweat by about 2.5 grades over the<br>
conventional acidic black dye represented by the Formula 13, and showed a greenish<br>
black color.<br>
EXAMPLE 29<br>
The dye prepared in Example 17 was mixed in a weight ratio of 98:2 with<br>
the dye represented by the Formula 11. Dyeings obtained by applying the resulting<br>
dye composition to polyamide fibers at an amount of 5 % o.w.f. were found to be<br>
improved in the fastness to water, washing and sweat by about 2 grades over the<br>
conventional acidic black dye represented by the Formula 13, and showed a bluish<br>
black color.<br>
The dye represented by the Formula 15d was mixed in a weight ratio of<br>
96:4 with the dye represented by the Formula 12, Dyeings obtained by applying<br>
the resulting dye composition to polyamide fibers at an amount of 5 % o.w.f. were<br>
found to be improved in the fastness to water, washing and sweat by about 2 grades<br>
over the conventional acidic black dye represented by the Formula 13, and showed a<br>
bluish black color.<br>
EXAMPLE 31<br>
The dye prepared in Example 4 was mixed in a weight ratio of 97.5:2.5<br>
with the dye represented by the Formula 9. Dyeings obtained by applying the<br>
resulting dye composition to polyamide fibers at an amount of 5 % o.w.f. were<br>
found to be improved in the fastness to water, washing and sweat by about 2.5<br>
grades over the conventional acidic black dye represented by the Formula 13, and<br>
showed a bluish black color.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 TO 5<br>
Dyeings obtained using the conventional acidic black dyes 52, 222. 107,<br>
and 172, respectively on nylon, cotton, and wool fibers were measured for fastness<br>
to washing, water, sweat and chlorine, and the results are given in Table 2, below.<br>
In this regard, the fastness properties were determined according to the<br>
following standards:<br>
- Fastness to Washing (ISO 105/C03 60 °)<br>
Equipment: Launder-o-meter<br>
Temp.: 60±2 °C x 30 min<br>
Detergent (5g/l)/Na2CO3 (2 g/1)<br>
Ratio to Liquid: 50:1<br>
- Fastness to Water (ISO 105/E01)<br>
Equipment: Perspirometer (4.5 kg pressure)<br>
Temp.: 37±2 °C x 4 hrs<br>
- Fastness to Sweat (Salt) (ISO 105/E04)<br>
Equipment: Perspiration tester<br>
Temp.: 30±2 °C x 4 hrs.<br>
0.5 g of L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, 5 g of sodium<br>
phosphate, dibasic, 5 g of sodium chloride were dissolved in 1 liter of water.<br>
- Fastness to Chlorine (KS K 0725)<br>
Equipment: Perspiration tester<br>
Temp.: 38±2°Cx2 hrs.<br>
Materials were immersed in a solution having sodium perchkoate<br>
effective chlorine 0.5 g/1 of H2O, at pH 8.0±0.2 at 27.2±2 °C for 4 hours.<br>
As apparent from the data of Table 2, when the dyes of Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 5 are used in an amount of 5 to 7 % o.w.f., the dyeings are in the<br>
second or third grade in fastness to washing, water, and sweat owing to the dye<br>
residues remaining unfixed. In the dyeing industry, the conventional dyeings are<br>
washed three or four times with water to remove the unfixed dyes, thereby<br>
improving their fastness, which causes to generate a great quantity of waste water.<br>
Further, much time and expense are required for treating the waste water, thus<br>
lowering the productivity.<br>
In contrast, the dye of the present invention allows the dyeing to have<br>
superior fastness without washing in addition to imparting high dye concentrations<br>
of the dyeings. Thanks to its high dye concentration and superior fastness, the<br>
acidic black dye of the present invention can solve the pollution and economic<br>
problems from which conventional black dyes suffer. Additionally, the dye of the<br>
present invention can express various and deep colors in combination with other<br>
dyes.<br>
The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is<br>
to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of<br>
description rather than of limitation. Many modifications and variations of the<br>
present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore, it is to be<br>
understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be<br>
practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br>

varying between 50°C and 90°C and pH of 4.0-10.0, producing<br>
the desired black dyes as needle-shaped black crystals,<br>
which may be isolated by dialysis, suction-filtration and<br>
drying at around 40°C-60°C to produce highly pure black metal<br>
complex dye of Formula 1.<br>
3. The method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the chromium donor<br>
is selected from the group consisting of chromium formate, chromium<br>
chloride and chromium oxide.<br>
4. The method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the step a)<br>
comprises :<br>
dissolving the diazonium napthalene compound in water at<br>
0° to 10°C with strring ;<br>
adjusting the solution to pH 3 to 5 and adding a naphthol<br>
solution thereto so as to perform a coupling reaction between the<br>
diazonium naphthalene and the naphthol to produce the monoazo<br>
compound ; and<br>
dispersing the monoazo compound in water and coupling the<br>
monoazo compound with the chromium donor at pH 1.0 to 5.0 at 125°C<br>
to 135°C.<br>
5. The method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the step b)<br>
comprises :<br>
dissolving the aminobenzene compound at 0°C to 30°C in water<br>
with strring ; and<br>
adding a solution of the phenyl naphthalene compound in<br>
water thereto so as to perform a coupling reaction between the<br>
aminobenzene compound and the phenyl naphthalene compound at<br>
pH 9 to 11.<br>
6. A process for preparing asymmetric metal complex black dyes<br>
of general formula 1 depicted hereinbefore, wherein R1 and R2 have<br>
the same significance as defined in Claim 1, substantially as<br>
hereinbefore described with particular reference to the<br>
illustrative Examples given herein.<br>
7. An acidic black dye composition comprising -<br>
(i) 80-99% by weight of the asymmetric azo-based, acidic<br>
black metal complex dye of general Formula 1 as shown earlier,<br>
wherein substituents R1 and R2 have the same significance as<br>
given in Claim 1, and<br>
(ii) 1-20% by weight of at least one conventional cobalt or<br>
chromium complex dye selected from the group consisting of<br>
compounds represented by Formulae 9, 10, 11 and 12 shown<br>
hereafter :<br>
8. An acidic black dye composition substantially as herein<br>
described with particular reference to the illustrative Examples<br>
given hereinbefore.<br>
9. Asymmetric metal complex black dyes of general Formula 1<br>
shown above, wherein Ra and R2 are as defined in Claim 1,<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described.<br>
Conventional dyeing with acidic black dyes suffered<br>
from the fastness problems and economical disadvantages<br>
attributable to the additional rinsing process of the conventional<br>
acidic black dyes, not to speak of pollution problems resulting<br>
from the disposal of higher volume of rinsing effluents.<br>
The present invention attempts to overcome the above<br>
drawbacks and provides a novel asymmetric azo-based metal complex<br>
dye which exhibits superior high colour depth and excellent<br>
fastness, along with a process for preparing such novel compounds.<br>
This invention also relates to an acidic black dye<br>
composition which uses conventional acidic black dyes with the<br>
compounds of this invention, resulting in expression of various<br>
colours of varying shades and tints, thereby producing high<br>
value-added effect.</td>
