BACKROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to electricity metering and more particularly,<br>
to an electronic electricity meter configurable to transmit information to a central<br>
computer via a modem unit.<br>
In many electronic electricity meters, communications with a meter<br>
microcomputer can be performed via an optical port or an option board connector.<br>
For example, in some known meters, an electrical connector is provided so that<br>
various option boards, such as a telephone modem communication board, may be<br>
electrically connected to the meter microcomputer. A central computer is often used<br>
to collect data, including billing information, from the meter, using the modem<br>
communication board. The data is available from the modem communication board<br>
in a predefined format (an ANSI defined protocol) on the communication, channel<br>
which connects the option board connector to the meter microcomputer.<br>
To reduce the number of nuisance and common event, e.g., power outage,<br>
calls, it is desirable to provide a modem unit, or board, which detects conditions<br>
within the meter and exchanges information with the central computer after the<br>
condition has existed for a pre-defined period of time. It also would be desirable to<br>
provide such a unit that would allow modification of the operation parameters. It<br>
would further be desirable to provide such a modem unit which can be easily and<br>
quickly coupled to a meter while allowing programming of a security password.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, an electricity meter includes a modem circuit,<br>
or unit, coupled to the meter microcomputer which exchanges information between<br>
the meter microcomputer and a central computer of the data source. Using the<br>
signals supplied by the meter microcomputer and the central computer, the modem<br>
unit can detect various conditions within the meter and determine the proper time<br>
for exchanging the information. In one embodiment, the modem unit includes a<br>
microcomputer having a plurality of timers.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is directed to allowing the programming<br>
of meter and modem unit passwords. Specifically, the meter and modem unit are<br>
placed into a password recovery state upon detecting closure of an external switch.<br>
Closure of the external switch simultaneously places the meter and the modem unit<br>
into password recovery states so that new passwords may be programmed into the<br>
meter and the modem unit by the central computer. Such a configuration avoids the<br>
time and expense associated with deprogramming the modem unit at the meter shop<br>
or having to send a specially trained individual to the meter site to perform the<br>
reprogramming.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to limiting the number of<br>
calls initiated from the meter. More specifically, the modem unit microcomputer<br>
detects certain events and waits &amp; pre-defined period of time before initiating the call<br>
to the central computer. In one form, after the modem unit detects a power outage<br>
indicator from the meter microcomputer, the modem unit waits a programmable<br>
period of time prior to an outage call being placed to the central computer. The<br>
modem unit microcomputer may be further configured so that in order to initiate the<br>
call to the central computer several conditions must occur within a pre-defined<br>
period of time. If all of the events do not occur in the specified period of time, the<br>
call will not be made to the central computer.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to the modem unit<br>
answering calls from the central computer. More specifically, and in accordance<br>
with one form, the meter modem unit receives new program information from the<br>
central computer. The modem unit microcomputer program is stored in a non-<br>
volatile memory having two segments. A new program is stored in an inactive<br>
segment of the memory while the modem unit microcomputer executes a program<br>
from the active segment. If the programming is completed, the microcomputer<br>
changes the inactive segment to the active segment and executes the new program.<br>
However, if the programming is not completed, the modem unit microcomputer will<br>
continue to execute the program stored in the active segment. The two segments<br>
ensure that the meter will not be left in a partially programmed mode.<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention is directed to utilizing multiple<br>
meters configured in a master slave arrangement. Information is exchanged<br>
between the meters and the central computer utilizing a single telephone line. More<br>
specifically, each meter includes a modem unit having a unique identification<br>
number. Prior to exchanging information from the central computer, an<br>
identification number is transferred to the meters. Each modem microcomputer<br>
determines whether the transferred identification number matches the identification<br>
number stored in its memory. If the numbers match, that modem unit exchanges<br>
information with the central computer. Those meters which do not match the<br>
transferred identification number wait and listen for the next transferred<br>
identification number to determine whether a match exists.<br>
The above described modem unit detects multiple conditions and responds to<br>
those conditions at the proper pre-defined time to reduce the number of nuisance and<br>
common event calls. New operation parameters may also be transferred to the<br>
modem unit to allow modification of the condition and time parameters. The<br>
modem unit described above allows the password to be reprogrammed and the user<br>
does not have to pre-program the modem unit. As result, a new modem unit may be<br>
quickly installed in a meter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram illustration of an exemplary electronic energy<br>
meter 10 which, for example, is commercially available from General Electric<br>
Company, 130 Main Street, Somersworth, N.H. 03878, and generally referred to as<br>
the KV meter. The KV meter can be modified to incorporate the modem unit<br>
described below in more detail. Although the present apparatus and methods are<br>
described herein in the context of an electronic electricity meter, it should be<br>
understood that the present invention is not limited to practice with any one<br>
particular meter. The present invention can be utilized in connection with other<br>
microcomputer based meters.<br>
Referring now specifically to Figure 1, meter 10 includes voltage sensors 12<br>
and current sensors 14. Sensors 12 and 14, in operation, typically are coupled to<br>
the power lines supplying power to site at which the meter is located. Sensors 12<br>
and 14 are coupled to an analog to digital (A/D) converter 16 which converts the<br>
input analog voltage and current signal to digital signals. The output of converter<br>
16 is provided to a digital signal processor (DSP) 18. DSP 18 supplies<br>
microcomputer 20 with digitized metering quantities, e.g., V2H, I2H.<br>
Microcomputer 20, using the metering quantities supplied by DSP 18, performs<br>
additional metering calculations and functions. DSP 18 may, for example, be a<br>
processor commercially available as Model Number TMS320 from Texas<br>
Instruments Company, P.O. Box 6102, Mail Station 3244, Temple, TX 76503,<br>
modified to perform metering functions.<br>
Microcomputer 20 is coupled to a liquid crystal display 22 to control the<br>
display of various selected metering quantities and to an optical communications<br>
port 24 to enable an external reader to communicate with computer 20. Port 24<br>
may be the well known OPTOCOM™ port of General Electric Company, 130 Main<br>
Street, Somersworth, N.H. 03878, which is in accordance with the ANSI type II<br>
optical port. Microcomputer 20 may also generate additional outputs 26 used for<br>
various other functions as is well known in the art. Microcomputer 20 may, for<br>
example, be an eight bit microcomputer commercially available from Hitachi<br>
America, Inc., Semiconductor &amp; I.C. Division, Hitachi Plaza, 2000 Sierra Point<br>
Parkway, Brisbane, CA 94005-1819, modified to perform metering functions.<br>
Microcomputer 20, in one embodiment, also is coupled to an input/output<br>
(I/O) board 28 and to a function, or high function, board 30. DSP 18 also supplies<br>
outputs directly to high function board 30. Microcomputer 20 further is coupled,<br>
via a control bus 32, to an electronically erasable programmable read only memory<br>
(EEPROM) 34. I/O board 28 and high function board 30 also are coupled, via bus<br>
32, to EEPROM 34.<br>
Back-up power is supplied to the meter 10 by a power outage battery 36<br>
coupled to a wide range power supply 38. In normal operation when no back-up<br>
power is required, power is supplied to the meter components from the power lines<br>
via power supply 38.<br>
Many functions and modifications of the components described above are<br>
well understood in the metering art. The present application is not directed to such<br>
understood and known functions and modifications. Rather, the present application<br>
is directed to the methods and structures described below in more detail. In<br>
addition, although the methods and structures are described below in die hardware<br>
environment shown in connection with Figure 1, it should be understood that such<br>
methods and structures are not limited to practice in such environment The subject<br>
methods and structures could be practiced in many other environments.<br>
Further, it should be understood that the present invention can be practiced<br>
with many alternative microcomputers, and is not limited to practice in connection<br>
with just microcomputer 20. Therefore, and as used herein, the term<br>
microcomputer is not limited to mean just those integrated circuits referred to in the<br>
art as microcomputers, but broadly refers to microcomputers, processors,<br>
microcontrollers, application specific integrated circuits, and other programmable<br>
circuits.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of an exemplary modem circuit, or unit, 50 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Generally, unit 50<br>
couples to meter microcomputer 20 as described below in more detail and at least<br>
based in part on the signals present at unit 50, unit 50 can determine whether meter<br>
10 should take any action as described below.<br>
Referring now specifically to Figure 2, unit 50 includes a microcomputer 52<br>
coupled to meter microcomputer 20, a memory 54, and a modem circuit 56. Unit<br>
50 provides a communication path, or link, for exchanging data, or information,<br>
between meter 10 and a central computer 58. Microcomputer 52 includes, in one<br>
embodiment, a random access memory (RAM) 60 and a read only memory (ROM)<br>
62. Programmed parameters and operating information, or data (not shown), are<br>
stored in memory 54. Memory 54 may, for example, be a non-volatile memory<br>
device such as an electrically erasable read only memory (EEPROM), although<br>
other types of non-volatile memory devices may be used. Modem circuit 56 may,<br>
for example, be a modem chipset commercially available as Model Number<br>
RC224AT from Rockwell International Corp., Digital Communications Division,<br>
4311 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach, CA 92660.<br>
Command, response, and communication data are exchanged between<br>
microcomputer 52 and modem circuit 56. A telephone interface circuit 64 couples<br>
modem circuit 56 to a telephone line 66 so that information may be remotely<br>
exchanged between meter 10 and central computer 58. In one embodiment, modem<br>
unit microcomputer includes a timer circuit 80 having a plurality of timer circuits<br>
for measuring time. Timer circuit 80 includes a real-time clock 82, an outage timer<br>
84, an outage delay timer 86, and a call delay timer 88. Real-time clock 82<br>
generates a time value representative of the current time and date, e.g.,<br>
HH:MM:SS, MM/DD/YY. Timers 84, 86, and 88 are used for measuring the<br>
amount of time that has passed since a certain event, or occurrence of a condition.<br>
Timers 84, 86, and 88 may be programmed with an initial value and may increment<br>
or decrement in value and produce a signal when the programmed time has passed<br>
or elapsed. In an alternative embodiment, timer circuit 80 may be separate and<br>
distinct from modem unit microcomputer 52.<br>
To exchange information between meter 10 and central computer 58, and in<br>
one embodiment, a data exchange algorithm is loaded into modem unit 50.<br>
Specifically, the algorithm is loaded, and stored, in memory 62. The algorithm is<br>
then executed by microcomputer 52.<br>
A flow chart 100 illustrating process steps executed by microcomputer 52 in<br>
exchanging information between meter 10 and central computer 58 is set forth in<br>
Figure 3. More particularly, upon power up 102 of meter 10, or anytime after<br>
power is applied to meter 10, various parameters are programmed 104 into memory<br>
54. In one embodiment, the parameters include initial values for timer circuits 80,<br>
specifically, initialization of timers 84, 86, and 88, whether an outage call should be<br>
placed, how long should meter 10 wait before placing call, and whether meter 10<br>
should answer a call from the central computer 58. In addition, after the parameters<br>
are programmed and power is applied to meter 10, outage delay timer 86 is started.<br>
After programming parameters 104, microcomputer 52 monitors operations<br>
of meter 10 to determine, or detect, whether a condition exists, or a change has<br>
occurred 106 in die signals provided to modem unit 50. The conditions include an<br>
error, a caution, and a diagnostic condition. If a condition is detected 106,<br>
information is transferred, or exchanged, 108 using modem unit 50. Particularly,<br>
microcomputer 52 detects modifications of signals provided from meter<br>
microcomputer 20 to modem microcomputer 52 and in the signals provided from<br>
central computer 58. More specifically as shown in Figure 4, microcomputer 52<br>
detects 106 at least the following the conditions or changes and exchanges 108 the<br>
indicated information.<br>
Detect Condition 106 Information Exchange 108<br>
1. Password Recovery 110 Recover password 114.<br>
2. Power outage 118. Power outage call 122.<br>
3. Scheduled Status Report 126 Status Call 130<br>
4. Call from central computer 134 Answer Call 138.<br>
5. New Program 142 Update Program 146.<br>
6. Master/Slave mode 150 Master/Slave Update 154<br>
Password Recovery and Recover Password<br>
Password recovery 110 and recover password 112 refer to detecting a<br>
password recovery state and enabling programming of modem unit 50 password and<br>
meter 10 password. In one embodiment, an external switch, oerable by a user,<br>
generates a PW Recovery signal that is supplied to modem unit 50 from meter<br>
microcomputer 20. The PW_Recovery signal is supplied to microcomputer 52 in a<br>
low to high state to enable the programming of the passwords. More particularly,<br>
and referring to Figure 5, recovering password 114 includes disabling the password<br>
security 200 of modem unit 50 and placing modem unit 50 in a password recovery<br>
state 202. Disabling security 200 allows microcomputer 52 of modem unit 50 to<br>
continue to operate without having a password that matches the meter password.<br>
After modem unit 50 is placed in the recovery state 202, the same password is<br>
stored 204 in meter 10 and modem unit 50. Specifically, the passwords transmitted<br>
from central computer 58 to meter 10 utilizing modem unit 50. The passwords are<br>
then programmed in meter microcomputer 20 and modem unit memory 54. Upon<br>
completion of programming the new passwords into microcomputer 20 and memory<br>
54, the PW_Recovery signal supplied to microcomputer 52 is changed to a false, or<br>
low state by meter microcomputer 20. Password security of modem unit 50 is<br>
enabled 208 after modem unit 50 receives the new passwords.<br>
For example, if a new modem unit 50 is installed and coupled to a<br>
microcomputer 20, the meter password and the modem unit password would not<br>
match, therefore, meter 10 may not be able to be programmed to extend the<br>
functionality of meter 10. As a result of recover password 114, modem unit 50 and<br>
microcomputer 20 will have matching passwords.<br>
Power outage and power outage cell<br>
Power outage 118 and power outage call 122 refers to notifying central<br>
computer 58 when the power is removed from meter 10. A power outage signal is<br>
supplied to modem unit 50 from meter microcomputer 20 to indicate that power has<br>
been removed from meter 10. Specifically, the power outage signal supplied by<br>
microcomputer 20 changes from a false state, to a true state when power is removed<br>
from meter 10. More specifically and as shown in Figure 6, upon microcomputer<br>
52 detecting power outage 118, power is supplied 220 to microcomputer 52 from<br>
outage battery 36. Microcomputer 52 updates 222 a meter status signal which is<br>
stored in memory 54. Outage timer 84 is then started 224 and the outage delay<br>
timer is stopped and the value stored 226 in memory 54. The value of outage timer<br>
84 is then monitored 228 using microcomputer 54 to determine whether the value of<br>
outage timer 84 is within a valid range. If power is not restored to meter 10 prior to<br>
the value of outage timer 84 being within the valid range, microcomputer 52<br>
examines 230 previous outage call completed parameter stored in memory 54 to<br>
determine whether an outage call should be placed. If the previous outage call<br>
completed parameter stored in memory 54 is in a false state, a call is placed 232 to<br>
central computer 58 as described below. If, however, the previous outage call<br>
completed parameter is in a true state, microcomputer 52 examines 234 the value of<br>
outage delay timer 86 stored in memory 54 to determine whether the value is within<br>
a predefined, or valid range. If the value is within the predefined range, a call is<br>
placed to central computer 58. If, however, the value is outside the valid range,<br>
microcomputer 52 resets 238 outage delay timer 86 and waits for power to be<br>
applied to meter 10.<br>
Outage timer 84 and outage delay timer 86 may be configured to avoid<br>
nuisance outages calls caused by power transients and to alter the timing of outage<br>
calls from different meters in a common outage area. Specifically, outage timer 84<br>
may be configured to prevent calls from being made to central computer 58 until a<br>
specific amount of time has passed. In one embodiment, outage timer 84 is<br>
programmed with a value between 0, indicating no delay, and 255 seconds. If the<br>
value is programmed with a non-zero value, power must be removed from meter 10<br>
at least for that period, or valid range, of time, before microcomputer 52 proceeds.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, diagnostic tests, or checks, are delayed a<br>
selectable period of time to allow stabilization of supplying power and meter 10. In<br>
another embodiment, calls to central compute 58 are prevented until the selected<br>
period of time, for stabilization has passed.<br>
The value of outage timer 84 is altered to prevent nuisance calls from being<br>
generated from power outages having a duration less than the programmed value of<br>
timer 84. In addition, outage delay timer 86 may be configured to prevent nuisance<br>
calls from transient conditions. For example, typical outages may consist of a series<br>
of power transitions before power is completely lost and short outages may occur<br>
during normal operation due to wind blown power lines or other relatively brief<br>
disturbances. Additionally, the process of repairing local power distribution faults<br>
often produces several brief power restorations, followed by a loss of power, before<br>
power is restored permanently. In order to avoid multiple calls from being made<br>
from a plurality of meters, outage timer 84 and outage delay timer 86 may be<br>
configured to require that power be removed for a pre-defined period of time and<br>
meter 10 to have power applied for a valid range of time before an outage call is<br>
made. Specifically, if the values of both timers 84 and 86 are not within their<br>
respective valid ranges a call will not be placed to central computer 56.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, in placing a call 236 to central computer 58,<br>
microcomputer 52 initializes 250 modem circuit 56. Initialization 250 includes<br>
configuring circuit 56 to originate a call to central computer 58, defines a phone<br>
number to call for central computer 58, and defining parameters related to the baud<br>
rate, type of handshaking and other communication parameters as known in the art.<br>
If the outage call parameter is in a true state indicating that a call is to be made<br>
during a power outage condition, microcomputer 52 delays 252 a defined period of<br>
time for outage battery 36 to reach full charge. Call delay timer 88 is started 254<br>
and microcomputer 52 monitors 256 call delay timer 88 until the value of call timer<br>
equals the value, or valid range, defined during programming of parameters 104.<br>
When the value of call delay timer is within the valid range, a status report is<br>
generated 258 by microcomputer 52 and a call is placed 260 to central computer 58<br>
utilizing modem circuit 56. After the status report is generated 258, modem circuit<br>
56 supplies the status report to telephone interface 64 and telephone line 66 so that<br>
the status report is transferred to central compute 58. If a call is completed 262,<br>
modem circuit 56 supplies 264 an outage call completed signal to microcomputer 52<br>
and power is removed 266 from modem circuit 56.<br>
If the call is not completed, call delay timer 88 is reset and started 268.<br>
Upon microcomputer 52 detecting 270 call delay timer 88 being within a valid<br>
range, a second call is placed 272 to central computer 58. The second call may be<br>
placed to the same phone number as described above, or may be placed to a second<br>
phone number for central computer 58. As described above, if microcomputer 52<br>
detects 274 that the second call was completed, modem circuit 56 supplies 262 the<br>
outage call completed signal to microcomputer 52 and power is removed 264 from<br>
modem circuit 56. If the call is not completed, modem unit 50 is stopped and waits<br>
for power to be applied to meter 10. Additional configurations may also be<br>
included, e.g., meter 10 may attempt any number of calls and any number of<br>
different numbers prior to stopping.<br>
In one embodiment and as shown in Figure 8, the status report generated 258<br>
includes transferring status information, or data, from two tables stored in memory<br>
54. Specifically, microcomputer 20 periodically executes a diagnostic, or test<br>
routine to update 300 status of meter 10. The results of the diagnostic routine is<br>
transferred from microcomputer 20 to microcomputer 52 and stored 302 in a meter<br>
status table in memory 54. A modem unit status routine is executed by<br>
microcomputer 52 to update 304 status of modem unit 50. The resulting modem<br>
unit status is stored in a modem status table in memory 54. The status report<br>
generated 258 for transfer to central computer 58, includes the contents of the meter<br>
status table and the modem unit status table.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, in order to reduce the power<br>
consumption of outage battery 36, outage battery 36 powers only modem unit 50<br>
during a power outage. Specifically, in the event of a power outage, before placing<br>
260 call to central computer 58, microcomputer 52 updates the modem status table<br>
and stores the updated status in memory. Then, unneeded circuitry is placed in a<br>
low power sleep mode, until the outage call is placed. Once modem unit 50 is<br>
connected to central computer 58, the status report, including all required status<br>
information, is exchanged with to central computer 58 by transferring the meter<br>
status table and the modem status table. As a result, the time required to transmit<br>
the information is reduced which reduces power consumption of outage battery 36.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention and in one embodiment, a statistics<br>
communication algorithm is loaded in central computer 58. Specifically, the<br>
algorithm is loaded, and stored, in a memory of central computer (not shown). The<br>
algorithm is then executed by a microcomputer, or microprocessor (not shown) in<br>
central computer 58. The central computer microcomputer records statistical data<br>
related to the information exchanged between meter 10 and central computer 58.<br>
The statistical data includes status information and error information. Status<br>
information is data concerning general byte counts and data packet counts. Error<br>
information is data specifically relating the number of errors, the number of bytes<br>
associated with an error, and the number of data packets associated with the errors.<br>
At the end of exchanging information between meter 10 and central computer 58,<br>
central computer microcomputer analyzes the statistical data. If certain portions of<br>
the data meet a previously established error criteria, then the data is stored in central<br>
computer 58. The algorithm allows only data of interest to be stored thereby saving<br>
storage space and analysis time.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, in order to prevent all meters in an outage<br>
area from calling central computer 58 at the same time, the valid range of call delay<br>
timer 88 may be unique to each meter 10. In one embodiment, a random delay is<br>
generated for each meter 10. The random delay is based on the generation of a<br>
random number in a specific range from an encrypted serial number seed, or initial<br>
value. For example in one embodiment the valid range of call delay timer 84 is<br>
based on the unique serial number of meter 10. Using the meter serial number,<br>
microcomputer 52 generates a valid range for outage timer 84. Specifically,<br>
microcomputer 52 utilizes the encrypted serial number to generate the valid range<br>
for outage timer 84. The nature of the encryption is such mat two encrypted serial<br>
numbers generated from two consecutive meter serial numbers will generate very<br>
different valid ranges for outage timer 84. As a result, meters in the outage area<br>
generate outage calls at different times. The valid range of each meter 10 may be<br>
programmed to include any valid range.<br>
Scheduled Call Detect and Scheduled Call<br>
Scheduled call detect 126 and scheduled call 130 refer to detecting whether<br>
the current time, as defined by real-time clock 82, is within a programmed, or pre-<br>
defined valid range. If the value of real-time clock 82 is within the valid range, the<br>
status report, as described above, is transferred to central computer 58.<br>
Specifically, to transfer the status report, including billing information, to central<br>
computer 58, real-time clock 82 is monitored to determine whether the current time<br>
matches a value stored in memory 54. The scheduled call time value may be<br>
defined to specify a certain time, day, day of the week, day of the month, or a<br>
combination thereof. Upon detecting 126 real-time clock 88 being within the valid<br>
range, modem unit 50 initiates a call to central computer 58 as described above.<br>
The status report, including the billing information, is then transferred to central<br>
computer 58.<br>
Call from Central Computer and Answer Call<br>
Call from central computer 130 and Answer Call 138 refer to central<br>
computer 58 originating a call to meter 10. Specifically, and as shown in Figure 9,<br>
central computer 58 initiates a call to meter 10 utilizing telephone line 66. Upon<br>
detecting call, telephone interface supplies an incoming call signal to microcomputer<br>
52. If a call answer parameter is detected 300 in a true, or high state,<br>
microcomputer 52 supplies a call answer signal to telephone interface 64 and<br>
modem circuit 56 so that the call is answered 302. After answering the call from<br>
central computer 58, modem circuit 56 performs handshaking' 304 with central<br>
computer 58 so that data may be exchanged 306 between central computer 58 and<br>
meter 10. Data continues to be exchanged 306 until the completion 308 of the<br>
exchange at which time modem circuit 56 and central computer 58 each hang up 310<br>
and the call is terminated.<br>
New Program and Update Program<br>
New program 142 and update program 146 refer to transmitting a new<br>
program to meter 10 from central computer 58. The new program is transmitted<br>
from central computer 58 to meter 10 so that the new program is stored in modem<br>
unit 50. More specifically, the new program is transferred from central computer<br>
58 to modem unit 50 to alter operation of meter 10. For example, the new program<br>
may alter the time of the next scheduled call, the valid ranges for timer circuits 80<br>
and the call answer parameters, The new program may also provide new phone<br>
numbers for calling central computer 58.<br>
In one embodiment, the new program is stored in memory 54 including two<br>
segments. Prior to receiving the new program from central computer 58, the two<br>
segments are defined as an active segment containing the most recently programmed<br>
data, or program and an inactive segment containing previously programmed data.<br>
When a new program is received, the new program data is stored in the inactive<br>
segment. If the programming session is successfully completed, a programming<br>
complete signal is changed from the initialized low, or false state to a true, or high<br>
state. If the programming complete signal is detected to be in a high state the<br>
current active segment is changed to the. inactive segment and the current inactive<br>
segment is changed to the active segment.<br>
If the programming is not completed and the programming complete signal<br>
does not transition to a high state, a loss of program call may be initiated to central<br>
computer so that the programming can be completed. When central computer 58<br>
places call to meter 10, the original active and inactive segments designations will<br>
be unchanged because the new program was not successfully completed. As a result<br>
the modem unit 50 will always have a valid program, including operating<br>
parameters, so that unit 50 can continue to function properly.<br>
Master/Slave Call and Master/Slave Update<br>
Master/Slave Call 158 and Master/Slave Update 162 refer to placing a call to<br>
a group of at least two meters coupled to central computer 58 utilizing a single<br>
phone line 66. Specifically and as shown in Figure 10, meters 500A, 500B, 500C,<br>
500D, and 500 E are coupled to central computer 58 utilizing a single telephone line<br>
66. One meter, for example meter 500A, is designated as a master meter, while the<br>
remaining meters, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E are designated as slave meters.<br>
Each meter includes a unique identification number, for example stored in memory<br>
54. Information, or data, is exchanged between central computer 58 and meters<br>
500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E utilizing telephone line66.<br>
Referring to Figure 11, when a phone call from central computer 58 is<br>
directed to meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E utilizing phone line 66,<br>
meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E answer 602 call. Specifically,<br>
after master meter 500A handshakes 604 with central computer 58, meters 500A,<br>
500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E each monitor 606 an incoming message, or data<br>
packet transferred from central computer 58. The incoming message includes an<br>
identification number that corresponds to one of meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D,<br>
and 500E. Meters 500A, 5006,500C, 500D, and 500E each determine 608<br>
whether the transmitted identification number corresponds to the identification<br>
number stored in memory 54 of each meter. If the transmitted identification number<br>
matches the unique identification number stored in a meter, a transmit line of<br>
modem unit 50 of the meter matching the identification number is enabled 610 and<br>
transmit lines of modem units of all non-matching meters are disabled 612. For<br>
example, if the identification number matches the identification number of meter<br>
500C, the modem unit transmit lines of meters 500A, 500B, 500D, and 500E will<br>
be disabled. After information is exchanged between central computer 58 and<br>
enabled meter 500C, meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E monitor 606 the<br>
next incoming message. This routine continues until central computer 58<br>
terminates the call and hangs up.<br>
In addition, the master/slave configuration allows meters 500A, 500B, 500C,<br>
500D, and 500E to initiate a call to central computer 58 as described above using<br>
meter 10. Specifically, upon detecting a condition 106, one of meters 500A, 500B,<br>
500C, 500D, and 500E initiates the call to central computer 58. In one<br>
embodiment, meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E are configured so that<br>
each meter has a unique valid range for timer circuit 80 parameters and schedule<br>
time valid range. For example, to prevent meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and<br>
500E from originating calls without interrupting each other, meters 500A, 500B,<br>
500C, 500D, and 500E can be programmed to initiate calls only during a specific<br>
time window, e.g., meter 500A, 10:00AM -10:15 AM on 10/21/98, meter 500B,<br>
10:16 AM - 10:30 AM on 10/22/98, 500C, 10:45 AM - 10:59 AM on 10/22/98<br>
500D, 10:16 AM - 10:30 AM on 10/23/98 and 500E, 10:16 AM - 10:30 AM on<br>
10/24/98. Each meter has a unique time window for originating the call to central<br>
computer 58.<br>
Further, for events likely to occur simultaneously all meters within a the<br>
group, or cluster, e.g., a power failure, meters 500A, 500B, 500C, 500D, and 500E<br>
can be configured so that only one meter originates a call to central computer 58.<br>
Specifically, an initiate call parameter can programmed into modem unit 50 so mat<br>
microcomputer 52 is disabled from initiating call to central computer 58.<br>
The above described modem unit exchanges information between the meter<br>
and the central computer upon the occurrence of a condition within the meter. The<br>
modem unit microcomputer then evaluates the condition against parameters stored in<br>
memory 54. Using additional parameters, the microcomputer can then determine<br>
whether the information should be exchanged between the central computer and the<br>
meter. Also, the modem unit is configured to determine the proper time for<br>
exchanging the information between the central computer and the meter. Such<br>
modem unit is believed to reduce the number of nuisance type calls to central<br>
computer. Further, the modem unit is configured to allow the meter to remain<br>
operational despite error type conditions.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be<br>
practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>

An electronic electricity meter which, in one embodiment includes a modem<br>
board, or unit, coupled to the meter microcomputer and exchanges information<br>
between the meter and a central computer is described. Using signals supplied<br>
by the meter microcomputer and the central computer, the modem unit<br>
microcomputer can determine whether to exchange information between the<br>
meter and the central computer and the proper time at which the information<br>
should be exchanged. In an exemplary embodiment, the modem unit detects<br>
various conditions within the meter and responds by exchanging information with<br>
the central computer at a proper, or pre-defined, time. The modem unit has two<br>
different basic modes, or states, of operation. These states of operation are<br>
sometimes referred to as the call originate mode and the call answer mode. Call<br>
originate refers to the mode of the unit when a condition occurs in meter 10 and<br>
information is being transmitted to the central computer from the modem unit<br>
utilizing a telephone line. The call is originated upon occurrence, for example of a<br>
power outage to the meter. In the call answer mode, the central computer<br>
originates a call to the meter. The central computer can then transfer<br>
information to the meter, for example a new program can be stored in the<br>
modem unit memory.</td>
