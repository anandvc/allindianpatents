				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING A GERMANIUM-ZEOLITE<br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION: This invention relates to a process for making a zeolite, preferably a MFI-type structure, most preferably a ZSM-5 MFI zeolite, having germanium in the framework (hereinafter referred to as "Ge-zeolite" or, if the zeolite is ZSM-5 MFI, Ge-ZSM-5). This Ge-zeolite may be synthesized with or without using fluoride compounds. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART: Zeolite is a crystalline hydrated aluminosilicate that may also contain other metals, such as sodium, calcium, barium, and potassium, and that has ion exchange properties (Encarta® World English Dictionary [North American Edition] © &amp; (P) 2001 Microsoft Corporation). A method for preparing a zeolite comprises (a) preparing' an aqueous mixture of silicon oxide and sources of oxides of aluminum; and (b) maintaining said aqueous mixture under crystallization conditions until crystals of said zeolite form.<br>
Synthetic zeolites are normally prepared by crystallization of zeolites from a supersaturated synthesis mixture. The resulting crystalline product is then dried and calcined to produce a zeolite powder. The zeolite powder may be bound for use in certain equipment and process, e.g. fluidized bed reactor.<br>
Synthesis of a MFI-type zeolite with germanium in the framework is disclosed in "Synthesis and Characterization of Ge-ZSM-5 Zeolites, H. Kosslick et al., J. Phys. Chem., vol. 97, p. 5678-5684 (1993). Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used in the synthesis.<br>
U.S. Patent no. 5,391,287 discloses a crystalline zeolite SSZ-35 prepared with a particular templating agent. In the discussion of the background, it is noted that organocations (organic amines and quaternary ammonium cations) exert influence on the zeolite crystallization process by affecting the characteristics of the synthesis gel, e.g. modifying the gel pH. SSZ-35 may contain germanium. There is no disclosure on the effect of the pH of the synthesis gel on incorporation of germanium in the zeolite framework.<br>
U.S. Patent no. 5,073,673 discloses a process for the production of high-octane gasoline using a crystalline aluminogallosilicate obtained by hydrothermally treating a homogeneous aqueous mixture containing a source of silica, a source of alumina and a source of gallia and having a pH of 8-13 at a temperature of 150°-250°C with stirring until crystals of said aluminogallosilicate are formed. The particle size of the aluuminogallosilicate depends on factors such as the kind of the silica source, the amount of organic additives (e.g. quaternary ammonium salt), the amount and kind of the inorganic salt to be used as a mineralizer, the amount of base in the gel, the pH of the gel, the temperature of the<br>
crystallization and the rate of stirring. By appropriately controlling these conditions, crystalline aluminogallosilicate having a particle size of about 0.05-20 micron with at least 80% by weight thereof having a particle size of 0.01-10 micron may be produced. Germanium is listed as one of over thirty auxiliary components.<br>
U.S. Patent no. 4,923,594 discloses a fluid catalytic cracking process with a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst of a microporous crystalline multi-compositional, multiphase composite of SAPO-37 non-zeolitic molecular sieve and a zeolitic molecular sieve. Recipes calling for pHs of 12 or higher, e.g., sodium hydroxide as a reagent, are not desirable due to decomposition of the substrate. A lower pH is obtained by using ammonium salts as substitutes for some of the caustic. The initial gel pH of the non-zeolitic molecular sieve is weakly acidic to facilitate incorporation of the hydrolyzable metal cation form of the elements into the frameworks, and inhibiting their precipitation as hydroxides or oxides. In Example 1 the pH of the zeolitic molecular sieve was initially 4.9 and raised to 7.2. Germanium is listed as one of approximately 14 elements capable of forming a framework tetrahedral oxide in the non-zeolitic molecular sieve.<br>
It would be advantageous to have a process for making a germanium zeolite-type catalyst in which did the amount of germanium incorporated into the framework could be controlled and maximized.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a process for synthesizing a zeolite containing aluminum, silicon and germanium in the framework. The zeolite structure may be of MFI, FAU, TON, MFL, VPI, MEL, AEL, AFI, WWW or MOR, but preferably, the zeolite has a MFI structure, more preferably is ZSM-5 MFI zeolite. The Ge-zeolite is synthesized from an aqueous gel containing a silica source, a germanium source, an aluminum source and a structure directing agent in the presence of an acid, such as sulfuric acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric acid or formic acid, to control the pH of the gel in the range of 5.25 to 13.5, preferably 7.5 to 11 to maximize the amount of germanium incorporated into the zeolite framework. The reaction mixture gel is heated and stirred to form zeolite crystals and then cooled. The zeolite crystals are separated from the gel and are washed, dried and calcined.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure is a plot of the amount of germanium incorporated by weight percent versus the molar ratio of hydroxyl to alumina in the synthesis gel.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolites are known to be crystallized silicates and include structures of 10n tetrahedra, which form a three dimensional network by sharing oxygen atoms where T represents tetravalent elements, such as silicon, and trivalent elements, such as aluminum. Zeolites generally crystallize from an aqueous solution. The typical technique for synthesizing zeolites comprises converting an aqueous gel of a silica source, a germanium source and an aluminum source to zeolite crystals by a hydrothermal process, employing a dissolution/recrystallization mechanism. The reaction medium also contains structuring agents which are incorporated in the microporous space of the zeolite network during crystallization, thus controlling the construction of the network and assisting to stabilize the structure through the interactions with the zeolite components. The reaction takes place in the presence of an acid, such as sulfuric acid, acetic<br>
acid,  nitric • acid,  phosphoric  acid,  hydrofluoric  acid, hydrochloric acid or formic acid<br>
The Ge-zeolite is synthesized from an aqueous gel containing a silica source, a germanium source, an aluminum source and a structure directing agent.<br>
An example of the silica source is silicon oxide or silica (SiC&gt;2) which is available in various forms, such as silica sol, commercially available as Ludox AS-40™, precipitated silica, commercially available as Ultrasil VN3SP ™ and fumed silica, commercially available as Aerosil 200™.<br>
Examples of the aluminum source are sodium aluminate, aluminum nitrate, aluminum sulfate and pseudobohemite.<br>
Examples of the germanium source are germanium oxide, germanium isopropoxide, germanium chloride and sodium germanate.<br>
Examples of the structure directing agent are tetra n-propyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra n-propyl ammonium bromide and tetra n-propyl ammonium chloride.<br>
The initial pH of the reaction mixture is controlled to a range of 5.25 to 13.5, preferably 7.5 to 11. The final pH may be increase by 0.5 to 1.6 over the initial pH. The control of the pH of the gel is accomplished by the addition of an acid. The acid may be either organic or inorganic. Examples without limitation of the acids are hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and formic acid.<br>
The reaction mixture is heated for crystallization of the zeolite.  The temperature is in the range of 100°C to 200°C. During heating, the reaction mixture may be stirred, agitated or static. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. The zeolite crystals are separated from the gel b£ cooling, filtering, water washing and/or drying. The liquid portion of the gel may be removed by filtration, evaporation, spray drying or any other means for removing water from zeolite crystals. The zeolite crystals are washed with deionized water at ambient temperature,  preferably 0°C to 50°C,  until the pH of the filtrate is approximately 7.5. The zeolite crystals are dried in air at  90°C to  110°C for four to twenty-four hours, preferably approximately six hours.  The zeolite crystals may be calcined in air at 400° to 600°, preferably approximately 550° for three to ten hours, preferably approximately six hours.<br>
Optionally, a sodium compound may be introduced into the reaction mixture gel. Examples of the sodium compound are sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, sodium sulfate, sodium hydroxide or sodium germanate (which is also a germanium source). The sodium compound may be introduced either before or after the addition of the acid, preferably before.<br>
The gel may be "aged" before adjustment of the pH by addition of an acid. The time between forming the reaction mixture gel by combining a silica source, a germanium source, an aluminum source, a structure directing agent and water and<br>
adding the acid ("aging") may be in the range of 0 to 24 hours, preferably 1 to 15 hours. If the gel is aged, the pH may be lower than that for a non-aged gel after addition of. the same amount of acid.<br>
The silicon to aluminum atomic ratio (Si:Al) of the MFI<br>
(<br>
zeolite is preferably greater than 10:1, more preferably in the range from 20:1 to 200:1, and most preferably in the range from 25:1 to 100:1. The silica to germania ratio is present preferably in the range from 100:1 to 8:1, more preferably in the range from 50:1 to 10:1 and most preferably in the range from 25:1 to 10:1.<br>
The zeolite has average pore size preferably in the range from 2 angstroms to 100 angstroms, more preferably in the range from 2- angstroms to 50 angstroms and most preferably in the range of 2 angstroms to 20 angstroms.<br>
Noble metals, such as platinum, may be deposited on the Ge-zeolite (hereinafter referred to at Pt/Ge-zeolite or, if the zeolite is ZSM-5 MFI, Pt/Ge-ZSM-5). Pt/Ge-zeolite may be calcined to make a Pt/Ge-zeolite catalyst which may be used in a process for aromatization of alkanes having two to six carbon atoms per molecule to aromatics, such as benzene, toluene and xylene. The Pt/Ge-zeolite may be calcined in air at 200° to 500°, preferably approximately 300° for one to six hours, preferably approximately four hours. Before or after deposition of the noble metal, the zeolite may be bound by oxides of magnesium, aluminum, titanium, zirconium, thorium,<br>
silicon, boron and mixtures thereof. The process steps of binding, depositing a noble metal and calcining of the zeolite alone, with binder or with noble metal deposit can occur in any order.<br>
