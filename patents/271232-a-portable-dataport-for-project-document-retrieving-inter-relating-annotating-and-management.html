This application hereby claims the benefit of United States<br>
Provisional Application Serial No. 60/763,208, filed on January<br>
30, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a portable<br>
dataport device and method for retrieving, inter-relating,<br>
annotating and managing documents at a particular location<br>
and/or at a point of need. The View Manager of the present<br>
invention uses a methodology to logically organize (using an<br>
application's or project's defined set of parameters) and link<br>
the documents of a given project into a one or multi-<br>
dimensional grid. Also, the View Manager uses a series of <br>
scrollable-image-viewers and a caching methodology to pre-load<br>
documents connected to a currently viewed document.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There exists a need for a portable dataport and methodology<br>
for retrieving, inter-relating, annotating and managing<br>
documents at a point of need. This need has particular<br>
application in the construction industry, but also exists in the<br>
medical, information science, real estate management, design and<br>
engineering, transportation industry, plan and building<br><br>
operations, building management, emergency services, operations<br>
management and many other industries and/or fields where<br>
electronic documents must be retrieved, inter-related, managed,<br>
annotated and/or edited at a point of need.<br>
In the context of the construction industry, as an example<br>
and not by limitation, the present invention addresses economic<br>
needs that arise from an extremely competitive industry that has<br>
low profit margins. The largest cost other than subcontracts,<br>
direct work material, and direct work labor is staff to manage<br>
the project and direct the field activities. This can be as<br>
much as three and a half percent of the construction costs,<br>
which includes the cost of the staff and the taxes, insurance<br>
and benefits required. Any reduction of field staff time or<br>
reduction of field staff numbers on projects, contributes<br>
directly to the bottom line profitability of the construction<br>
company. The present invention provides more efficient<br>
operations for field staff in order to solve the above-listed<br>
deficiencies in the construction field. The same efficiencies<br>
also have benefits in other industries and fields.<br>
Information management in the construction industry, for<br>
the most part, is still in the paper, pencil and fax era. Most<br>
field superintendents currently use cumbersome documents and<br>
volumes of printed specifications to investigate conflicts,<br>
between contractors and/or subcontractors, building designs<br><br>
and/or engineering, and request the necessary information, in<br>
person, from team members. This non-automated process can be<br>
very costly and burdensome to a construction company.<br>
The single largest cost to construction companies is their<br>
labor cost, whether for management personnel or field labor<br>
personnel. The largest variable in cost of an installation is<br>
the availability of information at the point of need. The<br>
present invention derives from these cost factors and needs and<br>
the associated benefits of faster response and turn-around times<br>
and reduced cost of labor on a project.<br>
Another large cost of a construction project is the<br>
relocation of personnel from one work area to another due to the<br>
lack of necessary information being available for them.<br>
Reducing or eliminating these relocations by making the<br>
necessary information available to the user at the point of<br>
need, saves the construction company money and contributes to<br>
the company's profitability.<br>
Likewise, cost issues in the construction industry arise<br>
from post-installation repairs that arise from the lack of time<br>
to effectively handle and coordinate all issues during the<br>
construction period, including punch list or action item list<br>
concerns. The present invention is designed to help track and<br>
coordinate these issues during installation and handle them<br>
immediately by electronically notifying the proper personnel of<br><br>
the deficiency in a timely, user friendly manner, during<br>
construction, not after.<br>
A research study, conducted at Carnegie Mellon University,<br>
in 2003 indicated that the most ignored persons in the<br>
construction industry are the field staff when it comes to<br>
technological improvements to efficiency and information being<br>
made available at the point of need. Further discussions with<br>
construction industry leaders indicated that many of the<br>
mistakes that were discovered in the field installation were<br>
never corrected due to the inability to identify the issue,<br>
record it and quickly send it to the personnel that could<br>
correct it. If the issue identification, recordation and<br>
notification all were accomplished on a regular basis at a point<br>
of need, one large construction company suggested that it would<br>
save approximately $20 Million per year on return work.<br>
During this same study, students involved in the study,<br>
interviewed several superintendents and project managers to<br>
determine the most desired software within the construction<br>
industry. The students and the present inventors concluded that<br>
the need for an invention to accomplish identification,<br>
recordation and notification at a point of need on the job site<br>
was missing from development in the information technology<br>
industry.<br><br>
Currently, field issues are solved through a series of<br>
field and field office interactions (personal contact) that<br>
consume a lot of time for the field superintendents. Most<br>
contractors require their field superintendents to make two<br>
rounds through the construction site each work day. Anything<br>
that prevents this two round day from occurring, keeps the field<br>
superintendents adequately and satisfactorily performing their<br>
other assignments.<br>
The present invention provides the field superintendent the<br>
freedom to stay in the field while still having adequate access<br>
to project documents. It allows the field superintendent to<br>
spend more time solving problems and communicating with the<br>
people that can provide solutions.<br>
Other related systems have tried to solve some of the<br>
above-listed problems, yet they do not disclose, teach or<br>
suggest the solution provided by the present invention. For<br>
example, a system called, Autodesk Constructware, discloses<br>
generally a database management system for the construction<br>
industry which uploads, organizes and makes available to a user,<br>
various project documents, but only in an office environment<br>
through a hardwired, non-portable desktop requiring knowledge of<br>
computer file system management. This reference reduces the<br>
confusion sometimes caused by communication between the job site<br>
and the office. Further, the Autodesk Constructware system<br><br>
provides a web-based viewer for document sharing and viewing.<br>
Similar to Autodesk Constructware, Skematelc also provides a<br>
construction document management service. The Skematek system<br>
requires users to have an in-depth knowledge of file system<br>
management. Skematek's service eliminates the need for a user<br>
to compile, copy and distribute copies of construction documents<br>
and further electronically archives the documents in a logical<br>
fashion. This system also discloses the ability to link<br>
documents, such as owner's manuals and warranty documentation,<br>
with construction drawings. However, neither of these two<br>
systems provide the benefits and/or advantages disclosed within<br>
the present invention, including, in particular, the View<br>
Manager's capabilities, user-friendliness, quick navigation<br>
between project documents and portability.<br>
Another related reference, U.S. Publication number<br>
2005/0198354 Al, to Holloway, Jr., teaches a job site<br>
communication system and computer program used for remotely<br>
communicating documents between a job site and a remote server<br>
or to persons outside of the job site. This system comprises a<br>
hand held computer device, which allows the user to view and, to<br>
some extent, make very limited annotations on the documents and<br>
CAD drawings, which the user can then transmit off-site. The<br>
transmission process in this Patent Publication requires almost<br>
expert knowledge of computers, including electronic<br><br>
transmission, emailing and attachments, whereas the present<br>
invention's View Manager and field communication tool is very<br>
user friendly and requires only novice computer knowledge. The<br>
system disclosed in this Patent Publication also provides the<br>
user with the ability to communicate with off-site personnel, as<br>
needed. However, this system does not disclose a View Manager<br>
and other related features of the present invention, which allow<br>
a user to easily navigate between inter-related documents and/or<br>
layers on a particular document.<br>
Further, Patent Publication, US 2004/0201622 Al, to Rhodes<br>
et al., teaches a document distribution system which provides<br>
free form routing of documents through a system. The<br>
flexibility of this routing is provided by facilities which<br>
allow recipients, as well as the originating user, to modify the<br>
document routing through the system. Recipients also have some<br>
limited ability to annotate the documents. Again, in this<br>
reference, the user friendly View Manager, communication tools<br>
and related features of the present invention are not disclosed,<br>
taught or suggested.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a general object of this invention to provide a<br>
portable dataport and method for retrieving, inter-relating,<br>
annotating and managing documents at a particular location<br>
and/or at a point of need. More specifically, using what is<br><br>
described further below as a View Manager, it is an object of<br>
the present invention to provide, at a particular site, in a<br>
field of use, the mobility of documents that have been, (i)<br>
electronically coded with document data in an at least a one-<br>
dimensional grid system, (ii) inter-related and (iii) linked to<br>
shorten the time required to access the documents. A related<br>
object of the present invention is to provide an interconnection<br>
between project documents and the ability to place the related<br>
documents into a queue, in a manner that permits associated<br>
documents to be retrieved within a short time period using<br>
portable dataport technology or the like. Yet another object of<br>
the present invention is to permit the user to keep notes and<br>
reminders (i.e. Snapshots, Bookmarks, Permanent Record<br>
Annotation Layers or the like) electronically attached, either<br>
permanently or non-permanently, to a specific document, whereby<br>
these notes and reminders can record information which may be<br>
accessed at some future point in time.<br>
The View Manager of the present invention uses software to<br>
logically organize (using an application's or project's defined<br>
set of parameters) and link the documents of a given project<br>
into a one- or multi-dimensional grid. This View Manager uses a<br>
series of scrollable-image-viewers and a caching methodology to<br>
pre-load documents, into the dataport's viewer, connected to the<br>
currently viewed documents. In a preferred embodiment, the View<br><br>
Manager uses a document Bean that contains meta-data about a<br>
particular document and a path to that document's particular<br>
image file. In addition to the meta-data, references may also<br>
be made to one or more Snapshots, Bookmarks, Permanent Record<br>
Annotation Layers or the like. A preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention uses a Java programming language, but the<br>
invention is not limited to use of Java. Any other programming<br>
language that has the ability to create background threads, or<br>
the like, to load connected documents or document layers that<br>
run without the knowledge of the user can be used and are within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
In operation, the View Manager allows a user to easily<br>
navigate between connected, inter-related and/or linked<br>
documents, or the like. Preferably, the View Manager is also<br>
responsible for four or more distinct tasks, namely, project<br>
loading, loading a document not already cached, loading a<br>
document that has been cached and zooming the currently<br>
displayed document. However, the zooming feature can be<br>
eliminated and the View Manager will still function properly and<br>
be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide<br>
a field or project site communication tool and method,<br>
associated with the portable dataport of the present invention<br>
that permits the user to communicate, track and exchange<br><br>
documents and other information, with other interested parties<br>
or intended recipients, electronically or by similar means. It<br>
is important to note that the user of the present invention is<br>
not required to have a working knowledge of computers,<br>
electronic transmission, email, field requests for information<br>
and/or email attachments to use the present invention because of<br>
its user friendly nature.<br>
As a result of the field communication tool, the present<br>
invention provides further improved communication results that<br>
are twofold: 1) improved communication of project or case<br>
issues, including, for example, job site deficiency<br>
notifications, to interested and/or responsible parties, and 2)<br>
quick/complete communication of field requests for information<br>
from the document authors, designers or other individuals in a<br>
particular industry or field.<br>
Of particular application to the construction industry (and<br>
by analogy to other applicable industries or fields of use), the<br>
present invention has a further object of changing the<br>
methodologies currently employed by field or job site personnel<br>
to solve conflicts and miscommunications at construction job<br>
sites and/or project sites and thereby streamline the field<br>
investigation and initial communication with other related<br>
parties to the project. More specifically, the present<br>
invention: (1) improves the identification, recordation and<br><br>
notification of field or other issues and the timing of a<br>
response by other personnel; (2) replaces the "pencil and paper"<br>
methodologies currently employed in the construction or other<br>
industries, to a digitized system for quick submission and<br>
proper record keeping at a job site and/or project site; (3)<br>
permits field staff to quickly access all construction or other<br>
documents at the point of need; (4) allows the user or field<br>
superintendent to easily navigate from one type of document, for<br>
a particular field, industry or trade to another at the same<br>
portion or stage of the project or to move to an adjacent stage<br>
of the project in any of the specialized trades, fields or other<br>
areas associated with the construction or other industries; (5)<br>
allows field staff to solve issues quickly without having to<br>
return to a field office trailer or carry bulky paper<br>
documentation with them; and, (6) allows a user to capture the<br>
documents reviewed and apply notes, reminders, changes and/or<br>
comments to the documents and then request information from<br>
other members of the job site team via the field communication<br>
tool. As a result, the present invention reduces the need for<br>
multiple field staff personnel on smaller projects and reduces<br>
the number of field staff personnel on larger projects by up to<br>
fifty percent or more.<br>
Specifically, what is provided in one embodiment of the<br>
present invention is a method of using a portable dataport for<br><br>
document retrieving, inter-relating, annotating and managing,<br>
comprising the steps of loading electronic documents onto an<br>
electronic document storage device associated with the portable<br>
dataport, and using an at least one-dimensional grid of the View<br>
Manager. The grid corresponds to related document fields for<br>
navigation to related documents. Optionally, the View Manager's<br>
grid can be a two, three or more dimensional grid. The View<br>
Manager is electronically linked to the electronic document<br>
storage device to retrieve, inter-relate, annotate and manage<br>
documents. The electronic document storage device can be<br>
integral with or external to the portable dataport.<br>
The portable dataport is preferably a tablet personal<br>
computer, a notebook personal computer or a desktop personal<br>
computer. This portable dataport preferably retrieves documents<br>
through a design grid view or a design details table view, and<br>
further provides users with the ability to toggle back and forth<br>
from a currently viewed document to a previously viewed<br>
document.<br>
The View Manager of the present invention, further,<br>
provides the ability to: take a Snapshot of a particular<br>
document, or portion of a document, to Bookmark a document, to<br>
create and organize a Permanent Record Annotation Layer attached<br>
to the document and to create and organize an action items list<br>
with respect to any particular document or set of documents.<br><br>
The Snapshot, Bookmark and Permanent Record Annotation layers<br>
are recorded and track as transparent overlays of a document,<br>
such that annotations can be made to the document. The portable<br>
dataport additionally inter-relates and electronically links the<br>
Permanent Record Annotation Layers, action item lists, Snapshots<br>
and Bookmarks, to create a field request for information.<br>
Further provided is the step of using an optional field<br>
communication tool to track and communicate these field requests<br>
for information to the intended recipients.<br>
The portable dataport can also optionally be wirelessly<br>
synchronized with a remote, host server to provide the dataport<br>
with the ability to load real-time documents. This wireless<br>
synchronization is used to access and store up-to-date secondary<br>
project elements, such as, but not limited to, users, contacts,<br>
security access, software and developmental tools. The portable<br>
dataport also provides a photograph taking function, a voice<br>
recognition function and the ability to order materials from the<br>
field.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, provided is<br>
a method of using a portable dataport for document retrieving,<br>
inter-relating, annotating and managing, comprising the steps of<br>
converting a population of documents into an electronically<br>
codeable format, coding the electronic documents with document<br>
data and related document fields. The invention further<br><br>
comprises the step of loading electronic documents onto an<br>
electronic document storage device associated with the portable<br>
dataport and using a View Manager, having at least a one-<br>
dimensional grid. The grid corresponds to related document<br>
fields for navigation to the related documents. The View<br>
Manager is electronically linked with the electronic document<br>
storage device to retrieve, inter-relate, annotate and manage<br>
the documents.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
provided is a method of using a portable dataport for document<br>
retrieving, inter-relating, annotating and managing, comprising<br>
the steps of, coding electronic documents with document data and<br>
related document fields. The method further comprises the step<br>
of loading electronic documents onto an electronic document<br>
storage device associated with the portable dataport. The<br>
method uses a View Manager, having at least a one-dimensional<br>
grid and two scrollable image viewers. The grid corresponds to<br>
related document data for navigation to related documents. The<br>
View Manager is electronically linked with the electronic<br>
document storage device to retrieve, inter-relate, annotate and<br>
manage the documents.<br>
In yet another alternative embodiment of the present<br>
invention, provided is a method of creating and using a View<br>
Manager, running on a portable electronic device, comprising the<br><br>
steps of, coding electronically stored documents and related<br>
document data. The coding is accomplished through at least two<br>
scrollable-image-viewers and caching the electronically stored<br>
documents. The method further comprises the steps of loading<br>
the coded electronic documents onto an electronic document<br>
storage device associated with the portable electronic device,<br>
and archiving the electronically stored documents in the at<br>
least one-dimensional grid for viewing. The grid is at least<br>
one-dimensional and corresponds to relevant document fields for<br>
navigation to related documents. Further comprising the step of<br>
inter-relating each archived document with other related<br>
documents on the at least one-dimensional grid. This embodiment<br>
of the present invention provides the user the ability to<br>
navigate from the archived document, currently being viewed, to<br>
the related documents using one or more navigation buttons on<br>
the portable electronic device.<br>
Also provided herein is a portable dataport for document<br>
retrieving, inter-relating, annotating and management comprising<br>
an electronic document storage device associated with the<br>
portable dataport, for storing a population of coded electronic<br>
documents. Further provided is a View Manager, having at least<br>
a one-dimensional grid, the grid corresponds to related document<br>
fields for navigation to related documents. The View Manager is<br>
electronically linked with the electronic document storage<br><br>
device to retrieve, inter-relate, annotate and manage the<br>
documents. The electronic document storage device can be<br>
external or internal to the portable dataport in various<br>
embodiments. The View Manager of the present invention can<br>
optionally use a two, three or more dimensional grid.<br>
The portable dataport is preferably a tablet personal<br>
computer, a notebook personal computer or a desktop personal<br>
computer and retrieves documents preferably through a design<br>
grid view and/or a design details table view. The portable<br>
dataport allows a user to toggle back and forth from a currently<br>
viewed document to a previously viewed document. Further, the<br>
portable dataport has a Snapshot, a Bookmark, an action items<br>
list, and a Permanent Record Annotation Layer component. The<br>
Snapshot, Bookmark and Permanent Record Annotation Layer are<br>
represented and recorded as a transparent overlay of currently<br>
viewed document such that annotations can be made to the<br>
document. The portable dataport can not only create the action<br>
items list, but also, has the ability to organize it.<br>
The present invention further comprises the ability to<br>
inter-relate and electronically link Permanent Record Annotation<br>
Layers, action item lists, Snapshots and Bookmarks together to<br>
create a field request for information and use an optional field<br>
communication tool to track and communicate a field request for<br>
information to intended recipients.<br><br>
The portable dataport further comprises components to<br>
wirelessly synchronize itself to a remote, host server to<br>
provide the ability to download real-time documents. This<br>
wireless synchronization is used to access and store up-to-date<br>
secondary project elements, such as users, contacts, security<br>
access, software and developmental tools. Additionally, the<br>
portable dataport has a materials ordering component for use<br>
while still in the field. The portable dataport can also take<br>
photographs and recognize human voice input.<br>
While the invention is specifically described with<br>
reference to the construction industry, it is not limited to<br>
such and is applicable in many other fields and industries where<br>
electronic document retrieval, inter-relation, annotation and<br>
management is needed or helpful.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The invention will now be described in detail in relation<br>
to a preferred embodiment and implementation thereof which is<br>
exemplary in nature and descriptively specific as disclosed. As<br>
is customary, it will be understood that no limitation of the<br>
scope of the invention is thereby intended. The invention<br>
encompasses such alterations and further modifications in the<br>
illustrated device and method, and such further applications of<br>
the principles of the invention illustrated herein, as would<br>
normally occur to persons skilled in the art to which the<br>
invention relates.<br>
Any reference to a "document", "image" or "sheet" in the<br>
below description refers to documents, sheets, meeting minutes,<br>
sketches, drawings, images, records, data compilations, x-rays,<br>
correspondence, notes and/or any other documents being used in a<br>
particular industry, field or area.<br>
Figures 1-31 demonstrate the portable dataport and the<br>
method of the present invention, in various embodiments, that<br>
the user follows to solve informational issues at a particular<br><br>
site or for a particular project. By using the present<br>
invention, the user keeps the field operations moving and<br>
progressing each day. The present invention though the use of<br>
its View Manager (described below), specifically provides<br>
efficiency for field installation labor by readily providing the<br>
missing information to field superintendents and reducing the<br>
need to relocate workers to another work area due to missing<br>
necessary information. In sum, the portable dataport of the<br>
present invention permits the field staff or other personnel to<br>
work more effectively, completely, and efficiently.<br>
In general, before the electronic document storage device<br>
associated with the portable dataport can be loaded, a<br>
population of documents first is converted into an<br>
electronically codeable format. Next, the electronic documents<br>
are coded with document data using an at least one-dimensional<br>
grid. Each dimension of the grid system corresponds to relevant<br>
electronic document fields. Then, the electronic documents are<br>
loaded onto, or otherwise transmitted to, the electronic storage<br>
device associated with the portable dataport of the present<br>
invention. The electric document storage device is either<br>
internal or external to the portable dataport. The portable<br>
dataport then interacts with the electronic document storage<br>
device, through a View Manager, to retrieve, review and<br>
communicate notations, changes and comments to the coded<br><br>
electronic document data. The portable dataport can optionally<br>
be a tablet personal computer, a notebook personal computer, a<br>
portable or any other computer or electronic device that can<br>
provide document viewing, retrieval, inter-relation annotation,<br>
management and transmission.<br>
The present invention can also allow personnel on the<br>
project team to work more efficiently due to clearer<br>
communications regarding the requested information. In<br>
particular, alternative embodiments of the present invention<br>
provide time saving opportunities to its users in identifying<br>
problems by using the steps of: investigating an immediate<br>
solution to the problem with the electronic documents that are<br>
loaded onto the electronic document storage device associated<br>
with the portable dataport; requesting information from a remote<br>
interested party, showing the party where the answer was<br>
previously sought in the available electronic documents; and,<br>
requesting an answer from the remote interested party. A<br>
process that could take several hours to several days is now<br>
greatly shortened.<br>
As set forth above, a key feature of the present invention<br>
is the View Manager (see e.g., Figures 5, 6, 7 and 11). This<br>
feature inter-relates documents to each other, by trade, by<br>
floor or the like, in the construction industry, or other<br>
criteria in other industries, to allow a user to easily navigate<br><br>
from a currently viewed document to surrounding or related<br>
documents, areas, fields or trades. For example and not by<br>
limitation, the View Manager can inter-relate a document to<br>
other related documents for the floors above and below (or areas<br>
adjacent) in the same trade or optionally in a different trade<br>
or area. The View Manager feature can also relate a document to<br>
another trade on the same floor.<br>
The document inter-relationship software and/or methodology<br>
of the present invention, known as the View Manager, logically<br>
organizes the documents " of a project into an at least one-<br>
dimensional grid (see Figure 5). In another preferred<br>
embodiment, a two-dimensional grid is shown in Figure 6. This<br>
grid, in yet another preferred embodiments, can have three (see<br>
Figure 7) or more dimensions in order to suit any application in<br>
any industry or field. The View Manager uses a series of<br>
scrollable-image-viewers and a caching methodology to pre-load<br>
documents connected to the currently viewed image.<br>
As an example and not by limitation, Figure 5 shows a one-<br>
dimensional project representation by trade. Assume the user<br>
selected the Ml.2 document to view. The Ml.2 document is<br>
retrieved from the file system and displayed to the user in a<br>
scrollable-image-viewer. The connected documents, in this case<br>
A1.2 to the West, P1.2 to the East are all loaded in the<br>
background and placed in their own scrollable-image-viewer. If<br><br>
the user chooses to navigate to one of these connected<br>
documents, the additional scrollable-image-viewer is shown to<br>
the user, effectively removing any lag time due to loading a<br>
desired image from the file system.<br>
Assume that the user has elected to navigate from the Ml.2<br>
document to the East. The scrollable-image-viewer containing the<br>
P1.2 document is shown to the user. The scrollable-image-viewer<br>
containing the Ml.2 document, the formerly displayed document is<br>
now labeled as the new West image and saved. The remaining<br>
documents previously loaded are now removed from memory because<br>
they can no longer be directly reached from the new document,<br>
P1.2 Since the document located at P1.2 is on the edge of the<br>
grid and no document exist to the Bast, that navigation button<br>
is disabled and the scrollable-image-viewer reserved for the<br>
East remains empty.<br>
As an example and not by limitation, Figure 6 shows a two-<br>
dimensional project representation by floor and by trade.<br>
Assume the user selected the Ml.2 document to view. The Ml.2<br>
document is retrieved from the file system and displayed to the<br>
user in a scrollable-image-viewer. The connected documents, in<br>
this case Al.2 to the West, P1.2 to the East, Ml.3 to the North,<br>
and Ml.l to the South are all loaded in the background and<br>
placed in their own scrollable-image-viewer. If the user<br>
chooses to navigate to one of these connected documents, the<br><br>
additional scrollable-image-viewer is shown to the user,<br>
effectively removing any lag time due to loading a desired image<br>
from the file system.<br>
Assume that the user has elected to navigate from the Ml.2<br>
document to the East. The scrollable-image-viewer containing the<br>
P1.2 document is shown to the user. The scrollable-image-viewer<br>
containing the Ml.2 document, the formerly displayed document is<br>
now labeled as the new West image and saved. The remaining<br>
documents previously loaded are now removed from memory because<br>
they can no longer be directly reached from the new document,<br>
P1.2 However, the scrollable-image-viewers of these now<br>
orphaned documents are reused and loaded with the documents<br>
connected to PI.2, specifically, PI. 3 to the North, and Pl.l to<br>
the South. Since the document located at PI.2 is on the edge of<br>
the grid and no document exist to the East, that navigation<br>
button is disabled and the scrollable-image-viewer reserved for<br>
the East remains empty.<br>
As an example and not by limitation/ Figure 7 shows a<br>
three-dimensional project representation by floor, by trade and<br>
by shop or design drawings. Assume the user selected the Ml.2<br>
document to view. The Ml.2 document is retrieved from the file<br>
system and displayed to the user in a scrollable-image-viewer.<br>
The connected documents, in this case Al.2 to the West, P1.2 to<br>
the East, M1.3 to the North, M1.1 to the South, and M2.2 to the<br><br>
forward direction are all loaded in the background and placed in<br>
their own scrollable-image-viewer. If the user chooses to<br>
navigate to one of these connected documents, the additional<br>
scrollable-image-viewer is shown to the user, effectively<br>
removing any lag time due to loading a desired document from the<br>
file system.<br>
Assume that the user has elected to navigate from the<br>
document located at M1.2 to the East to the P1.2 document. The<br>
scrollable-image-viewer containing the P1.2 document is shown to<br>
the user. The scrollable-image-viewer containing the Ml.2<br>
document, the formerly displayed image, is now labeled as the<br>
new West document and saved. The remaining previously loaded<br>
documents are now removed from memory because they can no longer<br>
be directly reached from the new document, P1.2. However, the<br>
scrollable-image-viewers of these now orphaned documents are<br>
reused and loaded with the documents connected to the P1.2<br>
document, specifically, P1.3 to the North, P1.1 to the South,<br>
and P2.2 to the forward direction. Since the P1.2 document is on<br>
the edge of the grid and no image exists to the East, that<br>
navigation button is disabled and the scrollable-image-viewer<br>
reserved for the East remains empty.<br>
Each document within a given project is represented within<br>
the View Manager software of the present invention, by a data<br>
structure, known in Java language as a Bean. Each document Bean<br><br>
contains meta-data about the given document as well as the<br>
absolute path to the actual image file located within the user's<br>
local file system. When the database is queried for information<br>
on a given document, a document Bean is returned. The document,<br>
however, is preferably not loaded into memory at the time of<br>
database query.<br>
The present invention makes use of Java's ability to create<br>
threads that run in the background without the knowledge or<br>
direction of the user. A thread is a program's path of<br>
execution. Java language allows for a multi thread environment<br>
even though there may only exist one processor within the<br>
computer, portable dataport or like device itself. Within a<br>
graphical environment, Java reserves 1 thread, known as the<br>
event thread, for painting and updating of the user interface.<br>
In addition to meta-data about the document itself (name,<br>
number, coding etc.), each document Bean optionally contains 1<br>
or more references to Snapshots, 1 or more references to<br>
Bookmarks, 1 or more references to as-built layers or Permanent<br>
Record Annotation Layers, and 1 or more references to punch-<br>
lists, action item lists, or, in a construction setting, the<br>
present invention permits these several types of notes or<br>
markings to be "drawn" onto or attached to the document in a<br>
transparent layer format. These notes or markings include, but<br>
are not limited to, a Snapshot, a Bookmark and an As-Built<br><br>
and/or Permanent Record Annotation Layer. All of these notes or<br>
markings can be annotated by the user.<br>
Snapshots are images derived from portions of the original<br>
document (see Figure 16). These Snapshots are displayed in their<br>
own window within the View Manager. Essentially, they provide<br>
an invisible or transparent drawing layer on top of and attached<br>
or linked to the document, allowing the user to virtually<br>
annotate the document, while keeping the original document image<br>
in tact. An additional area is provided below the document for<br>
further notes (see Figure 16)• The Snapshot feature specifically<br>
identifies the location and magnification of detail of the<br>
document, creates a copy of the document and permits annotation<br>
on that particular portion of the document. The Snapshot<br>
feature is essentially a working version of the document stored<br>
on a separate transparent layer connected to a particular<br>
portion of the document. Snapshots are generally not<br>
permanently attached to a document, but only attached until the<br>
issue, causing the Snapshot to be taken, is resolved. However,<br>
even after these Snapshots are resolved and unattached from the<br>
document, they are still permanently saved and tracked for<br>
record keeping purposes.<br>
Bookmarks act as sticky notes or transparent layers affixed<br>
to the original document (see Figure 15). These bookmarks allow<br>
the user to make notes and annotations on the sticky note or<br><br>
transparent layer itself rather than on the original document.<br>
Bookmarks retain information about their position on the<br>
document they modify, as well as the scale of the document at<br>
the time of Bookmark creation. Bookmarks, once saved, are hidden<br>
from view in ordinary circumstances, but are still accessible<br>
through a document properties panel.<br>
As-built layers or Permanent Record Annotation Layers act<br>
as another invisible or transparent layer that is placed<br>
directly on or attached to the document itself (see Figure 15) .<br>
The user can annotate the as-builts, or Permanent Record<br>
Annotation Layers, without affecting the original document or<br>
image. Once saved, the invisible layer is hidden from view but<br>
is still accessible through a document properties panel. Unlike<br>
the other two note or layer features mentioned above, this<br>
marking, optionally, is permanent and stays with the document<br>
for printing and turnover to the client, owner or other<br>
individual or entity.<br>
The present invention further permits the naming of these<br>
notes and markings (see Figure 22) to allow the user to send<br>
them as attachments to other personnel in the contractor's,<br>
architect's, engineer's, owner's and/or subcontractor's offices<br>
through use of the field communication tool (see figures 23-30)<br>
or FRFI. Also included is a screen feature that provides for<br><br>
the displaying of all of these notes or markings items on the<br>
same document (see Figure 22).<br>
The View Manager is preferably responsible for four<br>
distinct tasks, namely, 1) project loading, 2) loading a<br>
document not already cached, 3) loading a document that has been<br>
cached, and 4) zooming the currently displayed document. Each<br>
task is discussed in further detail below. The zooming step can<br>
optionally be eliminated from the View Manager and the View<br>
Manager will still function as intended and still be within the<br>
scope of the present invention. There tasks are discussed more<br>
fully below.<br>
Project Loading<br>
The unique key for the project is passed to the View<br>
Manager and all documents for the project are returned from the<br>
database and/or electronic document storage device. Each<br>
document has an x, y, and optionally a z coordinate assigned to<br>
it during project creation, using the admin-console. In a one-<br>
dimensional project, one of the x or y values is set to one and<br>
the z value is eliminated, so that a methodology of project<br>
creation is the same, with respect to the x or y values, as a<br>
two or more dimensional grid. In a two-dimensional project, only<br>
one of the x, y or z values is set to one, so that a one, three<br>
or more dimensional project is created using the same<br>
methodology. In a three or more dimensional project, the x, y<br><br>
and z (and others for dimensions 4, 5, 6, etc.) coordinates have<br>
a value and are not equal to one.<br>
A Hashmap, which is a data structure that stores<br>
information in a key/value pair, is then created containing each<br>
document Bean returned from the database and/or electronic<br>
document storage device. Each document Bean uses a<br>
concatenation of its x, y, and z coordinates, hereafter referred<br>
to as the NavigationKey, as its key within the map. This map is<br>
hereafter referred to as the MasterDocumentMap.<br>
In the three-dimensional embodiment, for example and not by<br>
limitation, once the project is loaded from the database, seven<br>
scrollable-image-viewers are created, one for the currently<br>
viewed document and one representing each direction reachable<br>
from the current image: North (+1 on the y-axis), South(-1 on<br>
the y-axis), East{+1 on the x-axis), West(-1 on the x-axis),<br>
forward (+1 on the z-axis), and backward(-1 on the z-axis). The<br>
directions on the each various axis can be changed to suit a<br>
particular application. A two-dimensional version does not have<br>
scrollable-image viewers along one of the x, y or z-axis and<br>
therefore this embodiment comprises only five scrollable image<br>
viewers. In a one-dimensional project there would be three<br>
scrollable-image viewers, one for the currently viewed document<br>
and two for movement along one of the x, y or sometimes<br>
optionally the z axis.<br><br>
Any other number of scrollable-image-viewers can be used<br>
for any number of dimensions needed in a particular project and<br>
still be within the scope of this invention.<br>
Next, a Hashmap hereafter referred to as the<br>
MapScrollPanes, is created containing each of the scrollable-<br>
image-viewers, with a key equal to the number of the given<br>
scrollable-image-viewers (i.e. key="scrollablel",<br>
value=scrollable-image-viewer #1) . A second Hashmap is also<br>
created, hereafter referred to as MapKeys, containing the<br>
"cardinality key" (North, South, East, West, backward and<br>
forward in a three-dimensional embodiment) (preferably North,<br>
South, East and West in a two-dimensional embodiment and only<br>
North and South or East and West in a one-dimensional<br>
embodiment) as the keys with the values being the keys used in<br>
the MapScrollPanes' Hashmap.<br>
Finally Java's Cardlayout is used to layout the three,<br>
five, seven or other number of scrollable-image-viewers into a<br>
single panel. Cardlayout acts as a Hashmap of sorts, requiring<br>
a key value for each component added. These components are then<br>
stacked on each other so the user only sees a single component.<br>
The present invention uses the keys from the MapScrollPanes'<br>
Hashmap as the keys to the Cardlayout. In addition to the three,<br>
five, seven or other number of scrollable image viewers, an<br>
empty panel is added as the fourth, sixth, eighth or other<br><br>
numbered card with a special key that is not to be a part of any<br>
of the Hashmaps discussed above. This empty panel is used as a<br>
device to keep the user interface clean. Additionally, the<br>
empty panel is used to hide the zooming and scrolling which<br>
might cause the document image to appear temporarily distorted.<br>
Once the document image is appropriately zoomed and scrolled to<br>
the appropriate position, the empty panel is hidden, exposing<br>
the desired document image.<br>
Loading a Document Not Currently Cached<br>
The following discusses the steps involved with loading a<br>
document that is not currently cached (see generally Figure 4).<br>
The document is then retrieved from the file system, scaled to<br>
fit the viewable area and displayed to the user. In addition,<br>
the documents that are directly connected to the selected<br>
document are found and loaded from the file system as well.<br>
This method is invoked in several ways: 1) a document's icon is<br>
clicked within the grid view or the details view; 2) when the<br>
document is selected from the quick-jump dialog box, the user is<br>
allowed to select any document within the given project; and, 3)<br>
when a Bookmark, Snapshot, as-built layer and/or Permanent<br>
Record Annotation Layer is selected for viewing, the associated<br>
document is loaded, scaled, and scrolled to the appropriate<br>
viewing position. A reference to the selected document is<br>
passed to the View Manager, and then the following steps occur:<br><br>
•	Reference to the passed document Bean is saved internally<br>
as the currently viewed document.<br>
•	The main viewable panel is flipped to the empty card.<br>
•	All as-built layers, or more generally, Permanent Record<br>
Annotation Layers and Bookmarks are cleared from the<br>
scrollable-image-viewers.<br><br>
•	The document Bean referenced by the currently viewed<br>
document reference is loaded. This consists of passing the<br>
referenced document Bean to the View Manager, which in<br>
turn, determines the type of resource the given document<br>
references (jpg, gif, tiff or the like) and calls the<br>
appropriate document image loading mechanism to properly<br>
load the document's image into memory.<br>
•	An array of preferably two, four or other number of<br>
background threads (depending on whether the project being<br>
loaded has one, two, three or more dimensions) is setup,<br>
hereafter referred to as the BackgroundLoadTasksArray. Each<br>
thread represents one direction away from the currently<br>
viewed document. This consists of the following:<br>
•	Using the NavigationKey of the document referenced by the<br>
currently viewed document, increment or decrement the<br>
appropriate x, y, or z value by 1 and search the<br>
MasterDocumentMap for a match. If a match is not found,<br>
increment or decrement the value again and recheck.<br><br>
Continue this loop until a specified threshold has been met<br>
(preferably the number of documents in the project).<br>
•	If a match is found for the generated NavigationKey,<br>
instantiate one of the worker threads for the document is<br>
referenced by the new NavigationKey. The background thread<br>
loads the image referenced by the document in the same<br>
manner described above. This thread is only created in<br>
this step. It is not to be started at this time.<br>
•	An array of two, four, six or other number of Boolean<br>
flags are also created, hereafter referred to as<br>
NavButtonsStatusArray, representing each direction (e.g. N,<br>
E, S, W, FWD, REV, depending again on how many dimensions<br>
the project requires) from the currently viewed document.<br>
As connected drawings are found and background threads are<br>
instantiated, the Boolean flag for that direction is set to<br>
true. This array is used to enable/disable the navigation<br>
buttons on the toolbar.<br>
•	The size of the viewable area is determined and the<br>
document is scaled so that it appropriately fits the<br>
screen.<br>
•	The properties panel is populated with the meta-data for<br>
the document referenced by the currently viewed document.<br>
•	The status of the navigation buttons is updated based on<br>
the values in NavButtonsStatusArray.<br><br>
•	The documents image for the document referenced by<br>
currently viewed document, now in memory, is painted in the<br>
appropriate subclass of the AbstractView. This subclass is<br>
then placed inside the scrollable-image-viewer reserved for<br>
the currently viewed document.<br>
Next, determine if any Bookmark, as-built layer or<br>
Permanent Record Annotation Layer was selected to view. If<br>
so, load with the Bookmark window, if necessary, and scroll<br>
and scale the document to that of the last save of the<br>
Bookmark, as-built layer or Permanent Record Annotation<br>
Layer.<br>
•	Then, flip the main viewable panel from the empty card to<br>
the card holding the scrollable-image-viewer reserved for<br>
the currently viewed document.<br>
Finally, start any threads within the<br>
BackgroundLoadTasksArray. These background threads are<br>
subject to the rules governing the pool of threads<br>
currently available within the application.<br>
Loading a Document Currently Cached<br>
This method is used when the user has chosen to navigate to<br>
one of the documents connected to the currently viewed document<br>
that has been already loaded from the file system in a<br>
background thread (see generally Figure 3). The following steps<br>
occur:<br><br>
•	The scale of the currently viewed document is saved.<br>
•	The (x, y) coordinate of the upper left corner of the<br>
viewable area is saved if the document is larger than the<br>
viewable area.<br>
•	All as-builts or Permanent Record Annotation Layers and<br>
Bookmarks layers are cleared from the scrollable-image-<br>
viewers.<br>
•	A new background thread is created.<br>
•	All orphaned documents are unloaded. Orphaned documents<br>
consist of all documents previously loaded into memory that<br>
are not connected to the new document being viewed.<br>
•	The MapKeys Hashmap is rearranged. For example, if the<br>
user chooses to navigate East, the cardinality key,<br>
referencing the scrollable image viewer holding the East<br>
document, now becomes the currently viewed document. The<br>
formerly viewed document now becomes the West document, and<br>
the formerly West document (now orphaned via the above step)<br>
is used to hold the future East document.<br>
•	The reference held by currently viewed document is set to<br>
the new user chosen document.<br>
•	The BackgroundLoadTasksArray is setup, as described above,<br>
using the NavigationKey of the new document referenced by the<br>
currently viewed document.<br><br>
•	The properties panel is populated with the meta-data or<br>
other document data for the document referenced by the<br>
currently viewed document.<br>
•	The status of the navigation buttons is updated based on<br>
the values in NavButtonsStatusArray.<br>
•	The scrollable-image-viewer, currently holding the already<br>
loaded new document, is retrieved for the desired direction<br>
and the scale saved above is applied and the viewable area is<br>
scrolled to the (x, y) coordinates saved above.<br><br>
•	The plumb-line correction value is adjusted, if available.<br>
•	The main panel is flipped to the card containing the<br>
document for the desired direction.<br>
Any background threads are started within the<br>
BackgroundLoadTasksArray. These background threads are<br>
subject to the rules governing the pool of threads currently<br>
available within the application.<br>
Zooming the Currently Displayed Document (Optional)<br>
The View Manager is responsible for all of the zooming<br>
features within the application. The actual image representing<br>
the currently viewed document is maintained in memory,<br>
preferably, at actual size (100%) . The appropriate scale of the<br>
image is calculated, and a second image is created from the<br>
first, with the calculated scale applied. It is this second<br>
image that is painted in the scrollable image viewer. By<br><br>
generating a second image from the original image, the present<br>
invention does not experience any loss of clarity that would<br>
arise from scaling the same image multiple times. The<br>
calculated scale is saved internally and is used as a parameter<br>
in the calculations for the next zoom operation.<br>
There are at least four optionally built in zooming<br>
operations that perform the calculations to determine the<br>
appropriate scale to pass to the algorithm described below.<br>
Zoom-In - multiply the current scale by 1.25.<br>
Zoom-Out - multiply the current scale by 0.8<br>
Zoom-Box - based on the box created by the user,<br>
derive the scale by dividing the current viewable size in<br>
pixels in both the x and y direction by the x and y<br>
dimensions of the user created box. The scale used is the<br>
lesser of the two values; either the x or y.<br>
Zoom-Fit - derive the scale by dividing the current<br>
viewable size of the document's image in pixels in both the<br>
x and y direction by the x and y dimensions of the image at<br>
actual size. The scale used is the lesser of the two<br>
values, i.e., either x or y.<br>
Once the desired scale has been determined, the following<br>
steps occur, preferably, in order:<br>
• The main viewable panel is flipped to the empty card.<br><br>
•	The future "display center point" is determined. Given the<br>
calculated scale and the current center point of the viewable<br>
area in relation to the overall image, multiply the x and y<br>
values by the scale.<br>
•	A new image is generated based on the calculated scale and<br>
then the new image is painted into the scrollable image<br>
viewer.<br>
•	The image is scrolled to ensure that the calculated "display<br>
center point" is centered within the viewable area.<br>
•	The main viewable panel is flipped from the empty card to<br>
the card holding the scrollable-image-viewer reserved for the<br>
currently viewed image.<br>
•	The status bar is updated with the new scale of the image.<br>
To view a specific area of the document, a Zoom Box or<br>
magnification of detail tool is available. To use the Zoom Box,<br>
a user highlights the area of the document that he/she wants to<br>
see more clearly. The user can also, optionally, do several<br>
Zoom Box enlargements at any time and quickly navigate back to a<br>
full screen to locate another area quickly.<br>
A few examples of how the present invention improves the<br>
related systems are provided below. These examples, while<br>
related generally to the construction industry, are not limited<br>
to the same and apply to other fields. The construction<br>
industry is merely used as a preferred embodiment herein and is<br><br>
not intended to limit the present invention's application<br>
specifically to the construction industry.<br>
EXAMPLE A. A sheet metal contractor is installing ductwork<br>
and comes to an area where the ductwork is supposed to occupy a<br>
space already occupied by the fire protection system and<br>
electrical conduit. Currently, this issue is brought to the<br>
attention of the field superintendent as he or she performs his<br>
or her daily walk-through. The field superintendent manually<br>
checks the date on the documents that the sheet metal contractor<br>
is using to be certain that they are using the latest revisions<br>
to the document. The field superintendent then retreats to the<br>
field office to check the date on the latest set of shop<br>
documents and checks the shop documents for the interfering fire<br>
protection and electrical construction. Once this lengthy<br>
process is completed, the field superintendent determines who<br>
has made the error and solves the problem by gathering the<br>
necessary contractors and returning to the location in the field<br>
where the conflict occurred. During this meeting, the<br>
electrical contractor and the fire protection contractor share<br>
the documents that each is using to build their respective<br>
aspect of the project, with the field superintendent. The field<br>
superintendent must then again return to the field office to<br>
again check the date on the shop documents of the electrical and<br>
fire protection subcontractors. If both contractors in this<br><br>
example are using the latest documents and a solution cannot be<br>
found, a request for information is made to the project managers<br>
of the affected contractors or to the general contractor.<br>
Solution. The portable dataport and methodology of the<br>
present invention is designed to solve this litany of efforts by<br>
permitting the field superintendent to solve the problem while<br>
in the field or to ask the proper questions using the FRFI<br>
method initiated from the portable dataport of the present<br>
invention in the field. Thus, in example A above, if the<br>
ductwork contractor was installing duct work and came to an area<br>
where fire protection and electrical work was installed, the<br>
field superintendent is now able to retrieve and review the<br>
current documents using the portable dataport at the point where<br>
the issue arose. He or she is also able to make annotations,<br>
comment, changes or edits on the documents or layers attached to<br>
the documents while still in the field, saving the construction<br>
company a great deal of money in overhead and management time in<br>
that the conflict is resolved much quicker.<br>
EXAMPLE B. The field superintendent is reviewing the<br>
project during the twice daily walk-through when he or she<br>
notices that the blocking and electrical work in a wall, that is<br>
to be covered up the following day, is missing. Using current<br>
systems, the field superintendent tracks down, via radio,<br>
portable telephone or other means, the appropriate foremen of<br><br>
each of the trades affected to resolve the problem. The field<br>
superintendent also records the issue in a note book to be<br>
reminded later if contact with the relevant foreman was not<br>
made.<br>
Solution. The portable dataport's software is designed to<br>
quickly solve the issue in example B by using the Snapshot<br>
method. This feature allows the user to take a real-time<br>
Snapshot of a portion of any document on the portable dataport,<br>
and add a note, edit, change or annotation related to that issue<br>
that can then be immediately sent via the FRFI method to the two<br>
or more relevant contractors. By using the present invention,<br>
the field superintendent can now notify both relevant<br>
contractors immediately upon recognition of the problem and<br>
quickly resolve the issue or even prevent the issue from<br>
escalating or arising all together.<br>
As these examples demonstrate, the portable dataport of the<br>
present invention not only makes information immediately<br>
available to those who need to know, but also keeps records of<br>
each of these information transactions, optionally using its<br>
servers for recordation, tracking and backup. The construction<br>
industry in general is a very litigious industry, and as such,<br>
accurate record keeping and notifications become very important<br>
to both owners and contractors involved in litigation. The<br>
records produced from the present invention enable some of the<br><br>
alternative dispute resolution processes to be more effective in<br>
preventing escalation to litigation.<br>
In this context, important feature of the present invention<br>
is the ability, through use of the View Manager, to quickly<br>
navigate through a set of documents, records, drawings notes,<br>
meeting minutes, sketches, plans, specifications or any other<br>
documents needed for a particular industry while in the field<br>
and/or while on the job site. The relationship buttons,<br>
conveniently located on the portable dataport and/or its<br>
viewable screen, keypad or anywhere else on the dataport,<br>
permits the quick navigation between related documents. The<br>
relationship buttons further include the feature of toggling<br>
back and forth from a currently viewed document to a previously<br>
viewed document. This feature of the present invention is<br>
particularly valuable in that the user is not waiting for<br>
downloads or files that are too complex to be viewed and<br>
navigated in a timely manner. By pushing the "up", "down",<br>
"left", "right", "forward", and/or "back" buttons, the user can<br>
easily navigate between related documents while preferably<br>
maintaining the exact same or similar location on the electronic<br>
document and at the exact or similar magnification or level of<br>
detail as the currently loaded electronic document. Ultimately,<br>
this feature helps the user easily navigate quickly by focusing<br><br>
on the information required and not the retrieval, zooming and<br>
scrolling of documents.<br>
This relationship forming is done for both design documents<br>
and shop documents produced by trade contractors. The View<br>
Manager further permits the user to quickly navigate through the<br>
documents to solve a particular field or project issue.<br>
For example, and not by limitation, if a field supervisor<br>
wanted to retrieve a base document on a particular floor and by<br>
a particular trade, the user presses the jump to button and<br>
makes a selection either by floor or by trade (see Figure 18) .<br>
However, if a detail residing within that document needs to be<br>
reviewed, then the user presses the quick jump button, selects<br>
the drop down menu or writes and/or types in the desired<br>
document using the portable dataport's hand writing recognition<br>
area on or around the bottom of the viewable screen. The View<br>
Manager can also inter-relate documents outside of the<br>
construction context in other industries without references to<br>
floors or trades.<br>
More specifically, there are two buttons that assist the<br>
user in the operation of the present invention. The first is a<br>
relationship button that permits the user to select documents<br>
describing a different floor or level of the project installed<br>
in the portable dataport. By pushing the jump to button, the<br>
user can select to jump "by floor" (see Figure 18), to load<br><br>
another document into the View Manager at the exact same or<br>
similar location and at the exact same or similar magnification,<br>
zoom or level of detail as the currently loaded electronic<br>
document. This permits the user to navigate to and view the<br>
areas above, below, around, or related to the currently viewed<br>
document.<br>
The present invention further provides a relationship<br>
button that permits the user to select "by trade" (see Figure<br>
18), to load a different trade on the same floor or level<br>
currently in the View Manager. For example, a user can easily<br>
switch from electrical to plumbing. By pushing the jump to<br>
button, the user can select another trade that is loaded into<br>
the View Manager at the same or similar location and at the same<br>
magnification, zoom or level of detail as the currently loaded<br>
document. This permits the user to view other trade<br>
installations in the area of the current view. This<br>
relationship button accomplishes the same jump to feature to<br>
documents developed by the trades for the designed<br>
installations.<br>
The jump to "by trade" and "by floor" buttons can be<br>
replaced with any other jump to button for any other industry or<br>
field, while still functioning in the same manner and while<br>
still be within the scope of the present invention. In other<br>
industries or fields, the jump to feature can be loaded into the<br><br>
viewer at the same or similar location, magnification, zoom or<br>
level of detail or, optionally, at a different location,<br>
magnification, zoom or level of detail, depending on the<br>
particular needs of an industry or field.<br>
The Jump-To feature (see Figures 18 and 19) allows a user<br>
to navigate to another document via a two step process that<br>
narrows down the possible Jump-To points. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the user is presented with a choice to jump in<br>
either the horizontal direction (optionally by trade) or<br>
vertical direction (optionally by floor). Once a selection is<br>
made, the user is presented with all of the documents that are<br>
connected to the current document in a given direction. More<br>
specifically, if the user chooses to jump by trade, the current<br>
floor remains constant and the user is presented with a choice<br>
of all documents within the grid of the View Manager that have<br>
the same floor value. In other industries or fields a user can<br>
jump in any direction by any other relevant criteria<br>
Another feature that assists the user in the operation of<br>
the present invention is the quick jump button (see Figure 20).<br>
The quick jump button is used in loading the viewer with a<br>
document that does not have an entire layout as its background.<br>
For instance, there are many documents that have details on them<br>
that relate to a plurality of other documents. In this case,<br>
the quick jump feature is optionally used to find a detail that<br><br>
is noted on the document that is currently displaced in the View<br>
Manager. The user is then able to toggle back and forth between<br>
the currently viewed document and the detailed document that has<br>
additional information regarding the issue being investigated.<br>
Further, the quick-jump feature (see Figure 20) also allows<br>
the user to make a single jump anywhere within the grid of the<br>
View Manager. The user is presented with a drop down box<br>
containing all documents with the grid. This drop down box list<br>
is optionally in alphabetical order or otherwise in an easily<br>
navigable fashion. Once a selection has been made, the "loading<br>
a document not currently cached" (see Figure 4), described<br>
below, is employed to load the document.<br>
To permit the quick viewing of each document, the present<br>
invention provides an extensive magnification of detail<br>
capability. The "zoom in", "zoom out", "zoom box", and "zoom<br>
fit" features (see Figure 14) assist the user in quickly<br>
navigating each document to locate the area where a problem<br>
needs to be resolved. It is also preferable for the document to<br>
be of the correct file type and size or at least be able to be<br>
modified to the correct file type and size so that the zoom<br>
features can function as described.<br>
To improve the viewable portion of the present invention a<br>
"full screen toggle" button (see Figure 14) is provided to<br>
enlarge the viewed area for users. This feature proves to be<br><br>
quite useful when explaining to others on the site, the solution<br>
to a particular issue.<br>
Optionally, a Home button, or the like, quickly returns the<br>
user to the main hierarchy of the View Manager for easy<br>
selection of another document.<br>
The present invention further incorporates a Search<br>
capability (see Figures .21-22) of all the Snapshots, As-Builts<br>
and/or Permanent Record Annotation Layers, Bookmarks, and Action<br>
Items recorded during the project for use with the field<br>
communication tool (see Figures 23-30) or FRFI method and for<br>
use with future needs of the field superintendent to review past<br>
document investigations.<br>
The Permanent Record Annotation Layer, Snapshot and<br>
Bookmarks features, using the View Manager, are represented by<br>
an invisible and/or transparent overlay of a document such that<br>
annotations can be made to the document. These features can<br>
optionally be used to communicate project data and information<br>
requests to third parties.<br>
Throughout the project, information is typically gathered<br>
to develop an as-built layer or Permanent Record Annotation<br>
Layer (see Figure 17) at the conclusion of the project. These<br>
Permanent Record Annotation Layers or as-builts become<br>
permanently attached to the full original document. Using the<br>
as-built or Permanent Record Annotation Layer buttons, or other<br><br>
similar button, of the present invention, the information is<br>
gathered electronically and attached as a layer to the specific<br>
point on the document or to the document generally for<br>
production to the designers or owners at the conclusion of the<br>
project. The present invention eliminates the need to have a<br>
separate set of documents at the site or elsewhere to keep<br>
updated for the as-builts or Permanent Record Annotation Layers.<br>
This feature permits the information to be applied to future<br>
generations of documents since it is applied to a layer<br>
preferably above, but optionally below, but still attached, to<br>
the document.<br>
The user is also able to "remember" the documents and views<br>
visited and the magnification or level of detail that was in the<br>
viewer at the time of the request, by requesting a Snapshot (See<br>
Figure 16) of the view. A Snapshot is a "to do" reminder which<br>
is associated, but not permanently linked with a specific<br>
portion of a document. It differs from a Permanent Record<br>
Annotation Layer because it is specifically and non-permanently<br>
attached to a portion of the document, not to the document in<br>
general. The Snapshot can be optionally communicated to others<br>
on the project, so that they can provide solutions to staff,<br>
using the field communication tool (see Figure 30). The field<br>
communication tool utilizes email, fax or other electronic<br>
communication or transmission.<br><br>
A Bookmark button (see Figures 15 and 21) is used to create<br>
a note that is attached to a specific portion of a document.<br>
This can include text or hand-drawn sketches that help identify<br>
what is needed or what was done by the field superintendent. It<br>
is recorded the same way as the Snapshot feature and can be<br>
communicated using the field communication tool (see Figures 23-<br>
30) or the FRFI method of the present invention. The optional<br>
field communication tool of the present invention is very user<br>
friendly and requires only novice knowledge of computers and/or<br>
electronic transmission means. This user friendliness is a key<br>
aspect of the field communication tool of the present invention.<br>
Another key aspect of the present invention is that the<br>
field or project staff is provided with these features and<br>
related communication solutions, while they are in the field or<br>
on site, eliminating multiple trips to a site or field trailer.<br>
In the event that the missing necessary information is not<br>
within the electronic documents on the electronic document<br>
storage device associated with the portable dataport, the<br>
present invention, in an alternative embodiment, quickly<br>
collects the reviewed Permanent Record Annotation Layers,<br>
Bookmarks, Snapshots or the like and creates a Field Request for<br>
Information (FRFI), optionally, to be immediately submitted to<br>
the design professional, document designer or other recipient<br>
via the field or project site communication tool which utilizes<br><br>
electronic transmission, email, fax or other electronic<br>
communication (see Figures 23-30) . Each FRFI is numbered for<br>
tracking purposes and an optional report is provided as to the<br>
status of each FRFI on a daily, weekly, monthly basis or at any<br>
other time increment. The design professional or other<br>
recipient opens the electronic transmission, using email or<br>
other standard viewing software. Depending on the availability<br>
of the design professional or other recipient, the turn around<br>
time is significantly shortened when compared to related art<br>
systems. An important feature of the present invention is its<br>
ability to quickly forward the FRFI, preferably from the field<br>
or project site, to the appropriate designer or other intended<br>
recipient so that it is not forgotten and so that it does not<br>
fall through the cracks as it may have in the past.<br>
In addition, at the end of every project is the task of<br>
developing a punch list or action items list of the work that<br>
needs to be corrected for the project to be completed. The<br>
invention can incorporate an action items list or punch list<br>
option which preferably is activated late in a project to enable<br>
field staff to generate and distribute the list. This feature<br>
also aids in the recordation of the punch list or action items<br>
list on a daily basis and helps to issue the list to each of the<br>
involved parties. This action items list is developed,<br><br>
annotated and sent to the responsible or intended parties<br>
through the field communication tool.<br>
By way of general summary, the portable dataport of the<br>
present invention and/or its software and/or methodology has the<br>
following attributes, a portion of which are available as "addons"<br>
in alternative embodiments: the association of electronic<br>
documents; the retrieval of electronic documents, from the<br>
electronic document storage device associated with the portable<br>
dataport, for viewing; the recordation and annotation of<br>
electronic documents viewed; the sketching of solutions for<br>
review; the bundling of electronic documents viewed; the<br>
electronic transmission of the electronic documents to the<br>
relevant or intended persons; the creation or organization of an<br>
action items list or punch list; the creation of as-built or<br>
Permanent Record Annotation Layers; the searching of recorded<br>
views; the utilization of a field or project field communication<br>
tool to submit a FRFI; the creation and tracking of FRFI logs;<br>
the creation of electronic document records on the host server<br>
or electronic document storage device associated with the<br>
portable dataport; the optional ability to be updated wirelessly<br>
by a server; and, creating an inter-relationship between related<br>
electronic documents.<br>
Also within the scope of the present invention are the<br>
following optional attributes of the portable dataport: the<br><br>
generation of daily reports and action items lists; the<br>
generation of daily time sheets for labor; the ordering of<br>
materials, while in the field or on the project site; the Radio<br>
Frequency Identification Tag Locator for determining a user's<br>
location in a building or structure; the voice recognition<br>
feature; the photograph taking feature; the Leadership Energy<br>
Environmental Design (LEED) work sheets and/or blank forms<br>
provided on the dataport for easy tracking; the collaboration<br>
with other software; and, the synchronization with an optional<br>
remote host server to provide the ability to download or upload<br>
real-time documents onto the portable dataport, wherein the<br>
synchronization is used to access and store up-to-date<br>
secondary project elements such as but not limited to uses,<br>
contacts, security access, software, developmental tool or any<br>
other project element that could be used for a particular<br>
industry, area or field. These features can be modified for use<br>
in any industry, area or field.<br>
Currently, the hardware and/or portable dataport being used<br>
for the delivery of the software and documents is the Itronix<br>
Duo-Touch, which is set up with specified memory, Windows<br>
Software, communication and Tablet Software, however, any<br>
similar hardware and/or portable dataport or other computer is<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
The present invention optionally further comprises an<br>
optional server, preferably housed in a server farm as<br>
outsourced support. Optionally, the server is housed on site<br>
for a project, or can be housed internally with the present<br>
invention's provider. The portable dataport is manufactured by<br>
an outsourced supplier building the portable dataport to certain<br>
specifications. The Internet service provider is preferably<br>
accomplished through one of the existing cell phone service<br>
providers, but can also use other services. The invention<br>
preferably operates by developing strategic partnerships with<br>
each of these above-mentioned entities to provide superior<br>
service to clients and/or owners.<br>
It is important to note that the portable dataport and/or<br>
View Manager of the present invention is not dependant on any<br>
server to function properly. All the documents and document<br>
data can optionally be placed directly on the electronic storage<br>
device associated with the portable dataport, eliminating the<br>
need for an external server.<br>
The present invention anticipates a holistic approach to<br>
field/paper document management. The holistic approach means<br>
that the client and/or owner sends their documents (hard copy<br>
or electronic) to the present invention's operation where a<br>
technician or other individual places the documents into a<br>
document matrix; aligns their corners; optionally stores them on<br><br>
a server (the documents can also be loaded directly onto an<br>
electronic document storage device associated with the portable<br>
dataport and the server can be eliminated in some uses); loads<br>
them onto a portable dataport platform; sends the portable<br>
dataport platform to a field superintendent; trains the field<br>
superintendent; optionally remains connected through wireless<br>
communications (where available and where a server is used);<br>
updates the documents as requested by a client and/or owner,<br>
loads shop documents as requested by a client and/or owner;<br>
keeps all Snapshots, Bookmarks, and as-built or Permanent Record<br>
Annotation Layers backed up on the optional server or on the<br>
electronic document storage device; and, at the conclusion of a<br>
project, downloads the documents (from the optional server or<br>
the electronic document storage device) with all Snapshots,<br>
Bookmarks, and as-built layers or Permanent Record Annotation<br>
Layers attached and installs them onto a DVD, CD, disk or other<br>
hard drive and sends them the client and/or owner for record<br>
keeping purposes.<br>
Other uses for this technology in the field or at a project<br>
site are speedy solutions to requests for information and FRFIs,<br>
green building record keeping, daily construction reports, daily<br>
time sheets, material requisitions, photographic record keeping<br>
and any other related uses.<br><br>
Although this invention was created with the construction<br>
industry in mind, it should also be considered applicable to<br>
many other industries wherein an organized electronic<br>
relationship of a plurality of documents is critical to the<br>
successful accomplishment of a task. The present invention, for<br>
example, could be used in at least the medical, information<br>
science, real estate management, design and engineering,<br>
transportation industry, plan and building operations, building<br>
management, emergency services, operations management and many<br>
other industries and/or fields where electronic documents must<br>
be retrieved, inter-related, annotated, managed and/or edited at<br>
a point of need.<br><br>
