SYMBOL RECOVERY FROM AN OVERSAMPLED HARD-DECISION BINARY STREAM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	L	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The   present    invention   relates    generally   to    communications.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to symbol recovery from a binary data<br>
stream.<br>
[0003]	II.       Description of the Related Art<br>
[0004]	A received signal comprising a symbol stream may not be time aligned<br>
with the receiver.   In such a case, the receiver needs to know when to sample the<br>
received signal in order to accurately recover associated data with lowest probability<br>
of error.<br>
[0005]	Typically, a delay-locked loop is used to identify transitions which<br>
occur in the received signal.    This enables sampling to occur away from such<br>
transitions.<br>
[0006]	The delay-locked loop is a general-purpose solution to the timing<br>
recovery problem that yields moderate performance. However, when the received<br>
signal contains some pre-defined sequences of transitions that are known to both<br>
transmitter and receiver, one can do better than the general-purpose delay-locked loop<br>
by utilizing a priori knowledge of the signal content In other words, to determine the<br>
correct timing alignment, the received message can be correlated against a pre-defined<br>
sequence of data known by the receiver to be present in the received message. This<br>
technique is referred to as the "sync word correlation" method of timing recovery,<br>
where "sync word" denotes the pre-defined sequence of data.<br>
[0007]	For oversampled received signals, {e.g., 1 Mbps   information signal<br><br>
sampled at 12 MHz) there may be many oversamples that correspond to each<br>
information symbol. Thus, when the "sync word correlation" method is applied to an<br>
oversampled signal, there may be multiple timmg alignments where the sync word is<br>
detected within the received signal. This is especially so given that hard decisions<br>
have already been made on the individual oversamples, prior to the timing recovery.<br>
[0008]	For minimum probability of error, it is desired to choose the timing<br>
alignment that corresponds to the "center" of the information symbol, because this is the maximum eye opening in an eye diagram that is used to depict ISI (inter-symbol interference). Choosing a timing alignment that is not the center of the symbol may result in a higher probability of error, since in general such an alignment is closer to the edge of the symbol, and is more susceptible to noise than the alignment at the center of the symbol. However, the process of identifying which alignment out of the multiple possible timing alignments corresponds to the center alignment is not obvious. Hence, there is a need for a robust and simple way of determining the center timing alignment<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention encompasses a process for recovering symbols<br>
from a binary data stream that is received at a predetermined data rate. The binary data stream is oversampled at a predetermined oversample rate to generate an oversampled signal. In one embodiment, the data rate is 1 MHz and the oversampling rate is 12 MHz, The incoming received oversampled signal is correlated with a predefined sequence known to both receiver and transmitter, called the "sync word." The output of the correlation is then convolved with a linear filter such as a moving average window of variable width. The output of the convolution is the convolution signal that is then scanned for a peak. The alignment corresponding to the peak is identified as the "center" of each symbol in the received signal<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION'OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018]	The invention provides a process for time-aligning a receiver with a<br>
received signal in order to determine a starting point for sampling the signal This reduces the probability of error in the recovered signal, thereby increasing the performance of the receiver.<br>
{00191	FIG. I illustrates the process in accordance with the invention that is<br>
used to detect a synchronizing word and to time-align a receiver with an incoming data<br>
stream. The process begins with oversampling the received signal (step 101). In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the input signal is a 1 Mbps, hard-decision binary stream.<br>
[0020]	Hard-decision refers to the fact that the "1" or "0" polarity of the<br>
. symbols in the incoming stream has aheady been decided in the previous step (the RF receiver). In a soft-decision binary stream the previous step supplies a multi-level quantized symbol and tlie decision as to the "1" or "0" polarity of the symbol is only made subsequently.<br>
[0021]	In an exemplary embodiment, the oversampling is performed at a 12<br>
MHz rate. In other words, tlie sampling rate is 12 times the input data rate. Alternate embodiments may use other sampling rates. The oversampling rate that is chosen is a trade-off between choosing a rate that is high enougli to accurately capture the data but not too high so as to generate too much information that requires a large amount of processing time.<br>
[0022]	Referring again to FIG. 1, the process next detects the synchronizing<br>
(sync) word (step 103) by a correlation process.  In one embodiment, the sync word<br><br>
is the 72-bit access code that precedes a data packet that is specified by the Bluetooth<br>
standard. Other embodiments use additional synclironizing words or symbols.<br>
[0023]	In order to detect the sync word (step 103), the received signal is<br>
oversampled at the 12 MHz rate. Using a match-filter correlation approach, the<br>
oversampled signal goes through the correlation process to generate a correlation<br>
signal. In this process, the oversampled signal is compared to the known sync word<br>
sequence. When the sequence matches, the correlation signal is highest.<br>
[0024]	FIG. 2 illustrates the results of the match-filter correlation. The<br>
correlation plot of FIG. 2 shows a bit-time of 1 _s where the correlation of the<br>
received signal is 72 due to the matching of the incoming 72-bit access code with the<br>
filter. The values for both the bit-time and the correlation are illustrations of the<br>
preferred embodiment. Alternate embodiments have different values.<br>
(0025]	A   linear  filter   is  then  generated   (step   105).   In   the   preferred.<br>
embodiment, this linear filter is a moving average window. Alternate embodiments use other forms of linear filters.<br>
[0026]	An impulse response of the moving average window, illustrated in FIG.<br>
3, is then generated (step 106). The impulse response has an amplitude of one and a length of n where n = 12 (i.e., the number of samples in one bit-time). Alternate embodiments use other values for n in the range of 1 up to the oversample rate, which in the exemplary embodiment is twelve (12).<br>
[0027]	The impulse response of FIG. 3 is convolved with the oversampled<br>
signal of FIG. 2 to generate the convolution signal illustrated in FIG. 4 (step 110). By convolving with a moving average window, an attempt is made to obtain a single peak from the possible multi-peak output of the matched-filter correlation in FIG. 2. ("single" and "multi" here refer to number of oversamples). The term "peak" refers to a local maximum of the signal value.<br>
[0028]	The presence of only one peak of the signal in FIG. 4, as opposed to<br>
twelve peaks in the signal of FIG. 2, shows that the goal of attaining only one peak has been accomplished through convolution with a moving average window. The fact<br><br>
that the magnitude of the peak also exceeds some threshold T shows that the access code or sync word has been received correctly. The peak also shows that point in time from which the subsequent stream of data can be sampled. In one embodiment, this sampling occurs every 1 _s. Alternate embodiments with different data rates use different sampling rates.<br>
[0029]	In a noisy environment, even the convolution signal illustrated in<br>
FIG. 4 may have multiple peaks (i.e., local maxima). Therefore, it is important to determine the proper alignment between the oversampled stream and the sync word in order to start the time for subsequent sampling. This is accomplished by averaging the time alignments corresponding to the "global maxima" of the convolution over the entire searcher window.<br>
[0030]	Referring again to the process of FIG.  1, when the convolution,<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4, reaches a predeteraiined threshold (step   115), the searcher<br>
window begins. In the present description, the threshold is illustrated as T.<br>
|0031J	The choice of threshold used to determine the searcher window is a<br>
trade-off between minimizing the probability of false alarms while ensuring that the<br>
searcher window is wide enough to pick the global peak. Because the minimum<br>
distance between valid sync words (dmin) is specified in the Bluetooth standard as 14,<br>
the threshold is set at 64 - (dmin/2) = 57 to avoid false alarms, while allowing for bit<br>
errors in the received sync word. The choice of 57 assumes that there are a negligible<br>
number of possible sync words with off-center autocorrelation values greater than 57.<br>
(0032]	The threshold determination described above is only  one method<br>
possible for determining the threshold. Alternate embodiments use other thresholds as well as other methods for determining the threshold.<br>
[0033J	The searcher window ends w oversamples later. The choice for w is<br>
also a design parameter that is a trade-off between minimizing delay (smaller w) and ensuring a global peak (larger w). In the preferred embodiment, w is the time duration of two information symbols.<br><br>
[0034J	If the correlation has reached the threshold T, the searcher begins to<br>
scan during the window w for the correlation peak (step 120). The searcher is well known in the art and is not discussed further<br>
[0035]	If more than one peak was found (step  125) during the correlation<br>
process, an averaging operation is performed to determine the time alignment Referring again to FIG. 4, testimate (also referred to as t*) is determined in a multiple peak environment by the following:<br>
estimate<br>
[0036]	In this equation, tfirsmiax is the first maximum peak scanned after the<br>
tlireshold is reached and tiastmax is the last maximum peak that was scanned after the tlireshold is reached. By dividing the floor function of the sum of these two peaks, the average peak is generated-<br>
[00371	If more than one peak was not found (step 125), the one peak itself is<br>
directly used as the time alignment peak. In this case, t* = tpeak (step 126). Once the estimate for the peak time is generated, either through the average of the floor fimction (step 130) or the single peak (step 126), t* is set as the time for alignent purposes (step 135).<br>
[0038]	As   discussed   above,   all   subsequent   sampling   is   perfomied   a<br>
predetermined time (i.e., every 1 _s in the preferred embodiment) after the estimated<br>
peak time, t*. Alternate embodiments use other sampling times.<br>
[0039)	Even though an estimate of the correct time alignment has been made,<br>
the actual decision of the polarity of the entire symbol (not just the oversamples, whose polarity the hard-decision process has already decided) must still be determined (step 140). One embodiment for making a bit decision on the symbol is to use the middle sample of the twelve oversamples. This would mean using either oversample number 6 or 7 if the oversampling rate is 12. This keeps the sampling and any subsequent sampling away from the transitions of the signal.<br><br>
[0040]	Another embodiment of a process for performing a bit decision (step<br>
140) is to take a majority vote over some subset m of the twelve oversamples. In this<br>
embodiment, m is odd and less than twelve. Alternate embodiments use other ranges<br>
for m since alternate embodiments use other oversampling rates than 12X. For<br>
example, if the oversampling rate was 20X, m might be less than twenty.<br>
[0041]	A desired value for m depends on the characteristics of the received<br>
signal. These characteristics include the RF processing that has been applied to it as<br>
well as the signal modulation at the transmitter. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
majority vote is performed with m = 3, Alternate embodiments use other values for m.<br>
[0042]	FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a signal for a sync word or access code.<br>
In one embodiment, this signal illustrates a portion of a 72-bit access word. This signal<br>
has a jitter in the first bit (505) that causes the first bit to overlap the second bit at<br>
times. Using the middle bit decision process would cause the first four bits of the<br>
access code to be chosen as 1110 when the second bit is actually a logical 0.<br>
[0043]	A (3 out of 12) majority vote process picks the middle sample of the<br>
twelve oversamples (as determined from the sync word correlation described earlier),<br>
and also looks at the oversample on either side of the middle oversample. Then a<br>
majority vote is performed on the three oversamples. As illustrated in FIG. 5, a<br>
majority of tlie oversamples from the second bit correctly indicate that that bit is a 0.<br>
10044]	FIG. 6 illustrates one embodiment in block diagrammatic form of a<br>
symbol recovery system in accordance with the present invention. More specifically, the illustrative embodiment incorporates a symbol recovery mechanism configured in accordance with Bluetooth compliant hardware.<br>
[0045]	The symbol recovery mechanism shown is comprised of a 2.4 GHz<br>
Bluetooth radio frequency block (605) that operates at 1 mW. The Bluetooth radio<br>
uses a Time-Division Duplex scheme with binary frequency modulation. The radio<br>
(60S) is coupled to an antenna (601) for transmitting and receiving the signals.<br>
[0046]	A baseband block (610) is responsible for the baseband protocols of<br>
the unit. This baseband block (610) incorporates the symbol recovery process of the<br><br>
previously disclosed embodiment. The RF block (605) recovers and sends  the<br>
baseband block (610) the oversampled, hard-decision, binary symbol stream for time<br>
alignment and recovery.<br>
[0047]	The Bluetooth  system   communicates  using packets of data.  An<br>
example of such a packet (700) is illustrated in FIG. 7. This packet is comprised of<br>
the access code or sync word (701), the header (705), and the payload (710).<br>
[0048]	The access code (701) is the sync word with which the symbol<br>
recovery process described herein synchronizes the receiver. In one embodiment, the<br>
access code (701) is 72 bits in length, the header (705) is 54 bits in length, and the<br>
payload of information (710) is in the range of zero to 2745 bits in length. Different<br>
packet types are defined by Bluetooth and, therefore, have different payload lengths,<br>
[0049]	The Bluetooth system can be incorporated in a mobile station such as a<br>
cellular telephone or other electronic device to enable short-range communication with<br>
the mobile station. For example, a headset incorporating the Bluetooth system can be<br>
coupled in a wireless fashion with the mobile.<br>
[0050]	FIG. 8 illustrates a block diagram of a mobile station  with the<br>
Bluetooth system incorporating the symbol recovery mechanism of the invention.<br>
This block diagram is only one such example of a mobile station.<br>
[0051]	The mobile station is comprised of an RF transmitter (802) and<br>
receiver (801) that are coupled to an antenna (803). The RF transmitter modulates the<br>
digital signals from the baseband circuitry (825) for transmission. The antenna (803)<br>
then radiates the signal over a channel to the intended destination.<br>
(0052]	The RF receiver (801) is responsible for receiving and demodulating<br>
signals received over the antenna (803). In some communication devices, the receiver<br>
may be responsible for converting received digital signals into their analog equivalent<br>
for radiation by a speaker or earpiece (806),<br>
[0053]	In a Bluetooth  or CDMA   environment,   The   signals   from   the<br>
microphone (805) undergo baseband packet processing by the baseband circuitry<br>
(825) to put them into the format illustrated in Fig. 7. Similarly, The signals from The<br><br>
RF receiver (801) undergo baseband circuitry (825) processing to return them to a state useable by the speaker or earpiece (806).<br>
[0054]	A processor (804) such as a microprocessor or other controlling device<br>
controls the mobile station. The processor (804) is coupled to and controls the RF transmitter (802) and RF receiver (801) functions.<br>
[0055]	A display (807) and keypad (808) are coupled to the processor (804),<br>
The display (807), such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), presents  information<br>
entered by a user on the keypad (808). For example, the user may enter a telephone<br>
number using the keypad (808) that is displayed  on the display   (807)  and<br>
subsequently transmitted to a base station using the RF transmitter (802).<br>
{0056]	The baseband circuitry (825) incorporating the symbol timbg recovery<br>
mechanism of the present invention receives the oversampled, binary, hard-decision symbol stream from the RF transmitter block (820) and converts the stream to a data signal that is used by the processor (804) for display or radiation by the speaker or earpiece (806). Similarly, the baseband circuitry (825) incorporating the symbol timing recovery mechanism of the present invention transmits a baseband signal to the RF transmitter (802) for processing.<br>
[0057]	While the symbol stream recovery process of the present invention is<br>
illustrated as being used in a cellular telephone, the disclosed embodiments can be used<br>
in any device having a received signal having good autocorrelation properties.   Such a<br>
device can be a personal digital assistant having wireless communication capabilities.<br>
[0058]	In summary, the symbol stream recovery process of the present<br>
invention provides a more accurate symbol recovery mechanism for hard decision binary stream of symbols. The present invention detects a sync word and provides time alignment using an n-out-of-12 correlation of a 12X oversampled input stream, where n represents the number of middle oversamples in each symbol of the reference sync word.<br>

steps can be interchanged without departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br>
