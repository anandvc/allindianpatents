Novel-heterocycles a£jnhit&gt;itors of leucocyte adhesion and as VLA-4 antagonists<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the formula I<br><br>
which are inhibitors of the adhesion and migration of leucocytes and/or antagonists of the adhesion receptor VLA-4 which belongs to the group of integrins. The invention also relates to processes for their preparation, to the use of compounds of the formula I for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases which are caused by an undesired extent of leucocyte adhesion and/or leucocyte migration or which are associated therewith or in ^hich cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions which are based on interactions of VLA-4 receptors with their ligands play a part, for example of inflammatory processes, of rheumatoid arthritis or of allergic disorders, and also to the use of compounds of t-ie formula I for the production of pharmaceuticals for use in such diseases, and to pharmaceutical preparations which contain the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The integrins are a group of adhesion receptors which play an important part in cell-cell-binding and cell-extra:,ellular matrix-binding processes. They have an ap-heterodimeric structure and exhibit a wide cellular distribution and a high extent of evolutive conservation. The integrins include, for example, the fibrinogen receptor on platelets, which interac s especially with the RGD sequence of fibrinogen, or the vitronectin receptor on os aoclasts, which interacts especially with the RGD<br><br>
sequence of vitronectin or iy osteopontin. The integrins are divided into three major groups, the [32 subfamily with the representatives LFA-1, Mac-1 and p150/95, which are responsible in particulc ' for cell-cell interactions of the immune system, and the subfamilies p1 and [33, whose representatives mainly mediate cell adhesion to components of the extrace ular matrix (Ruoslahti, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988, 57, 375). The integrins of the £" subfamily, also called VLA proteins (very late (activation) antigen), include at least six receptors which interact specifically with fibronectin, collagen and/or laminin as ligands. Within the VLA family, the integrin VLA-4 (a4[31) is atypical in so far as it is mainly restricted to lymphoid and myeloid cells and is responsible in ihese for cell-cell interactions with a large number of other cells. For example, Vi.A-4 mediates the interaction of T and B lymphocytes with the heparin ll-binding ,;'agment of human plasma fibronectin (FN). The binding of VLA-4 with the heparin I -binding fragment of plasma fibronectin is especially based on an interaction wtlh an LDVP sequence. In contrast to the fibrinogen or vitronectin receptor, VLA-^ is not a typical RGD-binding integrin (Kilger and Holzmann, J. Mol. Meth  1 .:)95, 73, 347).<br>
The leucocytes circulating in the blood normally exhibit only a low affinity for the vascular endothelial cells vvhich line the blood vessels. Cytokines which are released from inflamed tisd je cause the activation of endothelial cells and thus the expression of a large number of cell surface antigens. These include, for example, the adhesion molecules ELAM-1 (endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; also designated as E-selectin), which, inter alia, binds neutrophiles, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), whi;h interacts with LFA-1 (leucocyte function-associated antigen 1) on leucocytes, and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), which binds various leucocytes, inter alia lymphocytes (Osborn et al., Cell 1989, 59, 1203). VCAM-1 ( like ICAM-1, is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, VCAM-1 (first known as INCAM-"1' 0) was identified as an adhesion molecule which is induced on endothelial ce'ls by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 and lipopolysaccharides (LPS!. Elices et al. (Cell 1990, 60, 577) showed that VLA-4 and VCAM-1 form a receptor-licjand pair which mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes to activated endothelium Th \-. binding of VCAM-1 to VLA-4 does not take place here due to an interaction of tt&gt;: VLA-4 with an RGD sequence; such one is not<br><br>
contained in VCAM-1 (Beroslson et al., Current Biology 1995, 5, 615). VLA-4, however, also occurs on ot 'er leucocytes, and the adhesion of leucocytes other than lymphocytes is also mediated via the VCAM-1 A/LA-4 adhesion mechanism. VLA-4 thus represents an ir dividual example of a pi integrin receptor which, via the ligands VCAM-1 and fibromjctin, plays an important part in cell-cell interactions and in cell-extracellular matrix i ■ teractions<br>
The cytokinennduced adhesion molecules play an important part in the recruitment of leucocytes into extravasrular tissue regions. Leucocytes are recruited into inflammatory tissue region:; by cell adhesion molecules which are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and serve as ligands for leucocyte cell surface proteins or protein complexes (receptors) (the terms ligand and receptor can also be used vice versa). Leucocytes frcm the blood must first adhere to endothelial cells before ihey can migrate into the synovium. Since VCAM-1 binds to cells which carry the integrin VLA-4 (c
The VCAM-1A/LA-4 adhes:on mechanism has been connected with a number of physiological and patholoc.cal processes. Apart from cytokine-induced endothelium, VCAM-1 is additionally expressed, inter alia, by the following cells: myoblasts, lymphoid dendritic cells ard tissue macrophages, rheumatoid synovium, cytokine-stimulated neural cells, parietal epithelial cells of the Bowman's capsule, the renal tubular epithelium, inflamed tissue during heart and kidney transplant rejection and by intestinal tissue in graf:-versus-host disease. VCAM-1 is also found to be expressed on those tissue areas of the arterial endothelium which correspond to early arteriosclerotic plaques of a rabbit model. Additionally, VCAM-1 is expressed on follicular dendritic cell*; of human lymph nodes and is found on stroma cells of the bone marrow, for exanple in the mouse. The latter finding points to a function of VCAM-1 in B-cell development. Apart from cells of hematopoietic origin, VLA-4 is also found, for example, en melanoma cell lines, and the VCAM-1 A/LA-4 adhesion<br><br>
mechanism is connected w/.h the metastasis of such tumors (Rice et al., Science 1989( 246, 1303).<br>
The main form in which VCAM-1 occurs in vivo on endothelial cells and which is the dominant form in vivo is designated as VCAM-7D and carries seven immunoglobulin domains. The domains 4, £ and 6 are similar in their amino acid sequences to the domains 1, 2 and 3 The fourth domain is removed in a further form, consisting of six domains, designated here i\s VCAM-6D, by alternative splicing. VCAM-6D can also bind VLA-4-expressing eel 5<br>
Further details on VLA-4, VCAM-1, integrins and adhesion proteins are found, for example, in the articles by Kilger and Holzmann, J. Mol. Meth. 1995, 73, 347; Elices, Cell Adhesion in Human Disease, Wiley, Chichester 1995, p. 79; Kuijpers, Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 19^5, 16, 379.<br>
On account of the role of 1 -e VCAM-1A/LA-4 mechanism in cell adhesion processes which are of importance, fi:r example, in infections, inflammations or atherosclerosis, it has betifi attempted by means of interventions into these adhesion processes to control diseases, in particular, for example, inflammations (Osborn et al., Cell 1989, :9, 1203), A method of doing this is the use of monoclonal antibodies which are directed against VLA-4. Monoclonal antibodies (mAB) of this type which as VLA-4 antagonists block the interaction between VCAM-1 and VLA-4, are known. Thus, for examole, the anti-VLA-4 mAB HP2/1 and HP1/3 inhibit the adhesion of VLA-4-expressing Ramos cells (B-cell-like cells) to human umbilical cord endothelial cells and :o VCAM-1 -transfected COS cells.<br>
The anti-VCAM-1 mAB 4E9 likewise inhibits the adhesion of Ramos cells, Jurkat cells (T-cell-like cells) an<: hl60 cells to cos transfected with genetic c instructs which cause vcam-6d and vcam-7d be expressed. in vitro data w. antibodies are directed against the a4 subunit of vla-4 show that adhesion lymphocytes synovial endothe blocked an wh plays a part rheumatoid arthritis dinther-janssen et al. j. immunol></:><br>
In vivo experiments have si'own that an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis can be inhibited by anti-oc4 mAB. The migration of leucocytes into an inflammatory focus is likewise blocked by a monoclonal antibody against the aA chain of VLA-4. The influer t:ing of the VLA-4-dependent adhesion mechanism by antibodies was also investigated in an asthma model in order to investigate the role of VLA-4 in the recruitment of leucocytes in inflamed lung tissue (USSN 07/821,768; EP-A-626 861). The administration of anti-VLA-4 antibodies inhibited the late-phase reaction and respiratory tr;:.:t overreaction in allergic sheep.<br>
The VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion mechanism was also investigated in a primate model of inflammatory bovv 3l disease (IBD). In this model, which corresponds to ulcerative colitis in man, tho administration of anti-VLA-4 antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in the acute inflammation,<br>
Moreover, it was possible D show that VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion plays a part ]n the following clinical conditions including the following chronic inflammatory processes: rheumatoid art'htis (Cronstein and Weismann, Arthritis Rheum. 1993, 36, 147; Elices et al., J. C-n. Invest. 1994, 93, 405), diabetes mellitus (Yang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. US/\ 1993, 90, 10494), systemic lupus erythematosus (Takeuchi et al., J. Clin. In/est. 1993, 92, 3008), allergies of the delayed type (type IV allergy) (Elices et al.p Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1993, 11, p.77), multiple sclerosis (Yednock et al., Nature 1^92, 356, 63), malaria (Ockenhouse et al., J, Exo. Med, 1992, 176, 1183), arterio? Xerosis (Obrien et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1993, 92, 945), transplantation (Isobe et ri.( Transplantation Proceedings 1994, 26, 867-868), various malignancies, for ;xample melanoma (Renkonen et al., Am. J. Pathol. 1992, 140, 763), lymphoma (Fre-dman et al., Blood 1992, 79, 206) and others (Albelda et al.. J. Cell Biol. 1991, 114  1059).<br>
VLA-4 blocking by suitabl • antagonists accordingly offers effective therapeutic<br>
possibilities, in particular, :or example, of treating various inflammatory conditions including asthma and IBD. The particular relevance of VLA-4 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid cfthritis in this respect results, as already stated, from the fact that leucocytes from ihe blood must first adhere to endothelial cells before they<br><br>
can migrate into the synovi. mt and that the VLA-4 receptor plays a part in this adhesion. The fact that VC :.M-1 is induced by inflammatory agents on endothelial cells (Osborn, Cell 1990, 6;, 3; Stoolman, Cell 1989, 56, 907), and the recruitment of various leucocytes into c eas of infection and inflammatory foci has already been dealt with above. In this res :&gt;ect, T cells adhere to activated endothelium mainly via the LFA-1/ICAM-1 and VLA-4A/CAM-1 adhesion mechanisms (Springer, Cell 1994, 76, 301), On most synovia1 T cells, the binding capacity of VLA-4 for VCAM-1 is increased in rheumatoid a'lhritis (Postigo et al.( J. Clin. Invest. 1992T 89, 1445). Additionally, an increased fidhesion of synovial T cells to fibronectin has been observed (Laffon et al., J. ;;lin. Invest. 1991, 88, 546; Morales-Ducret et al., J. Immunol. 1992, 149, 1424 ■ VLA-4 is also upregulated both in the course of its expression and with respe: t to its function on T lymphocytes of the rheumatoid synovial membrane. The Mocking of the binding of VLA-4 to its physiological ligands VCAM-1 and fibronectin rr;ikes possible an effective prevention or alleviation of articular inflammatory processes. This is also confirmed by experiments with the antibody HP2/1 on Lewis rats with adjuvant arthritis, in which an effective prevention of illness has been observed (Barbadillo et al., Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1995, 16, 427), VLA-4 is t" us an important therapeutic target molecule.<br>
The abovementioned VLA-4 antibodies and the use of antibodies as VLA-4 antagonists are describee in the Patent Applications WO-A-93/13798, WO-A-93/15764, WO-A-94/1605M, WO-A-94/17828 and WO-A-95/19790. In the Patent Applications WO-A-94/1f.;i58, WO-A-95/15973, WO-A-96/00581, WO-A-96/06108 and WO-A-96/20216, pej: ide compounds are described as VLA-4 antagonists. The use of antibodies and peo ide compounds as pharmaceuticals, however, is afflicted with disadvantages; for example lack of oral availability, easy degradability or immunogenic action on leiger-term use, and there is thus a need for VLA-4 antagonists having a favo able profile of properties for use in therapy and prophylaxis<br>
W'O-A-95/14008 describes substituted 5-membered ring heterocycles which have an ammo, amidino or guanidino function at the N-terminal end of the molecule and which exhibit platelet aggregation-inhibiting activity. The German Patent Application<br><br>
19635522.2 describes heterocycles which are inhibitors of bone resorption, WO-A-96/33976 (and the German Patent Application 19515177.1) describes certain Jiydantoin derivatives having a 4-cyanophenyl radical in the 4-position of the hydantoin ring, which are intermediates for the preparation of active compounds which are described in WC-A-95/14008. Pharmacological actions of these cyanophenylhydantoin derivatives, however, are not disclosed.

The 6- to 24-membered bicyclic and tricyclic radicals R16 are formally obtained by abstraction of a hydrogen ;;itom from bicyclic systems or tricyclic systems. The bicyclic systems and tricyclic systems on which they are based can cdntain only carbon atoms as ring memi;ers, i. e, they can be bicycloalkanes or tricycloalkanes, but they can also contain one, two, three or four identical or different heteroatoms from the group consisting c-,: nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, i. e, they can be aza-, oxa-and thiabicyclo- and -tricycloalkanes. If heteroatoms are present, preferably one or two heteroatoms, in partici ar nitrogen or oxygen atoms, are present. The heteroatoms can assume z -ly desired positions in the bi- or tricyclic structure; they can be located in the bridges, or in the case of nitrogen atoms, also at the bridgeheads. Both the bicyclo- and tricycloalkanes and their heterocyclic analogs can be completely saturated or can contain one or more double bonds, Tney preferably contain one or t//o double bonds or, in particular, are completely saturated. Both the bicycle- and tricycloalkanes and the heterocyclic analogs and both the saturated and the unsaturated representatives can be unsubstituted or substituted in any desired suitable positions by one or more oxo groups and/or one or more identical or different (C1-C4)-alkyl groups, for example methyl or isopropyl groups, preferably methyl groups. The free bond of the bi- or tricyclic radical can be located in any desired position of the molecule; the radical can thus be bonded via a bridgehead atom or an atc:m in a bridge. The free bond can also be located in any desired stereochemical position, for example in an exo or an endo position.<br>

which can represent the gfoup R1, can be completely saturated in the ring or can contain one or more double bonds. In addition to the substituents in the groups Q1 and Q3, these heterocyclic rings can additionally carry one or more further, identical or different radicals R21 ar j/or halogen atoms as substituents. The meanings -C(R21)(-)- and -N(-)- contained in the definition of Q3 are to be understood as meaning that two of the ttrse free bonds of the carbon atom or of the nitrogen atom are directed toward the adjacent ring members and the third free bond is directed toward the group A, such I hat in this case the heterocyclic ring is thus bonded to the group A via the group Q3. If the heterocyclic ring is fused to the ring system in the group A via two adjacent c '.oms of the ring system, a condensed ring system is present. The fusion can take place via the group Q3 and the adjacent carbon atom or via any two desired adjacent carbon atoms. Examples of condensed ring systems of this type are the radicals-.<br><br><br>

Physiologically tolerable salts of the compounds of the formula 1 are, in particular, pharmaceutical^ utilizable or nontoxic salts.<br>
Such salts are formed, for example, from compounds of the formula I which contain acidic groups, for example :arboxylic acid or sulfonic acid or phosphonic acid groups, with inorganic bas^s, for example alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compounds or ammonia. 1 he salts of the compounds of the formula I can thus be, for example, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium or ammonium salts. Salts of compounds of the formula   with physiologically tolerable organic bases can also be formed, for example with physiologically tolerable organic amines such as triethylamine, ethanoiaminB or tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
Compounds of the formuk- I which contain basic groups, for example an amino group or a guanidino grouo, form salts with inorganic acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, and with organic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as, fc example, acetic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric; acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
Salts can be obtained fror, the compounds of the formula I by customary methods known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in &gt;* solvent or dispersant, or alternatively from other salts by anion exchange or cation exchange.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be present in stereoisomer^ forms. If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these can independently of one another have the S configuration or the R configuration. The invention includes all possible stereoisomers, for example enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of two or more stereoisomer^ forms, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in all ratios. The invention thus<br><br>
relates to enantiomers in e ';antiomerically pure form, both as Ievo- and as dextrorotatory antipodes, iri the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in ail ratios. If cis/trans isomerism is present, the invention relates to both the cis form and thii: trans form and mixtures of these forms.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention can moreover contain mobile hydrogen atoms, i.e  can be present in various tautomeric forms. The present invention also relates to al! these tautomers. The present invention furthermore includes all solvates of corvpounds of the formula I, for example hydrates or adducts with alcohols, as well as derivatives of the compounds of the formula I, for example esters, prodrugs and meta :olites which act like the compounds of the formula I.<br>

Generally, compounds of the formula I are preferred which have a uniform<br>

The compounds of the formula I can be prepared, for example, by fragment condensation of a compound of the formula II<br><br>
with a compound of the formula III,<br><br>
where W, Y, Z, B, D, E, R and b, d, e, f, g, and h are defined as indicated above and G is hydroxycarbonyl, (C1-C6)-alkoxycarbonyl, activated carboxylic acid derivatives, such as acid chlorides or active esters, or isocyanato.<br>
For the condensation of the compounds of the formula II with those of the formula III, the coupling methods of peptide chemistry known per se (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Org-mischen Chemie, [Methods of organic chemistry], Volume 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Th-sme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974) are advantageously used. To<br><br>
do this, as a rule it is necessary that nonreacting amino groups present are protected by reversible proactive groups during the condensation. The same applies to carboxyl groups not participating in the reaction, which are preferably present as (C1-C6)-alkyl, b-rizyl or tert-butyl esters. Amino group protection is unnecessary if the amino groups to be generated are still present as nitro or cyano groups and are formed, for gxample, by hydrogenation only after the coupling. After the coupling, the protective! groups present are removed in a suitable manner. For example, N02 groups (guanjdino protection), benzyloxycarbonyl groups and benzyl esters can be removed by 'lydro^enation.

Compounds of the formula I (in which W is R1-A-C(R13), Y is a carbonyl group and Z is NR° can be prepared, fo* example, by first reacting compounds of the formula IV<br><br>
in a Bucherer reaction to (jive compounds of the formula V,	<br><br>
in which just as in the formula IV R1, R13 and A are defined as indicated above (H. T. Bucherer, V. A. Lieb, J. Prakt. Chem. 141(1934), 5). Compounds of the formula V),<br><br>
in which R1, R13, A, B and G are defined as indicated above can then be obtained by fjr$t reacting the compounds of the formula V, for example, with an alkylating reagent which introduces tf e radical -B-G into the molecule. The reaction of compounds of the formula */l with a second reagent of the formula R°-LG, in which R° has the meanings indicated above and LG is a nucleophilically substitutable leaving group, for example* nalogen, in particular chlorine or bromine, (C^-C^)-alkoxy, optionally substituted phenoxy or a heterocyclic leaving group such as, for example, imjdazoiyl, leads :p the corresponding compounds of the formula II. These reactions can be carried out analogously to known methods familiar to the person skilled in the art. Depending on the individual case, it may be appropriate here, as in all steps in the synthesis cf the compounds of the formula I, temporarily to block functional groups which could lead to side reactions or undesired reactions by means of a protective groin strategy adapted to the synthesis problem, what is known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
If W is R1-A~CH=C, this stiuctural element can be introduced, for example, by<br>
* condensing an aldehyde with a 5-membered ring heterocycle which contains a<br>
methylene group in the position corresponding to the group W analogously to known methods.<br>
Compounds of the formula | in which the 5-membered ring heterocycle is a dioxo- or thioxo-oxo-substituted imitJazolidine ring in which W is R1-A-C(R13) can also be obtained as follows:<br>
by reaction of a-amino acids or N-substituted a-amino acids or preferably their esters, for example the methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl or benzyl esters, for example of a compound of the formula VII,<br><br><br><br>
^<br>
to the compounds of the fo*jiula |a can also be carried out by treatment with bases in inert solvents, for example by treatment with sodium hydride in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide<br>
During the cyclization, gua^idino groups can be blocked by protective groups, for example N02- Afrnino groups in the side chain can be present in protected form or still as an N02 or cyano function whicfi can later be reduced to the amino group or, in the case of the cyano group, also be converted into the formamidino group.<br>
Compounds of the formula i in which the 5-membered ring heterocycle is a dioxo- or thioxo-oxo-substituted imioazolidine ring in which W is R1-A-C(R13) and c is 1 can also be obtained by reacting a compound of the formula VII with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate of the formula X<br><br>
in which B, AJ and b are defined as indicated above for the formula VIII and L is an alkoxy group, for example a (C1-C4)-alkoxygroup such as methoxy, ethoxy or tert-butoxy, a (C6-C14)-aryloxy group, for example phenoxy, or a (C6-C14)-aryl-(CrC4)-alkoxy group, for example henzyloxy. In this case, a compound of the formula XI<br><br>
is obtained in which A, B, 7, L, R°, R1, R13 and b are defined as indicated above for the formulae IX and X, which is then cyclized under the influence of an acid or of a base, such as described &amp;oove for the cyclization of the compounds of the formula<br><br>
IX, to a compound of the fcrmula XII<br><br>
in which B, L, V, W, R° and b are defined as indicated above for the formulae la and X From the compound of tcte formula XII, a compound of the formula la is then obtained by hydrolysis of the group CO-l to give the carboxylic acid COOH and subsequent coupling with n compound of the formula III, as described above for the coupling of the compound!! of the formulae Hand III. Here too, during the cyclization functional groups can be present in protected form or in the form of precursors, for example guanidino groups; are blocked by N02 or amino groups are present in protected form or still as ar. N02 or cyano function which can later be reduced to the amino group or, in the cas* of the cyano group, also be converted into the formamidino group.<br>
A further method for the pioparation of compounds of the formula la is, for example, the reactionof compounds of the formula XIII,<br><br>
(XIII)<br>
in which W is R1-A-C(R13 and for which otherwise the definitions indicated above apply, with phosgene, thic: phosgene or corresponding equivalents (analogously to S. Goldschmidt and M. W ok, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 575 (1952), 217-231 and C. Tropp, Chem. Ber. 61 (15:8), 1431-1439).<br><br>

With respect to the preparation of the compounds of the formula I, the details on the synthesis of the molacula,' structure which are contained in the following documents are fully incorporated by r -ference: WO-A-95/14008, German Patent Application 19515177.1 and WO-A-9
For the preparation of cor'pounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S-R21, the starting materials used can be the corresponding compounds of the formula IV in which R1 is -S-R21. If compounds o: the formula IV in which R^ is a protected SH group are employed in the Bucherer reaction, compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -SH are obtained after the rerr oval of the protective group. These compounds can in turn<br><br>
be converted into compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S-R21 (with meanings of R21 other than hydroge-i) by introduction of the radical R21, or alternatively serve as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds of the formula I in which the atom bonded to the group A of the radical R*1 is a sulfur atom.<br>
Compounds of the formuls | in which R1 is -S(0)2-R21 can be prepared, for example, by oxidizing compounds o- the formula I in which R1 is -S-R21 to the sulfones according to methods kno^n from the literature (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [MeHods of Organic Chemistry], Vol. E12/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1985, p. 1058 ff.), i.e. to the compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S(0)2-R2i. Correspondingly, compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S-R21 can be oxidized to the sulfoxides under suitable reaction conditions familiar to the person skilled in the art according to methods known per se (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. E11/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1985, p. 702 ff.), i.e. to thi- compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S(0)-R21. If necessary, in the oxidations to the sulfoxides or to the sulfones, oxidation-sensitive groups in the molecule am protected by suitable protective groups before carrying out the oxidation.<br>
Compounds of the formuUi I in which R1 is -S(0)2-OR21 or -S(0)2-N(R21)-R28 can be prepared, for example, by oxidizing compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -SH according to methods known from the literature (cf.

The compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S(0)2-OR21 or -S(0)2-N(R21)-R28 can then be obtained from these sulfonic acids directly or via corresponding sulfonyl halides by esterification or linkage of an amide bond.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S(0)-OR21 or -S(0)-N(R21)-R28 can be prepared, for example, by converting compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -SH into the corresponding si *ides, i.e. into the salts in which R1 is -S* and the counterion is, for example, an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion, and then oxidizing these salts for example using meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, to the<br><br>
sulfinic acids, i.e. to the co ipdunds of the formula I in which R1 is -S(0)-OH (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden c jr Organischen Chemie, Vol. E11/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1985, p. fc |8 ff.). The corresponding sulfinic acid esters and sulfinamides, i.e. the compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S(0)-OR21 or -S(0)-N(R21)-R28, can be p'eparecj from the sulfinic acids by methods5 known per se.<br>
If necessary, also in the preparation of sulfonic acid derivatives and sulfinic acid derivatives by oxidation, oxidation-sensitive groups in the molecule are protected by suitable protective groups :efore carrying out the oxidation.<br>
Apart from the methods rrhntioned, for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I in which R1 is -S!0)-R22 -S(0)rR22, -S(0)-OR21, -S(0)2-OR21, -S(O)-N(R21)-R28 or -S(0)2-N(R2' )-R28 other processes described in the literature for preparing such types of compounds can generally also be used (cf.

The compounds of the formula lb according to the above definition have t' ) ability to inhibit the adhesion receptor VLA-4 and to inhibit ceil-cell and cell-matrix interaction processes in which interactions between VLA-4 and its ligands play a part. The activity of the compounds of the formula lb can be demonstrated, for example, in an assay in wnich the binding of cells which contain the VLA-4 receptor, for example leucocytes.. I; ligands of this receptor is measured, for example to VCAM-1, which for this purpose can advantageously also be prepared by genetic engineering. Details of such an assay are described below. In particular, the<br><br>
compounds of the formula o are able to inhibit the adhesion and the migration of leucocytes, for example thn adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells which - as explained above - is controlled via the VCAM-1/VLA-4 adhesion mechanism.<br>
The compounds of the formula lb and their physiologically tolerable salts are therefore suitable for the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases which are based on the interaction between the; VLA-4 receptor and its ligands or can be influenced by inhibition of this interaction and in particular they are suitable for the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases wh ch are caused at least partially by an undesired extent of leucocyte adhesion and/or eucocyte migration or which are associated therewith, and for whose prevention, .alleviation or cure the adhesion and/or migration of leucocytes should be reduced. They can thus be employed, for example, as antiinflammatory agents in the case of inflammatory symptoms having very different causes. The compounds of the formula lb according to the present invention are used, for example, for the reatment or prophylaxis of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis), systemic lupus erythematosus or for the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system, such as, for example, multiple sclerosis, for the treatment or prophylaxis of asthma or of allergies, for example allergies of the delayed type (type IV allergy), furthermore for the treatment or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, arteriosclerosis, restenosis, for the treatment or prophylaxis of diabetes, for the prevention of damage to organ transplants, for the inhibition of tumor growth or tumor metastasis in varioi.j malignancies, for the therapy of malaria, and also of other diseases in which blocking of the integrin VLA-4 and/or influencing of the leucocyte activity appears appropriate for prevention, alleviation or cure. The compounds of the formula lb and their salts can furthermore be employed for diagnostic purposes, e. g, in in vitro diagnoses, and as tools in biochemical investigations in which VLA-4 blocking or influencing of cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions is intended.<br>
The compounds of the foimula lb and their physiologically tolerable salts can be administered according t:&gt; the invention, as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis, to animals, \:. eferably to mammals, and in particular to man. They can<br><br>
be administered per se, in nixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit enteral or parenteral use and which as active constituents contair. an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the formula lb and/or its physi ;J ogically tolerable salts in addition to customary, pharmaceutical^ innocuous excipients and/or additives. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain approximately 0.5 to 90% by weight of the therapeutically active compounds of the formula lb and/or their physiologically tolerable salts.<br>
The present invention relays to the compounds of the formula lb and/or their physiologically tolerable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, the use of the compounds of the formula lb and/or tht-ir physiologically tolerable salts for the production of pharmaceuticals for the inhibition of the adhesion and/or migration of leucocytes or for the inhibition of the VLA-4 receptor, i.e. of pharmaceuticals for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases in which leucocyte adhesion and/or leucocyte migration has an undesired extent, or of diseases in which VLA-4-dependent adhesion processes play a part, in particular for the production of pharmaceuticals for the inhibition of inflammation, and also tht- use of the compounds of the formula lb and/or their physiologically tolerable s alts in the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases of this type. The present invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical preparations which contain an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the formula lb and/or its physiologically tolerab i. salts in addition to customary pharmaceutical^ innocuous excipients andior additives.<br>
The pharmaceuticals can he administered orally, for example in the form o» pills, tablets, film-coated tablets sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, syrup;, emulsions or suspensions. However, administration can also take place rectally, fcr example in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, for example in the form of injection or infusion solutions, microcapsules or rods, or percutaneously, for examile in the form of ointments or tinctures, or by other routes, for example in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations to be employed according to the invention are<br><br>
prepared in a manner known per se, pharmaceutically inert inorganic and/or organic excipients being used in addition to the compound(s) of the formula lb ana/or its/their physiologically tolerable salts. For the production of pills, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules, it is possible to use, for example, lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Excipients for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable excipients for the preparation of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable excipients for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.<br>
In addition to the active compounds and excipients the pharmaceutical preparations can additionally contain additives, such as, for example, fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wettin;i agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preserv3tives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings or aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, and also solvents or solubilizers or agents for achieving a depot effect, as well as salts for changing the osmotic pressure, coatings or antioxidants. They can also contain two or mere compounds of the formula lb and/or their physiologically tolerable suits. In addition to at least one compound of the formula lb and/or its physiologically tolerable salts, they can further contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active substances, for example substances having antiinflammatory action.<br>
The dose can vary within ^/ide limits and is to be adapted to the individual conditions in each individual case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, in particular 0.3 to 2 mg/kg rf body weight is adequate to achieve effective results. In the case of intravenous administration, the daily dose is in general approximately 0.01 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of body weight. The daily dose can be subdivided, in particular, ■• the case of administration of relatively large amounts, into a number of, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. Where appropriate, it may be necessary, depending on individual behavior, to deviate upwards or<br><br>
downwards from the indicatad daily dose. Pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.2 to 500 rng, preforably 1 to 100 mg, of active compound of the formula lb and/or its physiologically tc erable salts per dose<br>
Examples<br>
The products were identified by means of mass spectra (MS) and/or NMR spectra. Compounds which were p.rified by chromatography using an eluent which contained, for example, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid and were then freeze-dried partly still contained, depending on the freeze-drying procedure, the acid contained in the eluent, and were thus partially or completely obtained in the form of a salt, for example in the form of the acetic acid salt or trifluoroacetic acid salt.<br>

Investigation of the biological activity<br>
As a test method for the activity of the compounds of the formula lb on the interaction between VCAM-1 and VLA-4, an assay is used which is specific for this interaction. The cellular binding components, i.e. the VLA-4-integrins, are offered in their natural form as surface molecules on human U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593), which belong to the group :»f leucocytes. As specific binding components, recombinant soluble fusior proteins prepared by genetic engineering and consisting of the extracytoplasmic domains of human VCAM-1 and the constant region of a human immunoglobulin of ne subclass lgG1 are used.<br>
Test method<br>
Assay for the measuremen: of the adhesion of U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593) to hVCAM-1(1-3)-lgG<br>
1.   Preparation of human VCAM-1 (1-3)-lgG and human CD4-lgG<br>
A genetic construct for the expression of the extracellular domains of human VCAM-1 was employed, associated with the genetic sequence of the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin Ig3-1 (hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions), from Dr. Brian Seed, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA. The soluble fusion protein hVCAM-1(1-3)-lgG contained the three amino-terminal extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of human VCAM-1 (Damle and Aruffo, Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci, USA 1991, 88, 6403). CD4-lgG (Zettlmeissl et al., DNA and Cell Biology 1990, 9, 347) served as a fusion protein for negativf controls. The recombinant proteins were expressed as soluble proteins after DEAE/dextran-mediated DNA-transfection in COS cells (ATCC CRL1651) according to standard procedures (Ausubel et al., Current protocols in molecular biology, John Vv'iley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994).<br><br>
2.     Assay for measurement of the adhesion of U937 cells to hVCAIvM (1 -3)-lgG<br>
2.1	96-well microtiter test plates (Nunc Maxisorb) were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with 100 ul/well of a goat-anti-human IgG antibody solution (10 pg/ml in 50 mM Tris, pH 9.5). After removing the antibody solution, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.2	150 ul/well of a blocking buffer (1 % BSA in PBS) was incubated on the plates at room temperature for 0.5 hours. After removing the blocking buffer, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.3	100 pi per well of a cell culture supernatant of transfected COS cells were incubated on the plates at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The COS cells were transfected with a plasmid which codes for the three N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains of VCAM-1, coupled to the Fc part of human lgG1 (hVCAM-1(1-3)-lgG). The content of hVCAM-1 (1 -3)-lgG was about 0.5-1 ug/ml. After removing the culture supernatant, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.4	The plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes with 100 ul/well of Fc receptor blocking buffer (1 mg/ml of v-globulin, 100 mM NaCI, 100 uM MgCI2, 100 uM MnCI2, 100 uM CaCI2, 1 mg/ml BSA in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). After removing the Fc receptor blocking buffer, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.5	20 pi of binding buffer (100 mM NaCI, 100 uM MgCI2,100 uM MnCI2, 100 pM CaCI2, 1 mg/ml BSA in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5), were initially introduced, the substances to be tested w« re added in 10 ul of binding buffer and the mixture was incubated for 20 minutes. As controls, antibodies against VCAM-1 (BBT, No. BBA6) and against VLA-4 (Immu-iotech, No. 0764) were used.<br>
2.6	U937 cells were incubated in Fc receptor blocking buffer for 20 minutes and then pipetted in at a concmtration of 1 x 106/ml and in an amount of 100 pi per well (final volume 125 pl/well).<br><br>
2.7	The plates were slow!/ immersed at an angle of 45° in stop buffer (100 mM NaCI, 100 pM MgCI2, 100 gM MnCI2, 100 pM CaCI2 in 25 mM Trisf pH 7.5) and shaken off. The process wis repeated.<br>
2.8	50 pi/well of a dye solution (167 pg/mi of Hoechst dye 33258, 4% formaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) were then incubated on the plates for 15 minutes,<br>
2.9	The plates were shaken off and slowly immersed at an angle of 45° in stop<br>
buffer (100 mM NaClt 100 |JM MgCI2, 100 pM MnCI2, 100 pM CaCI2 in 25 mM tris,<br>
pH 7.5). The process was repeated. Then, with the liquid, measurements were made<br>
in a cytofluorimeter (Millipore) (sensitivity: 5; filter: excitation wavelength: 360 nm,<br>
emission wavelength: 460 nm).<br>
The intensity of the light emitted by the stained U937 cells is a measure of the number of the U937 cells adhered to the hVCAM-1(1-3)-lgG and remaining on the plate and thus a measure tf the ability of the added test substance to inhibit this adhesion. From the inhibit on of the adhesion at various concentrations of the test substance, the concentrat on IC50 which leads to an inhibition of adhesion by 50% was calculated.<br>
