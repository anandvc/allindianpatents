NOVEL LACCASE ENZYMES AND THEIR USES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel laccase enzymes useful in many applications. This invention relates also to nucleic acids encoding the enzymes, vectors, host cells and methods for producing the enzymes as well as enzyme preparations comprising the enzymes. Furthermore, this invention relates to methods for treating denim, methods for stain removal, methods for treating natural or man-made fibre or lignocellulosic fibre, methods for treating wool, methods for treating hair and methods for bleaching pulp and dye house effluents and methods for decolorizing dyes. This invention relates also to various uses and compositions, which can be used in the mentioned applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Laccases (EC. 1.10.3.2 p-benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase) belong to a family of multi-copper oxidases. Laccases are widely distributed enzymes in higher plants, fungi, some insects and bacteria. They are characterized by low substrate specificity, oxidizing various substrate, including diphenols, polyphenols, different substituted phenols, diamines, aromatic amines, and even inorganic compounds like iodine. Laccases oxidize their substrates by a one-electron oxidation mechanism, and they use molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor. Among laccases the primary sequence, induction mechanism, physico-chemical (e.g. isoelectric point and carbohydrate content) and biochemical characteristics are variable. The copper binding sites of laccases are, however, strictly conserved.<br>
Several laccase proteins and genes encoding these laccases have been previously isolated. For example WO 01/92498 describes a fungal laccase enzyme isolated from Melanocarpus albomyces strain, the patent publication EP 0765394 Bl (corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,981,243) describes the cloning of a laccase gene from Myceliophthora thermophila and its expression in Aspergillus and U.S. Patent No. 5,750,388 describes the cloning of a laccase gene from Scytalidium thermophilum and its expression in Aspergillus.<br>
Chefetz et al. (1998a) describe isolation and preliminary characterization of a laccase from composted municipal soil waste. The microbe producing this laccase was later identified as Chaetomium thermophilum, and the enzyme was further purified and characterized (Chefetz et al., 1998b). The reported enzyme had pl 5.1. The laccase was stable for 1 h at 70°C and had half-lives of 24 and 12 h at<br><br>
2 40 and 50°C, respectively. The enzyme was stable at pH 5 to 10 and the pH optimum was 6. Saito et al.<br>
(2003) describe purification and characterization of an extracellular laccase of a fungus from family Chaetomiaceae. The molecular mass of the enzyme was approximately 73 to 80 kDa and pl of 3.5. The optimum pH for the oxidation of syringaldazine was 7.0 and the optimum temperature was 42°C. The laccase was stable for up to 288 h at 4°C and its respective half-life times at 25 and 40°C were estimated to be 150 and 20 h.<br>
Laccases have many industrially potential applications, such as delignification of wood pulps, methods for treating lignin containing fibers, methods for treating wood fibers in order to functionalize them or glue the fibers, improval of the production of fuel ethanol from renewable raw materials, food applications (for example in baking or clarification of beer or wine), various bioremediative processes and textile applications, such as denim treatment, stain removal, treatment of various fibers for textile industry, methods for decolorizing dyes and methods for treating dye house effluents, or use in hair dyeing composition, in hard-surface cleaning or in detergent formulations.<br>
"Stone washed" look or an abraded look has been denim producers' interest in recent years. Traditional stone washing with pumice stones reduces the strength of fabric and burdens the laundering apparatuses. Past years the trend has been towards enzymatic denim finishing processes. "Bleached look" of denim is normally obtained by means of bleaching chemicals, e.g. sodium hypochlorite. So far bleaching with hypochlorite has been the most efficient bleaching method for denim dyed with Indigo, since almost all shades can be obtained. However, hypochlorite process is environmentally very harmful, it is difficult to control and it damages the fabric easily. It is also very inconvenient or even harmful method for the user, it cannot be used for Lycra containing products and antichlor treatment with several rinsing/washing steps is required. There is thus a need for development of ecologically less harmful alternative for sodium h\^pochlorite, in particular laccases have been studied for that purpose.<br>
WO 97/25468 describes the use of laccase in a method for providing to dyed denim an abraded look. The method comprises a cellulase treatment and simultaneous or subsequent treatment with a phenol oxidizing enzyme, such as laccase, and an enhancing agent, such as methylsyringate. Myceliophthora thermophila laccase is the example of laccases in the patent publication.<br>
hi textile industry new materials, finishes and dyes have been developed in recent years. Although the new developments have many advantageous properties, such as easy drying, stain and water resistance, or bright colours of the textiles, their disadvantage quite often is that they must be washed at low temperatures. Low temperatures are preferred also for economical reasons, since the use of low temperatures saves energy. There is thus a need for laccases which function at low temperatures.<br><br>
3<br>
Even though numerous publications describing laccases from various microorganisms are available, there is still a need for novel laccases, which would function more effectively and be more suitable for the various conditions in different applications.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to eliminate at least some of the problems associated with the prior art. In particular, it is an aim of this invention to provide novel laccase enzymes having varying properties suitable for different applications.<br>
This invention is based on the surprising finding that laccase enzymes having novel and diverse properties can be isolated from the same genus, species and even from the same strain. Some of the laccases are in particular suitable for use at relatively low temperatures.<br>
One object of this invention is a laccase enzyme, which comprises the amino acid sequence SEQ ID 41 (TaLcc2) or a sequence showing at least 60 % identity to the sequence SEQ ID NO: 41.<br>
More specifically the laccase enzyme of this invention is characterized by what is stated in the characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The enzyme is preferably obtainable from a microorganism, more preferably from a filamentous fungus, in particular from the genus Thielavia, more specifically from the species Thielavia arenaria. Advantageously, the enzyme is obtainable from the strain CBS 116071 deposited on 2 September 2004 at Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Upsalalaan 8, 3584 CT, Utrecht, the Netherlands.<br>
The enzyme functions at broad pH range from pH 3 to 9, preferably at pH 4 to 8, most preferably at pH 4.5 to 6.5. The enzyme functions also at broad temperature range. For example, in denim treatment the enzyme is effective at 30 to 80 "C, preferably at temperatures 40 to 60°C. The enzyme is most active at temperatures 40 to 50°C and is thus very useful in applications, where lower temperatures are more advantageous.<br>
In particular, in denim treatment laccases that can be used at low temperatures have advantages over laccases which function better in conventional temperatures, such as about 60'C. Lower temperatures save energy and are more economical.<br><br>

By using the description provided herein, a person, skilled in the art can find and isolate laccases of the present invention from other genera of fungi, from other microorganisms and also from higher organisms, such as plants.<br>
Laccase of the present invention can be isolated from any organism producing laccase. Preferably the laccase enzyme of the present invention is isolated from a microbial source. Organisms capable of producing laccase can be screened, the activity on various substrates can be determined, and the enzyme characterized. For example, the pH and temperature ranges, where the enzyme functions, pH and temperature optima, and enzyme stability in various temperatures, can be determined. Alternatively, genes encoding laccases in various organisms can be isolated and the amino acid sequences encoded by the genes can be compared with the amino acid sequence of the laccases isolated and characterized in the Examples here. This includes direct cloning from environmental samples.<br>
Microorganisms that produce the laccase of the present invention can be isolated from nature or they can be screened from already isolated and identified strains of culture collections by using screening methods that are well known to a person skilled in the art. Screening can be carried out by studying the production of the enzyme either on a solid culture on plate cultivations or in a liquid culture medium by measuring the enzyme activity. Suitable substrates for measuring the activity include ABTS, di-methoxyphenol (DMP), guaiacol, and syringaldazine. Fungi can be screened for their ability to produce<br><br>
13 laccases for example by the methods referred in Example 1 with indicators, such as Remazol Brilliant<br>
Blue R-478 and guaiacol or ABTS. Suitable laccases can be isolated and the genes encoding them can be cloned also from higher organisms, such as plants.<br>
Microorganism strains, which are found as a result of screening can be cultivated on a suitable medium, and the formation of laccase in the culture solution or plate can be observed. After a sufficient amount of laccase of interest has been produced, the enzyme can be purified and its properties can be more thoroughly characterized.<br>
The produced laccase enzymes can be isolated and purified by using conventional methods of protein chemistry, such as salt precipitation, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purification can be monitored by protein determination, enzyme activity assays and by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme activity of the purified enzyme at various temperatures and pH values can be determined; similarly, the molecular weight and the isoelectric point can be determined.<br>
The purified enzyme refers to an enzyme preparation, which has no other proteins or very low amount of other proteins in addition to the laccase protein. The purity of the obtained laccase that is essentially free from other proteins is &gt;90%.<br>
The purification of the preferred laccases of the present invention has been exemplified in Example 1. Concentrated Thielavia culture filtrate was loaded on Q Sepharose FF column, proteins were eluted with an increasing salt gradient and laccase active fractions were loaded on Sephacryl S100 gel filtration resin. Purification was followed by activity assays and by SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In order to obtain high purity samples an additional Resource Q anion exchange step was included. The culture supernanatant of Chaetomium laccase was concentrated and buffer changed to binding buffer by ultrafiltration. Proteins were bound to DEAE Sepharose FF, eluted with a sodium sulphate gradient and laccase positive fractions were pooled and further purified with hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Finally the purity of active fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining. Naturally, it is possible to separate the enzymes of the present invention by using other known purification methods instead, or in addition to the methods described here.<br>
Molecular weight of the laccase can be determined on SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (1970) and the isoelectric point of the laccase can be determined with isoelectric focusing and bands containing laccase activity can be visualized by staining the gel with ABTS, for example, as described in Example 2.<br><br>
14<br>
Determination of laccase activity at various temperatures can be carried out by using ABTS as a substrate, as described in Example 1 in accordance with the method developed by Niku-Paavola et al. (1988) or by other methods described in literature.<br>
The pH optimum of the laccase can be determined on a suitable substrate in a suitable buffer at different pH values by measuring activity.<br>
The thermal stability can be determined by incubating an enzyme sample for different time periods at various temperatures in a suitable buffer at a certain pH. The residual activity of the enzyme at each temperature can be defined pH values by measuring activity.<br>
Specific activities of the purified laccase can be determined towards different laccase substrates, such as ABTS, di-metoxy-phenol (DMP), syringaldazine, and guaiacol.<br>
The effect of various inhibitors on laccase activity can be determined by measuring the oxygen consumption during the enzyme reaction with ABTS, for example, in sealed and fully filled containers with oxygen electrode or following the enzyme activity by spectroscopic means in the presence of an inhibitor.<br>
The N-terminus of the protein as well as the internal peptides can be sequenced according to Edman degradation chemistry [Edman and Begg (1967)] as described in Example 2 or by other methods described in the literature.<br>
The molecular weight of the purified major laccase enzymes isolated from Thielavia arenaria and Chaetomium thermophilum culture supernatants were both approximately 80 kDa. The purified Thielavia laccase showed multiple bands in isoelectric focusing at pis 5.5, 5.9, 6.4, 6.8, and 6.9. The purified Chaetomium laccase showed 3-4 bands in isolelectric focusing at pis 4.1 to 4.3.<br>
The pH optimum for the purified Thielavia laccase was 5.5 determined on guaiacol, and the enzyme showed substantially high activity still at pH 7. The pH optimum for the purified Chaetomium laccase was al pH 5.0. The accurary of the measurement is ± 0.5.<br>
The specific activity of the Thielavia laccase enzyme was the highest on ABTS, 1020 nkat/mg of protein at pH 4.5. The specific acitivity on DMS was 260, on syringaldazin 490 and on guaiacol 63 nkat/mg at pH 5.5. The specific activity of the Chaetomium laccase enzyme was the highest on ABTS, 750 nkat/mg of protein at pH 4.5. The specific activity on DMP was 290, on syringaldazin 400 and on guaiacol 85 nkat/mg atpH 5.5.<br><br>
15 The laccase which shows advantageous properties may be either produced by the original or recombinant<br>
host by a method comprising cultivating under suitable conditions a host into which a DNA sequence encoding said laccase and sequences needed for expressing said enzyme, have been introduced, and optionally isolating the enzyme. The production host can be any organism capable of expressing the laccase. Preferably the host is a microbial cell, more preferably a fungus. Most preferably the host is a filamentous fungus. Preferably the recombinant host is modified to express and secrete laccase as its main activity or one of its main activities. The spent culture medium of the production host can be used as such, or it may be concentrated, filtrated or fractionated. It may also be dried.<br>
Suitable expression and production host systems are for example the production system developed for the fungus host Trichoderma (EP 244 234), or Aspergillus production system, such as A. oryzae or A. niger (WO 9708325 and WO 9533386, US 5,843,745, US 5,770,418), or the production system developed for fungal species of Fusarium, such as F. oxysporum (Malardier et al., 1989). Suitable production systems developed for bacteria are a production system developed for Bacillus, for example B. subtilis or for E. coli, or for actinomycete Streptomyces. Suitable production systems developed for yeasts are systems developed for Saccharomyces, Shizosaccharomyces or Pichia pastoris. Production systems in some other microbes or in mammalian cell can also be used.<br>
Preferred hosts for producing laccase enzyme of the present invention are in particular strains from genus Trichoderma or Aspergillus.<br>
Within the scope of protection of the present invention are also vectors which can be used when the nucleic acid sequence encoding the chosen laccase are introduced into a host. Within the scope of protection are also sequences facilitating the expression and secretion of the laccase encoding sequence, such as promoters and signal sequences.<br>
Standard molecular biology methods can be used in the cloning of the laccase enzyme i.e. in the isolation and enzyme treatments of DNA, in E. coli transformations, etc. The basic methods used are described in the standard molecular biology handbooks, e.g. Sambrook et al. (1989) and Sambrook and Russell (2001).<br>
Genomic library prepared from the chosen host organism was screened with probes prepared by PCR. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR reactions based on the amino acid sequences of the peptides obtained from the purified laccase enzyme produced by the natural host and on the consensus sequences of fungal laccases. The DNA products obtained were characterized by sequencing and by performing Southern blot hybridizations to the genomic Thielavia and Chaetomium DNA digested with several restriction enzymes.<br><br>
16<br>
Four laccase genes were isolated from Thielavia and three from Chaetomium. All these genes were included into plasmid vectors and deposited in an E.coli strain to the DSMZ collection. The full-length Thielavia laccase gene Talccl was included in the plasmid pALK1342 and deposited under number DSM 15484. Accordingly, Thielavia laccase gene Talcc2 was included in the plasmid pALK1347 and deposited under number DSM 15486, Talcc3 gene was included in the plasmid pALK1345 and deposited under number DSM 15485 and Talcc4 gene was included in the plasmid pALK1664 under number DSM 15487. Chaetomium laccase gene Ctlccl was included in the plasmid pALK.1304 and deposited under number DSM 15075. Ctlcc2 was included in the plasmid pALK13O5 and deposited under number DSM 15076. Ct!cc3 was included in the plasmid pALK1685 and deposited under number DSM 16040. The deduced amino acid sequences of the laccases were analyzed from the DNA sequence.<br>
The sequences of the laccase genes and deduced laccase proteins are shown Figure 6. The relevant information on the genes and the deduced amino acid sequences are summarized in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.<br>
For example, the length of the Talcc2 gene was 1957 bp (or 1737 bp depending on the translation start site) including the stop codon and the gene had two introns. The deduced protein sequence consisted of 589 amino acids (for the shorter deduced amino acid sequence 579 amino acids) including a predicted signal sequence of 29/24 amino acids and no "tail" after the consensus sequence DSGI. The predicted molecular mass was 61811/62274 Da for the mature polypeptide and the predicted pi was 4.65/4.65 (signal sequence removed). The deduced amino acid sequence included 12 putative N-glycosylation sites.<br>
The length of the Ctlccl gene was 2127 bp (including the stop codon) and the gene had five introns. The deduced protein sequence consisted of 607 amino acids including a predicted signal sequence of 20 amino acids and a "tail" of 13 amino acids after the consensus sequence DSGL. The predicted molecular mass was 63905Da for the mature polypeptide (signal sequence and tail not included) and the predicted pi was 6.09 (signal sequence removed). The deduced amino acid sequence included 9 putative N-glycosylation sites.<br>
The deduced amino acid sequences of TaLccl and CtLccl were found to be the most homologous to each other, as were also the TaLcc3 and CtLcc2 (also at the gene level, e.g. in the organization of introns of the respective genes). The identity value obtained for TaLccl and CtLccl using Needleman-Wunsch global alignment (EMBLOSUM62, Gap penalty 10.0, Extend penalty 0.5; European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite program package, version 2.9.0; Rice et al., 2000) was 69.5% and that for TaLcc3 and CtLcc2 was 67.3% (Table 10). The identity values of the other laccase proteins were lower, when aligned with each other and with TaLccl, CtLccl, TaLcc3 and CtLcc2 as can be seen in Table 10.<br><br>
17 By the term "identity" is here meant the identity between two amino acid sequences compared to each<br>
other from the first amino acid encoded by the corresponding gene to the last amino acid. The identity of the full-length sequences is measured by using Needleman-Wunsch global alignment program at EMBOSS (European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite) program package, version 2.9.0, with the following parameters: EMBLOSUM62, Gap penalty 10.0, Extend penalty 0.5.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention are enzymes or polypeptides which comprise amino acid sequences which have laccase activity and which show at least 60 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:41 (TaLcc2). Preferred enzymes comprise amino acid sequences which show at least 65 %, more preferably at least 70 %, even more preferably at least 75 % identity. Still more preferable the amino acid sequences show at least 80%, more preferably at least 85 %, more and more preferably at least 90 %, most preferably at least 95 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:41.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention are also enzymes or polypeptides which comprise amino acid sequences which have laccase activity and which show at least 58 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:43 (TaLcc3). Preferred enzymes comprise amino acid sequences which show at least 65 %, more preferably at least 68 %, even more preferably at least 75 % identity. Still more preferably the amino acid sequences show at least 80 %, more preferably at least 85 %, more and more preferably at least 90 %, most preferably at least 95 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:43.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention are also enzymes or polypeptides which comprise amino acid sequences which have laccase activity and which show at least 78 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:45 (TaLcc4). Preferred enzymes comprise amino acid sequences which show at least 80 %, more preferably at least 85 %, even more preferably at least 90 % identity.

Preferred enzymes comprise amino acid sequences which show at least 76 %, more preferably at least 80 %, even more preferably at least 85 % identity. Still more preferable the amino acid sequences show at least 90 %, most preferably at least 95 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:47.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention are enzymes or polypeptides which comprise amino acid sequences which have laccase activity and which show at least 55 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:49 (CtLcc2). Preferred enzymes comprise amino acid sequences which show at least 60 %, more preferably at least 68 % identity. Still more preferable the amino acid sequences show at least 75%,<br><br>
18 more preferably at least 80 %, still more preferably at least 85 %, more and more preferably at least 90<br>
%, most preferably at least 95 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:49.<br>

Within the scope of the present invention are also enzymes and truncated polypeptides as defined above, but which lack signal sequence or tail or both. The signal sequence or the tail or both may be cut for example during posttranslational phases of the production or in the spent culture medium or during the storage of the culture medium or enzyme preparation. In addition, a propeptide from the protein may be cleaved by the host. The truncation can also be achieved e.g. by shortening the gene encoding the polypeptide prior to transforming it to the production host.<br>
The laccase according to the invention can be produced to the culture medium of its natural host or a recombinant host, from where it can be isolated and purified by using known methods of protein chemistry. If the culture medium contains a sufficiently high amount of laccase but no other detrimental proteins, it is possible to use the culture medium as such by simply separating the cells. When so desired, the culture solution can be concentrated, filtrated, fractionated and/or purified. It may also be dried. It is preferable to use, in various applications, an enzyme preparation containing an increased amount of laccase. Such an enzyme preparation can be prepared by producing the increased amount of laccase enzyme in the culture medium of the production host by means of gene technology or by optimising the culture conditions. The increased amount refers to an amount of laccase enzyme, which exceeds the amount of laccase enzyme naturally produced by the natural host. By "spent culture medium" is here meant the culture medium of the host comprising the produced enzymes.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention Thielavia and Chaetomium laccases can be produced in a filamentous fungus host, preferably in a Trichoderma host. The production is described in more detail in Example 4. The purification and characterization of recombinant laccases in terms of pH optimum, thermal stability, and pi is described in Example 5. Thielavia laccase TaLcc2 had pH optimum on guaiacol at pH 5.5, TaLcc3 at pH 5.0 on guaiacol, TaLcc4 at pH 6.0 on DMP. CtLcc 1 had pH optimum on guaiacol at pH 5.0.<br><br>
19<br>
TaLcc2 enzyme functions at a broad pH range from pH 3 to 9, preferably at pH 4 to 8, most preferably at pH 4.5 to 6.5 determined on guaiacol. TaLcc3 enzyme functions at pH 3.5 to 7.5, preferably at pH 4 to 6.5 determined on guaiacol. TaLcc4 enzyme functions at pH 3.5 to 7.5, more preferably at pH 4 to 7, most preferably at pH 5 to 6.5 determined on DMP.<br>
CtLccl enzyme functions at pH 3.5 to 8, preferably at pH 4 to 7, most preferably at pH 4.5 to 6 deteminer guaiacol.<br>
Of the mentioned pH ranges the first pH range means that 20 % or more of the maximal activity is on this region, the second pH range means that 40 % or more of the activity is on this region. The third region means that 80 % or more of the activity is on this region.<br>
The specific activities were determined towards ABTS, DMP, syringaldazine and guaiacol as described in Example 6. The specific activity of TaLcc2 was highest on ABTS, 360 nkat/mg at pH 4.5, of TaLcc3 8.3 nkat/mg at pH 4.5, of TaLcc4 1000 nkat/mg at pH 4.5, respectively. The specific activity of CtLccl was 705 nkat/mg at pH 4.5.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention are also laccase enzymes, which show at least 60 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:41 (TaLcc2) and have a specific activity of at least 300, preferably at least 350 nkat /mg towards ABTS at pH 4.5, laccase enzymes, which show at least 58 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:43 (TaLcc3) and have a specific activity of at least 7, preferably at least 8 nkat /mg towards ABTS at pH 4.5, laccase enzymes, which show at least 78 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:45 (TaLcc4) and have a specific activity of at least 900, preferably at least 1000 nkat /mg towards ABTS at pH 4.5.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention are also laccase enzymes, which show at least 74 % identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO.47 (CtLccl) and has a specific activity of at least 600, preferably at least 700 nkat /mg towards ABTS at pH 4.5.<br>
The production of laccase can also be improved by optimising the culture conditions and the culture medium of a wild or a recombinant strain. The carbon/nitrogen ratio can be optimised to be the best for the production of enzyme. The growing conditions, pH, temperature, mixing and air supply can be optimised to be the best possible for the enzyme production in question. In fermentation, inducers of laccase production, such as veratryl alcohol, xylidine, or lignin or other aromatic compounds can also be used. The way and the time of adding the inducers, as well as their concentration can be optimised.<br><br>
20<br>
The term "enzyme preparation" denotes here to any enzyme product, which contains at least one laccase enzyme. Thus, such an enzyme preparation may be a spent culture medium or filtrate containing one or more laccases or one or more laccases and other enzymes, an isolated laccase enzyme or a mixture of one or more laccase enzymes or a mixture of one or more laccase enzymes and one or more other enzymes. In addition to the laccase activity, such a preparation may contain additives, such as mediators, stabilizers, buffers, preservatives, surfactants and/or culture medium components. Preferred additives are such, which are commonly used in enzyme preparations intended for the application, where the enzyme preparation is used. The enzyme preparation may be in the form of liquid, powder or granulate.<br>
The enzyme preparation may comprise in addition to laccase, one or more other enzymes, which may be for example amylases, cellulases and/or peroxidases. Alternatively, before, during or after the laccase treatment of the present invention, another enzyme treatment may be carried out. The enzyme treatment may comprise, for example, one or more amylase treatments, one or more cellulase treatments and/or one or more peroxidase treatments. Which other enzymes are included to the enzyme preparation or are used in the enzyme treatment, depends on the application.<br>
The enzyme preparation may comprise one or more laccase enzymes of the present invention or other laccase enzymes together with one or more laccase enzymes of the present invention. For example, laccase enzymes having different properties may be combined to make the enzyme preparation more useful for different conditions.<br>
By "mediators" are here meant additives which are often needed for enhancing the effect of laccases. Many of the prior art laccases do not function or do not function effectively in the absence of mediators. Also the laccases obtainable from Thielavia or Chaetomium, function more effectively in the presence of mediators. Suitable mediators include, for example methylsyringate, acetosyringon, ethylsyringate, butylsyringate and laurylsyringate, propionic acid-phenothiazine (PPT) 2,2'azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazole-6-sulphonate (ABTS), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy (Tempo), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), violuric acid, N-hydroxy-acetanilide (NHA). The mediator may be used in the range 0.1 to 100 mg/ g or 0.1 to 100 ing/1, preferably 1 to 10 mg/g or 1 to 10 mg/1 of the treated material depending on the application.<br>
Denim bleaching<br>
The enzymes of the present invention are in particular suitable for denim bleaching. By "increasing lightness" of denim is here meant a visible and measurable increase in the lightness in denim fabric. By "increasing lightness" of denim is meant in particular increasing lightness of denim on the face side of<br><br>
21<br>
denim. The increase can be measured for example by measuring the colour as reflectance values with a chromameter using L*a*b* color space coordinates as described in Examples 7-10.<br>
"Bleached look" means the effects, which are obtained on denim fabric in the prior art by means of bleaching chemicals, e.g. sodium hypochlorite. So far the "chlorine bleaching" has been the most effective bleaching method for denim dyed with Indigo since almost all shades have been obtained with it. If a "white bleaching" effect has been desirable, the bleaching has been carried out 2 to 3 times one after the other in different treatment baths, or by using high concentrations of hypochlorite. Bleaching with glucose, sulphinic acid derivatives or laccases have been suggested for denim treatment to replace sodium hypochlorite.<br>
To "increase the lightness" of denim fabric, according to the prior art, treatment with various bleaching chemicals or enzymes is carried out. Bleaching is often done after treatment with cellulases or pumice stones or both.<br>
When using the laccases of the present invention, if more whitish effect is desired, higher dosages can be used or the enzyme treatment can be repeated or combined with other bleaching methods. The laccase treatment of the present invention can be combined also with any other bleaching treatment, with one or more chemical bleaching treatments or with one or more other enzyme treatments having capability of increasing lightness of denim.<br>
The denim treatment according to the invention comprises generally the following steps:<br>
desized or optionally desized and cellulase treated denim is contacted in aqueous medium with an effective amount of laccase enzyme under suitable conditions for the function of the enzyme; and one or more rinses with water are carried out.<br>
The laccase treatment is preferably carried out on cellulase treated denim. Laccase treatment is followed by one or more rinses with hot or cold water optionally with detergents. Enzyme inactivation is usually not needed after laccase treatment since it does not reduce the strength of fabric, but if needed it is carried out by methods well known to a person skilled in the art. The treatment is typically carried out in an equipment normally used for wet processes in textile industry, such as industrial machines used for washing, cellulase treatment, dyeing or finishing.<br>
By "denim" is in connection of this invention meant denim fabric, usually denim jeans.<br><br>
22<br>
Performance of the laccase preparations of the present invention in denim bleaching was exemplified at different pH-values as described in the Example 7. Recombinant laccase preparations produced using Thrichoderma as a host were tested for their ability to bleach denim and compared to a commercial laccase preparation DeniLite II Base fromNovozymes.<br>
Both CtLccl and TaLcc2 laccases were more efficient in decolorisation of indigo dye of denim compared to the prior art laccase at pH values 6 and 7 as can be seen in Table 18 and in Figure 8. The look of the denim fabric was in particular at pH 6 much lighter.<br>
The abilily of the laccases of the present invention to bleach denim at different temperatures was tested and compared to the prior art laccase as described in Example 8.<br>
CtLccl and in particular TaLcc2 were more efficient in decolorization of denim (higher increase of lightness) compared to the prior art laccase at 40 to 50 °C. The two enzymes are thus very suitable for use in applications where low temperatures are preferred. However, CtLcc 1 was more effective also at 60 °C and functions thus at broad temperature range.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of this invention denim treatment by the laccases of the present invention is carried out at the temperature of 30 to 80°C, preferably at the temperature of 40 to 70 °C, more preferably at the temperature of 40 to 60°C. The pH during the treatment may be in the range from pH 3 to 9, preferably from pH 4 to 8, most preferably from pH 5 to 7. The treatment may be carried out in 15 minutes to 2 hours, preferably in 30 minutes to 90 minutes, more preferably in 30 minutes to 60 minutes.<br>
The dosage used in the treatment can be 2 to 500 nkat, more preferably 20 to 200, most preferably 20 to 100 nkat/g fabric.<br>
By the laccase enzyme of the present invention any kind of denim fabric can be treated. Advantageously the denim is Indigo dyed denim. By "Indigo dyed" is here meant that the denim to be treated is dyed with Indigo, with derivatives of Indigo or denim dyed with Indigo together with some other dye, for example indigo-dyed denim with sulphur bottom.<br>
The denim fabric may be cellulase treated or stone washed, or both, or the denim fabric may be treated by laccase of the present invention already after desizing. Higher increasing of lightness of denim can be obtained when laccase treatment is carried out on cellulase treated fabric.<br><br>
23 The "desizing" process is normally the first wet treatment of jeans and means the removal of starch or<br>
other sizing agents applied usually to the warp yarns to prevent damage during the weaving process. Alpha-amylases are used to remove starch-based size for improved and uniform wet processing. After desizing the jeans are normally rinsed with water.<br>
The term "abraded" means here the appearance of denim fabric when it has been treated by cellulase enzymes or stone washed, or both. As a result of uneven dye removal there are contrasts between dyed areas and areas from which dye has been removed. Synonymous expressions are "stone washed look" or "worn look". The cellulase treatment may be done using neutral or acid cellulases or both. If a fabric is not cellulase treated or stone washed, the appearance of the fabric is said to be "dull", since the fashionable contrasts would be missing.<br>
Stain removal<br>
The laccase enzymes of the present invention can be used also for stain removal under similar conditions as in denim bleaching.<br>
According; to a preferred embodiment of this invention denim treatment by the laccases of the present invention is carried out at the temperature of 30 to 80°C, preferably at the temperature of 40 to 70 °C, more preferably at the temperature of 40 to 60°C. The pH during the treatment may be in the range from pH 3 to 9, preferably from pH 4 to 8, most preferably from pH 5 to 7. The treatment may be carried out in 15 minutes to 2 hours, preferably in 30 minutes to 90 minutes, more preferably in 30 minutes to 60 minutes.<br>
The dosage used in the treatment can be 0.2 to 2000 nkat/g of fabric, preferably 1 to 500, more preferably from 2 to 200 nkat/g of fabric.<br>
The laccases of the present invention and Denilite II Base laccase preparations were tested for their ability to remove stains as is described in Example 9. In the tests artificially soiled test cloths for grass soiling and for tea soiling were used with or without the mediator (methyl syringate). The dosages of the enzymes were 20 and 200 nkat/ g of fabric and the test was run at 40, 50 or 60°C and pH 6 for 60 min.<br>
As can be seen in Tables 21 and 22 and in Figures 10 to 13 CtLccl laccase was effective in removal of grass and tea soiling with mediator at 60°C and TaLcc2 laccase at 50°C. The effect was also seen at 40°C.<br><br>
24 Decolonization of dyes<br>
The laccase enzymes of the present invention can be used also in decolorization of dyes. Dye-house effluents, for example cannot be discharged to natural waters without degrading the dyes and/or decolorizing them. The decolorization can be carried out under similar conditions as used in denim bleaching. Suitable dosage of the enzyme and treatment time depends on the amount of the dye to be decolorized and the treatment conditions.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of this invention decolorization of dyes is carried out at the temperature of 30 to 80°C, preferably at the temperature of 40 to 70 °C, more preferably at the temperature of 40 to 60°C. The pH during the treatment may be in the range from pH 3 to 9, preferably from pH 4 to 8, most preferably from pH 5 to 7.<br>
The enzyme dosages and treatment times can be tested and chosen to be most suitable for the application. As guidance can be used dosages of 0.2 to 2000 nkat/ 1 of the treatment solution. The treatment time is preferably 15 min to 24 hours, more preferably 30 min to 12 hours. If the treatment is carried out at lower temperature, for example 18 to 30 °C the treatment time may be longer.<br>
As described in Example 10 the laccases of the present invention were tested for their ability to decolourize different dyes in the presence or absence of a mediator. CtLccl and TaLcc2 laccases were able to decolorize Indigocarmine and Remazol Brilliant Blue very effectively. Also Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-P was partly decolorized.<br>
Other applications<br>
Since the laccases of the present invention have high oxidizing capacity of various substrates, they are well suited for many industrial applications. Such applications are for example the manufacture of fibre products and applications of forest industry, applications in cosmetic industry and in industry preparing personal care and other applications. In these applications, the temperature and pH are on the area where the laccases of the present invention function. The dosage and treatment time can be chosen depending on the application and material to be treated.<br>
Mediators may be needed as additives to enhance the effect of the laccases of the present invention. In addition, it is essential that enough oxygen is brought to the reaction. If needed, oxygen can be added either by bringing air or oxygen or air enriched with oxygen to the reaction mixture.<br><br>
25<br>
The laccases of the present invention are suitable for use in textile industry, for treating man-made or natural fibers or their combinations. The enzyme is suitable for treating cellulosic fibers as well as proteinaceous fibers, such as wool or silk.<br>
The laccases of the present invention are suitable for use in forest industry. Lignin-containing fibres can be brought into contact with the laccase. Due to the laccase treatment, the strength properties of the fibres improve, which can be utilised, for example, in the manufacture of fibre boards, in paper or cardboard products and composites, which are made of mechanically ground lignin-containing fibres. Wood fibers can be treated with laccases of the present invention also to functionize them or glue the fibers.<br>
The laccases of the present invention are also well suited to depolymerization of various compounds. By using the laccases of the present invention lignin in kraft pulp can be depolymerised thereby producing a pulp with lower lignin content. Laccase can thus be used for bleaching of pulp to decrease the use of bleaching chemicals. As a result of the better bleachability of the pulp after laccase treatment, there is a reduction of the subsequent consumption of bleaching chemicals, which when chlorine containing chemicals are used, leads to a reduced formation of environmentally undesired organo-chlorine compounds.<br>
The laccases of the present invention can be used also for polymering compounds, such as lignin, to produce high molecular weight compounds.<br>
Because of the high oxidizing capacity of the enzyme it can be used for oxidizing of dyes or dye precursors or chromophoric compounds in cosmetic industry or in industry preparing products for personal care. The oxidation of the dyes leads to decolorization of the compounds. This effect can be used for example in hair dyeing or when whitening teeth. To carry out hair dyeing dye precursors or modifiers are usually needed.<br>
The laccase according to the invention can also be used to improve the runnability of paper machines. The laccase can be used to improve the runnability of paper machines by polymerising compounds originating from lignin and extractives and by decreasing the detrimental growth of microbes in the paper machine.<br>
Further possible applications where laccase enzymes of the present invention can be used are methods for improving doughs in baking applications, methods for clarifying beer and wine, use in improval of the production of fuel ethanol from renewable raw materials and use in various bioremediative processes as well as use in hard-surface cleaning or in detergent formulations.<br><br>
26 In general, in the mentioned applications the treatment temperature is preferably 30 to 80 °C, more<br>
preferably 40 to 70 °C, although reactions can be carried out also at lower temperatures. The pH may be 3 to 9, preferably 4 to 7. The treatment time may be 15 min to 24 hours, preferably 30 min to 2 hours. The dosage may be 0.1 to 2000, preferably 1 to 1000, more preferably 2 to 200 nkat/ g or 1 of the material to be treated. A suitable amount of mediator may be added.<br>
Compositions for the mentioned applications comprise the enzyme or enzyme preparation of the present invention in an effective amount and optionally additives suitable for the application in question. Compositions for textile industry may comprise for example a suitable amount of surface active agents, buffers, stabilizers and preservatives, compositions for forest industry may comprise for example a suitable amount of buffers, stabilizers and preservatives. In all compositions should be avoided substance:? harmful for environment and for human (or animal) use. In particular compositions for cosmetic industry and industry for personal care products should not contain harmful effects on skin or as ingested.<br>
The present invention provides composition for the treatment of denim comprising a laccase enzyme or an enzyme preparation according to the invention. The present invention provides also a composition for removal of stain, a composition for bleaching of pulp, a composition for treating of fibre for textile industry, a composition for treating of fibre for forest industry, a composition for treating of wool, a composition for treating of hair, a composition for treating of dye house effluent, and a composition for decolorizing of dyes comprising a laccase enzyme or an enzyme preparation according to the invention.<br>
The following examples are intended for illustration of the present invention and should not be interpreted as limiting the present invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE 1. Production and purification of the Thielavia arenaria and Chaetomium thermophilum laccase<br>
Production of the Thielavia arenaria and Chaetomium thermophilum laccase<br>
Various strains from the culture collection of Roal Oy were screened for their ability to produce laccases with indicators Remazol Brilliant Blue R-478, tannic acid, and guaiacol as described in Kiiskinen et al. (2004). Thielavia arenaria ALKO4197 showed positive reactions on guaiacol and Remazol Brilliant Blue R-478, and Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 showed strong positive reaction, when 5 mM ABTS solution in 25 mM succinate buffer (pH 4.5) or in 25 mM Mcllvaine buffer (pH 6.0) was dropped onto fresh mycelium on agar plates.<br><br>
27<br>
Both iimgi were maintained on PD agar (Difco) at +4°C. The inoculation and production medium contained: 25 g/1 glucose (AnalaR), 27.5 g/1 Bacto yeast extract (Difco), 0.5 mg/ml Indulin AT (Sigma), 0.04 l/l mineral solution (1.0 g/1 CaCl2 • 2H2O (Riedel-de Haen), 1.0 g/1 FeSO4 • 7H2O (Riedel-de Haen), 0.1 g/1 ZnSO4 • 7H2O (Merck), 0.16 g/1 CuSO4 • 5H2O (Merck), 1.0 g/1 Na2EDTA (Riedel-de Haen)). Glucosie was sterilized separately and combined aseptically to the medium.<br>
The Ttiielavia arenaria ALKO4197 strain was cultivated in 50 or 200 ml volume on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at temperature of 37°C. The medium was inoculated with 5 or 20 ml of well-grown mycelia. The laccase activity was followed up to eight days and the highest laccase activity (about 20 nkat/ml) was reached after six days of cultivation (Figure 1A). Six parallel cultivations were made. Cells were removed from the fermentation broth by centrifugation (10 000 g for 10 min, at +4°C) and the culture filtrate was further purified.<br>
The C. thermophilum ALKO4265 strain was cultivated in 50 or 200 ml volume on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at temperature of 42°C. The medium was inoculated with 5 or 20 ml of well-grown mycelia. The laccase activity was followed up to four days and the highest laccase activity (about 170 nkat/ml) was reached after three days of cultivation (Figure IB). Six parallel cultivations were made. Cells were removed from the fermentation broth by centrifugation (10 000 g for 10 min, at +4°C) and the culture filtrate was further purified.<br>
Purification of the Thielavia and Chaetomium laccases<br>
Concentrated culture filtrate of the crude Thielavia laccase was first loaded on Q Sepharose FF column (Pharmacia, V=26 ml), which was pre equilibrated with 10 mM Tris HCL, pH 8.5. Proteins were eluted with an increasing salt gradient (0-500 mM Na2SO4 in the equilibrating buffer, within 5 column volumes). Laccase active fractions eluted at 70-150 mM salt concentration and they were pooled and loaded on Sephacryl SI00 gel filtration resin (Pharmacia, V=160 ml), which was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mM NaCl. Purification was followed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant Blue (Figure 2A). Laccase positive fractions were pooled and concentrated. Salts were removed and buffer changed to 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.0. hi order to obtain high purity samples an additional Resource Q anion exchange step was included. The sample was loaded onto a Resource Q column (Pharmacia, V= lml), which was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris HC1 pH 8.5. Proteins were eluted with a linear 1-300 mM Na2SO4 salt gradient within 12 column volumes.<br><br>
28 The culture supernatant of C. thermophilum was concentrated and the buffer changed to the binding<br>
buffer by ultrafiltration (MWCO 10 000). Proteins were bound to DEAE Sepharose FF (Pharmacia, column volume 25 ml) at 20 mM Tris-buffer pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with a sodium sulphate gradient (0-500 mM). The laccase positive fractions eluted at 150 -200 mM salt concentration, and they were pooled and further purified with hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Phenyl Sepharose FF, Pharmacia, column volume 22 ml). Proteins were bound at 500 mM sodium sulphate concentration, at 20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.0, and eluted with a decreasing salt gradient (500 - 0 mM). The laccase positive fractions eluted with 20 mM Tris buffer. Purity of the fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassive staining (Figure 2B.).<br>
Enzyme activity assay<br>
The laccase activity from the culture supernatant was measured using ABTS as substrate. The activity assay was carried out in accordance with the method developed by Niku-Paavola et al. (1988). The sample was diluted with 0.025 M succinate buffer, pH 4.5. 0.350 ml of ABTS solution (11 g/1) was added to 1.15 ml of the dilution, and the reaction was followed for 2 minutes by the Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 436 ran. The activity is expressed as nano katals.<br>
Determination of protein contents<br>
The protein contents were determined by the DC Protein Assay kit of Bio-Rad, based on a method developed by Lowry et al. (1951). The assays were carried outaccording to the supplier's instructions, and the intensity of the colour formed in the reaction was measured on a wavelength of 750 nm using the. Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 spectrophotometer. A standard curve was defined using bovine serum albumin in concentrations of 0.25-1.25 g/1 (BSA, Bio-Rad).<br>
EXAMPLE 2. Characterization of the purified C. thermophilum laccase<br>
Molecular weight and pi<br>
Molecular weight of the 71 arenaria and C. thermophilum laccases were determined on SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (1970) The gels used in the SDS-PAGE analysis were ready-made 12% Tris HC1 gels (BioRad). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R 350; Pharmacia) and compared with molecular weight markers (Prestained Protein Marker Broad Range #7708S; New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.). The molecular weight of the both laccases was approximately 80 kDa. The isoelectric point of the laccases was determined with isoelectric focusing<br><br>
29<br>
within the pH range of 3-9 (Pharmalyte IEF, Pharmacia) on a LKB 2117 Multiphor II Electrophoresis System (LKB Pharmacia, Bromma, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bands containing laccase activity were visualized by staining the gel with 2 raM ABTS in 25 mM succinate buffer (pH 4.5) and proteins by Coomassie Blue staining. The purified Thielavia laccase showed multiple bands in isoelectric focusing at pis 5.5, 5.9, 6.4, 6.8, and 6.9. The purified C. thermophilum laccase showed 3-4 bands in isoelectric focusing at pis 4.1-4.3.<br>
pH optimum<br>
The pH-optimum of the T. arenaria and C. thermophilum laccases were determined in the universal Mcllvaine buffer within a pH range of 2.2-8.0 using guaiacol as substrate. The pH optima determined for the purified and crude Thielavia laccase are shown in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3A the pH optimum for Thielavia laccase is at 5.5, the enzyme shows substantially high activity still at pH 7, above which the activity starts to drop. The pH optimum of the purified and crude C. thermophilum laccase is at 5.0 (Fig. 3B).<br>
Thermal stability<br>
Thermal stability of the laccases were determined by incubating the enzyme solution (0.3 g I"1) in 60 mM citrate buffer (pH 6). The residual enzyme activities were measured at on ABTS. As shown from the results the half lives of the Thielavia laccase was 26 and 5.5 hrs at 50, and 60 °C, respectively (Fig. 4A), and for C. thermophilum 30 and 6 hrs 50, and 60 °C, respectively (Fig. 4B).<br>
Specific activity<br>
Specific activities of the purified T. arenaria and C. thermophilum laccases were determined towards different laccase substrates. The activities were determined towards ABTS (Niku-Paavola et al., 1988), di-metoxy-phenol (DMP) (Schlosser et al., 1997), syringaldazine (Paszczynski et al., 1985), and guaiacol (Leonowicz &amp; Grzywnowicz, 1981). For ABTS the activity measurements were carried out in 25 mM succinate buffer pH 4.5 at 25°C and for other substrates in 25 mM MES buffer, pH 5.5. Results are shown in Tab le 1.<br><br>
30<br>
Table 1. Specific activities of the purified wild type Thxelavia (TaLcc) and Chaetomium. (CtL) laccases.<br><br>
Inhibition of the laccase<br>
The effect of various inhibitors on laccase activity was determined by measuring the oxygen consumption during the enzyme reaction with ABTS in sealed and fully filled Erlenmeyer flasks with an Orion Research 081010 oxygen electrode (Software: SensorLink(tm) PCM800; Orion, Espoo, Finland). The oxygen consumption rates were measured from solutions containing suitable amout of the laccase, 2 raM ABTS, and various inhibitors in different concentrations, in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 5) in a 30 ml reaction volume<br><br>
N-terminal and internal amino acid sequencing<br>
The N-terminus of the protein as well as the internal peptides were sequenced according to Edman degradation chemistry (Edman and Begg, 1967) using PE Biosystems Precise Sequencer. For peptide preparation, the lyophilized protein was reduced with dithiotreitol, carboxymethylated with iodoacetamide and cleaved with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at enzyme/substrate mass ratios 1:100 for 12 hours at 37 C in 0.1 M ammoniumbicarbonate, pH 8.3 (Stone et al., 1988). Generated<br><br>
31 peptides were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Vydac<br>
C-18 column) with a linear acetonitrile gradient (0-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The internal peptide sequences for Thielavia laccase are shown in Table 3 (SEQ ID NO: 1 - 3). The N-terminus of the protein could not be obtained, because it was presumably blocked. Amino acid sequences obtained from the Chaetomium-laccase are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO: 4 - 7). The sequences of the peptides 2:2.4 and 22.7 from Chaetomium were obtained after the corresponding laccase gene had been cloned.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3. Cloning of the Thielavia arenaria ALKO4197 and Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 laccase genes<br>
Standard molecular biology methods were used in the isolation and enzyme treatments of DNA (plasmids, DNA fragments), in E. coli transformations, etc. The basic methods used are described in the standard molecular biology handbooks, e.g. Sambrook et al. (1989) and Sambrook and Russell (2001).<br>
The genomic libraries of Thielavia arenaria ALKO4197 and Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 were made to Lambda DASH*1!! vector (Stratagene, USA) according to the instructions from the<br><br>
32 supplier. The chromosomal DNAs, isolated by the method of Raeder and Broda (1985), were partially<br>
digested with Sau3A. The digested DNAs were size-fractionated and the fragments of the chosen size (9-23 kb) were dephosphorylated and ligated to the BamHl digested lambda vector arms. The ligation mixtures were packaged using either Gigapack III XL (Thielavia) or Gigapack III Gold (Chaetomium) packaging extracts according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, USA). The titers of the Thielavia and Chaetomium genomic libraries were 1.2 x 106 and 3.6 x 106 pfu/ml and those of the amplified libraries were 1.1 x 1010 and 6.5 x 1010 pfu/ml, respectively.<br>
The probes for screening the gene banks were amplified by PCR using the Thielavia ALKO4197 and Chaetomium ALKO4265 genomic DNAs as templates in the reactions. First, several primers (degenerate oligos) were planned and tested in PCR reactions (Table 5, SEQ ID NO: 8-31). The sequences of the homologous primers based on the amino acid sequences of the peptides from the purified TaLccl and CtLccl and the heterologous primers were planned according to the conserved laccase sequences (Fig. 5). The conserved sequences were identified by aligning the previously published amino acid sequences of Neurospora, Podospora, Cryphonectria, Myceliophthora, Scytalidium and Coprinus laccases (EMBL accession numbers P10574, P78722, Q03966, AAE68088, AAE68087, AAE63570, AAE63572, and AAE63571). In addition, a heterologous probe was amplified from the N. crassa laccase gene (genomic DNA from N. crassa strain ATCC9277 was used as a template), using primers POX 12 and POX 13 designed according to the published nucleotide sequence (Table 5). The combinations of the primers for the PCR reactions were selected according to the location of the peptide or the peptide homologue in the published laccase sequences. The PCR reaction mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 % DMSO, 1.5-3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 uM each primer and 1-2 units of Dynazyme EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) and 1-5 jag of the genomic DNA. The conditions for the PCR reactions were the following: 5 min initial denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 25-30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min annealing at 50 °C (Thielavia DNA as a template) or at 50 or 42°C {Chaetomium DNA as a template), 2 min extension at 72 °C and a final extension at 72 °C for 7-10 min.<br><br>
33<br><br>
DNA products having the expected sizes (calculated from the published fungal laccase sequences) were obtained from several reactions. In some of the PCR reactions, several bands were detected that had very similar sizes; e.g. three bands of about 0.2 kb were obtained with the primers POX8 and POX11 from the reactions with Chaetomium DNA. This suggested that several laccase genes can be found. The DNA fragment!? having the expected sizes were isolated from the most specific PCR reactions and they were cloned to pCR(r) Blunt-TOPO(r) vector (Invitrogen, USA). The inserts were characterized by sequencing and by performing Southern blot hybridizations to the genomic DNAs digested with several restriction enzymes.<br>
The PCR products obtained from both the Thielavia and Chaetomium reactions were found to contain sequences: from three different genes, according to the hybridization patterns and sequencing. Three<br><br>
34 PCR fragments, each representing a different putative laccase gene (Table 6, SEQ ID NO: 32 - 37), were<br>
chosen from both Thielavia and Chaetomiwn reactions to be used as probes for screening the gene banks. The deduced amino acid sequences from all these probes had homology to several published laccase sequences (BLAST program, version 2.2.9 at NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; Altschul et al., 1990). In addition to the homologous probes, the heterologous N. crassa laccase fragment was used for screening both the gene banks.<br><br>
The N. crassa laccase fragment and the inserts from the plasmids listed in Table 6 were labeled by using digoxigenin according to the supplier's instructions (Roche, Germany). The amplified genomic libraries (8xlO4 - lxlO6 plaques) were screened with the homologous probe fragments and with the N. crassa laccase fragment. The hybridization temperature for the filters was 68°C and the filters were washed 2x5 min at RT using 2xSSC-0.1% SDS followed by 2x15 min at 68°C using 0.1xSSC-0.1% SDS when the homologous probes were used. The filters probed with the N. crassa laccase fragment were washed 2x5 min at RT using 2xSSC-0.1% SDS followed by 2x15 min at 68°C using 2xSSC-0.1% SDS. Several positive plaques were obtained from each of the hybridizations. Some of the positive plaques were strongly hybridizing to the probe in question but, in addition, there was an amount of plaques hybridizing more weakly to the probes. This again suggested that there would be other laccase genes in the genomes, having cross-reaction to the probes used. From two to eight strongly hybridizing plaques were purified from each screening. The phage DNAs were isolated and characterized by Southern blot hybridizations. The chosen restriction fragments hybridizing to the probe were subcloned to pBluescript II KS+ or SK+ vectors and the relevant regions of the clones were sequenced.<br><br>
35<br>
A total of four laccase genes were cloned from Thielavia arenaria ALKO4197 and three from Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265. The Table 7 summarizes the information on the probes used for screening the genes, the phage clones from which the genes were isolated, the chosen restriction fragments containing the full-length genes with their promoter and terminator regions, the plasmid names, and the DSM deposit numbers for the E. coli strains carrying these plasmids.<br><br>
The sequences of the laccase genes are shown in Fig. 6. The relevant information on the genes and the deduced protein sequences are summarized in Table 8 and Table 9, respectively.<br>
The peptide sequences of the purified TaLccl and CtLccl (Tables 3 and 4) were found from the deduced amino acid sequences of the clones containing the Talccl and Ctlccl genes (some inaccuracies were found from the peptide sequences after the deduced amino acid sequences were available). Thus, it could be concluded that the genes encoding the purified laccase proteins TaLccl and CtLccl were cloned. The synthesis of PCR fragments from the Talccl gene was successful when the PCR primers were designed according to the TaLccl peptide sequences (POX28+POX31 and POX27+POX31). However, due to the inaccuracies in the peptide sequencing, the cloning of Ctlccl succeeded only when the primers deriving from the homologous fungal laccase sequences were used. The Thielavia laccase gene Talcc4 was obtained by using the N. crassa probe in the screening of the genomic library. No additional laccase genes were found from the plaques picked and purified from the Chaetomium library probed with the N. crassa laccase fragment.<br><br>

" There are two possible translation start sites for the Talcc2 gene. The predicted signal peptides and other values were obtained using the longer sequence. The predicted signal sequence would be 17 amino acids for the polypeptide encoded by the shorter gene (the deduced sequence 579 amino acids) .<br>
" There are two possible translation start sites for the Ctlcc3 gene. The deduced ammo acid sequence for the shorter polypeptide is 607 amino acids, MW 62 029 Da and pi 4,65. No predicted signal sequence was detected from either of the deduced amino acid sequences.<br>
The deduced amino acid sequences of TaLccl and CtLccl were found to be the most homologous to each other, as were also the TaLcc3 and CtLcc2 (also at the gene level, e.g. in the organization of introns of the respective genes). The identity value obtained for TaLccl and CtLccl using Needleman-Wunsch global alignment (EMBLOSUM62, Gap penalty 10.0, Extend penalty 0.5; European Molecular Biology Open Softv/are Suite program package, version 2.9.0) was 69.5% and that for TaLcc3 and CtLcc2 was 67.3% (Table 10). The identity values of the other laccase proteins were lower, when aligned with each other and with TaLccl, CtLccl, TaLcc3 and CtLcc2 (Table 10).<br><br>
The highest homologies of the deduced TaLccl and CtLccl sequences (BLAST program, version 2.2.9 at NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; Altschul et al., 1990) were to the laccases from Melanocarpus albomyces, Podospora anserina and Neurospora crassa (EMBL accession numbers CAE00180,, LAC2_PODAN, LAC1_NEUCR/XP_323881/KSNCLO). The highest identities of TaLccl and CtLcc 1 to the laccases in the patent database were to laccases from Myceliophthora thermophila (EP 0765394 Bl) and Scytalidium thermophilum (US 5,750,388). The other deduced laccase sequences did not have as high identities to the previously published sequences. The highest identities of TaLcc3 and<br><br>
38<br>
CtLcc2 were to Magnaporthe grisea hypothetical protein (EAA57158.1) and to Collecotrichum lagenarium laccase (BAB32575). The highest homologies of the other laccases to the previously published sequences were as follows: TaLcc2 to N. crassa hypothetical protein (XP330977), TaLcc4 to Gibberella zeae hypothetical protein (EAA68613), CtLcc3 to N. crassa and Magnaporthe grisea hypothetical proteins (XP324706 and EAA47633). Thus, also other fungal species have similar sequences but these sequences have not yet been identified as laccases. The sequences found from the databases, having at least 50% identity to the deduced amino acid sequences of the laccases from Thielavia ALKO4197 and Chaetomium ALKO4265, are shown in Table 11.<br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 4. Production of recombinant laccases in Trichoderma reesei<br>
Expression plasmids were constructed for production of the recombinant TaLccl, TaLcc2, TaLcc3, TaLcc4, CtLccl and CtLcc2 proteins. The expression cassette was not constructed for production of CtLcc3 due to lack of a predicted signal sequence in the deduced amino acid sequence. The expression plasmids constructed are listed in Table 12. The laccase genes, including their own signal sequences, were exactly fused to the T. reesei cbhl (cel7A) promoter by PCR. The cbhl promoter, cbhl terminator, amdS marker and the cbhl 3' flanking region included were as described in Paloheimo et al. (2003). The linear expression cassettes (Fig. 7), were isolated from the vector backbones and were transformed to T. reesei A47 protoplasts. The transformations were performed as in Penttila et al. (1987) with the modifications described in Karhunen et al. (1993). The transformants were purified on selection plates through single conidia prior to sporulating them on PD.<br><br>
40<br><br>
The laccase production of the transformants was analysed from the culture supernatants of the shake flask cultivations (50 ml). The transformants were grown for 7 days in a complex lactose-based cellulase-inducing medium (Joutsjoki et al. 1993) buffered with 5% KH2PO4 and supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO4 at pH 6.0. The laccase activity was assayed using ABTS as a substrate as described in Example 1. Laccase activity was obtained from all the constructs. The possible targeting of the expression cassette to the cbhl (cel7A) locus was screened as a CBHI-negative phenotype by dot blot (Minifold I-SRC 96 dot blotter, Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Dassel, Germany) or by Western blot. The detection of the CBHI protein was performed using the monoclonal antibodies CI-258 or CI-261 (Aho et al., 1991) and the ProtoBlot Western blot AP system (Promega). The genotypes of the chosen transformants were confirmed by using Southern blots in which several genomic digests were included and the respective expression cassette was used as a probe.<br>
The chosen CBHI-negative transformants were cultivated in fermentors to obtain material for purification of the recombinant proteins (Example 5) and for the application tests (Examples 7 - 10).<br><br>

The purified recombinant Thielavia and Chaetomium laccases were characterized in terms of pH optimum, thermal stability, and pi as described in Example 2. The molecular weight was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Ultraflex(tm) time-of-flight instrument (BrukerDaltonics, Germany) as previously described (Palonen et al., 2003). The redox-potentials of the Tl coppers of for CtLcc, and TaLcc2 laccases were determined by photometric copper titration in 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 6.0) as described by Xu et al. (1996) using the redox titrant couple K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6. The redox potential of TaLccl was determined with a combined Pt-AgCl/KCl microelectrode at pH 5.0 according to Sigoillot et al (2004). The characterization results are collected to Table 14.<br><br>
The inhibition effect of different compounds on the activity of the laccases was determined as described in Example 2. except with Talcc4, with which the inhibition was analyzed using spectroscopic activity assay. Instead of following oxygen consumption in the ABTS reaction, the enzyme activity was determined spectrofotometrically. Because the activity of TaLcc3 was very low with all tested substrates the inhibition experiments with this enzyme were not carried out. Results are shown in Table 15.<br><br>
43<br><br>
Specific activities of the purified Thielavia and Chaetomium laccases were determined towards ABTS, dimetoxy phenol (DMP), syringaldazine, and guaiacol as described in Example 2. The ABTS activity measurements were carried out in 25 mM succinate buffer pH 4.5 at 25°C, and the other activities in 25 mM MES buffer, pH 5.5. The results are shown in Table 16.<br><br>
Kinetic parameters of the Thielavia and Chaetomium laccases<br>
The kinetic parameters, Michaelis-Menthen constant Km, turn-over number kca, and the specificity constant (k^/Km) were determined on ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxy phenol (DMP), and syringaldatzin. The measurements on ABTS were done in 25 mM succinate buffer, pH 4.5. On syringaldazin and DMP 40 mM MES buffer, pH 6 was used.. All activity assays were carried out at 25°C. Kinetic parameters were estimated by a nonlinear regression curve fit. The results are shown in Table 4. The values were compared to those of Melanocarpus albomyces MaL, laccase.<br><br>
AA<br><br>
The biochemical data presented here clearly indicates that the recombinant CtLccl is the same protein as the wild type Chaetomium laccase purified from the culture supernatant and the recombinant TaLccl is the same protein as the wild type Thielavia laccase purified from the culture supernatant.<br>
EXAMPLE 7. Performance of laccase preparations in denim bleaching at different pH values<br>
The recombinant laccase preparations produced using Trichoderma as a host were used in all the application tests, in Examples 7-10. The recombinant laccases CtLccl, TaLcc2 and TaLcc4, derived from strains RF5469, RF5573 and RF5687, respectively, were tested for their ability to bleach denim. The commercial laccase preparation DeniLite II Base from Novozymes was used as comparison.<br>
Lee Cooper jeans (MASI Company Oy, Finland) that were desized and treated with neutral ECOSTONE(r) cellulase were used as test material. Laccase treatments were performed in LP-2 Launder Ometer as follows. About 10 g of denim swatches (15 x 14 cm) were loaded into 1.2 liter containers containing 200 ml Me Ilvaine's citrate phosphate buffer pH 5, 6 or 7 and the containers were temperated. Enzyme with or without the mediator (methyl syringate, DeniLite II Assist, Novozymes) was added as laccase activity units. Enzyme was dosed 200 nkat/g and the mediator 10 mg/g on the weight of fabric. Enzyme activity was measured with ABTS substrate (Example 1) but using citrate phosphate buffer in all examples 7 -10. The Launder Ometer was run at 50°C for 30 min and after that the temperature in Launder was raised to 80 °C for 10 min. The swatches were carefully rinsed with warm water, dried half-dry in a tumbler and after that air dried.<br><br>
45<br>
The bleaching effect was evaluated by measuring the colour as reflectance values with the Minolta Chrornameter CM 1000 (Minolta Co.) using L*a*b* color space coordinates (illuminant D65). The colour from both sides of the swatches was measured before and after the laccase treatment. Each measurement was the average of several measurements.<br>
Table 18 and Fig. 8 show that both CtLccl and TaLcc2 laccases were more efficient in decolorization of indigo dye of denim compared to DeniLite II Base at pH values 6 and 7. At pH 6 the look of the denim fabric was distinctly much lighter with these two laccases than with DeniLite also by visual evaluation. Without the mediator the laccases did not have notable effect on denim (Table 19).<br><br><br>
46<br><br>
EXAMPLE 8. Performance of laccase preparations in denim bleaching at different temperatures<br>
Laccases CtLccl, TaLccl (Example 7) and TaLcc2 (strain RF5573) were tested for their ability to bleach denim at different temperatures compared to commercial laccase preparation DeniLite II Base from Novozymes.<br>
The test system and denim were as in Example 7, except that the conditions during the laccase and mediator treatment in Launder were 30 min, pH 6 and temperature 30 - 70°C (DeniLite II Base also at 80°C) and the enzyme was inactivated by alkaline treatment instead of raising the temperature in Launder as follows. After removing swatches from the containers they were soaked in warm water containing NaOH (pH 11.5) for 10 min and rinsed carefully with warm water. The swatches were dried half-dry in a tumbler and after that air dried. The bleaching effect was evaluated by measuring the colour as reflectance values as in Example 7.<br><br>
47<br>
Table 20 and Fig. 9 show that CtLccl and especially TaLcc2 laccases were more efficient in decolorizadon of denim (highest increase of lightness) compared to the commercial laccase Denilite II Base at 40 - 50 °C and pH 6. TaLcc2 laccase is the most suitable enzyme for applications performed at low temperatures. CtLccl and TaLcc2 had also better bleaching effect at their optimal temperatures than DeniLite It base at its optimum<br><br>
Example 9. Stain removal with laccases<br>
Laccases CtLccl, TaLcc2, TaLcc4 and Denilite II Base (Example 7) were tested for their ability to remove stains. The following artificially soiled test cloths were used: grass soiling (Art. 164, EMPA Testmaterialen, Germany), tea soiling (Art. 167, EMPA Testmaterialen, Germany). The fabric was cut in 5.8 x 5.8 cm swatches. Laccase treatments were performed in LP-2 Launder Ometer as follows. About 5 g of soiled fabrics were loaded into 1.2 liter containers containing 150 ml Me Ilvaine's citrate phosphate<br><br>
48 buffer pH 6 and the containers were temperated. Enzyme with or without the mediator (methyl syringate,<br>
DeniLite II Assist, Novozymes) was added as laccase activity units (Example 7). Enzyme was dosed 200 nkat/g and the mediator 10 mg/g on the weight of fabric, except at 40°C dosages of 20 nkat/g and 2 mg/g were also used. The Launder Ometer was run at 40, 50 or 60°C and pH 6 for 60 min. After that the swatches were carefully rinsed under running water and in shake flasks containing warm water and dried in the air.<br>
The stain removal effect was evaluated by measuring the colour as reflectance values using L*a*b* color space coordinates (Example 7). The colour of the swatches was measured before and after the laccase treatment.<br>
The results of stain removal tests are shown in Tables 21- 22 and Figures 10 - 13. CtLccl laccase was effective in removal of grass soiling with the mediator at 60°C and TaLcc2 laccase at 50°C , that can be seen in increased lightness and especially in reduced greenness values in Fig. 10, and also clearly by visual estimation. Similar trend can be seen at 40°C (Fig. 12). CtLccl laccase had some effect without the mediator too, especially at 60°C. TaLcc4 laccase had a slight effect on grass (greenness reduced ca. 2 units) at 50°C. Without the mediator the efficiency in stain removal with laccases was low, especially at 40°C.<br>
CtLccl laccase was effective in removal of tea soiling with the mediator at 60°C and TaLcc2 laccase at 50°C , that can be seen in reduced redness and especially in increased lightness values in fig. 11, and also clearly by visual estimation. Same trend can be seen at 40°C (Fig. 13). Without the mediator the laccases did not have a notable effect on tea stain, especially at 40°C.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 10. Decolorization of dyes using laccase preparations<br>
The recombinant laccases CtLccl, TaLcc2 and TaLcc4, derived from Trichoderma strains (Example 7) were tested for their ability to decolorize different dyes in the presence of the methyl syringate mediator (Example 7) or without it. The experiments were carried out in 100 ml shake flasks containing 50 ml of dye dissolved in citrate phosphate buffer pH 6. Dye concentration 5 mg/50 ml was used. Enzyme was dosed 100 nkat per 50 ml and the mediator 5 mg per 50 ml. Control samples contained only dye solution. The shake flasks were incubated at 50°C for 30, 60 and 120 minutes. Samples of 3.5 ml were taken in test tubes for visual evaluation.<br>
The results are shown in Table 23 and 24. CtLccl and TaLcc2 laccases were able to decolourize Indigocarmine and Remazol Brilliant Blue (Reactive Blue 19) to great extend or completely and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-P partly in the presence of the mediator. Degradation of Indigocarmine was fast, £ind the blue colour had turned to light yellow in already 30 min or earlier. The reaction seemed to be completed after 60 min with all dyes, since no visually detectable changes in the colours of the samples were observed any more.<br><br><br>
