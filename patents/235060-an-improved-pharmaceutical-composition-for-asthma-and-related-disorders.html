INCORPORATED UNDER THE INDIAN COMPANIES ACT, 1913, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 289, BELLASIS ROAD, MUMBAI CENTRAL, MUMBAI - 400 008, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA;<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is concerned with pharmaceutical combinations of β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists and anti-cholinergic agents and the therapeutic use thereof, particularly in the prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory diseases. In particular, the present invention is concerned with pharmaceutical formulations comprising combinations of β -2 adrenoreceptor agonists and anti-cholinergic agents and the therapeutic use thereof, particularly in the prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
The path physiology of asthma or related disorders involves bronchoconstriction resulting from bronchial smooth muscle spasm and airway inflammation with mucosal edema. Treatment of asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) and other related disorders have been known to be treated with β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists also known as p-2 receptor agonists. Such β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists are known to provide a bronchodilator effect to patients, resulting in relief from the symptoms of breathlessness. More particularly, β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists have been shown to increase the conductance of potassium channels in airway muscle cells, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and relaxation.<br>
It has also been seen that a subgroup of P-2 adrenoreceptor agonists can be described as short acting, whilst a further subgroup of p-2 adrenoreceptor agonists can be described as long acting. The mechanism of anti-asthmatic<br><br><br>
action of the short acting subgroup is linked to the direct relaxation of airway smooth muscles and consequent bronchodilation. Drugs belonging to this short acting subgroup have quicker onset of action (within 1-15 minutes) and produce a bronchodilation that lasts for about 2-6 hours. Such drugs act as "rescue" medication i.e. where immediate relief is required. The long acting subgroup of drugs act via a similar mechanism i.e. relaxation of airway smooth muscles and consequent bronchodilation. Drugs of this long acting subgroup may have delayed onset of action, but have a longer duration of action, so are used for long-term regular treatment of reversible airways obstruction in asthma.<br>
Short acting β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists include terbutaline, salbutamol, lev-albuterol, R, R-formoterol, metaprotemol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, bitolterol mesylate, fenoterol, procaterol and the like. Long acting β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists include salmeterol and formoterol. For example, it has been reported that inhalation of salmeterol provides persistent bronchodilation lasting over 12 hours. The extended side chain on salmeterol renders it greatly lipophilic. This lipophilicity regulates the diffusion rate away from the receptor by determining the degree of partitioning in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. Subsequent to binding the receptor, the less lipophilic, short acting agonists are rapidly removed from the receptor environment by diffusion in aqueous phase. Unbound salmeterol, by contrast, persists in the membrane and only slowly dissociates from the receptor environment.<br><br><br>
A further component of asthma is inflammation, which is treated with steroids. Also, steroids have been known to make bronchodilators more effective. If combined with bronchodilators, lower doses of steroids have been needed to achieve the same effect.<br>
Bronchoconstriction and inflammation are also associated with bronchial plugging with secretions, which is known to be treated with anti-cholinergic agents. These agents prevent increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP that are caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle. Available anti-cholinergics reported are ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide, tiotropium bromide and the like. An important therapeutic property of ipratropium and tiotropium is their minimal inhibitory effect on mucociliary clearance, relative to atropine. Hence, the use of these agents in patients with airway disease avoids the increased accumulation of lower airway secretions encountered with atropine. Ipratropium and oxitropium bromide have a shorter duration of action. More particularly, it has been seen that after inhalation, maximal responses usually develop over 30 to 90 minutes for ipratropium and oxitropium, with tiotropium having a slower onset. The effects of ipratropium last for 4 to 6 hours, while tiotropium's effects persist for 24 hours. Ipratropium and oxitropium can thus be classified as short acting anti-cholinergic agents, whereas tiotropium can be classified as a long acting anti-cholinergic agent, based on the above described durations of action.<br><br><br>
It has also been reported that combined treatment of anti-cholinergics with β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists results in slightly greater and more prolonged bronchodilation than with either agent alone in the treatment of baseline asthma. Such combination products provide combination treatment of airway constriction and inflammation. Furthermore, combination of anti-cholinergics, such as ipratropium bromide, and β-2 adrenoreceptor agonists, such as salbutamol, is known to provide an effective therapy to reduce constriction and to reduce bronchial secretions. All these medicaments are known to be given in different dosage forms, for example MDIs, DPIs, oral and liquid formulations. Treatment with these different categories of medication calls for the patient to comply with different doses, different frequencies of doses and the like.<br>
Despite the large numbers of known treatments of respiratory diseases as discussed above, there continues to exist a clinical need for therapies of respiratory diseases which exhibit advantageous profiles of action. To this end, it has surprisingly been found that a combination of short acting and long acting β—2 adrenoreceptor agonists, with short acting and long acting anti¬cholinergics provide an enhanced, synergistic therapeutic effect in terms of treatment of respiratory diseases, such as bronchoconstriction, inflammation, mucous secretions and related disorders. Also, such combination therapy is an extremely patient-friendly combination, which results in enhanced patient compliance and better control of respiratory diseases, such as asthma, compared to known combinations.<br><br><br>
