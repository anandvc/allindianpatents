				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus which transfers a toner image borne on an image bearing member onto a recording material,<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a conventional electrophotographic technology, there is a technology which inserts a recording material between an image bearing member bearing a toner image thereon and a transfer roller and transfers the toner image on the image bearing member onto the recording material.<br>
In this technology, U.S. Patent No. 6516179 discloses how a recording material enters a transfer nip.  An image forming apparatus described in this U.S. Patent No. 6516179 has a guide member which guides the recording material toward a secondary transfer nip portion of an intermediate transfer belt. A leading end of the recording material is first brought into contact with the intermediate transfer belt by this guide member so that the recording material advances toward the secondary transfer nip along the intermediate transfer belt.<br><br>
However, an advancing method of the recording material toward the secondary transfer nip such as one in the image forming apparatus in U.S. Patent No, 6516179 may produce a phenomenon that the leading end portion of the recording material removes a toner image on the intermediate transfer belt in some cases. Further, removal of the toner image by the leading end portion of the recording material generates an image deficit.  This image deficit hardly occurs when a sufficient margin is assured at an edge on the leading end side of the recording material, but this image deficit remarkably appears when a margin is small or when an image without a margin is formed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An image forming apparatus according to the present invention will now be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. <first embodiment><br>
A preferred embodiment according to the present invention will now be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings .  However, dimensions, materials, shapes, relative arrangements and others of constituent components described in the following embodiment should be appropriately changed based on a configuration or various kinds of conditions of an apparatus to which the present invention is applied, and a scope of the present invention is not restricted thereto unless a specific description is given in particular.<br>
A description will be given as to an image forming apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention with reference to Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4..  Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram showing a color image forming apparatus using an intermediate transfer mode according to the first embodiment.<br>
In the color image forming apparatus adopting the intermediate transfer mode shown in Fig. 2, toner images having various colors are formed on respective photosensitive rollers 2 in a plurality of image<br><br>
forming portions.  The plurality of image forming parts are arranged to be aligned along an intermediate transfer belt (an intermediate transferring member) 8 as an endless belt member. The intermediate transfer belt 8 functions as an image bearing member which bears transfer of a toner image.<br>
The image forming portions for respective colors have the photosensitive drums 2 (2a, 2b, 2c and 2d) as image bearing members. A charge roller 7 (7a, 7b, 7c or 7d) as a primary charge member, an exposure device 1 (la, lb, lc or Id), a developing device 3 (3a, 3b, 3c or 3d) constituting developing means, and a photosensitive drum cleaning blade 5 (5a, 5b, 5c or 5d) are arranged as means for forming a toner image around each photosensitive member 2.  A toner cartridge 6 (6a, 6b, 6c or 6d) of each color is accommodated in each development device 3.<br>
A primary transfer roller 4 (4a, 4b, 4c or 4d) covered with an elastic member such as foamed rubber on a surface thereof is in contact with a lower portion of each photosensitive drum 2 through the intermediate transfer belt 8, thereby forming a primary transfer portion which transfers a toner image formed on each photosensitive member 2 onto the intermediate transfer belt 8. Therefore, toner images of respective colors formed on the respective<br><br>
photosensitive members 2 are superposed in an order onto the intermediate transfer belt (the intermediate transferring member) 8 by the primary transfer rollers 4 in the respective primary transfer portion (the transfer process is called "primary transfer"). Further, the toner images superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt 8 are collectively transferred onto a recording material P by a secondary transfer roller 10 as a transferring member which is in contact with the intermediate transfer belt 8 to constitute a transfer region.  The recording material P is fed from a feeding cassette 20 one by one, and carried to regions α and β formed of the secondary roller 10 and the intermediate transfer belt 8 by a pre-secondary-transfer carriage roller 18 as a recording material carriage portion. During carriage of the recording material P, the recording material P is guided by a pre-transfer guide 17 as a guide member, and the recording material P is stably carried to the regions a and (3. This pre-transfer guide 17 guides a leading end of the recording material P to be come into contact with the secondary transfer roller 10 before entering the region α.  Furthermore, the recording material which has passed through the regions a and (3 is pressed and heated by a fixer 21, thereby fixing the transferred toner images on the recording material.  On the other<br><br>
hand, a toner remaining on the intermediate transfer belt 8 after secondary transfer is removed from the intermediate transfer belt 8 by a cleaning blade 11. The removed toner is supplied to and stored in a wasted toner container 14 by a wasted toner supply mechanism 12.<br>
Here, a description will be given as to dimensions or materials of main members constituting the secondary transfer portion, e.g., the intermediate transfer belt 8 or the secondary transfer roller 10.<br>
The intermediate transfer belt 8 is tensioned by a secondary transfer opposed roller 15, a tension roller 9 and a pre-secondary-transfer tension roller 13 as secondary transfer inside members.  The intermediate transfer belt 8 is an endless (seamless) single-layer resin belt having a thickness of 75 µm, a circumferential length of 1115 mm and a longitudinal length (an image forming width direction) of 310 rum.  An electric resistance of this intermediate transfer belt 8 is adjusted by dispersing carbon in a polyimide material which is a main material of the belt.  This intermediate<br>
transfer belt 8 has a volume resistivity of 109 Q'cm and a surface resistance of 10  Q/cm or above as a result of measurement using an ultra high resistance meter R8 34 0 (a registered trademark) manufactured by<br><br>
Advantest.  A method of measuring the volume resistivity of this intermediate transfer belt 8 was carried out based on Japanese Industrial Standards "Testing methods for thermosetting plastics (JIS-K6911)".  Measurement was performed with electroconductive rubber having a low resistance value being sandwiched between an electrode for measurement and a surface of the belt 8,  This configuration stabilizes contact properties between the electrode and the intermediate transfer belt 8. Moreover, measurement was conducted under conditions of 100 V as the volume resistivity of the intermediate transferring member belt 8 and 10 seconds as an application time.  It is to be noted that the same measurement value was obtained from measurement on both front and rear surfaces of the intermediate transfer belt 8.<br>
The secondary transfer opposed roller 15 is a roller which tensions the intermediate transfer belt 8 and has a function as an opposed roller of the secondary transfer roller 10 and a function as a driving roller.  Additionally, the secondary transfer opposed roller 15 is grounded so that a transfer electric field can be formed between itself and the secondary transfer roller 10.  The secondary transfer opposed roller 15 is obtained by coating a cored bar having a diameter .of 30 mm with ethylene-propylene-<br><br>
diene (EPDM) rubber whose resistance is adjusted by carbon black and which has a thickness of 500 µm.<br>
The tension roller 9 is an aluminum hollow tube having a diameter of 30 mm, has springs at bearing portions at both ends thereof, and tensions the belt with a total pressure of 40 N.  The pre-secondary-transfer tension roller 13 is a stainless roller having a diameter of 14 mm, and rotates in accordance with the intermediate transfer belt 8.<br>
The secondary transfer roller 10 is a roller constituting three layers with respect to a cored bar having a diameter of 12 mm.  FIG. 4 shows its cross section.  A cored bar 10a is coated with foamed hydrin rubber having a thickness of approximately 4 mm from the cored bar side in such a manner that an elastic member (an elastic layer 10b) has a diameter of 20 mm over 310 mm, and solid hydrin rubber having a thickness of approximately 1 mm is further superimposed thereon (a cover layer 10c). Furthermore, a surface of the layered structure is coated with urethane having powdery polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) of approximately 20 microns dispersed therein.  The surface of the secondary transfer roller 10 is smoothened by this layered structure and coating.  This surface of the secondary transfer roller 10 is so smooth that an edge of the recording material P can slide thereon even if the edge comes<br><br>
into contact with this surface.  When a surface nature of this secondary transfer roller 10 was measured in terms of a contact angle using pure water, the contact angle θ was 100°•  Even though the surface was contaminated due to duration, the contact angle of 60° or above was assured.  In a method of measuring the contact angle 9 of this secondary transfer roller 10, pure water of approximately 3 ml was dropped onto the surface of the secondary transfer roller, and the contact angle at a contact point of pure water and the secondary transfer roller was measured by using a microscope.  FIG. 3 shows a definition of the contact angle 9.  It is to be noted that a contact angle meter which is a CA-X type manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd. was used for measurement.  Moreover, a degree of hardness of the secondary transfer roller 10 is 35° in terms of Asker-C hardness in a state where a load of 500 g is applied.  It is preferable for the secondary transfer roller 10 to have the Asker-C hardness which is not greater than 45°.  That is because the regions a and (3 can be assuredly formed and stable carriage of the recording material P can be realized when this hardness is adopted.<br>
It is to be noted that a so-called actual resistance value of the secondary transfer roller 10 is 107Q.  In a method of measuring this resistance<br><br>
value, the value was obtained as a result of measurement using an ultra high resistance meter R8340 (a registered trademark) manufactured by Advantest while rotating the roller as a measurement target in accordance with an aluminum cylinder having a diameter of 30 mm.  Conditions of this measurement were 2 kV as an applied voltage, 30 seconds as an application time, 9.8 N as a contact pressure, and 190 mm/sec as a revolving circumferential velocity of the secondary transfer roller 10.<br>
A description will now be given as to a path along which the recording material P is carried to the regions a and (3.  The recording material P carried by the pre-transfer carriage roller 18 is guided by the pre-transfer guide 17, and a leading end of the recording material P is thereby first brought into contact with the secondary transfer roller 10.  Since the smoothness of the surface of the secondary transfer roller according to this embodiment is excellent as described above, the leading end of the recording material P is carried/guided to be slid on the surface of the secondary transfer roller 10, and then introduced into the first region a.  According to this configuration, the recording material P can enter the first region a without coming into contact with the intermediate transfer belt 8.  Additionally, the<br><br>
recording material P is carried to the second region (3 as a transfer nip portion while maintaining sufficient close contact properties with respect to the intermediate transfer belt 8 in the first region a as a nip portion immediately before transfer.<br>
It is to be noted that, when the smoothness of the secondary transfer roller surface is poor, a leading edge of the recording material P is readily caught by the secondary transfer roller 10, behaviors of the leading end of the recording material P are disordered by a resistance at the time of contact of the recording material P with the secondary transfer roller 10, and the leading end of the recording material P comes into contact with toner images on the intermediate transfer belt 8 to distort an image. Therefore, as described above, the smoothness of the surface of the secondary transfer roller was assured, and the recording material immediately after contact of the recording material leading end with the secondary transfer roller 10 was set to stably enter the. region a.<br>
As mentioned above, it is possible to suppress the leading end portion of the recording material P from coming into contact with the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt 8 by the above-described behaviors before the leading end of the recording material P enters the first region a.  This<br><br>
demonstrates an effect of restraining a given image deficit.  This image deficit is generated when the leading end of the recording material P removes the toner images borne on the intermediate transfer belt 8.  This is a phenomenon that the leading end portion of the recording material P comes into contact with the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt 8 to remove the toner image to be transferred before entering the nip region.  This phenomenon produces two image deficits, i.e., an image deficit caused by removal of the toner images and an image deficit caused when the leading end of the recording material P is stained with the toner.<br>
A mechanism of generation of the image deficits will now be described in more detail.  According to such an image forming apparatus as described in the related art, the recording material is configured to first come into contact with the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt at a predetermined position on the intermediate transfer belt.  In this configuration, the image deficit is generated depending on settings of carriage speed control over the recording material or an approach angle of the recording material with respect to the intermediate transfer belt.  This time, a description will be given as to an example where a position at which the recording material comes into contact with the<br><br>
intermediate transfer belt is shifted to an upstream side in a moving direction of the intermediate transfer belt as a comprehensible case.<br>
The fact that the recording material comes into contact with the intermediate transfer belt on the upstream side in the moving direction means that the recording material takes a detour from a path along which the recording material is essentially carried. When the recording material takes a detour to come into contact with the intermediate transfer belt, both the intermediate transfer belt and the recording material are moving, and hence the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt precede the recording material which has detoured.  Then, the leading end of the recording material comes into contact with a rear side of the intermediate transfer belt in the moving direction apart from a position at which the leading end of the recording material is essentially brought into contact with the intermediate transfer belt.  Further, when the leading end of the recording material moves to the transfer nip while being in . contact with the secondary transfer belt, the leading end of the recording material removes the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt in a process where the intermediate transfer belt and the recording material reach the transfer nip.  That is because a relative position of the recording material<br><br>
and the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt is set at a planned position and the roundabout path is eliminated when the transfer material reaches the transfer nip.  That is, the recording material is in contact with the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt in a shifted manner, but an attitude of the recording material is corrected and the shift is gradually eliminated in the movement process, and the leading end of the recording material removes the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt in this process.<br>
On the other hand, according to the image forming apparatus of this embodiment, since the leading end of the recording material P carried to be slid on the secondary transfer roller 10 is introduced into the region a without coming into contact with the intermediate transfer belt 8, the above-described image deficit is not produced.  In particular, an effect of this configuration remarkably appears when toner images are formed to reach an edge of the recording material (when formation of an image having a small leading end margin or formation of an image having no margin (which will be also referred to as a "borderless image" hereinafter) is transferred onto the recording material P).  That is because the toner images in the vicinity of the leading end of the recording material<br><br>
are not distorted in a transfer process.  In the image forming apparatus according to this embodiment, toner images can be finely formed to reach an edge of the recording material P.<br>
A carriage speed of the recording material P will now be described.  In regard to a carriage speed of the recording material P, assuming that a carriage speed of the recording material P in the region p is 100%, the carriage speed of the recording material P by the pre-secondary-transfer carriage roller 18 is set to 101%.  Based on this speed relationship, the following function can be demonstrated.  When a given recording material P exists in the regions a and β and nipped by the secondary transfer carriage roller 18, a loop of the recording material P is slightly formed between the regions a and β and the secondary transfer carriage roller 18.  Forming this loop can carry the recording material P which has entered the<br>
region a without being pulled by the pre-secondary-transfer carriage roller 18.  This means that the recording material P which has entered the region a is stably carried with movement of the intermediate transfer belt 8 in a carriage process and a deviation can be suppressed from being generated between the recording material P and a position of the intermediate transfer belt 8 in the carriage process. That is, toner images are hard to deviate on the<br><br>
recording material P and further stable transfer can be realized.<br>
Configurations of the regions a and (3 will now be described in detail.<br>
A secondary transfer voltage of approximately 2 kV is applied to the cored bar of the secondary transfer roller 10 from a non-illustrated secondary transfer bias power supply through feeder springs. Furthermore, a cored bar of the secondary transfer opposed roller 15 is grounded, and a transfer electric field is formed between the secondary transfer roller 10 and the secondary transfer opposed roller 15.  This transfer electric field is mainly formed in the region (3 shown in FIG. 1.  As depicted in FIG. lr the secondary transfer roller 10 is offset-arranged with respect to the secondary transfer opposed roller 15 on the upstream side in the belt moving direction.  Moreover, the pre-secondary-transfer tension roller 13 is arranged on the upstream side in the belt moving direction apart from both the rollers 10 and 15.  The arrangement of these rollers form the first region a and the second roller (3.  The second region p is a region where both the secondary transfer roller 10 and the secondary transfer opposed roller 15 are in contact with front and rear sides of the intermediate transfer belt 8. The first region a is a nip region where the<br><br>
recording material P is nipped and carried by the intermediate transfer belt 8 and the secondary transfer roller 10 from the upstream side in the belt moving direction apart from the second region β. Providing this region α before the region (3 can suppress "toner scattering" or a "defect of transferring" due to discharge and improve a transfer quality of toner images in this embodiment.  Since the intermediate transfer belt 8 and the recording material P are appressed against each other in the region α and the recording material P reaches the region (3 in the close contact state, the above-described "toner scattering" or "defect of transferring" can be suppressed, thereby maintaining a high image grade.<br>
If the leading end of the recording material P is introduced into the transfer nip portion without obtaining sufficient close contact properties between the recording material P and the intermediate transfer belt 8, the so-called "toner scattering" or "defect of transferring" due to discharge occurs* The configuration of this embodiment suppresses them.<br>
The "toner scattering" is a phenomenon that the toner in an image part (a part where the toner exists) of a toner image formed on the recording material P spreads.  For example, it is a phenomenon resulting in an image having a blurry line of a<br><br>
character or the like.<br>
A mechanism of this "toner scattering" will now be described-  When the leading end of the recording material P is introduced into the transfer nip portion without obtaining sufficient close contact properties between the recording material P and the intermediate transfer belt 8, a transfer electric field is generated between the recording material P and the intermediate transfer belt 8 in a state where a gap exists between the recording material P and the intermediate transfer belt 8.  The toner is going to move to the recording material P from the intermediate transfer belt 8 in accordance with the transfer electric field.  Then, since the gap exists between the intermediate transfer belt 8 and the recording material P, the toner scatters between these members, namely, the toner moves along a long distance which is the gap, thereby resulting in unstable movement of the toner.  Additionally, the toner has fixed electric charges, and there is a tendency that toners electrostatically repel each other.  Therefore, existence of the gap produces a phenomenon that the toner spreads in the transfer process.  This phenomenon leads to the "toner scattering".<br>
The "defect of transferring" due to discharge means an image deficit due to discharge, and often<br><br>
involves a so-called discharge pattern.  This pattern is apt to appear on a halftone image in particular.<br>
A mechanism of the "defect of transferring" will now be described hereinafter.  As described above, when the recording material P enters the transfer nip in a state where the intermediate transfer belt 8 and the recording material P are not appressed against each other, a transfer electric field is generated in the gap.  When the transfer electric field in this gap portion exceeds a Paschen's law, discharge occurs in the gap portion, and a charge polarity of the toner in the vicinity of the gap is reversed.  A polarity of the toner charged with a negative polarity is reversed to have a positive polarity.  Then, the toner with the reversed charge moves in a direction opposite to a direction along which the toner essentially moves by the transfer process, and hence the toner does not reach the recording material P.  Further, a part to which the toner does not move has no toner image, thus resulting in the "defect of transferring".  This is the mechanism of forming the "defect of transferring" due to discharge.<br>
According to the image forming apparatus of this embodiment, since the region α is provided and the recording material P reaches the region β in a state where the intermediate transfer belt 8 and the<br><br>
recording material P are appressed against each other, the above-described "toner scattering" and "defect of transferring" can be suppressed, thereby maintaining a high image grade.<br>
It is to be noted that there is the relationship that the carriage speed of the recording material P by the pre-secondary-transfer carriage roller 18 is higher than the carriage speed of the recording material P in the region β, and hence the recording material P which has reached the region α is carried without being pulled by the pre-secondary-transfer carriage roller 18.  Furthermore, movement of the recording material P at the time of transfer can be stabilized in the entire region of the recording material, and the close contact state of the recording material P and the intermediate transfer belt 8 can be maintained, thereby suppressing the "toner scattering" and the "defect of transferring" in the entire region of the recording material. <second embodiment><br>
An. image forming apparatus according to a second embodiment will now be described.  It is to be noted that an outline structure of the entire image forming apparatus is substantially the same as that in the foregoing embodiment, and hence a description will be given on a structure different from the first<br><br>
embodiment.  The structure having the elastic member consisting of the three-layered configuration on the cored bar as the secondary transfer roller formed of two or more layers has been described in the first embodiment, but a description will be given as to an example where the secondary transfer roller has a two-layered configuration in the second embodiment. A configuration and a material of the secondary transfer roller will now be described.<br>
The secondary transfer roller according to this embodiment has a two-layered configuration, and a layer other than a surface layer is an elastic member whose hardness is not greater than 45° in terms of the Asker-C hardness.  Specifically, in the secondary transfer layer having the two-layered configuration, a base layer is foamed rubber (the elastic member) consisting of blended rubber in which epichlorohydrin and acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) are blended, and a degree of hardness of the base layer portion (a degree of hardness of the base layer + a cored bar) is 30° in terms of the Asker-C hardness under a load of 500 g or below.<br>
Moreover, the surface layer is formed of a resin tube.  The foamed rubbcr is covered with the tube.  The resin tube forming the surface layer of this secondary transfer roller is a resin tube having a thickness of 70 \xm.      In this embodiment, as the<br><br>
resin tube forming the surface layer, a resin having high smoothness with respect to a recording material is selected.  Specifically, as the resin tube forming the surface layer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) subjected to resistance adjustment by carbon black is used.  However, the present invention is not restricted thereto.  For example, the resin tube may be a tube using other resins such as polyimide, polycarbonate, polyester, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
When the resin tube having high smoothness of the surface was used for coating in this manner, a contact angle (a contact angle of pure water) of the secondary transfer roller according to this embodiment on a roller surface thereof became 70°.<br>
The resin tube forming the surface layer of the secondary transfer roller covers the foamed rubber of the base layer in a compressively deformed state. The resin tube is fixed between the base layer and the surface layer by a fastening force.  If a deviation or the like occurs between the surface layer and the base layer, a bonding layer may be provided.<br>
In case of the secondary transfer roller in which the surface layer is covered with the resin tube, there is a fear that a degree of hardness of the roller surface becomes too high.  In case of<br><br>
using the secondary transfer roller, when a degree of hardness is too high, there is a problem that transfer properties or carriage properties of the recording material are not stabilized.  According to a result of an experiment conducted by the present inventor, it is desirable to set a degree of hardness of the secondary transfer roller to 45° or below in order to obtain a stable nip in a secondary transfer portion or stable recording material carriage properties.<br>
Thus, the present inventor set a thickness of the resin tube which covers the foamed rubber having the Asker-C hardness of 30° under a load of 500 g to 70 µm so that the Asker-C hardness of the secondary transfer roller become 37°.<br>
It is to be noted that a degree of hardness was measured in structures coated with PVDF resin tubes having different thicknesses.  When a thickness [µm] of each resin tube was set to 30, 70, 150 or 250, the Asker-C hardness as the entire roller was 34, 37, 45 or 49.<br>
As described above, selecting a resin having high smoothness of a surface for the resin tube of the surface layer can obtain the same effect as that in the first embodiment, thereby acquiring an excellent image. <third embodiment><br><br>
An image forming apparatus according to a third embodiment will now be described with reference to FIG. 5.  FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing a configuration around a secondary transfer portion. It is to be noted that an outline structure of the entire image forming apparatus is substantially the same as those of the foregoing embodiments, and hence a description will be given as to a configuration different from that in the first embodiment.<br>
The image forming apparatus according to this embodiment has a "borderless image forming mode" which is a mode of forming a toner image without a margin on a recording material P.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to this embodiment, a toner image which is 3 mm larger than a size of the recording material in front-to-back and left-to-right directions was formed on an intermediate transfer belt 8 in such a manner that the toner image can be formed to reach an edge of the recording material P even in a state where a. carriage timing of the recording material P is shifted. Therefore, a toner which cannot be transferred onto the recording material P from the intermediate transfer belt 8 at the time of secondary transfer and thereby runs off is directly transferred onto a secondary transfer roller 23.<br>
Thus, this embodiment has a transferring member<br><br>
cleaning member which removes the toner which has adhered to the secondary transfer roller 23. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 5, there is provided a cleaning blade 22 as the transferring member cleaning member which comes into contact with the secondary transfer roller 23 to remove the toner.  This cleaning blade 22 is formed of urethane rubber, and it is in contact with the secondary transfer roller 23 within a line pressure range of 20 to 100 g/cm. Further, the toner removed by the cleaning blade 22 is configured to be stored in a wasted toner container 19.<br>
It is to be noted that the secondary transfer roller 23 according to this embodiment is superior in smoothness like the secondary transfer roller 10 according to the first embodiment, and hence removal of the toner is easy.  Therefore, a surface of the secondary transfer roller 23 has high cleanability. In a production process of the secondary transfer roller 23, foaming is effected in a cylindrical container to shape an elastic layer.  At the time of shaping, a so-called a skin layer is eventually formed at a position where contact is made with respect to the cylindrical container, thereby obtaining a roller having a surface on which foamed cells do not appear.<br>
Furthermore, as a result of an experiment<br><br>
conducted by the present inventor, when a contact angle of the secondary transfer roller surface was maintained at 70° or above, stable cleaning with less adherence of water was realized even in a high-humidity environment.  That is because catching of the cleaning blade 22 and the secondary transfer roller 23 was able to be suppressed.<br>
Moreover, in this embodiment, average roughness Rz of the surface of the secondary transfer roller 23 on a scale of one to ten is set to 3 µm.  That is because setting Rz to be smaller than a toner particle diameter can more assuredly clean the toner. This prevents the toner from slipping through the cleaning blade 22 to be result in a cleaning defect.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, in case of recording an image having no margin on the recording material by forming the image larger than a size of the recording material on the intermediate transfer belt, the secondary transfer roller 23 can be cleaned, and the same effect as that in the first embodiment can be obtained.<br>
It is to be noted that the cleaning member of the secondary transfer roller 10 is the blade in this embodiment, but the present invention is not restricted thereto, and it is possible to adopt other physical cleaning members such as a brush or a web or electrostatic cleaning members which brings a<br><br>
cleaning roller or the like to which a bias power can be applied into contact with the secondary transfer roller to collect the toner.<br>
Although the four image forming portions are used in order to form a color image in the foregoing embodiments, the image forming portions to be used are not restricted to this number, and the number may be appropriately set as required.  Moreover, the present invention is not restricted to the color image forming apparatus, and it may be an image forming apparatus which forms a monochromatic image.<br>
Additionally, although the printer has been exemplified as the image forming apparatus in the foregoing embodiments, the present invention is not restricted thereto, it may be, e.g., other image forming apparatuses such as a copying machine or a facsimile device or other image forming apparatuses such as a complex machine in which functions of these devices are combined, and applying the present invention to the image forming apparatus can obtain the same effect.<br>
Further, although the various embodiments according to the present invention have been described, aims and scopes of the present invention are not restricted to specific descriptions and drawings in this specification.  For example, it is needless to say that the present invention can be<br><br>
applied to a case where transfer is directly performed onto a recording material from a photosensitive member.<br>
