				<td>TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel subtilase enzymes of the I-Sl  and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 96 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103. These proteases are useful exhibiting excellent or improved wash performance when used in detergents; "cleaning and detergent compositions. The invention further relates to genes coding for the expression of said enzymes when inserted into a suitable host cell or organism; and such host cells transformed therewith and capable of expressing said enzyme variants, and methods for producing the novel enzymes.<br>
BACKGROUKD OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM" (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE" (Novo Nordisk A/S), MAXAPEM" (Gist-Brocades N.V.), PURAFECT" (Genencor International, Inc.).<br>
Further a number of protease variants are described in the art, such as in EP 130756 (GENENTECH)(corresponding to US Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR));  EP 214435 (HENKEL); WO 87/04461 (ANGEN); WO 87/05050 (GENEX); EP 260105 (GENENCOR); Thomas, Russell, and Fersht (1985) Nature 318 375-376; Thomas,<br><br>
Russell,   and   Fersht    (1987)    J.   Mol.   Biol-   193   803-813;   Russel   and Fersht   Nature  328   496-500    (1987) ;   WO   88/08028    (Genex) ;   WO 88/08033    (Amgen);   WO   95/27049    (SOLVAY   S.A.);   WO   95/30011<br>
(PROCTER   &amp;  GAMBLE   COMPANY) ;   WO   95/30010    (PROCTER   Sc   GAMBLE COMPANY);   WO   95/29979    {PROCTER   &amp;   GAMBLE   COMPANY);    US   5.543.302<br>
(SOLVAY   S.A.);    EP   251   446    {QENENCOR) ;   WO   89/06279    (NOVO  NORDISK A/S} ;   WO   91/00345    (NOVO   NORDISK  A/S) ;    EP   525   610   Al    (SOLVAY); and  WO   94/02618    (GIST-BROCADES  N.V.).<br>
However,   even  chough a  number of   useful   protease  variants have  been described,   there  is still   a  need   for  new  improved proteases   or protease   variants   for   a   number   of   industrial   uses.<br>
Therefore,   an object  of   the  present   invention,   is  to provide  improved proteases  or protein  engineered protease variants,   especially for use   in  the   detergent   industry.<br>
StJMMARY   OF   THE   IMVEMTION<br>
The  present  inventors have   found  that   subtilisins  wherein at   least  one of  the  active  site   loops   are   longer  than those presently known,   exhibit   improved  wash performance  properties   in detergent  compositions.   The  identification  thereof  was done  in constructing  subtilisin variants,   especially  of   the  subtilisin 309   (BLSAVI  or SavinaseÂ®) ,   exhibiting  improved wash performance properties   in detergent   compositions  relative   to  the parent:  wild type  enzyme.   This  has been described  in  our earlier application DK1332/97.<br>
It  has  now been  found  that   certain  subtilases or variants thereof  of  the  I-Sl   (true   " subtilisins"  )   and   I-S2   (high alkaline  subtilisins)   sub-groups  having  at   least   one  additional amino  acid  residue   in position   96   (or  rather  between positions 96   and  97)   of   the  active   site  loop   (b)   region  from position  95 to  103,   exhibit  surprisingly improved wash performance  in<br><br>
comparison to those presently known and those described in said application.<br>
The improved proteases according to the invention may be obtained by isolation from natural resources or by the introduction of at least one further amino acid residue (an insertion) in the active site loop (b) between positions 96 and 97 in a wild type subtilase (for a definition of the active site loops and the numbering of positions see below) .<br>
Although this finding was done in subtilisin 309 it is predicted that it will be possible to produce or isolate similar advantageous subtilases or subtilase variants.<br>
Furthermore it will be possible to specifically screen natural isolates to identify novel wild type subtilases comprising an active site loop (b) which is longer than the corresponding active site loop in known wild type subtilases, such as subtilisin 309, which subtilases can be considered to have an inserted amino acid residue between positions 96 and 97^ and exhibiting excellent wash performance in a detergent, in comparison to their closest related known subtilisin, such as subtilisin 309.<br>
Concerning alignment and numbering reference is made to Figs. 1, la, 2 and 2a below showing alignments between subtilisin BPK" (BASBPN) (a) and subtilisin 309 (Blair (b) , and alignments between subtilisin BPN" (a) (BASBPN) and subtilisin Carlsberg (g) . In Figs. 1 and 2 the alignments were established by the use of the GAP routine of the GCG package as indicated below, whereas the alignments of Figs, la and  2a are the same as shown in WO 91/00345. These alignments are in this patent application used as a reference for numbering the residues.<br>
The seven active site loops (a) to (g) (including both the end amino acid residues indicated) are here defined to encompass the amino acid residues in the segments given below<br><br>
(a)	the	region between amino acid residue 33 and 43;<br>
(b)	the	region between amino acid residue 95 and 103;<br>
(c)	the	region between amino acid residue 125 and 132<br>
(d)	the	region between amino acid residue 153 and 173<br>
(e)	the	region between amino acid residue 181 and 195<br>
(f)	the	region between amino acid residue 202 and 204<br>
(g)	the	region between amino acid residue 218 and 219<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention relates to an isolated (i.e. greater than 10 % pure) subtilase enzymes of the I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 96 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino acid residue (s) correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 96 and 97.<br>
In a second aspect the invention relates to an isolated DNA sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to an expression vector comprising an isolated DNA sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention relates to a microbial host cell transformed with an expression vector according to the fourth aspect.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to the producÂ¬tion of the subtilisin enzymes of the invention.<br>
The enzymes of the invention can generally be produced by either cultivation of a microbial strain from which Chem. enzyme was isolated and recovering the enzyme in substantially pure form; or by inserting an expression vector according to the fourth aspect of the invention into a suitable microbial host,<br><br>
cultivating the host to express the desired subtilase enzyme, and recovering the enzyme product.<br>
Further the invention relates to a composition comprising a subtilase or subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
Even further the invention relates to the use of the enzymes of the invention for a number of industrial relevant uses, in particular for use in cleaning  compositions and cleaning compositions comprising the mutant enzymes, especially detergent compositions comprising the mutant subtilisin enzymes.<br>

NOMENCLATURE AND CONVENTIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF VARIANTS<br><br>
In describing the various enzyme variants produced or counterplotted according to the invention, the following nomenÂ¬clatures and conventions have been adapted for ease of reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent wild type enzyme with subtilisin BPR" (BASBPN).<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 to number the variants using the following parameters: gap creation penalty = 6 and gap extension penalty = 8 and all other parameters kept at their default values.<br>
Another method is to use known recognised alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Such alignments between subtilisin BPN" (BASBPN) and subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI) and subtilisin Carlsberg (BLSCAR) , respectively are indicated in Figs. 1, la, 2, and 2a. By this a number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation to BASBPK. In Fig. 1 subcilisin 309 has 6 deletions in positions 36, 58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN, whereas in Fig. la subtilisin 309 has the same deletions in positions 36, 56, 159, 164, 165, and 166 in comparison to SASBPN. In Fig. 2 subtilisin Carlsberg has one deletion in position 53 in comparison to BASBPN, whereas in Fig. 2a subtilisin Carlsberg has the one deletion in position 56 in comparison to BASBPN. These deletions are in Figs. 1, la, 2, and 2a indicated by apteryxes (*).<br>
The various modifications performed in a wild type enzyme is indicated in general using three elements as follows:<br><br>
Original amino acid position substituted amino acid<br>
The notation G195E thus means a substitution of a glycine in position 195 with a glutamic acid.<br>
In the case when the original amino acid residue   be any amino acid residue, a short hand notation may at times be used indicating only the position and substituted amino acid,<br>
Position substituted amino acid<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connecting winch modification(s) in homologous subtilases (vide   infra).<br>
Similarly when the identity of the substituting amino acid residue(s) is immaterial,<br>
Original amino acid position<br>
When both the original amino acid[s) and substituted amino acid(s) may comprise any amino acid, then only the position is indicated, e.g.:     170.<br>
When the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid{s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), then the selected amino acids are indicated inside brackets { ) ,<br>
Original amino acid position {substituted amino acid^, . - . , substituted amino acid-n)<br>
For specific variants the specific three or one letter codes are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate any amino acid residue.<br>
SUBSTITUTIONS:<br><br>
The substitution of Glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Glu   or   G195E or the substitution of any amino acid residue acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Xaa   or   G195X or<br>
Glyl95      or   G195<br>
The substitution of serine for any amino acid residue in position 170 would thus be designated<br>
Xaal70Ser   or   X170S. or<br>
170Ser      or   170S<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification (s) in homologous subtilases (vide  infra).   170Ser is thus meant   to  comprise  e.g.   both a  Lysl70Ser modification in EASBPN and Argl70Ser modification in BLSAVI (of. Fig. 1).<br>
For a modification where the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), the substitution of glycine, alanine, serine or threonine for arginine in position 170 would be indicated by<br>
ArgX70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}    or R170(G,A,S,T} to indicate the variants<br>
R170G, R170A, R170S, and R170T.<br>
DELETIONS:<br>
A deletion of glycine  in position  195  will  be  indicated by:<br>
Glyl95*	or       G195*<br><br>
Correspondingly the deletion of more than one amino acid residue, such as the deletion of glycine and leucine in positions 195 and 196 will be designated<br>
Glyl95*+Leul96*  or   Gl95*+Ll96*<br>
INSERTIONS:<br>
The insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as e.g.   a lysine after G195 is :<br>
Glyl95GlyLys     or   G195GK; or when more than one amino acid residue is inserted, such as e.g. a Lys, Ala and Ser after G195 this is :<br>
Glyl95GlyLysAlaSer    or   G195GKAS<br>
In such cases the inserted amino acid residue (s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue (s). In the above example the sequences 194 to 196 would thus be;<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
194 195 195a 195b 195c 196 Variant     A-G-K-  A-  S-  L<br>
In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted it is clear that a degeneracy in the nomenclature arises. If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G195GG. The same actual change could just as well be indicated as A194AG for the change from<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br><br>
194 195  195a 196 "ariant     A - G -  G -  L<br>
194 194a 195  196<br>
Such instances will be apparent to the skilled person, ind the indication G195GG and corresponding indications for this :ype of insertions are thus meant to comprise such equivalent iegenerate indications.<br>
FILLING A GAP:<br>
Where  a  deletion  in  an  enzyme  exists   in  the  reference comparison with the  subtilisin  EPN"   sequence  used  for the numbering,   an  insertion  in  such a position  is   indicated as:<br>
*36Asp	or        *36D<br>
for the  insertion of  an  aspartic acid  in position  36<br>
MULTIPLE   MODIFICATIONS<br>
Variants  comprising multiple modifications   are  separated by pluses,   e.g. :<br>
Argl70Tyr+Glyl95Glu        or       P.170Y+G195E representing modifications   in positions   170  and  195   substituting tyrosine   and glutamic  acid  for  arginine  and glycine,   respecÂ¬tively .<br>
or   e.cr.   Tyrl67 JGly, Ala, Ser ,Thr}+Argl70 JGly, Ala, Ser,Thr} designates   the variants<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl57Gly+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl6 7Ala+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl7 0Ser,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Thr,<br><br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl?0Gly,       Tyrl6 7Thr+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ser,   and Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Thr. This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to modifications aimed at substituting, replacing, inserting or deleting amino acid residues having specific common properties, such as residues of positive charge (K, R,"H), negative charge (D, E) , or conservative amino acid modification (s) of e.g. Tyrl67(Gly, Ala,Ser, Thr)-(-Argl 70 {Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr) , which signifies substituting a small amino acid for another small amino acid. See section "Detailed description of the invention" for further details.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms.   W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3).<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br>
If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to that of the subtilase BPN" (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN" sequence see Figs. 1 and 2, or Siezen et  al. ,   Protein  Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Principles  of Biochemistry,"   Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272).<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by<br><br>
diisopropylfluorophosphate- They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 {for review, see Priest {1977) Bacteriological     Rev.   41 711-753) .<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated "subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et al. ,   Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein   Science  6 (1997) 501-523. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al.   now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et al.{1997).<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I-Si or " true# subtilisins, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168), subtilisin BPN", subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCALASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S) , and subtilisin DY {BSSDY) .<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognised by Siezen ec al.   {supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL", Gist-Brocades NV) , subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE", NOVO NORDISK A/S), subtilisin 147 [BLS147)  (ESPERASE", NOVO NORDISK A/S) , and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB) .<br><br>

""SAVINASEÂ®"<br>
SAVINASEÂ® is marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S. It is subtilisin 309 from B. Lentus and differs from BAALKP only in one position (N87S, see Fig. 1 herein). SAVINASEÂ® has the amino acid sequence designated b) in Fig. 1.<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term ""parent subtilase" describes a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al. (1991 and 1997). For further details see description of "SUBTILASES" immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modification have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Alternatively the term "parent subtilase" may be termed "wild type subtilase".<br><br>
Modification(s) of a subtilase variant<br>
The term ""modification(s) " used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding a subtilase. The modification(s&gt; can be replacement(s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s), deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
Specific active site loop regions, and amino acid insertions in said loops of SAVINASEÂ® subtilase are identified for modification herein to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to modifications of this particular subtilase, but extend to other parent (wild-type) subtilases, which have a homologous primary structure to that of SAVINASEÂ®. The homology between two amino acid sequences is in this context described by the parameter "identity".<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subtilases the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 can be applied (infra) using the same settings. The output from the<br><br>
routine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between the two sequences.<br>
Based on  this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous subtilases and corresponding homologous active site loop regions, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Wash performance<br>
The ability of an enzyme to catalyze the degradation of various naturally occurring substrates present on the objects to be cleaned  during  e.g.   wash or hard surface cleaning is often referred to as its washing ability, wash-ability, detergency, or wash performance. Throughout this application the term wash performance will be used to encompass this property.<br>
Isolated DNA sequence<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a DNA sequence molecule, denotes that the DNA sequence has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of  other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones. Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5" and 3" untranslated regions such as  promoters and terminators. The identificacion of associated regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 11^:774-78, 1985) . The term "an isolated DNA sequence" may alternatively be termed ""a cloned DNA sequence".<br><br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein has been removed from its native environment.<br>
In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. ""homologous impurities" (see below}).<br>
An isolated protein is greater than 10 % pure, preferably greater than 20 % pure, more preferably greater than 30 % pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Further it is preferred to provide I the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 40% pure, greater than 60% pure, greater than 80% pure, more preferably greater than 95% pure, and even more preferably greater than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The tejrm "homologous impurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the polypeptide of the invention) f which originate from the homologous cell where the polypeptide of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
Obtained from<br>
The term "obtained from" as used herein in connection j with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br><br>
Substrate<br>
The term "Substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease is should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Product<br>
The term "product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should in the context of this invention be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subtilases of the invention in a first aspect relates to an isolated (i.e. greater than 10 % pure) subtilase enzyme of the I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 96 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino<br><br>
acid residue(s) correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 95 and 97.<br>
In other words the subtilases of the invention are characterized by comprising an active site loop (b) region of more than 9 amino acid residue and wherein the additional amino acid residue is or can be considered as being inserted between positions 96 and 97 as compared to the parent or a known wild type subtilase.<br>
A  subtilase of the first aspect of the invention may be a parent or wildtype subtilase identified and isolated from nature.<br>
Such a parent wildtype subtilase may be specifidally screened for by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
One preferred way of doing this may be by specifically PCR amplify DNA regions known to encode active site loops in subtilases from numerous different microorganism, prefei"ably different Bacillus strains.<br>
Subtilases are a group of conserved enzymes, in the sense that their DNA and amino acid sequences are homologous. Accordingly it is possible to construct relatively specific primers flanking active site loops.<br>
One way of doing this is by investigating an alignment of different subtilases (see e.g. Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 {1997) 501-523). It is from this routine work for a person skilled in the art to construct PCR primers flanking the active site loop corresponding to the active site loop (b) between amino acid residue 95 to 103 in any of the group I-Sl or" I-S2 groups, such as from BLSAVI. Using such PCR primers to amplify DNA from a number of different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains, followed by DNA sequencing of said amplified PCR fragments, it will be possible to identify strains which produce subtilases of these groups comprising a longer, as<br><br>
compared to e.g.   BLSAVI, active site region corresponding no the active site loop region from positions 95 to 103, and where an insertion can be considered to exist between positions 96 and 97. Having identified the strain and a partial DNA sequence of such a subtilase of interest, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to complete cloning, expression and purification of such a subtilase of the invention.<br>
However, it is envisaged that a subtilase enzyme of the invention predominantly is a variant of a parent subtilase.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention relates to an isolated subtilase enzyme according to the first aspect of the invention, wherein said subtilase enzyme is a constructed variant having a longer active site loop (b) than its parent enzyme by having at least one amino acid insertion between amino<br>
r  acid residues 96 and 97.<br>
The subtilases of the invention exhibit excellent wash performance in a detergent, and if the enzyme is a constructed variant an improved wash performance in a detergent in comparison to its closest related subtilase, such as subtilisin<br>
I 309.<br>
Different subtilase products will exhibit a different wash performance in different types of detergent compositions. A subtilase of the invention has improved wash performance, as compared to its closest relative in a majority of such different<br>
â  types of detergent compositions.<br>
Preferably a subtilase enzyme of the invention has improved wash performance, as compared to its closest relative in the detergent composition shown in Example 3 herein (vide infra).<br>
In order to determine if a given subtilase amino acid sequence (irrelevant whether said subtilase sequence is a parent wildtype subtilase sequence or a subtilase variant sequence<br><br>
produced by any other method than by site directed mutagenesis} is within the scope of the invention, the following procedure may be used:<br>
i)   align said subtilase sequence to the amino acid sequence of subtilisin BPN" (see section "Definitions" herein (vide supra); ii)  based on the alignment performed in step i) identify the active site loop (b) , in said subtilase sequence corresponding to the active site loop {b} region of subtilisin BPN" comprising the region [both of the end amino acids included) between amino acid residue from 95 to 103; iii) determine if the active site loop (b) in said subtilase sequence, identified in step ii) is longer than the corresponding active site loop in BLSAVI and if said prolongation corresponds to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 96 and 97. If this is the case the subtilase investigated is a subtilase within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The alignment performed in step i) above is performed as described above by using the GAP routine.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify the active site loop (b) in a subtilase and determine if the subtilase in question is within the scope of the invention. If a variant is constructed by site directed mutagenesis, it is of course known beforehand if the subtilase variant is within the scope of the invention.<br>
A subtilase variant of the invention may be constructed by standard techniques known in the art such as by site-directed/random mutagenesis or by DNA shuffling of different subtilase sequences. See section "PRODUCING A SUBTILASE<br><br>
VARIANT" and Material and methods herein (vide infra) for<br>

I        It is well known in the art that a sccalled conservative substitution of one amino acid residue to a similar amino acid residue is expected to produce only a minor change in the characteristic of the enzyme.<br>

Based on the disclosed and/or exemplified subtilase variants herein, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable conservative modification(s) to these variants in order to obtain other subtilase variants exhibiting similarly improved wash-performance.<br>
According to the invention it the subtilases of the invention belong to the subgroups I-Sl and I-S2, especially<br><br>
subgroup I-S2, both for isolating novel enzymes of the invention from nature or from the artificial creation of diversity, and for designing and producing variants from a parent subtilase.<br>

In particular said parent subtilase is BLSAVI {SAVINASEÂ® NOVO NORDISK A/S), and a preferred subtilase variant of the inÂ¬vention is accordingly a variant of SAVINASEÂ®.<br>
The present invention also comprises any of the above mentioned subtilases of the invention in combination with any other modification to the amino acid sequence thereof. EspecialÂ¬ly combinations with other modifications known in the art to provide improved properties to the enzyme are envisaged. The art describe a number of subtilase variants with different improved properties and a number of those are mentioned in the "BackÂ¬ground of the invention" section herein {vide  supra).   Those references are disclosed here as references to identify a subtilase variant, which advantageously can be combined with a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
Such combinations comprise the positions: 222 (improve oxidation stability}, 218 (improves thermal stability), substiÂ¬tutions in the Ca-binding sites stabilizing the enzyme, e.g. poÂ¬sition 76, and many other apparent from the prior art.<br><br>

Any of those modification(s) are expected to provide a higher expression level of a subtilase variant of the invention in the production thereof.<br>
Accordingly, an even further embodiment of the invention relates to a variant according to the invention, wherein said nodification is chosen from the group comprising:<br>
PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase of the invention and Jor introducing insertions into genes {e.g.   subtilase genes) are<br><br>
well   known   in   the   art,    cf.    che   references   cited   in   the   "BACKÂ¬GROUND OF  THE   INVENTION"    section.<br>
In  general  standard procedures   for cloning of genes  and introducing  insertions   (random  and/or  site directed)   into  said<br>
i genes  may be   used  in order  to  obtain  a  subtilase  variant  of  the invention.   For  further  description  of  suitable   techniques  referÂ¬ence  is made  to  Examples  herein   {vide  infra)   and   (Sambrook et al.    (1989)   Molecular  cloning:   A  laboratory manual,   Cold  Spring Harbor  lab..   Cold  Spring Harbor,   NY;   Ausubel,   F.   M.   et  al.<br>
)   (eds.)    "Current   protocols   in  Molecular  Biology".    John Wiley  and Sons,    1995;   Harwood,   C.   R.,    and   Cutting,   S.   M.    (eds.)    "Molecular Biological   Methods   for   Bacillus".   John  Wiley   and   Sons,    1990); and WO   96/34946.<br>
Further  a  subtilase  variant  of  the  invention may be constructed  by  standard  techniques   for artificial   creation of diversity,   such  as  by DNA  shuffling  of  different   subtilase genes (WO   95/22625;   Stemmer WPC,   Nature   370:389-91    (1994)).   DNA shuffling  of   e.g.   the  gene  encoding  SavinaseÂ® with one  or more partial   subtilase  sequences   identified  in nature   to comprise  an active  sice   (b)   loop  regions   longer  than the  active  site   jb) loop of  SavinaseÂ®,   will  after  subsequent  screening  for  improved wash performance  variants,   provide   subtilase  variants  according to  the  invention.<br>
EXPRESSION  VECTORS<br>
A recombinant  expression  vector  comprising  a DNA construct  encoding  the  enzyme of   the   invention may be any vecror which may  conveniently be   subjected  to  recombinant  DNA proÂ¬cedures .<br>
The   choice  of  vector  will   often depend on  the host  cell into which  it   is   to be  introduced.   Thus,   the vector may be an autonomously  replicating vector,   i.e.   a vector which exists  as<br><br>
an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is indepenÂ¬dent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety<br>
rand replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and<br>
5 proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
I        Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus  stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus  licheniformis  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus  awyloliguefaciens  alpha-amylase gene,<br>
the Bacillus  subtilis  alkaline protease gen, or the Bacillus<br>
f pumilus  xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda P^ or P^ promoters<br>
or the E. coli lac, trp or tac promoters.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br><br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g.   a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance co e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5" to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that<br>
5 normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminÂ¬ator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to<br>
) assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (of., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.).<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its<br><br>
natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus,   such as strains of B.   subtilis,   B.   licheniformis,   B.   lentus,   B.   brevis,   B. stearothermophilus,   B.   alkalopbilus,   B.   amyloliquefaciens,   B. coagulans,   B.   circulans,   B.   lautus,   B.   megatherium  or B. thuringiensis,   or strains of Streptowyces,   such as S.   lividans or S.   murinus,   or gram-negative bacteria such as Echerichia coli.<br>
The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation, conjugation, or by using competent cells in a manner known per se (cf. Sambrook et al., supra) .<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E.   coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insolÂ¬uble granules (known as inclusion bodies}, or may be directed to the-periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells,<br><br>
e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a subtilase enzymes of the I-S1 and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 96 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino acid residue(sj correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 96 and 97.<br><br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING SUBTILASE<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell, which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the<br>
production of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered<br>
I<br>
j from the culture.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the en2yTne of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating<br><br>
proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>
USE OF A SUBTILASE VARIANT OF THE INVENTION<br>
A subtilase protease variant of the invention may be used for a number of industrial applications, in particular within the detergent industry.<br>
Further the invention relates to an enzyme composition, which comprise a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
An summary of preferred industrial applications and corresponding preferred enzyme compositions are described below.<br>
This summary is not in any way intended to be a complete list of suitable applications of a subtilase variant of the invention. A subtilase variants of the invention may be used in other industrial applications known in the art to include use of a protease, in particular a subtilase.<br>

PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU) . The activity is<br>
determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASEÂ®) , and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein (DMC) solution by the proceolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50Â°C, pH 9.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity which, under standard conditions, during a 15 minutes" incubation at 40Â°C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces 5 an amount of NH^-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glycine.<br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitro-phenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith, L.A. , (1988) .<br>
FERMENTATION:<br>
Fermentations for the production of subtilase enzymes were performed at 30Â°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in SCO ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml BPX medium for 5 days.<br>
Consequently in order to make an e.g.   2   liter broth 20 Erlenmeyer flas)cs were fermented simultaneously.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
CONSTRUCTION AND EXPRESSION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS:<br>
Subtilase 309 site-directed variants of the invention comprising specific insertions in the active site loop (b) between positions 96 and 97 were made by traditional cloning of DNA fragments (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, 1989} produced by PCR of oligos containing the desired insertions (see below).<br>
The template plasmid DNA was pJS3, or an analogue of this containing a variant of Subtilase 3 09._<br>
Insertions were introduced by oligo directed mutagenesis to the construction of  L96LX insertion variants (X = any amino acid residue inserted between positions 96 and 97) resulting in L96LX subtilase 309 variants.<br>
The Subtilase 309 variants were transformed into E.   coli. DNA purified from a over night culture of these transformants were transformed into B,   subtilis  by<br>
restriction endonuclease digestion, purification of DNA fragments, ligation, transformation of B. subtilis.<br><br>
Transformation of B. subcilis was performed as described by Dubnau et al. , 1971, J. Mol. Biol. 56, pp. 209-221.<br>
LOCALIZED RANDOM MUTAGENESIS IN ORDER TO INSERT RANDOM INSERTIONS IN A LOCALIZED REGION:<br>
The overall strategy used to perform localized random mutagenesis was:<br>
a mutagenic primer (oligonucleotide) was synthesized corresponding to the DNA sequence flanking the site of insertion, separated by the DMA base pairs defining the insertion.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primer was used in a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer. The resulting PCR fragment was purified and extended in a second PCR-reaction, before being digested by endonucleases and cloned into the E. coli   -   B,   subtilis  shuttle vector (see below).<br>
Alternatively, and if necessary, the resulting PCR fragment is used in a second PCR reaction as a primer with a second suitable opposite primer to allow digestion and cloning of the mutagenized region into the shuttle vector. The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions.<br>
Following this strategy a localized random library was constructed in SAVINASE wherein insertions were introduced in the active site loop region between positions 96 and 97.<br>
The mutations were introduced by mutagenic primers (see below), so that all 20 amino acids are represented (N = 25% of A, T, C, and G; whereas S = 50% C and G. The produced PCR fragment were extended towards the N-terminal of Savinase by another round of PCR by combination of a overlapping sequence with a PCR-fragment produced by PCR-amplification with primers,-5" CTA AAT ATT CGT GGTGGC GC 3" (sense) and 5" GAC TTT AAC AGC GTA TAG CTC AGC 3" iantisense) .   The extended DNA-fragments were<br><br>
cloned into the Hind III- and Mlu I- sites of the modified plasmid pJS3 (see above), and ten randomly chosen Â£. coli colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations designed._<br>
The mutagenic primer (5" GCT GAG CTA TAC GGT GTT AAA GTC r CTA NNS GGG GCG AGC GGT TCA GGT TC 3" {sense})   were used in a PCR reaction with a suitable anti-sense opposite primer, situated downstream of the Mlu I site in pJS3 (e.g.   5"- CCC TTT AAC CGC ACA GCG TTT -3" Isnti-sense) )   and the plasmid pJS3 as template. This resulting PCR product was cloned into the pJS3 shuttle vector by using the restriction enzymes Hind III and Mlu I .<br>
The random library was transformed into E.   coli  by well known techniques.<br>
The library prepared contained approximately 100,000 individual clones/library.<br>
Ten randomly chosen colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations designed.<br>
In order to purify a subtilase variant of the invention, the B.   subtilis  pJS3 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the invention was transformed into a competent B.   subtilis I strain and was fermented as described above in a medium containing 10 [ig/ml Chloramphenicol (CAM) .<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 liter scale fermentation for the production of the subtilases of the invention in a Bacillus  host cell.<br>
Approximately 1.6 liters of fermentation broth were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 liter beakers. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra SlOO filter plates.<br><br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SIYIO UF cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin affinity /column at pH 7. The protease was eluted from the Bacitracin column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with O.OI dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protepise was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147} .<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column were combined and conÂ¬centrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
By using the techniques of Example 1 for Che construction<br>
and fermentation, and the above isolation procedure the<br>
following subtilisin 309 variants were produced and isolated;<br>
