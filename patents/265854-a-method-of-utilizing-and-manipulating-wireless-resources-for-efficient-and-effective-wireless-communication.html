BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which ate illustrated in fee accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the<br>
same or like parts.<br>
An orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital multi-carrier<br>
modulation scheme, which uses a large number of closely-spaced orthogonal sub-carriers.<br>
Each sub-carrier is usually modulated with a modulation scheme (e.g., quadrature plxase<br>
shift keying (QPSK)) at a low symbol rate while maintaining data rates similar to<br>
conventional single-carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.<br>
The OFDM originally does not have frequency diversity effect, but it can obtain<br>
frequency diversity effect by use of forward error correction (FEC) even in a distributed<br>
mode. That is, the frequency diversity effect becomes low when the chapel coding rate is<br>
high.<br>
in view of this, multi-carrier code division multiplexing (MC-CDM) or a multi-<br>
carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) with advanced receiver can be used to<br>
compensate for low frequency diversity effect due to high channel coding rate.<br><br>
The MC-CDM or MC-CDMA is a multiple access scheme used in OFDM-based<br>
system, allowing the system to support multiple users at the same time. In other words, the<br>
data can. be spread over a much wider bandwidth, than the data rate, a signal-to-noise and<br>
interference ratio can be minimized.<br>
For example, with respect to signal processing, a channel response for each OFDM<br>
tone (or signal or sub-carrier) can be modeled as identical independent complex Gaussian<br>
variable. By doing so and using MC-CDM, diversity gain and processing gain can be<br>
attained. Here, interference, such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) or multiples access<br>
interference (MAI), is temporarily omitted in part due to the cyclic prefix or zero padding<br>
employed by OFDM or MC-CDM.<br>
Figure 1 is an exemplary diagram of a generalized MC-CDM structure. Referring to<br>
Figure denotes the frequency response of fading channel, where \ is a<br>
complex Gaussian variable for the frequency-domain channel response of each sub-carrier.<br>
Furthermore, without loss of the generality, denote the unitary symbol<br>
precoding matrix with, power constraint |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. It can be taken a generalization of<br>
the classic MC-CDM.<br>
The processes of Figure 1 include channel coding followed by spreading and<br>
multiplexing (which can be represented by U). Thereafter, the multiplexed data is<br>
modulated by using the OFDM modulation scheme.<br><br>
At the receiving end, the OFDM modulated symbols are demodulated using OFDM<br>
demodulation scheme. They are then despread and detected, followed by channel decoding.<br>
Further to the generalized MC-CDM structure, other structures are available such as<br>
rotated MC-CDM, OFDM, rotational OFDM (R-OFDM), or Walsh-Hadamard MC-CDM.<br>
With respect to rotated MC-CDM, if α - cos(θ, ) and β = sin(θ ), then a real-<br>
value rotation matrix can be available as follows in Equation 1.<br><br>
Furthermore, with respect to OFDM, if αβ = 0 or αβ*=0, then U2 becomes I2.<br>
In other words, U7 becomes uncoded OFDM or uncoded OFDMA. In addition, with respect<br>
to Walsh-Hadamard MC-CDM, if α = cos(/4) = √2/2 and β = sin(/4) = √2/2, U2 = R2 become<br>
a classic "Walsh-Hadamard matrix.<br>
i	Figure 2 is another exemplary diagram of a generalized MC-CDM structure. In<br>
Figure 2, a plurality of data are inputted which are then precoded and/or rotated. Here, the<br>
precoding or rotation also can signify adjustment of the amplitude and/or phase of incoming<br>
data.<br><br>
With respect to precoding/rotation, different tones or sub-carriers may be<br>
precoded/rotated independently or jointly. Here, the joint precoding/rotation of the<br>
incoming data or data streams can be performed by using a single rotation matrix.<br>
Alternatively, different incoming data or data streams can be separated into multiple groups,<br>
where each group of data streams can be precoded/rotated independently or jointly.<br>
Figure 3 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a generalized MC-CDM structure in<br>
which precoding/rotation is performed on groups. Referring to Figure 3, multiple data or<br>
data streams are grouped into Data Stream(s) I, 2,..., K groups which, axe then<br>
precoded/rotated per group. Here, the precoding/rotation can include amplitude and/or<br>
phase adjustment, if necessary. Thereafter, the precoded/rotated symbols are mapped.<br>
Further, different rotation/precoding on different groups may lead to a mixture of<br>
OFDM, MC-CDM or R-OFDM. In addition, the rotation/precoding of each group may be<br>
based on the QoS requirement, the receiver profile, and/or the channel condition.<br>
Alternatively, instead of using a big precoding/rotation matrix, a smaller-sized<br>
precoding/rotation matrix can be dependency or independently applied to different'groups<br>
of incoming data streams.<br>
In operation, actual precoding/rotation operation can be performed in multiple stages.<br>
Figure 4 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a multi-stage rotation. Referring to Figure 4,<br>
multiple data or data streams are inputted which are then precoded/rotated. Here, these<br><br>
processed symbols can be grouped into at least two groups. Each group is represented by at<br>
least one symbol.<br>
With respect to rotation of the symbols, tile symbol(s) of each group can be spread<br>
using a spreading matrix. Here, the spreading matrix that is applied to a group may be<br>
different and can be configured. After the symbols are processed through the spreading<br>
matrix, then the output(s) can be re-grouped into at least two groups. Here, the re-grouped<br>
outputs comprise at least one selected output from each of the at least two groups.<br>
Thereafter, these re-grouped outputs can be spread again using the spreading matrix.<br>
Again, the spreading matrix that is applied to a group may be different and can be<br>
configured. After the outputs are processed through another spreading matrix, they are<br>
inputted to an. inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT).<br>
A rotation scheme such as the multi-stage rotation can also be employed by a<br>
generalized MC-CDM or multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA). Figure<br>
5 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a general block of the MC-CDM.<br>
Figure 5 is another exemplary diagram of a generalized MC-CDM structure. More<br>
specifically, the processes as described with respect to Figure 5 are similar to those of<br>
Figure 1 except that Figure 5 is based on generalized MC-CDM or MC-CDMA that uses<br>
rotation (e.g., multi-stage rotation). Here, after channel coding, the coded data are rotated<br>
and/or multiplexed, followed by modulation using inverse discrete Fourier transform<br>
0DFT)orIFFT.<br><br>
At the receiving end, the modulated symbols are demodulated using discrete Fourier<br>
transform (DFT) or fast Fourier transform (FFT). They are then despread and detected,<br>
followed by channel decoding.<br>
In addition, interlacing is available in the generalized MC-CDM. In Ix evolution<br>
data optimized (ixEV-DO) BCMCS and enhanced BCMCS (EBCMCS), the multipath<br>
delay spread is about Td = 3.7us and the coherent bandwidth is around Bc =1/Td = 270kHz.<br>
Therefore, the maximum frequency diversity order is This means, in<br>
order to capture the maximum frequency diversity here, the MC-CDM spreading gain L &gt; 5<br>
is possibly enough-<br>
Based on the above analysis, a frequency-domain interlaced MC-CDM can be used.<br>
Figure 6 is an exemplary diagram illustrating frequency-domain interlaced MC-CDM.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, each slot, indicated by different fills, can be one tone (or sub-carrier)<br>
or multiple consecutive tones (or sub-carriers).<br>
The tone(s) or sub-carrier(s) or symbol(s) can be rotated differently. In other words,<br>
the product distance, which can be defined as the product of Euclidean distances, can be<br>
maximized. In detail, a minimum product distance, which is used for optimizing modulation<br>
diversity, can be shown by the following equation. The minimum product distance can also<br>
be referred to as Euclidean distance tmnimization.<br><br><br>
Referring to Equation 3, sj EA denotes the transmitted symbols. Furthermore,<br>
optimization with maximizing the minimum production distance can be done by solving the<br>
following equation.<br>
[Equation 4]<br><br>
For example, for the traditional quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), U1 (eJt ) can.<br>
be decided by calculating d(ejt=1/2 Δ2-(ejtΔ2)2 where A12 e{±l,±J,±l±j).<br>
As discussed, each tone or symbol pan be rotated differently. For example, a first<br>
symbol can be applied QPSK, a second symbol can be applied a binary phase shift keying<br>
(BPSK), and nth symbol can be applied 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM). To<br>
put differently, each tone or symbol has different modulation angle.<br><br><br><br>
Referring     to     Equation     3,     the     diversity     can     be     denoted     by<br>
, and the interference matrix can be denoted<br>
  . Here, the interference matrix can be ISI or<br>
multiple access interference (MAI).<br>
A total diversity of the generalized MC-CDM can be represented as shown in<br>
Equation 7.<br><br><br>
Referring to Equation 4, the total diversity of the generalized MC-CDM is<br>
independent on the precoding matrix U. However, for each symbol or user, the diversity<br>
gain may be different to each.<br>
Further, the interference of the generalized MC-CDM can be represented as shown<br>
in Equation 8.<br><br>
Here, there is some self-interference or multi-user<br>
interference. In other words, due to frequency-selectivity in OFDM-liked orthogonal<br>
modulation, there is possible interference if some preceding or spreading is applied.<br>
Furthermore, it can be shown that this interference can be maximized when the rotation<br>
angel is 9 = /4.<br>
4<br>
In designing a MC-CDM transceiver, inter alia, an inter-symbol or multiple access<br>
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be defined as follows.<br><br><br>
Referring to Equation 9 denotes the channel fading difference. The SIR can<br>
be defined based on channel fading and rotation.<br>
Rotation can also be performed based on receiver profile. This can be done through<br>
upper layer signaling. More specifically, at least two parameters can be configured, namely,<br>
spreading gain and rotation angle.<br>
In operation, a receiver can send feedback information containing its optimum<br>
rotation angle and/or rotation index. The rotation angle and/or rotation index can be mapped<br>
to the proper rotation angle by a transmitter based on a table (or index). This table or index<br>
is known by both the transmitter and the receiver. This can be done any time when it is the<br>
best time for the transmitter and/or receiver.<br>
For example, if the receiver (or access terminal) is registered with the network, it<br>
usually sends its profile to the network. This profile includes, inter alia, the rotation angle<br>
and/or index.<br>
Before the transmitter decides to send signals to the receiver, it may ask the receiver<br>
as to the best rotation angle. In response, the receiver can send the best rotation angle to the<br>
transmitter. Thereafter, the transmitter can send the signals based on the feedback<br>
information and its own decision.<br><br>
During transmission of the signals, the transmitter can periodically request from the<br>
receiver to send its updated rotation angle. Alternatively, the transmitter can request an<br>
update of the rotation angle from the receiver after the transmitter is finished transmitting.<br>
At any time, the receiver can send the update (or updated rotation angle) to the<br>
transmitter. The transmission of the update (or feedback information) can be executed<br>
through an access channel, traffic channel, control channel, or other possible channels.<br>
With respect to channel coding, coding can help minimize demodulation errors and<br>
therefore achieve the throughput in addition to signal design for higher spectral efficiency.<br>
In reality, most capacity-achieving codes are designed to balance the implementation<br>
complexity and achievable performance.<br>
Gray code is one of an example of channel coding which is also known as reflective<br>
binary code. Gray code or the reflective binary code is a binary numeral system where two<br>
successive values differ in only one digit. Figure 7 is an exemplary diagram illustrating an<br>
example of Gray coding.<br>
Gray code for bits-to-symbol mapping, also called Gray mapping, can be<br>
implemented with other channel coding scheme. Gray mapping is generally accepted as the<br>
optimal mapping rule for minimizing bit error rate (BER). Gray mapping for regular<br>
QPSK/QPSK hierarchical modulation (or 16QAM modulation) is shown in Figure 8 where<br>
the codewords with minimtan Euclid distance have minimum Hamming distance as well.<br><br>
In the figures to follow, the Gray mapping rule is described. More specifically, each<br>
enhancement layer bits-to-symbol and base layer bits-to-symbol satisfy the Gray mapping<br>
requirement where the closest two symbols only have difference of one or the least bit(s).<br>
Furthermore, the overall bits-to-symbol mapping rule satisfies the Gray mapping rule.<br>
Figure 8 is an exemplary diagram illustrating mapping for regular QPSK/QPSK<br>
hierarchical modulation or 16QAM modulation. Referring to Figure 8, the enhancement<br>
layer bits and the base layer bits can be arbitrarily combined so that every time when the<br>
base layer bits are detected, the enhancement layer bits-to-symbol mapping table/rule can be<br>
decided, for example. In addition, both the base layer and the enhancement layer are QPSK.<br>
Furthermore, every point (or symbol) is represented and/or mapped by bob1b2b3.<br>
More specifically, the circle in the center of the diagram and the lines connecting<br>
two (2) points (or symbols) (e.g., point 0011 and point 0001 or point 0110 and point 1110)<br>
represent connection with only one bit difference between neighbors. Here, the connected<br>
points are from different layers. In other words, every connected points (or symbol) are<br>
different base layer bits and enhancement layer bits.<br>
Furthermore, every point can be represented by four (4) bits (e.g., bob1b2b3) in which<br>
the first bit (bo) and the third bit (fa) represent the base layer bits, and the second bit (bi)<br>
and the fourth bit (b3) represent the enhancement bits. That is, two (2) bits from the base<br>
layer and the two (2) bits from the enhancement layer are interleaved together to represent<br><br>
every resulted point. By interleaving the bits instead of simple concatenation of the bits<br>
from two layers, additional diversity gain can be potentially attained.<br>
Figure 9 is an exemplary diagram illustrating bits-to-symbol mapping for<br>
16QAM/QPSK. This figure refers to bits-to-symbol mapping. This mapping can be used by<br>
both the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
If a transmitter desires to send bits bob1b2b3b4b5s, the transmitter needs to look for a<br>
mapped symbol to send.' Hence, if a receiver desires to demodulate the received symbol, the<br>
receiver can use this figure to find/locate the demodulated bits.<br>
Furthermore, Figure 9 represents 16QAM/QPSK hierarchical modulation. In other<br>
words, the base layer is modulated by 16QAM, and the enhancement layer is modulated by<br>
QPSK. Moreover, 16QAM/QPSK can be referred to as a special hierarchical modulation. In<br>
other words, the base layer signal and the enhancement signal have different initial phase.<br>
For example, the base layer signal phase is 0 while the enhancement layer signal phase is<br>
theta (0).<br>
Every symbol in Figure 9 is represented by bits sequence, S5S4S3S2S1S0, in which bits<br>
S3 and So are bits from the enhancement layer while the other bits (e.g., S5, S4, S2, and S1)<br>
belong to the base layer.<br>
Figure 10 is another exemplary diagram illustrating bits-to-symbol mapping for<br>
16QAM/QPSK. The difference between Figure 10 and previous Figure 9 is that every<br>
symbol in Figure 10 is represented by bits sequence, S5S4S3S2S1S0, in which bits S5 and S2 are<br><br>
bits from the enhancement layer while the other bits (e.g., S4, S3, S1, and So) are from the base<br>
layer.<br>
Figure 11 is another exemplary diagram illustrating bits-to-symbol mapping for<br>
16QAM/QPSK. The difference between Figure 11 and previous Figures 9 and/or 10 is that<br>
every symbol in Figure 11 is represented by bits sequence, S5S4S3S2S1S0., in which bits S5 and<br>
S4 are bits from the enhancement layer while the other bits (e.g., S3, S2, s1, and so) are from<br>
the base layer.<br>
Figure 12 is another exemplary diagram illustrating bits-to-symbol mapping for<br>
16QAM/QPSK. The difference between Figure 12 and previous Figures 9, 10, and/or 11<br>
bits S5 and S2 are bits from the enhancement layer while the other bits (e.g., S4, S3, S1, and So)<br>
are from the base layer. As before, every symbol in Figure 12 is represented by bits<br>
sequence, S5S4S3S2S1S0..<br>
Further to bits sequence combinations as discussed above, the following hierarchical<br>
layer and enhancement layer combination possibilities include (1) S5S4S3S2S1S0..= b3b2b1e1boeo,<br>
(2) S5S4S3S2S1S0..= b3e1b2b1boeo, (3) S5S4S3S2S1S0.. = b3e1b2b1boeo, (4) S5S4S3S2S1S0. = eoe1b3b2b1bo,<br>
(5)S5S4S3S2S1S0 - eob3b2e1b1bo, (6) S5S4S3S2S1S0. = b3b2eob1boe1, (7) s3s2sis0 = e1b1eobo, (8)<br>
S3S2S1so= eob1e1bo, (9) s3S2S1s0= e1eob1bOj (10) s3S2S1So= eoe1b1bo, and (11) s3S2S1So = b1boeoe1.<br>
In addition to the combinations discussions of above, there are many other possible<br>
combinations. However, they all follow the same rule which is the Gray rule or the Gray<br>
mapping rule. As discussed, each enhancement layer bits-to-symbol mapping and base layer<br><br>
bits-to-symbol mapping satisfy the Gray mapping rule requirement which is that the closest<br>
two symbols only have difference of one bit or less. Moreover, the overall bits-to-symbol<br>
mapping rule satisfies the Gray mapping rule as well.<br>
Further, the enhancement layer bits and the base layer bits can be arbitrarily<br>
combined so that every time the base layer bits are detected, the enhancement layer bits-to-<br>
symbol mapping table/rule can be decided. In addition, it is possible, for example, for<br>
S3S2S1So=e1eob1b0 QPSK7QPSK, the Gray mapping rule for enhancement layer<br>
S3S2I l=eieol 1 to be not the exactly the same as S3S2lO=eieolG. Moreover, for example, it is<br>
possible S3S2ll=e1eoll is a rotated version as s3s2l0=e1eol0, S3S211=1 Ill's position is the<br>
position of s3s2l 1=1010 or s3s2l 1=0110.<br>
Figure 13 is an exemplary diagram illustrating bits-to-symbol mapping for<br>
QPSK/QPSK. Referring to Figure 13, the bits-to-symbol mapping can be used by both the<br>
transmitter and the receiver. If a transmitter desires to send bits bob1b2b3, the transmitter<br>
needs to look for a mapped symbol to send. Hence, if a receiver desires to demodulate the<br>
received symbol, the receiver can use ibis figure to find/locate the demodulated bits.<br>
Furthermore, Figure 13 represents QPSK/QPSK hierarchical modulation. In other<br>
words, the base layer is modulated by QPSK, and the enhancement layer is also modulated<br>
by QPSK. Moreover, QPSK/QPSK can be referred to as a special hierarchical modulation.<br>
That is, the base layer signal and the enhancement signal have different initial phase. For<br><br>
example, the base layer signal phase is 0 while the enhancement layer signal phase is theta<br>
0).<br>
Every symbol in Figure 13 is represented by bits sequence, s3s2s1s0, in which bits s5<br>
and si are bits from the enhancement layer while the other bits (e.g., s2 and so) belong to the<br>
base layer.<br>
Further, in the QPSK/QPSK example, the enhancement layer bits-to-symbol<br>
mapping rules may be different from the base layer symbol-to-symbol. Figure 14 is an<br>
exemplary diagram illustrating an enhancement layer bits-to-symbol for base layer 0x0. In<br>
other words, Figure 14 illustrates an example of how the base layer bits are mapped.<br>
For example, the symbols indicated in the upper right quadrant denote the base layer<br>
symbols of '00'. This means that as long as the base layer bits are '00', whatever the<br>
enhancement layer is, Hie corresponding layer modulated symbol is one of the four (4)<br>
symbols of this quadrant.<br>
Figure 15 is an exemplary diagram illustrating an enhancement layer bits-to-symbol<br>
for base layer 0x1. Similarly, this diagram illustrates another example of how the base layer<br>
bits are mapped. For example, the symbols of in the upper left quadrant denote the base<br>
layer symbols of '01'. This means that as long as the base layer bits are '01', whatever the<br>
enhancement layer bits are, the corresponding layer modulated symbols is one of the<br>
symbols of the upper left quadrant.<br><br>
As discussed above with respect to Figures 1-3, the inputted data or data stream can<br>
be channel coded using the Gray mapping role, for example, followed by other processes<br>
including modulation- The modulation discussed here refers to layered (or superposition)<br>
modulation. The layered modulation is a type of modulation in which each modulation<br>
symbol has bits corresponding to both a base layer and an enhancement layer. In the<br>
discussions to follow, the layered modulation will be described in the context of broadcast<br>
and multicast services (BCMCS).<br>
In general, layered modulation can be a superposition of any two modulation<br>
schemes. In BCMCS, a QPSK enhancement layer is superposed on a base QPSK or 16-<br>
QAM layer to obtain the resultant signal constellation. The energy ratio r is the power ratio<br>
between the base layer and the enhancement. Furthermore, the enhancement layer is rotated<br>
by the angle Q in counter-clockwise direction.<br>
Figure 16 is an exemplary diagram, showing the signal constellation of the layered<br>
modulator with respect to QPSK/QPSK hierarchical modulation. Referring to QPSK/QPSK.<br>
hierarchical modulation, which means QPSK base layer and QPSK enhancement layer, each<br>
modulation symbol contains four (4) bits, namely, S3, S2, S1, S0. Here, there are two (2) most<br>
significant bits (MSBs) which are S3 and S2, and two (2) least significant bits (LSBs) which<br>
are S1 and so. The two (2) MSBs are from the base layer and the two LSBs come from the<br>
enhancement layer.<br><br>
Given energy ratio r between the base layer and enhancement layer <br>
and can be defined such that2 (a2+02) ~ 1. Here, a denotes the amplitude of<br>
the base layer, and J3 denotes the amplitude of enhancement layer. Moreover,<br>
2(a2 + β2):=l is a constraint which is also referred to as power constraint and more<br>
accurately referred to as normalization.<br>
Table 1 illustrates a layered modulation table with QPSK. base layer and QPSK<br>

$, and carrier frequency f0 . Moreover, φ{t) denotes the pulse-shaping, the shape of a<br>
transmit symbol.<br>
In the above definition of S(t), except the mt and mQ value, other parameters can<br>
usually either be shared between the transmitter and the receiver or be detected by the<br>
receiver itself. For correctly demodulating s{t), it is necessary to define and share the<br>
possible value information of m7 and mQ.<br>
The possible value of ml (k) and mg (k), which denote the m, and mQ value for the<br>
kth symbol, are given in Table 1. It shows for representing each group inputs bits s3, s2, su<br>
so the symbol shall be modxjlated by corresponding parameters shown in me table.<br>
The discussion with respect to the complex modulation symbol can be applied in a<br>
similar or same manner to the following discussions of various layered modulations. That is,<br>
the above discussion of the complex modulation symbol can be applied to the tables to<br>
follow.<br>
Figure 17 is an exemplary diagram illustrating the signal constellation of the layered<br>
modulator with respect to 16QAM/QPSK hierarchical modulation. Referring to<br>
16QAM/QPSK hierarchical modulation, which means 16QAM base layer and QPSK<br>
enhancement layer, each modulation symbol contains six 6 bits - s5, S4, S3, S2, s1, so. The<br>
four (4) MSBs, s5, S4, S3 and s2, come from the base layer, and the two (2) LSBs, S\ and so,<br>
come from the enhancement layer.<br><br>

s5, s4, s3, s2, s1, so. Here, the position of each symbol is given in a two-dimensional signal<br>
space   ( m1,   ,  mQ   ).   This   means   that   each   symbol   can   be   represented   by<br><br><br>

sin(2nf t + Q) denote the carrier signal with initial phase 0 and carrier frequency f0 .<br>
Moreover, (t) denotes the pulse-shaping, the shape of a transmit symbol.<br>
In the above definition of S(t), except the m1, and mQ value, other parameters can<br>
usually either be shared between the transmitter and the receiver or be detected by the<br>
receiver itself. For correctly demodulating S(i), it is necessary to define and share the<br>
possible value information of m1 and mQ,<br>

kth symbol, are given, in Table 1. It shows for representing each group inputs bits ss, s4, s3,<br>

Further, another application example for BCMCS for hierarchical modulation is<br>
discussed below. In general, layered modulation can be a superposition of any two<br>
modulation schemes. In BCMCS, a QPSK enhancement layer is superposed on a base<br>
QPSK or 16-QAM layer to obtain the resultant signal constellation. The energy ratio r is<br>
the power ratio between the base layer and the enhancement. Furthermore, the enhancement<br>
layer is rotated by the angle 9 in counter-clockwise direction.<br><br>
Figure 18 is an exemplary diagram showing the signal constellation for the layered<br>

the  base  layer,   and  β denotes  the   amplitude   of enhancement  layer.   Moreover,<br>
2(α2+β2)=\ is a constraint which is also referred to as power constraint and more<br>
accurately referred to as normalization.<br>
Table 3 illustrates a layered modulation table with QPSK base layer and QPSK<br>
enhancement layer.<br>
[Table 3]<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 3, each column defines the symbol position for each four (4) bits,<br>
S3, S2, S1, S0. Here, the position of each symbol is given in a two-dimensional signal space<br>
( m1 , mQ ). This means that each symbol can be represented by<br>
S(t) = [M1 cos(27nfot + 0o)+MQ *sia(27f0t + 0)](t). Simply put, the complex modulation<br>
symbol S = ( mt , mQ ) for each [S3, S2, S1, So] is specified in<br>
S(t) = [M1 cos(27nfot + 0o)+MQ *sia(27f0t + 0)](t).<br><br>

,. and carrier frequency f0 . Moreover, φ{t) denotes the pulse-shaping, the shape of a<br>
transmit symbol.<br>
In the above definition of S(t), except the m, and mQ value, other parameters can<br>
usually either be shared between the transmitter and the receiver or be detected by the<br>
receiver itself. For correctly demodulating S(t), it is necessary to define and share the<br>
possible value information of m, and mQ.<br>
The possible value of ml (k) and mQ(K), which denote the m} and mQ value for the<br>
k* symbol, are given in Table 1. It shows for representing each group inputs bits s3, S2, s1,<br>
so the symbol shall be modulated by corresponding parameters shown in the table-<br>
Figure 19 is an exemplary diagram illustrating the signal constellation of the layered<br>
modulator with respect to 16QAM/QPSK hierarchical modulation. Referring to another<br>
16QAM/QPSK hierarchical modulation, which means 16QAM base layer and QPSK.<br>
enhancement layer, each modulation symbol contains six (6) bits - S5, S4, S3, S2, S1, S0. The<br>
four (4) MSBs, S5, 54, S3 and S2, come from the base layer, and the two (2) LSBs, S1 and S0,<br>
come from the enhancement layer.<br>
Given energy ratio r between the base layer and enhancement layer, <br>
and can be defined such that2fa1 +JB2) =1. Here, a denotes the amplitude of<br>
the  base   layer,   and  fi denotes   the  amplitude  of enhancement   layer.   Moreover,<br><br>
2(α2 +β2) =l is a constraint which is also referred to as power constraint and more<br>
accurately referred to as normalization.<br>
Table 4 illustrates a layered modulation table with 16QAM base layer and QPSK<br>
enhancement layer.<br>
(Table 4]<br><br><br><br><br>
Referring to Table 4, each column defines the symbol position for each six (6) bits,<br>
S5, S4, S3, S2, S1, S0. Here, the position of each symbol is given in a two-dimensional signal<br>
space   (   m,   ,   mQ   ).This   means    that   each   symbol    can   be   represented   by<br><br>
S(t) = [M1, cos(2nf0t +0) + MQ *sin(2nf0t + 0))](t). Simply put, the complex modulation<br>
symbol S = ( m, , mQ ) for each [S5, S4, S3, S2, S1, so] is specified in<br>
5(t) = [M1, cos(2nf0t + 0t)+MQ* sin(2nf0t + 0 )](t') ■<br>
Here, w0 denotes carrier frequency, xQ denotes an initial phase of the carrier, and<br>
(t) denotes the symbol shaping or pulse shaping wave. Here, cos(2nf0t +0) and<br>
sin(2nf0t +0) denote the carrier signal with initial phase o and carrier frequency fQ .<br>
Moreover, p(t) denotes the pulse-shaping, the shape of a transmit symbol.<br>
In the above definition of S(/), except the m( and mQ value, other parameters can<br>
usually either be shared between the transmitter and the receiver or be detected by the<br>
receiver itself. For correctly demodulating Sif), it is necessary to define and share fee<br>
possible value information of m, and mQ.<br>
The possible value of m, (k) and mQ (k), which denote the my and mQ value for the<br>
k* symbol, are given in Table L It shows for representing each group inputs bits S5, S4, s3,<br>
S2, S1, S0 the symbol shall be modulated by corresponding parameters shown in the table.<br>
With respect to the definitions of m; and mQ in Table 1-4, in additioa to the<br>
contents, the show that the rotation angle 0 also needs to be shared along with those tables<br>
between transmitter and receiver. Table 5 can be used to address this problem regarding<br>
how the receiver and transmitter share the rotation angle information.<br>
To this end, Table 5 can be used which defines and/or maps four (4) bits to a<br>
rotation angle. If this table is known by fee receiver beforehand, then the transmitter only<br><br>
needs to sent four (4) bits to receiver to indicate to the receiver the initial rotation angle for<br>
demodulating next rotated layered modulated symbols. This table is an example of<br>
quantizing the rotation angle 9 with four (4) bits and uniform quantization. It is possible to<br>
quantize die rotation angle 6 with other number of bits and different quantization rule for<br>
different accuracy.<br>
More specifically, this table is either shared beforehand by the transmitter and<br>
receiver (e.g., access network and access terminal), downloaded to the receiver (e.g., access<br>
terminal) over the air, or only used by the transmitter (e.g., access network) when the<br>
hierarchical modulation is enabled. The default rotation word for hierarchical modulation is<br>
0000, which corresponds to 0.0.<br>
Further, this table can be used by the receiver for demodulating the rotated layered<br>
modulation. Compared with the regular or un-rotated layered modulation, the initial rotation<br>
angle is essentially zero (0). This information of initial rotation angle of zero (0) indicates<br>
an implicit consensus between the transmitter and the receiver. However, for rotated layered<br>
modulation, this information may not be implicitly shared between the transmitter and/or<br>
the receiver. In other words, a mechanism to send or indicate this initial rotation angle to the<br>
receiver is necessary.<br><br><br><br>
In a further application of the layered or superposition modulation for BCMCS,<br>
layered modulation can be a superposition of any two modulation schemes. In BCMCS, a<br>
QPSK enhancement layer is superposed on a base QPSK or 16-QAM layer to obtain the<br>
resultant signal constellation. The energy ratio r is the power ratio between the base layer<br>
and the enhancement. Furthermore, the enhancement layer is rotated by the angle 9 in<br>
counter-clockwise direction.<br>

modulation with QPSK base layer and QPSK enhancement layer. Referring to Figure 20,<br><br>

Referring to Table 4, each column defines the symbol position for each six (6) bits,<br>
S5, S4, S3, S2, S1, So. Here, the position of each symbol is given in a two-dimensional signal<br>
space   ( m,   ,  mQ ).   This   means   that   each   symbol   can   be   represented   by<br><br>

S2, S1, So the symbol shall be modulated by corresponding parameters shown in the table.<br>
However, the Euclid distance profile can change when the enhancement layer signal<br>
constellation is rotated and the power-splitting ratio is changed. This means the original<br>
Gray mapping in Fig. 21, for example, may not always be optimal. In this case, it may be<br>
necessary to perform bits-to-symbols remapping based on each Euclidean distance file<br>
instance. Figure 22 is an exemplary diagram illustrating Gray mapping for rotated<br>
QPSK/QPSK hierarchical modulation.<br><br>
The BER performance of a signal constellation can be dominated by symbol pairs<br>
with minimum Euclidean distance, especially when SNR is high. Therefore it is interesting<br>
to find optimal bits-to-synibol mapping rules, in which the codes for the closest two signals<br>
have minimum difference.<br>
in general, Gray mapping in two-dimensional signals worked with channel coding<br>
can be accepted as optimal for minimizing BER for equally likely signals. Gray mapping<br>
for regular hierarchical signal constellations is shown in Figure 21, where the codes for the<br>
closest two signals are different in only one bit. However, this kind of Euclidean distance<br>
profile may not be fixed in hierarchical modulation. An example of the minimum Euclidean<br>
distance of 16QAM/QPSK hierarchical modulation with different rotation angles is shown<br>
in Figure 23.<br>
Figure 23 is an exemplary diagram illustrating an enhanced QPSK/QPSK<br>
hierarchical modulation. Referring to Figure 23, the base layered is modulated with QPSK<br>
and the enhancement layer is modulated with rotated QPSK. If the hierarchical modulation<br>
is applied, a new QPSK/QPSK hierarchical modulation can be attained as shown in this<br>
figure.<br>
Further, the inter-layer Euclidean distance may become shortest when the power<br>
splitting ratio increases in a two-layer hierarchical modulation. This can occur if the<br>
enhancement layer is rotated. In order to minimize BER when Euclidean distance profile is<br><br>
changed in hierarchical modulation, the bits-to-symbol mapping can be re-done or<br>
performed again, as shown in Figures 24 and 25.<br>
Figure 24 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a new QPSK/QPSK hierarchical<br>
modulation. Moreover, Figure 25 is another exemplary diagram illustrating a new<br>
QPSK/QPSK hierarchical modulation.<br>
In view of the discussions of above, a new bit-to-symbol generation structure can be<br>
introduced. According to the conventional structure, a symbol mapping mode selection was<br>
not available. Figure 26 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a new bit-to-symbol block.<br>
Here, the symbol mapping mode can be selected when the bits-to-symbol mapping is<br>
performed. More specifically, a new symbol mapping mode selection block can be added<br>
for controlling and/or selecting bits-to-symbol mapping rule based on the signal<br>
constellation of hierarchical modulation and channel coding used<br>
