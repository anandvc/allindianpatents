				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission.<br>
Generally, the present invention relates to an automatic transmission. More particularly, the present invention relates to a powertrain of an automatic transmission that realizes multiple shift speeds with a combination of a plurality of planetary gearsets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A typical shift mechanism of an automatic transmission utilizes a combination of a plurality of planetary gear sets. A powertrain of such an automatic transmission that includes the plurality of planetary gear sets changes rotation speed and torque received from a torque converter of the automatic transmission, and accordingly changes and transmits the changed torque to an output shaft.<br>
It is well known that when a transmission realizes a greater number of shift speeds, speed ratios of the transmission can be more optimally designed and therefore a vehicle can have better fuel mileage and better performance. For that reason, an automatic transmission that enables more shift speeds is constantly under investigation.<br>
In addition, with the same number of speeds, features of a powertrain such as durability, efficiency in power transmission, and size depend a lot on the layout of combined planetary gearsets. Therefore, designs for a combining structure of a powertrain are also under constant investigation.<br>
A manual transmission that has too many speeds causes inconvenience of excessively frequent shifting operations to a driver. Therefore, the positive features of more shift-speeds are more important for automatic transmissions because an automatic transmission automatically controls shifting operations basically without needing manual operation.<br>
In addition to various developments regarding four and five speed powertrains, powertrains of automatic transmissions realizing six forward speeds and one reverse speed have recently been introduced, an example of which is found in U.S. patent US6.071,208 that was issued on June 6, 2000.<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates a powertrain of the patent US6,071,208, and FIG. 16 shows an operational chart for the powertrain.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, the powertrain of the patent US6,071,208 includes a double pinion planetary gearset PG1 and a pair of single pinion planetary gearsets PG2 and PG3. A first carrier 4 is fixedly connected to an input shaft 2, and a second carrier 22 always acts as an output element.<br>
Regarding connections between operational elements, a first ring gear 6 and a third ring gear 8, a second sun gear 12 and a third sun gear 10, and a second ring gear 16 and a third carrier 14 are fixedly interconnected, respectively. Meanwhile, the first carrier 4 is variably connected to a first sun gear 18 and the third carrier 14 interposing a first clutch C1 and a second clutch<br>
C2, respectively.<br>
In addition, the powertrain further includes a first brake B1 that can stop rotation of the fixedly connected second and third sun gears 12 and 10, a second brake B2 that can stop rotation of the third carrier 14, a third brake B3 that can stop rotation of the first and third ring gears 6 and 8, and a fourth brake B4 that can stop the first sun gear 18.<br>
As described above, the six-speed powertrain of US6.071,208 includes six friction elements of two clutches and four brakes. However, it is preferable to use fewer friction elements to enable six forward speeds and one reverse speed so that an automatic transmission can be more light and compact.<br>
FIG. 16 is an operational chart for the powertrain of US6,071,208, and FIG. 17A-17F are charts showing operation states obtained when the powertrain is operated according to the operational chart in FIG. 16.<br>
In particular, FIG. 17A shows detailed specifications of the powertrain of US6,071,208, i.e., gear ratios of each planetary gearset. FIG. 17B shows speed ratios in each shift-speed of the powertrain obtained by the detailed specification of FIG. 17A. In addition, FIG. 17C shows rotation speeds of each operational element relative to that of the input element, for each shift-speed. FIG. 17D shows slip speeds of friction elements at each shift-speed. FIG. 17E shows torque loads that each operational element or each friction element undertakes. FIG. 17F shows planetary gearsets that take part in power transmission in each shift-speed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, the powertrain of 1186,071,208 operates the first and fourth brakes B1 and B4 at a first speed, the first clutch C1 and the first<br>
brake B1 at a second speed, the second clutch C2 and the first brake B1 at a third speed, the first and second clutches C1 and C2at a fourth speed, the second clutch C2 and the fourth brake B4 at a fifth speed, and the second clutch C2 and the third brake B3 at a sixth speed, respectively. The second and fourth brakes B2 and B4 are operated at a reverse speed.<br>
Referring to the operational chart, the operation state of each operational element of the powertrain of 1186,071,208 is described in detail. The planetary gearsets of the powertrain are supposed to have gear ratios shown in FIG. 17A such that the speed ratios shown in FIG. 17B are achieved.<br>
(1)	At the third forward speed, the first sun gear 18 rotates at a speed of<br>
more than twice that of the rotation speed of the input shaft (refer to FIG. 17C).<br>
In addition, the slip speed of the fourth brake B4, which is not operated in the<br>
third speed, becomes as high as that of the first sun gear 18 (refer to FIG. 17D).<br>
The third forward speed is frequently engaged in the case that acceleration is needed, since a six-speed automatic transmission usually achieves the speed ratio of 1:1 at the fourth forward speed. Therefore, durability of an automatic transmission deteriorates if an element always rotates at a high speed in such a shift speed.<br>
(2)	Referring to FIG. 17D, slip speeds of friction elements are excessive<br>
for all speed ranges, which deteriorates durability of an automatic transmission<br>
and also causes excessive power loss. Therefore, the powertrain should be<br>
improved to have lesser slip speeds of friction elements for speeds D2-D6.<br>
In particular, the sum of slip speeds of friction elements becomes excessively large at the sixth forward speed D6, and therefore, the d urability<br>
problem is at its maximum at the sixth forward speed.<br>
(3) Referring to FIG. 17F, when considering the number of planetary gearsets that take part in power transmission, at least two planetary gearsets take part in the power transmission for the fifth and sixth speeds, which deteriorates power efficiency. It is preferable that efficiency of power transmission is improved.<br>

The fourth planetary gearset PG4 is a single pinion planetary gearset, and includes a fourth sun gear S4, a fourth carrier PC4, and a fourth ring gear R4 as operational elements thereof. A fourth pinion gear P4, being engaged with both the fourth ring gear R4 and the fourth sun gear S4, is connected to and carried by the fourth carrier PC4.<br>

The first carrier PC1 is fixedly connected to the fourth carrier PC4.<br>
The first sun gear S1 is fixedly connected to the second sun gear S2.<br>
The second ring gear R2 is always stationary by being fixedly connected to the transmission case 300.<br>
The third sun gear S3 always acts as an input element by being fixedly connected to the input shaft 100.<br>

That is, one common pinion carrier CPC commonly acts as a carrier for the first and fourth planetary gearsets PG1 and PG4. That is, first pinion gear P1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 and the fourth pinion gear P4 of the fourth planetary gearset PG4 are interconnected by one common pinion carrier CPC, and they are under the same operation.<br>
Therefore, the first planetary gearset PG1 and the fourth planetary gearset PG4 form a compound planetary gearset CPG.<br>
Regarding such a compound planetary gearset CPG, in the description hereinafter, the first planetary gearset PG1 and the fourth planetary gearset PG4 are supposed to have the same ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio.<br>
However, such a supposition is for better description and understanding of the spirit of the present invention, and it should not be understood that the scope of the present invention is limited thereto. The first planetary gearset PG1 may have a different ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio from the fourth planetary gearset PG4, and consequences of such difference are obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art from the following description.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, according to a six-speed powertrain of a first embodiment of the present invention, the input shaft 100 is disposed in a same direction of the output gear 200 with respect to the third planetary gearset PG3.<br>
In addition, one of the first and second clutches C1 and C2 is disposed<br>
toward the input shaft 100 with respect to the third planetary gearset PG3. Also, another one of the first and second clutches C1 and C2 is disposed opposite of the input shaft 100 with respect to the second planetary gearset PG2.<br>
In more detail, the first clutch C1 is disposed toward the input shaft 100 with respect to the third planetary gearset PG3, and the second c lutch C2 is disposed opposite of the input shaft 100 with respect to the second planetary gearset PG2.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, according to a six-speed powertrain of a second or third embodiment of the present invention, the input shaft 100 is disposed in a same direction of the output gear 200 with respect to the third planetary gearset PG3, and both of the first and second clutches C1 and C2 are disposed toward the input shaft 100 with respect to the third planetary gearset PG3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, according to a six-speed powertrain of a second embodiment of the present invention, the first and second clutches C1 and C2 are disposed in a sequence of the first clutch C1 and the second clutch C2, in a direction from the third planetary gearset PG3 to the input shaft 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, according to a six-speed powertrain of a third embodiment of the present invention, the first and second clutches C1 and C2 are disposed in a sequence of the second clutch C2 and the first clutch C1, in a direction from the third planetary gearset PG3 to the input shaft 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, according to a six-speed powertrain of a fourth embodiment of the present invention, the input shaft 100 is disposed opposite of the output gear 200 with respect to the second planetary gearset PG2, and<br>
both of the first and second clutches C1 and C2 are disposed toward the input shaft 100 with respect to the second planetary gearset PG2.<br>
In more detail, according to a six-speed powertrain of a fourth embodiment of the present invention, the first and second clutches C1 and C2 are disposed in a sequence of the first clutch C1 and the second clutch C2, in a direction from the second planetary gearset PG2 to the input shaft 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 through FIG. 4, a six-speed powertrain of any of first through fourth embodiment of the present invention further includes a one way clutch OWC disposed in parallel with the first brake B1.<br>
Due to such a one way clutch OWC, a first forward speed can be realized by an operation of the third clutch C3 without an operation of the first brake B1.<br>
According to a six-speed powertrains of first through fourth embodiments of the present invention, each of the first and second brakes B1 and B2 may by realized by a wet-type multi-plate brake or a band brake.<br>
Hereinafter, an operation of a six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention is described in detail. The following description may be equally applied to first through fourth embodiments of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, a six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention operates: the third clutch C3 and the first brake B1 at a first forward speed D1; the third clutch C3 and the second brake B2 at a second forward speed D2; the third clutch C3 and the first clutch C1 at a third forward speed D3; the third clutch C3<br>
and the second clutch C2 at a fourth forward speed D4; the first clutch C1 and the second clutch C2 at a fifth forward speed D5; and the second clutch C2 and the second brake B2 at a sixth forward speed D6.<br>
The first clutch C1 and the first brake B1 are operated at a reverse speed R.<br>
Specific values of shift ratios shown in FIG. 5 are obtained in the case that first, second, third, and fourth planetary gearsets PG1, PG2, PG3, and PG4 have ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios as shown in FIG. 14A. When the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the first, second, third, and fourth planetary gearsets PG1, PG2, PG3, and PG4 differ from FIG. 14A, values of shift ratios for the different ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios may be obviously calculated by a person of ordinary skill in the art from the detailed description of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 6 is a lever diagram illustrating operational nodes (N1 through N6) of a six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission according to embodiments of the present invention, in the case that the first planetary gearset P G1 and t he fourth p lanetary gearset P G4 h ave e qual r ing g ear/sun gear tooth ratios.<br>
Therefore, operational elements of the fourth planetary gearset PG4 show rotational characteristics equal to operational elements of the first planetary gearset PG1. Therefore, they may be represented by operational elements of the first planetary gearset PG1 and be disregarded hereinafter.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the first ring gear R1, the first carrier PC1, and the first sun gear S1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 are sequentially located at<br>
operational nodes N2, N4, and N6 in the lever diagram.<br>
The second ring gear R2, the second carrier PC2, and the second sun gear S2 of the second planetary gearset PG2 are sequentially located at operational nodes N3, N5, and N6 in the lever diagram.<br>
The third sun gear S3, the third carrier PCS, and the third ring gear R3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 are sequentially located at operational nodes N1, N2, and N5 in the lever diagram.<br>
The fourth ring gear R4, the fourth carrier PC4, and the fourth sun gear S4 of the fourth planetary gearset PG4 are sequentially located at operational nodes N2, N4, and N6 in the lever diagram.<br>
As described above, the input shaft 100 is variably connected to the fourth sun gear S4 and the first carrier PC1 (or equivalently, the fourth carrier PC4) via the first and second clutches C1 and C2, respectively. Therefore, engine rotation input through the input shaft 100 is delivered to the sixth node N6 or the fourth node N4 according to an operation of the first and second clutches C1 and C2, respectively.<br>
The first carrier PC1 (or equivalently, the fourth carrier PC4) is variably connected to the transmission case 300 via the first brake B1 and the one way clutch OWC disposed in parallel. Therefore, the fourth node N4 of the first carrier PC1 and the fourth carrier PC4 may be stopped by an operation of the first brake B1 and/or the one way clutch OWC.<br>
In addition, the second carrier PC2 is variably connected to the transmission case 300 via the second brake B2. Therefore, the fifth node N5 may be stopped by an operation of the second brake B2.<br>
Hereinafter, formation of each speed by a six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention is described in detail with reference to FIGs. 7-13.<br>
In FIG. 7 through FIG. 13, L1 denotes a speed line for the first planetary gearset PG1, L2 denotes a speed line for the second planetary gearset PG2, and L3 denotes a speed line for the third planetary gearset PG3.<br>
The speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 and the speed line L2 of the second planetary gearset PG2 meet at the sixth node N6, since the first sun gear S1 and the second sun gear S2 are fixedly interconnected.<br>
The speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 and the speed line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 meet at the second node N2 since the first ring gear R1 and the third carrier PCS are fixedly interconnected.<br>
The third node N3 is always stationary since the second ring gear R2 is fixedly connected to the transmission case 300.<br>
The third sun gear S3 always rotates at an input speed since it is fixedly connected to the input shaft.<br>
Arrangement of the speed lines L1, L2, and L3 of the first, second, and third planetary gearsets PG1, PG2, and PG3 are determined by selective operation of the first, second, and third clutches C1, C2, and C3 and the first and second brakes B1 and B2 under such a condition.<br>
At the first forward speed D1, as shown in FIG. 7, the third ring gear R3 and the second carrier PC2 on the fifth node N5 rotate at a synchronized speed since the third clutch C3 operates. In addition, the fourth node N4 is stationary since the first brake B1 operates.<br>
Therefore in this case, the speed lines L1, L2, and L3 are formed as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
That is, regarding the third, fifth, and sixth nodes N3, N5, and N6 of the second planetary gearset PG2, the third node N3 is stationary, and the fifth and sixth nodes N5 and N6 rotate at a negative speed, i.e., in reverse.<br>
Regarding the second, fourth, and sixth nodes N2, N4, and N6 of the first planetary gearset PG1, the speed line L1 is a line connecting the sixth node N6 that is rotating in reverse and the fourth node N4 that is stationary.<br>
Therefore, the speed line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 is formed to be declining rightward as shown in FIG. 7. In this case, an output element of the third carrier PCS rotates at a very low speed relative to a rotation of the input shaft 100.<br>
At such a first forward speed, all the first, second, and third planetary gearsets PG1, PG2, and PG3 take part in the power transmission.<br>
At the second forward speed D2, as shown in FIG. 8, the third ring gear R3 and the second carrier PC2 on the fifth node N5 remain rotating at a synchronized speed since the third clutch C3 also operates in the second forward speed. In addition, the fifth node N5 is stationary since the second brake B2 operates.<br>
Therefore, the speed line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 is formed by the fifth node N5 that is stationary and the first node N1 rotating at the input speed. Such a speed line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 becomes slightly rotated counterclockwise, in comparison with the first forward speed. Therefore, the third carrier PCS that is an output element rotates at an<br>
increased speed in comparison with the first forward speed.<br>
At such a second forward speed, only the third planetary gearset PG3 takes part in the power transmission since the second planetary gearset PG2 is stationary.<br>
At the third forward speed D3, as shown in FIG. 9, the third ring gear R3 and the second carrier PC2 on the fifth node N5 remain rotating at a synchronized speed since the third clutch C3 also operates in the third forward speed. In addition, the sixth node N6also rotates at the same speed as the input shaft 100 since the first clutch C1 operates.<br>
Therefore in this case, the speed line L2 of the second planetary gearset PG2 is formed by the third node N3 that is stationary and the sixth node N6 rotating at the input speed. The drive line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 is determined by the fifth node N 5 on the speed line L2 of the second planetary gearset PG2.<br>
Therefore, the speed line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 becomes slightly rotated counterclockwise, in comparison with the second forward speed. Therefore, the third carrier PCS that is an output element rotates at an increased speed in comparison with the second forward speed.<br>
At such a third forward speed, the second and third planetary gearsets PG2 and PG3 take part in the power transmission.<br>
At the fourth forward speed D4, as shown in FIG. 10, the third ring gear R3 and the second carrier PC2 on the fifth node N5 remain rotating at a synchronized speed since the third clutch C3 also operates in the fourth forward speed. In addition, the fourth node N4 also rotates at the same speed as the<br>
input shaft 100 since the second clutch C2 operates.<br>
Therefore in this case, the speed lines L1, L2, and L3 are formed as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
That is, the speed line L2 of the second planetary gearset PG2 becomes slightly rotated counterclockwise, in comparison with the third forward speed.<br>
In the same way, the speed line L3 of the third planetary gearset PG3 becomes slightly rotated counterclockwise, in comparison with the third forward speed. Therefore, the third carrier PCS that is an output element rotates at an increased speed in comparison with the third forward speed.<br>
At such a fourth forward speed, all the first, second, and third planetary gearsets PG1, PG2, and PG3 take part in the power transmission.<br>
At the fifth forward speed D5, the first and second clutches C1 and C2 operate. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 11, the fourth and sixth nodes N4 and N6 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 100.<br>
Therefore, the speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 becomes horizontal at a height of rotation speed of the input shaft 100. This implies that the first planetary gearset rotates as a whole.<br>
Therefore, the second node N2 also rotates at the input speed, and accordingly, the input speed is directly output without changing.<br>
At such a fifth forward speed, none of the first, second, and third planetary gearsets PG1, PG2, and PG3 takes part in the power transmission.<br>
At the sixth forward speed D6, as shown in FIG. 12, the fourth node N4 rotates at the same speed as the input shaft 100 since the second clutch C2<br>
operates. In addition, the second carrier PC2 of the fifth node N5 becomes stationary since the second brake B2 operates.<br>
Accordingly, the second planetary gearset PG2 becomes stationary as a whole since both the second ring gear R2 and the second carrier PC2 are stationary. Therefore, the first sun gear S1 of the sixth node N6 becomes stationary.<br>
The speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 is formed by the sixth node N6 that is stationary and the fourth node N4 rotating at the input speed.<br>
Therefore, the second node N2 on the speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 rotates at a speed higher than the input speed. This implies that rotation speed output from the third carrier PCS is higher than the input speed.<br>
At such a sixth forward speed, only the first planetary gearset PG1 takes part in the power transmission.<br>
At the reverse speed R, the first clutch C1 and the first brake B1 operate. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 13, the speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 is formed by the fourth node N4 that is stationary and the sixth node N6 rotating at the input speed.<br>
Therefore, the second node N2 on the speed line L1 of the first planetary gearset PG1 rotates at a negative speed, i.e., rotates reversely, as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
At such a sixth forward speed, only the first planetary gearset PG1 takes part in the power transmission.<br>
FIGs. 14A-14F are charts showing operation states of a power train of an automatic transmission according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In particular, FIG. 14A shows detailed specifications of the powertrain according to one embodiment, i.e., gear ratios of each planetary gearset. FIG. 14B shows speed ratios in each shift-speed of the powertrain of such an embodiment obtained by the detailed specification of FIG. 14A. FIG. 14C shows rotation speeds of each operational element relative to that of the input element, for each shift-speed. FIG. 14D shows slip speeds of friction elements at each shift-speed. FIG. 14E shows torque loads that each operational element or each friction element undertakes. FIG. 14F shows planetary gearsets that take part in power transmission in each shift-speed.<br>
Details shown in FIG. 14F are apparent from the above description of shifting operation of the powertrain of the present invention, and the numbers shown in FIGs. 14C-14E may be calculated by a person skilled in the art based on the structural features and operational chart of the powertrain of the present embodiment.<br>
As is well known in the art, under hard acceleration, a high load is input to an automatic transmission. According to powertrains of preferred embodiments, no operational element rotates faster than the input speed at the second and third speeds that are frequently engaged for acceleration (refer to FIG. 14C), and therefore, slip speeds of friction elements not operated at the third speed are less than the rotation speed of the input shaft (refer to FIG. 14D).<br><br>
When the performance shown in FIG. 14D is compared with performance of a prior art powertrain shown in FIG. 17D, it is apparent that the powertrains of the present embodiments show less slip speeds of friction elements overall at the second to sixth speeds (especially at sixth forward speed) than the powertrain of, for example, U.S. Patent No. US6.071,208.<br>
Also, it is well known that more planetary gearsets implies more loss of power during power transmission. When the performance shown in FIG. 14F is compared with performance of the prior art powertrain shown in FIG. 17F, it is apparent that the powertrains of the preferred embodiments have less planetary gearsets involved in the power transmission at many of the shift-speeds, and accordingly they show better power efficiency.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, six forward speeds and one reverse speed are achieved with a minimized number of friction elements such that an automatic transmission becomes lighter and more compact.<br>
Durability is increased due to reduction of rotation speeds of operational elements at a shift-speed frequently engaged for acceleration. A further increase of durability and reduction of power loss is also achieved by reduction of slip speeds of friction elements.<br>
A shortened route of power transmission also contributes to an increase of durability and reduction of power loss.<br>
A shortened route of power transmission also contributes to an increase of durability and reduction of power loss.<br>
In addition, torque load is dispersed to all operating elements of a<br>
planetary gearset, and accordingly the powertrain may endure higher load.<br>
