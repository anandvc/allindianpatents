[0020]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 8, the forward-rearward length of the protruding portion, provided at the bottom wall of the storage box and located immediately above the intake system at the portion to which the throttle body and the fuel injection valve are arranged, matches with the forward-rearward length of the opening portion of the helmet, whereby it is possible to largely form the protruding portion within the range which does not interfere with the storage of the helmet, and it is possible to restrain the substantial reduction in the volume of the storage box while avoiding an interference with the fuel injection valve and the throttle body. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br><br>
A mode for carrying out the present invention will be explained hereinafter on the basis of a working example of the present invention which is shown in the accompanying drawings. [0022]<br>
Figs. 1 to 5 show a working example of the present invention.  Fig. 1 is a side view of a scooter-type motorcycle, Fig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view, taken along a line 2-2 in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a partially notched side view as viewed from an arrow 3-3 in Fig. 2, Fig. 4 is an enlarged view of an essential part of Fig. 3, and Fig. 5 is a sectional view, taken along a line 5-5 in Fig. 3. [0023]<br>
Firstly, in Fig. 1, a motorcycle body frame 15 of the motorcycle being of a scooter-type, is provided with a main frame pipe 17 having a head pipe 16 fixed to a front end thereof, a cross pipe 18 fixed at right angles to a rear end of the main frame pipe 17, and a pair of left and right rear frame pipes 19 continuously connected at front ends thereof to both ends of the cross pipe 18. [0024]<br>
The main frame pipe 17 includes a down frame portion 17a descending rearward from the head pipe 16, and a lower frame portion 17b substantially horizontally extending rearward from a rear end of the down frame portion 17a, both of which are continuously connected together.  The cross pipe 18 extends in a left-right direction of the<br><br>
motorcycle body frame 15 and is fixed, at an axially middle part of the cross pipe 18, at right angles to the rear end of the main frame pipe 17. [0025]<br>
To the head pipe 16, a front fork 20 which straddles a front wheel WF is steerably supported.  To an upper end of the front fork 20, a steering handlebar 21 is connected. [0026]<br>
To forward portions of the both rear frame pipes 19 in the motorcycle body frame 15, a unit-swing type power unit P, which includes an engine E arranged on the front side of a rear wheel WR, and a power transmission device M arranged laterally on the left side of the rear wheel WR, is vertically swingably supported through a link 22 so as to be vertically swingable.  The rear wheel WR is journaled to a rear portion of the power unit P. [0027]<br>
In Figs. 2 and 3, the engine E which is a single-cylinder, air-cooled four-cycle engine includes a crankcase 23 which is laterally divided into two sections including left and right crankcase half-bodies 23L, 23R, the crankcase half-bodies 23L, 2 3R being joined together to constitute the crankcase 23, a cylinder block 24 joined to the crankcase 23, a cylinder head 25 joined to the cylinder block 24, and a head cover 26 joined to the cylinder head 25.  The engine has a forward inclined cylinder axial line C.  A piston 28 is slidably fitted in a cylinder bore 27 provided in the cylinder block 24.  To the crankcase 23, a<br><br>
crank shaft 29 which extends in the width direction of the motorcycle body frame 15 is rotatably supported.  To the crank shaft 29, the piston 28 is continuously connected through a connecting rod 30 and a crank pin 31. [0028]<br>
At a lower portion of the crankcase 23 in the engine E, a pivot 36 for causing the power unit P to be swingably supported through the link 22 to the motorcycle body frame 15 is provided. [0029]<br>
The power transmission device M includes a V-belt-type continuously variable transmission 32 and a reduction gear train 34 for decelerating and transmitting the output of the continuously variable transmission 32 to a wheel shaft 33 of the rear wheel WR, and is housed within a power transmission case 35 which is continuously connected to the crankcase 23 and extends in a left lateral direction of the rear wheel WR. [0030]<br>
The power transmission case 35 includes an inner.case 38 which is integrally connected to the left crankcase half body 23L of the crankcase 23 and extends rearward, a cover 39 for covering the inner case 38 from the outside, and a gear case 40 joined to a rear portion of the inner case 38. Between the inner case 38 and the cover 3 9, a transmission chamber 41 for housing the continuously variable transmission 32 is formed.  Between the inner case 38 and the gear case 40, a gear chamber 42 for housing the<br><br>
reduction gear train 34 is formed. [0031]<br>
The continuously variable transmission 32 includes a drive pulley 43 mounted to an end portion of the crank shaft 29 which projects into the transmission chamber 41 from the crankcase 23, a driven pulley 45 mounted to an output shaft 44 which has a axial line parallel to the crank shaft 29 and is rotatably supported by the inner case 38 and the gear case 40, and an endless V-belt 46 for transmitting power to the driven pulley 45 from the drive pulley 43. [0032]<br>
The drive pulley 43 includes a fixed pulley half body 47 fixed to the crank shaft 29, and a movable pulley half body 48 which is movable so as to approach and move apart from the fixed pulley half body 47.  The movable pulley half body 48 is axially driven by a centrifugal force which acts on a weight 50 which is arranged between a ramp plate 4 9 fixed to the crank shaft 29, and the movable pulley half body 48. [0033]<br>
Moreover, the driven pulley 45 includes an inner sleeve 51 coaxially surrounding the output shaft 44 so as to be relatively rotatable, an outer sleeve 52 in which the inner sleeve 51 is slidably fitted so as to be relatively rotatable around an axial line and relatively movable in an axial direction, a fixed pulley half body 53 fixed to the inner sleeve 51, a movable pulley half body 54 opposed to<br><br>
the fixed pulley half body 53 and fixed to the outer sleeve 52, a torque cam mechanism 55 provided between the inner sleeve 51 and the outer sleeve 52 so as to apply an axial force component between the both pulley half bodies 53, 54 according to relatively rotational phase difference between the movable pulley half body 54 and the fixed pulley half body 53, and a coil spring 56 for causing the movable pulley half body 54 to be elastically urged toward the fixed pulley half body 53.  Between the fixed pulley half body 53 and the movable pulley half body 54, the V-belt 46 is wound-[0034]<br>
Between the inner sleeve 51 of the driven pulley 45 and the output shaft 44, a centrifugal clutch 57 which becomes a power transmission condition as the number of revolution of the engine exceeds a set number of revolution is provided.  Between a drive plate 58, which forms a part of this centrifugal clutch 57 and is coaxially and relatively unrotatably joined to the inner sleeve 51, and the movable pulley half body 54, a coil spring 56 surrounding the outer sleeve 52 is contractedly provided. [0035]<br>
Thus, a distance between the fixed pulley half body 53 and the movable pulley half body 54 in the driven pulley 45 is determined from a balance among an axial force produced by the torque cam mechanism 55, an axially elastic force produced by the coil spring 56, and a force applied from the V-belt 46 in such a direction as to cause the distance<br><br>
between the fixed pulley half body 53 and the movable pulley half body 54 to be increased.  When a winding radius of the winding of the V-belt 46 with respect to the drive pulley 4 3 becomes large by causing the movable pulley half body 48 to approach the fixed pulley half body 47 in the drive pulley 43, a winding radius of the winding of the V-belt 46 with respect to the driven pulley 45 becomes small. [0036]<br>
The wheel shaft 33 of the rear wheel WR is rotatably supported by the inner case 38 and the gear case 40.  The reduction gear train 34 which is provided between the output shaft 44 and the wheel shaft 33 is housed within the gear chamber 42. [0037]<br>
Again in Fig. 1, between a rear portion of the power transmission case 35 in the power unit P, and a left side rear frame pipe 19 of the pair of left and right rear frame pipes 19, a rear cushion unit 59 is provided.  Moreover, an exhaust pipe 60 for introducing an exhaust gas from a lower portion of the cylinder head 25 in the engine E is extended laterally on the right side of the rear wheel WR from the engine E.  This exhaust pipe 60 is connected to an exhaust muffler 61 which is arranged laterally on the right side of the rear wheel WR. [0038]<br>
Focusing on Fig. 3, to an upper side wall of the cylinder head 25 in the engine E, an intake system 63 which has a fuel injection valve 62 and is extended rearward from<br><br>
the cylinder head 25 is connected.  This intake system 63 includes an intake pipe 64 formed separately from the cylinder head 25 and joined to the cylinder head 25, the fuel injection valve 62 mounted to the intake pipe 64, a throttle body 65 whose downstream end is connected to an upstream end of the intake pipe 64, and an air cleaner 66 connected to an upstream end of the throttle body 65 and arranged laterally on the left side of the rear wheel WR. The air cleaner 66 is supported by the power transmission case 35 below the air cleaner.  Moreover, the intake pipe 64 is arranged on a vertical line VL passing a center of the pivot 36 provided at a lower part of the crankcase 23 in the engine E in order to cause the engine E to be swingably supported to the motorcycle body frame 15. [0039]<br>
In Fig. 4, the intake pipe 64 is formed in such a manner that a side of the intake pipe further forward than at least a part of the intake pipe to which the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted is formed so as to have a circular arc-shape bulged forwardly and obliquely upward in side view. In this working example, the entire intake pipe 64 is formed so as to have a circular are-shape bulged forwardly and obliquely upward in side view. At a downstream end of the intake pipe 64, a flat junction surface 68 which is joined through an insulator 67 to the upper side wall of the cylinder head 25 is formed. [0040]<br>
The fuel injection valve 62 which has an upward<br><br>
projecting coupler portion 62a at a rear portion thereof is mounted to the intake pipe 64 so as to inject fuel toward an intake port 69 which is provided at the cylinder head 25 so as to communicate with the interior of the intake pipe 64.  A tip end of the fuel injection valve 62 is inserted in a mounting hole 70 formed in the intake pipe 64. Moreover, at a middle portion of an axial direction of the mounting hole 70, an annular abutment step portion 71 which faces outside is formed.  The fuel injection valve 62 is inserted in the mounting hole 70 so as to abut on the abutment step portion 71. [0041]<br>
On the other hand, at the intake pipe 64, a wall portion 64a which covers, from the front, the fuel injection valve 62 which is in a condition of being inserted in the mounting hole 70 is provided integrally.  To a mounting seat surface 72 which is provided at an upper end of the wall portion 64a, a retainer member 7 3 which is fitted on a rear portion of the fuel injection valve 62 at a portion except the coupler portion 62a and interposedly holds the fuel injection valve 62 between the retainer member and the abutment step portion 71 of the intake pipe 64 is fastened by a plurality of bolts 74, for example, a pair of bolts. Moreover, the mounting seat surface 72 is formed in parallel with a flat junction surface 68 which is formed at the downstream end of the intake pipe 64 in order to join the intake pipe 64 to the cylinder head 25.  The annular step portion 71 of the mounting hole 70 is also flatly<br><br>
formed in parallel with the junction surface 68. [0042]<br>
Between forward portions of the both rear frame pipes 19 in the motorcycle body frame 15, a storage box 79 is supported so as to be located above the intake system 63. A rider's seat 80 for covering the storage box 79 from above is supported to an upper part of a forward portion of the storage box 79 so as to be openable and closable. [0043]<br>
Within the storage box 79, a helmet 77 which is formed by bonding an interior pad 77b onto an inner of a shell 77a can be stored with an opening portion 78 thereof facing downward. [0044]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5 together, at a bottom wall 79a of the storage box 79, a protruding portion 81 which is to project into the opening portion 78 of the helmet 77 stored within the storage box 79 is protrusively provided in such a manner to be arranged immediately above the intake system 63 at a portion at which the fuel injection valve 62 and the throttle body 65 are arranged, and form a downward opening concavity portion 82. . Moreover, the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted to the intake pipe 64 in such a manner that the coupler portion 62a at the upper portion thereof is allowed to be projected into the concavity portion 82. [0045]<br>
Moreover, a forward-rearward length of the protruding portion 81 located immediately above the intake system 63<br><br>
at the portion at which the throttle body 65 and the fuel injection valve 62 are arranged is set so as to match and substantially coincide with a forward-rearward length of the opening portion 78 of the helmet 7 7. [0046]<br>
Next; the operation of this working example will be explained.  To the upper side wall of the cylinder head 25 of the engine E swingably supported to the motorcycle body frame 15, the intake system 63 having the fuel injection valve 62 is connected.  The storage box 79 within which the helmet 77 can be stored the opening portion 78 thereof facing downward is fixed to the motorcycle body frame 15 above the intake system 63-  At the bottom wall 79a of the storage box 79, the protruding portion 81 which is to project into the opening portion 78 of the helmet 77 stored within the storage box 79 is protrusively provided so as to be located immediately above the intake system 63 at the portion at which the fuel injection valve 62 is arranged, and form the downward opening concavity portion 82. [0047]<br>
Therefore, a dead space in the helmet 77 stored within the storage box 79 can be used as a relief portion for avoiding an interference with the fuel injection valve 62 and the storage box 79.  It is possible to restrain a substantial reduction in the volume of the storage box 79 while avoiding the interference with the fuel injection valve 62.<br><br>
Also, the intake system 63 is provided with the intake pipe 64 joined to the cylinder head 25, and the fuel injection valve 62 mounted to the intake pipe 64 .  The wall portion 64a which covers the fuel injection valve 62 from the front at the portion located below the concavity portion 81 is integrally provided at the intake pipe 64, so that it is possible to cause the wall portion 64a, which protects the fuel injection valve 62 from the front, to be provided at the intake pipe 64 while avoiding the interference with the storage box 79, and it is possible to prevent foreign material from contacting the fuel injection valve 62 at the time of transport of the intake pipe 64 to which the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted, and at the time of installing of the intake pipe 64 to the cylinder head 25, and protect the fuel injection valve 62. [0049]<br>
Moreover, the mounting seat surface 72 which is provided at the wall portion 64a of the intake pipe 64 in order that the fuel inj ection valve 62 is mounted to the intake pipe 64 is formed in parallel with the flat mounting seat surface 68 which is formed at the downstream end of the intake pipe 64 in order to be joined to the cylinder head 25, so that machining of the mounting seat surface 72 becomes easy and it is possible to contribute to reduction in the manufacturing cost of the intake pipe 64. [0050]<br>
Moreover, the retainer member 73 which is fitted on an apex portion of the fuel injection valve 62 and<br><br>
interposedly holds the fuel injection valve 62 between the retainer member 73 and the intake pipe 64 is fastened to the mounting seat surface 72, so that the intake pipe 64 can be compactly constructed by fixing the fuel injection valve 62 to the intake pipe 64 utilizing the wall portion 64a, while protecting the fuel injection valve 62 from the front by the wall portion 64a.  Moreover, in this working example, the annular step portion 71 which is provided at the intake pipe 64 so as to interposedly hold the fuel injection valve 62 between the annular step portion and the retainer member 73 is also flatly formed in parallel with the junction surface 68, so that the machining of the annular step portion 71 is easy and it is possible to further reduce the manufacturing cost of the intake pipe 64 [0051]<br>
Moreover, the side of the intake pipe further forward than the at least the part of the intake pipe 64 to which the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted, in this working example, the entire intake pipe 64, is formed so as to have a circular arc-shape bulged forwardly and obliquely upward in side view, so that a height of the wall portion formed integrally with the intake pipe forward of the fuel injection valve in order to fasten the retainer member which interposedly holds the fuel injection valve between the retainer member and the intake pipe can be lowered as compared to the case where the wall portion for fastening the retainer member is arranged rearward of the fuel injection valve.<br><br>
Moreover, the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted to the intake pipe 64 with the upper portion thereof projecting into the concavity portion 82 of the storage box 7 9, so that a layout in which a height of the storage box 79 is made low and a height of the rider's seat 80 is suppressed as low as possible can be employed. [0053]<br>
Furthermore, on the vertical line VL passing the center of the pivot 36 provided at the lower portion of the crankcase 23 in the engine E in order to cause the engine E to be swingably supported to the motorcycle body frame 15, the intake pipe 64 is arranged, so that a swinging direction of the intake pipe 64 to which the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted is taken as a substantially forward-rearward direction and a vertical displacement amount of the fuel injection valve 62 can be minimized, thus making it possible to restrain reduction in the volume of the storage box 79. [0054]<br>
Moreover, the forward-rearward length of the protruding portion 81 provided at the bottom wall 79a of the storage box 79 so as to be located immediately above the intake system 63 at the portion at which the throttle body with which the intake system 63 is provided, and the fuel injection valve 62 are arranged, is set so as to match with the forward-rearward length of the opening portion 78 of the helmet 77, so that it is possible to largely form the<br><br>
protruding portion 81 within the range which does not interfere with the storage of the helmet 77, and it is possible to restrain the substantial reduction in the volume of the storage box 79 while avoiding an interference with the bottom wall 79a of the storage box 79, the fuel injection valve 62 and the throttle body 65. [0055]<br>
While the working example of the present invention has been explained above, the present invention is not limited to the working example, and various designs and modifications may be made to the working example without departing from the present invention as set forth in the scope of Claims. [0056]<br>
For example, while the case where the intake pipe 64 constituting the part of the intake system 63 is employed as a member separate from the cylinder head 25 in the working example has been explained above, a case where the fuel injection valve 62 is mounted to the intake pipe integral with the cylinder head is applicable to the present invention.<br>
