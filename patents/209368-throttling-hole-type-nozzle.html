DESCRIPTIOir OF THE IirVByTIOir<br>
Generally an injection nozzle comprises an injection orifice, a no^e foody for providing fuel to the iniection orifice, a means for carrying ftiel fi-om pressure chamber to nozsde body (1), a displaceable nozzle needle extending through the nozsle body (1) for opening and closing the injection orifice and a means to load the nozzle needle (4) in the closing direction and maintains it in its closed position counter to the highest fiiel pressure in the nozzle body (1) and a means for exerting upon the nozzle needle (4) a force counteracting the no^s^ie, closing m^eexi^ whereby the nozzle needle is displaced in the opening direction. The displaceable nossde needle extending througli the nozzle body can open ecsxA close the injection orifice and a means which loads the nozzle needle in tlie closing direction exiA permits a displacement of nozszle needle \xx the opening direction when fiiel pressure in nozzle body is greater than a specific value. The overlap between the nozzle needle second guide and the second guide oxx nozzle body (3) results in throttling fiaw. IXiring this period the fiiel passes through the cross hole. This results in pilot injection.<br>
During pilot injection, a small quantity is injected into combustion chamber.   During the main injection fastest possible opening and closing of<br><br>
noissie needle such tiiat sufficient fiael quantity is injected into combustion chamber within a short time.<br>
A fuel injection valve witli throttle hole type nossziB (9) for direct injection engines, wherein the said injection valve comprising ;-<br>
a nozzle body (1) with a guide bore and a nozzle needle axiaUy guided in said guide bore forming a first guide valve for controlling the injection of fuel into the combustion chamber;<br>
said guide bore extended to form a pressure chaxaber;<br>
said second guide valve formed with a second guide on said nozzle needle axially ^ded in a second guide in said nozsde body for a predetermined overlap axial length with a very narrow annual gap therein, between^ and a cross hole communicating between the said pressure chamber at one end and said guide bore at the other end;<br>
wherein for axial m.ovement of said no^le needle until said second guide on nozzle needle overlaps the said second guide on nozzle body (3), the fuel flows from pressure chamber to guide bore through the said cross hole thus achieving pilot injection.<br>
wherein for further axial movement of said nozzle needle beyond which the said second guide on nozizle needle is not overlapping the second guide on tJie nozzle body (1) the fuel flows from pressure chamber into guide bore, thus achieving main injection.<br>
Hie principle of valve opening is when the fuel pressure acts upon the nozzle needle with an opening force that acts counter to closing force acting on nozzle needle in the direction of noT^le tip^ then nozzle needle is deflected in the<br><br>
direction of pressure chamber aiid as a result the injection vaive opens and fuel is injected into the combustion chamber.<br>
During the waive opening of the throttle nozzle vab/B as per the invention having two guide valves first guide valve opens but second guide valve remains closed as long as moveaaaent of nozzle needle does not exceed the predetemiined overlap stroke. The volume of the pressure chamber decreases upon first guide valve opening but the second giiide valve remaining closed, and thereby the fuel is compressed thereby. Thereafter when the movement of the nozzle needle exceeds the overlap stroke the second guide valve also opens and thus compressed ftiel floivs out of the pressure chamber and the delay in first valve opening thus ceases.<br>
Thus the injector has tlie nozzle needle adapted with the said second guide valve and disposed on the nozzle needle (4), and which opens with a delay after the valve opening up to a predetermined overlap stroke. As such in tile pre injection or pilot injection, only a smaller and defined voiutne of fuel via second guide valve is dispersed into the combustion chamber and thereby opening of injection valve is delayed.<br>
The no^e needle and the second guide are embodied as a single unit comx)rising a single body in the present invention.<br>
The delay of valve opening in the present invention is calculated by means of suitable overlap lengtli measurement of the assembly-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
