ORIGINAL<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: <br>
852/MUMNP/2003<br>
16 JAN 2007<br><br>
__. present invention relates to the compound 4-(2-butylamino)2/7-dimethyl-8-(2-methyl-6-methoxypyrid-3-yl)(l,5-a)-pyrazolo-l/3/5-triazine of formula (I).<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This  invention  relates  to  a  treatment  of psychiatric   disorders   and  neurological   diseases including major depression, anxiety-related disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, supranuclear palsy and feeding disorders as well as treatment of immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases and colonic hypersensitivity  associated  with  psycho-pathological disturbances and stress,  by administration of 4-(2-Butylamino)-2,7-dimethyl-8-{2-methyl-6-methoxypyrid-3-yl)pyrazolo-[1,5-a]-1,3,5-triazine, its enantiomer and pharmaceutically acceptable salts as a corticotropin releasing factor receptor ligand. Background of the Invention<br>
Corticotropin releasing factor (herein referred to as CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide, is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) -derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland [J. Rivier et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 80:4851  (1983);  W.  Vale  et  al.,  Science  213:1394<br><br>
(1981)]. in addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in brain<br>
[W. Vale et al., Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 39:245 (1983); G.F. Koob, Persp. Behav. Med. 2:39 (1985); E.B. De Souza et al., J. Neurosci. 5:3189 (1985)]. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors [J.E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69:1 (1989); J.E. Morley, Life Sci. 41:527 (1987)].<br>
Clinical data provide evidence that CRF has a role in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases including depression, anxiety-related disorders and feeding disorders. A role for CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in the central nervous system [for review see E.B. De Souza, Hosp. Practice 23:59 (1988)].<br><br>
In affective disorder,  or major depression,  the concentration of CRF is significantly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of drug-free individuals [C.B. Nemeroff et al., Science 226:1342 (1984); CM. Banki et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 144:873 (1987); R.D. France et al., Biol. Psychiatry 28:86 (1988); M. Arato et al., Biol Psychiatry 25:355 (1989)]. Furthermore, the density of CRF receptors is significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of suicide victims, consistent with a hypersecretion of CRF [C.B. Nemeroff et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 45:577  (1988)].  In addition,  there is a blunted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) response to CRF (i.v. administered) observed in depressed patients [P.W. Gold et al., Am J. Psychiatry 141:619 (1984); F. Holsboer et al., Psychoneuroendocrinology 9:147 (1984); P.W. Gold et al., New Eng. J. Med. 314:1129 (1986)].   Preclinical studies  in  rats  and  non-human  primates  provide additional   support   for   the   hypothesis   that hypersecretion of CRF may be involved in the symptoms seen in human depression [R.M. Sapolsky, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry  46:1047  (1989)].  There  is  preliminary evidence that tricyclic antidepressants can alter CRF levels and thus modulate the numbers of CRF receptors in<br><br>
brain [Grigoriadis et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 2:53 (1989)] .<br>
It has also been postulated that CRF has a role in the etiology of anxiety-related disorders. CRF produces anxiogenic effects in animals and interactions between benzodiazepine / non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics and CRF have been demonstrated in a variety of behavioral anxiety models [D.R. Britton et al., Life Sci. 31:363 (1982); C.W. Berridge and A.J. Dunn Regul. Peptides 16:83 (1986)]. Preliminary studies using the putative CRF receptor antagonist a-helical ovine CRF (9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms demonstrate that the antagonist produces "anxiolytic-like" effects that are qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines [C.W. Berridge and A.J. Dunn Horm. Behav. 21:393 (1987), Brain Research Reviews 15:71 (1990)].<br>
Neurochemical,  endocrine  and  receptor  binding studies have all demonstrated interactions between CRF and  benzodiazepine  anxiolytics,  providing  further evidence for the involvement of CRF in these disorders. Chlordiazepoxide attenuates the "anxiogenic" effects of CRF in both the conflict test [K.T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 86:170 (1985); K.T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 94:306 (1988)] and in the acoustic<br><br>
startle test [N.R. Swerdlow et al., Psychopharmacology 88:147 (1986)] in rats. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (Rol5-1788), which was without behavioral activity alone in the operant conflict test, reversed the effects of CRF in a dose-dependent manner while the benzodiazepine inverse agonist (FG7142) enhanced the actions of CRF [K.T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 94:306 (1988)] .<br>
The mechanisms and sites of action through which the standard anxiolytics and antidepressants produce their therapeutic effects remain to be elucidated.  It has been hypothesized however, that they are involved in the suppression of the CRF hypersecretion that  is observed in these disorders. Of particular interest is that preliminary studies examining the effects of a CRF receptor antagonist (a-helical CRF9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms have demonstrated that the CRF antagonist    produces    "anxiolytic-like"    effects qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines [for review see G.F.  Koob and K.T.  Britton,  In:  Corticotropin-Releasing Factor:  Basic and Clinical  Studies of a Neuropeptide, E.B. De Souza and C.B. Nemeroff eds., CRC Press p221 (1990)].<br>
It has been further postulated that CRF has a role in cardiovascular or heart-related diseases as well as<br><br>
gastrointestinal disorders arising from stress such as hypertension, tachycardia and congestive heart failure, stroke, irritable bowel syndrome post-operative ileus and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress [for reviews see E.D. DeSouza, C.B. Nemeroff, Editors,- Corticotropin-Releasing Factor: Basic and Clinical Studies of a Neuropeptide, E.B. De Souza and C.B. Nemeroff eds., CRC Press p221 (1990) and C. Maillot, M. Million, J.Y. Wei, A. Gauthier, Y. Tache, Gastroenterology, 119, 1569-1579 (2000)].<br>
Over-expression or under -expression of CRF has been proposed as an underlying cause for several medical disorders.    Such  treatable disorders  include,  for example and without  limitation:  affective disorder, anxiety, depression, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  supranuclear palsy, immune     suppression,     Alzheimer's     disease, gastrointestinal diseases,  anorexia nervosa or other feeding disorder,  drug addiction,  drug or alcohol withdrawal    symptoms,     inflammatory    diseases, cardiovascular  or  heart-related  diseases,  fertility problems,  human  immunodeficiency  virus  infections, hemorrhagic  stress,  obesity,  infertility,  head  and spinal  cord  traumas,   epilepsy,   stroke,   ulcers,<br><br>
amyotrophic    lateral    sclerosis,    hypoglycemia, hypertension, tachycardia and congestive heart failure, stroke,  osteoporosis,  premature  birth,  psychosocial dwarfism, stress-induced fever, ulcer, diarrhea, post¬operative ileus and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress  [for reviews see J.R. McCarthy,  S.C. Heinrichs and D.E. Grigoriadis, Cuur. Pharm. Res., 5, 289-315 (1999); P.J. Gilligan, D.W. Robertson and R. Zaczek, J. Medicinal Chem., 43, 1641-1660 (2000), G. P. Chrousos, Int. J. Obesity, 24, Suppl. 2, S50-S55 (2000); E. Webster, D.J. Torpy,  I.J. Elenkov, G.P. Chrousos, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 840, 21-32 (1998); D.J. Newport and C.B. Nemeroff, Curr.  Opin.  Neurobiology,  10,  211-218  (2000);  G. Mastorakos and I. Ilias, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 900, 95-106 (2000); M.J. Owens and C.B. Nemeroff, Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs, 8, 1849-1858 (1999); G. F. Koob, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 909, 170-185 (2000)].<br>

"Pharmaceutically  acceptable prodrugs"  as  used herein means  any covalently bonded carriers which release the active parent drug of Formula (I) in   vivo when such prodrug  is  administered  to  a mammalian subject.  Prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I) are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals' with  undue  toxicity,  irritation,  allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention.  The term "prodrug" means compounds that are rapidly transformed in  vivo  to<br><br>
yield the parent compound of formula (I), for example by hydrolysis in blood. Functional groups which may be rapidly transformed, by metabolic cleavage, in vivo form a class of groups reactive with the carboxyl group of the compounds of this invention.  They include, but are not limited to such groups as alkanoyl (such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, and the like), unsubstituted and substituted aroyl  (such as benzoyl  and substituted benzoyl),  alkoxycarbonyl  (such  as  ethoxycarbonyl), trialkylsilyl  (such as  trimethyl- and triethysilyl), monoesters  formed with dicarboxylic acids  (such as succinyl), and the like.  Because of the ease with which the metabolically cleavable groups of the compounds useful according to this invention are cleaved in vivo, the compounds bearing such groups act as pro-drugs.  The compounds bearing the metabolically cleavable groups have the advantage that they may exhibit improved bioavailability as a result  of enhanced solubility and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically cleavable group.

"Prodrugs" are considered to be any covalently bonded carriers which release the active parent drug of Formula (I) in vivo  when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject.   Prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I) are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications   are   cleaved,   either   in   routine manipulation or in    vivo,     to the parent compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein hydroxy, amine, or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, amino, or sulfhydryl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of Formula (I), and the like.<br>
As used herein to describe a compound, the term "substantially free of its (S) stereoisomer" means that the compound is made up of a significantly greater proportion of its (R) stereoisomer than of its optical antipode (i.e., its (S) stereoisomer). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the term "substantially free of its (S) stereoisomer" means that the compound is made up of at least about 90% by weight of its (R)<br><br>
stereoisomer and about 10% by weight or less of its (S) stereoisomer'.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the term "substantially free of its (S) stereoisomer" means that the compound is made up of at least about 95% by weight of its (R) stereoisomer and about 5% by weight or less of its (S) stereoisomer. In an even more preferred embodiment, the term "substantially free of its (S) stereoisomer" means that the compound is made up of at least about 99% by weight of its (R) stereoisomer and about 1% or less of its (S) stereoisomer. In another preferred embodiment, the term "substantially free of its (S) stereoisomer" means that the compound is made up of nearly 100% by weight of its (R) stereoisomer. The above percentages are based on the total amount of the combined stereoisomers of the compound.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" of a<br>
compound of this invention means an amount effective to antagonize abnormal level of CRF or treat the symptoms of affective disorder, anxiety or depression in a host.<br>
As used herein, the term "labeled" is meant that the compound is either directly or indirectly labeled with a label which provides a detectable signal, e.g. radioisotope, fluorescers, enzyme, antibodies, particles such as magnetic particles, chemiluminescer, p32 Il31 and At211, etc.<br><br>
Syntheses<br>
Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used  to  denote  the  absolute  configuration  of  the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or ( + ) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given  chemical  structure,  these  compounds,  called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture.<br>
The present invention includes all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of formula I can all independently of one another have S configuration or R configuration. The prefixes d and 1 or ( + ) and {-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with ( + ) or d is dextrorotatory. The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for   example   mixtures   of   enantiomers   and/or<br><br>
diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racetnates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers  in all ratios.  In the case of a cis/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios.  The preparation of individual stereoisomers  can be  carried out,  if  desired,  by separation of a. mixture by customary methods,  for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers.  The  separation  of  a  mixture  of stereoisomers can be carried out at the stage of the compounds of the formula I or at the stage of an intermediate during the synthesis. The present invention also includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I).<br>

Sodium (31.0 g, 1.35 mol) was added portionwise to methanol (500 mL) over 30 min with stirring in a flask equipped with a reflux cindenser.  After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature.   2-Fluoro-6-methylpyridine (50 g, 450 mmol) was added portionwise with stirring.  The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux temperature and stirred for 48 h.   The mix was then cooled to ambient temperature and solvent was removed in vacuo to provide a yellow oil.  The residue was taken up in water (500 mL) and three extractions with ether (200 mL) were performed.  The combined organic layers were dried over MgS04, filtered and solvent was removed in vacuo from the filtrate to give a yellow liquid: 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 3 00 MHz): 8 7.44 (dd, 1H, J = 8, 7), 6.71 (d. 1H, J = 7), 6.53 (d, 1H, J = 8), 3.91 (s, 3H), 2.45 (s, 3H) .

over 16 h.  Acetic acid (37,35 g, 622 mmol), then water<br>
(110 mL)  were added to  the reaction mixture with<br>
stirring.  After 2h, the layers were separated and the<br>
organic layer was concentrated in vacuo.  The residue<br>
was taken up in 2-propanol (750 mL) and solvent was<br>
removed on a rotary evaporator (bath temperature - 50<br>
°C) .   The residue was triturated with ether.   The<br>
product was collected by filtration and dried in vacuo<br>

Utility<br>
Rat CRF Receptor Binding Assay for the Evaluation of Biological Activity.<br>
Receptor binding affinity to rat cortical receptors was assayed according to the published methods (E.B. De Souza, J. Neuroscience, 7: 88 (1987).<br>
Curves of the inhibition of [125I-Tyr0]-o-CRF binding to cell membranes at various dilutions of test drug were analyzed by the iterative curve fitting program LIGAND [P.J. Munson and D. Rodbard, Anal. Biochem. 107:220 (1980), which provides Ki values for inhibition which are then used to assess biological activity. Inhibition of CRF-Stimulated Adenylate Cyclase Activity<br>
Inhibition of CRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity can be performed as described by G. Battaglia et al.'Synapse 1:572 (1987). Briefly, assays are carried out at 37° C for 10 min in 200 ml of buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 37° C) , 10 nM MgCl2,    0.4    mM    EGTA,    0.1%    BSA,    1    mM<br><br>
isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), 250 units/ml phosphocreatine Kinase, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 100 mM guanosine  5'-triphosphate,  100  nM  oCRF,  antagonist<br>
peptides (concentration range 10~9 to 10_6m) and 0.8 mg original wet weight tissue (approximately 40-60 mg protein).  Reactions are initiated by the addition of 1<br>
mM  ATP/32P]ATP  (approximately  2-4  mCi/tube)  and terminated by the addition of 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCL, 45 mM ATP and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  In order to<br>
monitor the recovery of cAMP, 1 ul of [3H]cAMP (approximately 40,000 dpm) is added to each tube prior to separation. The separation of (32p]cAMP from [32p]ATP is performed by sequential elution over Dowex and alumina columns. In vivo Biological Assay<br>
The in vivo activity of a compound of the present invention can be assessed using any one of the biological assays available and accepted within the art. Illustrative of these tests include the Acoustic Startle Assay, the Stair Climbing Test, and the Chronic Administration Assay.
