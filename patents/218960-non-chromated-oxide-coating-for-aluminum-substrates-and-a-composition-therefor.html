FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This environmental-quality invention is in the field of chemical conversion oatings formed on aluminum and aluminum alloy substrates. One aspect of the nvention is an improved process of forming an oxide coating, referred to as a "cobalt onversion coating," that is chemically formed by oxidizing the surface of an luminum or aluminum alloy substrate. The invention enhances the quality of the nvironment of mankind by contributing to the maintenance of air and water quality, "he term "aluminum" as used herein includes aluminum and aluminum alloys.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Reference is made to the following patents, which are incorporated by jference herein: U.S. Patent 5,298,092, issued March 29, 1994; U.S. Patent ,415,687, issued May 16, 1995; U.S. Patent 5,472,524, issued December 5, 1995; r.S. Patent 5,487,949, issued January 30, 1996; U.S. Patent 5,378,293, issued muary 3, 1995; U.S. Patent 5,411,606, issued May 2, 1995; U.S. Patent 5,551,994, sued September 3, 1996; and U.S. Patent 5,873,953, issued February 23, 1999.<br>
Recently, I have made significant improvements to this technology to further nprove bath life and bath stability as well as coating performance characteristics, he details are described below.<br>
Environmental regulations in the United States are mandating drastic iductions of allowed chromium compounds in effluent as well as emissions into the r which are generated fi-om metal finishing processes. I have devoted considerable fort to the development of a non-chromated surface coating as a replacement for<br><br>
current chromated processes as detailed in MIL-C-5514 and Boeing Process Specification BAC 5719.<br>
Chromium containing conversion coatings are used by The Boeing Company, its subcontractor base and generally throughout the industry. Solutions used to 5     produce these conversion coatings contain carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, fluorides, and cyanides, all of which present a significant environmental, health, and safety problem. The constituents of a typical chromate conversion-coating bath are as follows: CrOa "chromic acid" (hexavalent); NaF sodium fluoride; KF4B potassium tetrafluoborate; K2ZrF6 potassium hexafluorozirconate; K3Fe(CN)6 potassium 10     ferricyanide; and HNO3 nitric acid.<br>
Current chromium conversion films are deposited by immersion, meet a 168-hour corrosion resistance requirement when tested to ASTM Bl 17, but also serve as a surface substrate to promote paint adhesion. Typical coating weights of these chromium films range from 40 to 120 mg/ft^ and do not cause a fatigue life reduction 15     of the aluminum substrate.<br>

Furthermore, practical bath lives were still found to be marginal. With ammoniated cobalt complexes, it was always the excess of ammonium hydroxide (ammonia) which 25     functioned as the bath accelerator. In the case of nitrite complexes, iodides, such as Nal, or triethanolamine were used as accelerators, and with acetate/formate complexes, either fluorides or the ammonium ion were the accelerators. A universal and much more effective bath accelerator has now been discovered and has been successfiilly used with all prior cobalt complexing solutions. This most preferred bath 30     accelerator is sodium chlorate, NaClOa. Sodium chlorate is effective when used in<br><br>
conjunction with positive cobalt ligand complexes and it was found to be especially<br>
effective when used in conjunction with negative cobalt ligand complexes, i.e.:<br>
Mea [Co(N02)6] where NO2 = nitrite and Me = Na, K, Li,<br>
or       Mes [Co(Ac)6] where Ac = acetate,<br>
5	or       Me3 [Co(Fm)6] where Fm = formate.<br>
Use of sodium chlorate, NaClOs, as bath accelerator has resulted in the following significant process improvements:<br>
1.   Practical bath life in excess of 6 months (now usable for<br>
commercial     production),<br>
10	2,   Added bath stability and performance consistency.<br>
3.	Consistent salt spray corrosion resistance performance.<br>
4.	Bath control simplification, i.e., daily pH analysis no longer required.<br>
5.	The post conversion treatment using the V205/Na2W04 solution is<br>
15                          effective	at room temperature and no longer requires heating<br>
when the accelerator is added. The sodium chlorate accelerator was successfully used with all prior disclosed cobalt complexes utilized for conversion coating formation. However, the cobalt nitrite complexing chemistry described in U.S. Patent 5,472,524, which is 20     incorporated by reference herein, is suitable for production because of bath simplicity and effectiveness in corrosion resistance of the cobalt conversion coating.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Note: The above make-up represents chemical quantities which yield optimum processing results, however, coating formation is not limited to these parameters.<br>
Coatings are subsequently treated or sealed with a post treatment solution as 5     described in U.S. Patent 5,873,953, which is incorporated by reference herein, using the V20s/Na2WO4 solution. When NaClOa is added to this post treatment, the solution becomes effective at room temperature.<br><br><br>
BATH AND PROCESS PARAMETERS<br>
Cobalt Conversion Solution:<br>
5	The following bath make-up sequence was established and found important in<br>
achieving consistent, reproducible reaction products:<br>
1.	Fill tank (having an inert liner such as Neoprene or preferably a stainless<br>
steel tank) to 2/3 with deionized water. Begin air sparging to a gentle roll.<br>
2.	Add and dissolve the required chemicals in the following order:<br>
10	Cobalt nitrate<br>
Sodium nitrite Sodium chlorate<br>
3.	Fill the tank to the required level with water and let the solution react for a<br>
minimum of 8 hours.<br>
15	4. Heat the tank to 120-140°F (120°F is preferred for longer bath life and<br>
bath stability) and maintain. The solution is now ready for operation. Post Treatment Solution:<br>
The following bath make-up sequence for the post treatment has been established. It is also important to add the required chemicals in the sequence below:<br><br><br><br>
EFFECTIVENESS<br>
The eflFectiveness of the NaClOs accelerator was evaluated with coating<br>
formulations other than Examples 1, 2, and 3, using positive ligand complexes, i.e.,<br>
Co(NH3)6X3   where X = CI, NO3, SO4, or CN.<br>
5	Negative ligand chemistry proved to be simpler and required less chemical<br>
control with respect to pH control, and also ammonia use and replenishment is not an issue. It was found that, in principle, any water soluble cobalt salt may be used for complexing in conjunction with sodium chlorate accelerator. Cobalt chloride, acetate, sulfate, formate, and nitrate are all usable with varying degrees of efficiency and 10     NaClOa accelerator quantities vary when used with these formulations. For positive ligands, where the ammonium ion is used for cobalt complexing, it is still important to use the associated ammonium salt in conjunction with the cobalt salt, ammonium hydroxide (ammonia) complexer, and the accelerator. As described in U.S. Patent 5,487,949, which is incorporated by reference herein, this is important in order to 15     prevent precipitation of the freshly formed cobalt complex, by suppressing the hydroxyl ion concentration.<br>
Regarding the use of sodium chlorate, other accelerator compounds belonging<br>
in the same chemical grouping were identified. These are NaC102, NaC104, NaBrOa,<br>
andNalOa.<br>
20	NaCIOi was found to be too aggressive, resulting in pitting of the aluminum<br>
substrate during coating formation. NaC104 was not used because of extreme<br>
reactivity and danger of explosion. NaBrOj and NalOj were found to be usable,<br>
however with decreased efficiency. The potassium salts of these compounds were not<br>
used, since potassium compounds have a tendency to drop cobalt out of solution.<br>
25	OTHER METHODS OF APPLICATION<br>
The above formulations illustrate producing cobalt conversion coatings by immersion application. The same principles apply to producing the conversion coating by manual application and by spray application.<br>
The patents, specifications, and other publications referenced above are 30     incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
