c)	Address	: ARDSLEY PARK<br>
42 0 SAW MILL RIVER ROAD ARDSLEY, NY 10502 U.S.A.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This invention claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/564,801, filed April 23, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to processes for alkylating phosphorus-containing compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to processes for alkylating phosphorus-containing compounds possessing at least one phosphorus-hydrogen<br><br>
alkylatable site to provide an alkylated phosphorus-containing product, e.g., a mono- or dialkylphosphinic acid or metal salt thereof, an alkylarylphosphinic acid or metal salt thereof, an alkyl alkylphosphonic acid or metal salt thereof, an alkyl or aryl dialkylphosphinate ester, an alkyl or aryl alkylarylphosphmate ester, an alkyl or arylalkylphosphorous acid or metal salt thereof or a dialkyl or diaryl alkylphosphonate ester.<br>
In order to prepare dialkylphosphinic acid derivatives, a complex synthesis route has been used which includes the hydrolysis of methyldichlorophosphine to provide methylphosphinic acid and the subsequent esterification of this acid to provide an alkyl methylphosphinic ester. The second phosphorus-hydrogen bond can also be alkylated in the presence of a free-radical initiator.<br>
The use of dialkylphosphinic acid derivatives as flame retardants for polyesters (poly(ethylene  terephthalate)  and  poly(butylene  terephthalate))  is  described in<br><br>
European Patent Publication No. 699,708. These products are synthesized by a complex process using methyldichlorophosphine which is hydrolyzed to methylphosphinic acid; the ester of this acid has been prepared and isolated as intermediate. To prepare dialkylphosphinic acids or derivatives thereof, alkylphosphinic esters can be alkylated by a-olefms at high temperatures under free-radical catalysis conditions. In the case of the reaction of alkylphosphinic acids under the same conditions, only the disproportionation products, namely, alkylphosphines and alkylphosphonic acids, are obtained while under mild conditions no reaction is observed.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,632,741 describes a process for preparing mixtures of salts of alkylphosphinic and dialkylphosphinic acids by reacting an olefin with a salt of hypophosphorous acid in the presence of a photoinitiator using UV light. U.S. Patent No. 4,590,014 describes a similar process in which the olefin is reacted with the alkali metal salt of hypophosphorous acid in the presence of a free-radical initiator. However, the predominant product monoalkylphosphinic acid.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,300,516 describes a process for preparing dialkylphosphinic acids and/or alkali metal salts thereof by reacting olefins, particularly ethylene, with alkylphosphinic acid or hypophosphorous acid in the presence of azo free-radical initiator. This process is performed in a pressurized reactor with complicated feeding systems which require special safety features. Only high boiling olefins can be reacted with hypophosphorous acid at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The reaction of hypophosphorous acid with isobutene was reported in the literature (S. Deprele and J-L. Montchamp, J.'Org Chem. 2001, 66, 6745). The reaction was run in the presence of a stochiometric amount of triethyl borane as initiator. The yield of monosubstituted isobutylphosphinic acid was only 38%.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is  an object of the  invention to  provide  a  process for  the  alkylation of<br>
phosphorous-containing compounds possessing at least one phosphorus-hydrogen<br><br>
alkylatable site.<br>
It is a particular object of the present invention to provide such a process employing as alkylating agents short chain alkyls which result within a relatively short time in a high yield of the desired alkylated product while avoiding the aforenoted disadvantages associates with the known processes discussed above.<br>
These and other objects of the invention are achieved by the process of alkylation herein which comprises alkylating phosphorous-containing compound possessing at least one phosphorus-hydrogen<br><br>
alkylatable site with reactant which generates alkene and/or cycloalkene alkylating agent in situ in the presence of free radical initiator, the alkene and/or cycloalkene alkylating agent alkylating the phosphorus-containing compound to provide alkylated phosphorus- containing product.<br>
Without intending to be bound, it is thought that the reactant which generates alkene or cycloalkene in situ under alkylation conditions produces a sufficient concentration of these compounds that will result in alkylation of the at least one phosphorus-hydrogen alkylatable site present in the starting organophosphorous-containing compound  and  as  the  alkenes/cycloalkenes  are consumed in the<br><br>
alkylation   reaction,   the   equilibrium   shifts   towards   generation   of  additional alkenes/cycloalkenes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

The dialkylphosphinic acids and/or alkali metal salts thereof obtained by the above-described process are also used as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry. The process of the invention is illustrated by the examples which follow.<br><br>
Example 1 Into a 250 ml three-necked flask equipped with condenser, addition funnel, magnetic stirrer and thermometer were charged 47.79 g (0.362 mol) 50% commercial hypophosphorous acid, 45.94 g (0.395 mol) tert-butyl acetate and 3.2 g AIBN. The reaction mixture was heated to 61°C and stirred for 3 hours. Thereafter, a second portion of 8.7g AIBN in acetic acid solution was gradually added while the temperature of the reaction mixture was slowly raised to 84°C over the course of 11 hours. After addition was complete, 31P NMR analysis indicated the formation of 8% di-isobutylphosphinic acid, 63% isobutylphosphinic and 29% hypophosphorus acid. The reaction mixture was either neutralized by aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and then treated with aqueous aluminum hydroxide or directly reacted with aluminum oxide. The resulting white precipitate was filtered out, washed with water and dried in an oven thus providing 23 g aluminum salt of isobutylphosphinic acid. The mother liquor can, if desired, be recycled and used for preparing another quantity of product.<br>
Example 2 Into a 500 ml three-necked flask equipped with condenser, addition funnel, magnetic stirrer and thermometer were charged 65.80 g (0.498 mol) 50% commercial hypophosphorous acid and 79.92 g (1.08 mol) tert-butyl alcohol. The reaction mixture was heated to 70°C and addition of 2.06 g AIBN in 35 g acetic acid solution begun. After 6 hours, the addition was complete. The mixture contained 50% isobutylphosphinic acid and 50% hypophosphorus acid as determined by 31P NMR. The mixture was treated with a second portion of 5.5 g AIBN and 5.7 g t-butyl peroxybenzoate in acetic acid while the temperature was gradually increased to 970C over the course of 10 hours. After addition was complete, the mixture was found to contain 75% di-isobutylphosphinic acid, 20% isobutylphosphinic acid and 5% isobutylphosphonic acid. The mixture was dried in a rotavapor under vacuum at 75°C to remove water and solvent and washed with warm water three times. The<br><br>
upper oily phase was separated and dried in a rotavapor under vacuum at 75°C 57.5 g. The oily material was collected and crystallized at room temperature. The yield based on hypophosphorous acid was 65% without recycling the mother liquid. The mother liquid can, if desired, be recycled and used for preparing another quantity of product.<br>
Example 3 Into a 2L four-necked flask equipped with condenser, addition funnel, mechanical stirrer and thermometer were charged 32135 g (3.03 mol) sodium hypophosphite monohydrate and 637 g acetic acid. Afterthe solution became clear, 149.33 g sulfuric acid was gradually added to the mixture and a slurry was observed. A solution comprised of 458.18 g (6.186 mol) tert-butanol, 107.85 g acetic acid and 18.63 g (0.13 mol) di-tert- butyl peroxide was slowly added at a temperature of from 104 to 110°C over 14.5 hours. Analysis of the mixture by 31P NMR showed it to contain 58 mol % diisobutylphosphinic acid and 42 mol % monoisobutylphosphinic acid. There was no measurable amount of hypophosphorus acid as determined by 31P NMR analysis. A portion of the solvent was then removed. Another solution comprising 98.80 g (1.33 mol) tert-butanol, 5.87 g (0.040 mol) di-tert-butyl peroxide and 23.7 g acetic acid was added to the reaction mixture at a temperature of from 103 to 111°C over 7 hours. 31P NMR analysis indicated a mixture of 73% diisobutylphosphinic acid and 25% monoisobutylphosphinic acid with the remainder made up of monoisobutylphosphonate acid and phosphorus acid.<br>
Example 4 The alkylated product mixture obtained in Example 3, supra, was filtered and the solvents were stripped out in a rotavapor under vacuum. The liquid mixture was then consecutively washed with 200 mL water, 200 mL 2.7% sodium carbonate three times and 200 mL water twice. The upper layer was separated and dried in a Rotavapor under vacuum. The material crystallized upon standing at room temperature to provide 350 g pure diisobutylphosphinic acid. The yield was 65%.<br><br>
Example 5 A portion of the above pure diisobutylphosphinic acid (135.01 g, 0.758 mol) was mixed with water and neutralized with dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The neutralized product was then mixed with a solution of 61.83 g (0.256 mol) A1C13 6H20 in 2 L water. A large amount of white precipitate was observed. The precipitate was filtered and dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105°C. A white powder, aluminum salt of diisobutylphosphinic acid, of 139.43 g was obtained. The yield was 98.9%.<br>
Example 6 Into a IL four-necked flask equipped with condenser, addition funnel, mechanical stirrer and thermometer were charged 187*52 g (1.77 mol) sodium hypophosphite monohydrate and 294 g acetic acid.

A solution comprised of 150.81 g (2.03 mol) tert-butanol, 16.97 g acetic acid and 6.35 g (0.043 mol) di-tert-butyl peroxide was slowly added at a temperature range of from 111 to 118°C over 6 hours. Analysis of the mixture by 31P NMR showed the mixture to consist of 13 mol% diisobutylphosphinic acid, 72 mol % monoisobutylphosphinic acid and 13% hyposphosphorus acid. Another solution comprising 156.577 g (2.11 mol) tert-butanol, 11.86 g di-tert-butyl peroxide (0.081 mol) and 160.29 g acetic anhydride was then added to the reaction mixture at a temperature of 104 to 111°C over 14.5 hours while 13.71 g sulfuric acid was added from a second funnel. A mixture of 87.5% diisobutylphosphinic acid, 9.5% monoisobutylphosphinic acid, 1.6% monoisobutylphosphonic acid and 1.4% phosphorus acid was obtained.<br>
Example 7 The alkylated product mixture obtained in Example 6, supra, was first filtered and then stripped in a Rotavapor at a bath temperature of 100°C A solution of 302 g was obtained. Part of this solution (233 g, total 1.37 mol P) was neutralized with diluted<br><br>
sodium hydroxide and added to 2.5 L 4% aqueous aluminum chloride (0.435 mol A1C13 6H20). The resulting white precipitate was filtered and dried in an oven at 750C overnight. 214 g of white powder, aluminum salts of diisobutylphinic acid, monoisobutylphosphinic acid and monoisobutylphosphonic acid, was obtained.<br>
Example 8 Into a 2L four-necked flask equipped with condenser, addition funnel, mechanical stirrer and thermometer were charged 211.76 g (2.00 mol) sodium hypophosphite monohydrate and 317 g acetic acid. After the solution became clear, 106.97 g sulfuric acid was gradually added to the mixture and a slurry was observed. The mixture was then heated to 120°C. A solution comprised of 243.19 g (2.09 mol) tert-butyl acetate and 7.35 g (0.050 mol) di-tert-butyl peroxide was slowly added at a temperature of 115 to 1200C over 5 hours. Analysis of the mixture by 31P NMR showed the mixture contained 11 mol % diisobutylphosphinic acid, 72 mol % monoisobutylphosphinic acid and 17 mol % hypophosphorus acid. A further 20.12 g sulfuric acid was added. Another solution comprising 310.73 g (2.68 mol) tert-butyl acetate and 13.10 g (0.090 mol) di-tert-butyl peroxide was added to the reaction mixture at a temperature of 114 to 1200C over 10 hours. 31P NMR analysis indicated the mixture to contain 88% diisobutylphosphinic acid and 10% monoisobutylphosphinic acid with the remainder made up of monoisobutylphosphonate acid and phosphorus acid.<br>
Example 9 The alkylated product mixture obtained in Example 8, supra, was filtered and the solvents were stripped out in a rotavapor under vacuum.
