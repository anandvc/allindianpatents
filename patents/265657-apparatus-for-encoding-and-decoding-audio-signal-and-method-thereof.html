APPARATUS FOR ENCODING AND DECODING AUDIO SIGNAL AND<br>
METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The subject matter of this application is generally-<br>
related audio signal processing.<br>
Background Art<br>
Efforts are underway to research and develop new<br>
approaches to perceptual coding of multi-channel audio,<br>
commonly referred to as Spatial Audio Coding (SAC). SAC allows<br>
transmission of multi-channel audio at low bit rates, making<br>
SAC suitable for many popular audio applications (e.g.,<br>
Internet streaming, music downloads) .<br>
Rather than performing a discrete coding of individual<br>
audio input channels, SAC captures the spatial image of a<br>
multi-channel audio signal in a compact set of parameters. The<br>
parameters can be transmitted to a decoder where the parameters<br>
are used to synthesis or reconstruct the spatial properties of<br>
the audio signal.<br>
In some SAC applications, the spatial parameters are<br>
transmitted to a decoder as part of a bitstream. The bitstream<br>
includes spatial frames that contain ordered sets of time slots<br>
1<br><br>
for which spatial parameter sets can be applied. The bitstream<br>
also includes position information that can be used by a<br>
decoder to identify the correct time slot for which a given<br>
parameter set is applied.<br>
Some SAC applications make use of conceptual elements in<br>
the encoding/decoding paths. One element is commonly referred<br>
to as One-To-Two (OTT) and another element is commonly referred<br>
to as Two-To-Three (TTT), where the names imply the number of<br>
input and output channels of a corresponding decoder element,<br>
respectively. The OTT encoder element extracts two spatial<br>
parameters and creates a downmix signal and residual signal.<br>
The TTT element mixes down three audio signals into a stereo<br>
downmix signal plus a residual signal. These elements can be<br>
combined to provide a variety of configurations of a spatial<br>
audio environment (e.g., surround sound).<br>
Some SAC applications can operate in a non-guided<br>
operation mode, where only a stereo downmix signal is<br>
transmitted from an encoder to a decoder without a need for<br>
spatial parameter transmission. The decoder synthesizes<br>
spatial parameters from the downmix signal and uses those<br>
parameters to produce a multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Spatial information associated with an audio signal is<br>
2<br><br>
encoded into a bitstream, which can be transmitted to a decoder<br>
or recorded to a storage media. The bitstream can include<br>
different syntax related to time, frequency and spatial domains.<br>
In some embodiments, the bitstream includes one or more data<br>
structures (e.g., frames) that contain ordered sets of slots<br>
for which parameters can be applied. The data structures can<br>
be fixed or variable. A data structure type indicator can be<br>
inserted in the bitstream to enable a decoder to determine the<br>
data structure type and to invoke an appropriate decoding<br>
process. The data structure can include position information<br>
that can be used by a decoder to identify the correct slot for<br>
which a given parameter set is applied. The slot position<br>
information can be encoded with either a fixed number of bits<br>
or a variable number of bits based on the data structure type<br>
as indicated by the data structure type indicator. For<br>
variable data structure types, the slot position information<br>
can be encoded with a variable number of bits based on the<br>
position of the slot in the ordered set of slots.<br>
In some implementations, a method of encoding an audio<br>
signal includes: determining a number of time slots and a<br>
number of parameter sets, the parameter sets including one or<br>
more parameters; generating information indicating a position<br>
of at least one time slot in an ordered set of time slots to<br>
which a parameter set is applied; encoding the audio signal as<br>
3<br><br>
a bitstream including a frame, the frame including the ordered<br>
set of time slots; and inserting a variable number of bits in<br>
the bitstream that represent the position of the time slot in<br>
the ordered set of time slots, wherein the variable number of<br>
bits is determined by the time slot position.<br>
In some embodiments, a method of decoding an audio signal<br>
includes: receiving a bitstream representing an audio signal,<br>
the bitstream having a frame; determining a number of time<br>
slots and a number of parameter sets from the bitstream, the<br>
parameter sets including one or more parameters; determining<br>
position information from the bitstream, the position<br>
information indicating a position of a time slot in an ordered<br>
set of time slots to which the parameter set is applied, where<br>
the ordered set of time slots is included in the frame; and<br>
decoding the audio signal based on the number of time slots,<br>
the number of parameter sets and the position information,<br>
wherein the position information is represented by a variable<br>
number of bits based on the time slot position.<br>
Other embodiments of time slot position coding are<br>
disclosed that are directed to systems, methods, apparatuses,<br>
data structures and computer-readable mediums.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a principle of<br>
generating spatial information according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Perceptual coding schemes for multi-<br>
channel audio signals are based on a fact that humans can<br>
perceive audio signals through three dimensional space. The<br>
three dimensional space of an audio signal can be represented<br>
using spatial information, including but not limited to the<br>
following known spatial parameters: Channel Level Differences<br>
(CLD), Inter-channel Correlation/Coherence (ICC), Channel Time<br>
Difference (CTD) , Channel Prediction Coefficients (CPC), etc.<br>
8<br><br>
The CLD parameter describes the energy (level) differences<br>
between two audio channels, the ICC parameter describes the<br>
amount of correlation or coherence between two audio channels<br>
and the CTD parameter describes the time difference between two<br>
audio channels.<br>
The generation of CTD and CLD parameters is illustrated<br>
in FIG. 1. A first direct sound wave 103 from a remote sound<br>
source 101 arrives at a left human ear 107 and a second direct<br>
sound wave 102 is diffracted around a human head to reach a<br>
right human ear 10 6. The direct sound waves 102 and 103 differ<br>
from each other in arrival time and energy level. CTD and CLD<br>
parameters can be generated based on the arrival time and<br>
energy level differences of the sound waves 102 and 103,<br>
respectively. In addition, reflected sound waves 104 and 105<br>
arrive at ears 106 and 107, respectively, and have no mutual<br>
correlations. An ICC parameter can be generated based on the<br>
correlation between the sound waves 104 and 105.<br>
At the encoder, spatial information (e.g., spatial<br>
parameters) are extracted from a multi-channel audio input<br>
signal and a downmix signal is generated. The downmix signal<br>
and spatial parameters are transferred to a decoder. Any<br>
number of audio channels can be used for the downmix signal,<br>
including but not limited to: a mono signal, a stereo signal<br>
or a multi-channel audio signal. At the decoder, a multi-<br>
9<br><br>
channel up-mix signal is created from the downmix signal and<br>
the spatial parameters.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an encoder for encoding an<br>
audio signal according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The encoder includes a downmixing unit 202, a<br>
spatial information generating unit 203, a downmix signal<br>
encoding unit 207 and a multiplexing unit 209. Other<br>
configurations of an encoder are possible. Encoders can be<br>
implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both<br>
hardware and software. Encoders can be implemented in<br>
integrated circuit chips, chip sets, system on a chip (SoC),<br>
digital signal processors, general purpose processors and<br>
various digital and analog devices.<br>
The downmixing unit 202 generates a downmix signal 204<br>
from the multi-channel audio signal 201. In FIG. 2, Xi,...,xn<br>
indicate input audio channels. As mentioned previously, the<br>
downmix signal 204 can be a mono' signal, a stereo signal or a<br>
multi-channel audio signal. In the example shown, x'i,...,x'm<br>
indicate channel numbers of the downmix signal 204. In some<br>
embodiments, the encoder processes an externally provided<br>
downmix signal 205 (e.g., an artistic downmix) instead of the<br>
downmix signal 204.<br>
The spatial information generating unit 203 extracts<br>
spatial information from the multi-channel audio signal 201. In<br>
10<br><br>
this case, "spatial information" means information relating to<br>
the audio signal channels used in upmixing the downmix signal<br>
204 to a multi-channel audio signal in the decoder. The<br>
downmix signal 204 is generated by downmixing the multi-channel<br>
audio.signal. The spatial information is encoded to provide an<br>
encoded spatial information signal 206.<br>
The downmix signal encoding unit 207 generates an encoded<br>
downmix signal 208 by encoding the downmix signal 204 generated<br>
from the downmixing unit 202.<br>
The multiplexing unit 209 generates a bitstream 210<br>
including the encoded downmix signal 208 and the encoded<br>
spatial information signal 206. The bitstream 210 can be<br>
transferred to a downstream decoder and/or recorded on a<br>
storage media.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a decoder for decoding an<br>
encoded audio signal according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The decoder includes a demultiplexing unit 302, a<br>
downmix signal decoding unit 305, a spatial information<br>
decoding unit 307 and an upmixing unit 309. Decoders can be<br>
implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both<br>
hardware and software. Decoders can be implemented in<br>
integrated circuit chips, chip sets, system on a chip (SoC),<br>
digital signal processors, general purpose processors and<br>
various digital and analog devices.<br>
11<br><br>
In some embodiments, the demultiplexing unit 302 receives<br>
a bitstream 301 representing an audio signal and then separates<br>
an encoded downmix signal 303 and an encoded spatial<br>
information signal 304 from the bitstream 301. In FIG. 3,<br>
x'i,...,x'm indicate channels of the downmix signal 303. The<br>
downmix signal decoding unit 305 outputs a decoded downmix<br>
signal 306 by decoding the encoded downmix signal 303. If the<br>
decoder is unable to output a multi-channel audio signal, the<br>
downmix signal decoding unit 305 can directly output the<br>
downmix signal 306. In FIG. 3, y'i,-,y'm indicate direct<br>
output channels of the downmix signal decoding unit 305.<br>
The spatial information signal decoding unit 307 extracts<br>
configuration information of the spatial information signal<br>
from the encoded spatial information signal 304 and then<br>
decodes the spatial information signal 304 using the extracted<br>
configuration information.<br>
The upmixing unit 309 can up mix the downmix signal 306<br>
into a multi-channel audio signal 310 using the extracted<br>
spatial information 308. In FIG. 3, yi,...,yn indicate a number<br>
of output channels of the upmixing unit 309.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a channel converting module<br>
which can be included in the upmixing unit 309 of the decoder<br>
shown in FIG. 3. In some embodiments, the upmixing unit 309<br>
can include a plurality of channel converting modules. The<br>
12<br><br>
channel converting module is a conceptual device that can<br>
differentiate a number of input channels and a number of output<br>
channels from each other using specific information.<br>
In some embodiments, the channel converting module can<br>
include an OTT (one-to-two) box for converting one channel to<br>
two channels and vice versa, and a TTT (two-to-three) box for<br>
converting two channels to three channels and vice versa. The<br>
OTT and/or TTT boxes can be arranged in a variety of useful<br>
configurations. For example, the upmixing unit 309 shown in<br>
FIG. 3 can include a 5-1-5 configuration, a 5-2-5 configuration,<br>
a 7-2-7 configuration, a 7-5-7 configuration, etc. In a 5-1-5<br>
configuration, a downmix signal having one channel is generated<br>
by downmixing five channels to a one channel, which can then be<br>
upmixed to five channels. Other configurations can be created<br>
in the same manner using various combinations of OTT and TTT<br>
boxes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, an exemplary 5-2-5 configuration for<br>
an upmixing unit 400 is shown. In a 5-2-5 configuration, a<br>
downmix signal 401 having two channels is input to the upmixing<br>
unit 400. In the example shown, a left channel (L) and a right<br>
channel (R) are provided as input into the upmixing unit 400.<br>
In this embodiment, the upmixing unit 400 includes one TTT box<br>
402 and three OTT boxes 406, 407 and 408. The downmix signal<br>
401 having two channels is provided as input to the TTT box<br>
13<br><br>
(TTTo) 402, which processes the downmix signal 401 and provides<br>
as output three channels 403, 404 and 405. One or more spatial<br>
parameters (e.g., CPC, CLD, ICC) can be provided as input to<br>
the TTT box 402, and are used to process the downmix signal 401,<br>
as described below. In some embodiments, a residual signal can<br>
be selectively provided as input to the TTT box 402. In such a<br>
case, the CPC can be described as a prediction coefficient for<br>
generating three channels from two channels.<br>
The channel 403 that is provided as output from TTT box<br>
402 is provided as input to OTT box 406 which generates two<br>
output channels using one or more spatial parameters. In the<br>
example shown, the two output channels represent front left<br>
(FL) and backward left (BL) speaker positions in, for example,<br>
a surround sound environment. The channel 404 is provided as<br>
input to OTT box 407, which generates two output channels using<br>
one or more spatial parameters. In the example shown, the two<br>
output channels represent front right (FR) and back right (BR)<br>
speaker positions. The channel 405 is provided as input to OTT<br>
box 408, which generates two output channels. In the example<br>
shown, the two output channels represent a center (C) speaker<br>
position and low frequency enhancement (LFE) channel. In this<br>
case, spatial information (e.g., CLD, ICC) can be provided as<br>
input to each of the OTT boxes. In some embodiments, residual<br>
signals ( Resl, Res2) can be provided as inputs to the OTT<br>
14<br><br>
boxes 406 and 407. In such an embodiment, a residual signal<br>
may not be provided as input to the OTT box 408 that outputs a<br>
center channel and an LFE channel.<br>
The configuration shown in FIG. 4 is an example of a<br>
configuration for a channel converting module. Other<br>
configurations for a channel converting module are possible,<br>
including various combinations of OTT and TTT boxes. Since<br>
each of the channel converting modules can operate in a<br>
frequency domain, a number of parameter bands applied to each<br>
of the channel converting modules can be defined. A parameter<br>
band means at least one frequency band applicable to one<br>
parameter. The number of parameter bands is described in<br>
reference to FIG. 6B.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a method of configuring<br>
a bitstream of an audio signal according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. FIG. 5(a) illustrates a bitstream of an<br>
audio signal including a spatial information signal only, and<br>
FIGS. 5(b) and 5(c) illustrate a bitstream of an audio signal<br>
including a downmix signal and a spatial'information signal.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5(a), a bitstream of an audio signal<br>
can include configuration information 501 and a frame 503. The<br>
frame 503 can be repeated in the bitstream and in some<br>
embodiments includes a single spatial frame 502 containing<br>
spatial audio information.<br>
15<br><br>
In some embodiments, the configuration information 501<br>
includes information describing a total number of time slots<br>
within one spatial frame 502, a total number of parameter bands<br>
spanning a frequency range of the audio signal, a number of<br>
parameter bands in an OTT box, a number of parameter bands in a<br>
TTT box and a number of parameter bands in a residual signal.<br>
Other information can be included in the configuration<br>
information 501 as desired.<br>
In some embodiments, the spatial frame 502 includes one<br>
or more spatial parameters (e.g., CLD, ICC), a frame type, a<br>
number of parameter sets within one frame and time slots to<br>
which parameter sets can be applied. Other information can be<br>
included in the spatial frame 502 as desired. The meaning and<br>
usage of the configuration information 501 and the information<br>
contained in the spatial frame 502 will be explained in<br>
reference to FIGS. 6 to 10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5(b), a bitstream of an audio signal<br>
may include configuration information 504, a downmix signal 505<br>
and a spatial frame 506. In this case, one frame 507 can<br>
include the downmix signal 505 and the spatial frame 506, and<br>
the frame 507 may be repeated in the bitstream.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5(c), a bitstream of an audio signal<br>
may include a downmix signal 508, configuration information 509<br>
and a spatial frame 510. In this case, one frame 511 can<br>
16<br><br>
include the configuration information 509 and the spatial frame<br>
510, and the frame 511 may be repeated in the bitstream. If<br>
the configuration information 509 is inserted in each frame 511,<br>
the audio signal can be played back by a playback device at an<br>
arbitrary position.<br>
Although FIG. 5(c) illustrates that the configuration<br>
information 509 is inserted in the bitstream by frame 511, it<br>
should be apparent that the configuration information 509 can<br>
be inserted in the bitstream by a plurality of frames which<br>
repeat periodically or non-periodically.<br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B are diagrams illustrating relations<br>
between a parameter set, time slot and parameter bands<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
parameter set means a one or more spatial parameters applied to<br>
one time slot. The spatial parameters can include spatial<br>
information, such as CDL, ICC, CPC, etc. A time slot means a<br>
time interval of an audio signal to which spatial parameters<br>
can be applied. One spatial frame can include one or more time<br>
slots.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6A, a number of parameter sets 1,...,P<br>
can be used in a spatial frame, and each parameter set can<br>
include one or more data fields 1,...,Q-1. A parameter set can<br>
be applied to an entire frequency range of an audio signal, and<br>
each spatial parameter in the parameter set can be applied to<br>
17<br><br>
one or more portions of the frequency band. For example, if a<br>
parameter set includes 20 spatial parameters, the entire<br>
frequency band of an audio signal can be divided into 20 zones<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "parameter bands") and the 20<br>
spatial parameters of the parameter set can be applied to the<br>
20 parameter bands. The parameters can be applied to the<br>
parameter bands as desired. For example, the spatial<br>
parameters can be densely applied to low frequency parameter<br>
bands and sparsely applied to high frequency parameter bands.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6B, a time/frequency graph shows the<br>
relationship between parameter sets and time slots. In the<br>
example shown, three parameter sets (parameter set 1, parameter<br>
set 2, parameter set 3) are applied to an ordered set of 12<br>
time slots in a single spatial frame. In this case, an entire<br>
frequency range of an audio signal is divided into 9 parameter<br>
bands. Thus, the horizontal axis indicates the number of time<br>
slots and the vertical axis indicates the number of parameter<br>
bands. Each of the three parameter sets is applied to a<br>
specific time slot. For example, a first parameter set<br>
(parameter set 1) is applied to a time slot #1, a second<br>
parameter set (parameter set 2) is applied to a time slot #5,<br>
and a third parameter set (parameter set 3) is applied to a<br>
time slot #9. The parameter sets can be applied to the other<br>
time slots by interpolating and/or copying the parameter sets<br>
18<br><br>
to those time slots. Generally, the number of parameter sets<br>
can be equal to or less than the number of time slots, and the<br>
number of parameter bands can be equal to or less than the<br>
number of frequency bands of the audio signal. By encoding<br>
spatial information for portions of the time-frequency domain<br>
of an audio signal instead of the entire time-frequency domain<br>
of the audio signal, it is possible to reduce the amount of<br>
spatial information sent from an encoder to a decoder. This<br>
data reduction is possible since sparse information in the<br>
time-frequency domain is often sufficient for human auditory<br>
perception in accordance with known principals of perceptual<br>
audio coding.<br>
An important feature of the disclosed embodiments is the<br>
encoding and decoding of time slot positions to which parameter<br>
sets are applied using a fixed or variable number of bits. The<br>
number of parameter bands can also be represented with a fixed<br>
number of bits or a variable number of bits. The variable bit<br>
coding scheme can also be applied to other information used in<br>
spatial audio coding, including but not limited to information<br>
associated with time, spatial and/or frequency domains (e.g.,<br>
applied to a number of frequency subbands output from a filter<br>
bank).<br>
FIG. 7A illustrates a syntax for representing<br>
configuration information of a spatial information signal<br>
19<br><br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
configuration information includes a plurality of fields 701 to<br>
718 to which a number of bits can be assigned.<br>
A "bsSamplingFrequencylndex" field 701 indicates a<br>
sampling frequency obtained from a sampling process of an audio<br>
signal. To represent the sampling frequency, 4 bits are<br>
allocated to the "bsSamplingFrequencylndex" field 701. If a<br>
value of the "bsSamplingFrequencylndex" field 701 is 15, i.e.,<br>
a binary number of 1111, a "bsSamplingFrequency" field 702 is<br>
added to represent the sampling frequency. In this case, 24<br>
bits are allocated to the "bsSamplingFrequency" field 702.<br>
A "bsFrameLength" field 7 03 indicates a total number of<br>
time slots (hereinafter named "numSlots") within one spatial<br>
frame, and a relation of numSlots = bsFrameLength + 1 can exist<br>
between "numSlots" and the "bsFrameLength" field 703.<br>
A "bsFreqRes" field 704 indicates a total number of<br>
parameter bands spanning an entire frequency domain of an audio<br>
signal. The "bsFreqRes" field 704 will be explained in FIG. 7B.<br>
A "bsTreeConfig" field 705 indicates information for a<br>
tree configuration including a plurality of channel converting<br>
modules, such as described in reference to FIG. 4. The<br>
information for the tree configuration includes such<br>
information as a type of a channel converting module, a number<br>
of channel converting modules, a type of spatial information<br>
20<br><br>
used in the channel converting module, a number of input/output<br>
channels of an audio signal, etc.<br>
The tree configuration can have one of a 5-1-5<br>
configuration, a 5-2-5 configuration, a 7-2-7 configuration, a<br>
7-5-7 configuration and the like, according to a type of a<br>
channel converting module or a number of channels. The 5-2-5<br>
configuration of the tree configuration is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
A "bsQuantMode" field 706 indicates quantization mode<br>
information of spatial information.<br>
A "bsOnelcc" field 707 indicates whether one ICC<br>
parameter sub-set is used for all OTT boxes. In this case, the<br>
parameter sub-set means a parameter set applied to a specific<br>
time slot and a specific channel converting module.<br>
A "bsArbitraryDownmix" field 708 indicates a presence or<br>
non-presence of an arbitrary downmix gain.<br>
A "bsFixedGainSur" field 709 indicates a gain applied to<br>
a surround channel, e.g., LS (left surround) and RS (right<br>
surround).<br>
A "bsFixedgainLF" field 710 indicates a gain applied to a<br>
LFE channel.<br>
A "bsFixedGainDM" field 711 indicates a gain applied to a<br>
downmix signal.<br>
A "bsMatrixMode" field 712 indicates whether a matrix<br>
compatible stereo downmix signal is generated from an encoder.<br>
21<br><br>
A "bsTempShapeConfig" field 713 indicates an operation<br>
mode of temporal shaping (e.g., TES (temporal envelope shaping)<br>
and/or TP (temporal shaping)) in a decoder.<br>
"bsDecorrConfig" field 714 indicates an operation mode of<br>
a decorrelator of a decoder.<br>
And, "bs3DaudioMode" field 715 indicates whether a<br>
downmix signal is encoded into a 3D signal and whether an<br>
inverse HRTF processing is used.<br>
After information of each of the fields has been<br>
determined/extracted in an encoder/decoder, information for a<br>
number of parameter bands applied to a channel converting<br>
module is determined/extracted in the encoder/decoder. A<br>
number of parameter bands applied to an OTT box is first<br>
determined/extracted (716) and a number of parameter bands<br>
applied to a TTT box is then determined/extracted (717) . The<br>
number of parameter bands to the OTT box and/or TTT box will be<br>
described in detail with reference to FIGS. 8A to 9B.<br>
In case that an extension frame exists, a<br>
"spatialExtensionConfig" block 718 includes configuration<br>
information for the extension frame. Information included in<br>
the "spatialExtensionConfig" block 718 will be described in<br>
reference to FIGS. 10A to 10D.<br>
FIG. 7B is a table for a number of parameter bands of a<br>
spatial information signal according to one embodiment of the<br>
22<br><br>
present invention. A "numBands" indicates a number of<br>
parameter bands for an entire frequency domain of an audio<br>
signal and "bsFreqRes" indicates index information for the<br>
number of parameter bands. For example, the entire frequency<br>
domain of an audio signal can be divided by a number of<br>
parameter bands as desired (e.g., 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28,<br>
etc.).<br>
In some embodiments, one parameter can be applied to each<br>
parameter band. For example, if the "numBands" is 28, then the<br>
entire frequency domain of an audio signal is divided into 28<br>
parameter bands and each of the 28 parameters can be applied to<br>
each of the 28 parameter bands. In another example, if the<br>
"numBands" is 4, then the entire frequency domain of a given<br>
audio signal is divided into 4 parameter bands and each of the<br>
4 parameters can be applied to each of the 4 parameter bands.<br>
In FIG. 7B, the term "Reserved" means that a number of<br>
parameter bands for the entire frequency domain of a given<br>
audio signal is not determined.<br>
It should be noted a human auditory organ is not<br>
sensitive to the number of parameter bands used in the coding<br>
scheme. Thus, using a small number of parameter bands can<br>
provide a similar spatial audio effect to a listener than if a<br>
larger number of parameter bands were used.<br>
Unlike the "numBands", the "numSlots" represented by the<br>
23<br><br>
"bsFramelength" field 703 shown in FIG. 7A can represent all<br>
values. The values of "numSlots" may be limited, however, if<br>
the number of samples within one spatial frame is exactly-<br>
divisible by the "numSlots." Thus, if a maximum value of the<br>
vnumSlots" to be substantially represented is Ab' , every value<br>
of the "bsFramelength" field 703 can be represented by<br>
ceil{log2 (b) } bit(s). In this case, ,ceil(x)' means a minimum<br>
integer larger than or equal to the value *x' . For example, if<br>
one spatial frame includes 72 time slots, then ceil{log2 (72)} =<br>
7 bits can be allocated to the "bsFrameLength" field 703, and<br>
the number of parameter bands applied to a channel converting<br>
module can be decided within the "numBands".<br>
FIG. 8A illustrates a syntax for representing a number of<br>
parameter bands applied to an OTT box by a fixed number of bits<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 7A and 8A, a value of *i' has a value of<br>
zero to numOttBoxes-1, where numOttBoxes' is the total number<br>
Qf OTT boxes. Namely, the value of Ai' indicates each OTT box,<br>
and a number of parameter bands applied to each OTT box is<br>
represented according to the value of xi' . If an OTT box has<br>
an LFE channel mode, the number of parameter bands (hereinafter<br>
named "bsOttBands") applied to the LFE channel of the OTT box<br>
can be represented using a fixed number of bits. In the<br>
example shown in FIG. 8A, 5 bits are allocated to the<br>
24<br><br>
"bsOttBands" field 801. If an OTT box does not have a LFE<br>
channel mode, the total number of parameter bands (numBands)<br>
can be applied to a channel of the OTT box.<br>
FIG. 8B illustrates a syntax for representing a number of<br>
parameter bands applied to an OTT box by a variable number of<br>
bits according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG.<br>
8B, which is similar to FIG. 8A, differs from FIG. 8A in that<br>
"bsOttBands" field 802 shown in FIG. 8B is represented by a<br>
variable number of bits. In particular, the "bsOttBands" field<br>
802, which has a value equal to or less than "numBands", can be<br>
represented by a variable number of bits using "numBands".<br>
If the "numBands" lies within a range equal to or greater<br>
than 2A(n-l) and less than 2A(n), the "bsOttBands" field 802<br>
can be represented by variable n bits.<br>
For example: (a) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsOttBands" field 802 is represented by 6 bits; (b) if the<br>
"numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsOttBands" field 802 is<br>
represented by 5 bits; (c) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsOttBands" field 802 is represented by 4 bits; and (d) if the<br>
"numBands" is 7, 5 or 4, the "bsOttBands" field 802 is<br>
represented by 3 bits.<br>
If the "numBands" lies within a range greater than 2A(n-<br>
1) and equal to or less than 2A(n), the "bsOttBands" field 802<br>
can be represented by variable n bits.<br>
25<br><br>
For example: (a) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsOttBands" field 802 is represented by 6 bits; (b) if the<br>
"numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsOttBands" field 802 is<br>
represented by 5 bits; (c) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsOttBands" field 802 is represented by 4 bits; (d) if the<br>
"numBands" is 7 or 5, the "bsOttBands" field 802 is represented<br>
by 3 bits; and (e) if the "numBands" is 4, the "bsOttBands"<br>
field 802 is represented by 2 bits.<br>
The "bsOttBands" field 802 can be represented by a<br>
variable number of bits through a function (hereinafter named<br>
"ceil function") of rounding up to a nearest integer by taking<br>
the "numBands" as a variable.<br>
In particular, i) in case of 0<bsottbandsnumbands or></bsottbandsnumbands>
0bsOttBands<numbands the field is></numbands>
represented by a number of bits corresponding to a value of<br>
ceil (log2 (numBands)) or ii) in case of ObsOttBandsnumBands,<br>
the "bsOttBands" field 802 can be represented by<br>
ceil (log2 (numBands+1) bits.<br>
If a value equal to or less than the "numBands"<br>
(hereinafter named "numberBands") is arbitrarily determined,<br>
the "bsOttBands" field 802 can be represented by a variable<br>
number of bits through the ceil function by taking the<br>
"numberBands" as a variable.<br>
In particular, i) in case of 0<bsottbandsnumberbands or></bsottbandsnumberbands>
26<br><br>
0bsOttBands<numberbands the field is></numberbands>
represented by ceil (log2 (numberBands) ) bits or ii) in case of<br>
ObsOttBandsnumberBands, the "bsOttBands" field 802 can be<br>
represented by ceil (log2 (numberBands+1) bits.<br>
If more than one OTT box is used, a combination of the<br>
"bsOttBands" can be expressed by Formula 1 below<br><br>
where, bsOttBandsi indicates an ith "bsOttBands". For<br>
example, assume there are three OTT boxes and three values<br>
(N=3) for the "bsOttBands" field 802. In this example, the<br>
three values of the "bsOttBands" field 802 (hereinafter named<br>
al, a2 and a3, respectively) applied to the three OTT boxes,<br>
respectively, can be represented by 2 bits each. Hence, a<br>
total of 6 bits are needed to express the values al, a2 and a3.<br>
Yet, if the values al, a2 and a3 are represented as a group,<br>
then 27 (= 3*3*3) cases can occur, which can be represented by<br>
5 bits, saving one bit. If the "numBands" is 3 and a group<br>
value represented by 5 bits is 15, the group value can be<br>
represented as 15=lx(3A2)+2*(3A1)+0*(3A0). Hence, a decoder<br>
can determine from the group value 15 that the three values al,<br>
a2 and a3 of the "bsOttBands" field 802 are 1, 2 and 0,<br>
respectively, by applying the inverse of Formula 1.<br>
In the case of multiple OTT boxes, the combination of<br>
27<br><br>
"bsOttBands" can be represented as one of Formulas 2 to 4<br>
(defined below) using the "numberBands". Since representation<br>
of "bsOttBands" using the "numberbands" is similar to the<br>
representation using the "numBands" in Formula 1, a detailed<br>
explanation shall be omitted and only the formulas are<br>
presented below.<br>
[Formula 2]<br><br>
FIG. 9A illustrates a syntax for representing a number of<br>
parameter bands applied to a TTT box by a fixed number of bits<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 7A and 9A, a value of yi' has a value of<br>
zero to numTttBoxes-1, where numTttBoxes' is a number of all<br>
TTT boxes. Namely, the value of i' indicates each TTT box. A<br>
number of parameter bands applied to each TTT box is<br>
represented according to the value of xi'. In some embodiments,<br>
the TTT box can be divided into a low frequency band range and<br>
28<br><br>
a high frequency band range, and different processes can be<br>
applied to the low and high frequency band ranges. Other<br>
divisions are possible.<br>
A "bsTttDualMode" field 901 indicates whether a given TTT<br>
box operates in different modes (hereinafter called "dual<br>
mode") for a low band range and a high band range, respectively.<br>
For example, if a value of the "bsTttDualMode" field 901 is<br>
zero, then one mode is used for the entire band range without<br>
discriminating between a low band range and a high band range.<br>
If a value of the "bsTttDualMode" field 901 is 1, then<br>
different modes can be used for the low band range and the high<br>
band range, respectively:<br>
A "bsTttModeLow" field 902 indicates an operation mode of<br>
a given TTT box, which can have various operation modes. For<br>
example, the TTT box can have a prediction mode which uses, for<br>
example, CPC and ICC parameters, an energy-based mode which<br>
uses, for example, CLD parameters, etc. If a TTT box has a<br>
dual mode, additional information for a high band range may be<br>
needed.<br>
A "bsTttModeHigh" field 903 indicates an operation mode<br>
of the high band range, in the case that the TTT box has a dual<br>
mode.<br>
A "bsTttBandsLow" field 904 indicates a number of<br>
parameter bands applied to the TTT box.<br>
29<br><br>
A "bsTttBandsHigh" field 905 has "numBands".<br>
If a TTT box has a dual mode, a low band range may be<br>
equal to or greater than zero and less than "bsTttBandsLow",<br>
while a high band range may be equal to or greater than<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" and less than "bsTttBandsHigh".<br>
If a TTT box does not have a dual mode, a number of<br>
parameter bands applied to the TTT box may be equal to or<br>
greater than zero and less than "numBands" (907) .<br>
The "bsTttBandsLow" field 904 can be represented by a<br>
fixed number of bits. For instance, as shown in FIG. 9A, 5 bits<br>
can be allocated to represent the "bsTttBandsLow" field 904.<br>
FIG. 9B illustrates a syntax for representing a number of<br>
parameter bands applied to a TTT box by a variable number of<br>
bits according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG.<br>
9B is similar to FIG. 9A but differs from FIG. 9A in<br>
representing a "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 of FIG. 9B by a<br>
variable number of bits while representing a "bsTttBandsLow"<br>
field 904 of FIG. 9A by a fixed number of bits. In particular,<br>
since the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 has a value equal to or<br>
less than "numBands", the "bsTttBands" field 907 can be<br>
represented by a variable number of bits using "numBands".<br>
In particular, in the case that the "numBands" is equal<br>
to or greater than 2A(n-l) and less than 2A (n), the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" field 907 can be represented by n bits.<br>
30<br><br>
For example: (i) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is represented by 6 bits; (ii) if the<br>
"numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is<br>
represented by 5, bits; (iii) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is represented by 4 bits; and (iv) if<br>
the "numBands" is 7, 5 or 4, the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is<br>
represented by 3 bits.<br>
If the "numBands" lies within a range greater than 2A(n-<br>
1) and equal to or less than 2A (n) , then the "bsTttBandsLow"<br>
field 907 can be represented by n bits.<br>
For example: (i) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is represented by 6 bits; (ii) if the<br>
"numBands" is . 28 or 20, the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is<br>
represented by 5 bits; (iii) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is represented by 4 bits; (iv) if the<br>
"numBands" is 7 or 5, the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is<br>
represented by 3 bits; and (v) if the "numBands" is 4, the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" field 907 is represented by 2 bits.<br>
The "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 can be represented by a<br>
number of bits decided by a ceil function by taking the<br>
"numBands" as a variable.<br>
For example: i) in case of 0<bstttbandslownumbands or></bstttbandslownumbands>
0bsTttBandsLow<numbands the field is></numbands>
represented by a number of bits corresponding to a value of<br>
31<br><br>
ceil(log2(numBands) ) or ii) in case of ObsTttBandsLownumBands,<br>
the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 can be represented by<br>
ceil (log2 (numBands+1) bits.<br>
If a value equal to or less than the "numBands", i.e.,<br>
"numberBands" is arbitrarily determined, the "bsTttBandsLow"<br>
field 907 can be represented by a variable number of bits using<br>
the "numberBands".<br>
In particular, i) in case of 0<bstttbandslownumberbands></bstttbandslownumberbands>
or 0bsTttBandsLow<numberbands the field></numberbands>
is represented by a number of bits corresponding to a value of<br>
ceil (log2 (numberBands) ) or ii) in case of<br>
ObsTttBandsLownumberBands, the "bsTttBandsLow" field 907 can<br>
be represented by a number of bits corresponding to a value of<br>
ceil (log2 (numberBands+1) .<br>
If the case of multiple TTT boxes, a combination of the<br>
"bsTttBandsLow" can be expressed as Formula 5 defined below.<br>
[Formula 5]<br><br>
In this case, bsTttBandsLowi indicates an ith<br>
"bsTttBandsLow". Since the meaning of Formula 5 is identical<br>
to that of Formula 1, a detailed explanation of Formula 5 is<br>
omitted in the following description.<br>
In the case of multiple TTT boxes, the combination of<br>
32<br><br>
"bsTttBandsLow" can be represented as one of Formulas 6 to 8<br>
using the "numberBands". Since the meaning of Formulas 6 to 8<br>
is identical to those of Formulas 2 to 4, a detailed<br>
explanation of Formulas 6 to 8 will be omitted in the following<br>
description.<br>
[Formula 6]<br><br>
A number of parameter bands applied to the channel<br>
converting module (e.g., OTT box and/or TTT box) can be<br>
represented as a division value of the "numBands". In this<br>
case, the division value uses a half value of the "numBands" or<br>
a value resulting from dividing the "numBands" by a specific<br>
value.<br>
Once a number of parameter bands applied to the OTT<br>
and/or TTT box is determined, parameter sets can be determined<br>
which can be applied to each OTT box and/or each TTT box within<br>
a range of the number of parameter bands. Each of the<br>
parameter sets can be applied to each OTT box and/or each TTT<br>
33<br><br>
box by time slot unit. Namely, one parameter set can be<br>
applied to one time slot.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, one spatial<br>
frame can include a plurality of time slots. If the spatial<br>
frame is a fixed frame type, then a parameter set can be<br>
applied to a plurality of the time slots with an equal interval.<br>
If the frame is a variable frame type, position information of<br>
the time slot to which the parameter set is applied is needed.<br>
This will be explained in detail later with reference to FIGS.<br>
13A to 13C.<br>
FIG. 10A illustrates a syntax for spatial extension<br>
configuration information for a spatial extension frame<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Spatial<br>
extension configuration information can include a<br>
"bsSacExtType" field 1001, a "bsSacExtLen" field 1002, a<br>
"bsSacExtLenAdd" field 1003, a "bsSacExtLenAddAdd" field 1004<br>
and a "bsFillBits" field 1007. Other fields are possible.<br>
The "bsSacExtType" field 1001 indicates a data type of a<br>
spatial extension frame. For example, the spatial extension<br>
frame can be filled up with zeros, residual signal data,<br>
arbitrary downmix residual signal data or arbitrary tree data.<br>
The "bsSacExtLen" field 1002 indicates a number of bytes<br>
of the spatial extension configuration information.<br>
The "bsSacExtLenAdd" field 1003 indicates an additional<br>
34<br><br>
number of bytes of spatial extension configuration information<br>
if a byte number of the spatial extension configuration<br>
information becomes equal to or greater than, for example, 15.<br>
The "bsSacExtLenAddAdd" field 1004 indicates an<br>
additional number of bytes of spatial extension configuration<br>
information if a byte number of the spatial extension<br>
configuration information becomes equal to or greater than, for<br>
example, 270.<br>
After the respective fields have been<br>
determined/extracted in an encoder/decoder, the configuration<br>
information for a data type included in the spatial extension<br>
frame is determined (1005).<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, residual<br>
signal data, arbitrary downmix residual signal data, tree<br>
configuration data or the like can be included in the spatial<br>
extension frame.<br>
Subsequently, a number of unused bits of a length of the<br>
spatial extension configuration information is calculated 1006.<br>
The "b'sFillBits" field 1007 indicates a number of bits of<br>
data that can be neglected to fill the unused bits.<br>
FIGS. 10B and 10C illustrate syntaxes for spatial<br>
extension configuration information for a residual signal in<br>
case that the residual signal is included in a spatial<br>
extension frame according to one embodiment of the present<br>
35<br><br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10B, a<br>
"bsResidualSamplingFrequencylndex" field 1008 indicates a<br>
sampling frequency of a residual signal.<br>
A "bsResidualFramesPerSpatialFrame" field 1009 indicates<br>
a number of residual frames per a spatial frame. For instance,<br>
1, 2, 3 or 4 residual frames can be included in one spatial<br>
frame.<br>
A "ResidualConfig" block 1010 indicates a number of<br>
parameter bands for a residual signal applied to each OTT<br>
and/or TTT box.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10C, a "bsResidualPresent" field 1011<br>
indicates whether a residual signal is applied to .each OTT<br>
and/or TTT box.<br>
A "bsResidualBands" field 1012 indicates a number of<br>
parameter bands of the residual signal existing in each OTT<br>
and/or TTT box if the residual signal exists in the each OTT<br>
and/or TTT box. A number of parameter bands of the residual<br>
signal can be 'represented by a fixed number of bits or a<br>
variable number of bits. In case that the number of parameter<br>
bands is represented by a fixed number of bits, the residual<br>
signal is able to have a value equal to or less than a total<br>
number of parameter bands of an audio signal. So, a bit number<br>
(e.g., 5 bits in FIG. 10C) necessary for representing a number<br>
36<br><br>
of all parameter bands can be allocated.<br>
FIG. 10D illustrates a syntax for representing a number<br>
of parameter bands of a residual signal by a variable number of<br>
bits according to one embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 can be represented by a variable<br>
number of bits using "numBands". If the numBands is equal to<br>
or greater than 2A(n-l) and less than 2A(n), the<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 can be represented by n bits.<br>
For instance: (i) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 is represented by 6 bits; (ii) if<br>
the "numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014 is<br>
represented by 5 bits; (iii) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 is represented by 4 bits; and (iv)<br>
if the "numBands" is 7, 5 or 4, the "bsResidualBands" field<br>
1014 is represented by 3 bits.<br>
If the numBands is greater than 2A(n-l) and equal to or<br>
less than 2A (n) , then the number of parameter bands of the<br>
residual signal can be represented by n bits.<br>
For instance: (i) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 is represented by 6 bits; (ii) if<br>
the "numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014 is<br>
represented by 5 bits; (iii) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 is represented by 4 bits; (iv) if<br>
the "numBands" is 7 or 5, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014 is<br>
37<br><br>
represented by 3 bits; and (v) if the "numBands" is 4, the<br>
"bsResidualBands" field 1014 is represented by 2 bits.<br>
Moreover, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014 can be<br>
represented by a bit number decided by a ceil function of<br>
rounding up to a nearest integer by taking the "numBands" as a<br>
variable.<br>
In particular, i) in case of 0<bsresidualbandsnumbands></bsresidualbandsnumbands>
or 0bsResidualBands<numbands the field></numbands>
is represented by ceil{log2 (numBands) } bits or ii) in case of<br>
ObsResidualBandsnumBands, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014<br>
can be represented by ceil{log2(numBands+1)} bits.<br>
In some embodiments, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014 can<br>
be represented using a value (numberBands) equal to or less<br>
than the numBands.<br>
In particular, i) in case of<br>
0<bsresidualbandsnumberbands or></bsresidualbandsnumberbands>
the "bsResidualBands" field 1014 is represented by<br>
ceil{log2 (numberBands) } bits or ii) in case of<br>
ObsresidualBandsnumberBands, the "bsResidualBands" field 1014<br>
can be represented by ceil{log2 (numberBands+1) } bits.<br>
If a plurality of residual signals (N) exist, a<br>
combination of the "bsResidualBands" can be expressed as shown<br>
in Formula 9 below.<br>

The residual signal may be included in a bitstream of an<br>
audio signal together with a downmix signal and a spatial<br>
information signal, and the bitstream can be transferred to a<br>
decoder. The decoder can extract the downmix signal, the<br>
spatial information signal and the residual signal from the<br>
bitstream.<br>
Subsequently, the downmix signal is upmixed using the<br>
spatial information. Meanwhile, the residual signal is applied<br>
to the downmix signal in the course of upmixing. In particular,<br>
the downmix signal is upmixed in a plurality of channel<br>
converting modules using the spatial information. In doing so,<br>
the residual signal is applied to the channel converting module.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the channel<br>
converting module has a number of parameter bands and a<br>
parameter set is applied to the channel converting module by a<br>
time slot unit. When the residual signal is applied to the<br>
channel converting module, the residual signal may be needed to<br>
update inter-channel correlation information of the audio<br>
signal to which the residual signal is applied. Then, the<br>
updated inter-channel correlation information is used in an up-<br>
mixing process.<br>
FIG. 11A is a block diagram of a decoder for non-guided<br>
coding according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
40<br><br>
Non-guided coding means that spatial information is not<br>
included in a bitstream of an audio signal.<br>
In some embodiments, the decoder includes an analysis<br>
filterbank 1102, an analysis unit 1104, a spatial synthesis<br>
unit 1106 and a synthesis filterbank 1108. Although a downmix<br>
signal in a stereo signal type is shown in FIG. 11A, other<br>
types of downmix signals can be used.<br>
In operation, the decoder receives a downmix signal 1101<br>
and the analysis filterbank 1102 converts the received downmix<br>
signal 1101 to a frequency domain signal 1103. The analysis<br>
unit 1104 generates spatial information from the converted<br>
downmix signal 1103. The analysis unit 1104 performs a<br>
processing by a slot unit and the spatial information 1105 can<br>
be generated per a plurality of slots. In this case, the slot<br>
includes a time slot.<br>
The spatial information can be generated in two steps.<br>
First, a downmix parameter is generated from the downmix signal.<br>
Second, the downmix parameter is converted to spatial<br>
information, such as a spatial parameter. In some embodiments,<br>
the downmix parameter can be generated through a matrix<br>
calculation of the downmix signal.<br>
The spatial synthesis unit 1106 generates a multi-channel<br>
audio signal 1107 by synthesizing the generated spatial<br>
information 1105 with the downmix signal 1103. The generated<br>
41<br><br>
multi-channel audio signal 1107 passes through the synthesis<br>
filterbank 1108 to be converted to a time domain audio signal<br>
1109.<br>
The spatial information may be generated at predetermined<br>
slot positions. The distance between the positions may be<br>
equal {i.e., equidistant). For example, the spatial information<br>
may be generated per 4 slots. The spatial information can also<br>
be generated at variable slot positions. In this case, the<br>
slot position information from which the spatial information is<br>
generated can be extracted from the bitstream. The position<br>
information can be represented by a variable number of bits.<br>
The position information can be represented as a absolute value<br>
and a difference value from a previous slot position<br>
information.<br>
In case of using the non-guided coding, a number of<br>
parameter bands (hereinafter named "bsNumguidedBlindBands") for<br>
each channel of an audio signal can be represented by a fixed<br>
number of bits. The "bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be represented<br>
by a variable number of bits using "numBands". For example, if<br>
the "numBands" is equal to or greater than 2A(n-l) and less<br>
than 2A(n), the "bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be represented by<br>
variable n bits.<br>
In particular, (a) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" is represented by 6 bits, (b) if the<br>
42<br><br>
"numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsNumguidedBlindBands" is<br>
represented by 5 bits, (c) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" is represented by 4 bits, and (d) if<br>
the "numBands" is 7, 5 or 4, the "bsNumguidedBlindBands" is<br>
represented by 3 bits.<br>
If the "numBands" is greater than 2A(n-l) and equal to or<br>
less than 2A(n), then "bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be<br>
represented by variable n bits.<br>
For instance: (a) if the "numBands" is 40, the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" is represented by 6 bits; (b) if the<br>
"numBands" is 28 or 20, the "bsNumguidedBlindBands" is<br>
represented by 5 bits; (c) if the "numBands" is 14 or 10, the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" is represented by 4 bits; (d) if the<br>
"numBands" is 7 or 5, the "bsNumguidedBlindBands" is<br>
represented by 3 bits; and (e) if the "numBands" is 4, the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" is represented by 2 bits.<br>
Moreover, "bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be represented by a<br>
variable number of bits using the ceil function by taking the<br>
"numBands" as a variable.<br>
For example, i) in case of<br>
0<bsnumguidedblindbandsnumbands or></bsnumguidedblindbandsnumbands>
0bsNumguidedBlindBands<numbands the></numbands>
is represented by ceil{log2 (numBands) } bits or ii) in case of<br>
ObsNumguidedBlindBandsnumBands, the "bsNumguidedBlindBands"<br>
43<br><br>
can be represented by ceil{log2 (numBands+1) } bits.<br>
If a value equal to or less than the "numBands", i.e.,<br>
"numberBands" is arbitrarily determined,	the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be represented as follows.<br>
In particular, i) in case	of<br>
(KbsNumguidedBlindBandsnumberBands	or<br>
0bsNumguidedBlindBands<numberbands the></numberbands>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" is represented	by<br>
ceil{'log2 (numberBands) } bits or ii) in case of<br>
ObsNumguidedBlindBandsnumberBands,	the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be represented	by<br>
ceil{log2 (numberBands+1)} bits.<br>
If a number of channels (N) exist, a combination of the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be expressed as Formula 13.<br>
[Formula 13]<br><br>
In this case, "bsNurnguidedBlindBandsi" indicates an ith<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands". Since the meaning, of Formula 13 is<br>
identical to that of Formula 1, a detailed explanation of<br>
Formula 13 is omitted in the following description.<br>
If there are multiple channels, the<br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" can be represented as one of Formulas<br>
14 to 16 using the "numberBands". Since representation of<br>
44<br><br>
"bsNumguidedBlindBands" using the '"number-bands" is identical to<br>
the representations of Formulas 2 to 4, detailed explanation of<br>
Formulas 14 to 16 will be omitted in the following description.<br>
[Formula 14]<br><br>
FIG. 11B is a diagram for a method of representing a<br>
number of parameter bands as a group according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A number of parameter<br>
bands includes number information of parameter bands applied to<br>
a channel converting module, number information of parameter<br>
bands applied to a residual signal and number information of<br>
parameter bands for each channel of an audio signal in case of<br>
using non-guided coding. In the case that there exists a<br>
plurality of number information of parameter bands, the<br>
plurality of the number information (e.g., "bsOttBands",<br>
"bsTttBands", "bsResidualBand" and/or "bsNumguidedBlindBands")<br>
can be represented as at least one or more groups.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11B, if there are (kN+L) number<br>
45<br><br>
information of parameter bands and if Q bits are needed to<br>
represent each number information of parameter bands, a<br>
plurality of number information of parameter bands can be<br>
represented as a following group. In this case, Ak' and *N' are<br>
arbitrary integers not zero and AL' is an arbitrary integer<br>
meeting OIXN.<br>
A grouping method includes the steps of generating k<br>
groups by binding N number information of parameter bands and<br>
generating a last group by binding last L number information of<br>
parameter bands. The k groups can be represented as M bits and<br>
the last group can be represented as p bits. In this case, the<br>
M bits are preferably less than N*Q bits used in the case of<br>
representing each number information of parameter bands without<br>
grouping them. The p bits are preferably equal to or less than<br>
L*Q bits used in case of representing each number information<br>
of the parameter bands without grouping them.<br>
For instance, assume that two number information of<br>
parameter bands are bl and b2, respectively. If each of the bl<br>
and b2 is able to have five values, 3 bits are needed to<br>
represent each of the bl and b2. In this case, even if the 3<br>
bits are able to represent eight values, five values are<br>
substantially needed. So, each of the bl and b2 has three<br>
redundancies. Yet, in case of representing the bl and b2 as a<br>
group by binding the bl and b2 together, 5 bits may be used<br>
46<br><br>
instead of 6 bits (= 3 bits + 3 bits). In particular, since all<br>
combinations of the bl and b2 include 25 (=5*5) types, a group<br>
of the bl and b2 can be represented as 5 bits. Since the 5 bits<br>
are able to represent 32 values, seven redundancies are<br>
generated in case of the grouping representation. Yet, in case<br>
of a representation by grouping bl and b2, redundancy is less<br>
than that of a case of representing each of the bl and b2 as 3<br>
bits. A method of representing a plurality of number<br>
information of parameter bands as groups can be implemented in<br>
various ways as follows.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
have 40 kinds of values each, k groups are generated using 2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or 6 as the N. The k groups can be represented as 11, 16,<br>
22, 27 and 32 bits, respectively. Alternatively, the k groups<br>
are represented by combining the respective cases.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
have 28 kinds of values each, k groups are generated using 6 as<br>
the N, and the k groups can be represented as 29 bits.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
have 20 kinds of values each, k groups are generated using 2, 3,<br>
4, 5, 6 or 7 as the N. The k groups can be represented as 9,<br>
13,.. 18, 22, 26 and 31 bits, respectively. Alternatively, the k<br>
groups can be represented by combining the respective cases.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
47<br><br>
have 14 kinds of values each, k groups can be generated using 6<br>
as the N. The k groups can be represented as 23 bits.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
have 10 kinds of values each, k groups are generated using 2, 3,<br>
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 as the N. The k groups can be represented<br>
as 7, 10, 14, 17, 20, 24, 27 and 30 bits, respectively.<br>
Alternatively, the k groups can be represented by combining the<br>
respective cases.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
have 7 kinds of values each, k groups are generated using 6, 7,<br>
8, 9, 10 or 11 as the N. The k groups are represented as 17, 20,<br>
23, 26, 29 and 31 bits, respectively. Alternatively, the k<br>
groups are represented by combining the respective cases.<br>
If a plurality of number information of parameter bands<br>
have, for example, 5 kinds of values each, k groups can be<br>
generated using 2, 3, 4, 5,. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 as the<br>
N. The k groups can be represented as 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19,<br>
21, 24, 26, 28 and 31 bits, respectively. Alternatively, the k<br>
groups are represented by combining the respective cases.<br>
Moreover, a plurality of number information of parameter<br>
bands can be configured to be represented as the groups<br>
described above, or to be consecutively represented by making<br>
each number information of parameter bands into an independent<br>
bit sequence.<br>
48<br><br>
FIG. 12 illustrates syntax representing configuration<br>
information of a spatial frame according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. A spatial frame includes a<br>
"Framinglnfo" block 1201, a "bslndependencyfield 1202, a<br>
"OttData" block 1203, a "TttData" block 1204, a "SmgData" block<br>
1205 and a "tempShapeData" block 1206.<br>
The "Framinglnfo" block 1201 includes information for a<br>
number of parameter sets and information for time slot to which<br>
each parameter set is applied. The "Framinglnfo" block 1201 is<br>
explained in detail in FIG. 13A.<br>
The "bsIndependencyFlag" field 1202 indicates whether a<br>
current frame can be decoded without knowledge for a previous<br>
frame.<br>
The "OttData" block 1203 includes all spatial parameter<br>
information for all OTT boxes.<br>
The "TttData" block 1204 includes all spatial parameter<br>
information for all TTT boxes.<br>
The "SmgData" block 1205 includes information for<br>
temporal smoothing applied to a de-quantized spatial parameter.<br>
The "TempShapeData" block 1206 includes information for<br>
temporal envelope shaping applied to a decorrelated signal.<br>
FIG. 13A illustrates a syntax for representing time slot<br>
position information, to which a parameter set is applied,<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
49<br><br>
"bsFramingType" field 1301 indicates whether a spatial frame of<br>
an audio signal is a fixed frame type or a variable frame type.<br>
A fixed frame means a frame that a parameter set is applied to<br>
a preset time slot. for example, a parameter set is applied to<br>
a time slot preset with an equal interval. The variable frame<br>
means a frame that separately receives position information of<br>
a time slot to which a parameter set is applied.<br>
A "bsNumParamSets" field 1302 indicates a number of<br>
parameter sets within one spatial frame (hereinafter named<br>
"numParamSets"), and a relation of "numParamSets =<br>
bsNumparamSets + 1" exists between the "numParamSets" and the<br>
"bsNumParamSets".<br>
Since, e.g., 3 bits are allocated to the "bsNumParamSets"<br>
field 1302 in FIG. 13A, a maximum of eight parameter sets can<br>
be provided within one spatial frame. Since there is no limit<br>
on the number of allocated bits more parameter sets can be<br>
provided within a spatial frame.<br>
If the spatial frame is a fixed frame type, position<br>
information of a time slot to which a parameter set is applied<br>
can be decided according to a preset rule, and additional<br>
position information of a time slot to which a parameter set is<br>
applied is unnecessary. However, if the spatial frame is a<br>
variable frame type, position information of a time slot to<br>
which a parameter set is applied is needed.<br>
50<br><br>
A "bsParamSlot" field 1303 indicates position information<br>
of a time slot to which a parameter set is applied. The<br>
"bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be represented by a variable<br>
number of bits using the number of time slots within one<br>
spatial frame, i.e., "numSlots". In particular, in case that<br>
the "numSlots" is equal to or greater than 2A(n-l) and less<br>
than 2A(n), the "bsParamSlot" field 1103 can be represented by<br>
n bits.<br>
For instance: (i) if the "numSlots" lies within a range<br>
between 64 and 127, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be<br>
represented by 7 bits; (ii) if the "numSlots" lies within a<br>
range between 32 and 63, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be<br>
represented by 6 bits; (iii) if the "numSlots" lies within a<br>
range between 16 and 31, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be<br>
represented by 5 bits; (iv) if the "numSlots" lies within a<br>
range between 8 and 15, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be<br>
represented by 4 bits; (v) if the "numSlots" lies within a<br>
range between 4 and 7, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be<br>
represented by 3 bits; (vi) if the "numSlots" lies within a<br>
range between 2 and 3, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be<br>
represented by 2 bits; (vii) if the '"numSlots" is 1, the<br>
"bsParamSlot" field 1303 can be represented by 1 bit; and<br>
(viii) if the "numSlots" is 0, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 can<br>
be represented by 0 bit. Likewise, if the "numSlots" lies<br>
51<br><br>
within a range between 64 and 127, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303<br>
can be represented by 7 bits.<br>
If there are multiple parameter sets (N) , a combination<br>
of the "bsParamSlot" can be represented according to Formula 9.<br>
[Formula 9]<br><br>
In this case, "bsParamSlotsi" indicates a time slot to<br>
which an ith parameter set is applied. For instance, assume<br>
that the "numSlots" is 3 and that the "bsParamSlot" field 1303<br>
can have ten values. In this case, three information<br>
(hereinafter named cl, c2 and c3, respectively) for the<br>
"bsParamSlot" field 1303 are needed. Since 4 bits are needed to<br>
represent each of the cl, c2 and c3, total 12 (= 4*3) bits are<br>
needed. In case of representing the cl, c2 and c3 as a group<br>
by binding them together, 1,000 (= 10*10*10) cases can occur,<br>
which can be represented as 10 bits, thus saving 2 bits. If<br>
the "numSlots" is 3 and if the value read as 5 bits is 31, the<br>
value can be represented as 31=lx(3A2)+5*(3A1)+7*(3A0). A<br>
decoder apparatus can determine that the cl, c2 and c3 are 1, 5<br>
and 7, respectively, by applying the inverse of Formula 9.<br>
FIG. 13B illustrates a syntax for representing position<br>
information of a time slot to which a parameter set is applied<br>
as an absolute value and a difference value according to one<br>
52<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention. If a spatial frame is a<br>
variable frame type, the "bsParamSlot" field 1303 in FIG. 13A<br>
can be represented as an absolute value and a difference value<br>
using a fact that "bsParamSlot" information increases<br>
monotonously.<br>
For instance: (i) a position of a time slot to which a<br>
first parameter set is applied can be generated into an<br>
absolute value, i.e., "bsParamSlot[0]"; and (ii) a position of<br>
a time slot to which a second or higher parameter set is<br>
applied can be generated as a difference value, i.e.,<br>
"difference value" between "bsParamSlot[ps]" and<br>
"bsParamslot[ps-1]" or "difference value - 1" (hereinafter<br>
named "bsDiffParamSlot[ps]") . In this case, "ps" means a<br>
parameter set.<br>
The "bsParamslot[0]" field 1304 can be represented by a<br>
number of bits (hereinafter named "nBitsParamSlot(0)")<br>
calculated using the "numSlots" and the "numParamSets".<br>
The "bsDiffParamSlot[ps]" field 1305 can be represented<br>
by a number of bits (hereinafter named "nBitParamSlot(ps)")<br>
calculated using the "numSlots", the "numParamSets" and a<br>
position of a time slot to which a previous parameter set is<br>
applied, i.e., "bsParamSlot[ps-1]".<br>
In particular, to represent "bsParamSlot[ps]" by a<br>
minimum number of bits, a number of bits to represent the<br>
53<br><br>
"bsParamSlot[ps]" can be decided based on the following rules:<br>
(i) a plurality of the "bsParamSlot[ps]" increase in an<br>
ascending series (bsParamSlot[ps]&gt; bsParamSlot[ps-1]); (ii) a<br>
maximum value of the "bsParamSlot[0]" is "numSlots -<br>
NumParamSets"; and (iii) in case of 0 
"bsParamSlot[ps]" can have a value between "bsParamSlot[ps-1] +<br>
1" and "numSlots - numParamSets + ps" only.<br>
For example, if the "numSlots" is 10 and if the<br>
"numParamSets" is 3, since the "bsParamSlot[ps]" increases in<br>
an ascending series, a maximum value of the "bsParamSlot[0]"<br>
becomes "10-3=7". Namely, the "bsParamSlot[0]" should be<br>
selected from values of 0 to 7. This is because a number of<br>
time slots for the rest of parameter sets (e.g., if ps is 1 or<br>
2) is insufficient if the "bsParamSlot[0]" has a value greater<br>
than 7.<br>
If "bsParamSlot [0]" is 5, a time slot position<br>
bsParamSlot[1] for a second parameter set should be selected<br>
from values between "5+1=6" and "10-3+1=8".<br>
If "bsParamSlot[1]" is 7, "bsParamSlot[2]" can become 8<br>
or 9. If "bsParamSlot[1]" is 8, "bsParamSlot[2]" can become 9.<br>
Hence, the "bsParamSlot[ps]" can be represented as a<br>
variable bit number using the above features instead of being<br>
represented as fixed bits.<br>
In configuring the "bsParamSlot[ps]" in a bitstream, if<br>
54<br><br>
the "ps" is 0, the "bsParamSlot[0]" can be represented as an<br>
absolute value by a number of bits corresponding to<br>
"nBitsParamSlot(0)". If the "ps" is greater than 0, the<br>
"bsParamSlot[ps]" can be represented as a difference value by a<br>
number of bits corresponding to "nBitsParamSlot(ps)". In<br>
reading the above-configured "bsParamSlot[ps]" from a bitstream,<br>
a length of a bitstream for each data, i.e.,<br>
"nBitsParamSlot [ps]" can be found using Formula 10.<br>
[Formula 10]<br><br>
In particular, the "nBitsParamSlot[ps]" can be found as<br>
nBitsParamSlot [0]=fb(numSlots - numParamSets + 1). If<br>
0<ps the can be found as></ps>
nBitsParamSlot [ps]=fb(numSlots-numParamSets+ps-bsParamSlot [ps-<br>
1]). The "nBitsParamSlot[ps]" can be determined using Formula<br>
11, which extends Formula 10 up to 7 bits.<br>
[Formula 11]<br>
55<br><br><br>
An example of the function fb(x) is explained as follows.<br>
If "numSlots" is 15 and if "numParamSets" is 3, the function<br>
can be evaluated as nBitsParamSlot [0] = fb (15-3+1) = 4bits.<br>
If the "bsParamSlot[0] " represented by 4 bits is 7, the<br>
function can be evaluated as nBitsParamSlot[1] = fb (15-3+1-7) =<br>
3bits. In this case, "bsDiffParamSlot[1]" field 1305 can be<br>
represented by 3 bits.<br>
If the value represented by the 3 bits is 3,<br>
"bsParamSlot[1]" becomes 7+3 = 10. Hence, it becomes<br>
nBitsParamSlot[2] = fb (15-3+2-10) = 2bits. In this case,<br>
"bsDiffParamSlot[2]" field 1305 can be represented by 2 bits.<br>
If the number of remaining time slots is equal to a number of a<br>
remaining parameter sets, 0 bits may be allocated to the<br>
"bsDiffParamSlot[ps]" field. In other words, no additional<br>
information is needed to represent the position of the time<br>
slot to which the parameter set is applied.<br>
Thus, a number of bits for "bsParamSlot[ps]" can be<br>
variably decided. The number of bits for "bsParamSlot[ps]" can<br>
56<br><br>
be read from a bitstream using the function fb(x) in a decoder.<br>
In some embodiments, the function fb(x) can include the<br>
function ceil(log2(x) ) .<br>
In reading information for vbsParamSlot[ps]" represented<br>
as the absolute value and the difference value from a bitstream<br>
in a decoder, first the "bsParamSlot [0]" may be read from the<br>
bitstream and then the "bsDiffParamSlot [ps]" may be read for<br>
0<ps the can then be found for></ps>
an interval 0ps<numparamsets using the and for example as shown in fig.></numparamsets>
a "bsParamSlot[ps]" can be found by adding a "bsParamSlot[ps-<br>
1]" to a "bsDiffParamSlot[ps]+l".<br>
FIG. 13C illustrates a syntax for representing position<br>
information of a time slot to which a parameter set is applied<br>
as a group according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In case that a plurality of parameter sets exist, a plurality<br>
of "bsParamSlots" 1307 for a plurality of the parameter sets<br>
can be represented as at least one or more groups.<br>
If a number of the "bsParamSlots" 1307 is (kN+L) and if Q<br>
bits are needed to represent each of the "bsParamSlots" 1307,<br>
the "bsParamSlots" 1307 can be represented as a following group.<br>
In this case, xk' and N' are arbitrary integers not zero and<br>
AL' is an arbitrary integer meeting 0L<n.></n.>
A grouping method can include the steps of generating k<br>
57<br><br>
groups by binding N "bsParamSlots" 1307 each and generating a<br>
last group by binding last L "bsParamSlots" 1307. The k groups<br>
can be represented by M bits and the last group can be<br>
represented by p bits. In this case, the M bits are preferably<br>
less than N*Q bits used in the case of representing each of the<br>
"bsParamSlots" 1307 without grouping them. The p bits are<br>
preferably equal to or less than L*Q bits used in the case of<br>
representing each of the "bsParamSlots" 1307 without grouping<br>
them.<br>
For example, assume that a pair of "bsParamSlots" 1307<br>
for two parameter sets are dl and d2, respectively. If each of<br>
the dl and d2 is able to have five values, 3 bits are needed to<br>
represent each of the dl and d2. In this case, even if the 3<br>
bits are able to represent eight values, five values are<br>
substantially needed. So, each of the dl and d2 has three<br>
redundancies. Yet, in case of representing the dl and d2 as a<br>
group by binding the dl and d2 together, 5 bits are used<br>
instead of using 6 bits (= 3 bits + 3 bits) . In particular,<br>
since all combinations of the dl and d2 include 25 (= 5*5)<br>
types, a group of the dl and d2 can be represented as 5 bits<br>
only. Since the 5 bits are able to represent 32 values, seven<br>
redundancies are generated in case of the grouping<br>
representation. Yet, in case of a representation by grouping<br>
the dl and d2, redundancy is smaller than that of a case of<br>
58<br><br>
representing each of the dl and d2 as 3 bits.<br>
In configuring the group, data for the group can be<br>
configured using "bsParamSlot[0]" for an initial value and a<br>
difference value between pairs of the "bsParamSlot[ps]" for a<br>
second or higher value.<br>
In configuring the group, bits can be directly allocated<br>
without grouping if a number of parameter set is 1 and bits can<br>
be allocated after completion of grouping if a number of<br>
parameter sets is equal to or greater than 2.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flowchart of an encoding method according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. A method of encoding<br>
an audio signal and an operation of an encoder according to the<br>
present invention are explained as follows.<br>
First, a total number of time slots (numSlots) in one<br>
spatial frame and a total number of parameter bands (numBands)<br>
of an audio signal are determined (S1401).<br>
Then, a number of parameter bands applied to a channel<br>
converting module (OTT box and/or TTT box) and/or a residual<br>
signal are determined (S1402) .<br>
If the OTT box has a LFE channel mode, the number of<br>
parameter bands applied to the OTT box is separately determined.<br>
If the OTT box does not have the LFE channel mode,<br>
"numBands" is used as a number of the parameters applied to the<br>
OTT box.<br>
59<br><br>
Subsequently, a type of a spatial frame is determined.<br>
In this case, the spatial frame may be classified into a fixed<br>
frame type and a variable frame type.<br>
If the spatial frame is the variable frame type (S1403),<br>
a number of parameter sets used within one spatial frame is<br>
determined (S1406) . In this case, the parameter set can be<br>
applied to the channel converting module by a time slot unit.<br>
Subsequently, a position of time slot to which the<br>
parameter set is applied is determined (S1407). In this case,<br>
the position of time slot to which the parameter set is applied<br>
can be represented as an absolute value and a difference value.<br>
For example, a position of a time slot to which a first<br>
parameter set is applied can be represented as an absolute<br>
value, and a position of a time slot to which a second or<br>
higher parameter set is applied can be represented as a<br>
difference value from a position of a previous time slot. In<br>
this case, the position of a time slot to which the parameter<br>
set is applied can be represented by a variable number of bits.<br>
In particular, a position of time slot to which a first<br>
parameter set is applied can be represented by a number of bits<br>
calculated using a total number of time slots and a total<br>
number of parameter sets. A position of a time slot to which a<br>
second or higher parameter set is applied can be represented by<br>
a number of bits calculated using a total number of time slots,<br>
60<br><br>
a total number of parameter sets and a position of a time slot<br>
to which a previous parameter set is applied.<br>
If the spatial frame is a fixed frame type, a number of<br>
parameter sets used in one spatial frame is determined (S1404).<br>
In this case, a position of a time slot to which the parameter<br>
set is applied is decided using a preset rule. For example, a<br>
position of a time slot to which a parameter set is applied can<br>
be decided to have an equal interval from a position of a time<br>
slot to which a previous parameter set is applied (S1405) .<br>
Subsequently, a downmixing unit and a spatial information<br>
generating unit generate a downmix signal and spatial<br>
information, respectively, using the above-determined total<br>
number of time slots, a total number of parameter bands, a<br>
number of parameter bands to be applied to the channel<br>
converting unit, a total number of parameter sets in one<br>
spatial frame and position information of the time slot to<br>
which a parameter set is applied (S1408).<br>
Finally, a multiplexing unit generates a bitstream<br>
including the downmix signal and the spatial information<br>
(S1409) and then transfers the generated bitstream to a decoder<br>
(S1409) .<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart of a decoding method according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. A method of decoding<br>
an audio signal and an operation of a decoder according to the<br>
61<br><br>
present invention are explained as follows.<br>
First, a decoder receives a bitstream of an audio signal<br>
(S1501). A demultiplexing unit separates a downraix signal and<br>
a spatial information signal from the received bitstream<br>
(S1502). Subsequently, a spatial information signal decoding<br>
unit extracts information for a total number of time slots in<br>
one spatial frame, a total number of parameter bands and a<br>
number of parameter bands applied to a channel converting<br>
module from configuration information of the spatial<br>
information signal (S1503).<br>
If the spatial frame is a variable frame type (S1504), a<br>
number of parameter sets in one spatial frame and position<br>
information of a time slot to which the parameter set is<br>
applied are extracted from the spatial frame (S1505). The<br>
position information of the time slot can be represented by a<br>
fixed or variable number of bits. In this case, position<br>
information of time slot to which a first parameter set is<br>
applied may be represented as an absolute value and position<br>
information of time slots to which a second or higher parameter<br>
sets are applied can be represented as a difference value. The<br>
actual position information of time slots to which the second<br>
or higher parameter sets are applied can be found by adding the<br>
difference value to the position information of the time slot<br>
to which a previous parameter set is applied.<br>
62<br><br>
Finally, the downmix signal is converted to a multi-<br>
channel audio signal using the extracted information (S1506).<br>
The disclosed embodiments described above provide several<br>
advantages over conventional audio coding schemes.<br>
First, in coding a multi-channel audio signal by-<br>
representing a position of a time slot to which a parameter set<br>
is applied by a variable number of bits, the disclosed<br>
embodiments are able to reduce a transferred data quantity.<br>
Second, by representing a position of a time slot to<br>
which a first parameter set is applied as an absolute value,<br>
and by representing positions of time slots to which a second<br>
or higher parameter sets are applied as a difference value, the<br>
disclosed embodiments can reduce a transferred data quantity.<br>
Third, by representing a number of parameter bands<br>
applied to such a channel converting module as an OTT box<br>
and/or a TTT box by a fixed or variable number of bits, the<br>
disclosed embodiments can reduce a transferred data quantity.<br>
In this case, positions of time slots to which parameter sets<br>
are applied can be represented using the aforesaid principle,<br>
where the parameter sets may exist in range of a number of<br>
parameter bands.<br>
FIG. 16 is a block diagram of an exemplary device<br>
architecture 1600 for implementing the audio encoder/decoder,<br>
as described in reference to FIGS. 1-15. The device<br>
63<br><br>
architecture 1600 is applicable to a variety of devices,<br>

computers, consumer electronic devices, mobile phones, personal<br>
digital assistants (PDAs), electronic tablets, television<br>
systems, television set-top boxes, game consoles, media players,<br>
music players, navigation systems, and any other device capable<br>
of decoding audio signals. Some of these devices may implement<br>
a modified architecture using a combination of hardware and<br>
software.<br>
The architecture 1600 includes one or more processors<br>
1602 (e.g., PowerPC®, Intel Pentium® 4, etc.), one or more<br>
display devices 1604 (e.g., CRT, LCD), an audio subsystem 1606<br>
(e.g., audio hardware/software), one or more network interfaces<br>
1608 (e.g., Ethernet, FireWire®, USB, etc.), input devices 1610<br>
(e.g., keyboard, mouse, etc.), and one or more computer-<br>
readable mediums 1612 (e.g., RAM, ROM, SDRAM, hard disk,<br>
optical disk, flash memory, etc.). These components can<br>
exchange communications and data via one or more buses 1614<br>
(e.g., EISA, PCI, PCI Express, etc.).<br>
The term "computer-readable medium" refers to any medium<br>
that participates in providing instructions to a processor 1602<br>
for execution, including without limitation, non-volatile media<br>
(e.g., optical or magnetic disks), volatile media (e.g.,<br>
memory) and transmission media. Transmission media includes,<br>
64<br><br>
without limitation, coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber<br>
optics. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic,<br>
light or radio frequency waves.<br>
The computer-readable medium 1612 further .includes an<br>
operating system 1616 (e.g., Mac OS®, Windows®, Linux, etc.), a<br>
network communication module 1618, an audio codec 1620 and one<br>
or more applications 1622.<br>
The operating system 1616 can be multi-user,<br>
multiprocessing, multitasking, multithreading, real-time and<br>
the like. The operating system 1616 performs basic tasks,<br>
including but not limited to: recognizing input from input<br>
devices 1610; sending output to display devices 1604 and the<br>
audio subsystem 1606; keeping track of files and directories on<br>

printers, etc.); and managing traffic on the one or more buses<br>
1614.<br>
The network communications module 1618 includes various<br>
components for establishing and maintaining network connections<br>
(e.g., software for implementing communication protocols, such<br>
as TCP/IP, HTTP, Ethernet, etc.). The network communications<br>
module 1618 can include a browser for enabling operators of the<br>
device architecture 1600 to search a network (e.g., Internet)<br>
for information (e.g., audio content).<br>
65<br><br>
The audio codec 1620 is responsible for implementing all<br>
or a portion of the encoding and/or decoding processes<br>
described in reference to FIGS. 1-15. In some embodiments, the<br>
audio codec works in conjunction with hardware (e.g.,<br>
processor(s) 1602, audio subsystem 1606) to process audio<br>
signals, including encoding and/or decoding audio signals in<br>
accordance with the present invention described herein.<br>
The applications 1622 can include any software<br>
application related to audio content and/or where audio content<br>
is encoded and/or decoded, including but not limited to media<br>
players, music players (e.g., MP3 players), mobile phone<br>
applications, PDAs, television systems, set-top boxes, etc. In<br>
one embodiment, the audio codec can be used by an application<br>
service provider to provide encoding/decoding services over a<br>
network (e.g., the Internet).<br>
In the above description, for purposes of explanation,<br>
numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a<br>
thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent,<br>
however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be<br>
practiced without these specific details. In other instances,<br>
structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order<br>
to avoid obscuring the invention.<br>
In particular, one skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
other architectures and graphics environments may be used, and<br>
66<br><br>
that the present invention can be implemented using graphics<br>
tools and products other than those described above. In<br>
particular, the client/server approach is merely one example of<br>
an architecture for providing the dashboard functionality of<br>
the present invention; one skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that other, non-client/server approaches can also be used.<br>
Some portions of the detailed description are presented<br>
in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of<br>
operations on data bits within a computer memory. These<br>
algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used<br>
by those skilled in the data processing arts to most<br>
effectively convey the substance of their work to others<br>
skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally,<br>
conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to<br>
a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical<br>
manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not<br>
necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or<br>
magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined,<br>
compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient<br>
at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to<br>
these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters,<br>
terms, numbers, or the like.<br>

It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these<br>
and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate<br>
physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to<br>
these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as<br>
apparent from the discussion, it is appreciated that throughout<br>
the description, discussions utilizing terms such as<br>
"processing" or "computing" or "calculating" or "determining"<br>

that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical<br>
(electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers<br>
and memories into other data similarly represented as physical<br>
quantities within the computer system memories or registers or<br>
other such information storage, transmission or display devices.<br>
The present invention also relates to an apparatus for<br>
performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be<br>
specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may<br>

 Spatial information associated with an audio signal is encoded into a bitstream, which can be transmitted to a decoder<br>
or recorded to a storage media. The bitstream can include different syntax related to time, frequency and spatial domains. In some<br>
embodiments, the bitstream includes one or more data structures (e.g., frames) that contain ordered sets of slots for which parameters<br>
can be applied. The data structures can be fixed or variable. A data structure type indicator can be inserted in the bitstream to enable<br>
a decoder to determine the data structure type and to invoke an appropriate decoding process. The data structure can include position<br>
information that can be used by a decoder to identify the correct slot for which a given parameter set is applied. The slot position<br>
information can be encoded with either a fixed number of bits or a variable number of bits based on the data structure type as indicated<br>
by the data structure type indicator. For variable data structure types, the slot position information can be encoded with a variable<br>
number of bits based on the position of the slot in the ordered set of slots.<br></td>
