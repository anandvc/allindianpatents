Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention  relates to antibodies,   including binding fragments  thereof,   directed  to interleukin 25   (IL-25) . Preferred embodiments  of  the present invention employ the antibody VH and/or VL domains of the antibody 2C3.   In another aspect the invention provides one or more of the CDRs  of the VH and VL domains disclosed herein grafted into a human VH and VL framework regions,   respectively.<br>
Background to the  Invention<br>
Asthma is a common chronic  inflammatory disorder  of the airways. The number of sufferers  has   increased dramatically over  recent decades and the World Health Organisation estimates  that in the region of 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma. Allergic asthma is  characterised by uncontrollable airways hyperresponsiveness   (AHR)   induced by a variety of provocative stimuli and is associated with type-2 inflammatory infiltrates into the lungs.<br>
Type-2 cytokines play an   important role  in mediating protective immunity to parasitic helminth infection,   regulating effector functions such as  B cell  growth and IgE secretion,   inducing goblet cell hyperplasia  and  associated mucus production, eosinophilia,  mastocytosis and fibrosis   (I).     It is  the central roles played by these  cytokines in the regulation of these effector functions  that have made them key therapeutic targets in asthma.     Indeed,   mouse models in which these cytokines  are over-expressed show significant characteristics of asthma. Surprisingly then,   efforts   to ameliorate experimental  asthma by blocking specific type-2  cytokines have,   with the  exception of inhibiting  IL-13,   proven unsuccessful.<br>
Inhibition of IL-13   suppresses both AHR and airway  inflammation although the mechanism  remains unclear   (2,  3) .   However,   given the complex pathophysiology  and poorly understood etiology of asthma,   it  is uncertain whether targeting  individual pathways will ultimately prove  successful  therapeutically.<br>
Recently,   over-expression of IL-25/IL-17E,   a member of the structurally related   IL-17  cytokine family   (8),   has  been shown to induce type-2   responses  in vivo  (4-6)   and  increase responsiveness   to  airway agonists   (7).    I125-/- mice   failed to expel helminth parasites;   a key indicator of  an ineffectual type-2  response   (9,   10).<br>
The basic structure  of  an antibody is well known  in the art.    A naturally-occurring antibody usually has  four polypeptide chains:   two identical  heavy chains and two identical  light chains connected by disulphide bonds.     The heavy and light chains each have  a  constant region and a variable  region   (or domain) .     The variable  regions are primarily responsible  for antigen binding.   Within each variable region,   three  subregions, known as the complementarity-determining regions   (CDRs),  make contact with  the  antigen.     The CDRs of each variable  domain are numbered,   from the  N-terminal to the C-terminal,   as  CDR1,   CDR2 and CDR3.   Between  and N-  and C-terminal  to the  CRDs  are  four so-called framework  regions,   which make  few if any contacts with the antigen.     More  details regarding the structures  of antibodies are  illustrated in many of the documents   cited below, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Disclosure of  the   Invention<br>
The present  inventors  have produced antibodies  against  IL-25 and identified an antibody molecule which binds with high affinity and specificity to  IL-25.     Since human and mouse  IL-25  share 80% sequence identity  it  was believed that it would be   unlikely that it would be possible  to generate useful anti-IL-25  antibodies by conventional  immunisation of either mice or rats,   since the degree of similarity would reduce the number of  immunogenic epitopes.   Furthermore,   the receptor-ligand interface was  likely to show the greatest degree of conservation thereby precluding the generation of  antibodies capable of blocking  the  interaction of IL-25 with  its   receptor.  To overcome  these problems  the present inventors   immunised mice that had been  engineered to lack IL-25   (IL-25-/-)   expression with the belief  that  this approach would increase  the likelihood of developing antibodies directed against   the  IL-25/IL-25R interface.<br>
This approach was  highly successful at generating antibodies against  IL-25,   probably due to the IL-25  itself enhancing the humoral immune  response.  However,  even using  this approach only two blocking antibodies out of the seventy screened were identified,   and only one of these could be  recovered.<br>
Having overcome  the problem of the similarity between murine and human IL-25  which was believed to preclude  the generation of effective blocking antibodies through conventional means,   it is believed that  this  sequence similarity may allow the generation of an antibody which is equally effective at blocking mouse and human IL-25  interacting with their receptors.   The present invention now  shows  that this  is indeed the case.<br>
Although other antibodies to IL-25 are in existence the present invention is  believed to be the first demonstration of such antibodies  able  to block IL-25 bioactivity.      In particular,   the present disclosure provides test conducted in murine models of asthma which  show that an antibody of the  invention has advantageous  and unexpected properties,   especially its ability to prevent  or  reduce airway hyper responsiveness   in vivo,  a key symptom of  asthma.<br>
Although administration of a soluble  IL-25R-Fc  fusion protein has also been  reported to reduce type-2  airways  inflammation, the effects  were  less dramatic than those reported herein and critically AHR was not assessed   (11) .     We now demonstrate that IL-25 plays   critical  roles in airways inflammation and AHR, acting initially to enhance type-2 cytokine mediated inflammation,   but  also playing an important  role in the induction of AHR independently of the classical  type-2 cytokines.     The  identification of  IL-25-dependent AHR offers  the possibility of   identifying new therapeutic  targets  that lie downstream of  IL-25.     At present we do not   know whether IL-25 acts directly  on airways smooth muscle  to  induce broncho-constriction or  if its effects are mediated  through the induction  of  known bronchoconstrictors  such  as  the leukotrienes. However,   the biphasic activity of IL-25 makes  it an excellent<br><br>
therapeutic target for the suppression of  airway inflammation and the  inhibition of airways hyperresponsiveness in vivo.<br>
Accordingly,   the present invention relates   to the novel antibody,   and more generally target binding members comprising the antibody CDR sequences,   as well  as  the use of target binding members   in  the  treatment of conditions  such  as asthma.<br>
In one  embodiment,   the invention provides  a target binding member that binds  IL-25 and which comprises  an antibody VH domain comprising a VH CDR3 with the  amino  acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.   7.     Thi3   is  the VH CDR3 sequence  of  the  antibody 2C3 of the present  invention.<br>
In more specific embodiments, a target binding member of the invention is a VH domain which comprises a VH CDR3 of SEQ ID NO: 7   together  with a CDR1  of  SEQ ID NO: 5   and  a  CDR2  of SEQ ID<br>
NO:6.	<br>
The VH domain may have human framework regions, or the framework regions shown in SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
The VH domains may be paired with a VL domain of the invention, e.g. a VL domain with a CDR1 of SEQ ID NO:8, a CDR2 of SEQ ID NO:9 and a CDR3 of SEQ ID NO:10.  These CDRs may be in a VL domain having human frameworlc regions or may be the VL domain of SEQ ID NO:4.<br>
Thus in one aspect, the present invention provides a target binding member which binds IL-25 and which comprises the 2C3 VH domain (SEQ ID N0:2) and/or the 2C3 VL domain (SEQ ID NO:4).<br>
The invention also provides isolated nucleic acid encoding the target binding members of the invention, vectors comprising the nucleic acid and methods of expressing the nucleic acid in a host cell to produce target binding members of the invention.<br>
The invention further provides the use of target binding members of the invention, for example in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, for the treatment of diseases, including asthma.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention Target binding member<br>
This describes a member of a pair of molecules which have binding specificity for one another.  The members of a specific<br>
These and further aspects of. the invention are described in further detail below and with reference to the accompanying examples.<br>

binding pair may be naturally derived or wholly or partially synthetically produced.     One member of the pair of molecules has an area on its  surface,   or a cavity,  which specifically binds to and is therefore complementary to a particular spatial  and polar organisation of the other member of the pair of molecules.     Thus the members of the pair have the property of binding specifically to each other.     Examples of types of specific binding pairs are antigen-antibody,  biotin-avidin, hormone-hormone receptor,   receptor-ligand,   enzyme-substrate.<br>
This application is concerned with antigen-antibody type reactions.    Accordingly,   a target binding member of  the invention will comprise  at least a portion of an antibody molecule,  more particularly at least part of the antigen-binding domain of such a molecule.<br>
In general,   the heavy  chain variable region   (VH domain)   of an antibody plays a  significant role in the binding of an antibody to an antigen.     The CDR3  region of a VH domain has been  found to be more diverse than  the  CDR1 and CDR2  regions,   and thus   in most antibodies provides  specificity for the target of the antibody. Thus target binding members  of the invention are thus based around the VH CDR3  region of the 2C3 antibody.     Target  binding members of the invention more preferably comprise all  three CDRs of the VH regions  of  the  2C3  antibody.<br>
The structure of a target .binding member which comprises  a CDR of the invention will  generally be of a heavy or  light  chain sequence of an antibody molecule or substantial portion thereof in which  the CDR is  located at a location corresponding  to  the CDR of naturally occurring VH and VL antibody variable domains encoded by rearranged  immunoglobulin genes.     The  structures  and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains may be determined by reference to Kabat,   E.A.   et al,   Sequences of  Proteins  of Immunological  Interest.   4th Edition.  US Department of Health and Human Services.   1987,   and updates thereof.     A number  of academic and commercial  on-line  resources are available  to query this database.     For example,   see Martin,  A.C.R.   Accessing  the  Kabat Antibody Sequence  Database by Computer  PROTEINS:   Structure, Function and Genetics,   25   (1996),   130-133 and the  associated on-<br><br>
line resource,   currently at the web address of http: //www .bioinf. org. uk/abs/simkab. html.<br>
Generally,   a target binding member comprises a VH domain paired with a VL domain  to provide an antibody antigen binding domain, although as discussed  further below a VH domain alone may be used to bind antigen.   In one preferred embodiment,   the 2C3 VH domain   (SEQ ID NO.   2)   is paired with the 2C3 VL domain   (SEQ ID NO.   4),   so that  an antibody antigen binding  site  is   formed comprising both the  2C3 VH and VL domains.     In other embodiments,   the   2C3 VH is paired with a VL domain other than the 2C3 VL.<br>
Light-chain promiscuity is well established in the  art,   as discussed further herein.<br>
A target binding member according to the present  invention may bind IL-25 with an  affinity substantially similar  to  that of 2C3,   e.g.   +   10%.     A  target binding member will  generally be specific for  IL-25.     Thus  the target binding member will not show any significant binding to molecules other than  its specific binding partner(s).   For example,   it has  been  found that the 2C3 antibody does  not cross-react with IL-4,   IL-5  and IL-13 and thus avoidance  of such cross-reactivity to other cytokines implicated in asthma and similar processes is a desirable feature of target binding members of the invention.<br>
Typically,   specificity may be determined by means  of a binding assay such as  ELISA employing a panel of antigens.   A target binding member according to the present invention may recognise IL-25 and not other members of the IL-17  family,   particular any one of IL-17A,   IL-17B and IL-17C;  more preferably  all  three of IL-17A,   IL-17B and  IL-17C.     Binding of a target binding member according to the  invention with IL-25 may be  abolished by competition with  recombinant IL-25.<br>
Binding affinity and neutralisation potency of different target binding members  can be  compared under appropriate  conditions.<br>
Antibody molecule<br>
This describes   an  immunoglobulin whether natural  or partly or wholly synthetically produced.     It has been  shown  that fragments of a whole  antibody  can perform the function  of binding antigens.     Thus   reference to an antibody also covers any polypeptide  or protein comprising an antibody binding fragment.<br>
Examples of binding  fragments are   (i)   the  Fab  fragment consisting  of VL,   VH,   CL and CH1 domains;   (ii)   the  Fd fragment consisting of  the VH and CH1 domains;   (iii)   the  Fv fragment consisting  of  the VL and VH domains of a single  antibody;   (iv) the dAb fragment   (Ward,   E.S.  et al.,   Nature   341,   544-546   (1989)) which consists  of a VH domain;   (v)   isolated CDR  regions;   (vi) F(ab')2 fragments,   a bivalent fragment comprising  two  linked Fab fragments   (vii)   single chain Fv molecules   (scFv) ,   wherein a VH domain and a   VL domain are linked by a peptide   linker which allows the  two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site   (Bird et   al,   Science,  242,   423-426,   1988;   Huston et al, PNAS USA,   85,   5879-5883,   1988);   (viii)   bispecific  single chain Fv dimers   (PCT/OS92/09965)  and  (ix)   "diabodies",   multivalent or multispecific   fragments constructed by gene   fusion   (WO94/13804; P.  Holliger  et  al,   Proc.   Natl.  Acad.   Sci.   USA   90   6444-6448, 1993) .     Fv,   scFv  or diabody molecules may be  stabilised by the incorporation  of disulphide bridges linking  the  VH and VL domains   (Y.   Reiter  et  al,  Nature Biotech,   14,   1239-1245,   1996). Minibodies  comprising  a scFv joined to a CH3  domain may also be made   (S.   Hu  et  al,   Cancer Res.,   56,   3055-3061,   1996).<br>
Where bispecific  antibodies are to be used,   these may be conventional  bispecific antibodies,  which can be manufactured in a variety of ways   (Holliger,  P.  and Winter G.   Current Opinion Biotechnol.   4,   44 6-449   (1993)),  e.g.  prepared  chemically or from hybrid hybridomas,   or may be any of the bispecific antibody fragments mentioned above.    Diabodies and scFv can be constructed without an Fc region,  using only variable domains, potentially  reducing the effects of anti-idiotypic reaction.<br>
Bispecific  diabodies,   as opposed to bispecific whole antibodies, may also be particularly useful because they  can be readily constructed and  expressed in E.  coll.     Diabodies   (and many other<br>
polypeptides  such as  antibody fragments)   of appropriate binding specificities   can be  readily selected using phage  display (WO94/13804)   from libraries.     If one arm of  the diabody is to be kept constant,   for  instance,  with a specificity directed against IL-25,  then a  library can be made where the other arm is varied and an antibody of appropriate specificity selected.     Bispecific whole antibodies  may be made by knobs-into-holes  engineering   (J. B.  B.  Ridgeway et  al,   Protein Eng.,   9,   616-621,   1996). It is possible  to  take monoclonal and other antibodies  and use techniques of  recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or  chimeric molecules which retain the  specificity of the original  antibody.     Such techniques may involve  introducing DNA encoding the  immunoglobulin variable region,   or the complementarity determining regions   (CDRs) ,   of an antibody to the constant  regions,   or constant regions plus   framework regions,   of a different immunoglobulin.     See,   for  instance,   EP-A-184187,   GB  2188638A or EP-A-239400.<br>
Preferably the CDR regions are grafted into a human  framework region.    The human  framework region may be selected by a number of methods,   e.g.   by comparing the mouse  framework region or mouse V region sequences with known human framework or V region sequences and  selecting a human framework region which has the highest,   or one  of the highest degrees of amino acid similarity or identity.     Modifications to framework regions  of native human sequences may be made in order to further optimize the resulting CDR-grafted antibodies.<br>
Although in  a preferred aspect of the invention antibody molecules  comprising a pair of VH and VL domains  are preferred, single binding domains based  VH or VL domain sequences form further  aspects of the invention.     It is   known  that single immunoglobulin domains,  especially VH domains,   are capable of binding target  antigens in a specific manner.<br>
In the case  of  either of the single chain binding domains,   these domains may- be used  to screen for complementary domains capable of forming a  two-domain target binding member able  to bind IL-25,   as discussed  further herein below.<br><br>
Antibody molecules of the present invention may further comprise antibody constant regions or parts thereof.  For example, a VL domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light chain constant domains including human Cx or CX chains, preferably CX chains. Similarly, a target binding member based on a VH domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to all or part of an immunoglobulin heavy chain derived from any antibody isotype, e.g. IgG, IgA, IgE and IgM and any of the isotype subclasses, particularly IgGl and IgG4. IgG4 is preferred. Fc regions such as Anab and Anac as disclosed in WO99/58572 may be employed.<br>
Chimeric molecules comprising an target binding domain, or equivalent, fused to another polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are described in EP-A-0120694 and EP-A-0125023.<br>
Framework regions of antibody molecules of the invention may also include glycosylation sequences that include one or more glycosylation sites.  Depending upon the host cell in which the target binding member is expressed, the pattern of glycosylation may vary. Thus nucleic acid constructs that encode glycosylation sites may be modified to remove the site or alternatively such sites may be introduced into the protein. For example, N-glycosylation sites in eukaryotic proteins are characterized by an amino acid triplet Asn-X-Y, wherein X is any amino acid except Pro and Y is Ser or Thr. Appropriate substitutions, additions or deletions to the nucleotide sequence encoding these triplets will result in prevention of attachment of carbohydrate residues at the Asn side chain. Alteration of a single nuletide, chosen so that Asn is replaced by a different amino acid, for example, is sufficient to inactivate an N-glycosylation site. Known procedures for inactivating N-glycosylation sites in proteins include those described in U.S. Pat. No.'5,071,972 and EP 276,846.<br>
Antigen-binding domain<br>
This describes the part of an antibody molecule which comprises the area which specifically binds to and is complementary to part or all of an antigen.  Where an antigen is large, an<br>
antibody may only bind  to a particular part  of the  antigen, which part  is  termed an epitope.    An antigen binding domain may be provided by one  or more antibody variable domains   (e.g.   a so-called Fd antibody  fragment consisting of a VH domain) . Preferably,   an antigen binding domain comprises  at  least a substantial portion  of an antibody light chain variable region (VL)   and at  least  a  substantial portion of an antibody heavy chain variable  region   (VH).<br>
A substantial portion of an immunoglobulin variable domain will comprise at  least  the three CDR regions,   together with  their intervening  framework regions.     Preferably,   the portion will also include  at   least about 50% of either or both of  the first and fourth  framework regions,   the 50% being the C-terminal  50% of the first   framework region and the N-terminal   50%  of the fourth framework  region.     Additional residues  at  the  N-terminal or C-terminal   end  of the substantial part of the variable domain may be those not  normally associated with naturally occurring variable domain regions.     For example,  construction  of target binding members  of   the present invention made by recombinant DNA techniques may result  in the introduction of N-  or  C-terminal residues encoded by  linkers introduced to  facilitate  cloning or other manipulation  steps.  Other manipulation steps   include the introduction of  linkers  to join variable domains  of the invention  to  further protein sequences including  immunoglobulin heavy chains,   other variable domains   (for example   in the production  of  diabodies)   or protein labels as  discussed in more details below.<br>
Comprise<br>
This is generally  used in the sense of include,   that  is to say permitting  the presence of one or more features  or  components.<br>
Isolated<br>
This refers  to  the  state in which target binding members of the invention,   or  nucleic acid encoding such binding members,   will generally be  in  accordance with the present  invention.     Members and nucleic acid will be free or substantially  free of material with which they are  naturally associated such as  other<br>
polypeptides  or nucleic acids with which they are  found in their natural  environment,   or the environment  in which they are prepared   (e.g.   cell  culture)   when such preparation is by recombinant DNA technology practised  in vitro or  in vivo.<br>
Target binding members and nucleic acid may be  formulated with diluents  or  adjuvants and still  for practical purposes be isolated -  for  example the members will  normally be mixed with gelatin or other carriers  if used to coat microtitre plates for use in immunoassays,  or will be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable  carriers or diluents when used in diagnosis  or therapy.     Target binding members may be glycosylated,   either naturally or by systems of heterologous eukaryotic cells   (e.g. CHO or NSO   (ECACC  85110503)   cells,   or they may be   (for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic  cell)   unglycosylated.<br>
Additional Features of target binding members.<br>
In addition  to antibody sequences,   a target binding member according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids,   e.g.   forming a peptide or polypeptide,   such as a folded domain,   or  to  impart to the molecule another  functional characteristic  in addition to ability to bind antigen.    Target binding members  of the invention may carry a detectable label, or may. be  conjugated to a toxin or enzyme   (e.g.   via a peptidyl bond or  linker).<br>
Detectable  labels  include radiolabels  such as   131I  or 99Tc,  which may be attached to antibodies of the invention using conventional chemistry known in the art  of antibody imaging. Labels  also  include enzyme labels such as horseradish peroxidase.     Labels further include chemical moieties such as biotin which may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable moiety,   e.g.  labelled avidin.<br>
Where the  additional  feature is a polypeptide domain or label, the target binding member may be produced by  recombinant techniques,   i.e.   by the expression of  nucleic acid encoding a fusion of  the  target binding member and the   further domain.<br>
Further target binding members of the Invention<br>
Sequence  Variants Variants  of  the VH  and VL domains and CDRs  of which the sequences  are   set  out herein and which can be  employed in target binding members   for  IL-25 can be obtained by means of methods of sequence alteration or mutation and screening.     Such methods are also provided by  the present invention.<br>
A target binding member according to the invention may also be one whieh competes  for binding to antigen with any target binding member  which both binds the antigen and  comprises a target binding member,  VH and/or VL domain disclosed herein,  or VH CDR3,   of  2C3,   or  a variant of any of these whose  sequence is substantially  as  set out herein.    Thus,   a  further aspect of the present  invention  provides a target binding member comprising a human antibody antigen-binding site which competes with 2C3 for binding to IL-25.   Competition between binding members may be assayed easily  in vitro,  for example using ELISA and/or by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected  in  the presence of other untagged binding member(s),   to enable  identification of target  binding members which bind the  same epitope or an overlapping  epitope.<br>
Various methods  are available in the art for  obtaining target binding members  against IL-25 and which may compete with 2C3  for binding to  IL-25.<br>
Variable domain amino acid sequence variants  of any of the VH and VL domains  whose  sequences are specifically disclosed herein may be employed  in accordance with the present  invention,   as discussed.     Particular variants may include  one or more amino acid sequence  alterations   (addition,  deletion,   substitution and/or insertion  of an amino acid residue),   maybe  less  than about 20 alterations,   less than about  15 alterations,   less than about 10 alterations or less than about  5  alterations,   4,   3,   2 or 1.    Alterations may be made in one or more  framework regions and/or one  or more CDR's.<br>
In one aspect,   a  CDR amino acid sequence  substantially as set out herein  is   carried as a CDR in a human variable domain or a<br>
substantial portion thereof. The VH CDR3 sequences substantially as set out herein represent preferred embodiments of the present invention and it is preferred that each of these is carried as a VH CDR3 in a human heavy chain variable domain or a substantial portion thereof.<br>
By "substantially as set out" it is meant that the relevant CDR or VH or VL domain of the invention will be either identical or highly similar to the specified regions of which the sequence is set out herein.  By "highly similar" it is contemplated that from 1 to 5, preferably from 1 to 4 such as 1 to 3 or 1 or 2, or 3 or 4, amino acid substitutions may be made in the CDR and/or VH or VL domain.<br>
Sequence variants of target binding members of the invention may be generated by carrying out random mutagenesis of one or both of the 2C3 VH and/or VL genes to generate mutations within the entire variable domain.  Such a technique is described by Gram et al (1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 89:3576-3580), who used error-prone PCR.<br>
Another method which may be used is to direct mutagenesis to CDR regions of VH or VL genes.  Such techniques are disclosed by Barbas et al, (1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 91:3809-3813) and Schier et al (1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-567).<br>
All the above described techniques are known as such in the art and in themselves do not form part of the present invention. The skilled person will be able to use such techniques to provide target binding members of the invention using' routine methodology in the art.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect the invention provides a method for obtaining an antibody against IL-25 which comprises:<br>
providing a starting nucleic acid encoding a target binding member that has one or more of the CDR sequences of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO: 4;<br>
modifying said nucleic acid to alter the CDR sequence or sequences;<br>
expressing said modified target binding member; and<br>
testing said modified target binding member for binding against IL-25.<br>
Preferably the modification will be performed on a plurality of starting nucleic acid molecules  to provide a repertoire of modified sequences having a diversity of binding affinities.<br>
In one aspect,   the starting nucleic acid comprises all three heavy chain CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 2,   either in the  form of  SEQ  ID NO: 2 itself or carried in another  framework sequence.<br>
In one embodiment,   the modifications may be directed at a  single CDR,   e.g.  the CDR3,   or the modifications may be directed to two or three CDR regions simultaneously.<br>
Production of CDR3-based Target Binding Members Variable domains employed in the  invention may be obtained  from any germ-line or rearranged human variable domain,  or may be a synthetic variable domain based on consensus  sequences  of known human variable domains.     A CDR sequence of the invention   (e.g. CDR3)   may be  introduced into a  repertoire of variable domains lacking a CDR   {particularly  CDR3),   using recombinant  Dl® technology.<br>
For example,   Marks et al   (Bio/Technology,   1992,   10:779-183)   -describe methods of producing repertoires of antibody variable domains in which consensus primers directed at or adjacent to the 5'  end of the variable domain axea are used in conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework region of human VH genes to provide a repertoire of VH variable domains lacking a CDR3.    Marks et al further describe how this repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular antibody.     Using analogous techniques,   the CDR3-derived sequences of the present invention may be shuffled with repertoires  of VH or VL domains  lacking a CDR3,   and the shuffled complete VH or VL domains combined with a cognate VL or VH domain to provide target binding members  of the invention.     The repertoire may then be displayed in a  suitable host system such as  the phage display system of WO92/01047  so that suitable  target binding members  may be selected.     A<br>
repertoire may consist of from anything from 104 individual members upwards,   for example from 106 to 108 or  1010 members.<br>
Analogous shuffling or  combinatorial techniques are also disclosed by Stemmer   (Nature,   1994,  370:389-391),   who describes the technique in relation  to a  ß-lactamase gene but  observes that the approach may be  used  for the generation of antibodies.<br>
A further aspect of the invention thus provides a method of preparing a target binding member specific for IL-25, which method comprises:<br>
(a)	providing  a  starting repertoire of nucleic  acids<br>
encoding a VH domain which either include a CDR3 to be  replaced<br>
or lack a CDR3 encoding  region;<br>
(b)	combining  said repertoire with a donor nucleic acid<br>
encoding an amino acid sequence substantially as  set  out herein<br>
for a VH CDR3  such  that   said donor nucleic acid is  inserted into<br>
the CDR3 region in  the  repertoire,  so as to provide a product<br>
repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH domain;<br>
(c)	expressing the nucleic acids of said product<br>
repertoire;<br>
(d)	selecting a target binding member specific  for  a IL-<br>
25;  and<br>
(e)	recovering said target binding member or nucleic acid<br>
encoding it.<br>
The product repertoire may be co-expressed,   from the  same vector or different vector,   with a VL domain.    The VL domain may be the VL domain of the present  invention or may be one or more different VL domains,   as described below in relation to chain shuffling.<br>
An analogous method may be  employed in which a VL CDR3  of  the invention is combined with a repertoire of nucleic  acids encoding a VL domain which either include a CDR3  to be  replaced or lack, a CDR3 encoding  region.    As with the method above,   the VL product repertoire may be co-expressed,   from the  same vector or different vector,   with a VH domain.     The VH domain may be the VH domain of the present  invention or may be one  or more<br>
different VH domains,   as described below in  relation to chain shuffling.<br>
Similarly,   one   or more,   or all three CDRs may be  grafted into a repertoire  of VH or VL domains which are  then  screened for a target binding member or target binding members  specific for IL-25.<br>
Target binding members obtained in this manner  form a further aspect of the  invention.<br>
Chain  Shuffling A further aspect of the invention provides a method for obtaining an  antibody antigen-binding domain  for  IL-25,   the method comprising providing combining a VH domain  of a target binding member  of  the invention   (including variants  as discussed above)   with one or more VL domains,   and testing  the VH/VL combination  or  combinations for antibody-antigen binding domain for IL-25.<br>
Said VL domain may have an amino acid sequence  which is substantially as   set out herein.<br>
An analogous method may be employed in which  one  or more sequence variants   of a VL domain disclosed herein  are combined with one or more VH domains.<br>
This may be  achieved by phage display screening methods using the so-called hierarchical dual combinatorial  approach as disclosed  in WO92/01047 in which an individual  colony containing either an H or  L chain clone is used to infect a complete library of clones encoding the other chain   (L or H)   and the . resulting  two-chain target binding member  is   selected in accordance  with phage display techniques  such  as  those described in that  reference.<br>
Thus the present   invention provides a method for selection of an antibody molecule   for IL-25,   the method comprising:<br>
(a)   providing a VH domain comprising  a  target binding member that binds   IL-25 and which comprises  an  antibody VH<br>
domain comprising a VH CDR3 with the amino  acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.   7;<br>
(b)	combining said VH domain with a plurality of antibody VL domains   to provide antibody molecules;<br>
(c)	screening said antibody molecules  for binding to IL-25; and<br>
(d)	selecting an antibody molecule which binds  IL-25.<br>
The VH and VL domains may be provided in the  form of proteins expressed by  recombinant DNA, particularly by a phage or phagemid  DNA.<br>
The plurality of VL domains may be anything  from 104 individual domains  upwards,   for example from 106 to  108  or  1010 domains.<br>
Antibody molecules,   and nucleic acid encoding such molecules, may form a  further part of the present invention.<br>
IL-25	~<br>
11-25,   also  referred to in the art as  IL-17E,   is available  from commercial  sources   (e.g.   R£D Systems,   MN,   USA)   or may be cloned or synthesised by  reference to the  sequences  of  IL-25 available in the  art.     Murine IL-25   (NCBI Protein NP_5427 67)   is described-by Hurst   et  al,   2002   (Ref.   7 below).     Human  IL-25   (NCBI  Protein Q9H293)   is  described by Fort et al   (Ref.   4 below).     For production of  antibodies or use in immunoassays,   fragments of recombinant   IL-25 may be used,  particularly those  truncated at the N-terminal.     For example,   commercially available recombinant human  IL-25   (IL-17E)   comprises the mature protein sequence of Tyr 33  -  Gly  177  of Accession No.  Q9H293)   and commercially „ available murine   IL-25 comprises residues Val   17  - Ala 169 of mouse  IL-17E   (Accession No.   NP_542767) .<br>
Nucleic Acids and Vectors<br>
In further  aspects,  the invention provides  an isolated nucleic acid which  comprises a sequence encoding a  target binding member,   a  VH  domain,   or VL domain according  to  the present invention,   and methods of preparing a  target binding member,   a VH domain,   or  a VL domain of the invention,   which comprise<br>
expressing said nucleic acid under conditions to bring about production of said target binding member, VH domain, or VL domain, and recovering it.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides nucleic acid, generally isolated, encoding a VH CDR or VL CDR sequence disclosed herein, especially a VH CDR selected from SEQ ID NOs: 5, 6 and 7, a VL CDR selected from SEQ ID NOs: 8, 9 and 10, most preferably 2C3 VH CDR3 (SEQ ID NO. 7) .<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention may comprise the sequences, or relevant portions thereof (e.g. CDR-encoding regions) of SEQ ID NO:l or SEQ ID NO:3. However, codon usage may be varied, e.g. to optimize expression of the sequence in a desired host cell.<br>
The present invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a target binding member of the present invention. Nucleic acid includes DNA and RNA.  In a preferred aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid which codes for a CDR or VH or VL domain of the invention as defined above.<br>
Nucleic acid according to the present invention may comprise DNA or RNA and may be wholly or partially synthetic. Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence, and encompasses a" RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is substituted for T, unless context requires otherwise.<br>
The present invention also provides vectors, for example in the form of plasmids, viruses, e.g. 'phage, or phagemid, cosmids, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at least one nucleic acid as above.<br>
Suitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, containing appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequesces, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate.  For further details see, for example, Molecular Cloning: a<br>
Laboratory Manual: 2nd edition, Sambrook et al., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.<br>
Vectors of the invention also include viral vectors capable of infecting human cells in vivo,   e.g. adenoviral, retroviral or adeno-associated virus vectors.  Such vectors may be useful for expression of a target binding member of the invention in the cells of a human or animal subject, to provide for production and delivery of the target binding member to said subject.<br>
A nucleic acid sequence encoding a target binding member of the invention will in one aspect be operably linked to a promoter to effect expression of the target binding member in a host cell. The sequence may include at its 5' end a leader sequence to facilitate expression and/or secretion of the target binding member in and/or from a host cell.  Numerous suitable leader sequences are known as such in the art and may be selected by a person of ordinary skill in the art taking account of the host cell.<br>
Many, known techniques and protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example in preparation of nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells and gene expression, and analysis of proteins, are described in detail in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Second Edition, Ausubel et al. eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992. The disclosures of Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Host Cells and Production of Target Binding Members<br>
A further aspect provides a host cell transformed with a nucleic acid (e.g. a nucleic acid sequence in the form of a vector) of the invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the nucleic acid of the invention is integrated into the genome (e.g. chromosome) of the host cell. Integration may be promoted by inclusion of sequences which promote recombination with the genome, in accordance with standard techniques.<br>
A yet  further  aspect provides a method of production of an target binding member of the invention,   the method including causing  expression  from encoding nucleic acid.     Such a method may comprise culturing host cells under conditions  for production of  said target binding member.<br>
Following production by expression a VH or VL domain,   or target binding member may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable  technique,   then used as appropriate.     A method of production may comprise a step of isolation and/or purification of the product.<br>
Following- purification of the product the  target binding member may be modified by physical or chemical means,   for example to introduce protective groups that alter,   e.g.   increase,   the stability or biological half-life of the protein.     For example, PEGylation  of proteins to achieve such effects  is  known as such in the art and target binding members of  the  invention may be in PEGylated form.<br>
A method of production may comprise  formulating  the product into a composition  including at  least one additional  component,   such as a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
The present  invention also provides  a  recombinant host cell which comprises  one or nucleic acids or vectors as above.    A nucleic acid encoding any CDR,   VH or VL domain,   or target binding member as provided itself forms  an aspect of the present invention,   as  does a method of production of  the encoded product,   which method comprises expression  from encoding nucleic acid therefor.<br>
Systems  for  cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells are well known.     Suitable host cells include bacteria,   mammalian cells,   yeast and baculovirus systems.     Mammalian cell lines available  in  the  art for expression  of a heterologous polypeptide  include Chinese hamster ovary cells,   HeLa cells,  baby hamster kidney cells, NS0 mouse melanoma  cells,   YB2/0 rat myeloma cells  and many others.     A common,preferred bacterial  host is  E.   coli.<br>
• The expression of  antibodies and antibody fragments  in prokaryotic cells  such  as E.   coli is well established in the art.     For a review,   see   for example Pluckthun,  A.   Bio/Technology 9:  545-551   (1991).     Expression in eukaryotic cells  in culture is also available to  those  skilled in the art as an option for production of a target binding member,   see for recent  reviews, for example Ref,   M.E.    (1993)   Curr. Opinion Biotech.   4:   573-576; Trill J.J.   et  al.    (1995)   Curr.   Opinion Biotech  6:   553-560.<br>
Compositions<br>
Thus pharmaceutical  compositions according to the present invention,   and for use  in accordance with the present invention, may comprise,   in addition to active ingredient,   a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient,   carrier,   buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those  skilled in the art.     Such materials  should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient.     The precise nature of  the  carrier or other material will  depend on the route of administration,   which may be oral,   or by  injection, e.g.   intravenous.<br>
Therapeutic formulations of the target binding member may be prepared for storage by mixing the target binding member having the desired degree  of  purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers,   excipients,  or stabilizers   (see  e.g. "Remington:  The  Science and Practice of Pharmacy",   20th Edition, 2000,   pub.  Lippincott,   Williams &amp; Wilkins.),   in the  form of lyophilized powder or aqueous solutions.     Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers  are nontoxic to recipients at  the dosages and concentrations  employed,   and include buffers  such as phosphate,   citrate,   and other organic acids;   antioxidants including ascorbic  acid;   low molecular weight   (less  than about 10 residues)   polypeptides;   proteins,   such as  serum albumin, gelatin,   or immunoglobulins;  hydrophilic polymers  such  as polyvinylpyrrolidone;   amino acids such as glycine,   glutamine, asparagine,   arginine  or   lysine; monosaccharides,   disaccharides, and other carbohydrates   including glucose,  mannose,   or dextrins; chelating agents   such as  EDTS;  sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol;   salt-forming counterions  such as  sodium;   and/or<br>
nonionic  surfactants  such as Tween,   Pluronics or polyethylene glycol   (PEG).<br>
For  the  target binding member to be  used for in vivo administration it must be sterile.   This  is  readily accomplished by filtration through sterile  filtration membranes,  prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.  The target binding member  ordinarily will be stored  in  lyophilized form or in solution.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions  for oral  administration may be  in tablet,   capsule,  powder or liquid  form.     A tablet may comprise a solid carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant.    Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such  as  water,   petroleum,   animal  or vegetable oils,  mineral oil or  synthetic oil.     Physiological  saline  solution,  dextrose or other   saccharide solution or glycols   such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included.<br>
For  intravenous injection,   or injection at the site of affliction,   the active  ingredient  will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous   solution which is pyrogen-free and has  suitable pH,   isotonicity and stability.    Those of relevant  skill in the art are well  able  to prepare suitable solutions using,   for example,   isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride  Injection,   Ringer's Injection,   Lactated Ringer's Injection.     Preservatives,   stabilisers,   buffers,   antioxidants and/or other additives may be  included,   as required.<br>
Therapeutic Vsas of the Invention<br>
The  present invention provides  for  the first time a demonstration that antibodies  against  IL-25 are effective in preventing or reducing airway hyperresponsiveness  in vivo,   a key symptom of asthma.     Thus  in one  aspect  the invention provides  a method of preventing or reducing airway hyperresponsiveness  in a subject   (e.g.   a human)   in need of  treatment which comprises administering to the subject  a  target binding member, particularly an antibody molecule,   that binds IL-25.   In another aspect  the  invention provides  a method of preventing,   reducing or  treating asthma  in a  subject  in need of treatment which<br>
comprises administering  to the  subject a target binding member, particularly an antibody molecule,   that binds IL-25.<br>
The above methods may be  practiced with target binding members (including compositions  thereof)   according to the present invention,   which are useful   in binding to and preferably antagonising action of  IL-25,   with therapeutic potential  in various diseases and disorders  in which IL-25 plays a role.     The methods may also be practiced with other target binding members (including compositions  thereof)   which bind IL-25 that may be obtained as described below  in the accompanying examples.<br>
Target binding members   (including compositions thereof) according to the invention may be used in a method of treatment (including prophylactic treatment)   or diagnosis in human or animal subject.     Such a method of treatment or diagnosis   (which may include prophylactic  treatment)  may comprise administering to said subject an effective  amount of a target binding member of the invention.     Exemplary diseases and disorders  are discussed further below.<br>
Also provided is the use  of  a  target binding member   (including a compositions thereof)   of  the  invention in the manufacture  of a medicament for administration,   to a human or animal  subject.<br>
Clinical indications  in which an anti-IL-25 target binding member may be used to provide  therapeutic benefit include  any condition in which IL-25  has pathological consequences.     Thus  in general,   the target binding member of the invention may be used in the treatment of any condition associated with an unwanted Th-2 response.    For example the a target binding member of the invention may be used  for  the treatment of allergy and asthma, particularly asthma.<br>
Anti-IL-25 treatment may be   given by injection  (e.g. intravenously)   or by local  delivery methods.    Anti-IL-25 may be delivered by gene-mediated  technologies.   Alternative  formulation strategies may provide  preparations suitable for oral  or suppository route. The  route of administration may be  determined by the physicochemical  characteristics of  the treatment,   by<br>
special considerations  for  the disease,   to optimise efficacy or to minimise side-effects.<br>
In accordance with the  present  invention,  compositions  provided may be administered to  individuals.    Administration  is preferably in a  "therapeutically effective amount",   this being sufficient to show benefit to a patient.     Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at  least one symptom.    The actual  amount administered,   and  rate and time-course of administration,   will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment,   e.g.   decisions on dosage  etc,   is within the responsibility of  general practitioners  and  other medical doctors.     Appropriate doses of antibody are well  known in the art;   see Ledermann  J.A.   et al.   (1991)   Int.   J.   Cancer 47: 659-664;  Bagshawe  K.D.   et al.    (1991)   Antibody,   Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals  4:   915-922.<br>
The precise dose will  depend upon a number of factors,   including whether the antibody  is   for diagnosis or  for treatment,   the size and location of  the  area  to be treated,   the precise nature of the antibody   (e.g.   whole  antibody,  fragment or diabody) ,   and the nature of any detectable  label or other molecule attached to the antibody.  A typical  antibody dose will be in the  range   0.5mg -1.0g,   and this may be  administered as a bolus  intravenously. Other modes of administration include intravenous   infusion over several hours,   to achieve  a  similar total cumulative dose.  This is a dose for a  single  treatment of an adult patient,   which may be proportionally adjusted  for children and infants,   and also adjusted for other  antibody  formats in proportion  to molecular weight.  Treatments may be  repeated at daily,   twice-weekly, weekly or monthly intervals,   at the discretion of the physician.<br>
A further mode of administration employs precoating  of,   or otherwise incorporation into,   indwelling devices,   for which the optimal amount  of antibody will be determined by means   of appropriate experiments.<br>
An antibody molecule  in  some preferred embodiments of  the invention is a monomeric   fragment,  such as  F(ab)   or  scFv.   Such antibody fragments may have  the advantage of a relatively short<br><br>
half life  and less risk of platelet activation,   which may be caused by  receptor clustering.   Clustering which gives rise to platelet activation could be either of  117-25 molecules or of IL-25 with  FcRH molecules,   for instance.<br>
If a whole  antibody,  is used,   it is preferably in a form that is unable  to activate and/or destroy platelets.     The IgG4 isotype or alternatively '"designer"  isotypes derived  from the IgGl backbone   (novel  Fc gene constructs W099/58572,   Clark,  Armour, Williamson)   are preferred choices.     Smaller antibody fragments may be used,   such as F(ab')2.   In addition,   whole antibodies or fragments   (e.g.   F(ab')2 or diabodies)   with dual epitope specificity   (e.g.   for the epitopes recognised by scFv 2C3)  may be used.   Although such an embodiment may promote receptor clustering,   a high association rate  to individual receptors may rule out  this problem.<br>
Target binding members- of the present  invention will usually be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical  composition,  which may comprise at least one component  in addition to the target binding member.<br>
A target binding member of the invention may be administered alone or in  combination with other treatments,   either simultaneously or sequentially dependent  upon  the condition to be treated.     Other treatments may include the administration of suitable doses of pain relief drugs  such as  non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs   (e.g.  asprin,  paracetamol,   ibuprofen or ketoprofen)   or opiates such as morphine;   the  administration of anti-emetics;   or the administration of at  least one other compound active against asthma,   generally a bronchodilating agent which produces airway relaxation or enhances mucus clearance,   e.g.   a beta-agonist   (e.g.   salbutamol,   salmeterol), disodium cromoglycate,   steroids or an  inhibitor of PDEIV-<br>
Assay Methods<br>
The present  invention provides a method comprising causing or allowing binding of a target binding member as provided herein to  IL-25.     As  noted,   such binding may  take place in vivo-,   e.g. following administration of a target  binding member,   or nucleic<br>
acid encoding a target binding member,   or it may take place in vitro,   for example  in ELISA,  Western blotting,   immuno-cytochemistry,   immuno-precipitation or affinity chromatography.<br>
The amount of binding of  target binding member to  IL-25 may be determined.     Quantitation may be related to the amount  of  the antigen in a test  sample,   which may be of diagnostic interest.<br>
The reactivities  of antibodies on a sample may be determined by any appropriate means.     Radioimmunoassay   (RIA)   is one possibility.    Radioactive  labelled antigen is mixed with unlabelled antigen   (the  test sample)   and allowed to bind to the antibody.    Bound  antigen  is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount  of radioactive antigen bound  to the antibody determined.     The more antigen there is  in  the  test sample the less  radioactive antigen will bind to the  antibody. A competitive binding  assay may also be used with nonradioactive antigen,   using antigen or an analogue  linked to a reporter molecule.     The  reporter molecule may be a  fluorochrome, phosphor or laser  dye  with spectrally isolated absorption or emission characteristics.     Suitable fluorochromes  include fluorescein,   rhodamine,   phycoerythrin and Texas Red.     Suitable chromogenic dyes   include diaminobenzidine.<br>
Other reporters  include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material  such as latex beads  that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic,   and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed,   electronically detected or  otherwise recorded.    These molecules may be enzymes which catalyse reactions that develop  or change colours or cause changes  in electrical properties,   for example.     They may be molecularly excitable,   such that  electronic transitions between energy states  result in  characteristic spectral absorptions  or emissions.    They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors.     Biotin/avidin or<br>
biotin/streptavidin  and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed.<br>
The signals  generated by individual antibody-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or  relative data of the relevant  antibody binding in samples   (normal  and test).<br>
The present  invention also provides  the use of a  target binding member as above  for measuring antigen levels  in a competition assay,   that  is  to  say a method of measuring the level of antigen in a sample by employing a target binding member as provided by the present  invention in a competition assay.     This may be where the physical  separation of bound from unbound antigen is not required.     Linking  a  reporter molecule to the  target binding member so that  a physical or optical change occurs on binding is one possibility.     The reporter molecule may directly or indirectly generate detectable,   and preferably measurable, signals.     The  linkage of reporter molecules may be directly or indirectly,   covalently,   e.g.  via a peptide bond or non-covalently.     Linkage via a peptide bond may be  as  a result of recombinant  expression of a gene fusion encoding antibody and reporter molecule.<br>
The present   invention also provides  for measuring   levels of antigen directly,   by employing a target binding member according to the invention  for example in a biosensor system.<br>
The mode of determining binding is not a  feature  of the present invention and those  skilled in the art are able to choose a suitable mode according to their preference and general knowledge.<br>
The present  invention further extends to a target binding member which -competes  for binding to IL-25 with any target binding member which both binds the antigen and comprises  a V domain including a CDR with amino acid substantially as  set out herein or a V domain with, amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein.     Competition between binding members may be assayed easily in vitro,   for  example by tagging a specific  reporter molecule  to one-binding member which can be  detected in the presence of other  untagged binding member(s),   to enable identification of  target binding members which bind the same<br>
epitope or an overlapping epitope.   Competition may be determined for example  using ELISA or flow cytometry.<br>
A competition  reaction may be used to  select  one or more target binding members  such as derivatives of 2C3,   which may have one or more  additional or improved properties.   This  is analogous to the selection method for 2C3 in accordance with the invention, except  that  IL-25 is not eluted from its mini-ligand but from an antibody molecule.  This may be important  as  it  should yield a greater proportion of daughter antibodies  which directly compete with the parent.   Indeed such daughter antibodies as are selected may have a greater affinity for the antigen than the parent (allowing  for enhancements in avidity which may result from the display of more than one antibody molecule per phage).  Current methods  of  selecting for "daughter" phage antibodies of improved affinity include:<br>
using  concentrations of   (labelled)   target  antigen lower than  the dissociation constant of the  original parent antibody;<br>
using excess .unlabelled target antigen  as a competitor as demonstrated  in Hawkins et al   (1992) .   However,   they do not necessarily  specify that the  "improved"   antibody roust displace/occupy the same epitope as  the parent.   Incorporating the elution  step should yield a higher proportion of daughter antibodies  which do displace the parent.   Daughter antibodies selected  in   this  way may bind a very  similar  epitope to the parent antibody,   but with a greater affinity.<br>
In testing  for competition a peptide  fragment of the antigen may be employed,   especially a peptide including an epitope of interest.     A peptide having the epitope sequence plus one or more amino acids at either end may be used.     Such a peptide may be  said to "consist essentially"  of  the  specified sequence. Target binding members according to the present  invention may be such that  their binding  for antigen  is   inhibited by a peptide with or  including  the sequence given.     In  testing for this,   a peptide  with either sequence plus one   or more amino acids may be used.<br>
Target binding members which bind a specific peptide may be isolated for example from a phage display library by panning with the peptide(s).<br>
Examples<br>
Aspects  and embodiments of the present  invention will now be illustrated by way of example with  reference to the  following experimentation.<br>
Example 1:  Generation of Antibodies against IL-25<br>
A large panel of antibodies,   generated in H25-/- mice immunised against murine IL-25   (R&amp;D Systems),   was  screened.  One of these-anti-IL-25 antibodies   (2C3)   was   found to inhibit both the interaction between rmIL-25  and a  soluble mIL-25R-Fc fusion protein dose dependently and  IL-25-dependent production of IL-13 by primary mouse non-B,  non-T cells  in an in vitro bioassay. The antibody also inhibited the  interaction between hIL-25 and a soluble hIL-25R-Fc fusion.     The combination of these properties was  investigated further in  in -vivo systems to demonstrate usefulness  in the treatment of asthma.<br>
Example 2: Experimental Model of Allergic Asthma.<br>
BALB/c mice were first sensitized with the antigen ovalbumin (OVA),   before being challenged with aerosolised OVA.     Sensitised and challenged BALB/c mice developed a distinctive asthma phenotype.   This was characterised by increased AHR following exposure to the provocative agent methacholine,  eosinophil infiltration of the airways,   goblet  cell hyperplasia and serum IgE secretion,   as compared to  control  BALB/c mice challenged with PBS   (Fig.   1).<br>
By contrast administration of anti-IL-25 mAb prior to each sensitization and aerosolization with OVA resulted in a marked abrogation in AHR  following challenge with aerosolised methacholine,   with resistance values  comparable to the PBS control mice   (Frg. 1A).     Administration of an isotype-matched control mAb did not suppress  AHR   {Fig.   1A) .<br>
The anti-IL-25 mAb also significantly reduced the	levels of<br>
cellular infiltration around the lung vasculature	(Fig. 1B and<br>
3A), goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways (Fig.	1C and 3B) and<br>
levels of antigen-specific serum IgE (Fig. 1D).<br>
Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) demonstrated that eosinophil infiltration was also significantly suppressed following anti-IL-25 mAb administration as compared to the isotype-control treated mice (Fig. 1E). Since type-2 cytokines are known to regulate these effector functions we determined the levels of cytokines secreted from cells isolated from, the draining mediastinal lymph nodes following antigen restimulation.  In contrast to the elevated levels of type-2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, induced by OVA sensitization and challenge in BALB/c mice, administration of anti-IL-25 mAb resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of these cytokines {Fig. 1F) .<br>
These data support the hypothesis that by' blocking IL-25 signalling we have constrained the production of type-2 cytokines leading to the abrogation of the type-2 effector functions, including inflammation and AHR.  Thus, antagonists of IL-25 effectively suppress type-2 inflammation if administered from the initiation of the response.<br>
Materials  and Methods:<br>
Mice BALB/c mice were obtained from Harlan UK and maintained in the SABU/CBS or National Heart and Lung Institute facilities in specific pathogen free environments. All animal experiments outlined in this report were undertaken with the approval of the UK Home Office.<br>
Sensitization and allergen  exposure<br>
BALB/c mice (6-12 weeks) were sensitised by intraperitoneal administration of ovalbumin (20 ug/injection) complexed with alum, or alum only (controls), at days 0 and 12.  Aerosol administration of 1% ovalbumin was undertaken on days 19, 20, 21 for 20 minutes per day.  On day 22 the animals were analysed using plethysmography to assess AHR.<br><br>
Administration of anti-rmIL-25 monoclonal antibodies<br>
Airways  hyper responsiveness   (AHR)   was  induced as  described and anti-IL-25 mAb   (500 ug/dose)  was administered intraperitoneally the day before  each intraperitoneal OVA sensitisation,   the day before  the  initial  OVA challenge into the  lungs  and 4 hours prior to each OVA aerosolisation.     In further experiments anti-IL-25 mAb   (500  ug/dose)  was administered intraperitoneally only on the day but before each aerosolisation.   Control mice received either  saline or  isotype control   (500  ug/dose)   instead of anti-IL25 mAb.   Isotype  control was anti-c-myc   (mouse  IgGl,   clone 9E10.2).<br>
Measurement  o£ airway responsiveness<br>
Animals were  anaesthetized,   tracheostomised and placed on a ventilator   (SAR-830 series,   CWE Inc)   at  a  rate  of 150 breaths/min,   with a tidal volume of   0.2ml.   Mice were monitored in  a whole body plethysmography   (EMKA Technologies, Paris)   and  transpulmonary pressure was  assessed via an inline transducer.   After recording stable baseline pulmonary resistance,  increasing concentrations of acetyl-ß-methylcholine chloride   (methacholine)   (Sigma,   Dorset,   UK)   were administered by aerosol   for   15  s  at each concentration with an  ultrasonic nebulizer,   and pulmonary resistance was  recorded for a 5 min period.   IOX  software was used to analyse  airways   resistance, compliance  and standard pulmonary parameters.<br>
Bronchoalveolar lavage  (BAL) Mice were  killed by cervical dislocation and  4  x  500ul aliquots of PBS were  injected through the tracheostomy and retrieved. Differential  cell  counts on 150 cells were performed on cytospins   stained with giemsa.<br>
Example 3: Administration Prior to Challenge.<br>
We also assessed whether the anti-IL-25 mAb was effective when administered only prior to the OVA aerosolisation challenge. Treatment with  the anti-IL-25 mAb dramatically reduced the airways  resistance  induced by methacholine  provocation even when it was given  later  in the response   (Fig.   2A) .     By contrast,<br>
administration of the  control  isotype-matched mAb did not abrogate AHR.<br>
Significantly,   analysis  of lung histology sections  showed no significant changes  in  the  levels of cellular infiltrate around blood vessels   (Fig.   2B)   or airway goblet cell hyperplasia   (Fig. 2C) between anti-IL-25 mAb treated mice and the OVA challenged BALB/c controls or  the  isotype-matched mAb treated controls.<br>
Furthermore,   there was  no observable reduction in the proportion of eosinophils  in  the  BAL  fluid   (Fig-.  2D)   or the levels  of antigen-specific serum IgE   (Fig.  2E),   following anti-IL-25 mAb administration.     Strikingly,   the levels of the type-2  cytokines IL-5 and IL-13  remained comparable to those of the OVA challenged BALB/c  controls  or the isotype-matched mAb treated controls following antigen  restimulation  (Fig.   2F) ,   and  IL-13 levels in the BAL were   also unchanged.     Thus,   anti-IL-25 administration during  the  challenge phase of the  response can specifically abrogate AHR even when the type-2  cytokines  and their downstream effectors  are not down-regulated.     These findings suggest  that   IL-25 may initiate AHR by a pathway that is independent of  the  classical type-2  response.<br>
Materials and Methods Materials and methods  were  as described above for  example  2, with the addition  of:<br>
Long tissue collection and histology Lungs were  fixed  in  Formalin   (10% formaldehyde  in  0.9%   saline solution)   for histological  analysis.   Lung sections  were  stained with giemsa for inflammatory infiltrate and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for goblet cells.   PAS-stained goblet cell3 in airway epithelium were measured blind using a numerical  scoring  system (0:   75%) . The sum of airway  scores   from each lung was divided by the number of airways   examined,   25-40 airways/mouse, and  expressed as PAS score  in arbitrary units.   Inflammation was  evaluated using a numerical  scoring system to assess numbers of infiltrating cells  around blood vessels   (0:   layer of infiltrating inflammatory cells  8 cells   thick}. The<br>
sum of airway scores   from each lung was divided by the number of vessels examined,   20-40 airways/mouse, and expressed in arbitrary units.<br>
Example 4:   IL-25 Acts via a type-2-independent pathway<br>
We assessed whether exogenously administered rmIL-25 could elicit enhanced AHR even in the absence of antigen sensitisation or challenge.     As  early as 1-6 hours post intranasal administration of  rmIL-25 to BALB/c mice we detected significantly elevated airways resistance     (Fig.   3A) .     Previous reports have  indicated the central  role played by  IL-13  in the asthma phenotype  and particularly AHR.    To determine  if IL-25 was mediating  its  role  in AHR through IL-13 we administered rmIL-25 to  H13-/- mice.     Once again we observed elevated AHR following rmIL-25   treatment   (Fig.   3B) .     Since  the  other type-2 cytokines have also been shown to contribute  to  the  asthma phenotype we  also assessed the response of il4-/-il5-/-H9-/-ill3-/-to rmIL-25 administered intranasally.     Even in  the absence of all of the  classical  type-2 cytokines  IL-25 treatment enhanced AHR following methacholine provocation   (Fig.   3C) .     These data support a role  for  IL-25 in exacerbating AHR through a type-2 cytokine-independent pathway.<br>
Materials and Methods Materials and methods were as described above   for examples 2 and 3,  with the  addition of:<br>
Mice Transgenic  il4-/-il5-/-il9-/-ill3-/- mice   (P.   G.   Fallon  et al.t 2002.   Immunity 17,   7)   and i113-/- mice   (G.   J.   McKenzie  et  al., 1998.   Curt Biol.   8,   333)   on a BALB/c background were as described.   I125-/- mice on a C57BL/6 x 129 F2  background were as described   (P.   G.   Fallon et al.   2006.   J.  Exp.   Med.   203,   1105).<br>
Intranasal  IL-25 administration<br>
Mice were administered with 1.8 µg of rIL-25   (R&amp;D Systems)   or 1.8  µg of  rIL-13   (Peprotech)   in  40pl  PBS per mouse   intranasally on day 0.     Control animals received PBS only-.<br>
Example 5:   Cloning 2C3 Variable Domains<br>
RNA from three  sub clones of 2c3 was   isolated and cDNA prepared by a reverse transcription reaction.<br>
The immunoglobulin heavy chain   (IgH)   cDNA was amplified by PCR using a  conserved  5'  VH region primer,   MHV7   (SEQ ID NO: 11)   in combination  an  IgGl constant region primer MHCG1   (SEQ ID NO: 12).<br>
Similarly,   immunoglobulin light chain   (IgK)   was amplified using a conserved  5'   IgK region primers MKV9   (SEQ ID NO: 13)   in combination with the kappa constant  region primer MKC  (SEQ ID Np:14).<br>
The thermostable polymerase  Phusion   (NEB   F-531L)   was used throughout   for  PCR reactions.<br>
The 2c3 amplification products of VH7   + MHCGl-primed the PCR reactions   from three independent cDNAs,   were  directly ligated into the pCRII®Blunt-TOPO® vector using  the TOPO-blunt cloning® kit   (Cat  45-0245),   as were the amplification products of the light  chain  amplification reaction.     E.   coli TOP10 bacteria transformed  with the ligated pCRII-blunt vector constructs were cloned on LB-ampicillin-XGal agar plates,   by picking white colonies  onto an agar' grid and into the  PCR screening mixture. The cloned plasmid inserts were PCR-amplified.     The amplification products were gel electrophoresed and the predicted products identified.     Overnight cultures   (5ml)   of each clone,   producing  the correct-sized PCR amplification product, were processed using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit Protocol   (cat 27106),   to produce DHA plasmid minipreps.<br>
Plasmids  were   sequenced using the BigDye® Terminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing  Ready Reaction Kit   (ABI  cat.   4390242).   Each selected plasmid was   sequenced in both directions  using M13  forward and reverse primers  cycled on a GeneAmp9600   PCR machine.  The electrophoretic  sequence  analysis was  done  on an ABI  capillary sequencer.<br>
The complete cycle of RT-PCR,  cloning,   and DNA sequence analysis was  repeated  to obtain three completely independent sets of sequence  information for each immunoglobulin chain.<br>
The complete deduced nucleotide sequence of the VH and Vkappa genes  are  shown as SEQ ID NO: 15 and SEQ  ID NO: 16 respectively. These  sequences include the leader sequences  at the beginning of each variable  gene segment which encodes  a  signal sequence which is used  to transport the newly synthesized antibody chains into the endoplasmic reticulum;  they is  not present in the final heavy and  light chains.<br>
