				<td>INHIBITORS OF a4 MEDIATED CELL ADHESION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising molecules that are inhibitors of α4 mediated (including α4β7) adhesion and which could be useful in treating conditions such as asthma, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases involving leukocyte infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract or other epithelial lined tissues; such as, skin, urinary tract, respiratory airway and joint synovium.<br>
The inhibitors of the present invention could also be useful in treating conditions involving leukocyte infiltration of other tissues including lung, blood vessels, heart and nervous system as well as transplanted organs such as kidney, liver, pancreas and heart. Description of the Related Art<br>
The adhesion of leukocyte to endothelial cells or extracellular matrix proteins is a fundamental process for immunity and inflammation and involves multiple adhesive interactions. The earliest events in this process include leukocyte rolling followed by changes in integrin avidity, which leads to subsequent firm adhesion (for reviews see Butcher, Cell.67:1033-1036 (1991); Harlan, Blood 3:513-525 (1985); Hemler, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 8:365-400 (1990); Osborn, Cell 62:3-6 (1990); Shimizu et al. , Immunol. Rev. 114:109-143 (1990); Springer, Nature 346:425-434 (1990); Springer, Cell 76:301-314 (1994)).  In response to chemotactic factors, the leukocytes must migrate through two adjacent endothelial cells and into tissues that are composed, in part, of the extracellular matrix protein<br>
fibronectin (FN) (see Wayner et al. , J. Cell Biol. 105:1873-1884 (1987)) and collagen (CN) (see Bornstein et al. , Ann. Rev. Biochem. 49:957-1003 (1980) and Miller, Chemistry of the collagens and their distribution. In Connective Tissue Biochemistry. K.A. Piez and A.H. Reddi, editors.  Elsevier, Amsterdam. 41-78. (1983))  Important recognition molecules that participate in these reactions belong to the integrin gene superfamily (for reviews see Hemler, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 8:365-400 (1990); Hynes, Cell 48:549-554 (1987); Shimizu et al. , Immunol. Rev. 114:109-143 (1990); and Springer, Nature 346:425-434 (1990)).<br>
Integrins are composed of non-covalently associated subunits, referred to as the alpha (a) and beta (β) subunits (for reviews see Hemler, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 8:365-400 (1990); Hynes, Cell 48:549-554 (1987); Shimizu et al., Immunol. Rev. 114:109-143 (1990); and Springer, Nature 346:425-434 (1990)).  To date, 8 integrin β subunits have been identified which can associate with 16 distinct a subunits to form 22 distinct integrins.  The  07 integrin subunit, first cloned by Erie et al., (Erle et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266:11009-11016 (1991)) is expressed only on leukocytes and is known to associate with two distinct a subunits, a4 (Ruegg et al., J. Cell Biol. 117:179-189<br>
(1992)) and aE (Cerf-Bensussan et al. , Eur. J. Immunol. 22:273-277 (1992) and Kilshaw et al. , Eur. J. Immunol. 21:2591-2597 (1991)). The αEβ7 heterodimer has E-cadherin as its sole ligand.<br>
The α4β7 complex has three known ligands (VCAM, CS-1, MAdCAM).  One ligand which shows unique specificity for α4β7 is Mucosal Addressing Cell Adhesion Molecule (MAdCAM)<br>
(see Andrew et al., J. Immunol 153:3847-3861 (1994); Briskin et al., Nature 363:461-464 (1993); and Shyjan et al., J. Immunol 156:2851-2857 (1996)).  MAdCAM is highly<br>
expressed on Peyer's patch high endothelial venules, in mesenteric lymph nodes, and on gut lamina propria and mammary gland venules (Berg et al., Immunol. Rev. 105:5 (1989)).  Integrin α4β7 and MAdCAM have been shown to be important in regulating lymphocyte trafficking to normal intestine (Holzmann et al. , Cell 56:37 (1989)).<br>
The second ligand for α4β7 is connecting segment 1 (CS-1), an alternatively spliced region of the FN A chain (see Guan et al., Cell 60:53-61 (1990) and Wayner et al., J. Cell Biol. 109:1321-1330 (1989)).  The cell-binding site within this alternatively spliced region is composed of 25 amino acids where the carboxy terminal amino acid residues, EILDVPST, form the recognition motif (see Komoriya et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266:15075-15079 (1991) and Wayner et al., J. Cell Biol. 116:489-497 (1992)).<br>
The third ligand for α4β7 is vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1), a cytokine inducible protein expressed on endothelial cells (see Elices et al., Cell 60:577-584 (1990) and Ruegg et al., J. Cell Biol. 117:179-189 (1992)). VCAM and CS-1 (see Elices et al., Cell 60:577-584 (1990)) are two 1 igands which are chared by α4β7 and α4βl.  It remains to be unequivocally shown whether MAdCAM, VCAM and CS-1 bind to the same site on α4β7.   Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, Andrew et al. , showed that α4β7 interaction with its three ligands involve distinct but overlapping epitopes (Andrew et al., J. Immunol 153:3847-3861 (1994)). Utility of the Invention<br>
A number of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that<br>
α4 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases.  Monoclonal antibodies directed against α4 have been tested in a variety of disease models.  Efficacy of anti-α4 antibody was demonstrated in a rat and mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (see<br>
Baron et al. , J. Exp. Med. 177:57-68 (1993) and Yednock et al., Nature 356:63-66 (1992)).  A significant number of studies have been done to evaluate the role of α4 in allergic airways (see Abraham et al. , J. Clin. Invest. 93:776-787 (1994); Bochner et al . , J. Exp. Med. 173:1553-1556 (1991); Walsh et al. , J. Immunol 146:3419-3423 (1991); and Weg et al. , J. Exp. Med. 177:561-566 (1993)).  For example, monoclonal antibodies to a4 were effective in several lung antigen challenge models (see Abraham et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:776-787 (1994) and Weg et al., J. Exp. Med. 177:561-566 (1993)).  Interestingly, blockade of cellular recruitment is not seen in certain lung models even though there is abrogation of the late phase response (see Abraham et al. , J. Clin. Invest. 93:776-787 (1994)). The cotton-top tamarin, which experiences spontaneous chronic colitis, showed a significant attenuation of<br>
colitis when anti-a4 antibody was administered (see Bell et al., J. Immunol. 151:4790-4802 (1993) and Podolsky et al., J. Clin. Invest. 92:372-380 (1993)).  Monoclonal antibody to a4 inhibits insulitis and delays the onset of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic mouse (see Baron et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:1700-1708 (1994); Burkly et al., Diabetes 43:529-534 (1994); and Yang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10494-10498 (1993)).  Other diseases where a4 has been implicated include rheumatoid arthritis (see Laffon et al., J. Clin. Invest. 88:546-552 (1991) and Morales-Ducret et al., J. Immunol. 149:1424-1431 (1992)) and atherosclerosis (see Cybulsky et al., Science 251:788-791 (1991)).  Delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (see Issekutz, J. Immunol. 147:4178-4184 (1991)) and contact hypersensitivity response (see Chisholm et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 23:682-688 (1993) and Ferguson et al . , J. Immunol. 150:1172-1182 (1993)) are also blocked by anti-α4 antibodies.  For an excellent review of in vivo studies<br>
implicating α4 in disease (see Lobb  et al. , J. Clin. Invest. 94:1722-1728 (1995)).<br>
Although these studies clearly implicate a4 in a variety of diseases, it is not clear whether the inhibition seen was due to blocking α4βl, α4β7, or both.  Recently, several studies have addressed this issue using an antibody which recognizes the α4β7 complex (see Hesterberg et al. , Gastroenterology (1997)), antibodies against β7 or antibodies directed against MAdCAM (see Picarella et al., J. Immunol. 158:2099-2106 (1997)), for which α4β1 does not bind.  In the primate model of inflammatory bowel disease, it was shown that antibodies to the a407 complex ameliorated inflammation and decreased diarrhea (see Hesterberg et al., Gastroenterology, 111:1373-1380 (1996)). In a second model, monoclonal antibodies to β7 or MAdCAM blocked recruitment of lymphocytes to the colon and reduced the severity of inflammation in the colon of scid mice reconstituted with CD45RBhigh CD4+ cells (see Picarella et al., J. Inununol. 158:2099-2106 (1997)). This, together with<br>
the fact that gut-associated lymphoid tissue is severely<br>
impaired in β7 knock out mice, suggests that α4β7 may be an important intervention point for inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
The expression of α4β7 on a variety of leukocytes and the increase in α4β7 positive cells in diseased tissues implicates that the receptor may play an important role in cellular recruitment to other sites of inflammation in addition to trafficking to the gut. CD4+, CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and eosinophils from human peripheral blood were shown to express high levels of α4β7 (see Picarella et al. , J. Inununol. 158:2099-2106 (1997)). Increased numbers of a407 + T-cells were found in the synovial membrane of rheumatoid arthritis patients and it<br>
was predicted that the augmented expression of α4β7 may contribute to the development and perpetuation of this disease (see Lazarovits et al., J. Immunol. 151:6482-6489<br>
(1993)). In the nonobese diabetic mouse, MAdCAM was expressed on high endothelial venules in inflamed islets within the pancreas suggesting a role for α4β7 in diabetes<br>
(see Kelner et al., Science 266:1395-1399 (1994)).  The distribution of α4β7 on lymphocytes and eosinophils (see Erle et al., J. Immunol. 153:517-528 (1994)), together with in vitro studies showing that a4p7 mediates human eosinophil adhesion to VCAM, CS-1 and MAdCAM (see Walsh et al., (Immunology 89:112-119, 1996), suggests that this integrin may be a target molecule in asthma.  Collectively, these data suggest that integrin α4β7 may play an important role in a variety of inflammatory diseases.<br>
N-terminal domain (domain 1) of MAdCAM has homology to the N-terminal integrin recognition domains in both VCAM and ICAM  (see Briskin et al., Nature 363:461-464 (1993)). Using site-directed mutagenesis on MAdCAM, the binding motif was identified in the first domain as three linear amino acid residues within a C-D loop (see Viney et al . , J. Immunol. 157:2488-2497 (1996)).  Mutations of L40, D41 and T42 resulted in a complete loss of binding activity to α4β7, suggesting that LDT on MAdCAM is involved in binding loop (see Viney et al. , J. Immunol. 157:2488-2497 (1996)). Alignment of this region on MAdCAM with other integrin ligands such as VCAM or CS-1 reveals that there is a conserved binding motif or consensus sequence, consisting of G/Q  I/L E/D T/S and P/S residues (see Briskin et al., J. Immunol. 156:719-726 (1996)).  Further support comes from the fact that linear and cyclic peptides containing LDT  were shown to block cell adhesion to MAdCAM in vitro<br>
(see Shroff et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry<br>
Letters 6:2495-2500 (1996) and Viney et al. , J. Immunol. 157:2488-2497 (1996)).<br>
The use of monoclonal antibodies against integrins in vivo has demonstrated that a number of integrins are indeed valid therapeutic targets for inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases and in organ transplantation.  The objective here was to define an orally bioavailable, non-peptide, small molecule antagonist of α4β7.  Small molecules that are potent inhibitors of a4p7 mediated adhesion to either MAdCAM, VCAM, or CS-1 and which could be useful for the treatment of inflammatory disease are disclosed.

Pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  include  acid-addition salts  with  inorganic  acid  or  organic  acid  (e.g., hydrochloride,     sulfate,     nitrate,     hydrobromide, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate,  acetate), salt with inorganic  base,  organic  base  or  amino  acid  (e.g., triethylamine salt, a salt with lysine, an alkali metal salt, an alkali earth metal, salt and the like).<br>
The active ingredient may be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The composition can be used for treating or preventing α4 (including α4β1 and αβ7 adhesion mediated conditions in a mammal such as a human, especially used for treatment or prevention of a4p7 adhesion mediated conditions. This method may comprise administering to a mammal or a human patient an effective amount of the compound or composition as explained above.<br>
This method can be used to treat or prevent such inflammatory conditions as rheumatoid arthritis,  asthma, psoriasis,  eczema,  contact  dermatitis  and  other  skin inflammatory  diseases,   diabetes,   multiple  sclerosis, systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE),  inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and other diseases involving leukocyte infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract, or other epithelial lined tissues, such as skin, urinary tract, respiratory airway, and joint synovium. The method can be preferably used for treatment<br>
or prevention  of  inflammatory bowel  disease  including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for inhibiting the interaction of a cell bearing a ligand of<br>
MAdCAM-1, including α4β7 integrins, with MAdCAM-1 or a portion thereof (e.g., the extracellular domain), comprising contacting the cell with an active ingredient of the present invention.  In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting the MAdCAM-mediated interaction of a first cell bearing an α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM, for example with a second cell bearing MAdCAM, comprising contacting the first cell with an active ingredient of the present invention.  In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating an individual suffering from a disease associated with leukocyte recruitment to tissues (e.g., endothelium) expressing the molecular MAdCAM-1.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating an individual suffering from a disease associated with leukocyte infiltration of tissues expressing the molecule MAdCAM-1.<br>
According to the present method, the cell bearing the ligand for MAdCAM-1 is contacted with an effective amount of an (i.e., one or more) inhibitor as represented by Structural Formula [I].  As used herein, an inhibitor is a compound which inhibits (reduces or prevents) the binding of MAdCAM-1 to a ligand, including α4β7 integrin, and/or which inhibits the triggering of a cellular response mediated by the ligand.  An effective amount can be an inhibitory amount (such an amount sufficient to achieve inhibition of adhesion of a cell bearing a MAdCAM-1 ligand<br>
to MAdCAM-1).  Ligands for MAdCAM-1 include α4β7 integrins, such as human α4β7 integrin, and its homologs from other<br>
species such as mice (also referred to as α4β7 or LPAM-1 in mice) .<br>
For example, the adhesion of a cell which naturally expresses a ligand for MAdCAM-1, such as a leukocyte (e.g., B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte) or other cells which express a ligand for MAdCAM-1 (e.g., a recombinant cell), to MAdCAM-1 can be inhibited in vitro and/or in vivo according to the present method.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of treating an individual (e.g., a mammal, such as a human or other primate) suffering from a disease associated with leukocyte (e.g., lymphocyte, monocyte) infiltration of tissues (including recruitment and/or accumulation of leukocytes in tissues) which express the molecule MAdCAM-1. The method comprises administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor (i.e., one or more inhibitors) of Structural Formula [I].  For example, inflammatory diseases, including diseases which are associated with leukocyte infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract (including gut-associated endothelium), other mucosal tissues, or tissues expressing the molecular MAdCAM-1 (e.g., gut-associated tissues, such as venules of the lamina propria of the small and large intestine; and mammary gland (e.g., lactating mammary gland)), can be treated according to the present method. Similarly, an individual suffering from a disease associated with leukocyte infiltration of tissues as a result of binding of leukocytes to cells (e.g., endothelial cells) expressing the molecule MAdCAM-1 can be treated according to the present invention.<br>
Diseases which can be treated accordingly include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and pouchitis resulting after proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis after IBD; and other gastrointestinal diseases associated with leukocyte<br>
infiltration, such as Celiac disease, nontropical Sprue, enteropathy associated with seronegative arthropathies, lymphocytic and graft versus host diseases.<br>
Pancreatitis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are other diseases which can be treated using the present method.  It has been reported that MAdCAM-1 is expressed by some vessels in the exocrine pancreas from NOD (nonobese diabetic) mice, as well as from BALB/c and SJL mice. Expression of MAdCAM-1 was reportedly induced on endothelium in inflamed islets of the pancreas of the NOD mouse, and MAdCAM-1 was the predominant address in expressed by NOD islet endothelium at early stages of insulitis  Hanninen, A. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 92: 2509-2515 (1993)).  Further, accumulation of lymphocytes expressing a4p7 within islets was observed, and MAdCAM-1 was implicated in the binding of lymphoma cells via a4p7 to vessels from inflamed islets (Hanninen, A., et al. , J. Clin. Invest., 92: 2509-2515 (1993)).<br>
Examples of inflammatory diseases associated with mucosal tissues which can be treated according to the present method include mastitis (mammary gland), cholecystitis, cholangitis or pericholangitis (bile duct and surrounding tissue of the liver), chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, asthma, and graft versus host disease (e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract).  Chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung which result in interstitial fibrosis, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, collagen disease (in SLE and RA), sarcoidosis, and other idiopathic conditions can be amenable to treatment.<br>
Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which<br>
recognizes the α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) , has been reported to play a role in in vivo leukocyte recruitment (Silber et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:1554-1563 (1994)).  However, these therapeutic targets are likely to be involved in<br>
inflammatory processes in multiple organs, and a functional blockade could cause systemic immune  dysfunction.  In contrast to VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and mucosal tissues, binds the α4β7 integrin found on lymphocytes, and participates in the homing of these cells to mucosal sites, such as Peyer's patches in the intestinal wall (Hamann et al., J. Immunol., 152:3282-3293 (1994)).  As inhibitors of the binding of MAdCAM-1 to a4|37 integrin, the active ingredients of the present invention have the potential for fewer side effects due to, for example, effects on other tissue types where adhesion is mediated by other receptors, such as a4(5l integrin.<br>
Undesired symptoms of the condition listed herein can alleviated using the present method.  The symptoms may be caused by inappropriate cell adhesion and/or cell activation to release proinflammatory mediators mediated by 0.407 integrins.  Such inappropriate cell adhesion or signal transduction would typically be expected to occur as a result of increased VCAM and/or MAdCAM expression on the surface of endothelial cells.  Increased VCAM, MAdCAM and/or CS-1 expression can be due to a normal inflammatory response or due to abnormal inflammatory states.<br>
The present method can be used to assess the inhibitory effect of a compound of the present invention and of other potential antagonists useful in the method on the interaction of MAdCAM-1 with a ligand for MAdCAM-1 in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Compounds suitable for use in therapy can also be evaluated in vivo, using suitable animal models.  Suitable animal models of inflammation have been described.  For example, NOD mice provide animal model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  CD45 RBHi SCID model provide a model in mice with similarity to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Powrie, F. et al., Immunity, 1: 553-562 (1994)).<br>
Captive cotton-top tamarins, a New World nonhuman primate species, develop spontaneous, often chronic, colitis that clinically and histolgocially resembles ulcerative colitis in humans (Madara, J.L. et al., Gastroenterology, 88: 13-19 (1985)).  The tamarin model and other animal models of gastrointestinal inflammation using BALB/c mice (a (DSS)-induced inflammation model; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate). IL-10 knockout mice which develop intestinal lesions similar to those of human inriammatory bowel disease have also been described (Strober, W. and Ehrhardt, R.O., Cell, 75: 203-205 (1993)).<br>
According to the method, an inhibitor can be administered to an individual (e.g., a human) alone or in conjunction with another agent, such as an additional pharmacologically active agent (e.g., sulfasalazine, an antiinflammatory compound, or a steroidal or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory compound).  A compound can be administered before, along with or subsequent to administration of the additional agent, in amounts sufficient to reduce or prevent MAdCAM-mediated binding to a ligand for MAdCAM-1, such as human α4β7.<br>
An effective amount of the active ingredient can be administered by an appropriate route in a single dose or multiple doses.  An effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect (such as an amount sufficient to reduce or prevent MAdCAM-mediated binding to a MAdCAM ligand, thereby inhibiting leukocyte adhesion and infiltration and associated cellular responses.  Suitable dosages of active ingredient of the present invention for use in therapy, diagnosis or prophylaxis, can be determined by methods known in the art and can be dependent, for example, upon the individual's age, sensitivity, tolerance and overall well-being.<br>
The active ingredient of the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered either orally or parenterally, and it may be used as a suitable pharmaceutical preparation, for example, a tablet, a granule, a capsule, a powder, an injection, and an inhalation by a conventional process.<br>
The dose of the active ingredient of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof varies depending on an administration method, age, body weight, and state of a patient, but, in general, the daily dose is preferably about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day, particularly preferably 1 to 100 mg/kg/day. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
As indicated previously, the active ingredient of formula [I] can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions.  In determining when a compound of formula [I] is indicated for the treatment of a given disease, the particular disease in question, its severity, as well as the age, sex, weight, and condition of the subject to be treated, must be taken into consideration and this perusal is to be determined by the skill of the attendant physician. For medical use, the amount of a compound of Formula<br>
[I] required to achieve a therapeutic effect will, of course, vary both with the particular compound, the route of administration, the patient under treatment, and the particular disorder or disease being treated.  A suitable daily dose of a compound of Formula [I], or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for a mammalian subject suffering from, or likely to suffer from, any condition as described herein before is 0.1 mg to 100 mg of the compound of formula [I], per kilogram body weight of the<br>
(systemic) mammalian subject. In the case of systemic administration, the dose may be in the range of 0.5 to 100 mg of the compound per kilogram body weight, the most preferred dosage being 0.5 to 50 mg/kg of mammal body weight<br>
administered two to three times daily.  In the case of topical administration, e.g., to the skin or eye, a suitable dose may be in the range of 0.1 µg to 100 µg of the compound per kilogram, typically about 0.1 µg/kg.<br>
In the case of oral dosing, a suitable dose of a compound of Formula [I], or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, may be as specified in the preceding paragraph, but preferably is from 1 mg to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram, the most preferred dosage being from 5 mg to 25 mg/kg of mammal body weight, for example, from 1 to 10 mg/kg.  Most preferably, a unit dosage of an orally administrable composition encompassed by the present invention contains less than about 1.0 g of a formula [I] compound.<br>
It is understood that the ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian will readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of a compound of Formula [I] to prevent or arrest the progress of the condition for which treatment is administered.  In so proceeding, the physician or veterinarian could employ relatively low doses at first, subsequently increasing the dose until a  maximum response is obtained.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the present invention can be administered to patients sufferina from a condition listed herein in an amount which is effective to fully or partially alleviate undesired symptoms of the condition. The symptoms may be caused by inappropriate cell adhesion or cell activation to release proinflammatory mediators mediated by α4β7 integrins.  Such inappropriate cell adhesion or signal transduction would typically be expected to occur as a result of increased VCAM-1 and/or MAdCAM expression on the surface of endothelial cells.  Increased VCAM-1, MAdCAM and/or CS-1 expression can be due to a normal inflammation response or due to abnormal inflammatory states.  In either case, an effective dose of a compound of<br>
the invention may reduce the increased cell adhesion due to increased VCAM-1 and/or MAdCAM expression by endothelial cells.  Reducing the adhesion observed in the disease state by 50% can be considered an effective reduction in adhesion. More preferably, a reduction in ex vivo adhesion by 90%, is achieved.  Most preferably, adhesion mediated by VCAM-1, MAdCAM and/or CS-1 interaction is abolished by an effective dose.  Clinically, in some instances, effect of the compound can be observed as a decrease in white cell infiltration into tissues or a site of injury.  To achieve a therapeutic effectiveness, then, the compounds or compositions of the present invention are administered to provide a dose effective to reduce or eliminate inappropriate cell adhesion or inappropriate cell activation to alleviate undesired symptoms.<br>
While it is possible for an active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula [I] and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier thereof.  Such formulations constitute a further feature of the present invention.<br>
The formulations, both for human and veterinary medical use, of the present invention comprise an active ingredient of Formula [I], in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier thereof and optionally other therapeutic ingredient(s), which are generally known to be effective in treating the disease or condition encountered.  The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulations and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The formulations include those in a form suitable for oral, pulmonary, ophthalmic, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), intra-particular, topical, nasal inhalation (e.g., with an aerosol) or buccal administration.  Such formulation are understood to include long-acting formulations known in the art.  Oral and parenteral administration are preferred modes of administration.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.  All methods may include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.  In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired form.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets, or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient in the form of a powder or granules; in the form of a solution or suspension in an aqueous liquid.  Formulations for other uses could involve a nonaqueous liquid; in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion; in the form of an aerosol; or in the form of a cream or ointment or impregnated into a transdermal patch for use in administering the active ingredient transdermally, to a patient in need thereof.  The active ingredient of the present inventive compositions may also be administered to a patient in need thereof in the form of a bolus, electuary, or paste.<br>

RPMI-CS-1 Cell Adhesion Assay:<br>
The following assay established the activity of the present compounds in inhibiting β7-mediated cell adhesion in a representative in vitro system. This assay measures the adhesive interactions of a B-cell line, RPMI, known to express α4(37 (Erle et al. , J. Immunol. 153: 517-528 (1994)), to the alternatively spliced region of fibronectin referred to as CS-1, in the presence of test compounds. The test compounds were added in increasing concentrations to RPMI cells and then the cell-compound mixture was added to CS-1 coated microwells. The plates were incubated, washed and the percentage of attached cells were quantitated. The present assay directly demonstrates the cell adhesion inhibitory activity and adhesion modulatory activity of the present compounds.<br>
RPMI-CS-1 assay<br>
The CS-1 derived peptide, CLHPGEILDVPST, and the scrambled control peptide, CLHGPIELVSDPT, were synthesized at Tanabe Research Laboratories, USA, Inc. on a Beckman 990 synthesizer using t-Boc methodology. The peptides were immobilized onto microtiter plates using the heterobifunctional crosslinker 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDP) as reported<br>
(Pierschbacher, et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 1224-1227 (1983)). Microtiter plates were coated with 20 µg/ml human serum albumin (HSA) for 2 hours at room temperature, washed once with,PBS and derivatized with 10 µg/ml SPDP for 1 hour. After washing, 100 µl of a 100 µg/ml cysteine containing peptide solution which had been recently dissolved was added to the wells and allowed to crosslink to the plates overnight at 4 °C. Unbound peptide was removed from the plates by washing with PBS. To block non-reacted sites, the plates were coated with 100 µl of a 2.5 mg/ml BSA solution in PBS for one hour at 37° C. 100 µl of RPMI cells (2.5 x 106 cells/ml) in Dulbecco' s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) plus 0.25 % ovalbumin were added to peptide coated dishes and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. Following this incubation, the plates were washed with PBS three times using an EL404 plate washer and the number of adherent cells was quantitated by measuring enzymatic activity of endogenous N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (Landegren, J. Immunol. Methods, 67: 379-388 (1984)). To do this, the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-p-D-glucoseaminide is dissolved at 7.5 mM in 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 5 and then mixed with an equal volume of 0.5% Triton X100. 50 µl of the substrate solution was added to the plates and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 µl 50 mM glycine, 5 mM EDTA buffer pH 10.4. The amount of liberated p-nitrophenol was quantitated by reading the optical density at 405 nm using a vertical pathway spectrophotometer to quantitate attachment (VMAX Kinetic Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). This procedure is a modification of a previously published method (Cardarelli et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 18668-18673 (1994)) .<br>
