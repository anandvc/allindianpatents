This invention relates to a mounting arrangement of torque link for the rear swing-ami type two-wheelers.<br>
1	2<br>
Two-wheeters, which have rear swipg-arm<for the rear cushion></for>
brake panel) a torque link/and the reir swing-arm to which said brake panel<br>
is angularly secured against rotation from each other through said torque<br>
link in any normal conventional dium brake system. As the brake panel<br>
carries the brake shoes, which normally develop brake torque on brake<br>
drum, which is an integral part of wheel, the reactive brake torque or the<br>
wheel torque by the road friction ap well as from the wheel inertia during<br>
deceleration acts on the brake panel through the brake shoes resulting in a<br>
tendency of rotation of brake panel along with wheel. To prevent this<br>
tendency and balance this torque, tie torque link,*which is provided for<br>
connecting between the brake panel^and swing arm develops the axial<br>
tensile force, which counteracts tf(e force that is developed from this<br>
torque.<br>
In the mounting arrangement of torque link in any conventional system? the torque link is secured through a detachable attachment through normal fasteners. One end of torque link is fastened to a.bracket^which is rigidly attached to the rear swing-arm. Its other end is also fastened to the brake panelfso as to enable the torque-link force in its axial direction being tangential to the brake panelat its connecting point^This attachment on the swing-arm side is either by securing both torque-link endjand this bracket 5 together through bolt and nut oif securing torque UnjLwith this bracket^ through a stud^which is integrally cjonnected (welded) to this bracket and further secured by a nut for clamping this torque-link, ^<br>
The present problems are^ investigated in this conventional mounting arrangement of torque-linkpith swing-arm part as follows: There is more noise like metal-to-metal hitting in the links connected between the brake pane and swing-arm through torque-link only during, panic or sudden braking. This problem exists at every panic or sudden braking, which follows only after previous braking end up at static conditions.<br>
In more detail, if any sudden braking is applied after its previous brake application that is continued up to its stand still condition of vehicle as in normal case, then this kind of metal-to-metal hitting noise comes. This is<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The location of the recess in both torque-link and its connected part is characterized such that the normal clamping force by means of the fasteners, enables to firmly secure these recess with each other in lateral and axial directions.<br>
The recess both torque-link add its connected partes concentric to its fastener.such that the maximum clamping force from the means of fasteners can be utihzed for securing these recess in both torque-link^and its connected parj^without any lateral and axial movements under the operating load conditions and alsc it enables the possibility for any re¬alignment of torque-link with respect to swing-armkangularly about its fastenersmounting axis during asjselmbly.<br>
The recess mounting is provided with resilient mounting fasteners so as to provide the enough axial clampihd force without damaging the fasteners \bb AUfl-and such that this fastener is firmly (secured under any vibration loads.<br>
According to this invention, during normal clamping by means of fasteners iD&amp;Mcft the recesses^are self-located ancjl interlocked by securing in an inclined • -direction that is resultant of axial and lateral directions such that any inherent lateral clearanceTmevitabW allowed between the fastener and hole of torque-link,Aor its connected part or both only during assembly and dismantling is deactivated for the possibility of any clearance in lateral and axial directions between them by the abutment of these recess.<br>
So any tendency of lateral mojvebent between the torque-link with its connected part is substantially arrested by this interlocking by means of self-locking of these recess. Under any operating conditions of sudden or panic braking, this recess mounting arrangement will not allow any hitting noise in these joints and subsequently the lateral clearance between the fasteners and torque-link mounting end.<br>
As the possibilities of shock load transfer under panic*or sudden braking are prevented, then the lateral clearance^between the fasteners and torque-link^end is not aggravated unlike in conventional arrangement thus eliminating the cause of brake panel breakage failures over the period of * usage with fatigue load-cycles.<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment the connected part 205 is rigidly connected (welded) 210A with a recess shaped 21 OB or conical shaped cup washer 210 and a stud 206 in a concentric axis. It enhances ease of assembly and reliability. Thus it ensures the<br>
concentricity of recess seating and fasteners<br>
i<br>
resulting in better reliahilitv of its fiinrrinn<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1 A mounting arrangement of torque link for the rear swing arm type two wheelers comprising at least one recess provided on the torque link mounting surface; at least one other recess also provided  on the mounting surface of its connected part; a detachable fastening arrangement provided near recess, (me first recess and the second recess abutting against bach other so as to facilitate assembly and disassembly whereby the said mounting arrangement causes the recesses to interlock with each other 'by the clamping fcirce of the detachable fasteners so as to eliminate any lateral clearance us well as x axial clearance for eiimh&amp;ating any hitting action or its tendency with noise.<br>
2. A mounting arrangement of tor due link for the rear swing arm type two wheelers substantially as herein described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
