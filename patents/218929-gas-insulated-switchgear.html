BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the gas-Insulated switchgear comprises a first module 2b and a second module 4b, the respective tanks 5b and 5c thereof having identical outer diameter dimension and configuration. In the illustrated example, each of the tanks 5b and 5c are of a substantially square configuration having substantially equal depth, width and height dimensions, but may equally be of a rectangular prallelopiped configuration.<br>
The first module tank 5b has at its front face an opening portion to which a mounting plate 16a is hermetically attached. Attached to the rear face of the mounting plate 16a are an electrically insulating cylinders 17 in which interrupters 6 are accommodated and grounding switches 7b, and operating rods 18 for driving the interrupters 6 and the grounding switches 7b extending through a hole formed in the mounting plate 16a are connected to operating units 15 attached to the front face of the mounting plate 16a. Pickings 19 maintains the hermetic seal between the operating rods 18 and the mounting plate 16a even when the operating rods are actuated. Cable connecting bushings 8b are mounted to the tank rear face for the connection of power cables 20 and a gas section spacer 3b is hermetically attached to the tank top face. The main circuit components are connected by connecting conductors 21 and 22, and the disconnector portion that is removed from the basic structure is also connected by short-circuiting conductors 23. The opening portions for the bus bars that are removed from the basic structure are used during assembly within the tank and closed by covers after the completion of the assembly<br>
The second module tank 5c has, similarly to the first module tank 5b, at its front face an opening portion to which a mounting plate 16b is hermetically attached. Attached to the rear face of the mounting plate 16b are an electrically insulating cylinder 17 in which an interrupter is accommodated and a<br><br>
disconnector 10b with a grounding switch. A bus bar bushings 24 are mounted to the tank rear face for the connection of bus bars 25 and a gas section spacer 3b is hermetically attached to the tank bottom face. The main circuit components are connected by connecting conductors 26, and the interrupter portion that is removed from the basic structure is also connected by short-circuiting conductors 27. The opening portions for the cable connecting bushings that are removed from the basic structure are used during assembly within the tank and closed by a cover after the completion of the assembly (not shown).<br>
Figs. 2 to 5 illustrate the basic structure of the module for a gas-insulated switchgear. As shown in these figures, an opening portion is provided at the front face of the module tank 5d, and the opening portion has hermetically attached thereto a mounting plate 16c. Attached to the mounting plate 16c is an insulating cylinder 17 below which the disconnector 10b with a grounding switch is disposed, and at the tank rear face the bus bar bushings 24 are disposed in a positional relationship in which the first and the third phases are vertically and horizontally displaced relative to the second phase. Bellow the bus bar bushings 24, the cable connecting bushings 8b are horizontally disposed. On the other hand, on the top and the bottom face of the tank, the gas section spacers 3b are mounted. In the actual circuit configuration, there is no such a case in which all of the bus bar bushings 24, the cable connecting bushings 8b and upper and lower gas section spacers 3b are necessary, and unnecessary equipments are removed and in the actual application the mounting openings for the removed equipments are utilized as the opening portions for the tank inside works and a cover plate can be hermetically attached after the work. Also, the switchgear module may equally be used by positioning upside down, with the disconnections 10b with the grounding switches disposed above the insulating cylinders and the cable connecting bushings 8b disposed above the bus bar bushings 24 in inverted positions. Also, as illustrated in Fig. 3, this basic configuration may also used in the case where a single switchgear module is used when the gas section spacer 3b is removed and the opening portions are closed by the a closure member (not shown).<br><br>
Embodiment 2<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, similarly to the first embodiment, the first module 2b and the second module 4b (the equipments within the tank is changed to a disconnector with a grounding switch instead of a grounding switch) are provided and a third module 28 is mounted under the first module 2b via the gas section spacer 3b. The third module tank 28 similar to other tanks has at the front face of the tank an opening portion, to which a mounting plate 16d is hermetically attached. At the rear face of the mounting plate 16d, insulating cylinders 17 and grounding switches 7b disposed under the insulating cylinders 17 are mounted. The gas section spacers 3b are electrically connected to lightning arresters 29 and the grounding switches 7b by connecting conductors 30.<br>
