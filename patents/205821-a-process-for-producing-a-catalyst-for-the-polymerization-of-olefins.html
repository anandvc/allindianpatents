				<td>The present invention concerns a process for producing a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
The present application is divided from Indian Patent Application No.   186169 (316/Cal/96)  dated 20th February 1996,<br>
Indian Patent No.   173341  describes solid catalyst components comprising as an internal electron-donor,   an ether containing two or more ether groups,  and having specific reaction characteristics toward the anhydrous magnesium chloride and TiCl4.<br>
The catalysts obtained from the reaction of said catalyst components with an Al-alkyl compound exhibit high activity and stereospecificity in the polymerization of olefins, and do not require the use of an external electron-donor.<br>
It has now been found that by reacting an Al-alkyl compound with a solid catalyst component comprising magnesium dihalide in active form,  a titanium compound and a 1,3-diether in which the carbon atom in position 2 belongs to a specific cyclic structure containing two or three unsaturations (cyclopolyenic structure), a catalyst is obtained which has uncommonly high catalytic activity and a high level of stereospecificity in the polymerization of olefins.<br>
In fact,  the above mentioned 1,3-diethers with a cyclopolyenic structure  (hereinafter cyclopolyenic 1,3-diethers), which are not disclosed in Indian Patent No.   173341,   confer to the abovementioned catalyst an activity considerably higher than the  one obtained by using<br>
-    2    -<br><br>
the ethers known in the art.<br>
The addition of an external electron-donor to the above catalyst, containing the cyclopolyenic 1,3-diether as internal electron-donor, allows one to obtain very high levels of stereospecificity while maintaining high activity. Thus one obtains balances of activity and stereospecificity that cannot be reached with the ethers known in the art.<br>
Indian Patent No. 173047 describes	-<br>
catalysts comprising the reaction product of a solid catalyst component comprising a titanium compound and an internal electron-donor supported on a magnesium dihalide in active form, an Al-alkyl compound, and, as an external electron-donor, an ether containing two or more ether groups and capable of forming complexes with anhydrous magnesium chloride, under standard conditions, in quantities lower than 60 mmoles per 100 g of magnesium chloride.<br>
Said catalysts exhibit high activity and stereospecif icity in the polymerization of olefins.<br>
It has now been found that the performance of the above mentioned catalysts is improved when the previously said cyclopolyenic 1,3-diethers are used as the external electron-donors .<br>
In fact, the catalysts obtained by using, as the external-electron donors,  the above mentioned cyclopolyenic  1,3-<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
diethers, which are not disclosed in Indian Patent No. 173047, display, in the polymerization of<br>
olefins, very high balances of activity and stereospecificit not obtainable with the ethers known in the art.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a soli catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins, sai solid catalyst component comprising a magnesium halide i active form, and, supported thereon, a titanium compoun containing at least one Ti-halogen bond and, as the interna electron-donor compound, a cyclopolyenic 1,3-diether in which the carbon atom in position 2 belongs to a cyclic or polycycli structure made up of 5, 6, or 7 carbon atoms, or of 5-n or 6-n carbon atoms, and respectively n nitrogen atoms and n heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of N, O, S am Si, where n is 1 or 2 and n' is 1, 2, or 3, said structun containing two or three unsaturations (cyclopolyeni structure), and optionally being condensed with other cycli' structures, or substituted with one or more substituent selected from the group consisting of linear or branched alky radicals; cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl radicals an halogens, or being condensed with other cyclic structures an substituted with one or more of the above mentione substituents that can also be bonded to the condensed cycli structures;   one or more of the above mentioned alkyl<br>

The cyclopolyenic 1,3-diethers according to the present invention  can  be  prepared  by  first  synthesizing  the cyclopolyendimethylol by way of reaction of the desired cyclopolyene with paraformaldehyde in the presence of sodium alcoholate (as described by B. WESSLEN, ACTA CHEM.SCAND.21 (1967)718-20), and then transforming the dimethylol derivative into  the  corresponding  diether  by  way  of  alkylation, cycloalkylation, or arylation, according to known techniques, such as by reaction of the dimethylol derivative with an alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl halide in the presence of a strong base, such as NaH, in proper solvent, such as tetrahydrofurane.<br>
The electron-donor compound present in the solid catalyst component a1) can be a Lewis base containing one or more electronegative groups where the electron-donor atoms are selected from the group consisting of N, 0, S, P, As or Sn. Examples of the above mentioned electron-donor compounds are<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
widely described in the art. Preferred are the electron-donor compounds that can be extracted with Al-triethyl from the catalyst component a1) for at least 70% in moles, the surface area (B.E.T.) of the solid product of extraction being at least 20 m2/g, and generally ranging from 100 to 300 m2/g.<br>
Examples of the above mentioned electron-donor compounds are described in Indian Patent No.161721 and comprise ethers, ketones. lactones,  compounds containing N,  P, and/or S atoms, and specific types of esters.<br>
In addition to the esters of Indian Patent No.161721, the esters described in Indian Patent No.154219 can be used.<br>
Particularly suited are the phthalic acid esters such as diisobutyl, dioctyl and diphenyl phthalate, benzyl-butyl phthalate; the malonic acid esters such as diisobutyl and diethyl malonate; the alkyl and aryl pivalates; the alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aryl maleates; the alkyl and aryl carbonates such as diisobutyl carbonate, ethyl-phenyl carbonate and diphenyl carbonate; the succinic acid esters such as mono and diethyl succinate. Preferred are the phthalic acid esters.<br>
Also useful  in the catalyst component  a1)  are the electron-donor compounds described In Indian Patent No.173341.<br>
Said compounds are ethers that contain two or more ether groups, and that, under standard conditions, are capable of<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
forming complexes with anhydrous magnesium chloride for less that 60 mmoles per 100 g of chloride and with TiCl, they do not undergo substitution reactions, or they only do so for less than 5 0% in moles.<br>
The tests that allow the verification of the above reactivity criteria are reported below. Complexing test of the ethers with MgCl2<br>
In a 100 ml glass flask with fixed blades mechanical stirrer are introduced under nitrogen atmosphere in order:<br>
70 ml of anhydrous n-heptane<br>
12 mmoles of anhydrous MgCl2 activated as described below<br>
2 mmoles of ether.<br>
The content is allowed to react at 60°C for 4 hours (stirring speed at 400 rpm) . It is then filtered and washed at ambient temperature with 100 ml of n-heptane after which it<br>
in dried with a mechanical pump.<br>
The solid is characterized, after having been treated with 100 ml of ethanol, by way of a gaschromatographic quantitative analysis for the analysis of the quantity of ether fixed. Test of the reaction with TiCl4<br>
In a 25 ml test-tube with a magnetic stirrer and under nitrogen atmosphere are introduced:<br>
10 ml of anhydrous n-heptane,<br>
5 mmoles of TiCl4 ,<br>
-15-<br><br>
1 mmole of donor<br>
The content is allowed to react at 70°C for 30 minutes, after which it is cooled to 25°C and decomposed with 90 ml of ethanol.<br>
The solutions obtained are analyzed by way of gaschromatography using the internal standard method, with an HRGC 5300 Mega Series Carlo Erba gaschromatograph with a 25 meters chrompack CP-SIL 5 CB capillary column.<br>
The magnesium chloride used in the complexing test with the ethers is prepared as follows.<br>
In a 1 liter vibrating mill jar (Vibratom from Siebtechnik) containing 1.8 Kg of steel spheres 16 mm in diameter, are introduced under nitrogen atmosphere 5 0 g of anhydrous MgCl2 and 6.8 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE).<br>
The content is milled at room temperature for 96 hours, after which the solid recovered is kept under vacuum in the mechanical pump for 16 hours at 50°C. Characterization of the solid:<br>
half-peak breadth of the reflection DUO = 1.15 cm. Presence of a halo with maximum intensity at 26 = 32.1° Surface area (B.E.T.) = 125 m2/g residual DCE = 2.5% by weight. Examples of ethers having the features indicated above are<br>

The preparation of the solid catalyst components a) and a1) can be carried out using various methods.<br>
For example, the magnesium halide (used anhydrous, containing less than 1% of water), the titanium compound, and the electron-donor compound are milled together under conditions that cause the activation of the magnesium halide,-the milled product is then caused to react one or more times with TiCl4 in excess, optionally in the presence of an electron-donor, at a temperature ranging from 80 to 135°C, and then repeatedly washed with a hydrocarbon (such as hexane, for example) until no chlorine ions can be detected in the wash liquid.<br>
According to another method the anhydrous magnesium halide is preactivated according to known methods and then reacted with an excess of TiCl4 containing the electron-donor compound and optionally an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent (for example: hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene,<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
dichloroethane). In this case also the operation takes place at a temperature between 80° and 135°C. The reaction with TiCl4, in the presence or absence of an electron-donor, is optionally repeated and the solid is then washed with hexane to eliminate the nonreacted TiCl4.<br>
According to another method, a MgCl2.nROH adduct {particularly in the form of spheroidal particles) where n is generally from 1 to 3, and ROH is an alcohol, such as ethanol, butanol, isobutanol for example, is caused to react with an excess of TiCl4 containing the electron-donor compound and optionally one of the above mentioned hydrocarbon solvents. The reaction temperature initially is from 0 to 25°C, and is then increased to 80-13 5°C. After reaction, the solid is reacted once more with TiCl4, in the presence or absence of the electron-donor, then separated and washed with a hydrocarbon until no chlorine ions can be detected in the wash liquid.<br>
According to yet another method, magnesium alcoholates and chloroalcoholates  (the  chloroalcoholates  can be prepared<br>
particularly as described in Indian Patent No.149940 are caused to<br>
react with TiCl4 in excess containing the electron-donor compound, operating under the reaction conditions already described.<br>
According to another method,  complexes of magnesium halides with titanium alcoholates {the MgCl2. 2Ti (OC4H9) 4 complex<br>
-20 -<br><br>
is a typical example) are caused to react, in a hydrocarbon solution, with TiCl4 in excess containing the electron-donor compound; the separated solid product is reacted again with an excess of TiCl4, in the presence or absence of electron-donor, and then separated and washed with hexane. The reaction with TiCl4 is carried out at a temperature ranging from 80° to 130°C.<br>
According to a variance,, the MgCl2 and titanium alcoholate complex is caused to react in a hydrocarbon solution with polyhydrosiloxane; the separated solid product is reacted at 50°C with silicon tetrachloride containing the electron-donor compound; the solid is then reacted with TiCl4 in excess, in the presence or absence of electron-donor, operating at 80°-130°C.<br>
Independently from the specific preparation method, after the last reaction with TiCl4 in the presence of the electron-donor, it is preferable to separate the solid obtained (by way of filtration, for example) , and cause it to react with an excess of TiCl4 at temperatures ranging from 80 to 135°C, before washing it with the hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
Finally, it is possible to cause to react TiCl4 in excess and containing the electron-donor with porous resins such as partially cross-linked styrene-divinylbenzene in spherical particle form, or porous inorganic oxides such as silica and alumina, impregnated with solutions of magnesium compounds or<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
complexes soluble in organic solvents.<br>
The porous resins which can be used are described in the abandoned Indian Patent Application No. 416/Cal/89.<br>
The reaction with TiCl4 is carried out at 80-100°C. After separating the excess TiCl4, the reaction is repeated and the solid is then washed with a hydrocarbon.<br>
The MgCl3/electron-donor molar ratio used in the reactions indicated above generally ranges from 4:1 to 12:1.<br>
The electron-donor compound is fixed on the magnesium halide in a quantity generally ranging from 1 to 20% molar.<br>
In particular, the cyclopolyenic 1,3-diether is fixed on the magnesium halide in a quantity generally ranging from 5 to 20% molar.<br>
In the solid catalyst components a) and a1) the Mg/Ti ratio is generally from 30:1 to 4:1; in the components supported on resins or on inorganic oxides the ratio can be different and usually ranges from 20:1 to 2:1.<br>
The titanium compounds that can be used for the preparation of catalyst components a) and a1) are the halides and halogen alcoholates. The titanium tetrachloride is the preferred compound. Satisfactory results can also be obtained with the trihalides, particularly TiCl3 HR, TiCl3 ARA, and with the halogen alcoholates such as TiCl3 OR, where R is a phenyl radical, for example.<br>
- 22. -<br><br>
The above reactions cause the formation of magnesium halide in active form. In addition to these reactions, other reactions are known in the literature that bring to the formation of magnesium halide in active form starting from magnesium compounds different from the halides.<br>
The active form of the magnesium halides present in the catalyst components of the invention is recognizable by the fact that in the X-rays spectrum of the catalyst component the major intensity reflection which appears in the spectrum of the nonactivated magnesium halides (having surface area smaller than 3 m2/g) is no longer present, but in its place there is a halo with the position of the maximum intensity shifted with respect to the position of the major intensity reflection, or by the fact that the major intensity reflection presents a half-peak breadth at least 30% greater that the one of the corresponding reflection of the nonactivated Mg halide. The most active forms are those in which the halo appears in the X-ray spectrum of the solid catalyst component;<br>
Among the magnesium halides, the chloride is the preferred compound. In the case of the most active forms of the magnesium chloride, the halo appears in place of the reflection which in the spectrum of the nonactivated magnesium chloride is situated at the interplanar distance of 2.56 A.<br>
The catalyst components a) and a1) form, by reaction with<br>
- 23 -<br><br>
the Al-alkyl compounds, catalysts which can be used in the polymerization of CH2 = CHR olefins, where R is hydrogen or a 1-6 carbon alkyl radical, or an aryl radical, or mixtures of said olefins or of said olefins and diolefins.<br>
However the present invention requires the use of an external electron-donor with the catalyst component a1}, at least when the latter is different from the catalyst component a) .<br>
The Al-alkyl compounds comprise Al-trialkyls such as Al-triethyl, Al-triisobutyl, Al-tri-n-butyl, Al-trioctyl. One can also use linear or cyclic Al-alkyl compounds containing one or more Al atoms bonded to one another with 0, N, or S atoms.<br>
Examples of said compounds are:<br><br>
where n is a number from 1 to 20; A1R2OR' compounds where R' is a C6-C20 aryl radical substituted at position 2 and/or 6, and<br>

The trialkyl compounds can also be used in blends with Al-alkyl halides such as AlEt2Cl and AlEt3/2Cl3/2.<br>
The polymerization of the olef ins is carried out according to known methods operating in liquid phase constituted by one or more monomers, or by a solution of one or more monomers in an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, or in gas phase, or also by combining polymerization stages in liquid phase and in gas phase.<br>
The (co)polymerization temperature is usually from 0° to 150°C; particularly from 60° to 100°C. The operation occurs at atmospheric pressure or higher.<br>
The catalysts can be precontacted with small quantities of olefins (prepolymerization) . The prepolymerization improves the performance of the catalysts as well as the morphology of<br>
the polymers.<br>
The prepolymerization is carried out maintaining the catalysts in suspension in a hydrocarbon solvent {hexane or heptane, for example), adding an olefin, and operating at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 60°C producing a quantity of polymer generally from 0.5 to 3 times the weight of the catalyst.  It can also be carried out in liquid monomer,<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
under the temperature conditions indicated above, and producing quantities of polymer which can reach 1000 g per g of catalytic component.<br>

The catalysts find particular application in the polymerization of CH2=CHR olefins where R is a 1-6 carbon alkyl or aryl radical. In particular, said catalysts are adequate for the polymerization of propylene or its copolymerization with ethylene or other  -olefins.<br>
Carrying out the polymerization in liquid monomer operating with Al/Ti ratios lower than 50, it is possible to obtain, thanks to the high productivity of the catalysts of the present invention, hyperpure homopolymers and copolymers of propylene useful in the electronic field (capacitor grade).<br>
