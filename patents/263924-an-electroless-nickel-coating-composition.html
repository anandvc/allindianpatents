				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to an electroless nickel coating composition for<br>
coating re-enforcement bars. In particular, the invention relates to an electroless<br>
nickel coating of thermo-mechanical treated (TMT) re-bar, without removing the<br>
oxide scale. The invention provides a nickel-phosphorus alloy coating<br>
composition and a method of depositing a nickel-phosphorus alloy coating by<br>
electroless process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The formation and stability of the passivating film on bare steel surfaces is<br>
dependent on the pH level of the solution surrounding the steel. In the absence<br>
of interfering chloride or other ions, such a film has been shown to be produced<br>
and indefinitely maintained so as to effectively prevent corrosion when the pH is<br>
greater than 11.5. Thus, the high pH concrete pore solution is sufficient to<br>
maintain stable passivation films and corrosion should not occur.<br>
However, in practice this favourable state of affairs may change and<br>
depassivation may occur under two specific sets of conditions:<br>
(i) reduction of pH due to reaction with atmospheric CO2 (carbonation);<br>
and<br>
(ii) penetration of chloride ions into the concrete pore solution around the<br>
steel.<br><br>
It is known that, at sufficiently high concentrations, chloride ions can effectively<br>
destabilize the passivating film even when the normally high pH level associated<br>
with concrete water solutions remains unchanged. Hence, some pretreatment of<br>
the rebar is required to prevent this corrosion problem.<br>
Electroless metal deposition solutions (electroless plating solutions) deposit metal<br>
over a catalytically active surface by chemical reduction in the absence of an<br>
external electric circuit. Those solutions containing nickel are used in a wide<br>
range of industrial applications. Nickel-boron and nickel-phosphorus coatings are<br>
recognized in the art for their corrosion resistance, hardness and associated<br>
wear-resistance. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,726,170; 3,045,334;<br>
3,378,400; 3,738,849; 3,674,447; 3,432,338; 3,918,137; 4,395,442; 4,567,066;<br>
4,706,616; 4,724,819; 5,019,163; 5,148,780; and 6,178,306.<br>
Typical electroless nickel plating solutions generally comprise a water-soluble<br>
nickel salt, a water-soluble alloying salt (if an alloy is present), a reducing agent,<br>
and a chelating or complexing agent. Additives may also be added in relatively<br>
low concentrations to enhance various characteristics of the solution of plated<br>
article.<br>
One continuing need with respect of electroless nickel plating solutions has been<br>
the need to increase the stability of the solution. It has been found, however,<br>
that in certain instances the addition of stabilizers to meet this need interferes<br>
with the formation of the nickel coating, in that during the formation of the nickel<br>
coating the accelerator co-deposits in the nickel. Some stabilizers are also<br>
known to cause discoloration of the deposit.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an electroless nickel<br>
coating solution for coating thermo-mechanical treated (TMT) rebar with an<br>
increased stability without interfering with the formation of the nickel coating.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for electroless<br>
nickel coating of thermo-mechanical treated (TMT) rebar without removing oxide<br>
scales.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a nickel-phosphorus<br>
alloy coating on rebar surfaces for obtaining the desired bond strength with<br>
concrete and significant improvement of corrosion resistance property.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by using an<br>
electroless nickel plating composition for coating thermo mechanical treatement<br>
(TMT) rebars with nickel-phosphorus alloy.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the present invention provides an electroless nickel<br>
coating composition comprising at least one each of a water soluble nickel salt, a<br>
reducing agent, a complexing agent, and a stabilizer. Nickel is derived from the<br>
water soluble nickel salt. The water soluble nickel salt is selected from a group<br>
consisting of any one, some, or all of nickel chloride, nickel sulphate, nickel<br>
formate, nickel acetate and nickel hypophosphide. The nickel salt is preferably<br><br>
nickel sulphate. The composition of the present invention having nickel-<br>
phosphorus, nickel-boron, or close to 100 % pure nickel will depend on the<br>
reducing agent used. The reducing agent used is selected from a group<br>
consisting of any one, some or all of hypophosphorus acid, hypophosphites,<br>
borohydrides, dimethylamine borane, trimethylamine borane, hydrazine,<br>
thiosulphates, and ascorbates. The reducing agent is preferably hypophosphide<br>
and hydrazine.<br>
The complexing agent can be selected from a group consisting of any one, some<br>
or all of ammonia and organic complex forming agents containing one or more<br>
functional groups selected from the group consisting of primary amino,<br>
secondary amino, tertiary amino, amino, carboxy and hydroxy. The complexing<br>
agent can be selected from a group consisting of any one, some or aU of<br>
ethylenediamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, triethylenetriamine,<br>
sodium citrate, sodium pyrophosphate, organic acids, water soluble salts of<br>
organic acids, and amino acids. The organic acid can be selected from a group<br>
consisting of maleic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric<br>
acid, and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid.<br>
The stabilizers used can be divided into the following classes,<br>
(i) compounds of group VI elements: S; Se; Te;<br>
(ii) compounds containing oxygen: As02,103, M0O4 ;<br>
(iii) heavy metal cations : Sn + +, Pb + +, Hg +, Sb + + +; and<br>
(iv) unsaturated organic acids: maleic, itaconic.<br><br>
The electroless nickel layer can be deposited on a substrate by contacting the<br>
substrate with the composition of the present invention. The composition of the<br>
electroless nickel coating will depend on the bath chemistry and pH. The<br>
deposition rate of Ni depends on the bath temperature and pH and the Ni<br>
percentage in the coating will depend mainly on the bath pH.<br>
The electroless process can be used for depositing a Ni-P alloy layer on a<br>
substrate, for example TMT rebar surface by contacting the substrate with the<br>
composition of the present invention.<br>
The deposition of nickel phosphorus alloy on the rebar surface depends on the<br>
composition, the pH and temperature of the bath. The pH of the composition is<br>
preferably between 3 and 11.<br>
The bath temperature can be maintained at 70 - 95° C for alloy deposition at the<br>
optimum rate. The presence of stabilizer hastens the deposition rate upto a<br>
certain ppm level. Above the critical limit the stabilizer can even stop the<br>
deposition completely.<br>
A bath temperature of 85 - 95° C and pH 5 - 7 can be provided when organic<br>
acid is used as complexing agent and sodium hypophosphorus is used as<br>
reducing agent.<br><br>
When pyrophosphate or ammonia is used as complexing agent and hydrazine is<br>
used as reducing agent, the bath temperature 70 - 80° C and pH is ~ 10.5.<br>
The stabiiizer concentration in the composition is ~ 0.05 to 10 mg/l, preferably<br>
between 0.5 to 1.5 ppm thiourea .<br>
The coating thickness is directly proportional to treatment time. After electroless<br>
nickel (EN) treatment all samples are rinsed in tap water and dried in open<br>
atmosphere subsequently. Surface appearance of the electroless nickel (EN)<br>
coated samples are bright.<br>
The plating composition preferably has an effective nickel ion concentration of<br>
0.01 to 1 mol/l.<br>
The effective concentration of reducing agent in the plating composition is 0.01<br>
to 1.0 mol / I.<br>
The effective concentration of complex agent in the composition is ~ 0.01 to 2.0<br>
mol/l.<br>
The electroless nickel coating of the present invention on the surface of rebar<br>
bundle provides significant improvement in corrosion resistance property in a<br>
concrete environment.<br><br>
According to the present invention separate pickling operation to coat nickel-<br>
phosphorous alloy on steel substrate is not required. The surface treatment can<br>
be done on individual rebar as well as on a bundle consisting of multiple rebars.<br>
The coating developed on TMT rebar according to this invention is also<br>
applicable for TMT, TMT CRS as well as CTD bars. Electroless nickel coated<br>
rebar satisfy the requirement of bond strength with concrete. The electroless<br>
nickel coated material shows significant improvement in corrosion resistance<br>
against chloride / simulated alkaline concrete environments compared to bare<br>
steel.<br>
The thermo-mechanical treated (TMT) bar in the present invention is coated by<br>
nickel-phosphorus alloy through electroless route without removing oxide scale<br>
from the steel substrate. Coating property very much depends on composition,<br>
temperature, dipping time and pH of the bath solution, electro-less nickel (EN)<br>
coated reinforcing bars showed significant improvement in corrosion resistance<br>
against chloride and it satisfy the requirement of bond strength with concrete.<br>
In the present invention, by developing the optimum electroless nickel (EN)<br>
process, it has been possible to provide adequate corrosion protection of thermo-<br>
mechanical treated (TMT) rebar in concrete environment. The electroless<br>
coating of the present invention can also be applied on thermo-mechanical<br>
treated (TMT), cold rolled steel (CRS) and CTD bars.<br><br>
