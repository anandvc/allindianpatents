				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the priority of German<br>
Application No. 198 55 571.7 filed December 2, 1998, which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a feeding device for<br>
advancing fiber material to a textile fiber processing<br>
machine, such as a carding machine or a fiber cleaner. The<br>
fiber feeding device includes a slowly rotating feed roll<br>
cooperating with a feed tray assembly formed of individual<br>
feed tray segments. Further, a rapidly rotating opening<br>
roll is provided which is arranged immediately downstream<br>
of the feed tray assembly as viewed in the direction of<br>
fiber advance. One end of each feed tray segment is<br>
mounted on a fixed supporting element.<br>
German (Aplication published<br>
without, examination*- No. 34J3 595 discloses a feeder which<br>
is disposed upstream of a carding machine. The apparatus<br>
has a teed chute in the upper part of which an opening roll<br>
is provided and thereabove a feed roll is positioned to<br>
which fiber tufts are advanced via a feed tray assembly<br><br>
composed of closely side-by-side arranged individual feed<br>
tray segments. Each feed tray segment is pivotal about an<br>
axis oriented parallel to the feed roll axis. The feed<br>
tray segments are caused by the fiber tufts to undergo<br>
excursions which represent the mass of the fiber tufts<br>
contacting the respective feed tray segment. The feed tray<br>
assembly is positioned at the outlet of a reserve chute<br>
which is situated above the feed chute. The shaft to which<br>
the feed tray segments are secured projects beyond the two<br>
outermost feed tray segments and is situated adjacent the<br>
impervious lateral walls of the reserve chute. It is a<br>
disadvantage of such an arrangement that the shaft which<br>
extends over the entire width of the machine sags and<br>
therefore it cannot be used for roller card units having a<br>
substantial width of, for example, 3 m or more. Further,<br>
deformations may adversely affect an easy rotatability of<br>
the feed tray segments. Also, the distance between the<br>
feed -ray segments, on the one hand, and the feed roll, on<br>
the other hand, disadvantageous^ changes and further, the<br>
pressing forces are not uniform between the feed tray<br>
segments, on the one hand, and the feed roll, on the other<br>
hand. Also, the clearance between adjoining feed tray<br>
segments may change or be distorted which may lead to<br>
operational disturbances. It is yet anothej drawback of<br>
the conventional arrangements that an adaptation of the<br><br>
feeding device to various types of fiber material,<br>
particularly various fiber lengths, is not feasible.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an<br>
improved feeding device of the above-outlined type from<br>
which the discussed disadvantages are eliminated and which,<br>
in particular, is structurally simple and operationally<br>
reliable and makes possible a precise clamping of the fiber<br>
material between the feed tray segments and the feed roll.<br>
This object and others to become apparent as the<br>
specification progresses, are accomplished by the<br>
invention, according to which, briefly stated,The feeding<br>
device for advancing fiber material includes/a driven feed<br>
roll; a support member immovably held during operation and<br>
extending spaced from and generally parallel to the feed<br>
roll; and a feed tray assembly composed of a plurality of<br>
side-by-side positioned feed tray segments. Each feed tray<br>
segment is of a resilient material and has a first portion<br>
(end portion) immovably affixed to the support member and a<br>
movable, second portion having a surface oriented toward<br>
the feed roll and cooperating therewith for advancing the<br>
fiber material passing through a nip defined between the<br>
feed tell and each feed tray segment. The second portion<br><br>
of each feed tray segment is displaceable toward and away<br>
from the feed roll.<br>
By affixing, according to the invention, one end of<br>
the feed tray segments to a common, stable and immovable<br>
supporting element, a linear orientation of the feed tray<br>
segments is ensured in a simple manner, and between the<br>
feed tray segments and the feed roll in all regions the<br>
same pressing forces related to the unit length of the feed<br>
roll is maintained. At the same time undesired<br>
deformations between adjoining feed tray segments is<br>
avoided, whereby the operational reliability and uniformity<br>
of the advanced fiber material are improved It is a<br>
particular advantage of the invention that stationary,<br>
immovable machine components, including, for example, the<br>
machiie frame, the machine stand, walls and connecting<br>
elements may be used to support the feed tray segments.<br>
The supporting element which is, for, example, affixed to<br>
the machine frame is compact and rigid. Thus, by firmly<br>
affixing the feed tray segments at an end thereof which is<br>
immovable, the feed tray segments are integrated into the<br>
machine structure.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Turning to Figure 1, upstream of a non-illustrated<br>
carding machine a card feeder CF is disposed which may be,<br>
for example, a DIRECTFEED model manufactured by Triitzschler<br>
GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Monchengladbach, Germany. The card feeder<br>
CF is provided with a vertically oriented reserve chute 2<br>
charged from the top with a mixture I composed of air and<br><br>
finely opened fiber material. Such a feed may be effected<br>
by a condenser via a supply and distributor duct 3. In the<br>
upper region of the reserve chute 2 air outlet openings 4<br>
are provided through which the transporting air II passes<br>
into a suction device 5 after being separated from the<br>
fiber tufts III. The lower end of the reserve chute 2 is<br>
closed off by a feed roll 6 which cooperates with a feed<br>
tray assembly 7 composed of a plurality of serially<br>
arranged feed tray segments 7a, as shown, for example, in<br>
Figure 14b. The slowly rotating feed roll 6 draws the<br>
fiber material III from the reserve chute 2 and advances it<br>
to a rapidly rotating opening roll 8 which may be provided<br>
wit:h pins 8b or may have a sawtooth clothing. The feed<br>
roll rotates clockwise as indicated by the arrow 6a whereas<br>
the opening roll 8 rotates counterclockwise so that<br>
oppositely oriented rotations of the two rolls are<br>
obtained.<br>
One part of the circumference of the opening roll 8<br>
projects into a feed chute 9 which adjoins the reserve<br>
chute 2. The opening roll 8, as it rotates in the<br>
direction of the arrow 8a, advances the fiber material III<br>
to tie feed chute 9 which, at its Lower end, has a rotary<br>
pull-off roll 10. The pull-off roll 10, in turn, advances<br>
the fiber material (fiber lap) to the non-illustrated<br>
carding machine.<br><br>
The walls of the feed chute 9 are provided in the<br>
lower part thereof with air outlet openings 11', 11' . The<br>
upper portion of the feed chute 9 is in communication with<br>
a space 12 with which the pressure outlet of a fan 13<br>
communicates. By means of the rotating feed roll 6 and the<br>
opening roll 8 a predetermined quantity of fiber material<br>
III is continuously supplied to the feed chute 9 and an<br>
equal quantity of fiber material (fiber lap) is withdrawn<br>
by the withdrawing roll 10. The latter cooperates with a<br>
feed tray assembly 14 composed of a plurality of serially<br>
arranged feed tray segments 14a, The feeding (fiber lap<br>
withdrawing) arrangement 10, 14 introduces the fiber lap to<br>
the non-illustrated carding machine. To uniformly density<br>
and maintain constant the fiber quantities, in the feed<br>
cnute 9 the fiber material is exposed to an air stream from<br>
the space 12, driven by the fan 13. The air is drawn into<br>
the fan 13 and driven through the fiber mass dwelling in<br>
tne feed chute 9 and, thereafter, the air exits through the<br>
air outlet openings 11', 11' ' at the lower end portion of<br>
the feed chute 9.<br>
The opening roll 8 is surrounded by a wall of a<br>
housing 15, while the feed roll 6 is surrounded by a wall<br>
of a housing 16; the walls are adapted to the circular<br>
configuration of the rolls 6 and 8. As viewed in the<br>
rotary direction 8a of the opening roll 8, the housing 12<br><br>
is interrupted by a separating opening for the fiber<br>
material III. The separating opening is adjoined by the<br>
wall face which reaches to the feed roll 6. The feed tray<br>
assembly 7 is arranged at the lower end of the wall face<br>
situated opposite the feed roll 6. The edge of the feed<br>
tray assembly 7 is oriented in the direction of rotation 8a<br>
of the opening roll 8. The plane which contains the rotary<br>
axis of the feed roll 6 and the opening roll 8 is arranged<br>
at an oblique angle to the vertical plane containing the<br>
rotary axis of the opening roll 8 and is inclined in the<br>
rotary direction of the opening roll 8. The wall face 2a<br>
of the reserve chute 2 forms a stationary support element<br>
17 of the machine frame 18. The feed tray segments 7a of<br>
the feed tray assembly 7 are in the region of one of their<br>
ends 7' mounted on the stationary support element 17<br>
whereas their respective other ends 1' are freely movable.<br>
One end 7' is immovably secured to the support element 17<br>
of the machine frame 18. The feed tray assembly 7 is made<br>
of an elastic material, whereby the free ends 7' of the<br>
individual feed tray elements 7a are freely movable in the<br>
direction of the arrows A and B.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a fiber cleaning device which is<br>
accoinmodated in a closed housing 26 and which may be a CVT<br>
cleaner manufactured by Trutzschler GmbH &amp; Co. KG- The<br>
fiber material to be cleaned, particularly cotton, is<br><br>
supplied to the cleaner in fiber tuft form. This is<br>
effected, for example, by a non-illustrated feed chute, by<br>
a feed belt or the like. The fiber lap is advanced to a<br>
rapidly rotating pin roll 23 (having a diameter, for<br>
example, of 250 mm) by a withdrawing roll (feed roll) 21<br>
ami a feed tray assembly 22 cooperating therewith to effect<br>
clamping of the fiber lap. The pin roll 23 is rotatably<br>
supported in the housing and rotates in the direction of<br>
the arrow 23b. The pin roll 23 is followed by clothed<br>
rolls 24 and 25. The clothed roll 24 is provided with a<br>
sawtooth clothing and has a diameter of, for example, 250<br>
mm. The pin roll 23 has a circumferential speed of, for<br>
example, 15 m/sec while the roll 24 has a circumferential<br>
of, for example 20 m/sec. The circumferential speed of the<br>
roll. 25 is greater than that of the roll 24; the diameter<br>
of t:he roll 24 is, for example, 250 mm. The pin roll 23 is<br>
closely surrounded by the housing 26 and cooperates with a<br>
separating opening 29 for the exit of fiber impurities.<br>
The size of the opening 29 may be adapted to the degree of<br>
dirt of the cotton. The separating opening 29 is bordered<br>
by a severing edge, for example, a mote knife.<br>
The feeding device is formed of the slowly rotating<br>
feed roll 21 which rotates in the direction of the arrow<br>
21a and the feed tray assembly 2/- which is disposed above<br>
the reed roll 21. The feed tray assembly 22 is, at one end<br><br>
2.2a, supported on an immovable support element 27 of the<br>
stationary housing 26. A spring 28 engages the outer upper<br>
face 22' of the feed tray assembly 22 for resiliently<br>
urging the feed tray assembly 22 toward the feed roll 21<br>
which is rotatably but radially immovably supported. The<br>
feed tray 22 is composed of a plurality of feed tray<br>
elements whose free ends are movable in the direction of<br>
the arrows A and B. The feed tray assembly 22 is<br>
structured similarly to the earlier described feed tray<br>
assembly 7.<br>
The above-described cleaner operates as follows:<br>
The fiber lap composed of fiber tufts is advanced by<br>
the feed roll 21 in cooperation with the feed tray assembly<br>
22	under the clamping effect of the pin roll 23 which combs<br>
the fiber material III and entrains fiber clumps on its<br>
pins. As the circumferential surface portions of the roll<br>
23	pass by the separating opening 29 and the mote knife 30,<br>
short fibers and coarse impurities are thrown out by<br>
centrifugal force from the fiber material through the<br>
separating opening 29 as a function of the circumferential<br>
spoed and curvature of the roll 23 as well as a function of<br>
the size of the separating opening 29 adapted to the first<br>
separating stage. The thus pre-cleaned fiber material is<br>
taken over by the clothing points 24a of the clothed roll<br>
24	irom the first roll (pin roil) 23, as a result of which<br><br>
the fiber material is further opened. Thereafter, the<br>
fiber material is taken over by the clothing points 25a of<br>
the roll 25 which is situated downstream of the roll 24 as<br>
viewed in the working direction C and as a result, the<br>
fiber material is still further opened and eventually is<br>
transported to a non-illustrated further processing machine<br>
by a pneumatic removal apparatus 31.<br>
The apparatus illustrated in Figure 3a is a feeder<br>
for a roller card unit and corresponds essentially to the<br>
card feeder of Figure 1. While the working width in a card<br>
feeder is approximately 1-1.5 m, this dimension is 3 m or<br>
more in a roller card feeder. The feeder includes a<br>
hollow, cross-sectionally rectangular carrier beam 35 which<br>
may be made of structural steel. The carrier beam 35 is<br>
stable and resists bending and has a length of about 5 m.<br>
Between the carrier beam 35 and the feed roll 6 a feed tray<br>
assembly 7 is provided which is composed, as described<br>
before, of a plurality of feed tray segments 7a secured to<br>
a support element 17. The feed tray segments are<br>
resiliently supported by a rubber spring rod 36 which is<br>
counter supported on the throughgoing, fixedly held carrier<br>
beam counter support 35). Further, for each feed tray<br>
segment 7a an abutment element 37 is provided which limits<br>
the excursion of the feed tray elements 7a in the direction<br>
A, B. The feed tray assembly is an integral, one-piece<br><br>
component composed of a throughgoing securing region 7i<br>
expending over the width of the machine and of the<br>
individual feed tray segments 7a. Each feed tray segment<br>
7a is formed of a feed tray body 72 and a narrow connecting<br>
region 73 which functions as an elastic connection and is<br>
stiuctured essentially as a leaf spring. The connecting<br>
region 73 couples the feed tray body 72 with the securing<br>
region 71. The securing region 1\ has a perpendicularly<br>
oriented projection 74 which extends into a recess 17'<br>
of the support element 17 and is immobilized by a securing<br>
screw-and-nut assembly 38, 39. The support element 17 with<br>
the feed tray segments 7a, on the one hand, and the carrier<br>
bean 35, on the other hand, are secured independently from<br>
one another on the rigid lateral walls of the machine. The<br>
support element 17 together with the feed tray segments 7a<br>
and the carrier beam 35 may be adjustable when not in<br>
operation so that for different types of fiber material the<br>
distance and thus the intake gap between the feed tray<br>
segments 7a and the feed roll 6 may be suitably varied. It<br>
is, however, in the alternative, also feasible to provide a<br>
stationary and immovable securement of the support element<br>
17 aid the carrier beam 35.<br>
Turning to Figure 4, with the feed tray body 72 of<br>
each reed tray segment 7a ar inductive path sensor 39 is<br>
assoc ated which is composed of a plunger armature and a<br><br>
plunger coil and is connected to an electronic control and<br>
regulating device as shown in Figure 19. In this manner,<br>
upon oscillation of the feed tray segments 7a electric<br>
pulses are generated which represent the tray segment<br>
excursions in response to thickness variations of the<br>
fibers which pass through the intake gap between the feed<br>
tray assembly 7 and the feed roll 6. The feed tray<br>
segments 7a are provided with a wear-resistance layer, for<br>
example, a high grade steel plating 41 on the side which<br>
contacts the fiber material.<br>
According to Figure 5, each feed tray segment 7a has<br>
a connecting part 73 which couples the tray segment body 72<br>
with the support element 17 to which it is secured at 71<br>
The resiliency of each feed tray segment 7a is ensured by<br>
the weakening notches 75 provided in the connecting part 73<br>
in the vicinity of its securement 71 .<br>
Turning to Figure 6, the required clamping forces for<br>
holding the fiber material against the opening forces of<br>
the afcer-connected opening roll 8 are applied - in<br>
addition to the inherent resiliency of the feed tray<br>
segments - by a respective further spring 28 (such as a<br>
compression spring) which is positioned between a rearward<br>
face 7" of each feed tray segment 7a and the carrier beam<br>
35. The inherent, resiliency of the feed tray elements is<br>
obtained by the particular configuration of their elastic<br><br>
material such as steel, aluminum, synthetic material or<br>
wood.<br>
In Figure 7, the pressing spring 28 of each feed tray<br>
element 7a is positioned as close as possible to the<br>
maximum pressure location in the pressing zone for the<br>
finer material. The graph of Figure 7a shows the<br>
pressure/displacement (P/S) curve.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, in the feed tray body 72 of the<br>
individual feed tray elements 7a and in the carrier beam 35<br>
respective recesses 76 and 35i are provided for receiving<br>
the respective ends of elastic elements, such as springs<br>
28.<br>
According to Figure 9, the elastomer spring, for<br>
example, the rubber spring rod 36 which extends over the<br>
width of the machine, is glued to the feed tray segments<br>
7a.<br>
In Figure 10, as an elastic element a composite<br>
component is used which is formed of a rubber spring 36<br>
bonded to a metal element 40 which, in turn, is attached to<br>
the carrier beam 35.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, the elastic element may be a<br>
hollow rubber bar 36.<br>
Figure 12 shows how all the feed tray elements 7a are<br>
biasea by a round rubber bar which extends over the entire<br>
widin of the machine.<br><br>
Figure 13 illustrates that the entire feed tray<br>
assembly 7 is made as a one-piece, integral component. The<br>
yielding properties of each feed tray segment 7a are<br>
ensured by parallel spaced cuts which have a width f and<br>
between which the feed tray segments are defined.<br>
Turning to Figures 14a and 20a, the thickness (depth)<br>
of the feed tray body 72 is designated at d and may be, for<br>
example, 40-80 mm whereas its height is designated at e and<br>
may be, for example 200-300 mm. The overall dimension in<br>
the working direction is designated at c. A T-shaped<br>
recess 77 is provided in the feed tray body 72 to receive<br>
the end of an abutment member 4 6 held on the carrier beam<br>
35. The abutment member 46 limits the excursions of the<br>
feed tray segments 7a in both directions. The projection<br>
74 has a throughgoing bore to receive the screw-and-nut<br>
asseirbly 38, 39 as also shown in Figure 3. The width of<br>
each feed tray segment 7a is designated at a in Figure 14b<br>
and may amount to approximately 80-120 mm. The feed tray<br>
segments 7a are.made of an elastic material whose surface<br>
oriented toward the fiber material is provided with a<br>
respective high grade steel plating 41.<br>
7urning to Figure IS, after plating, for example,<br>
with a high grade steel plate 41, a weakening notch 73 is<br>
provided to increase the resiliency of the feed tray<br>
segments 7a relative to their common support element 17.<br><br>
The steel plating is divided over the entire working width<br>
of the feed tray assembly 7 by the separating cuts and the<br>
plating sheet material is removed from the zones 71 and 73.<br>
In accordance with Figure 16, in addition to the<br>
steel plating 41 for the individual segments 7a, over the<br>
entire width of the machine a sheet metal cover member 42<br>
is installed which extends from the securing zone at the<br>
support element 17 down to the upper part of the segment<br>
body 72 of the feed tray segments 7a. The cover plate 42<br>
may also serve as an abutment.<br>
As shown in Figure 17, a holding element 44 is<br>
provided which counter supports the spring rod 36 and which<br>
is movable by two links 4 3a and 4 3b connected with the<br>
machine frame. A spring 4 5 urges the holding element<br>
against the spring rod 36.<br>
According to Figure 18, on the carrier beam 35 an<br>
abutting element 4 6 is provided which is connected with a<br>
projection 47 (such as a screw or the like) mounted on the<br>
tray segment, body 72 in such a manner that the excursion in<br>
the direction B is limited. In this manner, a contacting<br>
between the feed tray body 72 and the feed roll 6 is<br>
prevented. The length of the projection 47 may be adjusted<br>
and thus the qap width may be set.<br>
Turninc to Figure 19, the inductive path sensors 39a<br>
are connected with an electronic control and regulating<br><br>
device 4 9, for example, a microcomputer to which there are<br>
also connected an rpm-regulated motor 50 for the feed roll<br>
6. The setting signals emitted by the control and<br>
regulating device 49 may be also used for a plurality of<br>
setting members distributed along the width b of the<br>
machine, for example, for setting the depth of a chute.<br>
According to Figure 20b, the elongated support<br>
element 17 is, at its frontal face, mounted on the inner<br>
walls of the stationary machine walls 48a and 48b. The<br>
inner machine width b is approximately 1,000-1,400 mm.<br>
