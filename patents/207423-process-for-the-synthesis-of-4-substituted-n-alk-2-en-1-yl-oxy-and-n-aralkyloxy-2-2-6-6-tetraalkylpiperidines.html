PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF 4-SUBSTITUTED<br>
N-r(ALK-2-EN-l-YUOXY1- AND N-ARALKYLOXY-<br>
2.2.6.6-TETRAALKYLPIPERIDINES<br>
The instant process pertains to an environmentally friendly process for making 4-functionalized N-OR derivatives of 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidines.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The hydrogen peroxide oxidation of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidines with hydrogen peroxide alone, or with carbonate catalyst, of with divalent metal catalyst is known. United States Patent Nos. 5,654,434 and 5,777,126 describe the oxidation using hydrogen peroxide alone. United States Patent No. 5,629,426 discloses the use of carbonate catalyzed hydrogen peroxide oxidations. United States Patent No. 5,416,215 describes the use of divalent metal catalysts for the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction.<br>
E. G. Rozantsev et al., Synthesis, 1971, 190 disclose the use of tungstate catalyst for the hydrogen peroxide oxidation of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidines.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,204,473 describes the use of tert-butyl hydroperoxide for the oxidation of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidines to the<br><br>
corresponding N-oxyl compounds. I. Q. Li et al., MacromolecuIesi996, 29, 8554 and T. J. Connolly et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1996, 37, 4919 describe the use of di-tert-butyl peroxide for the same purpose.<br>
G. G. Barclay et al., Macromolecules, 1997, (30), 1929 describe the formation of a diadduct of a nitroxyl with an activated double bond (styrene).<br>
L. J. Johnson et al., J. of Organic Chem., 1986, (51), 2806 describe the photochemical hydrogen atom abstraction by nitroxyls followed by N-OR formation.<br>
T. J. Connolly et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1997, (38), 1133 disclose the thermal abstraction of benzylic hydrogen atoms followed by N-OR formation.<br>
I. A. Opeida et al., Kinetics and Catalysts, 1995, (36), 441 (translation from Russian) also describe the thermal abstraction of benzylic hydrogen atoms.<br>
The instant process differs significantly from each of these prior art references and provides the use of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide with water as an oxidation by-product. The formation of 4-functionalized N-OR ' derivatives is obtained without the use of organic peroxides and hydroperoxides.<br>
Detailed Disclosure<br>
The instant process involves two steps for the preparation of a selected N-OR derivative of the 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidines with a third step involving the recycling of the N-OH obtained concomitantly with the desired N-OR compound back to the corresponding N-oxyl starting material for the second step.<br><br><br><br>
Step 3 (recycling the N-OH compound formed in Step 2 back to the N-oxyl compound needed as intermediate for Step 2)<br><br>
In the formulas A, B, C and D,<br>
G1 and G2 are independently alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably methyl, or G1 and G2 together are pentamethylene;<br>
X is hydrogen, hydroxyl, oxo, -NH-CO-E, -O-CO-E or -NH-CO-NH-E, where E is alkyl of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, said alkyl substituted by hydroxyl or E is aryl of 6 to 10 carbon atoms; and<br>
R is as defined below.<br><br>
In Step 2, the R-H compound is an allylic, benzylic or activated methine compound where the H-atom is highly vulnerable to being extracted by the N-oxyl radical so that the two equivalents of N-oxyl compound essentially react with one equivalent of R-H compound to undergo a disproportionation reaction give one equivalent of N-OR and one equivalent of N-OH. For environmental and economic concerns, it is most expedient to recycle the N-OH compound prepared in Step 3 back to the starting N-oxyl intermediate needed in Step 2.<br>
Preferably, in the compounds of R-H which are allylic in nature, R is an alkenyl of 3 to 20 carbon atoms such as cyclohexene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, cyclo- • octene, 1-octene, allylbenzene, a-methylstyrene or (3-methylstyrene (1-phenyl-l-propene), and in the compounds of R-H which are benzylic, R-H is a compound of formula Y-CH-Z where Y and Z are independently, hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 10 carbon atoms or said aryl substituted by one to four alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, provided that at least one of Y and Z is aryl and where is Y is aryl, then Z can be part of a fused ring system having methylene groups such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, diphenylmethane, ethylbenzene, mesitylene or durene.<br>
Most preferably, in Step 2, the compound R-H is cyclohexene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, cyclooctene, 1-octene, a-methylstyrene, (3-methylstyrene, toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, diphenylmethane or ethylbenzene.<br>
Most preferably, in Step 2, the oxyl compound of formula B is l-oxyl-4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, l-oxyl-4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine, l-oxyl-4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine or l-oxyl-4-benzoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine.<br>
The instant invention also pertains tothe independent process of Step 2 and to the independent process comprising Step 2 and Step 3 together as follows:<br><br>
Step 2 (reacting two equivalents of N-oxyl with one allylic, benzylic or activated methine compound (R-H) to form one equivalent of N-OH and one equivalent of N-OR compound)<br><br><br><br><br>
Step 2 (reacting two equivalents of N-oxyl with one allylic, benzylic or ctivated methine compound (R-H) to form one equivalent of N-OH and one quivalent of N-OR compound)<br><br>
separating the N-OH and N-OR compounds.<br>
Preferably, in Step 1 and in Step 3, the concentration of aqueous hydrogen leroxide is 30% by weight or higher. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide of 30%, 50% or '0% by weight are effective.<br>
Step 1 and Step 3 can be carried out where the hydrogen peroxide nidation as taught by United States Patent Nos. 5,654,434 and 5,777,126 without :atalyst; or as taught by United States Patent No. 5,629,426 using a carbonate :atalyst.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide oxidation of Step 1 and Step 3 can also be carried out in the presence of a tungstate catalyst or divalent metal salts.<br><br>
Step 2 can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent such a chlorobenzene.<br>
Step 2 can be carried out at a temperature of 50 to 140°C at atmospheric pressure or at 50 to 140°C in a pressure vessel.<br>
The following examples are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.<br><br>
