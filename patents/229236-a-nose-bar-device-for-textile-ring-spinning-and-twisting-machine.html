				<td>NOSE BAR DEVICE FOR A TEXTILE RING SPINNING AND TWISTING<br>
MACHINE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a non-spherical nose bar device for textile ring spinning and twisting machine to suitably accommodate short bottom aprons in the drafting zone. The invention more particularly relates to a non-spherical nose bar device that provides tensioning to the bottom apron to prevent slip of the fibre. Background and Prior art<br>
Ring spinning machines are used for the production of yam from the roving fed. Normally the ring spinning machine comprises a spindle rail to carry predetermined number of spindles arranged at predetermined pitch arranged on both side of the machine. The conical tubes on which the yam is wound are fitted to the spindles and driven by suitable drive means. Ring rails arranged coaxial to the spindle rail and carries spinning ring and traveler assembly of same number and pitch as that of spindle. The ring rails further provided with means for travel up and down in a direction traverse to the spindle axis for the built up of yarn on to the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles.<br>
Roving bobbins of equal number as that of the spindles are arranged in a creel member attached to the ring spinning machine for the introduction of roving into the drafting arrangement, through suitable guide means for drafting. The drafted roving is subsequently wound on the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles by the ring and ring traveler assembly and the cop built up takes place.<br>
US 5479680 "Sliver drafting apparatus", depicts a drafting apparatus for drafting a sliver in the yam spinning machine preferably comprises upper and lower inlet rollers , upper and lower apron belts, upper and lower apron belt guides and upper and lower outlet rollers. The upper apron belt passes around the upper inlet roller and the upper apron belt guide and the lower apron belt passes around the lower inlet roller and the lower apron belt guide and further guided around an apron guide roller and cooperates with the upper apron belt to define a nipping area between the belts for nipping the fiber sliver as it passes between the upper and lower inlet rollers while being sandwiched between the upper and lower apron belts The sliver is nipped in the nipping area and is subsequently directed by the belts to a nip formed between the upper and lower outlet rollers. The arrangement is such that the sliver is caused to move around a generally S-shaped path and is preferably trapped over the majority of the movement along this path between the two belts. This results in excellent guidance of the fiber and<br><br>
high uniformity of the spun yam. The apron guide roller provided to guide the   lower<br>
apron among other things acts as a tensioner for the lower apron.<br>
The tension roller is incorporated to provide a necessary tension to the bottom apron<br>
and to provide a slip free movement of the bottom apron in the drafting zone to<br>
facilitate proper fibre control which is essential for the production of quality yam. Such<br>
an arrangement of bottom apron with tension arrangement provides limited enveloping<br>
of the bottom apron over the middle drafting roller. It is found in practice that more<br>
enveloping of the bottom apron over the bottom drafting roller will provide movement<br>
of the bottom apron over the nose bar with minimum slippage, which will be<br>
advantageous for proper guidance of the floating fibres in the drafting zone.<br>
Ring spinning machines employ drafting arrangement which is constructed with shorter<br>
aprons to enhance the enveloping of the bottom roller over the knurled portion of the<br>
bottom drafting roller to minimize the slip. Such known arrangements are not provided<br>
with  tensioning  arrangement  for  the  tensioning  of the  bottom  apron.   This   is<br>
disadvantageous due to the fact that the bottom aprons are likely to get elongated over a<br>
period of time of working. The elongation of the bottom apron results in the slip which<br>
will affect the quality of yam produced by the ring spinning frame. The elongation of<br>
bottom apron necessitates frequent changing. This is not only expensive but also will<br>
reduce the efficiency of the machine since the machine has to be essentially stopped for<br>
the replacement of the bottom aprons.<br>
More over such known arrangements are provided with plurality of nose bars, each<br>
such nose bar is provided to guide only two bottom apron of adjacent spindles. Since<br>
such arrangement employs more number of nose bar sections, the setting of the drafting<br>
zone is very difficult.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a non-spherical nose bar<br>
device for a textile ring spinning frame with means provided for effective tensioning of<br>
the short bottom aprons.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a nose bar to cater to the staff length<br>
needed for ring spinning and textile machinery.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a nose bar to provide better<br>
enveloping of the bottom apron over the middle drafting roller.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved non-spherical nose bar device in a Textile Ring spinning and Twisting machine to provide guiding and tensioning arrangement for the bottom apron. The nose bar device is disposed between the middle and front drafting rollers, with a tensioning arrangement provided for the tensioning of the short bottom apron. The nose bar device of the present invention comprises primarily two parts, a non-spherical nose bar member and a plurality of guide members. The nose bar member comprises a base having a plurality of through-holes and a plurality of projection-receptors. The guide members are provided to support two bottom aprons of adjacent spindles. The guide members have a plurality of projections to accommodate compression springs, and also have a plurality of lugs to provide a snap-on-fit.

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention are now explained by referring to the accompanied figures. Referring, initially to Fig. 1, wherein, a complete system depicting the drafting arrangement (DA) is shown. The drafting arrangement (DA) is normally provided with rear bottom drafting roller (7), middle bottom drafting roller (1) and fi"ont bottom drafting roller (2) all being driven by suitable drive means. Guide arm (8) is provided to the drafting arrangement (DA) to support a plurality of top rollers (9a, 9b and 9c) and as well as to apply the required draft pressure on the bottom drafting rollers (1, 2 &amp; 7). The fibre in the main drafting zone, ie. in the region between the middle drafting rollers (1,9b) and front drafting rollers (2,9a) is guided by the top apron (10) and bottom apron (5). The rotation of the middle bottom drafting roller (1) provides motion to the bottom apron (5) in the direction towards the front drafting rollers (2,9a). The top apron (10) is formed as an endless belt which envelops the top roller (9b) resting on the middle bottom drafting roller (1) and the apron cage (11). The bottom apron (5), which is also formed as an endless belt envelops the middle bottom drafting roller (1) and the nose bar member (3). When the top arm (8) is loaded, the top apron (10) attached to the top roller (9b) provided above the middle bottom drafting roller (1) makes contact with the bottom apron (5) attached to the rotating middle bottom drafting roller (1). The rotation of the bottom apron (5) rotates the top apron (10) in a direction towards the front drafting roller (2,9a). The top apron (10) also rotates the top roller (9b) in a direction towards the front drafting rollers (2,9a). The fibre (F) delivered fi'om the nip formed by the rear bottom drafting roller (7) and top roller (9c) is fed to the nip formed by the bottom apron (5) and top apron (10), The fibre is then guided to the nip formed by the front bottom drafting roller (2) and top roller (9a) by the bottom apron (5) and the top apron (10). The bottom drafting rollers (1, 2 &amp; 7) are driven at differential speed by the drafting roller drive system and the fibre material is drafted as per the requirement. The drafted fibre is incorporated with necessary twist through its subsequent passage in the ring and ring traveler assembly and the yam is formed and wound on the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles, the spindles being mounted on spindle rails of the Ring spinning and twisting machine and driven by the spindle drive arrangement. (Not shown in the figures)<br><br>
Now, by generally referring to Figs. 2-8; Fig. 2 depicts an arrangement of middle drafting roller (1) and front drafting roller (2) with the nose bar device (3) for providing the tensioning arrangement. Referring to Fig. 3 that depicts the rear isometric view of the nose bar device, showing a single nose bar member (3) mated with a plurality of guide members (4). A plurality of fins (4d) disposed at the rear edge of each guide member (4) at the point of intersections between the vertical arm and horizontal arm with intervening gaps in between the fins (4d) to guide the plurality of aprons (5). (As shown in Fig.5)<br>
The nose bar device as shown in Fig 4 is an illustration of the frontal isometric view of the nose bar member (3) snap-fitted with plurality of guide members (4). The snap-fitting is achieved by mating plurality of tong shaped lugs on the guide members (4) with the through holes (3b) (Fig. 7) of the nose bar member (3). Fig 5 is an isometric view of the nose bar device (3) depicting a plurality of aprons (5) mounted on the outer surface of said nose bar device. The aprons (5) are permitted to pass through the intervening gaps formed between the fin-shaped projections (4d) that are disposed on the rear end of the guide members (4). The intervening gaps between the fin projections (4d) are used to prevent the lateral movement of the aprons (5) during drafting sessions. This is more advantageous for proper guidance of the floating fibres in the drafting zone of the textile machines.<br>
The nose bar device (3) shown in Fig. 3, 6 and 8 is constructed to cater to the staff length. For instance, in the event of a textile ring spinning and twisting machine having 8 spindles of (not shown in these figures), the adoption of nose bar device (3) of the present invention simplifies the setting of the drafting zone. The Ring spinning and twisting machines are constructed in sections. The staff length is length of each section. The staff length varies depending on the requirement of the manufacturer of the ring frame. In the present invention, a system with 8-spindle staff length is adopted for illustrative purpose only. However, this should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br>
The known devices with short apron are constructed with plurality of nose bars per section, where as in the present invention the nose bar is constructed to the full section length. The nose bar member (3) of the present invention comprises a pair of rectangular oppositely placed longer side walls disposed to form a flat-floored base form a base. The first side wall disposed vertically at right angle to floor of the base and the second side wall disposed at an obtuse angle to flat-floored base. A roof of the base<br><br>
extends laterally on both sides with one end of first side wall having protrusion and other end of the second side wall terminating as a butt. In a preferred embodiment the roof is partially elevated at the protrusion end and rests on the base to provide guiding path to the apron, alternatively the roof may be constructed as a curved surface. The nose bar member (3) is provided with plurality of projection-receptors (3a) and plurality of through-holes (3b) extending from first side wall to the second side wall of said base disposed adjacent to one another. One set of projection-receptors (3a) provided to accommodate the compression spring (6) from the guide members (4) and the second set of through-holes (3b) to provide a snap-on-fit to the lugs of the guide members (4) as shown in Fig. 8. The guide members (4) used in conjunction with the nose bar member (3) is shown separately in Fig. 7. Each such guide member (4) is provided to support two bottom aprons (5) of adjacent spindles. The plurality of guide members (4) is provided with a vertical and a horizontal arm disposed at obtuse angles to each other with the vertical arm longer than the horizontal arm. In the present invention as an exemplary embodiment a set of four guide members for each nose bar member. The number of guide members may vary depending upon the manufacturing and other parameters. The vertical and horizontal arms are arranged in the manner of the long back seat of the car with the back rest in a reclined position. A plurality of projections (4a) having blind holes (4b) within, is provided on the vertical arm of the guide members (4) to accommodate the compression spring (6). Each of the plurality of guide members (4) is further provided with a plurality of tong-shaped lugs (4c) disposed adjacent to the projections on the vertical arms to provide snap-on-fit when pressed into the plurality of through-holes (3b) arranged on the nose bar member (3). A plurality of fin-shaped projections (4d) disposed with intervening gaps on the rear end of the guide members (4) at the point of intersection of vertical and horizontal arms to provide guidance to the bottom apron (5).<br>
Fig 7 depicts the fitting of the nose bar member (3) to the plurality of guide members (4). The plurality of projections (4a) having compression springs (6) are inserted in a plurality of corresponding projection-receptors (3a) forming the first mating and the second mating is achieved by snap-fitting the plurality of tong-shaped lugs (4c) into the corresponding plurality of through-holes (3b). With this arrangement the guide members (4) are always held under pressure provided by the compression springs (6).
