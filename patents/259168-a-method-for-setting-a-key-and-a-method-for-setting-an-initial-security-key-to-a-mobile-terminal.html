Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to communication security technology, in<br>
particular, to a method for setting a key.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a network locking method in which an electronic key is hosted by network<br>
equipment, a mobile terminal is required to obtain a valid electronic key from a<br>
network side so as to operate normally after it is powered on. This is done by setting<br>
network locking function in the mobile terminal, i.e., by setting a security key in a<br>
security module of the mobile terminal, and correspondingly saving a security key in<br>
subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal in the equipment on the<br>
network side.<br>
When a mobile terminal obtains an electronic key from a network side,<br>
equipment associated with the network side obtains the saved security key<br>
corresponding to the mobile terminal from subscription data of the subscriber of the<br>
mobile terminal according to the subscriber card identity of the subscriber, and<br>
generates an electronic key according to the security key and then returns the<br>
generated electronic key to the mobile terminal. Here, subscriber card identity refers<br>
to the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of a subscriber card; however,<br>
it may also be a serial number of the subscriber card. In order to more clearly<br>
illustrate the invention, the term "subscriber card identity" hereafter refers to the<br>
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of a subscriber card. A security<br>
module of the mobile terminal determines whether the electronic key obtained from<br>
the equipment on the network side is valid or not according to the security key saved<br>
in the security module. If the electronic key is valid, then the mobile terminal is made<br>
to operate normally; otherwise, the mobile terminal is made to operate abnormally in<br>
a specified time period. Because the electronic key is generated according to the<br>
security key of the mobile terminal saved in the equipment associated with the<br>
network side and the security key is kept by the network operator, when a subscriber<br><br><br>
uses his/her mobile terminal in other networks, the mobile terminal cannot operate<br>
normally for the reason that no valid electronic key can be obtained by the security<br>
module. Therefore, network locking may be carried out for the mobile terminal. With<br>
respect to the network locking method in which an electronic key is hosted by<br>
network equipment, reference is made to Chinese Patent Application No.<br>
200410036742.6, titled "A METHOD OF AN EQUIPMENT TO VERIFY ITS<br>
VALIDITY", wherein "operation information" obtained by a first equipment from a<br>
second equipment corresponds to "electronic key" according to the invention; or<br>
reference is made to International Patent Application No. PCT/CN2004/001325,<br>
titled "A METHOD OF AN EQUIPMENT TO VERIFY ITS VALIDITY", wherein<br>
"verification information" obtained by a first equipment from a second equipment<br>
corresponds to "electronic key" according to the invention.<br>
In this method, an operation and maintenance password Pswd may be further<br>
set in the security module. The Pswd is used to control the setting of the network<br>
locking function on the mobile terminal and to make the mobile terminal operate<br>
normally by the subscriber inputting the Pswd correctly when the correct electronic<br>
key can not be obtained by the mobile terminal. Before the security module of the<br>
mobile terminal can not obtain the electronic key correctly and make the mobile<br>
terminal operate abnormally, the subscriber may be prompted to input'the Pswd via<br>
an interface, and after the correct Pswd is input, the mobile terminal is made to<br>
operate normally; or when the subscriber inputs a wrong Pswd for certain times, the<br>
mobile terminal is made to operate abnormally.<br>
For a mobile terminal leased out by an operator, the operator keeps this Pswd,<br>
but the subscriber of the leased mobile terminal cannot obtain this password, so the<br>
network locking function of the leased mobile terminal cannot be cancelled. As a<br>
result, a mobile terminal leased out by the operator cannot be used in the network of<br>
another operator. The operator may also make a mobile terminal leased out in a<br>
region to be used only in the region by limiting the access of the mobile terminal to<br>
the security key saved in the equipment on the network side, for example, a security<br><br><br>
key saved in a home region can only be accessed by a mobile terminal belonging to<br>
the home region. As a result, "cross-region use (that is, a mobile terminal obtained at<br>
a low price in a region is used in another region where the mobile terminal need to be<br>
obtained at a higher price)" caused by different marketing strategies of an operator<br>
for different regions may be avoided, so that the normal service of the operator may<br>
be ensured.<br>
The above network locking method has a lot of advantages, and the network<br>
locking function cannot be bypassed or cancelled by modifying a program in the<br>
mobile terminal. Therefore, a strong anti-attack ability can be obtained. However, for<br>
an operator, it becomes a problem how to set the network locking function for each<br>
mobile terminal after it has been obtained from a mobile terminal provider, that is,<br>
how to ensure that a security key corresponding to the mobile terminal is saved in<br>
subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal on the network side. If not<br>
properly solved, this problem may bring about a lot of trouble to the operation of the<br>
operator. For example, if the operator wants to get a security key of a mobile terminal<br>
after it is leased out and correspondingly save it to subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal on the network side, it is difficult to do so and it will<br>
bring about a lot of trouble to the operation of the operator due to the security of the<br>
security key and the difficulty of manual operation. Therefore, the seek for a feasible<br>
method of setting network locking function of a mobile terminal, i.e., a method of<br>
setting a security key corresponding to the leased mobile terminal in subscription<br>
data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal on the network side, is key to the<br>
development of terminal-lease service of an operator.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for setting a key,<br>
by means of which an operator need not manually set a security key corresponding<br>
to a mobile terminal in subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal on a<br>
network side when the mobile terminal is leased out, so that various mistakes and<br><br><br>
leakages due to manual operation may be reduced. Another embodiment of the<br>
invention provides a method for setting an initial security key, i.e., a first security key,<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The invention will now be described in detail in conjunction with the drawings<br>
and particular embodiments.<br>
In a method of setting a key according to an embodiment of the invention, in<br>
order to avoid manually setting a security key corresponding to a mobile terminal in<br>
subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal by an operator when the<br>
mobile terminal is leased out, a first security key may be preset in the mobile<br>
terminal before the mobile terminal is leased out, for example, a first security key<br>
may be preset in'the mobile terminal before the mobile terminal is shipped from a<br>
manufacturing factory. When the operator obtains the mobile terminal from a mobile<br>
terminal manufacturer, it may obtain a correlation table of the first security key of the<br>
mobile terminal and the identity of the mobile terminal. Alternatively, when an<br>
operator obtains a mobile terminal, a first security key is preset and the correlation<br>
table is obtained. The operator saves the correlation table in equipment associated<br>
with the network side. Therefore, the network side may obtain a first security key<br>
corresponding to a mobile terminal connected to the network from the correlation<br>
according to the identity of the mobile terminal, and obtain a second security key<br>
according to the first security key. Correspondingly, the mobile terminal obtains a<br>
second security key consistent with that of the network side according to a first<br>
security key saved therein. Therefore, a security key corresponding to the mobile<br>
terminal is set in subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal. For a<br>
CDMA system, the identity of the mobile terminal may be an electronic serial number<br>
(ESN) of a mobile terminal; for a WCDMA system, the identity may be an<br><br><br>
International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). However, this identity may also be a<br>
random identifier set by a subscriber or an operator. For the purpose of convenience,<br>
the identity of a mobile terminal herein is referred to as IMEI.<br>
In the flow chart according to an embodiment of the invention shown in Figure<br>
1, in step 101, a first security key is preset in a security module of a mobile terminal.<br>
For example, a SKey storage unit is arranged in the mobile terminal, and the first<br>
security key is saved in the SKey. While the key is set, the correlation between the<br>
identity of the mobile terminal IMEI and the first security key is obtained. For<br>
example, a storage unit for storing a security key is arranged in the security module<br>
of the mobile terminal. Before the mobile terminal is shipped from a manufacturing<br>
factory, a randomly generated first security key is preset in the storage unit by a<br>
mobile terminal manufacturer. Of course, the setting of the first security key may also<br>
be performed by an operator. While the mobile terminal manufacturer sets a first<br>
security key to each mobile terminal, a correlation table of the IMEI of the mobile<br>
terminal and the first security key is obtained.<br>
In step 102, equipment associated with a network side saves the correlation<br>
between the IMEI of the mobile terminal and the first security key. If the first security<br>
key of the mobile terminal is set by a mobile terminal manufacturer, then the mobile<br>
terminal manufacturer may obtain the correlation, and the operator may obtain the<br>
correlation table from the mobile terminal manufacturer. When the mobile terminal<br>
manufacturer provides a mobile terminal to an operator, it may also provide a<br>
correlation table of the IMEI of a mobile terminal and a first security key. The<br>
operator writes the table to associated equipment. The associated equipment may<br>
be a Home Location Register (HLR) or an authentication center (AUC), or a means<br>
which may be accessed by an HLR, for example, a terminal equipment information<br>
module MSI.<br>
In step 103, when a security key is set in subscription data of the subscriber of<br>
the mobile terminal, the equipment associated with the network side obtains a first<br>
security key corresponding to the mobile terminal according to the IMEI of the mobile<br><br><br>
terminal, and determines whether the first security key has been obtained. If the first<br>
security key has been obtained, then the equipment associated with the network<br>
side generates a second security key in step 104, and saves the second security key<br>
in subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal; otherwise, the process<br>
ends in step 105.<br>
In step 103, the step of obtaining the saved first security key corresponding to<br>
the mobile terminal by the network side may be performed as follows: the network<br>
side obtains a first security key from the correlation table of the IMEI of the mobile<br>
terminal and the first security key saved in step 102 according to the IMEI of the<br>
mobile terminal. The network side may obtain the IMEI of a mobile terminal in two<br>
ways: the IMEI of the mobile terminal is contained in a request message for an<br>
electronic key sent by the mobile terminal, and the network side may obtain a<br>
corresponding IMEI from the request message; or, the IMEI is saved in subscription<br>
data of a subscriber, and the network side retrieves a corresponding IMEI according<br>
to the lMSI.<br>
In step 103, the security key may be set in the subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal when the mobile subscriber completes the<br>
subscription procedure and the subscription data is written into associated<br>
equipment, for example, the subscription data of the subscriber is entered into HLR<br>
equipment of the subscriber; or when a batch process operation for setting a security<br>
key in subscription data is performed by associated equipment, for example, a batch<br>
process operation is performed after a batch of subscription data of subscribers are<br>
entered, as a result of which, respective security keys may be set in the batch of<br>
subscription data of subscribers; or when the mobile terminal logs on a network for<br>
the first time, for example, when the mobile terminal requests for an electronic key<br>
and it is determined that this is the first time for a mobile terminal to log on the<br>
network; or when a request associated with the mobile terminal is received, for<br>
example, the mobile terminal determines that it is used for the first time and then<br>
initiates a command for automatically synchronizing its security key.<br><br><br>
In step 104, the equipment associated with the network side generates a<br>
second security key, which may be directly the first security key or may be computed<br>
according to one or more of a random number, an authentication key Kl in<br>
subscription data, and the obtained first security key, etc. Correspondingly, the<br>
mobile terminal must generate and save a corresponding second security key, that<br>
is, the mobile terminal must compute and save a second security key according to<br>
one or more of a random number, a Kl in the subscriber card and the saved first<br>
security key, etc. Here, during the computation process of the second security key<br>
performed by the network side, when a Kl is used, a password key CK or an integrity<br>
key IK generated during the authentication may be used in place of the Kl to<br>
compute the second security key. Similarly, during the computation process of the<br>
second security key performed by the terminal side, when a Kl is used, a CK or an IK<br>
generated during the authentication may be used in place of the Kl to compute the<br>
second security key. The above computation may be digest computation. Of course,<br>
it may also be encryption-decryption computation, or any other computation. With<br>
respect to encryption-decryption computation or digest computation, reference is<br>
made to a book titled CRYPTOGRAPHY. in view of the security of a security key of a<br>
terminal, the process of writing a second security key by a mobile terminal is<br>
required to be performed in a controlled way(not freely). For example, when a<br>
second security key is written, an operation and maintenance password must be<br>
entered, or its validity must be verified by a security module. The following<br>
embodiment shows a process in which a mobile terminal writes a second security<br>
key through validity verification.<br>
In the process according to an embodiment of the present invention shown in<br>
Figure 2, in step 201, a first security key is preset in a security module of a mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
In step 202, the correlation between the IMEI of a mobile terminal and a first<br>
security key is saved in equipment associated with the network side.<br>
In step 203, when a security key is set in subscription data of the subscriber of<br><br><br>
the mobile terminal, the equipment associated with the network side obtains a first<br>
security key corresponding to the mobile terminal according to the IMEI of a mobile<br>
terminal, and determines whether the first security key has been obtained, if the first<br>
security key has been obtained, then the equipment associated with the network<br>
side generates an electronic key according to the first security key in step 204, and<br>
returns the electronic key to the mobile terminal, at the same time, generates a<br>
second security key and save the second security key in the subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal; otherwise, the process proceeds to step 205 in<br>
which a message "Operation Failed" is returned to the mobile terminal, and then the<br>
process ends in step 207.<br>
In step 206, after the mobile terminal obtains the electronic key, the security<br>
module determines the validity of the electronic key according to a first security key<br>
saved therein, and after it is determined that the electronic key is valid, the security<br>
module generates and saves a second security key.<br>
After step 206, the mobile terminal returns the determination result of the<br>
validity of the electronic key to the equipment associated with the network side. The<br>
equipment associated with the network side determines whether to save the second<br>
security key according to the determination result. If it is determined that the<br>
electronic key is valid, then the network side saves the second security key;<br>
otherwise, the network side does not save the second security key. For example, in<br>
step 204, the mobile terminal will not generate and save the second security key at<br>
first, instead, it determines whether to generate and save the second security key<br>
according to the determination result of the validity of the electronic key which is<br>
returned by the mobile terminal. Alternatively, it may set the second security key<br>
generated and saved at first as invalid, and then set the second security key as valid<br>
after it receives a message returned by the terminal indicating that the electronic key<br>
is valid.<br>
In the above method, if the mobile terminal determines in step 206 that the<br>
electronic key obtained from the network side is valid, then the first security key<br><br><br>
saved by the mobile terminal and the first security key saved by the network side<br>
according to IMEI are consistent with each other, and apparently, according to<br>
consistent computing methods, the second security keys obtained by the terminal<br>
and the network side respectively are consistent with each other too. if the electronic<br>
key obtained from the network side is invalid, then the first security key of the mobile<br>
terminal will not be modified, and the security key in the subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal on the network side will not be set. As a result, it<br>
cannot be ensured that the security key saved in the subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal on the network side and the first security key saved<br>
in the mobile terminal are consistent with each other.<br>
After the second security key is set in the subscription data of the subscriber<br>
of the mobile terminal on the network side and in the mobile terminal by means of the<br>
above method, when the mobile terminal logs on the network for the next time and<br>
obtains an electronic key from the network side, the network side will obtain a<br>
security key i.e., the second security key saved in step 204, from the subscription<br>
data of the subscriber according to the I MSI of the subscriber of the mobile terminal,<br>
and generate an electronic key using the security key and return the electronic key<br>
to the mobile terminal. When the mobile terminal obtains the electronic key, it<br>
determines the validity of the electronic key according to a second security key<br>
saved therein. If the electronic key is valid, then the mobile terminal is made to<br>
operate normally; otherwise, the mobile terminal is made to operate abnormally.<br>
Thus, network locking of a mobile terminal can be realized.<br>
In step 203, the security key may be set in the subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal, when a request associated with the mobile<br>
terminal is received, for example, when the mobile terminal determines that it is used<br>
for the first time and initiates a command for automatically synchronizing its security<br>
key; or when it is found that a subscriber logs on the network for the first time or a<br>
mobile terminal is used for the first time, so that the network locking function should<br>
be set, i.e., a security key should be set correspondingly in the mobile terminal and<br><br><br>
subscription data of a subscriber on the network side. Of course, it may also be the<br>
time when a command message received from the mobile terminal contains an<br>
indication flag of the mobile terminal indicating a security key should be set. Of<br>
course, it may also be the time when the network side initiates an update of a<br>
security key of the mobile terminal and carries information indicating that the security<br>
key should be updated in a message sent to the mobile terminal.<br>
In step 206, the mobile terminal may generate and save a second security<br>
key only when it is determined that the mobile terminal needs to set a security key.<br>
For example, when it is found that the mobile terminal is used for the first time, the<br>
network locking function should be set, that is, a security key should be set. Of<br>
course, it may also be the time when the command message received from the<br>
network contains an indication flag of the network indicating a security key should be<br>
set. Afirst-use flag may be set for detecting the first use of a mobile terminal. When it<br>
is used for the first time, this flag is set as 1. After that, it is set as 0. Therefore, it can<br>
be determined whether a mobile terminal is used for the first time according to<br>
whether the flag is 1.<br>
In step 204, the ways of obtaining an electronic key according to a first<br>
security key include, but are not limited to the following three ways:<br>
Firstly, when the mobile terminal sends a request for obtaining an electronic<br>
key to the network side, a random number msRand generated by the mobile<br>
terminal is carried in the request, and the network side obtains a computing result<br>
according to the msRand and the first security key, and takes the computing result<br>
as an electronic key to be returned to the mobile terminal. Correspondingly, in step<br>
206, a security module of the mobile terminal determines the validity of the electronic<br>
key according to a first security key saved therein as follows: it obtains a computing<br>
result according to its first security key and the msRand and determines whether the<br>
computing result is consistent with the electronic key returned by the network, for<br>
example, it determines whether they are the same as each other. If yes, then the<br>
electronic key is regarded as valid; otherwise, it is regarded as invalid.<br><br><br>
Secondly, the network side generates a controllable random number, obtains<br>
a computing result according to the controiiable random number and the first<br>
security key, and takes the computing result and the controllable random number<br>
together as an electronic key to be returned to the mobile terminal. Correspondingly,<br>
in step 206, a security module of the mobile terminal determines the validity of the<br>
electronic key according to a first security key saved therein as follows: it obtains a<br>
computing result according to its first security key and the obtained controllable<br>
random number RAND, and determines whether the computing result is consistent<br>
with that in the electronic key returned by the network, for example, it determines<br>
whether they are the same as each other. If not, then it regards the electronic key as<br>
invalid; otherwise, it further determines whether the controllable random number<br>
RAND is valid, that is, it determines whether the random number is a real<br>
controllable random number, or whether the random number is controlled. If yes,<br>
then it regards the electronic key as valid; otherwise, the network may be requested<br>
to synchronistically regenerate a reference number of a controllable random number<br>
and to regenerate a controllable random number, and to regenerate an electronic<br>
key via the controllable random number and the first security key. With respect to a<br>
nullable random number, a reference number and a method of determining whether<br>
a random number is controllable, reference is made to Chinese Patent Application<br>
No. 200410078038.7, titled "A METHOD OF AUTHENTICATION", and they will not<br>
be described in detail here.<br>
Thirdly, the network side generates a random number RAND, obtains a<br>
computing result according to a pre-saved serial number SQN, the RAND and a first<br>
security key, and takes the SQN, the RAND and the computing result together as an<br>
electronic key to be returned to the mobile terminal. Correspondingly, in step 206, a<br>
security module of the mobile terminal determines the validity of the electronic key<br>
according to a first security key saved therein as follows: it obtains a computing<br>
result according to the obtained SQN, RAND and its first security key and<br>
determines whether the computing result is consistent with that in the electronic key<br><br><br>
returned by the network, for example, it determines whether they are the same as<br>
each other, if not, then it regards the electronic key as invalid; otherwise, it further<br>
determines whether the SQN is acceptable. If yes, then it regards the electronic key<br>
as valid; if not, then the network may be requested to resynchronize the SQN and<br>
regenerate an electronic key. With respect to the setting of an SQN, the method of<br>
determining whether an SQN is acceptable and the method of synchronizing an<br>
SQN, reference may be made to the related protocol specification of 3GPP<br>
33.102/29.002, and they will not be described in detail here.<br>
As discussed above, in step 204, an electronic key may also be generated<br>
according to the first security key as follows: the electronic key is obtained according<br>
to the computation and/or combination of one or more of a random number, a Kl in<br>
subscription data and the obtained corresponding first security key, etc. in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the electronic key is computed according to a Rand, a first<br>
security key and a Kl. Here, the random number may be generated by the network<br>
side, for example, it may be a controllable random number generated by the network,<br>
or it may be a random number and a serial number generated by the network; or it<br>
may be generated by a mobile terminal and sent to the network. If the random<br>
number is generated by the network side and a random number and/or a serial<br>
number is used when computing the electronic key, then the electronic key should<br>
contain the random number and the serial number. Similarly, different processes for<br>
generating random numbers and electronic keys may be employed for different<br>
authentication modes, and they will not be described again here. Correspondingly, in<br>
step 206, a security module of the terminal determines the validity of the electronic<br>
key according to a first security key saved therein as follows: it also obtains a<br>
computing result according to one or more of a random number, a Kl in subscription<br>
data and the saved corresponding first security key, etc., and determines the validity<br>
of the electronic key by comparing the computing result with that in the obtained<br>
electronic key. If they are consistent with each other, for example, if they are the<br>
same as each other, then the electronic key is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.<br><br><br>
In step 202, the network side may save the correlation between the identity of<br>
the mobile terminal IMEI and the first security key in an HLR or in a terminal<br>
equipment information module MSI. If the correlation is saved in a terminal<br>
equipment information module MSI, in step 203, when a security key is set in<br>
subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal, network equipment, such<br>
as an HLR, may obtain the corresponding first security key from the MSI according<br>
to the IMEI of the mobile terminal. When an MSI cannot obtain the corresponding<br>
first security key, a message indicating the failure of the obtaining of the first security<br>
key is sent to the HLR. Therefore, the HLR may know whether the first security key<br>
can be obtained. Of course, the MSI may directly generate an electronic key<br>
according to the first security key. As a result, the HLR may obtain an electronic key<br>
directly from the MSI and return the electronic key to the terminal. Similarly, a second<br>
security key can also be generated by the MSI. When a Kl or a CK or an IK or a<br>
random number RAND is needed for computing the second security key, the HLR<br>
needs to transmit the information to the MSI.<br>
In step 204, the network equipment may save the second security key by<br>
setting a SKey field in subscription data of the subscriber of the mobile terminal and<br>
saving the value of the second security key to the SKey in the subscription data of<br>
the subscriber. Alternatively, the second security key may be saved in another table<br>
or equipment, for example, in the MSI, according to the IMSI.<br>
In step 204, the network side HLR may generate a second security key by<br>
computing according to one or more of a random number, an authentication key Kl in<br>
subscription data and a corresponding first security key, etc. Correspondingly, in<br>
step 206, the terminal may also generate a second security key by computing<br>
according to one or more of a random number, a Kl in the subscriber card and a<br>
SKey value, etc. Of course, during the process of computing the second security key<br>
by the network side, when a Kl is used, the CK or IK generated during authentication<br>
may be used in place of the Kl to generate the second security key. Correspondingly,<br>
in step 206, during the process of computing the second security key by the terminal<br><br><br>
side, when a Kl is used, the CK or IK generated during authentication may be used<br>
in place of the Kl to generate the second security key.<br>
By means of the above method, after a corresponding second security key is<br>
set in a mobile terminal and in the SKey in subscription data of the subscriber of the<br>
mobile terminal, that is, after the network locking function is set, if the subscriber<br>
card of the mobile terminal is replaced, the equipment associated with the network<br>
side cannot obtain a security key value corresponding to the SKey value set in the<br>
mobile terminal from subscription data corresponding to the new subscriber card.<br>
Thus, after the mobile terminal accesses a network, it cannot obtain a valid<br>
electronic key from the network, so that the mobile terminal cannot operate normally.<br>
As a result, "cross-network use" and "cross-region use" of a mobile terminal may be<br>
prevented.<br>
A subscriber may obtain the authentication key Kl of his/her subscriber card<br>
by a physical measure. However, he/she may not know the old security key, i.e., the<br>
first security key preset in the mobile terminal. Thus, by means of a second security<br>
key generated according to the first security key, a person who gets a lost mobile<br>
terminal may be prevented to change the program of the mobile terminal<br>
immediately and intercept the Rand so as to obtain a second security key computed<br>
from only the Kl and the Rand. In a preferred embodiment, if the second security key<br>
is computed according to the first security key, the KI and the Rand together, then a<br>
subscriber may not know the second security key unless he/she gets the first<br>
security key. Because the subscriber does not know the second security key, he/she<br>
cannot synchronize the SKey value in his/her subscription data from an operator.<br>
For example, after the subscriber gets the second security key, he/she may request<br>
an operator to change the SKey in his/her subscription data in an HLR to the value of<br>
a second security key, so that he/she may illegally use the mobile terminal. The<br>
reason why a Rand and a Kl are used in the computation lies in that: for a valid<br>
subscriber, even if the first security key of his/her mobile terminal is leaked by the<br>
manufacturer of the mobile terminal, because the newly generated security key, i.e.,<br><br><br>
*the second security key is computed according to the Rand and Kl, a person who<br>
illegally gets the mobile terminal cannot know the corresponding Kl or Rand, and<br>
thus cannot know the newly generated second security key. The Rand may ensure<br>
the variability of the generated second security key, that is, the terminal and the<br>
network side may use a new RAND to generate a second security key at any<br>
moment, and update the SKey value corresponding to the terminal and the network<br>
with the second security key. Correspondingly, the Kl may ensure the security of the<br>
generated second security key.<br>
In the above embodiment, the equipment associated with the network side in<br>
step 203 may be an HLR.<br>
In the process according to an embodiment of the present invention shown in<br>
Figure 3, the correlation between the IMEI of the mobile terminal and the first<br>
security key is saved in a terminal equipment information module MSI.<br>
In step 301, a first security key is set in a mobile terminal. In this embodiment,<br>
it is described by taking the example that a SKey storage unit is arranged in the<br>
mobile terminal and the first security key is saved in the SKey.<br>
In step 302, a terminal equipment information module MSI is arranged on a<br>
network side, and the correlation between the IMEI of the mobile terminal and the<br>
first security key is saved in the MSI.<br>
In step 303, after the mobile terminal accesses the network, it requests an<br>
electronic key from the HLR on the network side.<br>
In step 304, the HLR obtains the IMEI information of the mobile terminal. For<br>
example, the corresponding IMEI information of a mobile terminal may be saved in<br>
subscription data of a subscriber, thus, the HLR may obtain the IMEI information<br>
from the corresponding subscription data; the IMEI information may also be carried<br>
in a request command of a mobile terminal, and the HLR resolves the corresponding<br>
IMEI information from the request command; or the correlation between IMSI and<br>
IMEI may be saved in another module in which information can be obtained by the<br><br><br>
HLR, and the HLR obtains the corresponding IMEI information by sending request<br>
information to the module according to the IMSl.<br>
In step 305, the HLR requests the corresponding first security key from the<br>
MSI according to the IMEI information.<br>
In step 306, the MSI retrieves the corresponding first security key in a<br>
correlation table of the IMEI and the first security key according to the IMEI<br>
information provided by the HLR, and returns the first security key to the HLR.<br>
In step 307, the HLR generates an electronic key according to the first<br>
security key, and generates a second security key while returning the electronic key<br>
to the mobile terminal, and saves the second security key in subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal.<br>
In step 308, after the mobile terminal obtains the electronic key, a security<br>
module determines the validity of the electronic key according to its first security key.<br>
If the electronic key is valid, then in step 309, the security module generates a<br>
second security key, and saves the second security key, for example, the second<br>
security key may be saved in the SKey for determining the validity of an electronic<br>
key delivered by the network for the next time; if the electronic key is not valid, then<br>
the process proceeds to step 310 directly and ends.<br>
In step 309, after the mobile terminal successfully sets the value of the<br>
security key, that is, after the mobile terminal saves the second security key, it may<br>
returns a command indicating the success of the setting to the HLR, then the HLR<br>
may determine whether to generate and save a second security key according to the<br>
returned command. At this point, the HLR may not generate and save a second<br>
security key at first, or it may set the second security key generated and saved at<br>
first as invalid, and then set the second security key as valid after a command<br>
indicating the success of the setting returned by the terminal is received.<br>
The HLR may send a message to the MSI indicating that the security key has<br>
been set successfully by the terminal, in which the IMSl of the terminal subscriber<br><br><br>
may be carried. The MSI records the IMSI of the subscriber of the mobile terminal for<br>
determining the subscriber of the mobile terminal.<br>
In step 302, the corresponding zone information may be further saved<br>
according to the IMEI. The zone information may be the zone value of the IMSI<br>
number of the subscriber card, or it may be the zone value of the directory number of<br>
the mobile subscriber. For example, the zone value may correspond to a city area<br>
code or HLR code respectively. Thus, in step 305, when the HLR requests the<br>
corresponding first security key according to the IMEI information, it may further<br>
send the corresponding IMSI information or the directory number information of the<br>
mobile subscriber to the MSI. Correspondingly, in step 306, before the MSI returns<br>
the first security key to the HLR, the MSI may obtain the corresponding zone value<br>
according to the IMEI, and determine whether the obtained zone value is consistent<br>
with the IMSI or the directory number information of the mobile subscriber<br>
transmitted by the HLR. If they are consistent with each other, then the MSI sends<br>
the first security key to the HLR; otherwise, it returns a message "Failed To Request<br>
The First Security Key" to the HLR or a message "Unauthorized To Obtain The First<br>
Security Key" to the HLR. Of course, if the corresponding zone information is further<br>
saved according to the IMEI in step 302, then in step 305, when the HLR requests<br>
the corresponding first security key from the MSI according to the IMEI information,<br>
the corresponding IMSI information or the directory number information of the<br>
mobile subscriber may not be sent to the MSI. In such a case, in step 306, when the<br>
MSI returns the first security key to the HLR, the MSI may further obtain the<br>
corresponding zone value according to the IMEI and return the obtained zone value<br>
and the first security key together to the HLR, and the HLR determines whether the<br>
zone value returned by the MSI is consistent with the IMSI of the subscriber of the<br>
mobile terminal or the directory number information of the mobile subscriber. If they<br>
are consistent with each other, then the HLR determines that the first security key<br>
has been obtained successfully; otherwise, the HLR determines that it has failed to<br>
obtain the first security key.<br><br><br>
In step 302, the corresponding IMSl information or the directory number<br>
information of the mobile subscriber may be further saved according to the IMEI.<br>
Thus, in step 305, when the HLR requests the corresponding first security key from<br>
the MSI according to the IMEI information, the corresponding IMSl information or the<br>
directory number information of the mobile subscriber may be further sent to the MSI.<br>
Correspondingly, in step 306, before the MSI returns the first security key to the HLR,<br>
the MSI may obtain the corresponding IMSl information or the directory number<br>
information of the mobile subscriber according to the IMEI, and determine whether<br>
the obtained IMSl information or directory number information of the mobile<br>
subscriber contains the IMSl information or the directory number information of the<br>
mobile subscriber transmitted by the HLR. If yes, then the MSI sends the first<br>
security key to the HLR; otherwise, it returns a message "Failed To Request The<br>
First Security Key" to the HLR, or a message "Unauthorized to obtain the first<br>
security key" to the HLR. Of course, if the corresponding zone information is further<br>
saved according to the IMEI in step 302, then in step 305, when the HLR requests<br>
the corresponding first security key from the MSI according to the IMEI information,<br>
the corresponding IMSl information or the directory number information of the<br>
mobile subscriber may not be sent to the MSI. In such a case, in step 306, when the<br>
MSI returns the first security key to the HLR, the MSI may obtain the corresponding<br>
IMSl information or directory number information of the mobile subscriber according<br>
to the IMEI and return the obtained IMSl information or directory number<br>
information of the mobile subscriber and the first security key together to the HLR,<br>
and the HLR determines whether the IMSl information or the directory number<br>
information of the mobile subscriber returned by the MSI is consistent with the IMSl<br>
of the subscriber of the mobile terminal or the directory number information of the<br>
mobile subscriber. If they are consistent with each other, then the HLR determines<br>
that the first security key has been obtained successfully; otherwise, the HLR<br>
determines that it has failed to obtain the first security key.<br>
In step 307, the HLR saves the second security key. That is, a SKey is further<br><br><br>
set in subscription data of the subscriber, and the HLR saves the second security<br>
key by setting the value of SKey with the second security key. That is, the value of<br>
SKey is set to the second security key.<br>
step 307 may further include: transmitting the generated second security key<br>
to the MSI, and saving the second security key in the MSI, so that the MSI may<br>
transmitting the second security key to the HLR as the first security key when the<br>
HLR requests the corresponding first security key according to the IMEI for the next<br>
time.<br>
In step 307, the network side may generate a second security key by directly<br>
taking the first security key as the second security key. Correspondingly, in step 308,<br>
the terminal will not generate a second security key or it will not perform the<br>
operation in step 308.<br>
In step 307, the HLR on the network side may generate a second security key<br>
by computing according to one or more of a random number, a Kl in subscription<br>
data and the corresponding first security key, etc. Correspondingly, in step 309, the<br>
terminal may generate a second security key by computing according to one or more<br>
of a random number, a Kl in the subscriber card and the set SKey value, etc. Of<br>
course, during the computation of the second security key by the network side, when<br>
a Kl is used, a CK or an IK generated during authentication may also be used in<br>
place of the Kl to compute the second security key. Correspondingly, in step 309,<br>
during the computation of the second security key by the terminal side, when a Kl is<br>
used, a CK or an IK generated during authentication may also be used in place of<br>
the Kl to compute the second security key.<br>
In another method of setting a key according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention, a first security key is preset in a security module of a mobile terminal. For<br>
example, a SKey storage unit is arranged in the mobile terminal, and the first<br>
security key is saved in the SKey. The correlation between the IMSI of the subscriber<br>
card of the mobile terminal and the first security key is saved in equipment<br>
associated with the network side. When a security key is set in subscription data of<br><br><br>
the subscriber of the mobile terminal, the equipment associated with the network<br>
side obtains a first security key corresponding to the mobile terminal according to the<br>
IMSI of the subscriber card of the mobile terminal, and determines whether the first<br>
security key has been obtained. If the first security key has been obtained, then the<br>
equipment associated with the network side generates a second security key and<br>
saves the second security key in the subscription data of the subscriber of the<br>
mobile terminal; otherwise, the process ends.<br>
In the process according to an embodiment of the present invention shown in<br>
Figure 4, the correlation between the IMSI of the subscriber card of the mobile<br>
terminal and the first security key is saved in a terminal equipment information<br>
module MSI. The HLR requests the corresponding first security key from the MSI<br>
according to the IMSI of the subscriber card of the mobile terminal.<br>
In step 401, a first security key is set in a mobile terminal. For example, a<br>
SKey storage unit is arranged in the mobile terminal, and the first security key is<br>
saved in the SKey.<br>
In step 402, a terminal equipment information module MSI is arranged on the<br>
network side, and the correlation between the IMSI of the subscriber card of the<br>
mobile terminal and the first security key is saved in the MSI.<br>
In step 403, after the mobile terminal accesses the network, it requests an<br>
electronic key from the HLR on the network side.<br>
In step 404, the HLR obtains the IMSI information of the subscriber card of<br>
the mobile terminal.<br>
In step 405, the HLR requests the corresponding first security key from the<br>
MSI according to the IMSI information.<br>
In step 406, the MSI retrieves the corresponding first security key in the<br>
correlation table according to the IMSI information provided by the HLR, and returns<br>
the first security key to the HLR.<br>
In step 407, the HLR generates an electronic key according to the first<br><br><br>
security key, and generates a second security key while returning the electronic key<br>
to the mobile terminal, and saves the second security key in subscription data of the<br>
subscriber of the mobile terminal.<br>
in step 408, after the mobile terminal obtains an electronic key, a security<br>
module determines the validity of the electronic key according to its SKey value. If<br>
the electronic key is valid, then in step 409, the mobile terminal generates a second<br>
security key and saves the second security key, for example, in the SKey for<br>
determining the validity of the electronic key delivered by the network for the next<br>
time; otherwise, the process ends in step 410.<br>
In step 406, if the MSI does not obtain the corresponding first security key,<br>
then the MSI returns a message "Failed To Obtain The First Security Key" to the<br>
HLR. At this point, step 407 and the subsequent steps will not be executed.<br>
In step 402, the correlation between the IMSI of the subscriber card of the<br>
mobile terminal and the identity of the mobile terminal IMEI may be further saved.<br>
Correspondingly, in step 404, the HLR further obtains the IMEI information of the<br>
«<br>
mobile terminal. In step 405, when the HLR requests the first security key, the IMEI<br>
information of the mobile terminal will be sent to the MSI. In step 406, the MSI<br>
obtains the corresponding first security key according to the IMSI and IMEI<br>
information provided by the HLR, and returns the obtained first security key to the<br>
HLR.<br>
Of course, when the correlation between the IMSI of the subscriber card of<br>
the mobile terminal and the identity of the mobile terminal IMEI is saved in step 402,<br>
the HLR may also further obtain the IMEI information of the mobile terminal in step<br>
404. Correspondingly, in step 406, when the MSI obtains the first security key<br>
according to the IMSI, it may obtain the IMEI information of the mobile terminal at the<br>
same time and return the obtained IMEI information of the mobile terminal and the<br>
first security key together to the HLR. Before step 407, the HLR further determines<br>
whether the IMEI information returned by the MSI is consistent with the IMEI<br>
information obtained in step 404. If they are consistent with each other, then the HLR<br><br><br>
performs step 407 and the subsequent operations; otherwise, the HLR does not<br>
perform step 407 and the subsequent operations.<br>
According to the above method, when an operator leases out a mobile<br>
terminal and opens an account, the IMEI of the mobile terminal and the<br>
corresponding IMSl of the subscriber card will be saved in the MSI. Thus, the MSI or<br>
HLR may determine whether the subscriber card corresponding to the IMSl may use<br>
the mobile terminal corresponding to the IMEI so as to determine whether a valid<br>
electronic key should be returned to the mobile terminal, so that the mobile terminal<br>
may automatically update its security key according to the electronic key, for<br>
example, the mobile terminal may automatically update the first security key.<br>
Therefore, network locking function may be performed on the leased terminal.<br>
In the above fourth embodiment, the directory number of the mobile<br>
subscriber may be used to replace the IMSl of the subscriber card of the mobile<br>
terminal. This will not be described in detail here. <br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the mobile terminal may generate a<br>
second security key via a security module, or a program of the mobile terminal<br>
and/or the subscriber card, or a combination thereof. For example, the second<br>
security key may be generated as follows: a first computing result is obtained in the<br>
subscriber card according to a random number and a Kl in the subscriber card, and<br>
it is returned to a program of the mobile terminal; the program obtains a second<br>
computing result according to the first computing result, and returns the second<br>
computing result to a security module; and the security module obtains a second<br>
security key according to the SKey saved therein and the second computing result.<br>
The computation may be digest computation or encryption-decryption computation.<br>
The security module may be a physical module, or a logical module, or even a<br>
function.<br>
When a mobile terminal according to the embodiment determines that an<br>
electronic key is invalid, the mobile terminal will not set the security key, and will<br>
continue to attempt to obtain an electronic key until a valid electronic key is obtained,<br><br><br>
or when the number of unsuccessful attempts reaches a certain value, such as 10,<br>
the mobile terminal will stop attempting. Of course, an operation and maintenance<br>
password Pswd may be further set in the security module. This operation and<br>
maintenance password may be used to cancel network locking function and to set a<br>
security key. When the mobile terminal cannot obtain a correct electronic key, the<br>
subscriber may correctly input the password so as to make the mobile terminal<br>
operate normally. When a security module in the mobile terminal cannot correctly<br>
obtain an electronic key, the subscriber may be prompted to input the operation and<br>
maintenance password via an interface. After the subscriber inputs a correct<br>
operation and maintenance password', network locking function will be cancelled or<br>
a security key will be set. Or, after a subscriber wrongly inputs the operation and<br>
maintenance password for certain times, such as 10, the subscriber will be<br>
prohibited to input the password or there will be no response when a password is<br>
input.<br>
An embodiment of the invention further provides a method of setting an initial<br>
security key to a SKEY storage unit of a mobile terminal, which includes:<br>
In step 1001, writing equipment generates a temporary security key tmpSKey,<br>
and transmits it to the mobile terminal;<br>
In step 1002, after the mobile terminal obtains the tmpSKey, it transmits the<br>
tmpSKey to a security module;<br>
In step 1003, the security module determines whether the value of its SKey is<br>
null:<br>
If the value is null, then in step 1004, the security module saves the tmpSKey<br>
to the SKey and returns a message "The tmpSKey Has Been Written Successfully"<br>
to the mobile terminal, and in step 1005, the mobile terminal obtains its IMEl and<br>
returns the IMEl to the writing equipment, and in step 1006, the writing equipment<br>
saves the correlation between the returned IMEl of the mobile terminal and the<br>
tmpSKey;<br><br><br>
If the value is not null, then in step 1007, the security module returns a<br>
message "Failed To Write The tmpSKey" to the mobile terminal, and in step 1008,<br>
the mobile terminal returns a message "Failed To Write the tmpSKey" to the writing<br>
equipment.<br>
Here, when the value of the SKey is null, it means that the value of the SKey<br>
is 0 or a certain value, such as a 128-bit binary number with all the bits "1".<br>
In step 1008, when the mobile terminal has failed to write the tmpSKey in the<br>
security module, it may also obtain the IMEI of the mobile terminal and return the<br>
IMEI to the writing equipment. In step 1005 and step 1008, the mobile terminal may<br>
distinguish whether the tmpSKey has been written successfully by carrying a<br>
success or failure flag in a command returned to the writing equipment.<br>
By means of the above method of setting a security key to a SKey storage<br>
unit in a mobile terminal, when a mobile terminal is produced by a mobile terminal<br>
manufacturer, a SKey storage unit in a security module may be preset to null and<br>
then be packaged. After the storage unit is packaged, it can only be accessed via an<br>
access interface of the security module. According to the above method, after the<br>
storage unit is packaged, a tmpSKey may be written to the security module of the<br>
mobile terminal via a serial port of the mobile terminal through the writing equipment.<br>
Of course, an initial flag iFlag may also be set in the security module, and in<br>
step 1003, it is not determined whether the value of the SKey is null, instead, it is<br>
determined whether the value of the initial flag iFlag is 1. If the value of the iFlag is 1,<br>
then in step 1004, the tmpSKey is saved to the SKey and a message "The tmpSKey<br>
Has been Written Successfully" is returned to the mobile terminal. In step 1005, the<br>
mobile terminal obtains its IMEI and returns the IMEI to the writing equipment. In<br>
step 1006, the writing equipment saves the correlation between the returned IMEI of<br>
the mobile terminal and the tmpSKey;<br>
If the value of the iFlag is 0, then return a message "Failed To Write the<br>
tmpSKey" to the mobile terminal in step 1007, and in step 1008, the mobile terminal<br>
returns a message "Failed To Write the tmpSKey" to the writing equipment.<br><br><br>
The method of setting an operation and maintenance password Pswd to a<br>
mobile terminal and the method of setting a super-password SPswd to a mobile<br>
terminal, or the prompt words are similar to those in the above method of setting the<br>
value of a SKey, and thus they will not be described again here.<br>
It should be understood that the above description is only preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, and should not be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
Various modifications, substitution and improvements etc. made without departing<br>
from the spirit and principle of the invention are intended to be encompassed in the<br>
scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
