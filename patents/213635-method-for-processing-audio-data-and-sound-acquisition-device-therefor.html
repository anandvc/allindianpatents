				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>	The present invention relates to the processing of<br>
5	audio data.<br>
	Techniques pertaining to the propagation of a sound<br>
	wave in three-dimensional apace, involving in<br>
	particular specialized sound simulation and/or<br>
10	playback, implement audio signal processing methods<br>
	applied to the simulation of acoustic and<br>
	psycho- acoustic phenomena. Such processing methods<br>
	provide for a spatial encoding of the acoustic field,<br>
	its transmission and its spatialized reproduction on a<br>
15	set of loudspeakers or on headphones of a stereophonic<br>
	headset.<br>
	Among the techniques of spatialised sound are<br>
	distinguished two categories of processing that are<br>
20 	mutually complementary but which are both generally<br>
	implemented within one and the same system.<br>
	On the one hand, a first category of processing relates<br>
	to methods for synthesizing a room effect, or more<br>
25	generally surrounding effects. From a description of<br>
	one or more sound sources (signal emitted, position,<br>
	orientation, directivity, or the like) and based on a<br>
	room effect model {involving 3 room geometry, or else a<br>
	desired acoustic perception), one calculates and<br>
30	describes a set of elementary acoustic phenomena<br>
	(Direct, reflected or diffracted waves), or else a<br>
	macroscopic acoustic phenomenon (reverberated and<br>
	diffuse field), making it possible to convey the<br>
	spatial effect at the level of a listener situated at a<br>
35	chosen point of auditory perception, in three-<br>
	dimensional space. One then calculates a set of signals<br>
	typically associated with the reflections {"secondary"<br>
	sources, active through re-emission of a main wave<br><br>
- 2-<br>
	received, having a spatial position attribute} and/or<br>
	associated with a late reverberation (decorrelated<br>
	signals for a diffuse field).<br>
5	On the other hand/ a second category of methods relates<br>
	to the positional or directional rendition ot sound<br>
	sources. These methods are applied to signals<br>
	determined by a method of the first category described<br>
	above (involving primary and secondary sources) as a<br>
10	function of the spatial description (position of the<br>
	source) which is associated with them. In particular,<br>
	such methods according to this second category make it<br>
	possible to obtain signals to be disseminated on<br>
	loudspeakers or headphones, so as ultimately to give a.<br>
15	listener the auditory impression of sound sources<br>
	stationed at predetermined respective positions around<br>
	the listener. The methods according to this second<br>
	category are dubbed "creators of three-dimensional<br>
	sound images"t on account of the distribution in three-<br>
20	dimensional space of the awareness of the position of<br>
	the sources by a listener. Methods according to the<br>
	second category generally comprise a first step of<br>
	spatial encoding of the elementary acoustic events<br>
	which produces a representation of the sound field in<br>
25	three-dimensional space. In a second step, this<br>
	representation is transmitted or stored for subsequent<br>
	use. In a third step, of decoding, the decoded signals<br>
	are delivered on loudspeakers or headphones of a<br>
	playback device,<br>
30<br>
	The present invention is encompassed rather within the<br>
	second aforesaid category. It relates in particular to<br>
	the spatial encoding of sound sources and a<br>
	specification of the three-dimensional sound<br>
35	representation of these sources. It applies equally<br>
	well to an encoding of "virtual" sound sources<br>
	(applications where sound sources are simulated such as<br>
	games, a spatialized conference, or the like), as to an<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	"acoustic" encoding of a natural sound field, during<br>
	sound capture by one or more tnree-dimensional arrays<br>
	of microphones,<br>
5	Among the conceivable techniques of sound<br>
	spatialisation, the "asibisonic" approach is preferred.<br>
	Ambisonic encoding, which will be described in detail<br>
	further on, consists in representing signals pertaining<br>
	to one or more sound waves in a base of spherical<br>
10	harmonics (in spherical coordinates involving in<br>
	particular an angle of elevation and an azimuthal<br>
	angle, characterizing a direction of the sound ot<br>
	sounds). The components representing these signals and<br>
	expressed in this base of spherical harmonics are also<br>
15	dependent, in respect of the waves emitted in the near<br>
	field/ on a distance between the sound source emitting<br>
	this field and a point corresponding to the origin of<br>
	the base of spherical harmonics. More particularly,<br>
	this dependence on the distance is expressed as a<br>
20	function of the sound frequency, as will be seen<br>
	further on.<br>
	This ambisonic approach offers a large number of<br>
	possible functionalities, in particular in terms of<br>
25	simulataion of virtual sources, and, in a general<br>
	manner, exhibits the following advantages:<br>
	-	it conveys, in a rational manner, the reality of<br>
	the acoustic phenomena and affords realistic,<br>
	convincing and immersive spatial auditory rendition-<br>
30	-	the representation of the acoustic phenomena is<br>
	scalable: it offers a spatial resolution which may be<br>
	adapted to various situations. Specifically, this<br>
	representation may be transmitted and utilized as a<br>
	function of throughput constraints during the<br>
35	transmission of the encoded signals and/or of<br>
	limitations of the playback device;<br>
		the ambisonic representation is flexible and it is<br>
	possible to simulate a rotation of the sound field, or<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	else, on playback, to adapt the decoding of the<br>
	atnbisonic signals to any playback device, of diverse<br>
	geomatries.<br>
5	In the known ambisonic approach, the encoding of the<br>
	virtual sources is essentially directional. The<br>
	encoding functions amount to calculating gains which<br>
	depend on the incidence of the sound wave expressed by<br>
	the spherical harmonic functions which depend on the<br>
10	angle of elevation and the azimuthal angle in spherical<br>
	coordinates - In particular, on decoding, it. is assumed<br>
	that the loudspeakers , on playback, are far removed.<br>
	This results in a distortion (or a curving) of the<br>
	shape of the reconstructed wavefronts. Specifically, as<br>
15	indicated hereinabove, the components of the sound<br>
	signal in the base of spherical harmonics, for a near<br>
	field, in fact depart also on the distance of the<br>
	source and the sound frequency. More precisely, these<br>
	components may be expressed mathematically in the form<br>
20	of a polynomial whose variable is inversely<br>
	proportional to the aforesaid distance and to the sound<br>
	frequency. Thus, the ambisonic components, in the sense<br>
	of their theoretical expression, are diveigent in the<br>
	low frequencies and, in particular, tend to infinity<br>
25	when the sound frequency decreases to zero, when they<br>
	represent a near field sound emitted by a source<br>
	situated at a finite distance. This mathematical<br>
	phenomenon is known, in the realm of ambisonic<br>
	representation, already for order 1, by the term<br>
30 	"bass boost", in particular through:<br>
	-	M.A. GERZOH, "General Meta theory of Auditory<br>
	Localisation", preprint 3306 of the 92nd AES Convention,<br>
	1992, page 52.<br>
This phenomenon becomes particularly critical for high<br>
35	spherical harmonic orders involving polynomials or high<br>
	power.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
The following document:<br>
	SONTACCH1 and HOLDRICH, "further Investigations on 3D<br>
	Sound Fields using Distance Coding" (Proceedings of the<br>
	 COST G-6 Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFX-01),<br>
5	 Limerick, Ireland, 6-8 December 2001),<br>
	discloses a technique for taking account; of a curving<br>
	of the wavefronts within a near representation of an<br>
	ambisonic representation, the principle of which<br>
	consists in:<br>
10	-	applying an ambisonic encoding {of high order) to<br>
	the signals arising from a (simulated) virtuai sound<br>
	capture; of WFS type (standing for "Wave Field<br>
	Synthesis') ,<br>
	-	and reconstructing the acoustic field over a zone<br>
15	according to its values over a zone boundary, thus<br>
	 based on the HUYGENS-FRESNEL principle.<br>
	However, the technique presented in this document,<br>
	although promising on account of the fact that it uses<br>
20	an ambisonic representation to a high order, poses a<br>
	 certain number of problems:<br>
	-	the computer resources required for the<br>
	calculation of all the surfaces making it possible to<br>
	apply the HUYGENS-FRBSNEL principle, as well as the<br>
25	 calculation times required, are excessive;<br>
	-	processing artifacts referred to as "spatial<br>
	aliasing" appear on account of the distance between the<br>
	microphones, unless a tightly spaced virtual microphone<br>
	grid is chosen, thereby making the processing more<br>
30 cumbersome;<br>
	-	this technique is difficult to transpose over to a<br>
	real case of sensors to be disposed in an array, in the<br>
	presence of a teal source, upon acquisition;<br>
	-	on playback, the three-dimensional sound<br>
35	 representation is implicitly bound to a fixed radius of<br>
	 the playback device since the ambisonic decoding must<br>
	be done, here, on an array of loudspeakers of the same<br>
	dimensions as the initial array of microphones, this<br><br>
-  6  -<br>
	document proposing no means of adapting the encoding or<br>
	the decoding to other sizes of playback devices.<br>
	 Above all, this document presents a horizontal array of<br>
5	sensors, thereby assuming that the acoustic phenomena<br>
	in question, here, propagate only in horizontal<br>
	directions, thereby excluding any other direction of<br>
	propagation and thus not representing the physical<br>
	reality of an ordinary acoustic field.<br>
10<br>
	More generally, current techniques do not make it<br>
	possible to satisfactorily process any type of sound<br>
	source, in particular a near field source, taut rather<br>
	far removed sound sources (plane waves), this<br>
15	corresponding to a restrictive and artificial situation<br>
	in numerous applications.<br>
	An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
	method for processing, by encoding, transmission and<br>
20	playback, any type of sound field, in particular the<br>
	effect of a sound source in the near field.<br>
	Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
	method allowing the encoding of virtual sources, not<br>
25	only direction-wise, but also distance-wise, and to<br>
	define a decoding adaptable to any playback device.<br>
	Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
	robust method of processing the sounds of any sound<br>
30	frequencies (including low frequencies) , in particular<br>
	for the sound capture of natural acoustic fields with<br>
	the aid of three-dimensional arrays of microphones.<br>
	To this end, the present invention proposes a method of<br>
35	 processing sound data, in which:<br>
	a signals representative of at least one sound<br>
	propagating in a three-dimensional space and arising<br>
	from a source situated at a first distance from a<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	reference point are coded so as to obtain a<br>
	representation of the sound by components expressed in<br>
	a base of spherical harmonics, of origin corresponding<br>
	to said reference point, and<br>
5	b) a compensation of a near field effect is applied<br>
	to said components by a filtering which is dependent on<br>
	a second distance defining substantially, fox a<br>
	playback of the sound by a playback device, a distance<br>
	between a playback point and a point of auditory<br>
10 	perception.<br>
	In a first embodiment, said source being far removed<br>
	from the reference point,<br>
	-	components of successive orders m are obtained for<br>
15	the representation of the sound in said base of<br>
	spherical harmonics, and<br>
	-	a filter is applied, the coefficients of which,<br>
	each applied to a component of order an, are expressed<br>
	analytically in the form of the inverse of a polynomial<br>
20	of power in, whose variable is inversely proportional to <br>
	the sound frequency and to said second distance, so as<br>
	to compensate for a near field effect at the level of<br>
	the playback device.<br>
25	In a second embodiment, said source being a virtual<br>
	source envisaged. at said first distance,<br>
	-	components of successive orders m are obtained for<br>
	the representation of the sound in said base of<br>
	spherical harmonics, and<br>
30	-	 a global filter is applied, the coefficients of<br>
	which, each applied to a component of order m, are<br>
	expressed analytically in the form of a fraction, in<br>
	which;<br>
	-	the numerator is a polynomial of power m, whose<br>
35	 variable is inversely proportional to the sound<br>
	frequency and to said first distance, so as to<br>
	simulate a near field effect of the virtual<br>
	source, and<br><br><br>
- 8 -<br>
	-	the denominator is a polynomial of power m,<br>
	whose variable is inversely proportional to the<br>
	sound frequency and to said second distance, so as<br>
	to compensate for the effect of she near field of<br>
5	 the virtual source in the low sound frequencies.<br>
	Preferably, one transmits to the playback device the<br>
	data coded and filtered in steps a) and b) with a<br>
	parameter representative of said second distance,<br>
10<br>
	as a supplement or as a variant, the playback device<br>
	comprising means for reading a memory medium, one<br>
	stores on a memory medium intended to be read by the<br>
	playback device the data coded and filtered in steps a)<br>
15	and b) with a parameter representitive of said second<br>
	distance.<br>
	Advantageously, prior to a sound playback by a playback<br>
	device comprising a plurality of loudspeakers disposed<br>
20 	at a third distance from said point of auditory<br>
	perception, an adaptation filter whose coefficients are<br>
	dependent on said second and third distances is applied<br>
	to the coded and filtered data.<br>
25	In a particular embodiment, the coefficients of said<br>
	adaptation filter, each applied to a component of order<br>
	m, are expressed analytically in the form of a<br>
	fraction, in which:<br>
	-	the numerator is a polynomial of power m, whose<br>
30	variable is inversely proportional to the sound<br>
	frequency and to said second distance,<br>
	-	and the denominator is a polynomial of power m,<br>
	whose variable is inversely proportional to ths sound<br>
	frequency and to said third distance,<br>
35<br>
	Advantageously, for the implementation of step b),<br>
	there is provided:<br>
	-	in respect of the components of even order m,<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
	audiodigital filters in the form of a cascade of cells<br>
	of order two; and<br>
	-	in respect of the components of odd order m,<br>
	audiodigital filters in the form of a cascade of cells<br>
5	 of order two and an additional cell of order one.<br>
	In this embodiment, ths coefficients of an audio-digital<br>
	filter, for a component of order m, are defined from<br>
	the numerical values of the roots of said polynomials<br>
10 	of power m.<br>
	In a particular embodiment, said polynomials are Bessel<br>
	polynomials,<br>
15	On acquisition of the sound signals, thfere is<br>
	advantageously provided a microphone comprising an<br>
	array of acoustic transducers arranged substantially on<br>
	the surface of a sphere whose center corresponds<br>
	substantially to said reference point, so as to obtain<br>
20 	said signals representative of at least one sound<br>
	propagating in the three-dimensional space.<br>
	In this embodiment a global filter is applied in step<br>
	b) so as, on the one hand, to compensate for a near<br>
25	field effect as a function of said second distance and,<br>
	on the other hand, to equalize the signals arising from<br>
	the transducers so as to compensate for a weighting of<br>
	directivity of said transducers.<br>
30	Preferably, there is provided a number of transducers<br>
	that depends on a total number of components chosen to<br>
	represent the sound in said base of spherical<br>
	harmonics.<br>
35	According to an advantageous characteristic, in step a)<br>
	a total number; of components is chosen from the base of<br>
	spherical harmonics so as to obtain, on playback, a<br>
	region of the space around the point of perception in<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	which the playback of the sound is faithful and whose<br>
	dimensions are increasing with the total number of<br>
	components.<br>
5	Preferably, there is furthermore provided a playback<br>
	device comprising a number of loudspeakers at least<br>

	"bintaural synthesis" technique, and<br>
	-	the compensation of step b) is applied with said<br>

	a base of spherical harmonics, of origin corresponding<br>
	to the center of said sphere,<br>

15	 the sense of the invention.<br>
	Reference is firstly made to figure 1 which represents<br>
	by way of illustration a global system for sound<br>
	spatialization A module la for simulating a virtual<br>
20	scene defines a sound object as a virtual source of a<br>
	signal, for example monophonic, with chosen position in<br>
	three-dimensional space and which defines a direction<br>
	of the sound. Specifications of the geometry of a<br>
	virtual room may furthermore be provided so as to<br>
25	simulate a reverberation of the sound. A processing<br>
	module 11 applies a management of one or more of these<br>
	sources with respect to a listener (definition of a<br>
	virtual position of the sources with respect to this<br>
	listener). It implements a room effect processor for<br>
30	simulating reverberations or the like by applying<br>
	delays and/or standard filterings. The signals thus<br>
	constructed are transmitted to a module 2a for the<br>
	spatial encoding of the elementary contributions of the<br>
	sources.<br>
30<br>
	In parallel with this, a natural capture of sound may<br>
	be performed within the framework of a sound recording<br>
	by one or more microphones disposed in a chosen manner<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
	with respect to the real sources (module lb) , The<br>
	signals picked up by the microphones are encoded by a<br>
	module 2b. The * signals acquired and encoded nay be<br>
	 transforced according to en intermediate representation<br>
5	 format (module 3b), befits being mixed by the module 3<br>
	with the signals generated by the module la and encoded<br>
	by the module 2a (arising from the virtual sources).<br>
	The mixed signals are thereafter transmitted, or else<br>
	stored on a medium, with a view to a later playback<br>
10	(arrow TR) . They are thereafter applied to a decoding<br>
	module 5, with a view to playback on a playback device<br>
	6 comprising loudspeakers. As the case may be, the<br>
	decoding step 5 may be preceded by a step of<br>
	manipulating the sound field, for example by rotation,<br>
15	by virtue of a processing module 4 provided upstream of<br>
	the decoding module 5.<br>
	The playback device may take the form of a multiplicity<br>
	of loudspeakerst arranged for example on the surface of<br>
20	a sphere in a three-dimensional (periphonic)<br>
	configuration so as to ensure, on playback, in<br>
	particular an awareness of a direction of the sound in<br>
	three-dimensional space. For this purpose, a listener<br>
	generally stations himself at the center of the sphere<br>
25	formed by the array of loudspeakers, this center<br>
	corresponding to the abovementioned point of auditory<br>
	perception. As a variant, the loudspeakers of the<br>
	playback device may the arranged in a plane<br>
	(bidimensional panoramic; configuration) , the<br>
30	loudspeakers being disposed in particular on e circle<br>
	and the listener usually stationed at the center of<br>
	this circle. In another; variant, the playback device<br>
	may take the form of a device of "surround" type (5.1).<br>
	Finally, in an advantageous variant, the playback<br>
35	device may take the form of a headset with two<br>
	headphones for binaural synthesis of the sound played<br>
	back, which allows the listener to be aware of a<br>
	direction of the sources in three -dimensional space, as<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
	will be seen further on in detail. Such s. playback<br>
	device with two loudspeakers, fox awareness in three-<br>
	dimensional space, may also take the form of a<br>
	transaural playback device, with two loudspeakers<br>
5	 disposed at a chosen distance from a listener.<br>
	Reference is now made to figure 2 to describe a spatial<br>
	encoding and a decoding for a three-dimensional sound<br>
	playback, of elementary sound sources. The signal<br>
10	arising from a source 1 to N, as well as its position<br>
	(real or virtual 1 are transtimtted to a spatial encoding<br>
	module 2. Its position may equally well be defined in<br>
	terms of incidence (direction of the source viewed from<br>
	the listener) or in terms of distance between this<br>
15	source and a listener. The plurality of the signals<br>
	thus encoded makes it possible to obtain a multichannel<br>
	representation of a global sound field. The signals<br>
	encoded are transmitted (arrow TR) to a sound playback<br>
	device 6, for sound playback in three-dimensional<br>
20	space, as indicated hereinabove with reference to<br>
	figure 1.<br>
	Reference is now made to figure 3 to describe<br>
	hereinbelow the ambisonic representation by spherical<br>
25	harmonics in three-dimensional space, of an acoustic<br>
	field. We consider a zone about an origin 0 (sphere of<br>
	radius R) devoid of any acoustic source. We adopt a<br>
	system of spherical coordinates in which each vector<br>
	from the origin 0 to a point of the sphere is described<br>
30	by an azimuth qr, an elevation dr and a radius r<br>
	(corresponding to the distance from the origin O) .<br>
	The pressure field ptr) inside this sphere (r 
	R is the radius of the sphere) may be written in the<br>
35	frequency domain as a series whose terms are the<br>
	weighted products of angular functions Y°mn (q,d) and of<br>
	the radial function jm(kr) which thus depend on a<br>
	propagation term where k=2pf/c, where f is the sound<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
	frequency and c is the speed of sound in the<br>
	propagation medium.<br>
	The pressure field, may then be expressed as:<br>
5<br><br>
	The set of weighting factors B0mn, which are implicitly<br>
	dependent on frequency, thus describe the pressure<br>
10	field in the zone considered. For this reason, these<br>
	factors are called "spherical harmonic components" and<br>
	represent a frequency expression for the sound (or for<br>
	the pcessuce field! in the base of spherical harmonics<br>
	Yqmin<br>
15<br>
	The angular functions are called "spherical harmonics"<br>
	and are defined by:<br><br>
20	 where<br>
	Pmn(sind are Legendre functions of degree m and of<br>
	order n;<br>
	dp,q is the KrÖnecker symbol (equal to 1 if p=q and 0<br>
	otherwise).<br>
25<br>
	Spherical harmonics form an orthonormal base where the<br>
	scalar products between harmenic components and, in a<br>
	general manner between two functions F and (G, are<br>
	respectively defined by:<br>
30<br><br><br>
- 18 -<br><br>
	 Spherical harmonics are real functions that are<br>
5	 bounded, as represented in figure 4, as a function of<br>
	the order m and of the indices n and s. The light and<br>
	darks parts correspond respectively to the positive and<br>
	negative values of the spherical harmonic functions.<br>
	The higher the order m, the higher the angular<br>
10 	frequency (and hence the discrimitation between<br>
	functions). The radial functions jw(kr) are spherical<br>
	Bessel functions, whose modulus is illustrated for a<br>
	few values of the order m in figure 5.<br>
15	An interpretation of the ambisonic representation by a<br>
	base of spherical harmonics may be given as follows.<br>
	The ambisonic components of; like order m ultimately<br>
	express * derivatives" or "-moments" of order m of the<br>
	pressure field in the neighborhood of the origin 0<br>
20 	(center of the sphere represented in figure 3).<br>
	In particular, B+111=W describes the scalar magnitude of<br>
	the pressure, while B+111 = X, B111 = Y, B+110 = 2 are related<br>
	to the pressure gradients (or else to the particular<br>
25	 velocity) at the origin 0, These first four components<br>
	W, X, Y and 2 are obtained during the natural capture<br>
	of sound with the aid of omnidirectional microphones<br>
	(for the component W of order 0) and bi-directional<br>
	jnicrophonea (for the subsequent other three<br>
30	components). By using a larger number of acoustic<br>
	transducers, an appropriate processing, in particular<br>
	by equalization, makes it possible to obtain further<br>
	ambisonic components higher orders m greater than 1) ,<br>
35	By tilting into account the additional components of<br>
	highet order (greater than 1) , hence by increasing the<br><br>
- 19-<br>
	angular resolution of the ambisonic description, access<br>
	is gained to an approximation of the pressure field<br>
	over a wider neighborhood with regard to the wavelength<br>
	of the sound wave, about the origin 0. It will thus be<br>
5	understood that there exists a tight gelation between<br>
	the angular resolution (order of the spherical<br>
	harmonics) and the radial range (radius r) which can. be<br>
	represented. In short, on moving spatially away from,<br>
	the origin, point 0 of figurs 3, the higher is the<br>
10	number of ambisonic components (order M high) and the<br>
	better is the representation of the sound by the set of<br>
	these ambisonic components. It will also be understood<br>
	that the ambisonic representation of the sound is<br>
	however less satisfactory as one moves away from the<br>
15	origin O. This effect becomes critical in particular<br>
	for high sound frequencies (of short wavelength). It ia<br>
	therefore of interest to obtain the largest possible<br>
	number of ambisonic components, thereby making it<br>
	possible to create a region of space around the point<br>
20	of perception end in which the playback of the sound is<br>
	faithful and whose dimensions are increasing with the<br>
	total number of components.<br>
	Described hereinbelow is an application to &amp;<br>
25	 spatialized sound encoding/transmission/playback<br>
	system.<br>
	In practice, an ambiscnic system takes into account a<br>
	subset of spherical harmonic components, as described<br>
30	hereinabove. one speaks of a system of order M when the<br>
	latter takes into account ambiscnic components of index<br>
	m 
	with*loudspeakers, it will be understood that if these<br>
	loudspeakers are disposed in a horizontal plane, only<br>
35	the harmonics of index m = n are utilized. On the other<br>
	hand, when the playback device comprises loudspeakers<br>
	disposed over the surface of a sphere ("periphony") , it<br>
	is in principle possible to utilise as many harmonics<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
	as there exist loudspeakers,<br>
	The reference S designates the pressure signal carried<br>
	by a plane wave and picked up at the point o<br>
5	 corresponding to the center of the sphere of figure 3<br>
	(origin of the base in spherical coordinates) . The<br>
	incidence of the wave is described by the azimuth q and<br>
	the elevation d. The expression for the components of<br>
	the field associated with this plane wave is given by<br>
10	 the relation:<br><br>
	To encode (simulate) a near field source at a distance<br>
	p from the origin O, a filter Fm(1p/c) is applied so as to<br>
15	"curve" the shape of the wavefronts, by considering<br>
	that a near field emits, to a first approximation, a<br>
	spherical wave. The encoded components of the field<br>
become:<br><br>
20	 and the expression for the aforesaid filter F0(p/c) is<br>
	given by the relation:<br><br>
	where w  = 2pf is the angular frequency of the wave, f<br>
	being the sound frequency.<br>
25<br>
	These latter two relations [A4] and [A5] ultimately<br>
	show that, both for a virtual source (simulated) and<br>
	for a real source in the near field, the components of<br>
	the sound in the ambisonic representation are expressed<br>
30	mathematically (in particular analytically) in the form<br>
	of a polynomial, here a Bessel polynomial, of power m<br>
	and whose variable (c/2jwp) is inversely proportional<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
	to the sound frequency.<br>
	Thus, it will be understood that;<br>
	 - 	in the case of. a plane wave, the encoding produces<br>
5 	signals which differ from the original signal only by a<br>
	real, finite gain, this corresponding to a purely<br>
	directional encoding (relation [A3]);<br>
	in the case of a spherical wave (near field<br>
	source), the additional filter Fm(p/c)(w) encodes the<br>
l0	 distance cue by introducing, into the expression for<br>
	the ambisonic components, complex amplitude ratios<br>
	which depend on frequency, as expressed in relation<br>
	[AS] .<br>
15	 It should be noted that this additional filter ia of<br>
	"integrator" type, with an amplification effect that<br>
	increases and diverges (is unbounded) as the sound<br>
	frequencies decrease toward zero. Figure 6 shows, fore<br>
	each order in, an increase in the gain at low<br>
20 	frequencies (here the first distance p = 1 m) . One is<br>
	therefore dealing with unstable and divergent filters<br>
	when seeking to apply them to any audio signals . This<br>
	aivergence is all the more critical for orders m of<br>
	high value.<br>
25<br>
	It will be understood in particular, from relations<br>
	[A3], [A4] and (A5] , that the modeling of a virtual<br>
	source in the neat field exhibits divergent ambisonic<br>
	components at low frequenciee, in a manner; which is<br>
30	particularly critical for high orders m, as is<br>
	represented in figure 6. This divergence, in the low<br>
	frequencies, corresponds to the phenomenon of<br>
	"bass boost" stated hereinabove, it also manifests<br>
	itself in sound. acquisition,, for real sources,<br>
35<br>
	For this reason in particular, the ambisonic approach,<br>
	especially for high orders mf has not experienced, in<br>
	the state of the art, concrete application (other than<br><br>
- 22 - -<br>
	theoretical) in the processing of sound.<br>
	It Is understood in particular that compensation of the<br>
	 neat field is necessary so as to comply, on playback,<br>
5	 with the shape of the wavefronts encoded in the<br>
	ambisonic representation. Referring to figure 7, a<br>
	playback device comprises a plurality of loudspeakers<br>
	HP1, disposed at one and the same distance R1 in the<br>
	example described, from a point of auditory perception<br>
10	 P. In this figure 7:<br>
	each point at which a loudspeaker HP1 is situated<br>
	corresponds to a playback point stated hereinabove,<br>
	-	the point P is the above-stated point of auditory<br>
	perception,<br>
l5	-	 these points are separated by the second distance<br>
	R stated hereinabove,<br>
	while in figure 3 described hereinabove:<br>
	-	the point 0 corresponds to the reference point,<br>
	stated hereinabove, which forms the origin of the base<br>
20	 of spherical harmonics,<br>
	-	 the point M corresponds to the position of a<br>
	source (real or virtual) situated at the first distance<br>
	p, stated, hereinabove, from the reference point O.<br>
25	According to the invention, a pre-compensation at the<br>
	near field is introduced at the actual encoding stage,<br>
	this compensation involving filters of the analytical<br>
	from  and which are applied to the aforesaid<br>
	ambiaonic components B0mn .<br>
30<br>
	According to one of the advantages afforded by the<br>
	invention, the amplification Fm(p/a)(w) whose effect<br>
	appears in figure 6 is compensated for through the<br>
	atternation of the filter applied subsequent to the<br>
35 	encoding  - In particular, the coefficients of<br><br>
WO 2004/049299		 - 23 -		 PCT/FR2003/003367<br>
	this compensation filter increase with sound<br>
	frequency and, in particular, tend to zero, for low<br>
	frequencies. Advantageously, this pre-compensation,<br>
	performed tight from the encoding, ensures that the<br>
5	 data transmitted are not divergent for low frequencies.<br>
	To indicate the physical significance of the distance R<br>
	which comes into the compensation filter, we consider,<br>
	by way of illustration an initial, real plane wave<br>
10	upon the acquisition of the sound signals. To simulate<br>
	a near field effect of this far source, one applies the<br>
	first filter of relation [A5], as indicated in relation<br>
	[A4]. The distance p then represents a distance between<br>
	a near virtual source K and the point O representing<br>
15	the origin of the spherical base of figure 3. A first<br>
	filter for near field simulation is thus applied to<br>
	simulate the presence of a virtual source at the above-<br>
	described distance p. Nevertheless, on the one hand, as<br>
	indicated hereinabove, the terms of the coefficient of<br>
20	this filter diverge in the low frequencies (figure 6)<br>
	and, on the other hand, the aforesaid distance p will<br>
	not necessarily represent the distance between<br>
	loudspeakers of a playback device and a point P of<br>
	perception (figure 1) . According to the invention, a<br>
25	 pre-compensation is applied, on encoding, involving a<br>
	filter of the type as indicated hereinabove,<br>
	thereby making it possible, on the one hand, to<br>
	transmit bounded signals, and, on the other hand, to<br>
	choose the distance R, right from the encoding, for the<br>
30	playback of the sound using the loudspeakers HP1, as<br>
	represented in figure 7 . In particular, it will be<br>
	under stood that if one has simulated, on acquisition, a,<br>
	virtual source placed at the distance p from the origin<br>
	0, on playback (figure 7) , a listener stationed at the<br>
35	point p of auditory perception (at a distance R from<br>
	 the loudspeakers HP1) will be aware, on listening, of<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
	the presence of a sound source S stationed at the<br>
	distance p from the point of perception P and which<br>
	corresponds to the virtual, source simulated during<br>
	acquisition.<br>
5<br>
	Thus, the pre-composition of the near field of the<br>
	loudspeakers Stationed at the distance R) , at the<br>
	encoding stage, may be combined with a simulated near<br>
	field effect of a virtual source stationed at a<br>
10	distance p. on encoding, a total filter resulting, on<br>
	the one hand, from the simulation of the near field,<br>
	and, on the other hand, from the compensation of the<br>
	near field, is ultimately brought into play, the<br>
	coefficients of this filter being expressable<br>
l5	 analytically by the relation:<br><br>
	The total filter given by relation [All] is stable and<br>
	constitutes the "distance encoding" part-- in the spatial<br>
	ambisonic encoding according to the invention, as<br>
20	represented in figure 3, The coefficients of these<br>
	filters correspond to monotonic transfer functions for<br>
	the frequency, which tend to the value 1 at high<br>
	frequencies and to the value (R/p)m at low frequencies.<br>
	By referring to figure 9, the energy spectra of the<br>
25 	filters Hm NPC(P/c,R/c) convey the amplification of the<br>
	encoded components, that are due to the field effect of<br>
	the virtual source (stationed here at a distance<br>
	p = 1 ml, with a pre-compensation, of the field of<br>
	loudspeakers (stationed at a distance R = 1,5 m) . The<br>
30	amplification in decibels is therefore positive when<br>
	p  R (case<br>
	of figure 10 where P = 3 m and R = 1.5 m). In a<br>
	ofspatialized playback device, the distance R between a<br>
	point of auditory perception and the loudspeakers HP1<br>
35	 is actually of the order of one or a few meters.<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
	Referring again to figure 8, it will be understood<br>
	that, apart from the customary direction parameters q<br>
	and d, a cue regarding the distances which are involved<br>
5 	in the encoding will be transmitted. Thus, the angular<br>
	functions corresponding to the spherical harmonica<br>
	Y°mn(q,d) are retained for the directional encoding.<br>
	However, within the sense of, the present invention,<br>
10	 provision is furthermore made for total filters (near<br>
	field compensation and, as the case may be, simulation<br>
	of a near: field} HmNFC(p/c,R/c)(w) whish are applied to the<br>
	ambisonic components, as a function of their order m,<br>
	to achieve the distance encoding, as represented in<br>
15 	figure 6 An embodiment of these filters in the<br>
	audiodigital domain will he described in detail Later<br>
	on.<br>
	It will be noted in particular that these filters may<br>
20	be applied right from the very distance encoding (r)<br>
	and even before the direction encoding (6, 5) . It will<br>
	thus be understood that steps a) and b) hereinabove may<br>
	be brought together Into one and the same global step,<br>
	or even be swapped (with a distance encoding and<br>
25	compensation filtering, followed by a direction<br>
	encoding). The method according to the invention is<br>
	therefore not limited to successive temporal<br>
	implementation of steps a) and b).<br>
30	Figure 11A represents a visualization (viewed from<br>
	above) of a reconstruction of a near field with<br>
	compensation, of a spherical wave, in the horizontal<br>
	plane (with the same distance parameters as those of<br>
	figure 9), for a system of total order M = 15 and a<br>
35	playback on 32 loudspeakers. Represented in figure 11B<br>
	is the propagation of the initial sound wave from a<br>
	near field source situated at a distance p from a point.<br>
	of the acquisition space which corresponds, in the<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
	playback space, to the point p of figure 7 of auditory<br>
	perception. It is noted in figure ll A that the<br>
	listeners symbolized by schematised heads J may<br>
	pinpoint the virtual source at one and the same<br>
5	geographical location situated at the distance p from<br>
	the point of perception P in figure 11B,<br>
	It is thus indeed verified that the shape of the<br>
	encoded wavefront is complied with after decoding and<br>
10	playback. However, interference on the right of the<br>
	point P such as represented in figure 11A is<br>
	noticeable, this interference being due to the fact<br>
	that the number of loudspeakers (hence of ambisonic<br>
	components taken into account} is not sufficient for<br>
15	perfect reconstruction of the wavefront involved over<br>
	the whole surface delimited by the loudspeakers.<br>
	In what follows, we describe, by way of example, the<br>
	obtaining of an audiodigital filter for the<br>
20	implementation of the method within the sense of the<br>
	invention.<br>
	As indicated hereinabove, if one is seeking to simulate<br>
	a near field effect, compensated right front encoding, a<br>
25	filter of the form:<br><br>
	is applied to the ambisonic components of the sound.<br>
	From the expression for the simulation of a near field<br>
30	given by relation [A5], it is apparent that for far<br>
	sources (p - µ), relation [All] simply becomes;<br><br><br>
- 27 -<br>
	It Is therefore apparent from this latter relation<br>
	[A12] that the case where the source to be simulated<br>
	emits in the far field (far source) it is merely a.<br>
	particular case of the general expression for the<br>
5 	filter, as formulated in relation [All] .<br>
	Within the realm of audio digital processing, an<br>
	advantageous method of defining a digital filter from<br>
	the analytical expression of this filter in the<br>
10	continuous-time analog domain consists of a.<br>
	"bilinear transform".<br>
	Relation [A5] is firstly expressed in the form of a<br>
	Laplace transform, this corresponding to:<br><br><br>
- 28 -<br><br>
10	and are expressed in table 1 hereinbelow, for various<br>
	 orders m, in the respective forms of their real part,<br>
	their modulas (separated by a comma) and their (real)<br>
	value when m is odd.<br><br><br>
- 29 -<br>
	Table_l: values Re(Xm,q) , (Xm,q)\ and(Xm,n) when m is<br>
	odd) of a Bessel polynomial as calculated with the aid<br>
	of the MATLAB© computation software.<br><br><br>
- 30 -<br><br>
	The digital filters are thus deployed using the values<br>
	of table 1, by providing cascades of cells of order 2<br>
5	(for m even), and an additional cell (for m odd) , using<br>
	relations [A14] given hereinabove,<br>
	Digital filters are thus embodied in an infinite<br>
	impulse response form, that can be easily parameterized<br>
10	as shown hereinbelow. It should be noted that an<br>
	implementation in finite impulse response form may be<br>
	envisaged and consists in calculating the complex<br>
	spectrum of the transfer function from the analytical<br>
	formula, then in deducing therefrom a finite impulse<br>
15	response by inverse Fourier transform. A convolution<br>
	operation is thereafter applied for the filtering.<br>
	Thus, by introducing this pre-compensation of the near<br>
	field on encoding, a modified ambisonic representation<br>
20	(figure 5) is defined, adopting as transmissible<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
	representation, signals expressed in the frequency<br>
	domain, in the form:<br><br>
5	As indicated hereinabove, R is a reference distance<br>
	with which is associated a compensated near field<br>
	effect and c is the speed of sound (typically 340 m/s<br>
	in air). This modified ambisonic representation<br>
	possesses the same scalability properties (represented<br>
10	diagrammatically by transmitted data "surrounded" close<br>
	to the arrow TR of figure 1) and obeys the same field<br>
	rotation transformations (module 4 of figure 1) as the<br>
	customary ambisonic representation.<br>
15	Indicated hereinbelow are the operations to be<br>
	implemented for the decoding of the ambisonic signals<br>
	received.<br>
	It is firstly indicated that the decoding operation is<br>
20 	adaptable to any playback device, of radious R2,<br>
	different from the reference distance R hereinabove-<br>
	For this purpose, filters of the type HmNFC(p/c,R/c) (w), such<br>
	as described earlier, are applied but with distance<br>
	parameters H and R2, instead of p and R. In particular,<br>
25 	it should be noted that only the parameter R/c needs to<br>
	be stored and/or transmitted between the encoding and<br>
	the decoding.<br>
	Reffering to figure 12, the filtering module<br>
30 	represented therein is provided for example in a<br>
	processing unit of a playback device- The ambisonic<br>
	components received have being pre-compensated on<br>
	encoding for a reference distance R1 as second<br>
	distance. However, the playback device comprises a<br>
35	plurality of loudspeakers disposed" at a third distance<br>
	R2 from a point of auditory perception P, this third<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
	distance R2 being different from the aforesaid second<br>
	distance R1. The filtering module of figure 12, in the<br>
	form HmNFC(R1/c,R2/c) (w) , then adapts, on reception of the<br>
	data, the pre-compensation to the distance R1 for a<br>
5	playback at the distance R2, Of. course, as indicated<br>
	hereinabove, the playback device also receives the<br>
	parameter R1/c.<br>
	It should be noted that the invention furthermore makes<br>
10	it possible to mix several ambisonic representations of<br>
	sound fields (real and/or virtual sources), whose<br>
	reference distances R are different (as the case may be<br>
	with infinite reference distances corresponding to far<br>
	sources). Preferably, a pre-compensation of all these<br>
15	sources at the smallest reference distance will be<br>
	filtered, before mixing the ambisonic signals, thereby<br>
	making it possible to obtain correct definition of the<br>
	sound relief on playback.<br>
20	Within the framework of a so-called "sound focusing"<br>
	processing with, on playback, a sound enrichment effect<br>
	for a chosen direction in space (in the manner of a<br>
	light projector illuminating in a chosen direction in<br>
	optics), involving a matrix processing of sound<br>
25	focusing (with weighting of the ambisonic components),<br>
	one advantageously applies the distance encoding with<br>
	near field pre-compensation in a manner combined with<br>
	the focusing processing,<br>
30	In what follows, an ambisonic decoding method is<br>
	described with compensation of the near field of<br>
	loudspeakers, on playback.<br>
	To reconstruct an acoustic field encoded according to<br>
35	 the ambisonic formalism, from the components Bn and by<br>
	using loudspeakers of a playback device which provides<br>
	for an "ideal" placement of a listener which<br>
	corresponds to the point of playback P of figure 7, the<br><br>
- 33 -<br>
	wave emitted by each Loudspeaker is defined by a prior<br>
	"re-encoding" processing of the ambisonic field at the<br>
	center of the playback device, as follows-<br>
5	In this "re-encoding" context, it is initially<br>
	considered for simplicity that the sources emit in the<br>
	far field.<br>
	Referring again to figure 7, the wave emitted by a<br>
10	loudspeaker of index i and of incidence (q1 and d) is<br>
	fed with a signal S1. This loudspeaker participates in<br>
	the reconstruction of the component B'mn through its<br>
	contribution Si.Y0mn (q1.d) .<br>
15	The vector ci of the encoding coefficients associated<br>
	with the loudspeakers of index i is expressed by the<br>
	relation:<br><br>
20	The vector S of signals emanating from the set of N<br>
	loudspeakers Is given by the expression:<br><br>
25	The encoding matrix for these N loudspeakers (which<br>
	 ultimately corresponds to a "re-encoding" matrix), is<br>
	expressed by the relation:<br><br><br>
- 34 -<br>
	where each term ci represents a vector according to the<br>
	above relation [Bl].<br>
	Thus, the reconstruction of the ambisonic field B' is<br>
	 defined by the relation:<br><br>
	Relation [B4] thus defines a re-encoding operation,<br>
	prior to playback- Ultimately, the decoding, as such,<br>
10	consists in comparing the original ambisonic signals<br>
	received by the playback device, in the form;<br><br>
	with the re-encoded signals it , so as to define the<br>
	15 general relation:<br>
	B' = B									 [B6]<br>
	This involves, in particular, determining the<br>
	coefficients of a decoding matrix D, which satisfies<br>
20	 the relation:<br>
	S = D.B 								[87]<br>
	Preferably, the number of loudspeakers is greater than<br>
	or equal to the number of ambisonic components to be<br>
25	decoded and the decoding matrix D may be expressed, as<br>
	 a function of the re-encoding matrix C, in the form:<br><br>
- 35 -<br><br>
	where the notation C corresponds to the transpose of<br>
	the matrix C.<br>
5	It should be noted that the definition of a decoding<br>
	satisfying different criteria for each frequency band<br>
	is possible, thereby taking it possible to offer<br>
	optimized playback as a function of the listening<br>
	conditions, in particular as regards the constraint of<br>
10	positioning at the center Q of the sphere of figure 3,<br>
	during playback. For this purpose, provision is<br>
	advantageously made for a simple filtering, by stepwise<br>
	frequency equalization, at each ambisonic component,<br>
15	However, to obtain a. reconstruction of an originally<br>
	encoded wave, it is necessary to correct the far field<br>
	assumption for tine loudspeakers, that is to say to<br>
	express the effect of their near field in the re-<br>
	encoding matrix C hereinabove and to invert this new<br>
20	system to define the decoder. For this purpose,<br>
	assuming concentricity Of the loudspeakers (disposed at<br>
	one and the same distance R from the point P of<br>
	figure 7) all the loudspeakers have the same near<br>
	field effect Fa(r/c) (w), on each ambisonic component of<br>
25	the type Bsmn . By introducing the near field terms in<br>
	the form of a diagonal matrix relation [B4]<br>
	hereinabove becomes:<br><br>
30 	Relation [B7] hereinabove becomes:<br><br><br>
- 36 -<br>
	Thus, the matrixing operation is preceded by a<br>
	filtering operation which compensates the near field on<br>
	each component Bmn, , and which may be implemented in<br>
	digital form, as described hereinabove, with, reference<br>
5 	to relation [A14] .<br>
	It will be recalled that in practice, the "re-encoding"<br>
	matrix C is specific to the playback device, Its<br>
	coefficients may be determined initially by<br>
10	parameterization and sound characterization of the<br>
	playback device reacting to a predetermined excitation,<br>
	The decoding matrix D is, likewise, specific to the<br>
	playback device. Its coefficients may be determined by<br>
	relation [B8] . Continuing with the previous notation<br>
15	where B is the matrix of precompensated ambisonic<br>
	components.. these latter may be transmitted to the<br>
	playback device in. matrix form B with:<br><br>
20	The playback device thereafter decodes the data<br>
	received in matrix form is (column vector of the<br>
	components transmitted) by applying the decoding matrix<br>
	D to the pre-compensated ambisonic components, so as to<br>
	form the signals S1 intended for feeding the<br>
25 	loudspeakers HP1, with:<br><br>
	Referring again to figure 12 if a decoding operation<br>
	has to be adapted to a playback device of different<br>
30	 radius R2 from the reference distance R1, a module for<br>
	adaptation prior to the decoding proper and described<br>
	hereinabove makes it possible to filter each ambisonic<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
	component Bmn, so- as to adapt it to a playback device<br>
	of radius R2, The decoding operation proper ia<br>
	performed thereafter, as described hereinabove, with<br>
	reference to relation [B11].<br>
5<br>
	An application of the invention to binaural synthesis<br>
	is described hereinbelow.<br>
	We refer to figure 13A in which a listener having a<br>
10	headset with two headphones of a binaural synthesis<br>
	device is represented. The two ears of the listener are<br>
	disposed at respective points oL (left ear) and OR<br>
	(right ear) in space. The center of the listener's head<br>
	is disposed at the point 0 and the radius of the<br>
15	listener's head is of value a. A sound source must be<br>
	perceived in an auditory manner at a point M in space,<br>
	situated at a distance r from the center of the<br>
	listener's head (and respectively at distance rR from<br>
	the right ear and rL from the left ear) . Additionally,<br>
20 	the direction of the source stationed at the point M is<br>
	defined by the vectors r, fB, and rL.<br>
	In a general manner, the birnaural synthesis is defined<br>
	as follows.<br>
25<br>
	Each listener has his own specific shape of ear. The<br>
	perception of a sound in space by this listener is done<br>
	by learning, from birth, as a function of the shape of<br>
	the ears (in particular the shape of the auricles and<br>
30	 the dimensions of the head) specific to this listener.<br>
	The perception of a sound in space is manifested inter<br>
	alia by the fact that the sound reaches one ear before<br>
	the other ear, this giving rise to a delay  between<br>
	the signals to be emitted by each headphone of the<br>
35	 playback device applying the binaural synthesis.<br>
	The playback device is parameterized initially, for one<br>
	and the same listener, by sweeping a sound source<br><br>
- 38 -<br>
	around his head, at one and the same distance R from<br>
	the center of his head. It will thus be understood that<br>
	this distance R may be considered to be a distance<br>
	between a "point of playback" as stated hereinabove and<br>
5	a point of auditory perception (here the center 0 of<br>
	the listener's head).<br>
	In what follows, the index L is associated with the<br>
	signal to be played back by the headphone adjoining the<br>
10	left ear and the index R is associated with the signal<br>
	to be played back by the headphone adjoining the right<br>
	ear. Referring to figure 13B, a delay can be applied to<br>
	the initial signal 3 for each pathway intended to<br>
	produce a signal for a distinct headphone. These delays<br>
15	t and tr are dependent on a maximum delay t MAXwhich<br>
	corresponds here to the ratio a/c where a, as indicated<br>
	previously, corresponds to the radius of the listener's<br>
	head and c to the speed of sound. In particular, these<br>
	delays are defined as a function of the difference in<br>
20 	distance from the point O (center of the head) to the<br>
	point M (position of the source whose sound is to be<br>
	played back, in figure 13A) and from each ear to this<br>
	point M. Advantageouslyt respective gains gj, and gR are<br>
	furthermore applied, to each pathway, which are<br>
25 	dependent on a ratio of the distances from the point O<br>
	to the point M and from each ear to the point M.<br>
	Respective modules applied to each pathway 2L and 2R<br>
	encode the signals of each pathway, in an ambisonic<br>
	representation, with near field pre-compensation NFC<br>
30	(standing for "Near Field Compensation") within the<br>
	sense of the present invention. It will thus be<br>
	understood that, by the implementation of the method<br>
	within the sense of the present invention, it is<br>
	possible to define the signals arising from the source<br>
35	 M, not only by their direction (azimuthal angles qL and<br>
	qa and angles of elevation dL and dR) , but also as a<br>
	function of the distance separating each ear rL and rR<br>
	from the source M. The signals thus encoded are<br><br>
- 39 -<br>
	transmitted to the playback device comprising ambisonic<br>
	decoding modules, for each pathway, 5t and 5R. Thus, an<br>
	ambisonic encoding/decoding is applied, with near field<br>
	compensation, for each pathway (left headphone, right<br>
5	headphone) in the playback with binaural synthesis<br>
	(here of “B-FORMAT" type), in duplicate form. The near<br>
	field compensation is performed, for each pathway, with<br>
	as first distance p a distance rL and m between each<br>
	ear and the position M of the sound source to be played<br>
10	 back.<br>
	Described hereinbelow is an application of the<br>
	compensation within the sense of the invention, within<br>
	the context of sound acquisition in ambisonic<br>
l5	 representation.<br>
	Reference is made to figure 14 in which a microphone<br>
	141 comprises a plurality of transducer capsules,<br>
	capable of picking up acoustic pressures and<br>
20	reconstructing electrical signals Si,...rSN. The capsules<br>
	CAPi are arranged on a sphere of predetermined radius r<br>
	(here, a rigid sphere, such as a ping-pong ball for<br>
	example), The capsules are separated by a regular<br>
	spacing over the sphere. In practice, the number N of<br>
25	capsules is chosen as a function of the desired order M<br>
	of the ambisonic representation.<br>
	Indicated hereinbelow, within the context of" a<br>
	microphone comprising capsules arranged on a rigid<br>
30	sphere, is the manner of compensating for the near<br>
	field effect, right from the encoding in the ambisonic<br>
	context. It will thus be shown that the pre-<br>
	compensation of the near field may be applied not only<br>
	for virtual source simulation, as indicated<br>
35	hereinabove, but also upon acquisition and, in a more<br>
	general manner, by combining the near field pre-<br>
	compensation with all types of processing involving<br>
	ambisonic representation.<br><br>
- 40 -<br>
	In the presence of a rigid sphere (liable to introduce<br>
	a diffraction of the sound waves received) , relation<br>
	[A.1] given hereinabove becomes:<br><br>
5<br>
	The derivatives of the spherical Hankel functions h-m<br>
	Obey the recurrence law:<br><br>
10 <br>
	We deduce the ambisonic components B0mn of the initial<br>
	field from the pressure field at the surface of the<br>
	sphere, by implementing projection and equalisation<br>
	operations given by relation:<br><br>
15<br>
	In this expression, EQm is an equalizer filter which<br>
	compensates for a weighting Wm which is related to the<br>
	directivity of the capsules and which furthermore<br>
20	includes the diffraction by the rigid sphere.<br>
	The expression for this filter EQm is given by the<br>
	following relation:<br><br>
25<br>
	The coefficients of this equalisation filter are not<br>
	stable and an infinite gain is obtained at very low<br>
	frequencies- Moreover, it is appropriate to note that<br>
	the spherical harmonic components, themselves, are not<br>
30	of finite amplitude when the sound field is not limited<br><br><br>
- 41 -<br>
	to a propagation of plane waves, that is to say ones<br>
	which arise from far sources, as was seen previously.<br>
	Additionally, if, rather than providing capsules<br>
5	 embedded in a solid sphere, provision is ciade for<br>
	cardioid type capsules, with a far field directivity<br>
	given by the expression;<br>
	G(q) = a+(1-a) cosq								[C5]<br>
10	By considering these capsules mounted on an<br>
	"acoustically transparent" support, the weighting term<br>
	to be compensated becomes:<br><br>
15	It is again apparent that the coefficients of an<br>
	equalization filter corresponding to the analytical<br>
	inverse of this weighting given by relation [C6] are<br>
	divergent for very 1OW frequencies.<br>
20	In general, it is indicated that for any type of<br>
	directivity of sensors, the gain of the filter EQm to<br>
	compensate for the weighting Wm related to the<br>
	directivity of the sensors is infinite for low sound<br>
	frequencies. Referring to figure 14, a near field pre-<br>
25	compensation is advantageously applied in the actual<br>
	expression for the equalisation filter EQm, given by<br>
	the relation;<br><br>
30	Thus, the signals Si to SM are recovered from the<br>
	microphone 1-41- As appropriate, a pre-equalization of<br>
	these signals is applied by a processing module 142.<br>
	The module 14 3 makes it possible to express these<br>
	signals in the ambisonic context, in matrix form. The<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
	module 144 applies the filter of relation [C7] to the<br>
	ambisonic components expressed as a function of the<br>
	radius r of the sphere of the microphone 141. The near<br>
	field compensation is performed for a reference<br>
5	distance R as second distance. The encoded signals thus<br>
	filtered by the module 144 may be transmitted as the<br>
	case may be, with the parameter representative of the<br>
	reference distance R/c.<br>
10	Thus, it is apparent in the various embodiments related<br>
	respectively to the creation of a near field virtual<br>
	source, to the acquisition of sound signals arising<br>
	from real sources, or even to playback (to compensate<br>
	for a near field effect of the loudspeakers) , that the<br>
15	 near field compensation within the sense of the present<br>
	invention may be applied, to all types of processing<br>
	involving an ambisonic representation. This near field<br>
	compensation makes it possible to apply the ambisonic<br>
	representation to a multiplicity of sound contexts<br>
20	 where the direction of a source and advantageously its<br>
	distance must be taken into account. Moreover, the<br>
	possibility of the representation of sound phenomena of<br>
	all types (near or far fields) within the ambisonic<br>
	context is ensured by this pre-compensation, on account<br>
25	of the limitation to finite real values of the<br>
	ambisonic components.<br>
	Of course, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
	embodiment described hereinabove by way of example,- it<br>
30	 extends to other variants.<br>
	Thus, it will be understood that the near field pre-<br>
	compensation may be integrated, on encoding, as much<br>
	for a near source as for a far source. In the latter<br>
35	case (far source and reception of plane waves), the<br>
	distance r expressed hereinabove will be considered to<br>
	be infinite", without substantially modifying the<br>
	expression for the filters Hm which was given<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
	hereinabove. Thus, the processing using room effect<br>
	processors which in general provide uncorrelated<br>
	signals usable to model the late diffuse field (late<br>
	reverberation) may be combined with near field pre-<br>
5	compensation. These signals may be considered to be of<br>
	like energy and to correspond to a share of diffuse<br>
	field corresponding to the omnidirectional component<br>
	W=B+1on (figure 4) , The various spherical harmonic<br>
	components (with a chosen order M) can then be<br>
10	constructed by applying a gain correction for each<br>
	ambisonic component and a near field compensation of<br>
	the loudspeakers is applied (with a reference distance<br>
	R separating .the loudspeakers from the point of<br>
	auditory perception, as represented in figure 7).<br>
15<br>
	Of course, the principle of encoding within the sense<br>
	of the present invention is generalizable to radiation<br>
	models other than monopolar sources real or virtual)<br>
	and/or loudspeakers, Specifically, any shape of<br>
	20 radiation (in particular a source spread through space)<br>
	may be expressed by integration of a continuous<br>
	distribution of elementary point sources.<br>
	Furthermore, in the context of playback, it is possible<br>
25	to adapt the near field compensation to any playback<br>
	context. For this purpose, provision may be made to<br>
	calculate transfer functions (re-encoding of the near<br>
	field spherical harmonic components for each<br>
	loudspeaker, having regard to real propagation in the<br>
30	 room where the sound is played back) , as well as an<br>
	inversion of this re-encoding to redefine the decoding.<br>
	Described hereinabove was a decoding method in which a<br>
	matrix system involving the ambisonic components was<br>
35	applied. In a variant, provision may be made for a<br>

	requited for the decoding processing.<br>
	As indicated hereinabove with reference to figures 9<br>
	and 10, it is noted that the choice of a reference<br>
5	 distance R with respect to the distance p of the near<br>
	field source introduces a difference in gain for<br>
	various values of the sound frequency. It is indicated<br>
	that the method of encoding with pre-compensation may<br>
	be coupled with audiodigital compression making it<br>
10	 possible to quantize and adjust the gain for each<br>
	frequency sub-band.<br>
	Advantageously, the present invention applies to all<br>
	types of sound spatialization systems, in particular<br>
15	for applications of "victual reality" type (navigation<br>
	through virtual scenes in three-dimensional space,<br>
	games with three-dimensional sound spatialization,<br>
