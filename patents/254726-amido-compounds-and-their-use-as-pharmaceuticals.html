				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to modulators of 11-β hydroxyl steroid dehydrogenase type 1<br>
(11PHSD1) and/or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), compositions thereof and methods of using the<br>
same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that regulate fat metabolism, function and distribution.<br>
In vertebrates, glucocorticoids also have profound and diverse physiological effects on development,<br>
neurobiology, inflammation, blood pressure, metabolism and programmed cell death. In humans, the<br>
primary endogenously-produced glucocorticoid is Cortisol. Cortisol is synthesized in the zona<br>
fasciculate of the adrenal cortex under the control of a short-term neuroendocrine feedback circuit<br>
called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Adrenal production of Cortisol proceeds under<br>
the control of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), a factor produced and secreted by the anterior<br>
pituitary. Production of ACTH in the anterior pituitary is itself highly regulated, driven by<br>
corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) produced by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.<br>
The HPA axis maintains circulating Cortisol concentrations within restricted limits, with forward drive<br>
at the diurnal maximum or during periods of stress, and is rapidly attenuated by a negative feedback<br>
loop resulting from the ability of Cortisol to suppress ACTH production in the anterior pituitary and<br>
CBH production in the hypothalamus.<br>
Aldosterone is another hormone produced by the adrenal cortex; aldosterone regulates sodium<br>
and potassium homeostasis. Fifty years ago, a role for aldosterone excess in human disease was<br>
reported in a description of the syndrome of primary aldosteronism (Conn, (1955), J. Lab. Clin. Med.<br>
45: 6-17). It is now clear that elevated levels of aldosterone are associated with deleterious effects on<br>
the heart and kidneys, and are a major contributing factor to morbidity and mortality in both heart<br>
failure and hypertension.<br>
Two members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and<br>
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), mediate Cortisol function in vivo, while the primary intracellular<br>
receptor for aldosterone is the MR. These receptors are also referred to as 'ligand-dependent<br>
transcription factors,' because their functionality is dependent on the receptor being bound to its<br><br>
ligand (for example, Cortisol); upon ligand-binding these receptors directly modulate transcription via<br>
DNA-binding zinc finger domains and transcriptional activation domains.<br>
Historically, the major determinants of glucocorticoid action were attributed to three primary<br>
factors: 1) circulating levels of glucocorticoid (driven primarily by the HPA axis), 2) protein binding<br>
of glucocorticoids in circulation, and 3) intracellular receptor density inside target tissues. Recently, a<br>
fourth determinant of glucocorticoid function was identified: tissue-specific pre-receptor metabolism<br>
by glucocorticoid-activating and -inactivating enzymes. These 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase<br>
(1 l-β-HSD) enzymes act as pre-receptor control enzymes that modulate activation of the GR and MR<br>
by regulation of glucocorticoid hormones. To date, two distinct isozymes of 11-beta-HSD have been<br>
cloned and characterized: 11βHSD1 (also known as 11-beta-HSD type 1, llbetaHSDl, HSD11B1,<br>
HDL, and HSD11L) and 11βHSD2. lβHSDl and 11βHSD2 catalyze the interconversion of<br>
hormonally active Cortisol (corticosterone in rodents) and inactive cortisone (11-<br>
dehydrocorticosterone in rodents). 11βHSD1 is widely distributed in rat and human tissues;<br>
expression of the enzyme and corresponding mRNA have been detected in lung, testis, and most<br>
abundantly in liver and adipose tissue. 11βHSDl catalyzes both 11-beta-dehydrogenation and the<br>
reverse 11-oxoreduction reaction, although 11βHSDl acts predominantly as a NADPH-dependent<br>
oxoreductase in intact cells and tissues, catalyzing the activation of Cortisol from inert cortisone (Low<br>
et al. (1994) J. Mol. Endocrin. 13: 167-174) and has been reported to regulate glucocorticoid access to<br>
the GR. Conversely, 11βHSD2 expression is found mainly in mineralocorticoid target tissues such as<br>
kidney, placenta, colon and salivary gland, acts as an NAD-dependent dehydrogenase catalyzing the<br>
inactivation of Cortisol to cortisone (Albiston et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Endocrin. 105: R11-R17), and<br>
has been found to protect the MR from glucocorticoid excess, such as high levels of receptor-active<br>
Cortisol (Blum, et al, (2003) Prog. Nucl. Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 75:173-216).<br>
In vitro, the MR binds Cortisol and aldosterone with' equal affinity. The tissue specificity of<br>
aldosterone activity, however, is conferred by the expression of 11βHSD2 (Funder et al. (1988),<br>
Science 242: 583-585). The inactivation of Cortisol to cortisone by 11βHSD2 at the site of the MR<br>
enables aldosterone to bind to this receptor in vivo. The binding of aldosterone to the MR results in<br>
dissociation of the ligand-activated MR from a multiprotein complex containing chaperone proteins, translocation of the MR into the nucleus, and its binding to hormone response elements in regulatory<br>
regions of target gene promoters. Within the distal nephron of the kidney, induction of serum and<br>
glucocorticoid inducible kinase-1 (sgk-1) expression leads to the absorption of Na+ ions and water<br>
through the epithelial sodium channel, as well as potassium excretion with subsequent volume<br>
expansion and hypertension (Bhargava et al., (2001), Endo 142: 1587-1594).<br>
In humans, elevated aldosterone concentrations are associated with endothelial dysfunction,<br>
myocardial infarction, left ventricular atrophy, and death. In attempts to modulate these ill effects,<br>
multiple intervention strategies have been adopted to control aldosterone overactivity and attenuate<br><br>
the resultant hypertension and its associated cardiovascular consequences. Inhibition of angiotensin-<br>
converting enzyme (ACE) and blockade of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) are two strategies<br>
that directly impact the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). However, although ACE<br>
inhibition and AT1R antagonism initially reduce aldosterone concentrations, circulating<br>
concentrations of this hormone return to baseline levels with chronic therapy (known as 'aldosterone<br>
escape'). Importantly, co-administration of the MR antagonist Spironolactone or Eplerenone directly<br>
blocks the deleterious effects of this escape mechanism and dramatically reduces patient mortality<br>
(Pitt et al., New England J. Med. (1999), 341: 709-719; Pitt et al., New England J. Med. (2003), 348:<br>
1309-1321). Therefore, MR antagonism may be an important treatment strategy for many patients<br>
with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, particularly those hypertensive patients at risk for<br>
target-organ damage.<br>
Mutations in either of the genes encoding the 11-beta-HSD enzymes are associated with<br>
human pathology. For example, 11βHSD2 is expressed in aldosterone-sensitive tissues such as the<br>
distal nephron, salivary gland, and colonic mucosa where its Cortisol dehydrogenase activity serves to<br>
protect the intrinsically non-selective MR from illicit occupation by Cortisol (Edwards et al. (1988)<br>
Lancet 2: 986-989). Individuals with mutations in 11βHSD2 are deficient in this cortisol-inactivation<br>
activity and, as a result, present with a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (also referred<br>
to as 'SAME') characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and sodium retention (Wilson et al.<br>
(1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 95: 10200-10205). Likewise, mutations in 11βHSD1, a primary<br>
regulator of tissue-specific glucocorticoid bioavailability, and in the gene encoding a co-localized<br>
NADPH-generating enzyme, hexose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD), can result in cortisone<br>
reductase deficiency (CRD), in which activation of cortisone to Cortisol does not occur, resulting in<br>
adrenocorticotropin-mediated androgen excess. CRD patients excrete virtually all glucocorticoids as<br>
cortisone metabolites (tetrathydrocortisone) with low or absent Cortisol metabolites<br>
(tetrahydrocortisols). When challenged with oral cortisone, CRD patients exhibit abnormally low<br>
plasma Cortisol concentrations. These individuals present with ACTH-mediated androgen excess<br>
(hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism), a phenotype resembling polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome (PCOS) (Draper et al. (2003) Nat. Genet. 34: 434-439).<br>
The importance of the HPA axis in controlling glucocorticoid excursions is evident from the<br>
fact that disruption of homeostasis in the HPA axis by either excess or deficient secretion or action<br>
results in Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease, respectively (Miller and Chrousos (2001)<br>
Endocrinology and Metabolism, eds. Felig and Frohman (McGraw-Hill, New York), 4th Ed.: 387-<br>
524). Patients with Cushing's syndrome (a rare disease characterized by systemic glucocorticoid<br>
excess originating from the adrenal or pituitary tumors) or receiving glucocorticoid therapy develop<br>
reversible visceral fat obesity. Interestingly, the phenotype of Cushing's syndrome patients closely<br>
resembles that of Reaven's metabolic syndrome (also known as Syndrome X or insulin resistance<br><br>
syndrome) the symptoms of which include visceral obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance,<br>
hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia (Reaven (1993) Ann. Rev. Med. 44: 121-131).<br>
However, the role of glucocorticoids in prevalent forms of human obesity has remained obscure<br>
because circulating glucocorticoid concentrations are not elevated in the majority of metabolic<br>
syndrome patients. In fact, glucocorticoid action on target tissue depends not only on circulating<br>
levels but also on intracellular concentration, locally enhanced action of glucocorticoids in adipose<br>
tissue and skeletal muscle has been demonstrated in metabolic syndrome. Evidence has accumulated<br>
that enzyme activity of 11βHSD1, which regenerates active glucocorticoids from inactive forms and<br>
plays a central role in regulating intracellular glucocorticoid concentration, is commonly elevated in<br>
fat depots from obese individuals. This suggests a role for local glucocorticoid reactivation in obesity<br>
and metabolic syndrome.<br>
Given the ability of 11βHSD1 to regenerate Cortisol from inert circulating cortisone,<br>
considerable attention has been given to its role in the amplification of glucocorticoid function.<br>
11βHSD1 is expressed in many key GR-rich tissues, including tissues of considerable metabolic<br>
importance such as liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle, and, as such, has been postulated to aid in the<br>
tissue-specific potentiation of glucocorticoid-mediated antagonism of insulin function. Considering a)<br>
the phenotypic similarity between glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's syndrome) and the metabolic<br>
syndrome with normal circulating glucocorticoids in the latter, as well as b) the ability of 11βHSD1 to<br>
generate active Cortisol from inactive cortisone in a tissue-specific manner, it has been suggested that<br>
central obesity and the associated metabolic complications in syndrome X result from increased<br>
activity of 11βHSD1 within adipose tissue, resulting in 'Cushing's disease of the omentum' (Bujalska<br>
et al. (1997) Lancet 349: 1210-1213). Indeed, 11βHSD1 has been shown to be upregulated in adipose<br>
tissue of obese rodents and humans (Livingstone et al. (2000) Endocrinology 131: 560-563; Rask et<br>
al. (2001) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 86: 1418-1421; Lindsay et al. (2003) J. Clin. Endocrinol.<br>
Metab. 88: 2738-2744; Wake et al. (2003) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 88: 3983-3988).<br>
Additional support for this notion has come from'studies in mouse transgenic models.<br>
Adipose-specific overexpression of 11βHSD1 under the control of the aP2 promoter in mouse<br>
produces a phenotype remarkably reminiscent of human metabolic syndrome (Masuzaki et al. (2001)<br>
Science 294: 2166-2170; Masuzaki et al. (2003) J. Clinical. Invest. 112: 83-90). Importantly, this<br>
phenotype occurs without an increase in total circulating corticosterone, but rather is driven by a local<br>
production of corticosterone within the adipose depots. The increased activity of 11βHSD1 in these<br>
mice (2-3 fold) is very similar to that observed in human obesity (Rask et al. (2001) J. Clin.<br>
Endocrinol. Metab. 86: 1418-1421). This suggests that local 11βHSD1-mediated conversion of inert<br>
glucocorticoid to active glucocorticoid can have profound influences whole body insulin sensitivity.<br>
Based on this data, it would be predicted that the loss of 11βHSD1 would lead to an increase<br>
in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance due to a tissue-specific deficiency in active glucocorticoid<br><br>
levels. This is, in fact, the case as shown in studies with 11βHSD1-deficient mice produced by<br>
homologous recombination (Kotelevstev et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94: 14924-14929; Morton<br>
et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276: 41293-41300; Morton et al. (2004) Diabetes 53: 931-938). These<br>
mice are completely devoid of 11-keto reductase activity, confirming that 11βHSD1 encodes the only<br>
activity capable of generating active corticosterone from inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone. 11βHSD1-<br>
def icient mice are resistant to diet- and stress-induced hyperglycemia, exhibit attenuated induction of<br>
hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes (PEPCK, G6P), show increased insulin sensitivity within adipose,<br>
and have an improved lipid profile (decreased triglycerides and increased cardio-protective HDL).<br>
Additionally, these animals show resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity. Taken together, these<br>
transgenic mouse studies confirm a role for local reactivation of glucocorticoids in controlling hepatic<br>
and peripheral insulin sensitivity, and suggest that inhibition of 11βHSD1 activity may prove<br>
beneficial in treating a number of glucocorticoid-related disorders, including obesity, insulin<br>
resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia.<br>
Data in support of this hypothesis has been published. Recently, it was reported that<br>
11βSHSD1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of central obesity and the appearance of the metabolic<br>
syndrome in humans. Increased expression of the 11βHSD1 gene is associated with metabolic<br>
abnormalities in obese women and that increased expression of this gene is suspected to contribute to<br>
the increased local conversion of cortisone to Cortisol in adipose tissue of obese individuals (Engeli, et<br>
al., (2004) Obes. Res. 12: 9-17).<br>
A new class of 11βHSD1 inhibitors, the arylsulfonamidothiazoles, was shown to improve<br>
hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduce blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic strains of mice (Barf et<br>
al. (2002) J. Med. Chem. 45: 3813-3815; Alberts et al. Endocrinology (2003) 144: 4755-4762).<br>
Furthermore, it was recently reported that selective inhibitors of 11βHSD1 can ameliorate severe<br>
hyperglycemia in genetically diabetic obese mice. Thus, 11βHSD1 is a promising pharmaceutical<br>
target for the treatment of the Metabolic Syndrome (Masuzaki, et al., (2003) Curr. Drug Targets<br>
Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 3: 255-62).<br>
A. Obesity and metabolic syndrome<br>
As described above, multiple lines of evidence suggest that inhibition of 11βHSD1 activity<br>
can be effective in combating obesity and/or aspects of the metabolic syndrome cluster, including<br>
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia.<br>
Glucocorticoids are known antagonists of insulin action, and reductions in local glucocorticoid levels<br>
by inhibition of intracellular cortisone to Cortisol conversion should increase hepatic and/or peripheral<br>
insulin sensitivity and potentially reduce visceral adiposity. As described above, 11βHSD1 knockout<br>
mice are resistant to hyperglycemia, exhibit attenuated induction of key hepatic gluconeogenic<br>
enzymes, show markedly increased insulin sensitivity within adipose, and have an improved lipid<br><br>
profile. Additionally, these animals show resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity (Kotelevstev et<br>
al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94: 14924-14929; Morton et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276: 41293-<br>
41300; Morton et al. (2004) Diabetes 53: 931-938). Thus, inhibition of 11βHSD1 is predicted to have<br>
multiple beneficial effects in the liver, adipose, and/or skeletal muscle, particularly related to<br>
alleviation of component(s) of the metabolic syndrome and/or obesity.<br>
B.	Pancreatic function<br>
Glucocorticoids are known to inhibit the glucose-stimulated secretion of insulin from<br>
pancreatic beta-cells (Billaudel and Sutter (1979) Horm. Metab. Res. 11: 555-560). In both Cushing's<br>
syndrome and diabetic Zucker fa/fa rats, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is markedly reduced<br>
(Ogawa et al. (1992) J. Clin. Invest. 90: 497-504). 11βHSD1 mRNA and activity has been reported in<br>
the pancreatic islet cells of ob/ob mice and inhibition of this activity with carbenoxolone, an<br>
11βHSD1 inhibitor, improves glucose-stimulated insulin release (Davani et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.<br>
275: 34841-34844). Thus, inhibition of 11βHSD1 is predicted to have beneficial effects on the<br>
pancreas, including the enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin release.<br>
C.	Cognition and dementia<br>
Mild cognitive impairment is a common feature of aging that may be ultimately related to the<br>
progression of dementia. In both aged animals and humans, inter-individual differences in general<br>
cognitive function have been linked to variability in the long-term exposure to glucocorticoids<br>
(Lupien et al. (1998) Nat. Neurosci. 1: 69-73). Further, dysregulation of the HPA axis resulting in<br>
chronic exposure to glucocorticoid excess in certain brain subregions has been proposed to contribute<br>
to the decline of cognitive function (McEwen and Sapolsky (1995) Curr. Opin. Neurbbiol. 5: 205-<br>
216). 11βHSD1 is abundant in the brain, and is expressed in multiple subregions including the<br>
hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum (Sandeep et al. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Early<br>
Edition: 1-6). Treatment of primary hippocampal cells with the 11βHSD1 inhibitor carbenoxolone<br>
protects the cells from gmcocorticoid-mediated exacerbation of excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity<br>
(Rajan et al. (1996) J. Neurosci. 16: 65-70). Additionally, 11βHSD1-deficient mice are protected<br>
from glucocorticoid-associated hippocampal dysfunction that is associated with aging (Yau et al.<br>
(2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98: 4716-4721). In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled<br>
crossover studies, administration of carbenoxolone improved verbal fluency and verbal memory<br>
(Sandeep et al. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Early Edition: 1-6). Thus, inhibition of 11βHSD1 is<br>
predicted to reduce exposure to glucocorticoids in the brain and protect against deleterious<br>
glucocorticoid effects on neuronal function, including cognitive impairment, dementia, and/or<br>
depression.<br><br>
D.	Intrα-ocular pressure<br>
Glucocorticoids can be used topically and systemically for a wide range of conditions in<br>
clinical ophthalmology. One particular complication with these treatment regimens is corticosteroid-<br>
induced glaucoma. This pathology is characterized by a significant increase in intrα-ocular pressure<br>
(IOP). In its most advanced and untreated form, IOP can lead to partial visual field loss and<br>
eventually blindness. IOP is produced by the relationship between aqueous humour production and<br>
drainage. Aqueous humour production occurs in the non-pigmented epithelial cells (NPE) and its<br>
drainage is through the cells of the trabecular meshwork. 11βHSD1 has been localized to NPE cells<br>
(Stokes et al. (2000) Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 41: 1629-1683; Rauz et al. (2001) Invest.<br>
Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 42: 2037-2042) and its function is likely relevant to the amplification of<br>
glucocorticoid activity within these cells. This notion has been confirmed by the observation that free<br>
Cortisol concentration greatly exceeds that of cortisone in the aqueous humour (14:1 ratio). The<br>
functional significance of 11βHSD1 in the eye has been evaluated using the inhibitor carbenoxolone<br>
in healthy volunteers (Rauz et al. (2001) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 42: 2037-2042). After seven<br>
days of carbenoxolone treatment, IOP was reduced by 18%. Thus, inhibition of 11βHSD1 in the eye<br>
is predicted to reduce local glucocorticoid concentrations and IOP, producing beneficial effects in the<br>
management of glaucoma and other visual disorders.<br>
E.	Hypertension<br>
Adipocyte-derived hypertensive substances such as leptin and angiotensinogen have been<br>
proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related hypertension (Matsuzawa et al. (1999)<br>
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 892: 146-154; Wajchenberg (2000) Endocr. Rev. 21: 697-738). Leptin, which<br>
is secreted in excess in aP2-11βHSD1 transgenic mice (Masuzaki et al. (2003) J. Clinical Invest 112:<br>
83-90), can activate various sympathetic nervous system pathways, including those that regulate<br>
blood pressure (Matsuzawa et al. (1999) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 892: 146-154). Additionally, the renin-<br>
angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to be a major determinant of blood pressure (Walker et al.<br>
(1979) Hypertension 1: 287-291). Angiotensinogen, which is produced in liver and adipose tissue, is<br>
the key substrate for renin and drives RAS activation. Plasma angiotensinogen levels are markedly<br>
elevated in aP2-11βHSD1 transgenic mice, as are angiotensin II and aldosterone (Masuzaki et al,<br>
(2003) J. Clinical Invest. 112: 83-90). These forces likely drive the elevated blood pressure observed<br>
in aP2-11βHSD1 transgenic mice. Treatment of these mice with low doses of an angiotensin II<br>
receptor antagonist abolishes this hypertension (Masuzaki et al. (2003) J. Clinical Invest. 112: 83-90).<br>
This data illustrates the importance of local glucocorticoid reactivation in adipose tissue and liver, and<br>
suggests that hypertension may be caused or exacerbated by 11βHSD1 activity. Thus, inhibition of<br>
11βHSD1 and reduction in adipose and/or hepatic glucocorticoid levels is predicted to have beneficial<br>
effects on hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular disorders.<br><br>
F.	Bone disease<br>
Glucocorticoids can have adverse effects on skeletal tissues. Continued exposure to even<br>
moderate glucocorticoid doses can result in osteoporosis (Cannalis (1996) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.<br>
81: 3441-3447) and increased risk for fractures. Experiments in vitro confirm the deleterious effects<br>
of glucocorticoids on both bone-resorbing cells (also known as osteoclasts) and bone forming cells<br>
(osteoblasts). 11βHSD1 has been shown to be present in cultures of human primary osteoblasts as<br>
well as cells from adult bone, likely a mixture of osteoclasts and osteoblasts (Cooper et al. (2000)<br>
Bone 27: 375-381), and the 11βHSD1 inhibitor carbenoxolone has been shown to attenuate the<br>
negative effects of glucocorticoids on bone nodule formation (Bellows et al. (1998) Bone 23: 119-<br>
125). Thus, inhibition of 11βHSD1 is predicted to decrease the local glucocorticoid concentration<br>
within osteoblasts and osteoclasts, producing beneficial effects in various forms of bone disease,<br>
including osteoporosis.<br>
Small molecule inhibitors of 11βHSD1 are currently being developed to treat or prevent<br>
11βHSD1-related diseases such as those described above. For example, certain amide-based<br>
inhibitors are reported in WO 2004/08947O, WO 2004/089896, WO 2004/056745, and WO<br>
2004/065351.<br>
Antagonists of 11βHSD1 have been evaluated in human clinical trials (Kurukulasuriya, et al.,<br>
(2003) Curr. Med. Chem. 10: 123-53).<br>
In light of the experimental data indicating a role for 11βHSD1 in glucocorticoid-related<br>
disorders, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,<br>
hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, androgen excess (hirsutism, menstrual irregularity,<br>
hyperandrogenism) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), therapeutic agents aimed at<br>
augmentation or suppression of these metabolic pathways, by modulating glucocorticoid signal<br>
transduction at the level of 11βHSD1 are desirable.<br>
Furthermore, because the MR binds to aldosterone (its natural ligand) and Cortisol with equal<br>
affinities, compounds that are designed to interact with the active site of 11βHSD1 (which binds to<br>
cortisone/cortisol) may also interact with the MR and act as antagonists. Because the MR is<br>
implicated in heart failure, hypertension, and related pathologies including atherosclerosis,<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, thrombosis, angina, peripheral vascular disease, vascular wall<br>
damage, and stroke, MR antagonists are desirable and may also be useful in treating complex<br>
cardiovascular, renal, and inflammatory pathologies including disorders of lipid metabolism including<br>
dyslipidemia or hyperlipoproteinaemia, diabetic dyslipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, as well as those associated with type 1 diabetes, type 2<br>
diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance, and general aldosterone-related target-<br>
organ damage.<br><br>
As evidenced herein, there is a continuing need for new and improved drugs that target<br>
11βHSD1 and/or MR. The compounds, compositions and methods described herein help meet this<br>
and other needs.<br>

At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the invention are<br>
disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention include each and every<br>
individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term "C1-6<br><br>
alkyl" is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and<br>
C6 alkyl.<br>
It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described<br>
in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.<br>
Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a<br>
single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.<br>
The term "n-membered" where n is an integer typically describes the number of ring-forming<br>
atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, piperidinyl is an<br>
example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of<br>
a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.<br>
For compounds of the invention in which a variable appears more than once, each variable<br>
can be a different moiety selected from the Markush group defining the variable. For example, where<br>
a structure is described having two R groups that are simultaneously present on the same compound;<br><br>
the two R groups can represent different moieties selected from the Markush group defined for R. In<br>
another example, when an optionally multiple substituent is designated in the form:<br><br>
then it is understood that substituent R can occur s number of times on the ring, and R can be a<br>
different moiety at each occurrence. Further, in the above example, should the variable Q be defined<br>
to include hydrogens, such as when Q is said to be CH2, NH, etc., any floating substituent such as R in<br>
the above example, can replace a hydrogen of the Q variable as well as a hydrogen in any other non-<br>
variable component of the ring.<br>

The compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more stereocenters).<br>
All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be<br>
isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from<br>
optically active starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or<br>
by stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can<br>
also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the<br>
present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms.<br>
Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods<br>
known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallizaion using a "chiral resolving<br>
acid" which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional<br>
recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric<br>
acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various<br>
optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as β-camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents<br>
suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of α-<br>

norephedrine, ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and<br>
the like.<br>
Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an<br>
optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent<br>
composition can be determined by one skilled in the art,<br>
Compounds of the invention also include tautomeric forms, such as keto-enol tautomers.<br>
Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the<br>
intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but<br>
different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds,<br>
materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical<br>
judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive<br>
toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a<br>
reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br><br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds<br>
described herein. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to derivatives of the<br>
disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base<br>
moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to,<br>
mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues<br>
such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention<br>
include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound<br>
formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or<br>
acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting<br>
the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base<br>
or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like<br>
ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found<br>
in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p.<br>
1418 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977), each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
The present invention also includes prodrugs of the compounds described herein. As used<br>
herein, "prodrugs" refer to any covalently bonded carriers which release the active parent drug when<br>
administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs can be prepared by modifying functional groups<br>
present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine<br>
manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein hydroxyl,<br>
amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a<br>
mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group<br>
respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate<br>
derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the invention. Preparation<br>
and use of prodrugs is discussed in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,"<br>
Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward<br>

incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Synthesis<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention can be prepared in a variety of ways known to<br>
one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized<br>
using the methods as hereinafter described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of<br>
synthetic organic chemistry or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials<br>
using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or<br><br>
preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents,<br>
pressures, etc.) are given; other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum<br>
reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be<br>
determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
The processes described herein can be monitored according to any suitable method known in<br>
the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or. 13C) infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g.,<br>
UV-visible), or mass spectrometry, or by chromatography such as high performance liquid<br>
chromatograpy (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography.<br>
Preparation of compounds can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical<br>
groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups<br>
can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found,<br>
for example, in Greene, et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out in suitable solvents which<br>
can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be<br>
substantially nonreactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the<br>
temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, i.e., temperatures which can range from the<br>
solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried<br>
out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step,<br>
suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected.<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms<br>
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of Formula I can be administered in the<br>
form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in<br>
the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local<br>
or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical<br>
(including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery),<br>
pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer;<br>
intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), ocular, oral or parenteral. Methods for ocular<br>
delivery can include topical administration (eye drops), subconjunctival, periocular or intravitreal<br>
injection or introduction by balloon catheter or ophthalmic inserts surgically placed in the<br>
conjunctival sac. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous,<br>
intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or<br><br>
intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or<br>
may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations<br>
for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops,<br>
suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or<br>
oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.<br>
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active<br>
ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the invention above in combination with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of the invention, the active<br>
ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a<br>
carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient<br>
serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or<br>
medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders,<br>
lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in<br>
a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10 % by weight of the active compound,<br>
soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged<br>
powders.<br>
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate<br>
particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially<br>
insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is<br>
substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially<br>
uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol,<br>
starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The<br>
formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and<br>
mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and<br>
propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention<br>
can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after<br>
administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br>
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from<br>
about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term<br>
"unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects<br>
and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to<br>
produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered<br>
in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the<br>
compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant<br><br>
circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual<br>
compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the<br>
patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such, as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with<br>
a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous<br>
mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions<br>
as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so<br>
that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as<br>
tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the<br>
type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to<br>
provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can<br>
comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope<br>
over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to<br>
be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such<br>
materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials<br>
as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be<br>
incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored<br>
syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The<br>
liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described<br>
supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route<br>
for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized<br>
solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be<br>
attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,<br>
suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver<br>
the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon<br>
what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state<br>
of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions<br>
can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at<br>
least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on<br><br>
the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending<br>
upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient,<br>
and the like.<br>
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization<br>
techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized,<br>
the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The<br>
pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and<br>
most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients,<br>
carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention can vary according to, for<br>
example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the<br>
compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The<br>
proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary<br>
depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity),<br>
and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an<br>
aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for<br>
parenteral adminstration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 µg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body<br>
weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg<br>
of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of<br>
progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative<br>
biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of<br>
administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro<br>
or animal model test systems.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be formulated in combination with one or more<br>
additional active ingredients which can include any pharmaceutical agent such as anti-viral agents,<br>
antibodies, immune suppressants, anti-inflammatory agents and the like.<br>
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to radio-labeled compounds of the invention<br>
that would be useful not only in radio-imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for<br>
localizing and quantitating the enzyme in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying ligands<br>
by inhibition binding of a radio-labeled compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes<br>
enzyme assays that contain such radio-labeled compounds.<br>
The present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention. An<br>
"isotopically" or "radio-labeled" compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms<br>
are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the<br><br>
atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable<br>
radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not<br>
limited to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N,<br>
15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36C1,82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 1231,124I, 125I and 131I. The radionuclide that is<br>
incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that<br>
radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro receptor labeling and competition assays,<br>
compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 125I,1311,35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-<br>
imaging applications 11C, 18F, I25I,123I,124I,131I,75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.<br>
It is understood that a "radio-labeled " or "labeled compound" is a compound that has<br>
incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the<br>
group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I,35S and 82Br.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to<br>
compounds of the invention and are well known in the art.<br>
A radio-labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to<br>
identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test<br>
compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the radio-labeled compound of the<br>
invention to the enzyme. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the radio-<br>
labeled compound for binding to the errzyme directly correlates to its binding affinity.<br>
Kits<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment<br>
or prevention of 11βHSD1-associated diseases or disorders, obesity, diabetes and other diseases<br>
referred to herein which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such kits can further<br>
include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for<br>
example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc.,<br>
as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels,<br>
indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or<br>
guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following<br>
examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any<br>
manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can<br>
be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The compounds of the example section<br>
were found to be inhibitors or antagonists of 11βHSD1 or MR according to one or more of the assays<br>
provided herein.<br><br>

Example A<br>
Enzymatic assay of 11βHSD1<br>
All in vitro assays were performed with clarified lysates as the source of 11βHSD1 activity.<br>
HEK-293 transient transfectants expressing an epitope-tagged version of full-length human 11J3HSD1<br><br>
were harvested by centrifugation. Roughly 2 x 107 cells were resuspended in 40 mL of lysis buffer<br>
(25 roM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 250mM sucrose) and lysed in a<br>
microfluidizer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants were aliquoted and<br>
frozen.<br>
Inhibition of 11βHSD1 by test compounds was assessed in vitro by a Scintillation Proximity<br>
Assay (SPA). Dry test compounds were dissolved at 5 mM in DMSO. These were diluted in DMSO<br>
to suitable concentrations for the SPA assay. 0.8 uL of 2-fold serial dilutions of compounds were<br>
dotted on 384 well plates in DMSO such that 3 logs of compound concentration were covered. 20 uL<br>
of clarified lysate was added to each well. Reactions were initiated by addition of 20 uL of substrate-<br>
cofactor mix in assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) to final<br>
concentrations of 400 pM NADPH, 25 nM 3H-cortisone and 0.007% Triton X-100. Plates were<br>
incubated at 37 °C for one hour. Reactions were quenched by addition of 40 uL of anti-mouse coated<br>
SPA beads that had been pre-incubated with 10 ixM carbenoxolone and a cortisol-specific monoclonal<br>
antibody. Quenched plates were incubated for a minimum of 30 minutes at RT prior to reading on a<br>
Topcount scintillation counter. Controls with no lysate, inhibited lysate, and with no mAb were run<br>
routinely. Roughly 30% of input cortisone is reduced by 11βHSD1 in the uninhibited reaction under<br>
these conditions.<br>
Test compounds having an IC50 value less than about 20 uM according to this assay were<br>
considered active.<br>
Example B<br>
Cell-based assays for HSD activity<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from normal human volunteers<br>
by Ficoll density centrifugation. Cells were plated at 4x105 cells/well in 200 uL of AIM V (Gibco-<br>
BRL) media in 96 well plates. The cells were stimulated overnight with 50 ng/mL recombinant<br>
human IL-4 (R&amp;D Systems). The following morning, 200 nM cortisone (Sigma) was added in the<br>
presence or absence of various concentrations of compound. The cells were incubated for 48 hours<br>
and then supernatants were harvested. Conversion of cortisone to Cortisol was determined by a<br>
commercially available ELISA (Assay Design).<br>
Test compounds having an IC50 value less than about 20 pM according to this assay were<br>
considered active.<br>
Example C<br>
Cellular assay to evaluate MR antagonism<br>
Assays for MR antagonism can be performed essentially as described (Jausons-Loffreda et al.<br>
J Biolumin and Chemilumin, 1994, 9: 217-221). Briefly, HEK293/MSR cells (Invitrogen Corp.) are<br><br>
co-transfected with three plasmids: 1) one designed to express a fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA<br>
binding domain and the mineralocorticoid receptor ligand binding domain, 2) one containing the<br>
GAL4 upstream activation sequence positioned upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene (pFR-<br>
LUC, Stratagene, Inc.), and 3) one containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene cloned downstream<br>
of a thymidine kinase promoter (Promega). Transfections are performed using the FuGENE6 reagent<br>
(Roche). Transfected cells are typically ready for use in subsequent assays 24 hours post-transfection.<br>
In order to evaluate a compound's ability to antagonize the MR, test compounds are diluted in<br>
cell culture medium (E-MEM, 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine) supplemented with 1<br>
nM aldosterone and applied to the transfected cells for 16-18 hours. After the incubation of the cells<br>
with the test compound and aldosterone, the activity of firefly luciferase (indicative of MR agonism<br>
by aldosterone) and Renilla luciferase (normalization control) are determined using the Dual-Glo<br>
Luciferae Assay System (Promega). Antagonism of the mineralocorticoid receptor is determined by<br>
monitoring the ability of a test compound to attenuate the aldosterone-induced firefly luciferase<br>
activity.<br>
Compounds having an IC50 of 100 uM or less are considered active.<br>
