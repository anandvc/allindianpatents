				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a drive device for a drill stem, in particular<br>
adaptable to de-coking systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In oil refineries, the last otherwise unusable fraction of the crude oil is<br>
transformed into coke. This transformation is performed by feeding this fraction<br>
into drums which are filled with coke as the operation proceeds. Once the<br>
maximum filling level of the drums has been reached, the coke is cut out from<br>
the drums.<br>
This so called "de-coking" is usually carried out using high-pressure water jets<br>
which disintegrate the coke and wash it out of the drums. The tool for<br>
generating these high high-pressure water jets is inserted into the drums from<br>
the top using a drilling rig. The subject of the present invention is in particular<br>
the construction of the drill stem drive and therefore the transition from the<br>
water supply to the drill stem.<br>
In prior art generic systems, this transition from the water supply to the drill<br>
stem is formed as an integral feeder. The first, top end is connected to a water<br>
supply via a flange. The second, bottom end of the feeder is connected to the<br>
flange of the drill stem. This second, bottom end is usually supported in thrust<br>
and journal bearing in order to ensure smooth rotation. At the second end of the<br>
feeder there is also a gear box which causes the drill stem to rotate in operation.<br>
The water supply, the feeder and the drill stem are connected in an aligned and<br>
liquid-tight fashion so that a tool attached to the free end of the drill stem for de-<br>
coking is supplied with the requisite water in an operating state.<br>
In the area of the feeder, the sealing rings, which are positioned at the transition<br>
between stationary and rotating structural elements, are particularly subject to<br>
wear and tear and must be replaced at regular intervals. Wear and tear shows at<br>
the first end of the feeder, where a fluid-tight connection is to be established to<br>
the water supply and at the same time fixed and rotating parts of the drive<br>
apparatus are adjacent to each other. In prior art systems, the sealing rings<br>
acting as sealing elements at the transition between fixed and rotating structural<br>
parts must be replaced in the steel frame of the de-coking system while the drill<br>
stem drive is in place, which contributes to maintenance overhead.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to simplify the structure of such<br>
a drive device for a drill stem and to make the replacement of the sealing<br>
elements more maintenance friendly and more economical.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object is achieved by a drive device according to the features of the<br>
invention. A drive device with a feeder comprising first and second sections,<br>
enables faster and error-free replacement. A second section, which extends from<br>
the drill stem and is virtually wear-free, remains in a state securely bolted to the<br>
gearbox and the drill stem. Malfunctions resulting from repeated interference<br>
with these structural elements are thus reliably ruled out.<br>
The first section of the feeder may be released by simple means and is otherwise<br>
connected to the second section in a safe and liquid-tight manner, the<br>
connection, in particular the sealing elements between the first section of the<br>
feeder and the water supply, which is subject to wear and tear, does not have to<br>
be replaced in order to use the drilling apparatus of the present invention. The<br>
type of connection between the water supply and the feeder does not necessarily<br>
have to be changed. All that remains to be done is to replace a compact and<br>
complete assembly.<br>
The advantage of replacing a compact, complete assembly is that the sealing<br>
elements no longer have to be replaced while the drill stem drive is in place and<br>
under spacially difficult conditions. The assembly, comprising the first section of<br>
the feeder of the drill stem drive with the worn out sealing ring, may now be<br>
cleaned and repaired at leisure and provided with new sealing rings. The<br>
repaired assembly is then ready to be reused in a drill stem drive. Since the<br>
attachment to the second section is via a relatively simple connection, the drill<br>
apparatus of the present invention can be repaired in much shorter time.<br>
The drill device is not weakened by partitioning the feeder as long as the type of<br>
connection between the two sections takes the loads into account that have to<br>
be absorbed. In particular it is preferred to design this releasable connection<br>
between the two sections as a clamp, bolt or flange. A clamp connection<br>
preferably provides a means for clamping, connecting the first and the second<br>
section of the feeder. In the same way, a bolting means according to a preferred<br>
embodiment provides a means for bolting which connect the first and second<br>
sections of the feeder. Such connections are known as such, and a person skilled<br>
in the art will be well acquainted with the corresponding approaches.<br>
With drilling apparatus of the prior art, the gear box causing the feeder and the<br>
drill stem to rotate was usually individually manufactured because of the<br>
predominant opinion that this was a special application which required special<br>
measures when designing and adapting the gearbox. The gear boxes of the prior<br>
art are enclosed by a housing filled with oil.<br>
It is to be seen as an autonomous inventive step that the drill device of the<br>
present invention is structurally simplified by the consistent use of standardized<br>
structural parts that are available for a supplier catalogue. By using standardized<br>
parts, the operational safety of the apparatus is usually also increased, since<br>
these parts have already been tested in numerous other applications.<br>
Additionally, the cost of the drill apparatus is advantageously reduced.<br>
It is therefore considered an inventive step to suggest a gear box for drilling<br>
apparatuses, in particular for use in de-coking systems, which is formed as an<br>
open, greased gear rim drive. Surprisingly, such gear boxes, which are known for<br>
swiveling applications, have proven to be sufficiently robust for the use in drilling<br>
apparatuses. The maintenance and repair of such gear boxes is particularly<br>
simple and quick.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
One of the possible embodiments of the invention is described in more detail<br>
with reference to accompanying Figure 1, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a drive device of a drill stem according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Device 2 of the present invention for driving the drill stem comprises a feeder 4<br>
with a first connection 6 to a water supply 8 and a second connection 10 to a<br>
drill stem 12, as well as a drive 14 for a gear box 16 causing feeder 4 and drill<br>
stem 12 to rotate in operation.<br>
Water supply 8, only schematically shown in the figure, is usually formed as a<br>
goose-neck. It ends in a flange 18 at which a first section 20 of the feeder 4<br>
abuts. The connection to the first section 20 is provided by a first interface 6.<br>
Interface 6 has a contacting surface 22 contacting flange 18. In order to make<br>
the connection liquid tight, a standardized seal 24 is provided between interface<br>
6 and flange 18.<br>
Interface 6 is releasably connected to flange 18 by bolts 26, only schematically<br>
shown in the figure. Interface 6 embraces sealing packings 32 surrounding the<br>
first section 20. To counteract the water pressure in feeder 4, packings 32 are<br>
releasably secured by bolts 28 at the bottom through a support 30. In order to<br>
ensure effective sealing between water supply 8, stationary interface 6 and the<br>
first section 20 of feeder 4, which rotates in operation, a plurality of sealing<br>
packings 32 completely fill an annular cavity 34 between interface 6 and first<br>
section 20.<br>
The first section 20 is connected to the second section 40 via a clamp 30<br>
engaging the first section via contacting surfaces 38, 38a. A sealing 42 is<br>
inserted between the two sections 20, 40. Clamp 36 contacts the second section<br>
40 via contacting surfaces 44, 44a. Sections 20, 40 are formed to be planar of<br>
the surfaces 46, 46a facing each other, and on their outer circumferences they<br>
only have the above-described contacting surfaces 38, 38a and 44, 44a. The<br>
manufacture, assembly and disassembly of the first section 20 thus require little<br>
cost and time.<br>
Once the packings 32 are worn out, they have to be replaced. In order for the<br>
replacement to be simple, safe and quick, an assembly comprising first section<br>
20, packings 32 and interface 6 is taken out of drive device 2 after clamp 36 and<br>
interface 6 have been released. An identical assembly provided with new<br>
packings 32 is inserted in drive device 2. Clamp 36 and interface 6 are then<br>
closed again in a sealing relationship. Drive device 2 may put back in operation<br>
after only a short standstill.<br>
The second section 40 is formed to be integral with interface 10, to which gear<br>
16 is attached. A further element of interface 10 is flange 48, to which drill stem<br>
12 is bolted. Bolts 50 are only schematically shown. The circumferential surface<br>
52 of interface 10, that is the end of the second section 40 facing drill stem 12 is<br>
formed as an outer gear rim. A gear rim 54 is in mesh with this outer gear rim<br>
52, wherein gear 54 is caused by drive 14 to rotate in operation.<br>
Drive 14 comprises a motor 56. In the present case, this is an electric motor.<br>
However, hydraulic or pneumatic motors could also be used. A gearbox 58 is<br>
connected downstream of motor 56, wherein the output gear of gearbox 58 is in<br>
mesh with gear 54. Outside gear rim 52, gear 54 and output gear 60 form<br>
gearbox 16. Outside gear rim 52 and gears 54 and 60 are formed to be an open,<br>
greased gearbox 16. A closed gearbox housing is not necessary, and this is why<br>
the need for large quantities of gearbox oil is eliminated. The approach is using<br>
an open gearbox 16 of the present invention is particularly simple and easy to<br>
maintain. It has the additional advantage that outside gear rim 52 does not have<br>
to be specially manufactured for each new feeder 4, which must be regularly<br>
replaced when worn out.<br>
The parts with reference numerals 54, 56, 58 and 60 are all standardized<br>
components as offered in suppliers" catalogues and tested in numerous other<br>
applications.<br>
A thrust bearing 62 and a journal bearing 64 are also positioned in the area of<br>
interface 10, that is at the end facing the second section 40. These bearings 62<br>
and 64 supports the loads applied by gearbox 16 and drive device 2 as well as by<br>
the own weight of the device 2 and ensure smooth rotation of drive device 2<br>
when in an operative state.<br>
To cover feeder 4 rotating in an operating state, drill apparatus 2 has a lantern<br>
66, representing the connection between waster supply 8 and gearbox unit 16.<br>
The drill stem drive is mounted and held by lantern 66. Lantern 66 is simple to<br>
mount and to remove, since it must always be removed when first section 20 of<br>
feeder 4 is to be replaced. It has an access window in the area of packing 32 so<br>
that complex safety is ensured for operating personnel if the state of packings<br>
32, and therefore the degree of wear and tear, has to be checked, which are<br>
sometimes in the immediate vicinity of rotating, high-pressure parts.<br>
In the context, of the present invention, repeated reference has been made to<br>
the use of seals. It is quite obvious that a drilling device transporting water<br>
having a pressure in excess of 100 bars from the water supply to a tool must be<br>
made liquid tight. Seals must therefore be provided in all places that cannot be<br>
made liquid-tight in any other way, regardless of whether or not this has been<br>
mentioned in the above description.<br>
