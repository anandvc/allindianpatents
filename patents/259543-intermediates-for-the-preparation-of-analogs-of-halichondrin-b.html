60/576,642, filed June 3, 2004, 60/626,769, filed November 10, 2004, and 60/663,300 filed March 18, 2005, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]      The present invention relates to compounds useful as intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically active macrolide compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]      The invention relates to pharmaceutically active macrolides, synthesis thereof and intermediates thereto. Halichondrin B is a potent anticancer agent originally isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai, and subsequently found in Axinella sp., Phakellia carteri, and Lissondendryx sp. A total synthesis of Halichondrin B was published in 1992 (Aicher, T. D. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114:3162-3164). Halichondrin B has demonstrated in vitro inhibition of tubulin polymerization, microtubule assembly, betaâ€™-tubulin crosslinldng, GTP and vinblastine binding to tubulin, and tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis and has shown in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer properties. Accordingly, there is a need to develop synthetic methods for preparing analogs of Halichondrin B useful as anti-cancer agents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In a specific illustration of such a replacement, said precursor of a compound of formula F-3 contains a group (for example, a trimethylsilyl group) which is replaced in situ by LG , such as an iodo group. The source of the iodo group may be, e.g., N-iodosuccinimide. Such an in situ generation of a suitable leaving group is well known in the art, e.g., see Id.<br>

4. Assembly of F-l, F-2, and F-3 to Prepare Compound I<br>
[0071]      Coupling of the fragments F-l- and F-2 is accomplished, in general, as set forth in<br>
Scheme VIII below.<br><br>
[0072]      Scheme VIII above shows a general method for preparing intermediate F-5a from fragments F-l and F-2. First, fragments F-l- and F-2- are coupled using methods substantially similar to that described by Kishi, et al, Org Lett 4:25 p 4431 (2002) to afford intermediate F-4, This coupling is performed in the presence of the chiral oxazole (ER-807363) or, alternatively, in the absence of ER-807363. However, the coupling reaction of F-l and F-2 proceeds with higher selectivity when performed in the presence of ER-807363. Intramolecular Williamson ether formation of F-4, by treating F-4 with potassium hexamethyldisilazide, then furnishes tetrahydropyran F-5 as a mixture of stereoisomers. The stereoisomers are then separated to afford F-5a. The details of these steps are set forth in the Examples infra.<br><br>
[0073]      According to another embodiment, the present invention provides a compound F-4: <br>

wherein said compound has the stereochemistry depicted in formula F-4':<br><br>
		1	1<br>
wherein PG1 , PG2 , PG3 , LG1 , and R1 are as defined in general and in subclasses above and<br>
herein.<br>
[0075]      The present invention also provides a compound F-4a:<br><br><br>

pivaloate.<br>
[0076]      Details of the synthesis of F-4a are set forth in the Examples infra.<br>
[0077]     According to yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a compound<br>
F-5: <br>
wherein each PG 5 PG , PG , and R is as defined in general and in subclasses above and<br>
herein.<br>
[0078]      In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a compound of formula F-5<br>
having the stereochemistry as depicted in formula F-55 or F-5a:<br><br><br>
wherein each PG1, PG2, PG3, and R1 is as defined in general and in subclasses above and<br>
herein.<br>
[0079]      The PG3 group of intermediate F-5a is removed and the resulting hydroxyl<br>
compound F-6 is then coupled with a compound F-3a; wherein R3 is CHO, to form F-7 as<br>
depicted in Scheme IX below.<br><br>
[0080]      Scheme IX above shows a general method for preparing an intermediate F-9 from F-3a and F-6. First, the sulfone intermediate F-6 is treated with n-butyl lithium then with the aldehyde F-3a. The resulting diol intermediate F-7 is then oxidized with Dess-Martin reagent to form the ketone-aldehyde intermediate F-8 which is then treated with SmI2 to afford intermediate F-9. The details of these steps are set forth in the Examples infra.<br><br><br>
[0081]      Scheme X above sets forth a general method for preparing the Halichondrin B analogs of the present invention from F-9a (LG is iodo). First, an intramolecular coupling is achieved, by conditions substantially similar to those described at Scheme V above, to form hydroxyl compound F-10. In an alternate method, the intramolecular coupling is performed in the presence of the chiral oxazole ligand, described herein. The addition of the chiral oxazole ligand imparts a higher yield and greater efficiency for the reaction. The details of this reaction are set forth in the Examples below. Compound F-10 is then oxidized to form F-ll. The hydroxyl protecting groups of F-ll are removed by appropriate means to afford F-12. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the methods appropriate to achieve removal of the protecting groups of compound F-ll depend upon the actual protecting groups used and include those described by Greene, For example, when each of the hydroxyl protecting groups of F-ll is a TBS group, such removal may be achieved by treatment with optionally buffered tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The details of these steps are set forth in the Examples infra.<br>
[0082]      Intermediate F-12 is useful for preparing various analogs of Halichondrin B as described in, e.g. United States Patent 6,365,759 and United States Patent 6,469,182 the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>

[00108]      The enantiomers of ER-806909 were separated using the above protocol in the following manner. For an 11 hour run, 10 L of 36 g/L ER-806909 in mobile phase was pumped (Silog model Chemtech) through a 142 mm diameter 0.45 Âµm pore size nylon filter (Cole-Parmer # 2916-48) and into the Feed tank. The Eluant tank was filled with 36L mobile phase that has been filtered through an in-line 45 mm diameter 1 Âµm glass fiber filter (Whatman GFC), additional vol. were added throughout the run. The internal temperature of the SMB apparatus was adjusted to 27 Â°C.<br>
[00109]      For initial startup, the Feed and Eluant inlets were both connected to (he Eluant tank. The Feed and Eluant pumps were primed and purged with mobile phase solvent. The SMB apparatus column switching was initiated, the pumps were turned on and the flow rates were gradually increased to full speed wliile maintaining absolute flow rate differences between each pump. Once full speed was achieved the Raffinate and Extract flow rates were measured and adjustments to pump flow rates were made to correct for deviations in pump specifications. The Feed pump (Pump 1) was reduced to 0 mL/min, the inlet reconnected to the Feed tank, the pump primed with Feed solution and then the flow rate gradually increased back to full operating speed. The Raffinate and Extract outlets were collected into separate tanks and samples of each of each were acquired every 2 hours. The samples were monitored for chiral purity by analytical HPLC using the HPLC method set forth below. Adjustments to the flow rates of Pumps 2, 3 and 4 as well as to the tact time were made to afford the desired outlet purities.<br>
[00110]      At the end of the run, the Feed pump was once again reduced to zero flow rate and connected to the Eluant tank. The Feed pump was brought back to full speed and the system was allowed to wash for 20 minutes. The Raffinate and Extract outlets were maintained for 10 minutes (10 tacts) during the wash period and, for the remainder of the wash, the outlets were collected into a separate tank. The column wash was eventually concentrated and added to the Feed on subsequent runs.<br>
[00111]      The collected Extract (ER-806721) at the end of each run was pooled with material collected from the same starting material lot and the final pooled lot was analyzed again for chiral purity by the analytical HPLC method described in Table 1 below. The same procedure was applied to the collected Raffinate (ER-808373).<br><br>

The system was washed until the UV and RI detectors achieved a stable baseline. The RI detector reference flow cell was flushed with fresh mobile phase.<br>
[00124]      Chromatography of 8 g injections of ER-807527 was accomplished by diluting the current lot of ER-807527 to a concentration of 0.8 g/mL in the mobile phase. Injecting 10 mL aliquots of the dissolved material and collecting the eluant corresponding to the ER-806730 peak approximately beginning at the peak apex approximately 24 minutes and continuing to 35 minutes. Subsequent injections and fraction collection were continued until the starting material is exhausted.<br>
