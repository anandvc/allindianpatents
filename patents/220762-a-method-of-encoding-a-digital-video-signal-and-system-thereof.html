				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1         Technical Field<br>
The inventive arrangements relate generally to video systems and more on f'cularly to video systems that record or play back digitally encoded video<br>
i unices ?         Description of Related Art<br>
'"'•'; 'hat facilitate the playback of video are gaining popularity in today's<br>
- ;ui .,,L,x.iiomcs marketplace.  For example, many consumers have purchased digital video disc (DVD) recorders or players for purposes of viewing previously recorded programs or recording their favorite programs. A DVD recorder or player typically contains a Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) decoder to decode the digitally encoded multimedia data that is stored on the discs that the recorder or player plays. The MPEG video signal to be decoded is comprised of a plurality of jrc uos of pictures (GOP), each of which typically contain an intra (I) picture, a .••&gt;:• ility of predictive (P) pictures and a plurality of bidirectional predictive (B) pit. ;ures,<br>
During playback of a video signal, some viewers may wish to perform certain tricK modes. A trick mode can be any playback of video in which the playback is not done at normal speed or in a forward direction. As an example, a fast-forward trick TK oe can be initiated to allow the viewer to move through portions of video rather quicKly. To effectuate a fast-forward trick mode on an MPEG video signal, the decoder of the DVD may skip a number of pictures in each GOP of the video signal. The faster the trick mode, the greater the number of pictures in each GOP that need to be skipped. Generally, the B pictures are skipped first in successive GOPs until none of them remain, followed by the P pictures until they are exhausted as well. With respect to the P pictures, it is necessary to skip first the P picture at the end of the GOP (this is typically the last picture in display order in a GOP) followed by the immediate prior P picture in display order. This process may continue such that the i' i i Jure to be skipped is the last P picture in the GOP (in display order) until no P<br><br>
pictures remain. If desired, the I picture may also be skipped, at which point the entire GOP is skipped.<br>
The principle behind this particular algorithm, in which B pictures are skipped first and P pictures are skipped next in view of their display order, is based on the prediction schemes employed in a typical GOP. Specifically, B pictures are not used to predict other pictures, and it is useful to skip them for a moderate or lower speed-up. In contrast, the I picture is used, both directly and indirectly, to predict all the other pictures in the GOP; if it is the only I picture in the GOP, it must be retained if any of the other pictures in the GOP are not skipped. If the I picture were to be skipped without skipping any of the other pictures, it would be impossible to accurately predict any of the remaining pictures. Similarly, P pictures are used to predict other P pictures and skipping a P picture other than the currently last P picture in the GOP would adversely affect the display of any pictures that follow in display order the skipped P picture.<br>
Although acceptable, the algorithm described above necessitates additional microprocessor programming to conform to the particular order in which pictures are to be skipped. In addition, this skipping algorithm does not permit pictures to be skipped to produce an optimal playback. For example, if a viewer wished to play video back at twice the normal playback speed, the most desirable way to skip pictures in the video would be to skip every other picture. In a typical GOP structure, however, skipping pictures in this manner is unavailable because of the limitations described above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns a method of encoding a digital video signal. The method can include the steps of receiving a progressive video signal and encoding the progressive video signal into at least one group of pictures having at least one prediction source picture and at least one non-prediction source picture. All the non-prediction source pictures are predicted from the prediction source picture such that no non-prediction source picture is predicted from another non-prediction source picture.<br>
In addition, the method can include the steps of recording the progressive viooo signal to a storage medium and playing back the progressive video signal. The method can also include the step of, in response to a forward trick mode command, modifying at least the number of non-prediction source pictures in the group of pictures to convert the progressive video signal to a trick mode video signal.<br>
In one arrangement, the prediction source picture can be an intra picture. rurther, at least a portion of the non-prediction source pictures can be bidirectional 3redictive pictures or predictive pictures. As an example, each of the bidirectional predictive pictures can be one-directional bidirectional predictive pictures.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the modifying step can include the step of skipping at least one non-prediction source picture in the group of pictures to convert the progressive video signal to a trick mode video signal. Alternatively, the nodifying step can include the step of inserting in the group of pictures a duplicate of at least one non-prediction source picture to convert the progressive video signal to a trick mode video signal.<br>
In another aspect, the skipped non-prediction source picture can be a predictive picture being the last picture in display order in the group of pictures. In addition, the method can further include the step of converting an immediate prior non-prediction source picture in display order in the group of pictures into a predictive picture unless the immediate prior non-prediction source picture is a predictive picture.<br>
In another arrangement, each of the prediction source picture and the non-prediction source pictures can contain a display indicator, and the method can further include the step of modifying the display indicator of at least a portion of the<br>
prediction source pictures and non-prediction source pictures to reflect an intended display order. As an example, the display indicator can be a temporal reference field.<br>
The present invention also concerns a system for encoding a digital video signal. The system includes a processor for encoding a progressive video signal into at least one group of pictures having at least one prediction source picture and af 'east one non-prediction source picture. All the non-prediction source pictures arc predicted from the prediction source picture such that no non-prediction source picture is predicted from another non-prediction source picture. In addition, the sy item includes a decoder for decoding the progressive video signal. The system also includes suitable software and circuitry to implement the methods as described<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A system 100 for implementing the various advanced operating features in accordance with the inventive arrangements is shown in block diagram form in FIG. 1A. The invention, however, is not limited to the particular system illustrated in FIG. 1 A, as the invention can be practiced with any other system capable of receiving a video signal, processing the signal and outputting the signal to any suitable component, such as a display device. In addition, the system 100 is not limited to reading data from or writing data to any particular type of storage medium, as any storage medium capable of storing digitally encoded data can be used with the system 100.<br>
The system 100 can include an encoder 110 for encoding an incoming video signal, and a microprocessor 112 for instructing the encoder 110 to encode the video signal in accordance with various techniques, some of which will be explained later  All or portions of the encoder 110 and the microprocessor 112 can be considered a processor 114 within contemplation of the present invention. The encoder 110 can be located in the same apparatus as the microprocessor 112 or, alternatively, can be positioned in a device that is remote from the apparatus housing the microprocessor 112. If the encoder 110 is remotely located, the encoder 110 is not necessarily under the control of the microprocessor 112.<br>
The system 100 can also include a controller 116 for reading data from and writing data to a storage medium 118. For example, the data can be a digitally rjruAided video signal. The system 100 can also have a decoder 120 for decoding the encoded video signal when it is read from the storage medium 118 and transferring the decoded video signal to a suitable component, such as a display device, The decoder 120 can be mounted in the same apparatus containing the " • -(«- 110 (if the encoder 110 is rot rernot^' ' -cFtern the microprocessor -MO ^I,L. .He ouiiifoiltsi 116 or, as will be described beiow, may be mounted in a separate device.<br>
Control and data interfaces can also be provided for permitting the microprocessor 112 to control the operation of the encoder 110 (as noted above), the controller 116 and the decoder 120. Suitable software or firmware can be provided in memory for the conventional operations performed by the<br>
microprocessor 112. Further, program routines can be provided for the microprocessor 112 in accordance with the inventive arrangements<br>
in operation, the encoder 110 can receive and encode an incoming progressive video signal. As is known in the art, this type of video signal is comprised of pictures that have been progressively scanned. In accordance with the inventive arrangements, the microprocessor 112 can instruct the encoder 110 to encode the incoming video signal into one or more GOPs that are particularly useful lor .informing trick modes. Examples of such GOPs will be presented below. The L-p.corier 110 can then transfer the encoded video signal to the controller 116, which can record the signal onto the storage medium 118. In the case where the encoder 110 is remotely located, the encoder 110 can encode the incoming non-progressive video signal, but the encoding instructions are not necessarily received from the microprocessor 112.<br>
If the microprocessor 112 receives a playback command, the microprocessor 112 can instruct the controller 116 to read the encoded video signal from the storage medium 118. The controller 118 can transfer the signal to the microprocessor 112, which can send the signal to the decoder 120. The decoder 120 can decode the video signal and output the signal for display on a suitable device. If the microprocessor 112 receives a trick mode command, the microprocessor 112 can skip pictures in the GOPs or repeat the pictures of the GOPs.<br>
As alluded to earlier, there may be some instances in which the decoder 120 thai performs the decoding step is located in a device separate from the apparatus containing the microprocessor 112. An example of such an arrangement is illustrated in FIG. 1B in which the decoder 120 is in a display device 122, separate from a multimedia device 124 that can house the microprocessor 112. In this case, the decoder 120 may not be under the control of the microprocessor 112. Such a system can be referred to as a remote decoder system. Nonetheless, trick modes may still be performed in this system 100 in which the microprocessor 112 may delete pictures or insert duplicates of the pictures in the video signal prior to being decoded by the decoder 120 in the display device 122. It is understood that the encoder 110 in this type of system may be remotely located as well.<br>
In either of the arrangements discussed in relation to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the GOPs created during the encoding process will facilitate efficient implementation of a forward trick mode. The overall operation of the invention will be discussed in detail below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a method 200 that demonstrates one way to perform a tnok mode on a progressive video signal using special GOPs is illustrated. The :•
Referring to FIG. 3, an example of such a process is shown. In this particular arrangement, the video signal can be encoded into one or more GOPs 300. The GOPs 300 are shown in display order. Each of the GOPs 300 can include at least one prediction source picture 310 and at least one non-prediction-source picture 312. A prediction source picture is a picture in a GOP that is not predicted from another picture yet can be used to predict other pictures in the GOP. In addition, a non-prediction source picture can be any picture in a GOP that can be predicted from a prediction source picture in that GOP.<br>
As an example, the prediction source picture 310 can be an I picture, and the non-prediction source pictures 312 can be B and/or P pictures. Each of the non-prediction source pictures 312 can be predicted from the prediction source picture ,i'l(), which in this example correlates to each of the B and P pictures being<br>
the I picture,  Because P oictures ~an serve as non-prediction source<br>

' !(i only. In one arrangement, the B pictures can be one-directional prediction pictures such that the B pictures prior to, or in front of, the I picture (in display order) can be backward predicted from the I picture, and the B pictures behind the I picture (in display order) can be forward predicted from the I picture. The subscript numbers incorporated into the prediction source pictures 310 and the non-prediction source pictures 312 can indicate the order in which each of these pictures will be displayed - relative to the other pictures in the GOP - at a normal playback speed.<br>
As noted earlier, the GOP 300 is shown in display order. The transmission order is slightly different in that the prediction source picture 310, in this example picture b, can be transmitted to a decoder first followed by the non-prediction source pictures 312 that will be predicted from the prediction source picture 310.<br>
It is important to note that the invention is in no way limited to these particular GOPs 300, as they represent merely one example of a GOP structure in accordance with the inventive arrangements. In fact, any GOP in which all the non-prediction source pictures in the GOP can be predicted from a prediction source picture in that GOP is within contemplation of the inventive arrangements. Moreover, although only two GOPs 300 are shown in FIG. 3 in which each GOP 300 has one prediction source picture 310 and six non-prediction source pictures 312, it is understood that the received video signal can be encoded into any suitable number of GOPs 300 having any suitable number of prediction source pictures 310 and non-prediction source pictures 312.<br>
Also, if more than one prediction source picture 310 is in the GOP 300, any B<br>
one orediction source picture 310 can be positioned in the GOP 300 and some of the non-prediction source pictures 312 can be predicted from these prediction source pictures 310. As such, the prediction source pictures 310 can be transmitted to a decoder before the non-prediction source pictures 312 that are dependent on these prediction source pictures 310 for their prediction.<br>
Referring back to method 200, at step 215, the progressive video signal ..... «.     n^n- rnr f-)0 rororr)r&gt;d onto i p; ijinh'^ c;tpraqfi medium    OHCP<br>

..... ...^...w^uw/, wj.i bo performed in response lo a forward trick mode command,<br>
such as fast-forward or slow-forward. If no modification is to occur, the method 200 can resume at step 216. If it is, then such a process can be performed at step 218. The operation conducted at step 218 can convert the progressive video signal to a trick mode video signal. Several examples are shown in FIGS. 4A-4D.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4A, each of the GOPs 300, as first illustrated in FIG. 3, is shown with several non-prediction source pictures 312 removed or skipped. Specifically, pictures BO, B2, B4 and P6 in the GOP 300 on the left can be skipped, while pictures B-i, 84 and Pe in the GOP 300 on the right can be skipped. Skipping such non-prediction source pictures 312 can cause the playback speed to increase. Here, the number of non-prediction source pictures 312 skipped, one-half of all the pictures in the two GOPs 300, correlates to a playback speed that is twice the speed of normal playback, or 2X (1X represents normal playback speed).<br>
In accordance with the inventive arrangements, any one of the non-prediction source pictures 312 in the GOPs 300 can be skipped to increase the playback speed of the video signal without affecting the prediction of any remaining non-prediction source pictures 312 in the GOPs 300. This feature is made possible by the encoding process described above. A step for placing the GOPs 300 in accordance with the MPEG standard, for example, will be discussed later.<br>
Of course, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the example described in relation to FIG. 4A, as the ability to skip all non-prediction source pictures 312 applies to any other GOP in which the non-prediction source pictures 312 are predicted from a prediction source picture 310. Also, the entire GOP 300 may be skipped to produce a faster playback.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2, the modifying step 218 can also include the step of inserting in the GOP 300 a duplicate of at least one prediction source picture 310 or non-prediction source picture 312 to convert the progressive video signal to a trick mode video signal. An example of such an operation is shown in FIG. 4B. Here, a duplicate of each prediction source picture 310 and non-prediction source picture 312 can be inserted into the GOP 300 (for convenience, only one GOP 300 from FIG. 3 is shown). This particular example can produce a playback speed of 1/zX. The subscript letter "d" represents the picture to which it is associated as a duplicate of the immediate preceding picture.<br>
Similar to the original non-prediction source pictures 312, the duplicates of such pictures can be predicted from a prediction source picture 310 (in accordance with the MPEG standard, the last picture in the GOP 300, duplicate picture P6d, can be predicted from the immediate prior P picture, which in this case is picture Pe). In addition, the original non-prediction pictures 312 and their duplicates may be predicted from the duplicate of a prediction source picture 310.<br>
The example presented in FIG. 4B is explained as follows: all the non-prediction source pictures 312 and their duplicates in front (in display order) of the original prediction source picture 310, or picture b. may be predicted from picture la. Additionally, the original non-prediction source pictures 312 and their duplicates behind (in display order) the duplicate of the original prediction source picture 310, or picture bd, may be predicted from duplicate picture 13d (with the exception of duplicate picture Red). It is understood, however, that this particular arrangement is merely an example, as the non-prediction source pictures 312 and their duplicates can be predicted from any other suitable prediction source picture 310, including any duplicate of a prediction source picture 310.<br>
In another arrangement, one or more of the duplicate pictures inserted in the GOP 300 can be dummy B or dummy P pictures. A dummy B or a dummy P picture is a B or P picture, respectively, in which the dummy picture's motion vectors are set to zero and its residual signal is set to zero or not encoded. For example, the duplicate of the prediction source picture 310 (picture b) in the GOP 300 can be a 'dummy P picture instead of another I picture, such as picture bd- Similarly, the duplicate for the last non-prediction picture 312 (picture Pe) can be a dummy P picture rather than a conventional P picture, such as picture Red- Using dummy B or P pictures during a trick mode can lower the bit rate of the video signal, which may be necessary in certain circumstances.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2, at decision block 220, it can be determined whether the last non-prediction source picture in the GOP has been skipped. If no, the method 200 can resume at decision block 226 through jump circle A. If yes, it can be determined at decision block 222 whether the immediate prior non-prediction source picture in display order in the GOP is a P picture. If it is, the method 200 can cjMiihue at decision block 226 through jump circle A. If it is not, then the immediate<br>
prior non-prediction source picture in the GOP can be converted into a P picture, as<br>
i in it. operation is illustrated in FIG. 4C. The specifications for MPEG video require that the last picture in a GOP be a P picture or an I picture. Thus, if picture P6 in the GOP 300, a non-prediction source picture 312, were skipped during a trick mode, the last picture in the GOP 300 (if it is not skipped) would be picture 85, a violation of the MPEG standard. To satisfy the MPEG requirement, the immediate prior non-prediction source picture 312, in this case, picture 65, can be converted into a P picture, or picture PS.<br>
A B picture can be converted into a P picture by setting to P picture values the following parameters located in the picture header of the B picture: picture_coding_type; full_pel_backward_vector; and backward_f_code. Additionally, the following variable length codes for macroblock_type can be set to P picture values: macroblock_quant; macroblock_motion_forward; macroblock_motion_backward; macroblock_pattern; macroblock_intra; spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag; and permitted spatial_temporal_weight_classes.<br>
This process can instruct a decoder to decode the picture as a P picture. As such, in accordance with the inventive arrangements, the last picture in a GOP 300 can be skipped without violating the MPEG requirement that the last picture in a GOP be a P picture. As another example, referring to FIG. 4A, picture B5 in both 30Ps 300 can be converted to a P picture to conform to the MPEG standard.<br>
Referring back to the method 200 of FIG. 2, the prediction source pictures and the non-prediction source pictures can contain a display indicator. As determined at decision block 226 from jump circle A, if the display indicators of<br>
n-t'n? gre to be modified, then such a process can be performed at step 228. Notably, modifying these display indicators can reflect an intended display order of the prediction source pictures and non-prediction source pictures when any one of these pictures is skipped or duplicated. If the display indicators are not to be modified, then the method 200 can stop at step 230.<br>
In one arrangement, the display indicator can be a temporal reference field. A temporal reference field is typically a ten bit field located in the picture header of .:;.-;•-• n,, ^n^^r1 nirttires. Some decoders rely on the temporal reference field to<br>
determine when a particular picture in a video signal will be displayed relative to other pictures in the video signal. This field normally has an integer value.<br>
As an example, referring once again to FIG. 3, each GOP 300 contains seven pictures. The subscript numbers for the pictures in each GOP 300 can correspond to the integer values for each respective picture's temporal reference field. For instance, the temporal reference field of the first non-prediction source picture 312, or picture B0, can have an integer value of zero, which indicates that this particular picture will be the first one in each GOP 300 to be displayed. The temporal reference field of picture 81, the next picture to be displayed, can have an integer value of one. Thus, the integer value of the temporal reference field for each '.•••K. - :&gt;quent picture to be displayed can be higher by one, all the way to picture P6, ^ temporal reference field can have an integer value of 6. For convenience, the phrase "integer value of the temporal reference field" can also be referred to as '"integer value."<br>
When, for example, a non-prediction source picture 312 is skipped, however, the display order according to the original temporal reference fields is no longer valid. Accordingly, the integer value of the temporal reference fields of the prediction source pictures 310 and the non-prediction source pictures 312 that follow the skipped picture can be modified to indicate a proper display order. This feature is also applicable if duplicates of the prediction source pictures 310 or the non-prediction source pictures 312 are inserted in the GOP 300.<br>
As an example, if picture B-i in the GOP 300 on the right is skipped, then the integer values of the prediction source pictures 310 and the non-prediction source pictures 312 that follow this picture can be decreased by a value of one. So, the integer value of the'temporal reference field of picture B2 can be modified from two to one, the integer value of the temporal reference field of picture (3 can be modified from three to two and so on. This modification process can continue until the end of the GOP 300 is reached and can ensure that the remaining pictures in the GOP 300 will be displayed in a proper order.<br>
Thus, each time a prediction source picture 310 or a non-prediction source picture 312 in a GOP is skipped, the integer values of the temporal reference fields of the remaining pictures in that GOP that follow the skipped picture can be decreased by a value of one. The end result is illustrated in FIG. 4D, where the new<br>
integer values are shown, the skipped picture B-i is represented by a dashed outline and the old integer values are in parentheses. In a similar fashion, each time a duplicate of a prediction source picture 31" or a non-prediction source picture 312 is inserted in a GOP 300, the integer values of the pictures that follow the inserted duplicates can be increased by a value of one.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not limited to these particular examples, as other ways to modify the integer values of the relevant temporal reference fields to reflect an intended display order can be performed in any other suitable fashion. Moreover, it should be noted that the invention is not limited to the use of a temporal reference field, as any other suitable display indicator can be modified to reflect an intended display order in either of the embodiments discussed above. Referring back to FIG. 2, the method 200 can stop at step 230.<br>
