				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for operating a vapor compression refrigeration system and a vapor compression refrigeration system and, more particularly, to vapor compression refrigeration, freezer and air conditioning systems. In this regard, an important aspect of the present invention concerns improvements in the efficiency of vapor compression refrigeration systems which are advantageously suited for use in commercial medium and low temperature refrigeration/freezer applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vapor compression refrigeration systems typically employ a fluid refrigerant medium that is directed through various phases or states to attain successive heat exchange functions. These systems generally employ a compressor which receives refrigerant in a vapor state (typically in the form of a super heated vapor) and compresses that vapor to a higher pressure which is then supplied to a condenser wherein a cooling medium comes into indirect contact with the incoming high pressure vapor, removing latent heat from the refrigerant and issuing liquid refrigerant at or below its boiling point corresponding to the condensing pressure. This refrigerant liquid is then fed to an expansion device, for example, an expansion valve or capillary tube, which effects a controlled reduction<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vapor compression refrigeration method and apparatus characterized by reduced power consumption and cost of operation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vapor compression refrigeration method and apparatus having improved heat transfer efficiency and reduced refrigerant charge requirements, enabling in many applications the elimination of traditional components such as, for example, a receiver in the refrigeration circuit.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vapor compression refrigeration method and apparatus wherein the temperature differential between the cooling coils and air circulated in heat exchange relationship therewith is minimized, resulting in substantially reduced extraction of the water content in that air and the maintenance of more uniform humidity levels in refrigeration cases and freezer compartments associated therewith.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a commercial refrigeration system wherein the compressor, expansion device and condenser can be remotely located from the refrigeration or freezer compartment associated therewith, thereby facilitating the servicing of those components without interference with customer traffic and the like.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vapor compression refrigeration system wherein the compressor, expansion device and condenser, together with their associated controls, are contained as a group in a compact housing which can be easily installed in a refrigeration circuit.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for operating a vapor compression refrigeration system, wherein an evaporator removes heat from a medium which is circulated through said evaporator in heat exchange relation with an evaporator coil in said evaporator, said evaporator coil comprising an inlet which is in flow communication with an expansion device and an outlet which is in flow communication with a compressor, the method comprising the steps of: compressing a refrigerant fluid in said compressor; condensing said refrigerant fluid in a condenser to form a condensed refrigerant fluid; expanding said condensed refrigerant fluid in said expansion device to form an expanded refrigerant fluid, wherein said expanded refrigerant fluid is in a liquid form or substantially in said liquid form with a small vapor fraction; supplying said expanded refrigerant to an evaporator feed line connecting said expansion device to said<br><br>
evaporator coil inlet; converting a significant amount of said liquid form to a liquid and vapor mixture within said evaporator feed line, wherein the diameter and length of said evaporator feed line facilitates said conversion; supplying said mixture of refrigerant vapor and liquid to said evaporator coil inlet, said mixture comprising a substantial vapor portion; and converting substantially all of said liquid to vapor as said mixture passes through said evaporator coil, whereby efficient heat transfer is provided between said mixture and said medium along substantially the entire length of said coil, and whereby the build-up of frost on said evaporator coil is substantially reduced.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a vapor compression refrigeration system, comprising: a compressor for increasing the pressure and temperature of a refrigerant vapor, said compressor having an inlet and an outlet; a condenser having an inlet in flow communication with the outlet of said compressor for liquefying pressurized refrigerant vapor received from said compressor; an expansion device having a first inlet which, during a cooling mode of operation of said refrigeration system, is in flow communication with an outlet of said condenser for receiving liquid refrigerant from said condenser and vaporizing a substantial portion of the same, and wherein said first inlet of said expansion device is in proximity with said outlet of said condenser; an evaporator comprising an evaporating coil having an inlet and an outlet, said evaporating coil being in heat exchange relation with a medium along substantially the entire length of said coil; an evaporator feed line providing flow communication of said expansion device with said evaporating coil inlet; a suction line providing flow communication of said evaporating coil outlet with said compressor inlet; said expansion device and said evaporator feed line, during a cooling mode of operation of said vapor compression refrigeration system, being sized to provide said evaporating coil inlet with a refrigerant liquid and vapor mixture that comprises a substantial vapor portion; and said evaporating coil being sized to provide said refrigerant liquid and vapor mixture with a linear velocity sufficient to provide efficient heat transfer along substantially the entire length of said coil.<br>
