				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement comprising at least one high electrostatic<br>
potential electrode which e.g. may have substantially sharp edges. Particularly the high<br>
potential electrode is adapted to be exposed to a high potential or it is an electrode<br>
intentionally or unintentionally exposed to a high electrostatic field producing a high<br>
potential. The invention also relates to use of the arrangement in for example a<br>
ferroelectric device such as for example a phase shifter, a filter, a matching circuit, an<br>
antenna, a controllable antenna, a power splitter or similar.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
For high voltage arrangements in general the design of the electrodes is extremely<br>
important. If they are not designed properly or located properly, there is a high risk for<br>
arching in the air around the electrodes, discharging, and for example dielectric break-<br>
down in surrounding materials or substrate materials carrying the electrodes. If dielectric<br>
materials are carrying the electrodes, a dielectric break-down may occur in the substrate<br>
material. Air as a surrounding material for example supports about 3-5V/um. For so<br>
called planar electrodes the situation is particularly troublesome since a high voltage on<br>
planar electrodes gives rise to high peak-fields near the edges. If the electrodes are located<br>
at an interface between two materials with different or very dissimilar permittivities, the<br>
peak-fields will typically be even higher.<br>
Different solutions have been proposed to solve the problems referred to above. According<br>
to one approach high voltage electrodes are encapsulated in silicone so that there will be<br>
no air in the immediate vicinity of the electrode edges. However, if electrodes are'<br>
provided on a dielectric substrate or a dielectric layer, silicone encapsulation will provide<br>
for an increase in the dielectric strength above the substrate, but it has no effect inside the<br>
substrate. According to another approach, the device is immersed in an isolation fluid, but<br>
such a solution suffers from the same disadvantages as encapsulation in silicone.<br>
According to a third approach, large isolation distances between the electrodes are used.<br>
This may of course reduce the fields, and it will give a larger creep distance for the<br>
current. However, in many cases large fields are desirable in order for example to provide<br>
2<br><br>
a good performance of the arrangement and this inevitably leads to strong fields near the<br>
electrodes in any case.<br>
Still further, another solution is suggested according to which all constituent parts,<br>
particularly the electrodes, are made as round as possible, i.e. they are rounded and it is<br>
tried to avoid sharp edges. In principle this is an attractive solution since the fields are<br>
reduced. However, in many cases it is very difficult and expensive to fabricate rounded<br>
electrodes. In addition thereto, in cases when the electrodes are provided on dielectric<br>
layers, when the permittivity of the dielectric layer or the substrate is very high, it will be<br>
necessary to insert the rounded electrodes half way into the dielectric layer substrate if the<br>
rounding is to have a positive effect on the peak fields (in ferroelectric devices allowing<br>
controllability of the dielectric constant by means of for example a controlled applied<br>
voltage, the permittivity is typically in the range of 100-3000 although it may also be<br>
much higher, e.g. up to 20000).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore an arrangement as initially referred to through which the risk<br>
of arching, discharging, and dielectric break-down (if applicable) around the high potential<br>
or high voltage electrodes can be reduced or eliminated. Particularly an arrangement is<br>
needed through which singularities in the field produced around high potential electrodes<br>
can be suppressed or reduced. Particularly high voltage arrangements are needed through<br>
which the peak-fields around or associated with sharp edge electrodes can be reduced, but<br>
also for cases when rounded electrodes are not inserted to some extent into a dielectric<br>
material as discussed above. Further yet an arrangement is needed wherein high peak-<br>
fields, dischargings etc. can be avoided particularly for planar implementations with planar<br>
electrodes and planar substrates and/or electrically controllable layers. Even more<br>
particularly an arrangement as initially referred to is needed through which peak-fields etc.<br>
can be suppressed or reduced and dielectric break-down can be prevented when the<br>
electrodes are provided on a dielectric substrate material, where the substrate material can<br>
be electrically controllable. Particularly an arrangement as initially referred to is needed<br>
which is electrically controllable through the application of an electrostatic field, e.g. by<br>
variation of the dielectric constant of a ferroelectric material, through which the above<br>
mentioned disadvantages can be reduced or eliminated to a high extent. Particularly a high<br>
3<br><br>
voltage arrangement is needed in which peak-fields and field singularities etc. can be<br>
reduced even if applying a high electro-static field (intentionally, but also for unintentional<br>
exposure).<br>
Particularly it is an object of the present invention to provide an arrangement through<br>
which it gets possible to set up an electrostatic field which is as high as possible in<br>
ferroelectric devices without facing reliability problems among others due to dielectric<br>
break-down in a ferroelectric material. Particularly it is an object to prevent peak-fields<br>
irrespectively of whether a high voltage is applied voluntarily or involuntarily, i.e. to<br>
provide a solution to the problems produced by high electrostatic fields in general. Most<br>
particularly it is an object to provide an arrangement wherein the electrodes are placed at<br>
an interface between two materials with dissimilar permittivities through which peak-<br>
fields can be reduced to a high extent. Particularly an arrangement is needed through<br>
which, in case the electrodes are provided on a dielectric substrate, the produced fields can<br>
be affected, and reduced, also inside the substrate in order to protect the substrate, or the<br>
ferroelectric layer, when the arrangement, or the electrodes are exposed to a high<br>
electrostatic field. An arrangement is also needed which supports application of large<br>
electric fields in order to provide a good performance. Furthermore an arrangement is<br>
needed which is easy to fabricate and which is reliable. Particularly it is an object to be<br>
able to build components such as controllable antennas, phase shifters, filters, impedance<br>
matching networks, power splitters etc. which support high fields, are resistant to ageing,<br>
are reliable and particularly are electrically controllable or tunable.<br>
Therefore an arrangement as initially referred to is provided with at least one low potential<br>
electrode means, or at least one electrode means having a potential which is such in<br>
relation to said at least one high potential electrode (in absolute value (+/-)) or relative to a<br>
reference potential or background (e.g. ground) potential, that the potential will be<br>
balanced, said low potential or balancing electrode means being disposed at a distance<br>
from said at least one high potential electrode or at least partly surrounding said at least<br>
one high potential electrode, and at least one resistive arrangement connecting each said<br>
high potential electrode with each respective adjacent low or balancing potential electrode,<br>
whereby said resistive arrangement has a low conductivity which however still is non-<br>
isolating, such that a substantially linear voltage drop is provided between said high<br>
4<br><br>
potential electrode or electrodes and said low or balancing potential electrode or electrodes<br>
in order to suppress peak-fields or field singularities near the (possibly sharp) edges of the<br>
high potential electrodes.<br>
In a particularly advantageous implementation the high potential electrode or electrodes<br>
are disposed on a dielectric layer with a variable dielectric constant allowing for<br>
electrically controlling or tuning of the arrangement. According to the invention,<br>
particularly the high potential electrode or electrodes, the low (or balancing) potential<br>
electrode or electrodes and the resistive film arrangement are provided on a ferroelectric<br>
layer, i.e. a dielectric layer with a variable and hence tunable or controllable dielectric<br>
constant. In such an embodiment the arrangement particularly comprises, or is connected<br>
to, an electric control means, comprising a voltage generating means or applying means<br>
adapted to apply an electric field to the ferroelectric layer in order to control or tune the<br>
dielectric constant.<br>
In one embodiment at least the high potential electrode or electrodes are planar electrodes,<br>
in the sense that they are provided on a, at least locally, flat surface and where at least one<br>
electrode dimension is very thin compared to the other two, or one. If the high potential<br>
electrodes are provided on a ferroelectric material, i.e. a dielectric material with a variable<br>
dielectric constant, this ferroelectric material may comprises a ceramic material, for<br>
example a BST (Barium Strontium Titanate) material or a material with similar properties.<br>
In one implementation a ground electrode is provided on a side of the ferroelectric layer<br>
which is opposite to the side on which the high and low (balancing) potential electrodes<br>
are arranged. If the low or balancing potential electrode is not a ground electrode it is<br>
particularly at least an electrode having a potential which differs considerably from that of<br>
the high potential electrode or electrodes. The arrangement may comprise one, two or<br>
more high potential electrodes. If there are at least two high potential electrodes they may<br>
have the same potential but also different potentials, differing to a small extent or to a very<br>
large extent, or anything therebetween.<br>
According to the invention the resistive arrangement may comprise a high resistivity film.<br>
The resistive arrangement, particularly the high resistivity film, but actually independently<br>
of which is the resistive arrangement, it can have different values of the (sheet) resistance<br>
5<br><br>
for different applications, but a value in the range 1-10.000 MOhm/square should be<br>
adequate in most applications. In one implementation the resistive arrangement has a<br>
resistivity of about 50-150, particularly about 100 MOhm/square.<br>
Particularly the resistivity of the material that is selected to be used in the resistive<br>
arrangement can be limited downwards by requirements concerning maximum power<br>
consumption and/or maximum allowable heating of the arrangement, at the maximum<br>
voltage to be used, and/or requirements as to transmissibility of microwaves, for some<br>
microwave implementations, and particularly it can be limited upwards by requirements as<br>
to fast reaction times at high voltages. It should be clear that the resistivity can be selected<br>
without being limited downwards/upwards as discussed above.<br>
In particular implementations the resistive arrangement may consist of SrTi03 and<br>
LaMn03 films.<br>
In some implementations the arrangement may comprise a thin film arrangement, i.e.<br>
produced using thin-film technology. In other implementations it may comprise an<br>
arrangement for example using "thick films" or a three-dimensional arrangement, where<br>
instead of a virtually two-dimensional film, a three-dimensional filling with a high, but<br>
finite conductivity is used around and between electrodes.<br>
The resistive arrangement, particularly the resistive film in a thin-film application, may<br>
comprise Nichrome (NiCr), Cr, Ta, tantalum oxynitride, or tantalum nitride or a material<br>
with similar properties, and e.g. a material comprising metal particles in a dielectric<br>
matrix, e.g. of a Cr and Si monoxide mixture or a Cr-SiO material. These materials may<br>
particularly be applicable for thin film technologies whereas preferably SrTiO3 and/or<br>
LaMnO3 or other materials with similar properties may be used otherwise.<br>
For a thick film implementation, the resistive arrangement may particularly have a<br>
thickness of about 5-10 μm and the electrodes may have a thickness of about 10 μm and<br>
be provided on a dielectric layer with a thickness approximately in the range 0.5-10 mm. It<br>
should be clear that the resistive arrangement may also be thicker than 10 μm, for example<br>
up to 50 μm or even more.<br>
6<br><br>
The arrangement may be a planar arrangement (with a resistive arrangement with a very<br>
high resistivity), both if it is a thick film arrangement or a thin-film arrangement.<br>
According to some embodiments, the resistive arrangement is arranged in order to<br>
substantially surround the high potential electrodes (or the electrodes requiring balancing).<br>
In other embodiments the resistive arrangement is provided between the high potential<br>
electrode or electrodes and the low or balancing potential electrode or electrodes or it may<br>
be disposed such as to both surround and be provided inbetween high and low/balancing<br>
potential electrodes respectively.<br>
In some implementations high potential as well as low or balancing potential electrodes<br>
may be located on two opposite sides of e.g. an electrically tunable dielectric material, i.e.<br>
two/multi-layer structures are also possible. Particularly the resistive arrangement is<br>
provided, on both opposite sides, between each high potential electrode and the adjacent<br>
respective low or balancing potential electrode or electrode arrangement respectively.<br>
In alternative embodiments the resistive arrangement comprises deliberate leakage<br>
currents enabled to flow in an electrically controllable or tunable dielectric layer or any<br>
other substrate in non-controllable arrangements or in any other substrate if controllable.<br>
Alternatively silicone or an isolation fluid is provided to more or less cover the resistive<br>
arrangement.<br>
The resistive arrangement at least to some extent, directly or indirectly, connects the low<br>
or balancing and high potential electrode(s). The resistive arrangement may also be in<br>
direct contact with the electrodes, or either low/balancing or high potential electrodes.<br>
In order to still further improve the arrangement, the high potential electrode or electrodes<br>
may additionally be encapsulated in silicone or immersed in an isolation fluid as in<br>
conventional technologies. The arrangement may have an extension, which particularly is<br>
planar and/or which is circular, oval, square-shaped, rectangular or ellipsoidal, trapezoid-<br>
or irregularly shaped etc., in other words have any appropriate shape depending on<br>
application. The high and/or low (balancing) potential electrodes may be printed or<br>
7<br><br>
sputtered/plated and etched in a dielectric layer, or some other appropriate substrate layer,<br>
acting solely as a substrate, or as an active layer in the sense that it provides for<br>
controllability. In particular implementations the at least two high potential electrodes are<br>
disposed at a distance from each other of approximately the order 0,1-10 mm, or e.g. a few<br>
μm:s, for example 3-30 μm or less, e.g. in thin film ferroelectric devices and integrated<br>
circuits, although also other distances of course can be used depending on which is the<br>
voltage that is applied or the voltage to which the electrodes are exposed.<br>
It should be clear that the inventive concept covers cases when the electrodes (high and/or<br>
low and/or balancing) are provided on a substrate, e.g. ferroelectric, and when they are<br>
not, or some is/are not, and that a high potential (peak-field) may be generated, e.g. due to<br>
a high potential electrode, at a low or balancing potential electrode, and that, through the<br>
invention such peak-fields will be suppressed. It should also be clear that the concept is<br>
applicable in e.g. a high potential electrode, with or without sharp edges which e.g. also<br>
may be spheroidically shaped or have a substantially circular cross-section or any other<br>
shape, where there is a high potential or which produces a high potential somewhere else,<br>
e.g. in the vicinity of a low or balancing potential electrode.<br>
The resistive arrangement, e.g. a film, may e.g. comprise SrTi03+LaMn03, cermets based<br>
on for example RuRuC, PbRu2O7 or BiRuO7 or polymeric resistor materials, BaPbCh,<br>
TaN, NiCr, CrSi, TaSi, TiW, Ruthenium or AgPt-based cermets.<br>
As fabrication methods may e.g. sputtering, plating, screen-printing be used. The<br>
substrate, e.g. a dielectricum, may be ferroelectric ceramic material, AI3O2, A1N, LTCC<br>
(Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics), organic circuit boards etc.<br>
The arrangement may particularly be used in ferroelectric based phase shifters, filters,<br>
matching circuits, controllable antennas, power splitters or similar.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1A shows a basic implementation of the inventive concept with an arrangement 10 in<br>
which a circular disk shaped high potential electrode 1A with a potential Vi is surrounded<br>
by, here, a ring shaped low potential electrode 2A which here has the potential Voi, which<br>
for example may be zero V or substantially ground. Between the high potential electrode<br>
1A and the low potential electrode 2A a resistive arrangement 3A is provided. The<br>
separation between the high potential electrode and the low potential electrode should at<br>
least be such as to prevent dielectric breakdown in the air (about 3-5 kV/mm) supposing<br>
that the field is "evened out" due to the resistive arrangement. If silicon encapsulation<br>
additionally is implemented, the distance may be reduced e.g. about 2-5 times, the other<br>
materials hence forming the limiting factor.<br>
In other embodiments, as will be described further below, low potential electrodes may be<br>
provided also on only one side of a high potential electrode, or on two or three sides etc.<br>
depending on application and implementation. In this basic embodiment there is no<br>
substrate layer or additional layer on which the electrodes are disposed shown since it is<br>
actually not necessary for the functioning of the inventive concept which merely is based<br>
on there being one or more high voltage or high potential electrodes e.g. with substantially<br>
sharp edges such that there is a risk of high electrostatic peak fields being generated at the<br>
edges or that field singularities are produced around the electrodes. When reference is<br>
made to field singularities occurring, it should be noted that the problems may be<br>
10<br><br>
produced in surrounding areas as well as any other adjacent material or substrate layer. For<br>
exemplifying reasons, the high voltages may relate to kV voltages over mm gaps but also<br>
higher voltages as well as lower voltages and in some implementations it may be as low as<br>
20 or a few Volts but then over urn wide gaps. However, in cases in which a field or a<br>
potential is applied voluntarily, for example in order to make an arrangement<br>
controllable, it is often attractive to be able to use as high field strengths as possible in<br>
order to achieve a good performance and a good controllability. Fig. IB is a top view of<br>
the arrangement in Fig. 1A.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment with an arrangement 20 according to the inventive concept in<br>
which a high voltage electrode or, more generally high voltage area IB, which may<br>
comprise one or more electrodes, is provided on a dielectric material 4B, here a dielectric<br>
material with a controllable dielectric constant, i.e. where the dielectric constant which can<br>
be tuned by means of an applied electrostatic field. According to the invention high<br>
resistivity arrangements or connections 3Bi, 3B2 are provided between different<br>
electrodes, here between the high voltage electrode IB and the low potential electrodes<br>
2Bj, 2B2 which may have the same or different potentials, the main thing being that it is<br>
low, for example substantially ground, or such as to balance the high potential electrode<br>
IB.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 2, a so called planar technology has been used in order to<br>
implement the idea of connecting different high voltage electrodes. The planar<br>
ferroelectric layer 4B for example comprises ceramic on which conducting regions (the<br>
electrodes) and resistive regions (the resistive arrangement) are printed or sputtered/plated<br>
and etched. The high voltage or high potential electrode IB has a high potential with<br>
reference to, here a ground plane 5B, on the opposite side or the backside of the<br>
ferroelectric layer 4B. In order to suppress the concentration of the electrical field around<br>
the edges of the high voltage electrodes or the electrodes of the high voltage area IB, two<br>
low potential electrodes 2Bi, 2B2, which may be grounded, are provided on two or more<br>
sides of the high potential electrode IB on top of the ferroelectric layer 4B. The high<br>
resistivity arrangement 3Bi, 3B2, which for example comprises a high resistivity film,<br>
connects the high potential electrode IB to the low potential electrodes or the ground<br>
electrodes 2Bi, 2B2. In this way it is provided for a steady transport of current which will<br>
11<br><br>
assure there will be a linear voltage drop from the high potential electrode IB to the low<br>
potential electrodes 2Bi, 2B2. In that manner a concentration of the field near the high<br>
potential electrode IB can be avoided which otherwise would have been the result. In one<br>
embodiment the resistive arrangement comprises a high resistivity film on the surface of<br>
the dielectric layer.<br>
In other embodiments the resistive arrangement may comprise deliberate leakage currents<br>
provided in the substrate or ferroelectric layer itself or optionally in resistive silicone or<br>
resistive fluid that may be provided around the electrodes.<br>
In one embodiment the thickness of the ferroelectric layer may be around 1 mm whereas<br>
the thickness of the electrodes may comprise about 10 μm. It should however be clear that<br>
these figures of course merely are given for exemplifying reasons. This embodiment<br>
shows an implementation based on planar technology but not implementing thin-film<br>
technology. It should be clear that the inventive concept is applicable also to other planar<br>
technologies, to thin-film technology based implementations etc, but also to non-planar<br>
technologies.<br>
However, in this particular embodiment a resistivity of the order 100 MOhm/square is<br>
suitable. This is also merely an exemplifying value and depending on application much<br>
lower resistivities for example down to less than, or a few MOhms/square and up to one or<br>
more GOhms/square may also be used. Generally the lower limit of the resistivity in a<br>
resistive arrangement that is used for an application can be set depending on requirements<br>
on maximum DC-power consumption and/or requirements as to maximum heating of the<br>
arrangement and/or requirements as to whether it should be applicable for microwave<br>
applications, i.e. if it has to allow microwaves to penetrate. The upper limit may for<br>
example be set depending on requirements as to fast reaction times, making it capable to<br>
handle fast changes at high voltages.<br>
Different materials can be used. As examples SrTiCh mixed with LaMn03 can be<br>
mentioned, for example 0.5 SrTi03, 0.5 LaMnCb as a screen printed with a thickness of<br>
about 10 μm and sintered at a high temperature, for example about 1200°C.<br>
12<br><br>
Also thin film technology can be used for the resistive films. One example of a suitable<br>
material could be Ni, Cr, for example Nichrome (80%Ni, 20%Cr).<br>
In addition to Ni-Cr thin film resistor materials, Cr, Ta, tantalum oxynitride, tantalum<br>
nitride, and other materials could be used for the manufacture of thin-film resistive<br>
arrangements.<br>
Other possible alternative materials that could be used in thin-film resistors are solid<br>
solutions of metal particles in a dielectric matrix, e.g. Cr and Si Monoxide mixtures.<br>
Fig. 3 shows simulated equi-potential lines for a state of the art arrangement 10o featuring<br>
only backside ground. It can be seen that the potential lines are concentrated close to the<br>
electrode edges which corresponds to a field concentration. In this plot there is a 10%<br>
difference in the potential between consecutive equi-potential lines.<br>
Fig. 4 is a figure similar to that of Fig. 3 but for an arrangement 10' according to the<br>
inventive concept in which low potential electrodes or ground electrodes are provided on<br>
either sides of a high potential electrode and between which and the high potential<br>
electrode a resistive arrangement is disposed as discussed above. (For reasons of clarity<br>
this is however not shown in this figure, but any one of the arrangements described herein<br>
might constitute arrangement 10'.) The distance between the potential lines will here be<br>
constant along the surface of the substrate. It is an extremely important advantage of the<br>
present invention that the singularities or peak-fields will be suppressed also inside the<br>
substrate (if such is provided). This is very critical for a long-term, high voltage reliability<br>
of the substrate.<br>
It is extremely advantageous that through the implementation of the inventive concept the<br>
peak-fields around e.g. sharp edge electrodes, particularly planar electrodes, will be<br>
suppressed as well as, if such is provided, the peak-fields will be suppressed also inside<br>
and above a substrate which most particularly may be electrically controllable. This will<br>
have a substantial impact on the performance and reliability of such arrangements.<br>
13<br><br>
In different embodiments one or more of already known technologies may also be<br>
combined with the inventive concept in order to, for example, increase the dielectric<br>
strength above a substrate.<br>
It should be clear that the inventive concept can be varied in many different manners, the<br>
main thing being the provisioning of a resistive connection to low (in terms of the absolute<br>
value) or with respect to, also high balancing, e.g. of opposite sign, potential electrodes<br>
that are used to provide a steady current from the high potential (in terms of an absolute<br>
value) electrode edges, and which forces the voltage to drop linearly.<br>
In the following some examples will be briefly discussed with reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 5A schematically illustrates a general case in which two three dimensional high<br>
potential electrodes Ci, C2 are provided having first high potentials V41, V42 respectively<br>
which may be different or the same. The resistive arrangement 2C is provided inside a<br>
three-dimensional box surrounding the three-dimensional or high potential electrodes.<br>
Here it is supposed that ground is the low potential.<br>
Fig. 5B is a schematical perspective view of the arrangement of Fig. 5 A.<br>
Fig. 6 shows another example of an implementation in which two high potential electrodes<br>
ID], ID2 are provided on an arbitrary dielectric layer 4D. According to the inventive<br>
concept low potential electrodes 2D\, 2D2 are provided on respective external sides of the<br>
high potential electrodes and a resistive arrangement 3D], 3D2, 3D3 is provided between<br>
all electrodes. It is here supposed that the high potential electrodes lDi, ID2 have different<br>
potentials V51, V52 whereas the low potential electrodes are substantially grounded or have<br>
the same potential V05. However, the high voltage electrodes can have different or even<br>
very different potentials (in absolute values) or differ only slightly and also the low<br>
potential electrodes may have different potentials. Alternatively the added electrodes may<br>
comprise balancing electrodes, e.g. of the opposite sign with respect to the high potential<br>
electrodes.<br>
14<br><br>
Fig. 7 schematically illustrates one example of a circular arrangement with two high<br>
potential electrodes lEi, IE2 which here have same potential V6i and are disposed<br>
between the low potential electrodes 2Ei, 2E2, 2E3, here with the same potential V06 which<br>
may be close to ground. The electrodes are also surrounded by a high resistivity<br>
arrangement 3E. It should be clear that also here there might be more high potential<br>
electrodes, only one high potential electrode, high potential electrodes with different<br>
potentials etc., and the low potential electrodes might comprise balancing electrodes.<br>
Fig. 8 very schematically illustrates still an another implementation with two high<br>
potential electrodes IF), IF2 with different potentials V71, V72 surrounded by a high<br>
resistivity arrangement 3F. In this case a low potential electrode arrangement 2F is<br>
provided which partly surrounds the electrodes in that it surrounds two outer sides of the<br>
second high potential electrode IF2 and one outer side of the high potential electrode lFi<br>
and assumes the form of the outer edges of a half rectangle. It should be clear that also in<br>
this case there might be but one high potential electrode, more high potential electrodes,<br>
they might have different potentials or the same potentials etc.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrate an ellipsoidal implementation with two high potential electrodes lGi, IG2<br>
with different potentials Vgi, Vg2 surrounded by a high resistivity arrangement 3G. In one<br>
embodiment the two high potential electrodes (presupposing more or less symmetrical<br>
conditions) one of which, here named the balancing electrode, such that the average of the<br>
potential will be close to ground. It is supposed that the resistive arrangement 3G is large<br>
compared to the electrodes. Then the outer edge of the resistive arrangement will<br>
experience a potential close to zero automatically, without surrounding electrode. Hence,<br>
one of the "high" potential electrodes is the balancing electrode for the other and vice<br>
versa. Of course it may also be surrounded by a low potential electrode (not shown).<br>
Fig. 10 very schematically illustrates still another implementation in which a high<br>
potential electrode 1H is surrounded on four sides by low potential (or balancing)<br>
electrodes 2H]? 2H2, 2H3, 2H4, all at a potential V09. The high potential electrode is here<br>
supposed to have a potential V9. Resistive arrangement 3H here surrounds all the<br>
electrodes. It might alternatively be provided only between the low potential electrodes<br>
2Hi,...,2H4 and the high potential electrode 1H.<br>
15<br><br>
Finally Fig. 11A is a top view of an embodiment wherein a high potential electrode lKi at<br>
a voltage Vioi is provided on top of a ferroelectric material, i.e. a tunable dielectric<br>
material 4K (cf. Fig. 11B) on the opposite side of which another high potential electrode<br>
1K2 (at V102) is provided (cf. Fig. 1 IB). The high potential electrodes lKi, IK2 are<br>
surrounded by low resistivity arrangements 3Ki, 3K.2 and externally surrounded by low<br>
potential electrodes respectively. On the side where the first high potential electrode lKi is<br>
provided, resistive arrangement 3Ki is provided whereas at the opposite side, where the<br>
second high potential electrode IK2 is disposed, a resistive arrangement 3K2 is provided.<br>
In this particular embodiment it is supposed that the ferroelectric layer 4K, or generally a<br>
substrate layer, is possible to penetrate with microwaves. In such an embodiment the high<br>
voltage electrode lKi and the backside electrode IK2 should have a limited conductivity<br>
and thickness so that the microwaves are allowed to pass. This may be very useful in<br>
arrangements based on tuning of ferroelectrics. Hence it is supposed that the electrode<br>
material used for the high potential electrodes is a low microwave absorption electrode<br>
material. It is similar to the resistive film, but the resistivity is an order of magnitude<br>
lower. Of course any such material can be used.<br>
It should be clear that the inventive concept is not limited to the explicitly illustrated<br>
embodiments but that it can be varied in a number of ways. For example it is possible to<br>
have strongly differing high potential electrodes close to one another, for example a very<br>
high potential electrode at for example 10000 V next to an electrode at a potential of -<br>
10000 V. In such an embodiment they could both be surrounded by low potential<br>
electrodes, or electrodes with a potential close to zero. Hence, a high potential electrode<br>
may here also mean an electrode provided at a very low (negative) potential and the<br>
concept is applicable to electrodes with very different potentials in which case a low<br>
potential electrode may be provided e.g. such as to surround partly or completely the<br>
electrode arrangement comprising one or more such electrodes or alternatively, or<br>
additionally, between all the respective electrodes and several variations are in principle<br>
possible, surrounding, partly surrounding, surrounding one side of a respective electrode.<br>
Hence, it should be clear that a resistive arrangement and the low potential electrodes can<br>
be disposed in many different ways with respect to high potential electrodes with the<br>
above mentioned meaning of high potential electrode or when there is a very big potential<br>
16<br><br>
difference between two electrodes or components, low potential electrode(s) and a<br>
resistive arrangement may be arranged such as to surround or be provided inbetween or<br>
merely inbetween etc. However, if there is one high potential electrode (e.g. at<br>
approximately 8000 V or at approximately -8000 V), there may be provided a balance<br>
potential electrode at e.g. about -8000 V or +8000 V respectively, if symmetric, which<br>
means that the low potential electrode is replaced by a balance potential electrode, i.e.<br>
there is no need for a "low" potential electrode. It should also be clear that many different<br>
materials can be used in the resistive arrangement, the electrodes, a controllable layer or a<br>
substrate layer in general, only a few have been mentioned since it should be obvious to<br>
the man skilled in the art with knowledge of this document which other materials that<br>
could be used. Still further it should be clear that an arrangement according to the<br>
inventive concept can be implemented in many different components where field<br>
singularities or peak-fields may cause problems.<br>
