Information signal processing by modification in the<br>
spectral/modulation spectral range representation <br>
Description<br>
The present invention generally relates to the processing<br>
of information signals, such as audio signals, vide<br>
signals or other multimedia signals, and particularly to<br>
the processing of information signals in the<br>
spectral/modulation spectral range.<br>
In the field of signal processing, such as the processing<br>
of digital audio signals, there are frequently signals<br>
consisting of a carrier signal component and a modulation<br>
component. In the case of modulated signals, a<br>
representation in which the signals are decomposed into<br>
carrier and modulation components is often required, for<br>
example to be able to filter, code or otherwise modify<br>
them.<br>
For the purposes of audio coding, it is known, for example,<br>
to subject the audio signal to a so-called modulation<br>
transform. Here, the audio signal is decomposed into<br>
frequency bands by a transform. Subsequently, a<br>
decomposition into magnitude and phase is performed. While<br>
the phase is not processed any further, the magnitudes per<br>
subband are re-transformed via a number of transform blocks<br>
in a second transform. The result is a frequency<br>
decomposition of the time envelope of the respective<br>
subband into modulation coefficients. Audio codings<br>
consisting of such a modulation transform are, for example,<br>
described in M. Vinton and L. Atlas, "A Scalable and<br>
Progressive Audio Codec", in Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE<br>
ICASSP, 7-11 May 2001, Salt Lake City, United States<br>
Patent Application US 2002/0176353A1: Atlas et al.,<br>
"Scalable And Perceptually Ranked Signal Coding And<br>
Decoding", 11/28/2002, and J. Thompson and L. Atlas, "A<br><br>
Non-uniform Modulation Transform for Audio Coding with<br>
Increased Time Resolution", in Proceedings of the 2003 IEEE<br>
ICASSP, 6-10 April, Hong Kong, 2003.<br>
An overview of further various demodulation techniques<br>
across the full bandwidth of the signal to be demodulated<br>
including asynchronous and synchronous demodulation<br>
techniques, etc. is given, for example, by the article L.<br>
Atlas, "Joint Acoustic And Modulation Frequency", Journal<br>
on Applied Signal Processing 7 EURASIP, pp. 668-675, 2003.<br>
A disadvantage of the above schemes for audio coding using<br>
a modulation transform is the following. As long as no<br>
further processing steps are performed on the modulation<br>
coefficients together with the phases, the modulation<br>
coefficients form a spectral/modulation spectral<br>
representation of the audio signal that is reversible and<br>
perfectly reconstructing, i.e. it is re-convertible without<br>
changes back into the original audio signal in the time<br>
domain. However, in these methods the modulation<br>
coefficients are filtered to reduce and/or quantize the<br>
modulation coefficients to values as small as possible<br>
according to psychoacoustic criteria, so that a maximum<br>
compression rate is achieved. However, this generally does<br>
not accomplish the desired goal to remove the respective<br>
modulation components from the resulting signal or to<br>
deliberately introduce quantization noise in this<br>
component. This is due to the fact that, after the back-<br>
transform of the changed modulation coefficients, the<br>
phases of the subbands are no longer consistent with the<br>
changed magnitudes of these subbands and continue to<br>
contain strong components of the modulation component of<br>
the original signal. If the phases of the subbands are now<br>
recombined with the changed magnitudes, these modulation<br>
components are reintroduced into the filtered or quantized<br>
signal by the phase. In other words, a modulation transform<br>
followed by a modification of the modulation coefficients<br>
in the above manner, i.e. by filtering the modulation<br><br>
coefficients, together with a subsequent synthesis of the<br>
phase and magnitude components provides a signal that, in<br>
another analysis and/or modulation transform, still<br>
contains significant modulation components at those places<br>
in the spectral/modulation spectral range representation<br>
that should have been filtered out. Effective filtering lis<br>
thus not possible based on the above-mentioned modulation<br><br>
transform-based signal processing schemes.	<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an information signal<br>
processing scheme allowing to process modulated signals<br>
with a carrier component and a modulation component<br>
separated according to modulation and carrier component in<br>
a more controlled way.<br>
It is thus the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
processing scheme for information signals allowing<br>
processing of information signals that is separated<br>
according to modulation and carrier components in a mpre<br>
controlled way.<br>
This object is achieved by a device according to claim 1<br>
and a method according to claim 17.<br>
An inventive device for processing an information signal<br>
includes means for converting the information signal into a<br>
time/spectral representation by block-wise transforming the<br>
information signal and means for converting the information<br>
signal from the time/spectral representation to a<br>
spectral/modulation spectral representation, wherein the<br>
means for converting is designed such that the<br>
spectral/modulation spectral representation depends on both<br>
a magnitude component and a phase component of the<br>
time/spectral representation of the information signal. A<br>
means then performs a manipulation and/or modification of<br>
the information signal in the spectral/modulation spectral<br>
representation to obtain a modified spectral/modulation<br>
spectral representation. A further means finally forms a<br><br>
processed information signal representing a processed<br>
version of the information signal based on the modified<br>
spectral/modulation spectral representation.<br>
The core idea of the present invention is that processing<br>
of information signals that is separated more rigorously<br>
according to modulation and carrier components may be<br>
achieved if the conversion of the information signal from<br>
the time/spectral representation and/or the time/frequency<br>
representation into the spectral/modulation spectral<br>
representation and/or the frequency /modulation frequency<br>
representation is performed depending on both a magnitude<br>
component and a phase component of the time/spectral<br>
representation of the information signal. This eliminates a<br>
recombination between phase and magnitude and thus the<br>
reintroduction of undesired modulation components into the<br>
time representation of the processed information signal on<br>
the synthesis side.<br>
The conversion of the information signal from the<br>
time/spectral representation to the spectral/modulatlion<br>
spectral representation considering both the magnitude and<br>
the phase involves the problem that the time/spectfral<br>
representation of the information signal actually depends<br>
not only on the information signal, but also on the pnase<br>
offset of the time blocks with respect to the carlier<br>
spectral component of the information signal. In other<br>
words, the block-wise transform of the information signal<br>
from the time representation to the time/spectral<br>
representation causes the sequences of spectral values<br>
obtained in the time/spectral representation of the<br>
information signal per spectral component to comprise an<br>
up-modulated complex carrier depending only on the<br>
asynchronism of the block repeating frequency with respect<br>
to the carrier frequency component of the information<br>
signal. According to the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a demodulation of the sequence of spectral<br>
values in the time/spectral representation of the<br><br>
information signal is thus performed per spectral component<br>
to obtain a demodulated sequence of spectral values per<br>
spectral component. The subsequent conversion of the thus<br>
obtained demodulated sequences of spectral values is<br>
performed by block-wise transform of the time/spectral<br>
representation into the spectral/modulation spectral<br>
representation and/or by their block-wise spectral<br>
decomposition, thereby obtaining blocks of modulation<br>
values. These are manipulated and/or modified, for example<br>
weighted with a corresponding weighting function for<br>
bandpass filtering for the removal of the modulation<br>
component from the original information signal. The result<br>
is a modified demodulated sequence of spectral values<br>
and/or a modified demodulated time/spectral representation.<br>
The complex carrier is again modulated upon the thus<br>
obtained modified demodulated sequences of spectral values,<br>
thus obtaining a modified sequence of spectral values<br>
representing a part of a time/spectral representation of<br>
the processed information signal. A back-conversion of this<br>
representation into the time representation yields a<br>
processed information signal in the time representation<br>
and/or time domain, which may be changed in a highly<br>
accurate way with respect to the original information<br>
signal regarding modulation and carrier components.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
explained below in more detail referring to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block circuit diagram of a device for<br>
processing an information signal according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic for illustrating the operation<br>
of the device of Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a device for processing an information signal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br><br>
device of Fig. 1, generally indicated at 10, includes an<br>
input 12, at which it receives the information signal 14 to<br>
be processed. The device of Fig. 1 is exemplarily provided<br>
to process the information signal 14 such that the<br>
modulation component is removed from the information signal<br>
14, and to thus obtain a processed information signal with<br>
only the carrier component. Furthermore, the device 10<br>
includes an output 16 to output the carrier component as<br>
the processing result and/or the processed information<br>
signal 18.<br>
Internally, the device 10 is essentially divided into a<br>
portion 20 for converting the information signal 14 from a<br>
time representation to a time/frequency representation,<br>
means 22 for converting the information signal from the<br>
time/frequency representation to the frequency/modulation<br>
frequency representation, a portion 24 in which the actual<br>
processing is performed, i.e. the modification of the<br>
information signal, and a portion 26 for the back-<br>
conversion of the information signal processed in the<br>
frequency /modulation frequency representation from tihis<br>
representation to the time representation. The mentioned<br>
four portions are connected in series between the input 12<br>
and the output 16 in this order, wherein their more<br>
detailed structure and their more detailed operation will<br>
be described below.<br>
Portion 20 of the device 10 includes a windowing means 28<br>
and a transform means 30 that follow at the input 12 in<br>
this order. In particular, an input of the windowing means<br>
28 is connected to input 12 to receive the information<br>
signal 14 as a sequence of information values. If the<br>
information signal is still present as an analog signal, it<br>
may, for example, be converted to a sequence of information<br>
and/or sample values by an A/D converter and/or discrete<br>
sampling. The windowing means 28 forms blocks of the same<br>
number of information values each from the sequence of<br>
information values and additionally performs a weighting<br><br>
with a weighting function on each block of information<br>
values which, however, cannot, for example, exclusively<br>
correspond to a sine window or a KBD window. The blocks may-<br>
overlap, such as by 50%, or not. Merely as an example, a<br>
50% overlap is assumed in the following. The preferred<br>
window functions have the property that they allow good<br>
subband separation in the time/spectral representation aind<br>
that the squares of their weighting values, which<br>
correspond to each other as they are applied to one and the<br>
same information value, add to one in the overlap area.<br>
An output of the windowing means 28 is connected to an<br>
input of the transform means 30. The blocks of information<br>
values output by the windowing means 28 are received by the<br>
transform means 30. The transform means 30 then subjects<br>
them block-wise to a spectrally decomposing transform, such<br>
as a DFT or another complex transform. The transform means<br>
30 thus block-wise achieves a decomposition of the<br>
information signal 14 into spectral components and thus<br>
particularly generates a block of spectral values including<br>
one spectral value per spectral component per time block,<br>
as it is received from the windowing means 28. Several<br>
spectral values may be combined to subbands. In the<br>
following, however, the terms subband and spectral<br>
component are used as synonyms. For each spectral component<br>
and/or each subband, the result is thus one spectral value<br>
or several ones, if there is a subband combination, which,<br>
however, is not assumed in the following, per time block.<br>
Accordingly, the transform means 30 outputs a sequence of<br>
spectral values per spectral component and/or subband that<br>
represent the course in time of this spectral component<br>
and/or this subband. The spectral values output by the<br>
transform means 30 represent a time/frequency<br>
representation of the information signal 14.<br>
Portion 22 includes a carrier frequency determination means<br>
32, a mixer 34 serving as demodulation means, a windowing<br>
means 36 and a second transform means 38.<br><br>
The windowing means 32 includes an input connected to the<br>
output of the transform means 30. There it receives the<br>
spectral value sequences for the individual subbands and<br>
divides the spectral value sequences per subband<br>
similarly to the windowing means 28 with respect to the<br>
information signal 14 - into blocks and weights the<br>
spectral values of each block with an appropriate weighting<br>
function. The weighting function may be one of the<br>
weighting functions already exemplarily mentioned above<br>
with respect to means 28. The consecutive blocks in a<br>
subband may or may not overlap, wherein the following again<br>
exemplarily assumes a mutual overlap of 50%. The following<br>
assumes that the blocks of different subbands are aligned<br>
with respect to each other, as it will be explained in more<br>
detail below with respect to Fig. 1. However, another<br>
procedure with block sequences offset between the subbands<br>
would also be conceivable. At the output, the windowing<br>
means outputs sequences of windowed spectral value blocks<br>
per subband.<br>
The carrier frequency determination means 32 also includes<br>
an input connected to the output of the transform means 30<br>
to obtain the spectral values of the subbands and/or<br>
spectral components as sequences of spectral values per<br>
subband. It is provided to find out, in each subband, the<br>
carrier component caused by the individual time blocks,<br>
from which the individual spectral values of the subbands<br>
have been derived, comprising a phase offset varying in<br>
time with respect to the carrier frequency component of the<br>
information signal 14. The carrier frequency determination<br>
means 32 outputs the carrier component determined per<br>
subband at its output to an input of the mixer 34 which, in<br>
turn, has another input connected to the output of the<br>
windowing means 36.<br>
The mixer 34 is designed such that it multiplies, per<br>
subband, the blocks of windowed spectral values, as they<br><br>
are output by the transform means, by the complex conjugate<br>
of the respective carrier component, as it has been<br>
determined by the carrier frequency determination means 30<br>
for the respective subband, thus demodulating the subbands<br>
and/or blocks of windowed spectral values.<br>
At the output of the mixer 34, the result are thus<br>
demodulated subbands and/or the result is a sequence of<br>
demodulated blocks of windowed spectral values per subband.<br>
The output of the mixer 34 is connected to an input of the<br>
transform means 38, so that the latter receives blocks of<br>
windowed and demodulated spectral values overlapping each<br>
other - here by exemplary 50% - per subband and transforms<br>
and/or spectrally decomposes them block-wise into the<br>
spectral/modulation spectral representation to generate a<br>
frequency/modulation frequency representation of the<br>
information signal 14 up to now only modified with respect<br>
to the demodulation of the subband spectral value sequences<br>
by processing all subbands and/or spectral components. The<br>
transform on which the transform means 38 is based per<br>
subband may be, for example, a DFT, an MDCT, MOST or the<br>
like, and particularly also the same transform as that of<br>
transform means 30. Fig. 1 exemplarily assumes that the<br>
transforms of both transform means 30, 38 is a DFT.<br>
Accordingly, the transform means 38 successively outputs<br>
blocks of values, referred to as modulation values in the<br>
following and representing a spectral decomposition of the<br>
blocks of windowed and demodulated spectral values, at its<br>
output for each subband and/or each spectral component. The<br>
blocks of spectral values per subband, with respect to<br>
which the transform means 38 performs the transforms, are<br>
time-aligned with each other, so that the result per time<br>
period is always immediately a matrix of modulation values<br>
composed of a modulation value block per subband. The<br>
transform means 38 passes the modulation values on to the<br>
portion 24, which only comprises a signal processing means<br>
40.<br><br>
The signal processing means 40 is connected to the output<br>
of the transform means 38 and thus receives the blocks of<br>
modulation values, in the present exemplary case, because<br>
the device 10 serves for modulation component suppression,<br>
the signal processing means 40 performs an effective low-<br>
pass filtering in the frequency domain on the incoming<br>
blocks of modulation values, i.e. a weighting of the<br>
modulation values with a function dropping to higher and/or<br>
lower modulation frequencies starting from the modulation<br>
frequency zero. The thus modified blocks of modulation<br>
values are passed to the back-conversion portion 26 by the<br>
signal processing means 40. The modified blocks of<br>
modulation values output by the signal processing means 40<br>
represent a modified frequency/modulation frequency<br>
representation of the information signal 14, or in other<br>
words a frequency/modulation frequency representation still<br>
differing from the frequency/modulation frequency<br>
representation of the modified information signal 18 by the<br>
demodulation by the mixer 34.<br>
The back-conversion portion 26, in turn, is divided into<br>
two portions, i.e. a portion for the conversion of the<br>
processed information signal 18 from the<br>
frequency/modulation frequency representation, as output by<br>
the signal processing means 40, to the time/f requency<br>
representation, and a portion for the back-conversion of<br>
the processed information signal from the time/frequency<br>
representation to the time representation. The former of<br>
the two portions includes transform means 42 for performing<br>
a block-wise transform inverse to the transform according<br>
to the transform means 38, a mixer 4 6 and a combination<br>
means 44. The latter portion of the back-conversion portion<br>
26 includes transform means 48 for performing a block-wise<br>
transform inverse to the transform of the transform means<br>
30 and a combination means 50.<br><br>
With its input, the inverse transform means 42 is connected<br>
to the output of the signal processing means 40 and<br>
transforms the modified blocks of modulation values<br>
subband-wise from the spectral representation back to the<br>
time/frequency representation and thus reverses the<br>
spectral decomposition to obtain a sequence of modified<br>
blocks of spectral values per subband. These modified<br>
spectral value blocks output by the inverse transform means<br>
42 differ from the spectral value blocks as output by the<br>
windowing means 36, but not only by the processing by the<br>
signal processing means 40, but also by the demodulation<br>
effected by the mixer 34. Therefore, the mixer 46 receives<br>
the sequences of modified spectral value blocks output by<br>
the inverse transform means 42 per subband and mixes them<br>
with a complex carrier, which is complex conjugate with<br>
respect to that used at the corresponding place and/or for<br>
the corresponding block for the demodulation of the<br>
information signal at the mixer 34, to modulate the<br>
spectral value blocks again with the carrier caused by the<br>
phase offsets of the time blocks. The result yielded at the<br>
output of the mixer 4 6 is a sequence of modified, non-<br>
demodulated spectral value blocks per subband.<br>
The output of the mixer 4 6 is connected to an input of the<br>
combination means 44. It combines, per subband, the<br>
sequence of modified blocks of spectral values again up-<br>
modulated with the complex carrier to form a uniform stream<br>
and/or a uniform sequence of spectral values by<br>
appropriately linking mutually corresponding spectral<br>
values of adjacent and/or consecutive blocks of spectral<br>
values for a subband, as they are received from the mixer<br>
46. In the case of the use of weighting functions<br>
exemplarily mentioned above with the positive property that<br>
the squares of mutually corresponding weighting values are<br>
summed to one in the case of overlapping, the combination<br>
consists in a simple addition of spectral values associated<br>
with each other. The result output at the output of the<br>
combination means 44 (OLA = overlap add) is composed of a<br><br>
modified sequence of spectral values per subband. The<br>
result thus output at the output of the OLA 4 4 are thus<br>
modified subbands and/or modified sequences of spectral<br>
values for all spectral components and represents a<br>
modified time/frequency representation of the information<br>
signal 14 and/or a time/frequency representation of bhe<br>
modified information signal 18.<br>
The transform means 48 receives the spectral value<br>
sequences and thus particularly one after the other always<br>
one spectral value for all subbands and/or spectral<br>
components and/or one after the other one spectral<br>
decomposition of a portion of the modified information<br>
signal 18. By reversing the spectral decomposition, it<br>
generates a sequence of modified time blocks from the<br>
sequence of spectral decompositions. These modified time<br>
blocks are, in turn, received by the combination means 50.<br>
The combination means 50 operates similarly to the<br>
combination means 44. It combines the modified time blocks<br>
exemplarily overlapping by 50% by adding mutually<br>
corresponding information values from adjacent anal/or<br>
consecutive modified time blocks. The result at the output<br>
of the combination means 50 is thus a sequence of<br>
information values representing the processed information<br>
signal 18.<br>
The structure of the device 10 and the operation of the<br>
individual components having been described above, the<br>
following will discuss their operation in more detail with<br>
respect to Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The processing of the information signal by the device 10<br>
starts with the reception of the audio signal 14 at the<br>
input 12. The information signal 14 is present in a sampled<br>
form. The sampling has been done, for example, by means of<br>
an analog/digital converter. The sampling has been done<br>
with a certain sampling frequency ωs. The information<br>
signal 14 consequently reaches the input 12 as a sequence<br><br>
of sample and/or information values Si = s (27π/ωs.i) , wherein<br>
s is the analog information signal, Si are the information<br>
values, and the index i is an index for the information<br>
values. Among the incoming samples Si, the windowing meams<br>
28 always combines 2N consecutive samples to form time<br>
blocks, in the present example with a 50% overlap. For<br>
example, it combines the samples s0 to S2N-1 to form a time<br>
block with the index n = 0, the samples sN to S3N-1 to form<br>
a second time block with the index n = 1, the samples S2N<br>
to s4N-1 to form a third time block of information values<br>
with the index n = 2, etc. The windowing means 28 weights<br>
each of these blocks with a window and/or weighting<br>
function, as described above. Let sn0 to sn2N-1 be, for<br>
example, the 2N information values of the time block n,<br>
then the block output by the means 28 is finally yielded as<br>
sn0 —&gt; sn0-go to sn2N-1 -&gt; sn2N-1g2N-1, wherein gi with i = 0 to<br>
2N-1 is the weighting function.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the windowing functions applied to the<br>
information values si exemplarily for four consecutive time<br>
blocks n = 0, 1, 2, 3 in a diagram 70, in which the time t<br>
is plotted along the x-axis in arbitrary units, and the<br>
amplitude of the windowing functions is plotted along the<br>
y-axis in arbitrary units. In this way, the windowing means<br>
28 passes a new windowed time block of 2N information<br>
values each to the transform means 30 after always N<br>
information values. The repetition frequency of the time<br>
blocks is thus ωS/N.<br>
The transform means 30 transforms the windowed time blocks<br>
to a spectral representation. The transform means 30<br>
performs a spectral decomposition of the time blocks of<br>
windowed information values into a plurality of<br>
predetermined subbands and/or spectral components. The<br>
present case exemplarily assumes that the transform is a<br>
DFT and/or discrete Fourier transform. For each time block<br>
of 2N information values, the transform means 30 generates<br>
N complex-valued spectral values for N spectral components,<br><br>
if the information signal is real, in this exemplary case.<br>
The complex spectral values output by the transform means<br>
30 represent the time/frequency representation 74 of the<br>
information signal. The complex spectral values are<br>
illustrated by boxes 76 in Fig. 2. As the transform means<br>
30 generates at least one spectral value per consecutive<br>
time block of information values per subband and/or<br>
spectral component, the transform means 30 thus outputs a<br>
sequence of spectral values 7 6 per subband and/or spectral<br>
component at the frequency ωs/N. The spectral values output<br>
for a time block are illustrated horizontally located along<br>
the frequency axis 78 at 74 in Fig. 2. The spectral values<br>
output for a subsequent time block follow directly below in<br>
a vertical direction along the axis 80. The axes 78 and 80<br>
thus represent the frequency and/or time axis of the<br>
time/frequency representation of the information signal 14.<br>
Exemplarily, Fig. 3 only shows four subbands. The sequence<br>
of spectral values per subband run along the columns in the<br>
exemplary representation of Fig. 2 and are illustrated by<br>
82a, 82b, 82c and 82d.<br>
Reference is briefly made to Fig. 1 again, where the<br>
information signal 14 is exemplarily illustrated as a<br>
function representable by sin (bt) • (1+µ.sin (at) ) , wherein α<br>
is, for example, the modulation frequency of the envelope<br>
of the information signal 14 indicated by the dashed line<br>
84, while β represents the carrier frequency of the<br>
information signal 14, t is the time, and µ is the<br>
modulation depth. With a sufficiently high sampling<br>
frequency ωs, the result for this exemplary information<br>
signal by the transform 72 per time block is a block of<br>
spectral values 7 6, i.e. a row at 74, in which mainly the<br>
spectral component and/or the pertinent spectral value has<br>
a distinct maximum at the carrier frequency β. However, the<br>
spectral values for this spectral component f = β vary in<br>
time for consecutive time blocks due to the variation of<br>
the envelope 84. Accordingly, the magnitude of the spectral<br><br>
values of the spectral component β varies with the<br>
modulation frequency α.<br>
Up to here, the discussion has not taken into account that<br>
the various time blocks may each have a different phase<br>
offset with respect to the carrier frequency β due to a<br>
frequency mismatch between the time block repeating<br>
frequency ωs/N and the carrier frequency of the information<br>
signal 14. Depending on the phase offset, the spectral<br>
values of the spectral blocks resulting from the time<br>
blocks in transform 72 are modulated with a carrier ,<br>
wherein j represent the imaginary unit, f represents the<br>
frequency, and ∆φ represents the phase offset of the<br>
respective time block. For an essentially equal carrier<br>
frequency, as is the case in the present exemplary case,<br>
the phase offset ∆φ increases linearly. Therefore, the<br>
spectral values of a subband experience, due to a frequency<br>
mismatch between the time block repeating frequency and the<br>
carrier frequency, a modulation with a carrier component<br>
depending on the mismatch of the two frequencies.<br>
Taking this into account, the carrier frequency<br>
determination means 32 now derives the carrier component in<br>
the subbands resulting by the phase offset of the time<br>
blocks and/or effected by the time block phase offset from<br>
the spectral values a(ωb,n), wherein ωb is the angular<br>
frequency ω and/or frequency f (ω=2πf) of the respective<br>
subband 0≤b<n among all n subbands and is the time block></n>
and/or spectral block index associated with the time t<br>
according to n = ωs.t. The thus determined modulation<br>
carrier frequency ω (m, f) is determined by the carrier<br>
frequency determination means 32 for each subband ωb and/or<br>
each frequency f block-wise, wherein m indicates a block<br>
index, as will be explained in more detail below. For this<br>
purpose, the carrier frequency determination means 32<br>
always combines M consecutive spectral values 7 6 of a<br>
subband ωb, such as the spectral values a(ωb,0) to a(ωb,M-<br>
1) . Among these M spectral values, it determines a phase<br><br>
behavior and/or course by phase unwrapping. Subsequently,<br>
it determines a linear equation that comes closest to the<br>
phase behavior, for example by means of a least error<br>
squares algorithm. From the slope and an axis portion<br>
and/or a phase or initial offset of the linear equation,<br>
the carrier frequency determination means 32 obtains the<br>
desired modulation carrier frequency ωd for the subband b<br>
with respect to the time block m and/or a spectral value<br>
block phase offset (p for the subband b with respect to the<br>
time block m. This determination is performed by the<br>
carrier frequency determination means for all subbands via<br>
spectral values equal in time, i.e. for all spectral value<br>
blocks a(ωb,0) to a(ωb,M-1) with ωb for all subbands 0≤b<n.></n.>
In this way, the carrier frequency determination means 32<br>
determines a modulation carrier frequency ωd and the<br>
spectral value block phase offset φ for each subband ωb,<br>
block after block. The division into blocks, on which the<br>
determination of the complex carriers for all subbands by<br>
the means 32 is based, is that also used by the windowing<br>
means for windowing. The carrier frequency determination<br>
means 32 outputs the determined values for the complex<br>
carriers to the demodulation means and/or the mixer 34.<br>
The mixer 34 now mixes the windowed blocks of spectral<br>
values of the individual subbands, as they are output by<br>
the windowing means 36, with the complex conjugate of the<br>
respective modulation carrier frequencies ωd considering<br>
the spectral value block phase offsets φ by multiplication<br>
of these subband spectral value blocks by <br>
wherein, as mentioned above, a different pair of ωd ard φ<br>
is always used for each subband and within each subband for<br>
the consecutive blocks. In this way, the mixer 34 outputs<br>
demodulated subband spectral value blocks aligned to each<br>
other, i.e. two-dimensional blocks of N spectral value<br>
blocks of M demodulated spectral values each.<br>
As the modulations in the subbands caused by the time block<br>
offsets have been removed by the demodulation by means of<br><br>
the mixer 34, the phase behavior of the spectral values in<br>
the subbands within the blocks is flatter on the average<br>
and essentially runs around the phase 0. What is achieved<br>
in this way is that, in the subsequent transform by the<br>
transform means 38, the demodulated and windowed blocks of<br>
spectral values result in a spectral decomposition in which<br>
the frequency 0 and/or the constant component is very well<br>
centered.<br>
The transform 86 by the transform means 38 following the<br>
demodulation 84 by the mixer 34 is performed block-wise on<br>
each subband and/or each sequence of demodulated blocks of<br>
spectral values. The transform 86 particularly subjects the<br>
demodulated spectral value blocks of the N subbands blosk-<br>
wise to a spectral decomposition. The result of the<br>
spectral decomposition of the blocks of spectral values may<br>
also be referred to as modulation frequency representation.<br>
For N blocks of windowed and demodulated spectral values<br>
aligned to each other, the transform 86 thus results in a<br>
matrix of M x N modulation values representing the<br>
frequency/modulation frequency representation of the<br>
information signal 14 over the time period of the M time<br>
blocks that contributed to this matrix. The modulation<br>
matrix is exemplarily shown at 88 in Fig. 2 for the case<br>
N=M=4. As can be seen, the frequency/modulation frequency<br>
representation 88 has two dimensions, namely the frequency<br>
90 and the modulation frequency 92. The individual<br>
modulation values are illustrated with boxes 93 at 88.<br>
The transform means 38 passes the modulation matrix to the<br>
processing means 40. According to the present embodiment,<br>
the processing means 40 is provided to filter the<br>
modulation component out of the information signal 14. In<br>
the present exemplary case, the processing means 40<br>
therefore performs low-pass filtering on the modulation<br>
frequency components in the frequency/modulation frequency<br>
matrix. For purposes of illustration, Fig. 1 shows a<br>
diagram at 94 in which the modulation frequency is plotted<br><br>
along the x-axis and the magnitude of the modulation values<br>
is plotted along the y-axis. The diagram 94 represents a<br>
section of the modulation matrix 88 for the exemplary case<br>
of the information signal 14 of Fig. 1, i.e. the sine-<br>
modulated sine. In particular, the diagram 94 illustrates<br>
the course of the magnitudes of the modulation values along<br>
the modulation frequency for the subband with the frequency<br>
β, i.e. the carrier frequency. By the demodulation 84 by<br>
means of the mixer 34, the modulation frequency spectrum is<br>
substantially perfectly centered - at least in the case of<br>
the FFT as the transform 86 - and/or correctly aligned. In<br>
particular the modulation frequency spectrum at the carrier<br>
frequency (3 has two side bands 96 and 98 located at the<br>
modulation frequency a, i.e. the modulation frequency of<br>
the envelope 84 of the information signal 14. Furthermore,<br>
the modulation values of the modulation matrix 88 have a<br>
constant component 100 at frequency β. The sicnal<br>
processing means 40 is now designed as a low-pass filter<br>
with a filter characteristic 102 illustrated with a dashed<br>
line to remove the two side bands 96 and 98 from the<br>
frequency /modulation frequency representation 88. In t.his<br>
way, the information signal 14 is freed of its modulation<br>
component, whereupon only the carrier component remains.<br>
The thus changed modulation matrix is passed to the inverse<br>
transform means 42 by the processing means 40. The inverse<br>
transform means 42 processes the modified modulation matrix<br>
for each subband such that the block of modulation values<br>
for the respective subband, i.e. a column in the modulation<br>
matrix 88, is subjected to a transform inverse to the<br>
transform of the transform means 38, so that these<br>
modulation value blocks are converted from the<br>
frequency/modulation frequency representation back to the<br>
time/frequency representation. In this way, the inverse<br>
transform means 42 generates, from each such block of<br>
modulation values for each subband, a block of spectral<br>
values for this subband.<br><br>
From the output of the spectral values by the transform<br>
means 30, the above description mainly referred to the<br>
processing of the first M spectral values and/or of M<br>
consecutive spectral values for each subband. The<br>
processings by the means 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42,<br>
however, are also repeated for following blocks of M<br>
spectral values each for each of the N subbands, namely<br>
with an overlap of the blocks of M spectral values each of<br>
exemplarily 50% in the present case, i.e. with an overlap<br>
per subband by M/2 spectral values. In Fig. 2, the blocks<br>
are exemplarily illustrated with m = 0, m = 1 and m = 2 in<br>
the time/frequency representation 74 by exemplary arch-<br>
shaped windowing and/or weighting functions exemplarily<br>
extending over M=4 spectral values in each subband. Tor<br>
each of these blocks m, the transform means 38 finally<br>
generates a modulation matrix of M x N modulation valaes<br>
each, which are filtered and/or weighted by the signal<br>
processing means 40 in the manner described above. The<br>
inverse transform means 42, in turn, generates a block of<br>
spectral values for each subband from these modified<br>
modulation matrices 88, i.e. a matrix of modified, but<br>
still demodulated blocks of spectral values.<br>
However, the blocks of spectral values per subband output<br>
by the inverse transform means 42 differ from those<br>
obtained from the information signal 14 at the output of<br>
the windowing means 36 not only by the processing by the<br>
processing means 40, but also by the change effected by the<br>
demodulation. Therefore, the spectral value blocks are<br>
again modulated, in the modulation means 4 6, with the<br>
modulation carrier component with which they were<br>
previously demodulated. In particular, the corresponding<br>
blocks of spectral values previously multiplied by <br>
v)) are thus now multiplied by , wherein n<br>
indicates the index of the spectral value sequence of the<br>
respective subband and ω_d and/or ωd is the angular<br>
frequency of the complex modulation carrier determined by<br>
the means 32 for the respective spectral value block.<br><br>
The sequences of blocks of spectral values per subband<br>
resulting after the modulation stage 46 are now combined<br>
for each subband by the combination means 4 4 to form a<br>
uniform stream 82a-82d of spectral values per subband by<br>
overlapping the blocks of spectral values correspondingly<br>
with each other, in the present example by 50%, and<br>
combining mutually corresponding spectral values depending<br>
on the weighting function used in the windowing means 36,<br>
i.e. by adding in the case of the sine or KBD windows<br>
exemplarily given above.<br>
The streams of spectral values per subband resulting at the<br>
output of the combination means 44 represent the<br>
time/frequency representation of the processed information<br>
signal 18. The streams are received by the inverse<br>
transform means 48. In each time step n, it uses the<br>
spectral values for all subbands ωb, i.e. all spectral<br>
values a(ωb,n) with 0≤b<n to perform a transform from the></n>
frequency representation to the time representation<br>
thereon, to obtain a time block for each n, i.e. with a<br>
repetition time duration of 27πN/ωs. These time blocks are<br>
combined by the combination means 50 by an overlap of 50%<br>
in the present example and combining mutually corresponding<br>
information values in these time blocks to form a uniform<br>
stream of information values finally representing the<br>
processed information signal in the time domain 18 output<br>
at output 16.<br>
The processed information signal is illustrated at 18 in a<br>
diagram in Fig. 1, in which the x-axis is the time and the<br>
y-axis is the amplitude of the information signal 18. As<br>
can be seen, the only thing remaining is the carrier<br>
component of the information signal 14 on the input side.<br>
The modulation components and/or the envelope component 84<br>
has been removed.<br><br>
In other words, the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2 represented<br>
a processing device that used a signal-adaptive filter bank<br>
for performing a decomposition of signals into carrier and<br>
modulation components, and used the resulting<br>
representation of the modulated signals to filter them.<br>
Likewise, however, it would be possible to perform coding,<br>
encryption or compression instead of the filter processing<br>
in the signal processing means, or to otherwise modify the<br>
modulation matrices. Compared to the modulation transform<br>
methods used for audio coding described in the introduction<br>
of the specification, which perform magnitude formation,<br>
this embodiment performs a demodulation with respect to a<br>
carrier component per subband. After an estimation of this<br>
subband carrier component in the carrier frequency<br>
determination means 32, the demodulation per subband is<br>
achieved by multiplication by the complex conjugate of this<br>
component. The thus demodulated subband signals are<br>
subsequently transformed into the modulation domain by a<br>
further frequency decomposition by means of the window<br>
means 36 and the transform means 38.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 1, a DFT with 50% overlap and<br>
windowing was exemplarily used as the first transform 72,<br>
wherein, however, deviations and variations are<br>
conceivable. Several blocks of the first transform 72 were<br>
again combined by the windowing means 36 - there with an<br>
exemplary 50% overlap - and demodulated subband-wise with a<br>
complex modulator, determined by the carrier frequency<br>
determination means 32, by means of the mixer 34 and<br>
subsequently transformed with a DFT. In the previous<br>
embodiment, the frequency of this modulator was derived<br>
from the phases of the corresponding blocks of the subband<br>
to be demodulated in the carrier frequency determination<br>
means, i.e. by approximate setting of a straight line<br>
through the unwrapped phase course of the spectral values<br>
of the corresponding blocks. However, this may also be done<br>
in another way. The carrier frequency determination means<br>
32 may, for example per spectral block portion n to n+M-1,<br><br>
approximately set a plane into the phase component of all<br>
subbands in this portion. Furthermore, it would be possible<br>
that the carrier frequency determination means 32 does not<br>
perform the determination of the complex modulator block-<br>
wise, but continuously over the stream of spectral valaes<br>
per subband. For this purpose, the carrier frequency<br>
determination means 32 could, for example, first unwrap the<br>
phases of the sequence of spectral values of a respective<br>
subband, for example, low-pass filter them and then use the<br>
local increase of the filtered phase course for the<br>
adaptation of the complex modulator. Correspondingly, the<br>
modulation portion at the mixer 46 would also be changed.<br>
Generally, the carrier frequency determination means<br>
attempts to influence the phase behavior by either<br>
increasing or reducing the phase of the complex spectral<br>
values of a subband with a magnitude increasing or<br>
decreasing over the sequence such that a mean slope of the<br>
phase of the sequence of spectral values is reduced and/or<br>
the unwrapped phase course varies essentially around a<br>
fixed phase value, preferably the phase 0.<br>
Once again, attention is explicitly drawn to the fact that<br>
other types than the DFT and/or IDFT are also conceivable<br>
for the used transforms 72, 8 6 and the transform means 42<br>
and 4 8 inverse thereto. For example, the complex<br>
demodulated subband signal may also be transformed and/or<br>
spectrally decomposed into the frequency/modulation<br>
frequency representation with a real-valued transform<br>
separated according to real and imaginary part,<br>
respectively. The real part would then represent the<br>
amplitude modulation of the subband signal with respect to<br>
the carrier used for demodulation after the demodulation<br>
stage. The imaginary part would then represent the<br>
frequency modulation of this carrier. In the case of the<br>
DFT and/or IDFT for the means 38 and/or 42, the amplitude<br>
modulation component of the subband signal is reflected in<br>
the symmetric component of the DFT spectrum along the<br>
modulation frequency axis, while the frequency modulation<br><br>
component of the carrier corresponds to the asymmetric<br>
component of the DFT spectrum along the modulation<br>
frequency axis.<br>
The embodiment described above has exemplarily been<br>
illustrated with respect to a simple sine-modulated sine<br>
signal. The embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, however, is also<br>
suitable for filtering the course of the envelope of a<br>
mixture of amplitude-modulated signals of any frequency,<br>
such as amplitude-modulated tonal signals. The individual<br>
frequency components of the envelope are directly<br>
represented for consistent processing in the modulation<br>
matrix 88, in contrast to the already known magnitude-phase<br>
representation according to the modulation transform<br>
analysis methods for audio coding described in the<br>
introduction of the specification. The filtering of<br>
frequency-modulated signals of little modulation depth,<br>
i.e. with a frequency swing significantly smaller than the<br>
subband width of the first DFT, is also possible with the<br>
embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2 thus concerned an<br>
arrangement for modulation filtering which, once again<br>
expressed in other words, was based on a signal-adaptive<br>
transform, filtering in the modulation domain and a<br>
corresponding back-transform. Without signal manipulation<br>
in the modulation domain, in the present embodiment of<br>
filtering, the arrangement of Fig. 1 is perfectly<br>
reconstructing. By introducing a suitable spectral range<br>
filter, such as filter 102, i.e. an attenuation of the<br>
modulation values with increasing distance from a center<br>
modulation frequency of zero, the modulation components to<br>
be removed may be attenuated as desired. However, other<br>
types of processing of information signals in the<br>
frequency/modulation frequency representation are also<br>
conceivable. Thus, it may also be desirable to remove only<br>
the carrier. In this case, the filtering would consist in a<br>
high-pass filtering, i.e. weighting with a weighting<br><br>
function with a modulation frequency edge at a certain<br>
modulation frequency which attenuates modulation values at<br>
lower modulation frequencies more than those at modulation<br>
frequencies above that. In yet other fields of application<br>
and/or applications, the signal processing in the signal<br>
processing means 40 could consist in band-pass filtering,<br>
i.e. weighting with a weighting function dropping from a<br>
certain center modulation frequency to separate components<br>
of the information signal originating from different<br>
sources, i.e. to achieve source separation. Further<br>
applications in which the above embodiment may be used may<br>
concern audio coding for coding audio signals, the<br>
reconstruction of disturbed signals and error concealing.<br>
Generally, however, the device 10 could also be used as a<br>
music effect appliance to realize special acoustic effects<br>
in the incoming audio signal. The processings in the signal<br>
processing means 40 may accordingly assume the most various<br>
forms, such as the quantization of the modulation values,<br>
setting some modulation values to zero, weighting<br>
individual portions of the or all modulation values or the<br>
like. A further field of application would be the use of<br>
device 10 of Fig. 1 as a watermark embedder. The watermark<br>
embedder would receive an audio signal 14, wherein the<br>
processing means 40 could introduce a received watermark<br>
into the audio signal by modifying individual segments<br>
and/or modulation values according to the watermark. The<br>
selection of the segments and/or modulation values could be<br>
done differently and/or varying in time for consecutive<br>
modulation matrices and would be made such that the<br>
modifications by the watermark introduction are inaudible<br>
for the human ear in the resulting watermarked audio signal<br>
18 by psychoacoustic concealing effects.<br>
Regarding the transform means, it is to be noted that they<br>
may, of course, also be designed as filter banks generating<br>
a spectral representation by many individual band-pass<br>
filterings. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the<br>
resulting information signal 18 after processing does not<br><br>
have to be output in the time domain representation. It<br>
would further be conceivable to output the information<br>
signal, for example, in a time/spectral representation or<br>
even in the spectral/modulation spectral representation. In<br>
the latter case, it would then, of course, be necessary to<br>
ensure that, on the receiver side, the necessary modulation<br>
46 may again be performed with the suitable carrier, for<br>
example by also supplying the complex carriers varying per<br>
subband and spectral value block, which were used for the<br>
demodulation 84. In this way, the above embodiment could be<br>
used for realizing a compression method.<br>
In particular, it is to be noted that, depending on the<br>
circumstances, the inventive scheme may also be implemented<br>
in software. The implementation may be done on a digital<br>
storage medium, particularly a floppy disk or a CD with<br>
control signals that may be read out electronically, which<br>
may cooperate with a programmable computer system so that<br>
the corresponding method is executed. In general, the<br>
invention thus also consists in a computer program product<br>
with a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier<br>
for performing the inventive method when the computer<br>
program product runs on a computer. In other words, the<br>
invention may thus be realized as a computer program with a<br>
program code for performing the method when the computer<br>
program runs on a computer.<br><br>
