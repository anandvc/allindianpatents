Process for the antimicrobial treatment of fiber materials<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the treatment of fiber materials with an inclusion complex of fiber-reactive cyclodextrin derivatives with special antimicrobial agents, aqueous compositions comprising these inclusion complexes, and novel inclusion complexes.<br>
The use of antimicrobials in various textile related applications is increasingly important. Some antimicrobial substances do not have good substantivity to textile substrates, for example cotton. It is often found that when applied to textile materials the antimicrobial agent will be washed off after a few laundering cycles and the antimicrobial activity becomes diminished. Therefore, finding a process or formulation that could prolong the washing durability is scientifically interesting and commercially promising. Surprisingly, it was found that special antimicrobials can be complexed with fiber-reactive cyclodextrin derivatives. The latter is characterized by the presence of a cavity formed by its special molecular configuration. Furthermore, such fiber-reactive cyclodextrin derivatives can be covalently fixed to cotton substrates. Therefore, a controlled delivery system can be made whereby the reactive cyclodextrin acts as both an anchor to the fiber materials as well as a carrier for interested antimicrobial substance.<br>
It was found that the antimicrobial/cyclodextrin complexes, when incorporated to fiber materials, can provide prolonged washing durability. The prolonged presence of antimicrobials incorporated on fiber materials makes the substrates more hygienic, less prone to cross contamination and fresher. The latter aspect is achieved because the selected antimicrobials are able to inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms, especially gram positive bacteria, which are considered as being capable to develop odour by metabolizing certain components in sweat as well other substances that can be found on textile substrates.<br>
Another important aspect is that the performance in inhibiting the formation of odour by the presence of antimicrobials can be enhanced with such a complex. Because cyclodextrin itself has certain capacities in absorbing small odour causing molecules. Therefore, the complex, when incorporated onto the fiber materials, is able to inhibit the odour formation due to<br><br>
bacteria metabolism, as well as absorb other odours available in the environment where textile products are used, such as smoke odour.<br>
Furthermore, due to the change of physical properties of the complex, in comparison to those of the antimicrobials alone, the substantivity of antimicrobials to various textile substrates can be enhanced. Such an aspect is of interest if antimicrobials are used in laundering processes. Conventionally antimicrobials are incorporated into laundry detergent and used in laundering process. But due to poor substantivity of selected antimicrobials towards the substrate, a large portion of the antimicrobials can not be absorbed by the substrate and is washed off together with the laundry liquor. The improvement of the antimicrobial in a carrier system can therefore be benefitial in the following aspects: more efficient use of antimicrobial, less antimicrobial in the effluent and therefore less ecotoxological impact, better stability and less interactions of the antimicrobials with other agents found in common laundry detergent.<br>
The present invention, therefore, relates to a process for the antimicrobial treatment of fiber materials, comprising<br>

The cyclodextrin derivatives contain preferably 2 to 3 fiber-reactive groups.<br>
Fiber-reactive cyclodextrine derivatives are known and the preparation of such fiber-reactive cyclodextrine derivatives can be carried out according to known processes (see for example US-A-5,728,823).<br>
For example, trichlorotriazine or trifluortriazine is subjected to a condensation reaction with a compound of formula H-R10 and/or H-Rn and the resulting fiber-reactive group containing at least one chlorine or fluorine substituent is subjected to a further condensation reaction with the cyclodextrin derivative* The condensation reactions can be carried out at a temperature of 0 to 25°C in aqueous medium. It is preferred to carry out the condensation reactions under pH-control in slightly alkaline medium.<br>
Preferred as cyclodextrin is (5-cyclodextrin.<br>
The preparation of the inclusion complex can be carried out according to known methods. For example, the inclusion complexes can be prepared by combining a mixture A) containing the fiber-reactive cyclodextrin and water with a mixture B) containing the antimicrobial agent and an organic solvent. It is preferred to add either mixture A) or mixture B) in portions. The addition can be carried out at room temperature. The weight ratio of cyclodextrin/water in mixture A) is usually 0.1/1 to 1/0.1, especially 0.5/1 to 1/0.5. A weight ratio of about 1/1 is preferred for mixture A). The weight ratio of antimicrobial agent/organic solvent in mixture B) is usually 0.1/1 to 1/0.1, especially 0.5/1 to 1/0.5. A weight ratio of about 1/1 is preferred for mixture B). The amounts of mixtures A) and B) to be combined can be chosen so that the molar ratio of antimicrobial agent/cyclodextrin is usually 0.1/1 to 1/0.1, especially 0.5/1 to 1/0.5. A molar ratio of about 1/1 is preferred. Preferred organic solvents are methanol and especially ethanol. The preparation of the inclusion complex is carried out, for example, at a pH of s 7, preferably of £ 9 and especially of s 10. As the upper limit a pH, for example, of 12 is appropriate.<br><br>
During and after combination of mixtures A) and B) the resulting mixture is stirred or, if necessary, kneaded, for example for 1 to 24 hours. Then the solvents are removed, for example by drying, at a temperature of 40 to 100°C.<br>
Usually preparations of fiber-reactive inclusion complexes are carried out by first preparing the fiber-reactive cyclodextrin and then introducing the agent to be complexed. However, such a procedure has the disadvantage that the fiber-reactive group is present in all reaction steps and therefore hydrolisation of the fiber-reactive group can take place to a greater extent. Furthermore, it is common practice that the uncomplexed fiber-reactive cyclodextrin is dried after preparation and is dissolved again in water for preparation of the inclusion complex. Such a procedure has the disadvantage that again hydrolisation of the fiber-reactive group can take place during the additional drying step.<br>
It has now been found that hydrolisation can be minimised if a process is used which comprises<br>
a)	forming an inclusion complex of cyclodextrin with at least one of the antimicrobial agents given before; and then<br>
b)	introducing at least one fiber-reactive group into the inclusion complex obtained according to step a).<br>
Preferably, the inclusion complex obtained according to step a) is processed directly without intermediate drying.<br>
Step a) is usually carried out at temperatures of 20 to 80°C, especially 40 to 70°C, in an aqueous medium containing the non-reactive cyclodextrin and the antimicrobial agent. The weight ratio of cyclodextrin/antimicrobial agent is usually 0.1/1 to 1/0.05, especially 0.5/1 to 1/0.1. A weight ratio of about 1/1 to 1/0.1 is preferred. After preparation it is preferred that the non-reactive inclusion complex is isolated, for example by filtration, or the reaction mixture obtained according to step a) is used as such. Preferably, the product obtained is not dried before carrying out step b). This means that the wet cake obtained after filtration is used as such for step b) or, alternatively, the reaction mixture obtained according to step a) is used directly for step b).<br><br>
Step b) is usually carried out at temperatures of 0 to 40°C, especially 0 to 25°C, in an aqueous medium containing the non-reactive inclusion complex obtained according to step a) and the fiber-reactive group. The weight ratio of non-reactive inclusion complex/fiber-reactive group is usually 0.1/1 to 1/0.05, especially 0.5/1 to 1/0.1, more peferably 1/1 to 1/0.1.<br>
After preparation of the fiber-reactive inclusion complex the product can be dried, preferably under mild conditions in order to minimise hydrolisation of the fiber-reactive group. Such drying can, for example, be carried out by evaporation at low pressure (like 0.01 to 0.9 bar, especially 0.01 to 0.2 bar), or in a paddle drier or in a spray tower. The temperatures to be used for the drying step can vary depending on the drying method used. For evaporation or drying in a paddle drier temperatures like 20 to 80°C are preferred. Drying in a spray tower can, for example, be carried out at temperatures of 100 to 200°C.<br>
The application of the inclusion complex, as a rule, is carried out in aqueous medium. The concentration of the inclusion complex in the aqueous bath is preferably 0.1 to 100 g per liter, especially 2 to 100 g/liter. Highly preferred is a concentration of 2 to 50 g/liter, especially 2 to 25 g/liter. It is preferred to carry out the application of the inclusion complex at a pH of from 4 to 7.<br>
The application can be carried out according to well-known textile related processes; for example according to conventional padding processes. For example, the fiber material is passed through an aqueous liquor containing the inclusion complex, the textile material is squeezed to a defined liquor pick-up rate and then, if desired, a heat treatment can be carried out. The liquor pick-up rate is usually 40% to 200% by weight, especially 50% to 150% by weight, based on the weight of the fiber material.<br>
The heat treatment can be carried out at a temperature of 60 to 200°C, especially 90 to 200"C. Preferred is a temperature of 150 to 200°C. Prior to the heat treatment, it is preferred to dry the fiber materials.<br>
The padding process is usually carried out as a continuous process wherein the fiber material is continuously passed through the aqueous liquor containing the inclusion complex.<br><br>
Furthermore, the application can also be carried out according to known exhaustion processes. According to this process the fiber materials are immersed into a bath. The temperature to be used can vary between 20 to 100°C.<br>
Fiber materials which can be treated with the inclusion complex are fiber materials comprising, for example, natural or synthetic polyamide (like wool, silk, nylon) and cellulose-containing textile materials of all kinds, for example regenerated or especially natural cellulose fibres, such as cotton, linen, jute, hemp, ramie and polyester; or blends containing the above fiber materials, like polyamide/polyester, polyester/cotton and polyester/wool.<br>
Preferred fiber materials are those comprising wool, synthetic polyamide and especially cellulose-containing fiber materials, preferably cotton.<br>
The fiber material can be in different forms of presentation, as woven or knitted fabrics or as piece goods such as knitgoods, nonwoven textiles, carpets, yarn or staple fibres.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is directed to aqueous compositions comprising the above inclusion complexes. As to these compositions the above meanings and preferences apply.<br>
Another object of the present invention are the inclusion complexes given above. As to these inclusion complexes the above meanings and preferences apply.<br>
In the following Examples, percentages are by weight.<br>

7.5 g of the antimicrobial agent of formula<br><br><br>
and 7,5 g of ethanol are mixed to form Mixture B).<br>
Mixture A) is transferred to a Kenwood-kneader and Mixture B) is added in portions during kneading. After all of Mixture B) has been added kneading is continued for 4 hours* The resulting product is put into a dryer and the solvent is evaporated at a temperature of 60*C. Finally, the product is ground in a mortar.<br>
