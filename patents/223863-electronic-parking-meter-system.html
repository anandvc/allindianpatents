				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Field of the invention :<br>
The field of the present invention is parking meters<br>
and more particularly an electronic parking meter system<br>
comprising an electronic parking meter coupled with a<br>
sensor for positively sensing unobtrusively the presence or<br>
absence of a vehicle in a specified parking space<br>
controlled by the sensor and electronic parking metel.<br>
In the present invention an induction coil mounted below the<br>
surface of the parking area is used to provide positive signals to<br>
the electronically operated parking meter and a cpu upon both the<br>
entrance of a vehicle into the parking space and the movement of<br>
the vehicle from the parking space.<br>
Moreover, the detecting system is battery operated and the<br>
battery life is extended by duty cycle operation of the detector<br>
system, whereby only a small portion of a detecting cycle is<br>
actually employed for detecting the status of the parking<br>
space.<br>
2. Related Art:<br>
Parking meters have traditionally been used to raise revenue.<br>
Such devices have included a timer and a winding mechanism<br>
requiring coins. More recently, electronic meters have been<br>
developed which include an electronic timer with an LCD time<br>
indicator.<br>
With the advent of the electronic meter, attempts have been<br>
made to make the meter interactive with vehicle traffic in the<br>
associated parking space. One way to obtain information about<br>
vehicle traffic at parking spaces is to couple the parking meter to<br>
a vehicle sensor. The vehicle sensor can detect when a vehicle<br>
enters a parking space as well as when the vehicle leaves. One<br>
such system uses an infra-red light beam to detect vehicle presence<br>
at a parking space.<br>
Individual parking meter systems have each utilized different<br>
vehicle sensors, such as an infra-red light beam, ultrasonic<br>
systems and inductance type sensors to detect the presence or<br>
absence of a vehicle in an associated parking space.<br>
One problem with light beam detection is that the beam does<br>
not distinguish between a vehicle and any other solid object. Thus,<br>
the system could be disabled by simply covering the window from<br>
which the light beam is emitted with a piece of tape or cardboard.<br>
In addition, false activity could occur with the opening of a door<br>
or other movement in front of the meter sensor. Even temperature<br>
or humidity changes could cause problems. Consequently, interest<br>
remains in developing an electronically controlled parking meter<br>
system that overcomes the aforementioned problems and is capable of<br>
accurately detecting vehicle traffic at a parking space.<br>
There are a number of known parking meter vehicle detector<br>
systems, namely:<br>
(1) USP#3,873,964; VEHICLE DETECTION; Potter<br>
The loop oscillator of the vehicle detector system<br>
continually oscillates at the resonant frequency during normal<br>
operation of the system and digital circuitry in the system<br>
measures the frequency of the loop oscillator by a cycle-counting<br>
technique. An automatic timing circuit generates a reference frame<br>
time for the frequency counting measurement. The reference frame<br>
time is a function of the desired operational sensitivity of the<br>
system and of the resonant frequency of the loop and lead-in loop<br>
oscillator frequency-determining circuit. A vehicle is detected<br>
whenever an increase of loop oscillator frequency counts occurs<br>
from one reference frame time to the next, and when that increase<br>
exceeds a predetermined threshold.<br>
(2) USP#3,875,555; VEHICLE DETECTION SYSTEM; Potter; Indicator<br>
Controls, Corp.<br>
The magnetic inductance vehicle detection system includes<br>
an embedded wire loop to sense the presence of a vehicle in ,a<br>
roadway. A first oscillator connected to the loop changes<br>
frequency as the loop inductance changes due to the presence of a<br>
vehicle. A second oscillator with a frequency independent of the<br>
loop inductance is used as a reference. Logic circuitry emits a<br>
signal whenever the oscillator loop frequency exceeds a<br>
predetermined frequency beyond a predetermined frequency<br>
differential.<br>
(3) USP#Re29511; PARKING METER; Rubenstein<br>
The parking meter electrically indicates "remaining time"<br>
and electrically operates only in the presence of a vehicle and<br>
when there is "paid-for" time on the meter. Unused time by one<br>
departing motorist is cancelled.<br>
(4) USP#3.943,339; INDUCTIVE LOOP DETECTOR SYSTEM; Koerner et<br>
al.; Canoga Controls Corporation<br>
An oscillator circuit is operatively connected to each<br>
one of multiple inductance loops each located in a given space in<br>
a roadway and the loop frequency is monitored by a counter<br>
measuring the time duration or period of loop oscillator cycles.<br>
The monitored oscillator cycle is then compared with a reference<br>
duration to determine whether the loop oscillator frequency has<br>
increased or decreased.<br>
(5) USP#3,989,932; INDUCTIVE LOOP VEHICLE DETECTOR; Koerner;<br>
Canoga Controls Corporation<br>
Oscillator circuitry is connected to an inductance loop<br>
for detecting the presence of vehicles and the loop frequency is<br>
monitored by a loop counter for counting the loop oscillator<br>
cycles. A duration counter measures the time duration of a fixed<br>
number of loop oscillator cycles and the count is compared with an<br>
adaptable reference duration to determine an increase,or decrease<br>
in the loop inductance, thereby determining the presence or absence<br>
of a vehicle in the inductance loop.<br>
(6) USP#4.358.749; OBJECT DETECTION; Clark; Redland Automation<br>
Limited<br>
An inductive sensing loop is connected with an oscillator<br>
provided with a voltage controlled capacitor in a phase locked loop<br>
providing a reference frequency (VCO). The voltage of the<br>
capacitor varies in the presence of a vehicle and this varying<br>
voltage is applied to an auxiliary VCO whose frequency is<br>
accordingly varied and analyzed for detection purposes. A<br>
microcomputer includes a clock source that is a reference frequency<br>
source.<br>
(7) USP#4,472,706; VEHICLE PRESENCE LOOP DETECTOR; Hodge et<br>
al.; Not Assigned<br>
A tuned circuit having a magnetic field-producing<br>
induction loop produces changing signals in the presence of a<br>
vehicle. A first signal amplifier amplifies the signal from the<br>
loop and a second amplifier responds to the positive or negative<br>
polarity input from the first amplifier to provide an output in<br>
response to a rapidly changing input which activates a logic gate<br>
for sensing the polarity of the second amplifier output and<br>
producing a gated output signal indicative of the presence or<br>
absence of a vehicle within the loop.<br>
(8) USP#4,491,841; SELF-ADJUSTING INDUCTIVE OBJECT-PRESENCE<br>
DETECTOR; Clark; Sarasota Automation Limited<br>
An oscillator includes an inductive sensing loop and a<br>
first counter samples the oscillator frequency or period and the<br>
resulting count is applied as a preset reference to a second<br>
counter which is counted down in one sample period while a new<br>
count is counted by the first counter. The residue in the second<br>
counter at the end of a sample period is indicative of the presence<br>
or absence of a vehicle. Provision is made for detection of the<br>
departure of a vehicle by use of additional counters.<br>
(9) USP#4,680,717; MICROPROCESSOR CONTROLLED LOOP DETECTOR<br>
SYSTEM; Martin; Indicator Controls Corporation<br>
A microprocessor-controlled loop detection system is<br>
connected to a number of inductive loops which are individually<br>
located to detect the presence of motor vehicles above the loops to<br>
control motor vehicles at a traffic intersection. A common<br>
oscillator is connected to each loop on a time shared basis and the<br>
microprocessor counts the number of cycles of the oscillator output<br>
signal to determine the oscillator frequency.<br>
(10) USP#5,153,525; VEHICLE DETECTOR WITH SERIES RESONANT<br>
OSCILLATOR DRIVE; Hoeckman et al.<br>
The series resonant oscillator circuit drives an<br>
inductive load including an inductive sensor and a detection system<br>
using the series resonant oscillator circuit and inductive sensor.<br>
An inductive load is connected in the series path with a<br>
capacitative impedance. An oscillator signal provides power to the<br>
series path and is controlled as a function of current sensed in<br>
the series path. The frequency of the oscillator signal changes as<br>
a function of changes in the inductance of the inductive sensor.<br>
(11) USP#5,570,771: ELECTRONIC PARKING METER AND SYSTEM;<br>
Jacobs<br>
The parking meter system uses a low-current drain<br>
electronic parking meter and a mobile transceiver. A sonar<br>
transducer detects the presence of a vehicle in an adjacent parking<br>
space and an infra red transceiver communicates; with the mobile<br>
transceiver. A microprocessor responds to electrical signals from<br>
the various detectors to provide data displayable on a display and<br>
transmittable by the IR transceiver to the mobile transceiver. The<br>
meter is entirely battery operated and can operate for an extended<br>
period of time, for example, six months to one year, without<br>
battery replacement.<br>
(12) USP#5,903,520; ELECTRONIC MODULE FOR CONVENTIONAL PAPKING<br>
METER; Dee et al.<br>
The electronic module comprises a shell attachable to a<br>
conventional parking meter and a meter condition sensor for<br>
detecting, from a distant point, time and violative conditions of<br>

ultrasonic vehicle sensor affixed to the shell for detecting a<br>
parked vehicle. The electronic module further includes electronic<br>
circuitry with a power source for operating the module; means for<br>
receiving a first signal from the meter condition sensor and a<br>
second signal from the vehicle sensor; means for processing the<br>
first and second signals and means for transmitting a coded message<br>
to a remote receiver.<br>
(13) USP#5,936,55l; VEHICLE DETECTOR WITH IMPROVED REFERENCE<br>
TRACKING; Allen &amp; Potter<br>
A vehicle detector having improved reference tracking<br>
routines in both the NO CALL and CALL directions and wherein CALL<br>
direction tracking includes rate sensitive tracking wherein the<br>
reference is only changed in response to small fluctuations in loop<br>
frequency due to drift, and one or more fixed decrementing tracking<br>
intervals during which the reference is decremented at a fixed rate<br>
for a maximum predetermined period of time. CALL direction<br>
tracking also included infinite tracking during which the reference<br>
is decremented to an end value representative of loop inductance<br>
prior to the end value representative of loop inductance prior to<br>
the generation of a CALL signal. No CALL tracking enables<br>
reference updating only after the loop frequency has stabilized for<br>
a minimum period of time, a minimum number of loop frequency<br>
samples or both.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an electronically<br>
controlled parking meter system which employs an electronically<br>
operable parking meter in combination with an inductive loop coil<br>
used for vehicle detection. Over the past forty years inductive<br>
loops have been used for many types of systems requiring vehicle<br>
detection. Such systems include traffic control signal systems,<br>
automatic gates, drive thru restaurants, etc. Inductive loops,<br>
when properly installed, have proven to be very reliable for the<br>
purpose of vehicle detection.<br>
In a first, separate aspect of the invention, an<br>
electronically operable parking meter may be coupled to an<br>
induction coil vehicle detection sensor located or embedded in the<br>
surface of the parking space for selectively controlling the<br>
electronically operable parking meter responsive to the inductive<br>
loop sensor. A vehicle entering or leaving the parking space<br>
causes a change in the apparent inductance of the inductive loop<br>
and the resulting signal output from the sensor may be used to<br>
control the electronically controlled parking meter and associated<br>
control circuitry. The electronically operable parking meter<br>
system may be used to initialize or reset the parking meter when<br>
the inductive loop sensor indicates the entry or departure of a<br>
vehicle from the associated parking space. The electronically<br>
operable parking meter system may also be used to accumulate data<br>
associated with the activity of the particular parking space; such<br>
as number of vehicles using the space, duration of elapsed time for<br>
eah or all vehicles using the space, etc.<br>
In a second, separate aspect of the present invention,<br>
multiple electronically operable parking meters may be coupled to<br>
a single power supply. Each electronically operable parking meter<br>
may be coupled to a separate inductive loop vehicle sensor for<br>
selectively controlling the parking meter responsive to its sensor,<br>
as in the electronically operable parking meter of the first,<br>
separate aspect.<br>
In a third, separate aspect of the present invention, the<br>
electronically operable parking meter of the second, separate<br>
aspect may include a remote data processing unit (DPU). The remote<br>
DPU may be coupled to each electronically operable parking meter.<br>
The remote data processing unit may be utilized for gathering data<br>
in order to obtain statistics on vehicle traffic, traffic patterns,<br>
and other information, which could be utilized for establishing<br>
more efficient use of parking spaces. This system would be<br>
deployed for monitoring and/or controlling a large number of<br>
parking spaces; for example, a parking garage, or the length of an<br>
entire street, etc.<br>
A fourth aspect of the present invention is that the parking<br>
meters are electrically operated as opposed to mechanical operation<br>
of known parking meters.<br>
A fifth aspect of the present invention relates to the use of<br>
solar energy for providing the electric power to operate the<br>
electronically operable parking meter system, and in particular the<br>
electronically operable parking meter(s) and the associated<br>
electronics. This involves at least the consideration of using<br>
solar panels in ambient sunlight as well as direct sunlight since<br>
the electronically operable parking meter system may be utilized in<br>
locations where direct sunlight is not available or only<br>
intermittently available.<br>
A sixth aspect of the present invention relates to the<br>
modification of existing parking meters, and particularly<br>
mechanically operable parking meters, to enable them to function in<br>
the electronically operable parking meter system of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A seventh aspect of the present invention concerns the<br>
economical optimization of electronically operable parking meter<br>
systems by controlling the electronically operable parking meter so<br>
that the meter is "zeroed" when the inductive loop sensor<br>
associated with the meter detects that a vehicle has vacated the<br>
parking space controlled by the inductive loop.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide an electronically operable parking meter system which is<br>
capable of detecting the vehicle traffic at particular parking<br>
spaces.<br>
More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide positive and accurate sensing of the presence or absence of<br>
a vehicle in a particular parking space within a given vehicle<br>
parking area.<br>
It is a feature that the sensors employed by the<br>
electronically operable parking meter system of the present<br>
invention are inductive loop sensors embedded in the surface of a<br>
parking space.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that the inductive<br>
loop sensor is unobtrusive and not hindered by the presence of<br>
surface objects in the vicinity of the parking space.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to connect<br>
a plurality of electronically operated parking meters to a single<br>
electrical power source, which may include electric batteries,<br>
mains power and/or solar powered electrical energy.<br>
It is yet another feature that rechargeable batteries in<br>
conjunction with solar power energy may be used to provide<br>
emergency electrical power for the electronically controlled<br>
parking meter system of the present invention in the event of<br>
failure of a main power supply.<br>
It is yet another advantage of the electronically controlled<br>
parking meter system of the present invention that the electrical<br>
power for operating the electronically operable parking meters,<br>
inductive loop sensors, and the DPU is automatically rechargeable.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to enable<br>
existing parking meters to be modified to operate electronically.<br>
Still another feature of the present invention is to provide<br>
electrical circuits and connections to existing mechanically<br>
operated meters to enable them to operate electronically.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is that the<br>
cost of a parking meter system may be reduced by modifying existing<br>
mechanical type parking meters to operate electrically.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to increase the<br>
the economical operation of electronically operable parking meter<br>
systems.<br>
Yet another advantage of the electronically operable parking<br>
meter system of the present invention is that the parking time<br>
purchased for a specific vehicle can only be used by that vehicle.<br>
When any vehicle vacates the parking space the remaining time is<br>
lost; and the next arriving vehicle must purchase new time for the<br>
use of the parking space.<br>
Yet another advantage of the electronically operable parking<br>
meter system of the present invention is that a limited amount of<br>
parking time may be provided, possibly at no cost, for arriving<br>
vehicles. Further, the vehicle would not be able to purchase<br>
additional time for the space. This operation of the<br>
electronically operable parking meter system would control the<br>
allowed time of use for each vehicle. Limited parking time is<br>
common practice near Post Offices, banks, etc.<br>
The vehicle detection system/parking meter system produces a<br>
variety of value-added parking meter capabilities. The vehicle<br>
detector system utilizes ultra low power "wire loop detection"<br>
technology and a programmable microprocessor to interface with a<br>
digital or electronic parking meter. The vehicle detector reliably<br>
detects the arrival and departure of automobiles and motorcycles<br>
from a given parking space and sends the appropriate<br>
arrival/departure signal to the digital meter. This signal then<br>
enables the parking meter to accomplish any number or pre-<br>
programmed functions.<br>
The value added functionality includes:<br>
(1) Reset the digital parking meter to zero when the parking<br>
space is vacated, thus significantly increasing meter revenue in<br>
high demand situations. Independent research reveals that average<br>
revenue increase approximately 27% in high demand parking locations<br>
when using this technique.<br>
(2) Prevent "meter feeding" by not posting additional time fpr<br>
over-limit payments until after the parking spaces has been vacated,<br>
thus forcing parking space turnover and, in effect, increasing<br>
overall parking capacity.<br>
(3) Automatically allocate free time as the parking space is<br>
occupied. This will enable very short term parking spaces in front<br>
of commercial establishments like dry cleaners and convenience<br>
stores to be more effectively managed.<br>
(4) Track all parking space related events, making it possible<br>
to analyze this data to determine how to most cost effectively<br>
deploy parking resources.<br>
For many years the ubiquitous mechanically operated parking<br>
meter has toiled in anonymity, quietly taking quarters and<br>
dispensing 10-3 0 minutes of parking privileges. This "ironclad"<br>
version of the mechanical kitchen timer has been the standard for<br>
parking control in cities across the nation for decades.<br>
However, several years ago, the old mechanical meter began to<br>
be replaced by a newer, more modern alternative, namely the new<br>
electronic or digital meter that utilizes an LCD read out and far<br>
fewer moving parts. It was the first real improvement in parking<br>
meters in many years. The meter offered the municipalities<br>
utilizing it few additional benefits other than fewer parts to<br>
break or replace.<br>
However, with the present invention there is a parking system<br>
which redefines the way parking authorities monitor, track and<br>
enforce metered parking spaces in their cities or municipalities.<br>
This system enables a digital parking meter to become a data<br>
collection device that can both control and monitor a range of<br>
activities in a given parking space.<br>
While raising parking rates is an unpopular step as<br>
perceived by municipal managers, the technology of the present<br>
invention can increase parking revenues without raising parking<br>
rates. Additionally, with the ability to collect and analyze<br>
parking space occupancy and turnover data, the present invention<br>
provides a parking authority with the information to enable it to<br>
save money, by making more efficient use of all of the parking<br>
resources.<br>
The present invention utilizes a programmable microprocessor<br>
that links the digital parking meter directly to the parking space<br>
by utilizing loop detection technology. Traffic engineers have<br>
used traditional high voltage loop detection technology to manage<br>
traffic signals for years. Wires embedded in the pavement at<br>
intersections sense when a vehicle is stopped at a signal and<br>
changes the light. The vehicle detection system of the present<br>
invention works substantially the same way only with an ultra low<br>
power detection system. A wire is run from the parking meter, down<br>
the inside of the meter pole and is embedded in the pavement in the<br>
form of a coil. The coil is installed in the parking space<br>
associated with the parking meter. When a vehicle enters the<br>
parking space, the meter is signaled by the vehicle detection<br>
system, the event is time-stamped, and whatever meter functions<br>
have been preprogrammed are initiated. The process is repeated<br>
when the vehicle leaves the parking space as the vehicle detectpr<br>
system notifies the digital meter of that event.<br>
One principal feature of the invention is the "time sweep"<br>
function. When a customer leaves the parking space and there is<br>
still time remaining on the parking meter, the vehicle detection<br>
system resets the timer to zero. In high demand situations, this<br>
feature will enable the parking authority to generate significantly<br>
greater revenue. Independent research confirms that the benefit of<br>
this feature is an improvement in revenue of 10 to 40% and an<br>
average of 27% in high demand spaces. With the present invention,<br>
meter revenue that was previously limited to a fixed number of<br>
coins per day can now become variable bassd upon usage. Since many<br>
municipalities rely heavily on parking meter revenue to fund their<br>
operating budgets, it has been discovered that the potential of<br>
being able to generate a significant increase in revenues, without<br>
raising the price of parking, is a key selling point for the<br>
present invention.<br>
On a "stand-alone" basis, the electronic single-space parking<br>
meter has a flexibility that has previously not been available to<br>
the parking authority. The electronic parking meter now knows<br>
where it is, who it is, the time of day, the day of the week and<br>
the day of the year.<br>
All of these features combine to allow a wider range of<br>
benefits to the parking system operator. By virtue of flexible<br>
internal programming the electronic parking meter can:<br>
(1) Change rate structures several times a day;<br>
(2) Put itself to "sleep" during specified periods;<br>
(3) Recognize that it is out of order and display that<br>
information;<br>
(4) More accurately discriminate valid from invalid payment<br>
tokens (coins, etc.);<br>
(5) Accept electronic payment in lieu of cash.<br>
The present invention expands these features by providing<br>
information about the real time occupancy of the parking space that<br>
is controlled by its associated electronic meter. When the vehicle<br>
detector system of the present invention is connected to the<br>
electronic meter described above, the electronic meter may be<br>
programmed to add "free" time to the parking clock when a vehicle<br>
arrives in a parking space, and remove remaining time when the<br>
vehicle leaves. The electronic meter can also be programmed to<br>
disregard any coins deposited after a full time limits worth of<br>
time has been purchased by the current occupant (also known as<br>
Meter-feeding), and resetting itself to function normally after the<br>
current occupant departs the space.<br>
The newest electronic meters are capable of storing a vast<br>
number of incident records in NOVRAM (non-volatile random access<br>
memory) to be later retrieved and analyzed in addition to the<br>
features listed for the older model, above. These incident records<br>
reveal the exact date and time of any pre-programmed transaction.<br>
For example, a transaction record can be stored every time a<br>
payment token is inserted into the meter. If the token is deemed<br>
valid, the value is displayed on the parking clock and that<br>
transaction is stored. If the coin is judged invalid, the<br>
transaction record shows that fact and no time is added to the<br>
parking clock. A record can be stored should the electronic meter<br>
become dysfunctional, showing that exact time and date. When the<br>
electronic meter is restored to operability, a record is stored<br>
noting that event.<br>
With the addition of the vehicle detector system of the<br>
present invention to the new electronic parking meter as briefly<br>
described above, a transaction record can be stored showing the<br>
exact date and time of the arrival of a vehicle and the exact date<br>
and time of departure. This data, when combined with the other<br>
records being stored, can provide a wide variety of real-time<br>
management information to the parking manager. Among other facts,<br>
when the vehicle detection system of the present invention is<br>
employed, the analysis can show:<br>
(1) Daily occupancy;<br>
(2) Daily Space Turnover;<br>
(3) Over-limit stays and amount of time in violation:<br>
(4) Length of stay for each occupant;<br>
(5) Duration of vacant time; and<br>
(6) Time-span of highest usage.<br>
When the above data are combined with data collected by<br>
an electronic citation issuance system, the parking manager can<br>
learn which enforcement tactics work best in subsections of the on-<br>
street parking system. The deployment of repair and enforcement<br>
personnel can be managed based on legitimate data retrieved from<br>
discrete areas within the system, thereby saving many labor hours<br>
of unproductive time.<br>
Thus a first object of the present invention is directed to an<br>
electronically controlled parking meter system which employs an<br>
electronically operable parking meter in combination with a low<br>
power, battery-operated vehicle detection system employing an<br>
induction coil.<br>
Therefore in a first feature of the invention, an<br>
electronically operable parking meter is coupled to a detector for<br>
detecting the status of an induction coil vehicle detection sensor<br>
located or embedded in the surface of the associated parking space<br>
for selectively controlling the electronically operable parking<br>
meter. A vehicle entering or leaving the parking space causes a<br>
change in the apparent inductance in the induction coil and the<br>
resulting signal output is used to control the electronically<br>
controlled parking meter and associated control circuitry. The<br>
electronically operable detector parking meter system of the<br>
invention is used to re-initialize the electronic parking meter<br>
when the induction coil sensor indicates the entry or departure of<br>
a vehicle from the associated parking space.<br>
Each electronic parking meter includes a preformed induction<br>
coil comprising several turns of wire and a specified perimeter.<br>
The wire leads from the coil to the detector electronics are<br>
twisted to form a single pair conductor. This pre-formed loop<br>
construction is advantageous as it simplifies installation and also<br>
insures that the detector loop is correct when installed. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the coils each comprise four<br>
turns of wire and have an approximate perimeter of ten feet.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
parking meter detection system wherein each of the detectors and<br>
electronically operable parking meters are operated by separate,<br>
independently operable battery power supplies.<br>
The detector of the invention utilizes a duty cycle ON/OFF<br>
technique to preserve battery power and wherein the detector<br>
operates at a preferred frequency of 8 0 KHz and is ON for<br>
approximately 12.5 ms and is OFF for 2.5 sec. minus 12.5 ms. Thus,<br>
the detector is ON for approximately only 0.5% of the duty cycle of<br>
the detector. This conserves the battery power of the detector so<br>
that it may actually last longer than the other battery in the<br>
electronic parking meter.<br>
A third, object of the present invention is to include a<br>
microprocessor in the detector for providing serial control and<br>
information data to the electronically operable parking meter.<br>
A fourth object of the present invention is that both the<br>
detector and the associated parking meter are electronically<br>
operated.<br>
A fifth object of the present invention concerns the<br>
economical optimization of parking meter systems by controlling the<br>
electronically operable parking meters so that the meter is<br>
"zeroed" when the induction coil sensor associated with the meter<br>
detects that a vehicle has vacated the parking space controlled by<br>
the induction coil.<br>
Other and further advantages will appear hereinafter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT:<br>
Turning in detail to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates an<br>
inductive loop-controlled, electronically operable parking meter<br>
system in accordance with the invention. The curbside parking<br>
meter stand 2 supports two electronically operable parking meters<br>
4 and 6. The two inductive loops 8 and 10 are embedded in the<br>
pavement in the parking spaces corresponding to the parking meters.<br>
The right and left induction loops 8 and 10 are connected to the<br>
right and left electronically operable parking meters 4 and 6,<br>
respectively.<br>
Inductive coils 8 and 10 each comprise several turns of<br>
insulated wire and are each wound to a specific size perimeter.<br>
The loops may be shaped as round, square, octagonal, etc. Further<br>
the inductive loops may be preformed prior to installation, or<br>
they may be wound with a single conductor wire using the saw cut in<br>
the pavement as the form. Leads 11 and 12 from the loops 8 and 10<br>
are twisted together to form single pairs of conductors. The<br>
twisted pair 11 from loop 8 connects to the electronic circuitry of<br>
parking meter 4 and the twisted pair 12 from 10 connects to the<br>
parking meter 6. Parking meters 4 and 6 each provide electrical<br>
currents to the loops 8 and 10, thus crating independent electrical<br>
fields in the proximity of the two inductive loops. Whenever a<br>
vehicle enters the electrical field created by loop 8 a disturbance<br>
to that field occurs and the electronic circuitry in parking meter<br>
4 establishes the presence of a vehicle in the zone assigned to<br>
parking meter 4. Whenever a vehicle enters the electrical field<br>
created by loop 10 a disturbance to that field occurs and the<br>
electronic circuitry in parking meter 6 establishes the presence of<br>
a vehicle in the zone assigned to parking meter 6.<br>
The system may use a solar energy power supply. Systems<br>
using a solar power supply may have a solar panel located either at<br>
or apart from the electronically operable parking meter stand 2.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an electronically operable parking meter<br>
system using solar power with a solar panel 12 located apart from<br>
the parking meter stand 2.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a cut-away view of an inductive loop<br>
controlled electronically operable parking meter system. The<br>
hollow parking meter stand 2 contains a controller 14, a 12 volt dc<br>
battery 16, a solar power regulator 18, a section of conduit 20 and<br>
a steel cover 22. Brackets (not shown) support the electronic<br>
controller 14, the 12-volt battery 16 and the solar power regulator<br>
18, which are connected to the steel cover. Preferably, the<br>
electronic controller 14 comprises a printed circuit board and<br>
electronic components.<br>
The solar panel 12 is electronically connected to the solar<br>
battery regulator 18. The solar battery regulator 18 is<br>
electronically connected to the 12 vdc battery 16. Similarly the<br>
12 vdc battery 16 is electronically connected to the electronic<br>
controller 14. The section of conduit 20 extends from the bottom<br>
of the parking meter stand 2, through a concrete block footing 24,<br>
into the ground near the base of the parking meter stand 2.<br>
A solar panel 12 is located on a support post 26 apart from<br>
the parking meter stand 2. The solar panel 12 is electronically<br>
connected to a junction box 28 located at the base of the support<br>
post 26. The junction box 28 may be located below ground.<br>
Insulated electrical wires 29 connect from the junction box,<br>
through the section of conduit 20, to the solar power regulator 18<br>
located within the parking meter stand. Communication wires 31<br>
lead from the junction box 28, through the section of conduit 20,<br>
to the electronic controller 14 located within the parking meter<br>
stand 2.<br>
The wire which forms the coils 8, 10, described above, extend<br>
back to the electronic controllers 14 within the parking meters 4<br>
and 6 mounted on stand 2 via the section of conduit 20.<br>
The inductive loops 8 and 10 are composed of, for example,<br>
number 16 AWG stranded copper wire covered with insulation suited<br>
for direct burial in the pavement. The wire leads feeding to and<br>
from the inductive loops 8 and 10 are twisted together in a helical<br>
configuration to minimize and control the electrical field emitted<br>
from the pair.<br>
There may be one or more parking meters attached to the<br>
parking meter stand 2. A metal pipe 30 extends horizontally from<br>
a side of the parking meter stand 2 and curves vertically upward.<br>
The electronically operable parking meter 4 or 6 may be mounted at<br>
the end of the vertical segment of the metal pipe 30. Figure 2<br>
shows the preferred configuration of two parking meters 4 and 6<br>
attached to the meter stand 2 in the manner described.<br>
It should be evident from the foregoing description that the<br>
parking meters used with the present invention are electrically, as<br>
opposed to mechanically, activated either by solar energy, battery<br>
power or ac power from a mains supply, or a combination of all<br>
three types of electrical power. The electrical operation of the<br>
parking meters of the present invention represents a significant<br>
departure from the prior use of mechanically operated parking<br>
meters. The features and advantages of electrically operated<br>
parking meters will become more evident from the following<br>
description of the electronically operable parking meter system of<br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 3A is a schematic diagram of the wiring system of the<br>
induction loop controlled electronically operated parking meter<br>
system. Inductive loop 8 connects to the electronic controller 14<br>
within the parking meter stand 2 to terminals 100B of a terminal<br>
strip 32. A separate inductive loop 10 connects to the electronic<br>
controller 14 within the parking meter stand 2 to terminals 102B of<br>
the terminal strip 32. Inductive loops 8 and 10 form two separate<br>
inductive sensor loops, as described above, for use with two<br>
electronically controlled parking meters. This is an example of a<br>
dual electronically controlled parking meter system.<br>
After forming the respective coils, the conductors 8 and 10<br>
travel back to the terminal strip 32, where they are connected<br>
through to the electronic controller 14. Figure 3B shows two such<br>
configurations, as would exist in the case of a dual electronically<br>
controlled parking meter.<br>
The following is an explanation of the operation of the<br>
electronic controller 14 under various conditions of time displayed<br>
on the meter and the presence or absence of a vehicle in the<br>
controlled parking space. (1) When there is no time displayed on<br>
the electronically operable parking meter, power consumption is<br>
minimized by de-energizing the inductor loop sensor channels. (2)<br>
With no time displayed on the electronically operable parking<br>
meter, a vehicle entering or leaving the inductor sensor loop does<br>
not effect the sensor electronics nor cause any reset pulse to<br>
appear. (3) When time is displayed, the corresponding channel is<br>
energized and initiated to produce a resetting pulse for any<br>
vehicle leaving the inductor loop; and at that time the<br>
electronically operable meter is set to display "zero" time. (4)<br>
When no time is displayed, the flasher output is activated when the<br>
presence of a vehicle is indicated in the controlled space. (5)<br>
When a vehicle is present and there is time displayed, the<br>
electronic controller provides no signal output.<br>
The electronically operable parking meter system may use a<br>
solar power energy supply. In the preferred system, the external<br>
solar panel 12 is electronically connected to a solar battery<br>
regulator 18. Similarly, the battery regulator 18 is<br>
electronically connected to the 12 vdc battery 16. The 12 vdc<br>
battery 16 is electrically connected to the terminal strip 32, and<br>
the terminal strip is electrically connected to the electronic<br>
controller 14.<br>
The solar panel 12 may be mounted a distance from the<br>
electronically operable parking meters 4 and 6 as illustrated in<br>
Figures 1A and 2, or the solar panel 12 may be mounted between<br>
electronically operable parking meters 4 and 6 as schematically<br>
indicated in Figure 3A. Figures 3B and 3C each show an array of<br>
12 inch solar panels 12' and 12" mounted between the electronically<br>
operable parking meters 4 and 6 and wherein the electronic<br>
controller 14 is mounted on a 2 foot high parking meter stand 2'<br>
and supports the solar panel array 12' as shown in Figure 3B, or as<br>
shown in Figure 3C, the solar panel array 12" is mounted directly<br>
on top of the parking meter stand 2" with the electronic controller<br>
14 mounted within the parking meter stand 2".<br>
The placement of the solar panel array 12 as shown in Figs 1A<br>
and 2 is best where there may be insufficient direct sunlight to<br>
activate the solar array, such as for example where the parking<br>
meter system is located on an urban street shielded by tall<br>
buildings. However, where the electronically operable parking<br>
meters are located where there is sufficient direct sunlight, su6h<br>
as for example in open parking spaces, then the solar panel arrays<br>
may preferably be mounted to the parking meter stand as illustrated<br>
in Figures 3B and 3C.<br>
Each electronically operable parking meter 4 and 6 is<br>
electronically connected to the electronic controller 14 that is<br>
located within the parking meter stand 2. Figure 4 illustrates the<br>
wiring necessary to connect the printed circuit board 3 4 in an<br>
existing meter to the electronic controller 14. There are three<br>
wires which connect the electronic controller 14 to the printed<br>
circuit board 34 via the terminal strip 32. One wire 36 serves as<br>
ground, another wire 38 controls the reset switch (not shown), and<br>
the other wire 40 relates to vehicle detection. All three wires<br>
36, 38 and 40 enter the electronically operable meter 4 or 6<br>
through an opening 42 in the meter battery compartment 43.<br>
The electronically operable parking meter system may contain<br>
a printed circuit board and a cpu within the controller 14 located<br>
in the parking meter stand 2. The cpu may be used to monitor<br>
and/or control operation of the electronically operable parking<br>
meter system of the invention. Figure 5 is a flow diagram which<br>
illustrates communications between an electronically operable<br>
parking meter 4 or 6 and its cpu.<br>
When a vehicle enters a parking space the electronically<br>
operable parking meter 4 or 6 detects its presence. The<br>
electronically operable parking meter then begins timing and<br>
notifies the cpu of the vehicle's presence. If coins are not<br>
deposited into the meter within a predetermined period of time<br>
(perhaps 30-60 seconds) , the electronically operable parking meter<br>
flashes "zero" on its LCD and alerts the cpu as to the vehicle's<br>
presence as well as the time at which the vehicle entered the<br>
parking space. When coins are deposited into the electronically<br>
operable parking meter, the parking meter performs three functions:<br>
(1) it will count the coins, and notify the cpu that coins have<br>
been deposited; (2) it will turn off the flashing "zero" on the<br>
LCD; and (3) it will continuously measure and display the amount of<br>
time remaining on the meter. If there has been delay (more than<br>
30-60 seconds) in depositing coins, the meter will alert the cpu as<br>
to the delay.<br>
When a vehicle leaves the parking space while time remains on<br>
the meter, the meter may wipe off any remaining time and notify the<br>
cpu that the parking space is empty. When a vehicle remains in the<br>
parking space after the time has expired, the meter may flash<br>
"zero" in its LCD and alert the cpu that a vehicle has remained in<br>
the parking space after time has expired.<br>
Multiple induction loop-controlled electronically operable<br>
parking meters may have a single power supply. As stated<br>
previously, the power supply may be solar energy, where a single<br>
solar panel is used to supply energy to multiple meters.<br>
Preferably, the solar panel may be attached to an existing<br>
structure, such as a street lamp, pole or a traffic signal support<br>
post. Alternatively, multiple parking meters could receive their<br>
power from a nearby traffic signal power supply.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates power lines 4 6 running from an existing<br>
traffic signal power supply 48 to multiple dual electronic operable<br>
parking meter systems.<br>
Multiple electronically operable parking meters may be<br>
connected to a single cpu which receives information regarding<br>
revenue collection at each meter and vehicle traffic at each<br>
parking space. The cpu may relay information relating to vehicle<br>
traffic and revenue collection to an information gathering and/or<br>
processing center. Communications between the cpu and the<br>
information processing center may be by a number of means,<br>
including wire, fiber optics and radio waves.<br>
In Figure 7 inductance loop 10, comprising 4 to 5 loops of<br>
conductor, is connected by a twisted conductor pair 12, 14 to a<br>
loop oscillator 16, which in the preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention oscillates at 80 KHz. The function of the loop<br>
oscillator 16 is to detect the presence or absence of a vehicle in<br>
the associated parking space (not shown), in which the inductance<br>
loop 10 is buried below the surface, by detecting a change in he<br>
inductance of the inductance loop. The presence of a vehicle<br>
causes an effective decrease in the inductance and the absence of<br>
a vehicle results in an effective increase in the inductance of the<br>
inductance loop 10. The effective change in the inductance of the<br>
inductance loop 10 causes a commensurate change in the oscillating<br>
frequency of the loop oscillator 16, with decreasing inductance<br>
causing an increase in the frequency and an increasing inductance<br>
causing a decrease in the oscillating frequency of the loop<br>
oscillator.<br>
By effectively sensing the change in frequency caused by, the<br>
aforementioned change in inductance, which in turn represents the<br>
presence or absence of a vehicle in the associated parking place,<br>
the loop oscillator 16 positively identifies the presence or<br>
absence of a vehicle in the parking space. The loop oscillator 16<br>
provides signals to the microprocessor controller 18 that enables<br>
it to positively determine the presence or absence of a vehicle in<br>
the associated parking space. The microprocessor controller 18<br>
generates serial data which is input to the electronic parking<br>
meter 22 through output interface 20 to enable the electronic<br>
parking meter to operate in a desired manner (to be more fully<br>
described hereinafter). The electronic parking meter 22 is capable<br>
of accepting coins enabling time to be purchased in accordance with<br>
the amount of money deposited in the parking meter (as symbolically<br>
illustrated in Figure 6 by the "coin drop") in accordance with<br>
accepted procedures for the same. Finally, the time purchased by<br>
the coin drop in electronic parking meter 22 is displayed by time<br>
display 24.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 8, inductance loop 10 is connected to<br>
oscillator circuit 26 through an isolation transformer 28, which<br>
includes a capacitor 30 for suppression of transients, and a tuning<br>
capacitor 32 connected in parallel with the secondary of isolation<br>
transformer 28 and oscillator circuit 26.<br>
Oscillator circuit 26 is designed to oscillate at a base<br>
frequency of 80 KHz, but has a variable rate of oscillation about<br>
the base frequency in accordance with the presence or absence of a<br>
vehicle in the associated parking space. The oscillatory output of<br>
oscillator circuit 26 is squared by squaring circuit 34 to enable<br>
the oscillating signal to be accepted by microprocessor controller<br>
18. Microprocessor controller 18 includes a 4 MHz crystal<br>
oscillator 3 6 which provides the base operating frequency of the<br>
microprocessor controller as shown in Figure 10.<br>
It is a significant feature of the invention that the<br>
electronically operated parking meter 22 and the oscillator circuit<br>
26 are operated by independent dry cell batteries.<br>
Microprocessor controller 18 provides an ON/OFF duty cycle of<br>
operation of the detector system 16 as illustrated in Figure 9 in<br>
which the detector system 16 is activated for approximately 12.5 ms<br>
and inactive ("sleep time") for 2.5 seconds minus the 12.5 ms<br>
operating time of the detector system. This is an important<br>
feature of the invention, as it significantly reduces the battery<br>
power required for operating the detector system of the invention.<br>
This enables the battery operable up to nine to twelve months,<br>
which considerably reduces the maintenance required of the detector<br>
system.<br>
LED indicator 38 provides an indication of the operation of<br>
the microprocessor controller 18 and reset switch 40 enables the<br>
controller to be reset as desired.<br>
The detection of the presence or absence of a vehicle in the<br>
associated parking space is as follows. The presence or absence of<br>
a vehicle in the associated parking space respectively decreases or<br>
increases the inductance of the associated loop 10 , which in turn<br>
causes a respective increase or decrease in the frequency of<br>
operation of the oscillator circuit 26. The 4 MHz frequency<br>
signals from the microprocessor controller 18 are superimposed with<br>
the frequency of the oscillator circuit 26 as illustrated in Figure<br>
9. Thus a decreasing frequency of the oscillator circuit 26,<br>
resulting in a longer period of oscillation, will produce more 4<br>
MHz signals in a given period of oscillation of the oscillator<br>
circuit 26 than in the normal 80 KHz operation of the oscillator<br>
circuit, thereby enabling the microprocessor controller to<br>
determine the absence of a vehicle in the associated parking space.<br>
Similarly for an increase in the frequency of the oscillator<br>
circuit 26, associated with the presence of a vehicle in the<br>
associated parking space, there is less of a period of oscillation<br>
of the oscillator circuit 26 and a commensurate decrease in the<br>
number of 4 MHz signals to be counted by the microprocessor circuit<br>
18.<br>
The microprocessor circuit 18 also provides serial data output<br>
to the electronic parking meter 22 to enable it to function in a<br>
desired manner (to be described more fully hereinafter).<br>
Therefore, it is desired that the present invention not<br>
be limited to the embodiments specifically described, but that it<br>
include any and all such modifications and variations that would be<br>
obvious to those skilled in this art. It is my intention that the<br>
scope of the present invention should be determined by any and all<br>
