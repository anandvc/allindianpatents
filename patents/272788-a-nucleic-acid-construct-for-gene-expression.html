TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A Nucleic Acid Construct for Gene Expression<br>
APPLICANT<br>
INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY BOMBAY<br>
Preamble of the Description<br>
The following specification particularly describes<br>
the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of biotechnology, in particular to a nucleic acid construct for gene expression. More particularly, the invention is directed to nucleic acid construct for the production of recombinant protein. The present invention allows efficient and economical expression of gene products by means of a bi-directionally active promoter sequence.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Production of biomolecules for therapeutic or industrial uses is usually carried out by incorporating a nucleic acid containing the gene of interest in a living cell, which is called a host. The nucleic acid containing the gene may either be integrated in the host genome, or may be incorporated in an autonomous nucleic acid molecule called episome or plasm id. Depending on the gene product, the host cell may be eukaryotic or prokaryotic. Escherichia coli is the most commonly used host organism due to ease of genetic manipulation, simple growth requirements and fast doubling time.<br>
For expression of the gene of interest, the nucleic acid containing the gene is placed downstream of another nucleic acid sequence that controls expression of the gene of interest. This controlling element is called a promoter. The promoter may be constitutive or inducible. Constitutive promoters allow expression of genes placed downstream to occur at all times, while inducible promoters allow expression of genes placed downstream to occur only under certain conditions. Generally, inducible promoter sequences are preferred so as to allow controlled expression of the nucleic acid of interest.<br>
A number of promoter sequences are known in the prior art. Examples of commonly used promoter sequences in E. coli include the lac promoter and variants thereof, which are inducible by addition of molecules like isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Promoters like   λ  pL and   λ   pR are inducible by a shift in<br>
 <br>
temperature. Induction of expression by means of chemicals or temperature changes is not feasible in large-scale fermentation. Moreover, strong induction of a nucleic acid coding for a protein may lead to formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Additionally, for use of some promoters, like the commonly used T7 or T5 promoters, specific E. coli strains must be used, which may be undesirable in some applications.<br>
The expression of more than one nucleic acid molecule in the same host may be desirable in processes like biotransformation. This is currently achieved by either expressing the nucleic acid molecules of interest (each under the control of a different promoter) from two different episomal molecules, or by means of operably linking the nucleic acid molecules to two promoter sequences resident on the same episomal molecule. In the first situation, the host is burdened with two episomal molecules, which may affect growth rate, while in the second, the two promoters may be induced by the same mechanism, leading to expression at similar levels of both nucleic acid molecules. If the promoters are induced by different mechanisms, cost of induction will be a consideration.<br>
Thus, a need exists for conveniently and efficiently expressing one or more than one nucleic acid molecule in a single host organism. The object of the present invention is to address this need.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, a 754 base pair (bp) DNA sequence from the Escherichia coli genome is used to conveniently, inexpensively and efficiently express nucleic acid molecule(s) of interest operably linked to the said DNA sequence. The nucleic acid sequence of the positive strand of the said 754 bp DNA sequence is given below:<br>
SEQIDNo. 1:<br>

The said DNA sequence contains divergent promoter elements, one on each DNA strand. Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal binding sequence may be operably linked to either end of SEQ ID No. 1 for initiation of protein synthesis. An example of Shine-Dalgarno sequence is AGGAGG. DNA sequence coding for gene of interest can be operably linked to either end of the said DNA, allowing expression therefrom. In an embodiment of the present invention, the said sequence may be used to achieve expression of at least two genes that are operably linked to either ends of the said sequence.<br>
Nucleic acid sequences that are at least 60% similar to SEQ ID No. 1, or which exhibit substantially similar functionality form a further aspect of the present invention. The construct may be contained in an episome, plasmid or a host cell. The host cell may be a bacterium, preferably from the Enterobacteriaceae family, more particularly E. coli.<br>
 <br>
The present invention also relates to a process of producing gene products using the expression system described herein. The present invention further includes gene products obtained by the process described herein,<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the expression system thus constructed may be used to express the gene of interest by transforming into E. coli or related bacterial species and cultivating the host cell under conditions that allow expression of the gene or genes of interest. The gene of interest may encode an RNA nucleic acid molecule that may or may not be translated into a protein. Preferably, the gene of interest encodes a protein.<br>
Recombinant protein production using a promoter that is bidirectionally active is not reported in literature. In the present invention, a region of the E, coli genome is used that contains more than one promoter regions, and ribosomal binding sites are incorporated to facilitate translation of the nucleic acid molecule present downstream. This genetic construct can be used to express either one or more than one nucleic acid molecules that are operably linked to one or either ends of the genetic construct.<br>
Expression of a gene of interest operably linked downstream of SEQ ID No. 1 is maximal at temperatures less than 30°C. In an embodiment of the invention, expression of a gene of interest operably linked downstream of SEQ ID No. 1 can be controlled by cultivating the host cell at temperatures above 30°C.<br>
The present expression system can be used to achieve expression of the gene of interest in any E. coli or related bacterial strain, thus avoiding the constraint of using special or specific host strains.<br>
This invention also includes a process for the production of a gene product such as a protein and like biomolecules which comprises the step of culturing a host cell having a nucleic acid construct under known culture condition for expressing the gene product which may be isolated and purified.<br>

Examples<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
All media components used were supplied by Himedia (Mumbai). Restriction enzymes, Taq polymerase, T4 DNA ligase and other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Fermentas. Oligos for carrying out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained from Sigma. All standard molecular biology protocols used were as<br>
 <br>
detailed by Sambrook J and Russell DW in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (CSHL Press, 2001).<br>
Example 1<br>
The negative strand of the 754 bp curli intergenic region was amplified by PCR from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA using primers SR31 (5'-cgcggatccgcggttgtca ccctggacctgg; BamHl recognition sequence underlined) and SR32 (5'-ccggaattcc gggatgaaaccccgc; EcoRl recognition sequence underlined). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 10 minutes at 95°C; followed by 30 cycles each comprising of denaturation for 2 minutes at 95°C, annealing for 40 seconds at 60°C, and extension for 1 minute at 72°C; extension for 10 minutes at 72°C, and final hold at 4°C. The PCR product was digested with BamHl and EcoRl and cloned into the corresponding sites of plasmid pPROBE-NT (Miller WG, Leveau JHJ, Lindow SE. (2000) Improved gfp and inaZ broad-host-range promoter-probe vectors. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact 13, 1243-1250), which contains a promoterless gfp gene. The Hgated product (named pNT-csgDp) was transformed in calcium chloride-competent E. coli DH5a cells and verified by sequencing (Macrogen Inc., South Korea).<br>

The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 18 hours on an orbital shaker (250 rpm). Absorbance at 600 nm and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence intensity (excitation at 490 nm; emission at 510 nm) were determined for both cultures,<br>
