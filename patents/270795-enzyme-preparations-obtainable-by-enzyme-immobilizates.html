Enzyme preparations<br>
The invention relates to novel enzyme preparations for<br>
use as biocatalysts.<br>
Microorganisms and isolated enzymes find wide use as a<br>
catalyst in the chemical industry or in food<br>
production. An overview is offered, for example, by:<br>
A. Liese, K. Seelbach, C. Wandrey, Industrial<br>
Biotransformations, Wiley-VCH: 2 000, Weinheim, Germany.<br>
In order to ensure economic use of such biocatalysts,<br>
some conditions have to be satisfied: the biocatalyst<br>
has to be active for a sufficiently long time under the<br>
reaction conditions, it should be readily removable<br>
after the end of the reaction and it should be reusable<br>
as often as possible. Ideally, these conditions should<br>
be satisfied for a very wide range of reaction<br>
conditions (for example temperature range, type of<br>
solvents used, pressures, etc), in order to provide as<br>
universal as possible a catalyst.<br>
In order to satisfy these conditions, it is typically<br>
necessary to immobilize the enzymes or microorganisms<br>
containing enzymes used.<br>
Frequently, the enzymes or microorganisms containing<br>
enzymes are immobilized noncovalently on carriers; the<br>
carriers used are frequently ion exchange resins or<br>
polymer particles which possess suitable particle size<br>
distributions. Examples for this purpose are the<br>
commercial products Novozym 435, Lipozym RM IM or<br>
Lipozym TL IM from Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark or<br>
Amano PS, from Amano, Japan. These examples are<br>
immobilized lipases which find wide use, since such<br>
immobilizates also exhibit industrially utilizable<br>
activities in nonaqueous systems, i.e. those which<br><br>
comprise only organic solvents, if any, as described,<br>
for example, in J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Comm. 1989, 934-<br>
935. A disadvantage of the use of such immobilizates<br>
is, however, firstly the desorption of the enzyme or of<br>
the microorganisms containing enzymes which occurs<br>
depending on the reaction system used, for example in<br>
the case of use of surfactant components. The loss of<br>
activity associated with such a desorption is shown in<br>
Comparative Example 1. In addition, such preparations<br>
possess inadequate mechanical stability, as a result of<br>
which use in simple stirred reactors is possible only<br>
with acceptance of significantly restricted<br>
reusability, if at all. The mechanical instability of<br>
such preparations is shown in Comparative Example 2.<br>
In order to enable the repeated use of such enzyme<br>
preparations, other reactor designs therefore have to<br>
be used. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2003, 105, 601-607<br>
describes, for example, the use of a fixed bed reactor<br>
for performing lipase-catalyzed esterifications. A<br>
disadvantage of this process is, however, the<br>
restriction to low-viscosity homogeneous reaction<br>
mixtures, since high-viscosity mixtures or suspensions<br>
cannot be conveyed through a fixed bed.<br>
K. Faber "Biotransformations in Organic Chemistry",<br>
Springer: 2000, Berlin, Germany, describes, on page<br>
3 84 ff., the use of enzymes incorporated into<br>
alginates. However, the preparations thus obtained have<br>
an exceptionally low mechanical stability and exhibit<br>
only low activity in nonaqueous systems.<br>
In addition, the subsequent crosslinking of immobilized<br>
enzymes with reactive substances, for example<br>
glutaraldehyde, is described. However, a disadvantage<br>
is the usually significantly reduced specific activity<br>
of the crosslinked preparations compared to the<br>
activity before the modification. Furthermore, this<br>
process does not make any contribution to improving the<br><br>
Likewise described there is the covalent immobilization<br>
of enzymes on reactive carriers. A disadvantage here is<br>
that suitable functional groups have to be present on<br>
the surface of the enzyme, which can react with the<br>
carrier; in addition, a loss of enzyme activity is<br>
often achieved as the result.<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 9487-9496 describes the<br>
incorporation of enzymes into siloxane matrices, known<br>
as sol-gels. A disadvantage of sol-gel preparations is<br>
the low particle size distribution which complicates<br>
efficient removal by filtration, the lack of mechanical<br>
stability, the occurrence of desorption, the use of<br>
toxic reactants (for the toxicity of TEOS, see, for<br>
example, Nippon Sanso Giho 1990, 9, 68-72 and Archives<br>
of Toxicology 1994, 68, 277-283; for the toxicity of<br>
TMOS, see, for example, Fundamental and Applied<br>
Toxicology 1989, 13, 285-295; for the production of<br>
nontoxic sol-gels, laborious steps are necessary, for<br>
example storage over 6 months or thermal treatment at<br>
350Â°C, as described in Polimery w Medycynie 2000, 30,<br>
45-54, and also the swelling behaviour which is very<br>
highly dependent upon the solvent used and does not<br>
permit universal use in different reaction systems<br>
(aqueous and nonaqueous). J. Sol Gel Sci. Technol.<br>
2003, 26, 1183-1187 shows, by way of example, the<br>
solvent dependence of the enzyme activity observed and<br>
hence the lack of satisfaction of the demand for wide<br>
usability.<br>
Landbauforschung Volkenrode, 2002, special edition 241,<br>
41-46 describes sol-gel preparations in which enzymes<br>
are first immobilized onto "fine" silicone particles<br>
and then encapsulated into a sol-gel. The problem of<br>
mechanical stability is thus solved partially, but the<br>
experiments described show that sufficient activities<br>
are achieved only in selected solvents; use in a<br><br>
solvent-free system is not described at all. In<br>
addition, the preparations are not obtained in a<br>
directly usable form, but rather first have to be cut<br>
to an appropriate size, which is barely implementable<br>
on the industrial scale.<br>
J. Mol. Catal. B, 2005, 35, 93-99 describes the<br>
immobilization of enzymes by incorporation of aqueous<br>
enzyme solutions into mechanically stable silicone<br>
spheres, known as static emulsions. The resulting<br>
specific activities of the preparations are, though, at<br>
up to 33 U/g, much too low compared to the above-<br>
described immobilizates on inert carriers, where<br>
specific activities of more than 1000 U/g can be<br>
achieved easily (U = unit or pmol/min).<br>
WO 03/106607 Al likewise describes such static<br>
emulsions, but exclusively the use in aqueous systems<br>
is described; the application is a washing composition,<br>
i.e. not a biocatalysis, and the resulting particle<br>
sizes, at approx. 10 ^m, are too small for efficient<br>
filtration out of organic reaction mixtures.<br>
There is therefore still a need for methods of enzyme<br>
immobilization which overcome the disadvantages of the<br>
prior art, in order to implement biocatalytic processes<br>
which have not been realizable to date.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide enzyme preparations which do not have one or<br>
more of the disadvantages of the prior art<br>
preparations. In particular, enzyme preparations shall<br>
be provided, which have a high stability with respect<br>
to mechanical forces and with respect to desorption and<br>
at the same time preferably possess specific activities<br>
in different aqueous and nonaqueous reaction mixtures<br>
which are high enough to enable industrial use. In<br>
terms of their particle size distribution, the enzyme<br>
preparations should preferably be capable of being<br><br>
removed from the reaction system in a simple manner and<br>
of being reused.<br>
Further objects which are not specified explicitly are<br>
evident from the context of the description which<br>
follows, the examples and the claims.<br>
It has been found that, surprisingly, this object is<br>
achieved by enzyme preparations which are obtained by<br>
immobilizing enzymes or microorganisms comprising<br>
enzymes on an inert carrier and then coating with a<br>
silicone coating obtained by hydrosilylation.<br>
The present invention therefore provides enzyme<br>
preparations which are obtainable by enzyme<br>
immobilizates which comprise enzymes or microorganisms<br>
containing enzymes immobilized on an inert carrier<br>
being provided with a silicone coating obtained by<br>
hydrosilylation, and their use as an industrial<br>
biocatalyst.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for<br>
preparing the inventive enzyme preparations, which is<br>
characterized in that enzyme immobilizates which<br>
comprise enzymes or microorganisms comprising enzymes<br>
immobilized on an inert carrier are provided with a<br>
silicone coating obtained by hydrosilylation.<br>
The inventive enzyme preparations have the advantage<br>
that they have a high stability with respect to<br>
mechanical forces and with respect to desorption. In<br>
spite of these improved properties, the inventive<br>
enzyme preparations have specific activities in various<br>
aqueous reaction mixtures (for example in the<br>
hydrolysis of tributyrin) and nonaqueous reaction<br>
mixtures (for example in the solvent-free synthesis of<br>
propyl laurate), which are high enough to enable<br>
industrial use. The inventive enzyme preparations also<br>
have the advantage that the selection of the carrier<br><br>
material and of the associated particle size<br>
distribution allows the particle size to be adjusted<br>
such that simple removal of the enzyme preparations<br>
from the reaction system and hence also the reuse of<br>
the enzyme preparations is possible.<br>
The inventive enzyme preparations and a process for<br>
their production are described below by way of example,<br>
without any intention that the invention be restricted<br>
to these illustrative embodiments. When ranges, general<br>
formulae or compound classes are specified below, these<br>
shall not only encompass the corresponding ranges or<br>
groups of compounds which are mentioned explicitly but<br>
also all sub-ranges and sub-groups of compounds which<br>
can be obtained by selecting individual values (ranges)<br>
or compounds. When documents are cited within the<br>
present description, their contents shall be<br>
incorporated completely in the disclosure-content of<br>
the present invention. When compounds, for example<br>
organically modified polysiloxanes which may have<br>
different units more than once are described in the<br>
context of the present invention, they may occur in<br>
these compounds in random distribution (statistical<br>
oligomer) or ordered (block oligomer). Information<br>
regarding the number of units in such compounds should<br>
be interpreted as the mean value, averaged over all<br>
appropriate compounds.<br>
The inventive enzyme preparations are notable in that<br>
they are obtainable by providing enzyme immobilizates<br>
which comprise enzymes or microorganisms comprising<br>
enzymes immobilized on an inert carrier with a silicone<br>
coating, which is obtained by hydrosilylation.<br>
To produce the enzyme immobilizates, it is possible to<br>
use whole cells, resting cells, purified enzymes or<br>
cell extracts which comprise the corresponding enzymes,<br>
or mixtures thereof. Preference is given to using<br>
hydrolytic enzymes, for example lipases, esterases or<br><br>
proteases, for example lipases from Candida rugosa,<br>
Candida antarctica, Pseudomonas sp., Thermomyces<br>
langosiosus, porcine pancreas, Mucor miehei,<br>
Alcaligines sp., cholesterol esterase from Candida<br>
rugosa, esterase from the porcine liver, more<br>
preferably lipases. Accordingly, the enzyme<br>
immobilizates preferably comprise enzymes from the<br>
class of the hydrolases, preferably lipases.<br>
The inert carriers used may be inert organic or<br>
inorganic carriers. The inert carriers used, or present<br>
in the enzyme immobilizate, are preferably those<br>
particulate carriers which have a particle size<br>
distribution in which at least 90% of the particles<br>
have a particle size of 10 to 5000 [jm, preferably of<br>
50 |im to 2000 Jim. The organic carriers used may<br>
especially be those which comprise or consist of<br>
polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, polyvinylstyrene,<br>
styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, PTFE and/or<br>
other polymers. The carrier materials used may,<br>
depending on the enzyme to be immobilized, especially<br>
be acidic or basic ion exchange resins, for example<br>
Duolite A568, Duolite XAD 761, Duolite XAD 1180,<br>
Duolite XAD 7HP, Amberlite IR 120, Amberlite IR 400,<br>
Amberlite CG 50, Amberlyst 15 (all products from Rohm<br>
and Haas) or Lewatit CNP 105 and Lewatit VP OC 1600<br>
(products from Lanxess, Leverkusen, Germany). The<br>
inorganic carriers used may be oxidic and/or ceramic<br>
carriers known from the prior art. In particular, the<br>
inorganic carriers used may, for example, be Celite,<br>
zeolites, silica, controlled-pore glass (CPG) or other<br>
carriers, as described, for example, in L. Cao,<br>
"Carrier-bound Immobilized Enzymes: Principles,<br>
Application and Design", Wiley-VCH: 2005, Weinheim,<br>
Germany. More preferably, the inert carriers present in<br>
the enzyme immobilizate or the inert carriers used to<br>
produce the enzyme immobilizates consist of<br>
polyvinylstyrene, polymethacrylate or polyacrylate.<br><br>
The immobilization on the particles can, in accordance<br>
with the invention, be effected covalently or<br>
noncovalently, preferably noncovalently. For<br>
noncovalent immobilization, the carrier can be<br>
incubated or impregnated, for example, with an aqueous<br>
enzyme solution which may optionally comprise further<br>
constituents, for example inorganic salts or<br>
detergents. This incubation/impregnation can be carried<br>
out, for example, at temperatures between 0Â°C and 50Â°C,<br>
preferably between 0Â°C and 40Â°C. Preference is given to<br>
effecting the incubation/impregnation over a period of<br>
a few minutes to a few hours. The progress of the<br>
incubation can be followed by determining the<br>
concentration of the enzyme in the solution with the<br>
common methods for protein determination. On attainment<br>
of the desired degree of immobilization, the carrier<br>
can preferably be washed with water and, if desired,<br>
dried. An enzyme immobilizate obtained in this way can<br>
subsequently be provided with a silicone coating in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
According to the invention, it is, however,	also<br>
possible to use enzyme immobilizates which	are<br>
commercially available, for example Novozym	435,<br>
Lipozym RM IM or Lipozym TL IM from Novozymes	A/S,<br>
Bagsvaerd, Denmark, or Amano PS from Amano, Japan.<br>
According to the invention, the silicone coating is<br>
obtained by hydrosilylation. To this end, preferably<br>
Si-H-functional polysiloxanes are reacted in the<br>
presence of catalysts, preferably of transition metal<br>
catalysts, with organically modified polysiloxanes<br>
which possess at least one terminal carbon-carbon<br>

double bonds.<br>

the compounds are or may be present in the form of a<br>
mixture with a distribution controlled essentially by<br>

and d are therefore typically mean values.<br>

i.e. the polysiloxanes containing a terminal carbon-<br>
carbon double bond, are preferably polysiloxanes of the<br>
general formula II:<br><br>

600,<br>
m = 1 to 800, preferably 2 to 600,<br>

the compounds of the formula II are or may be present<br>
in the form of a mixture with a distribution controlled<br>
essentially by statistical laws. The values of the<br>
indices m, n, o and p are therefore typically mean<br>

The hydrosilylation can be carried out by established<br>
methods in the presence of a catalyst. It is possible,<br>
for example, to use catalysts which are typically used<br>
for hydrosilylations, for example platinum, rhodium,<br>
osmium, ruthenium, palladium, iridium complexes or<br>
similar compounds or the corresponding pure elements or<br>
their derivatives immobilized on silica, alumina or<br>
activated carbon or similar carrier materials.<br>
Preference is given to performing the hydrosilylation<br>
in the presence of Pt catalysts such as cisplatin or<br>
Karstedt catalyst [tris(divinyltetramethyldisiloxane)-<br>
bis-platinum].<br>
The amount of catalyst used is preferably 10~7 to<br>
10-1 mol per mole of olefin or per mole of terminal<br>
carbon-carbon double bond, preferably 1 to 100 ppm. The<br>
hydrosilylation is carried out preferably at<br>
temperatures of 0 to 200Â°C, preferably of 20 to 120Â°C.<br><br>
The hydrosilylation can be carried out in the presence<br>
or absence of solvent. Generally, solvents are not<br>
needed for the performance of the reaction. The<br>
reaction can, however, be carried out in suitable<br>
solvents, for example aliphatic or aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, cyclic oligosiloxanes, alcohols or<br>
esters. Suitable solvents are especially cyclohexane or<br>
toluene.<br>
According to the invention, based on the mass of the<br>
carrier used, preferably 1 to 500% by mass, more<br>
preferably 10 to 200% by mass, especially preferably 20<br>
to 150% by mass, of siloxane components are used. The<br>
siloxane components are composed especially of the sum<br>
total of the compounds of the formula I and II and of<br>
their reaction products.<br>
The hydrosilylation can be carried out using a wide<br>
variety of different ratios of the compounds of the<br>
formulae I to compounds of the formulae II. Preference<br>
is given to effecting the hydrosilylation at a molar<br>
ratio based on the reactive groups of 1:10 to 10:1,<br>
more preferably of 1:5 to 5:1, especially preferably of<br>
1:1.1 to 1.1:1 and most preferably of 1:1. Selection of<br>
the compounds of the general formula I and II used and<br>
variation in their mixing ratios allows the properties<br>
of the silicone coating to be tailored in relation to<br>
perviousness for substrates and other reaction<br>
properties. Selection of the weight ratio of silicone<br>
components to enzyme immobilizates allows the layer<br>
thicknesses of the silicone coating to be varied and to<br>
be adjusted to appropriate requirements.<br>
The inventive silicone coating, produced by<br>
hydrosilylation, can be obtained by carrying out the<br>
hydrosilylation in the presence of the enzyme<br>
immobilizates. However, it is also possible to obtain<br>
the coatings by applying a siloxane obtained by<br>
hydrosilylation subsequently to the enzyme<br><br>
immobilizates. This can be effected, for example, by<br>
treating the enzyme immobilizates with a solution of<br>
the siloxane, for example a solution of the siloxane in<br>
an organic solvent, especially cyclohexane or toluene.<br>
Subsequently, the solvent can be removed, for example,<br>
by evaporation. The concentration of siloxane in such a<br>
solution is preferably 10 to 100% by mass, more<br>
preferably 30 to 100% by mass. However, preference is<br>
given to obtaining the inventive silicone coating by<br>
carrying out the hydrosilylation in the presence of the<br>
enzyme immobilizates.<br>
The inventive enzyme preparations are preferably<br>
prepared by the process according to the invention<br>
described below. This process for preparing enzyme<br>
preparations is notable in that enzyme immobilizates<br>
which comprise enzymes or microorganisms comprising<br>
enzymes immobilized on an inert carrier are provided<br>
with a silicone coating obtained by hydrosilylation.<br>
Preference is given to performing the process according<br>
to the invention in such a way that the enzyme<br>
immobilizates are provided with a silicone coating by<br>
contacting the enzyme immobilizates with a reaction<br>
mixture which comprises SiH-functional polysiloxanes,<br>
polysiloxanes containing terminal carbon-carbon double<br>
bonds and a catalyst which catalyzes the<br>
hydrosilylation under hydrosilylation conditions. In<br>
particular, the process can be performed in such a way<br>
that a hydrosilylation reaction is carried out in the<br>
presence of enzyme immobilizates which comprise enzymes<br>
or microorganisms comprising enzymes immobilized on an<br>
inert carrier. The silicone formed in the<br>
hydrosilylation allows the enzyme immobilizate to be<br>
provided with a silicone coating.<br>
The hydrosilylation can be carried out in a manner<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Preference is given<br>
to performing the hydrosilylation using the<br><br>
abovementioned parameters/feedstocks/catalysts.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to<br>
the invention, a particular amount of enzyme<br>
immobilizate is admixed with a mixture (reaction<br>
mixture) of the silicone reagents (compounds of the<br>
formulae I and II plus catalyst), for example by adding<br>
a mixture comprising compounds of the general formula I<br>
and of the general formula II and Karstedt catalyst.<br>
For example, it is possible to add to 1 g of an enzyme<br>
immobilizate a mixture of compounds of the formula I<br>
and II in a molar mixing ratio of 10:1 to 1:10, and<br>
also Karstedt catalyst, for example 50 ppm based on the<br>
amount of silicone components present. For the purpose<br>
of optimizing the coating properties, it may be<br>
advantageous to dissolve the silicone components<br>
including the catalyst, before the addition, in a<br>
solvent, for example cyclohexane, toluene or another<br>
organic solvent, and then to add the solution to the<br>
enzyme immobilizate. When, for example, cyclohexane is<br>
used as the solvent, it has been found to be<br>
advantageous, after addition of the solution to the<br>
enzyme immobilizates, to strongly disperse this mixture<br>
for approx. 15 to 3 0 min, for example by means of a<br>
vortexer (Ika, level 9), until the bulk of the<br>
cyclohexane has evaporated off. Subsequently, the<br>
resulting enzyme preparations are dried, i.e. hardened,<br>
in a drying cabinet at 50Â°C, for example for 12 hours.<br>
Altering the mixing ratios of the compounds of the<br>
general formula I and II allows the properties of the<br>
silicone coating to be varied without any problem and<br>
adjusted to appropriate requirements.<br>
A further embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention differs from the above embodiment in that the<br>
enzyme immobilizates to be coated are immersed into the<br>
desired reaction mixture, then removed from the<br>
reaction mixture and dried. The removal can be<br>
effected, for example, using a screen which retains the<br><br>
enzyme immobilizate particles. The immersion time is<br>
preferably 1 to 10 minutes. The drying can be effected<br>
in a conventional drying cabinet. Preference is given<br>
to effecting the drying/hardening at a temperature of<br>
20Â°C to 80Â°C, preferably at 40Â°C to 60Â°C, more<br>
preferably at approx. 50Â°C.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, which is suitable especially for performance<br>
on the industrial scale, the hydrosilylation is carried<br>
out using a pelletizing pan unit (for example from<br>
Erweka or Eirich) . In this case, a defined amount of<br>
enzyme immobilizate particles is introduced into the<br>
so-called pan unit and stirred. Subsequently, either<br>
the mixture comprising compounds of the formulae I and<br>
II, and also catalyst and also if appropriate solvent,<br>
is added or else, preferably, using a two-substance<br>
nozzle (for example from Schlick or others), in which<br>
the mixture or the components is/are applied under<br>
pressure (for example nitrogen or synthetic air) in the<br>
form of a fine droplet mist, in order to ensure a very<br>
homogeneous distribution on the particles. After a<br>
prolonged coating time, the particles are removed as<br>
described above and dried, i.e. hardened, for a few<br>
hours at a temperature of 2 0Â°C to 80Â°C, preferably of<br>
40Â°C to 60Â°C, more preferably of 50Â°C, in a drying<br>
cabinet, and can then be stored at room temperature<br>
until further use.<br>
In a further embodiment, the particles can be generated<br>
in a fluidized bed reactor (for example from Erweka),<br>
in which particles and the reaction mixture are applied<br>
with high dispersion in appropriate mixing ratios.<br>
The inventive enzyme preparations can be used, for<br>
example, as biocatalysts, especially as industrial<br>
biocatalysts.<br>
The present invention is illustrated in detail with<br><br>
reference to Figures 1 and 2, without being restricted<br>
thereto.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show images of stirred suspensions in a<br>
100 ml beaker with a diameter of the base of 4 cm. The<br>
suspensions have been produced as described in<br>
Example 2. Figure 1 shows that the stirred suspension<br>
based on untreated NZ435 is cloudy as a result of fine<br>
particles. The stirred suspension based on NZ435<br>
treated in accordance with the invention, in contrast,<br>
is clear, i.e. comprises no particles or at least no<br>
particles in a visible size (Fig. 2).<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate<br>
the present invention in detail, without restricting<br>
the scope of protection which is evident from the<br>
description and the claims.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Materials and methods:<br>
Novozym 435 (NZ435) is a commercial enzyme immobilizate<br>
from Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark, a lipase B from<br>
C. antarctica immobilized on a polymethacrylate by<br>
adsorption.<br>
Hydrolytic activity (tributyrin hydrolysis in aqueous<br>
medium):<br>
The hydrolytic activity was determined by the so-called<br>
pH-stat method. In this method, the acid released in<br>
the hydrolysis is titrated against a base, such that<br>
the pH of the solution is kept constant. The time<br>
dependence of the consumption of base allows the acid<br>
released, and hence the enzyme activity, to be<br>
quantified. Illustrative procedure: 10-20 mg of<br>
catalytically active particles were added to 25 ml of<br>
Tris-HCl buffer (1 mM, pH 7.5; additionally contains<br>
0.1 mM NaCl and CaCl2) and 500 jil of tributyrin were<br>
added. The hydrolytic activity was quantified on an<br>
autotitrator (Tritroline alpha, from Schott) via the<br>
amount of base titrated in (50 mM NaOH).<br>
Hydrolytic activity (ethyl valerate in aqueous medium):<br>
Analogously to the determination of the hydrolysis<br>
activity using the example of tributyrin, ethyl<br>
valerate can also be used. Illustrative procedure:<br>
10-20 mg of catalytically active particles were added<br>
to 25 ml of phosphate buffer (1 mM, pH 8.0) and 500 ul<br>
of ethyl valerate. The hydrolytic activity was<br>
quantified on an autotitrator (Tritroline alpha, from<br>
Schott) via the amount of base titrated in (10 mM<br>
NaOH).<br>
Synthesis activity in PLU units (propyl laurate<br>
synthesis activity in solvent-free system):<br>
10 mg of catalytically active particles were added to<br>
5 ml of equimolar substrate solution (lauric acid and<br><br>
1-propanol) and incubated while shaking and/or stirring<br>
at 60Â°C. Samples (Vsampie: 50 (0,1) were taken every 5 min<br>
over 25 min and transferred into 950 (0,1 of decane<br>
(internal standard: 4 mM dodecane). The PLUs were<br>
determined with reference to the initial product<br>
formation rates. Propyl laurate was detected by gas<br>
chromatography (retention time: 9.791 min) (Shimadzu<br>
2010, BTX column from SGE; length 25 m, I.D. 0.22 (am;<br>
film: 0.25 (0m; detector type: FID at 300Â°C; injector<br>
temperature 275Â°C and injection volume 1 ï­1, split<br>
ratio 35.0; carrier gas pressure (helium) 150 kPa;<br>
temperature programme: start temperature 60Â°C, hold for<br>
1.5 min, temperature rise 20Â°C/min, end temperature<br>
250Â°C, hold for 2.5 min).<br>
Determination of laccase activity:<br>
To determine laccase activity, catalytically active<br>
particles (native or immobilized laccase) are<br>
transferred into 19 ml of potassium phosphate buffer<br>
(100 mM, pH 6, 37Â°C) with 1 ml of ABTS solution (ready-<br>
to-use solution, 1.8 mM, available from Sigma-Aldrich)<br>
and the increased extinction is measured photospectro-<br>
metrically at 405 nm. Laccase activity shall be<br>
monitored over a period of 2 0 min. The samples are<br>
taken at intervals of 5 min.<br>
The activity can be determined as follows:<br>
activity<br>
A Ext.	405 change in extinction as a function of time<br>
Vtotai total volume of reaction batch [20 ml]<br>
Vsample	volume of sample [2 ml]<br>
At change in time [min]<br>
e extinction coefficient for ABTS at 405 nm<br>
[43.2 ml ï­mol-1 cm-1]<br>
d	path length of cell [1 cm]<br>
The activity is reported in units (U/ml or U/g) defined<br><br>
as 1 ï­mol of substrate conversion per minute.<br>
Protein determination according to Bradford:<br>
The determination of the protein content in the<br>
supernatant was carried out according to the method of<br>
Bradford (Anal. Chem. 1976, 72, 248-254), which is<br>
based on the binding of the triarylme thane dye<br>
Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to basic and aromatic<br>
amino acid residues in the protein. This binding causes<br>
a shift in the absorption maximum from 465 nm to 595<br>
nm. To establish the calibration, the absorbances of<br>
BSA were determined in the concentrations of 5-20 ï­g/l.<br>
To this end, the particular samples were made up to<br>
800 ï­l with H2O, and 200 ï­l of Bradford reagent (Bio<br>
Rad, Munich) were added, and the samples were measured<br>
at 595 nm.<br>
To determine the leaching behaviour of the<br>
catalytically active particles under harsh reaction<br>
conditions, the procedure was extended by the following<br>
steps:<br>
The protein content of Novozym 435 (NZ4356) was<br>
determined by the following scheme. The NZ43 5 particles<br>
were incubated with shaking at 45Â°C in acetonitrile/H20<br>
(1:1, v/v) for 3 0 min, and then samples (for example<br>
1 ml) were taken from the supernant, lyophilized and<br>
resuspended in H2O (likewise 1 ml). Subsequently, the<br>
protein content was determined as described above. The<br>
results can be taken from Table 1.<br><br><br>
Comparative Example 1: Determination of the mechanical<br>
stability of conventional enzyme immobilizates<br>
For the purpose of determining the mechanical<br>
stabilities of the particles, they were incubated in<br>
various high-viscosity equimolar substrate solutions<br>
(for example polyethylene glycol (molar mass approx.<br>
2400) and oleic acid) with high power inputs and at<br>
temperatures of &gt; 60Â°C, and then the integrity of the<br>
particles was studied. Using NZ435 (5% by weight in<br>
polyethylene glycol (molar mass approx. 2400) and oleic<br>
acid), the formation of fine particles could be<br>
detected with the naked eye after 24 hours, for example<br>
by virtue of clear occurrence of turbidity.<br>
Comparative Example 2: Determination of the desorption<br>
stability of conventional enzyme immobilizates<br>
For the purpose of determining the desorption stability<br>
of the particles under harsh reaction conditions,<br>
fractions of 50 mg of NZ43 5 were shaken in 2 0 ml of<br>
MeCN/H2O (1:1, v/v) solution at 45Â°C for 30 min.<br>
Defined samples (for example 1 ml) were taken from the<br>
supernatant and the protein content in the supernatant<br>
was determined as described above. The particles were<br>
recovered by means of a fluted filter and washed with<br>
100 ml of H2O, and dried at 50Â°C for 12 h, in order<br>
then to determine the hydrolytic activity and the<br><br>
synthesis activity in PLU according to the scheme<br>
described above. The results can be taken from Table 2.<br><br>
Example 1: Production of a stable enzyme preparation<br>
Illustrative preparation:<br>
I	g of NZ435 particles were admixed in a metal dish<br>
with 1 ml of reaction mixture, consisting of various<br>
compositions of compounds of the general formulae I and<br>
II	(for composition see Table 3; the components of the<br>
general formulae I and II were prepared by processes<br>
familiar to those skilled in the art, as described, for<br>
example, in US 7,196,153 B2, by equilibration), and<br>
Karstedt catalyst (Syloff 4000, product from Dow<br>
Corning, USA) . The silicone components including the<br>
catalyst were in each case dissolved in 3 ml of<br>
cyclohexane before the application and then added to<br>
the particles in the metal dish. The addition was<br>
followed immediately by strong dispersion by means of a<br>
vortexer (Ika, level 9) for 15-30 min until the bulk of<br>
the cyclohexane had evaporated off. Subsequently, the<br>
particles were dried at 50Â°C in a drying cabinet for<br>
about 12 h.<br><br><br><br>
The particles produced by this process, compared to the<br>
untreated immobilizate, have activity yields in the<br>
hydrolysis of up to 73% (Examples 1 i and 1 iii,<br>
0.77 U/mg of NZ435 compared to 1.05 U/mg for untreated<br>
NZ435, as described in Comparative Example 1), or 65%<br>
(Example 1 i, 0.68 U/mg of NZ435) . In the synthesis,<br>
activity yields of 94% (Example 1 i) , 84% (Example<br>
1 iii) or 68% (Example 1 ii) were achieved.<br>
Example 2: Determination of the mechanical stability of<br>
inventive enzyme preparations<br>
300 mg of particles (untreated, native NZ435 or NZ435<br>
treated according to iii in Table 3) were each stirred<br>
vigorously at 60Â°C in 5 ml of lauric acid for 90 min<br>
(magnetic stirrer plate from Ika, RT Power model, level<br>
5, stirrer bar: length 3.1 cm, width 0.6 cm). After the<br>
stirrer had been removed, photographs of the stirred<br>
suspensions were taken (Figs. 1 and 2).<br>
Figure 1 shows clearly that the stirred suspension<br>
based on untreated NZ435 is cloudy as a result of fine<br>
particles. The stirred suspension based on NZ435<br>
treated in accordance with the invention, in contrast,<br>
is clear, i.e. comprises no particles or at least no<br>
particles in a visible size (Fig. 2).<br>
Subsequently, the particles were removed from the<br>
suspensions by means of a fluted filter, rinsed with<br>
approx. 10 ml of acetone and dried at 50Â°C for 12 h.<br>
For the purpose of determining the mechanical stability<br>
of the particles, a determination of the particle size<br>
distribution was carried out. The screen fractions used<br>
here had the following exclusion sizes: 800 ï­n, 500 ï­m,<br>
300 ï­m, 150 ï­m and 75 ï­m. By screening, the particle<br>
size distributions before and after stirring were<br>
determined. The results can be taken from Table 4.<br><br><br>
Example 3: Determination of the desorption stability of<br>
stable enzyme preparations<br>
Analogously to Comparative Example 2, the particles<br>
obtained from Example 1 were treated with<br>
water/acetonitrile and then the hydrolysis activity,<br>
the synthesis activity and the amount of protein<br>
released were determined. The result of this<br>
determination can be taken from Table 5.<br><br><br>
While untreated native enzyme immobilizate after<br>
incubation exhibits no hydrolysis activity whatsoever<br>
and 56 ï­g/mg of immobilizate were detectable as free<br>
protein, the silicone-coated particles exhibit<br>
hydrolysis activities of up to 75% of the starting<br>
activity (sample ii, 0.51 U/mg of NZ435 vs. 0.77 U/mg<br>
of NZ435 before leaching), synthesis activities of up<br>
to 55% of the starting activity (sample ii, 2980 U/g of<br>
NZ435 vs. 5400 U/g of NZ435 before leaching), and an<br>
enzyme desorption reduced by up to 86% (sample ii).<br>
Example 4: Production of an enzyme immobilizate<br>
1 g of Lewatit VPOC1600 (from Lanxess) was stirred at<br>
room temperature in 5 ml of CALB solution (Lipozym<br>
CALB L, Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark, hydrolytic<br>
activity: 2700 U/ml) for approx. 18 h, removed by means<br>
of a fluted filter and rinsed with 250 ml of distilled<br><br>
water, then dried under air for 3 h, rinsed with 1 ml<br>
of isopropanol and dried under air once more for 1 h.<br>
The immobilizates thus produced were stored in closable<br>
reaction vessels at 4Â°C until further use.<br>
The activities of the enzyme immobilizates were<br>
measured by processes described above (hydrolytic<br>
activity of 1.04 U/mg and a synthesis activity of<br>
6000 PLU/g). The loading density was determined by<br>
means of a Bradford test to be about<br>
3 0 ï­gprotein/mgvPOC1600 â¢<br>
The enzyme immobilizates thus generated were coated<br>
with silicone in a second step by the process described<br>
above (composition as in test i in Tab. 3). The<br>
proportion by mass of enzyme immobilizate in the<br>
preparation corresponds to 63%. The hydrolytic activity<br>
of the coated preparations is 0.43 U/mg and the<br>
synthesis activity 2927 PLU/g.<br>
Analogously to Comparative Example 2, the uncoated<br>
particles and the silicone-coated particles were<br>
treated with water/acetonitrile and then the hydrolysis<br>
activity, the synthesis activity and the amount of<br>
protein released were determined. The result can be<br>
taken from Table 6.<br><br><br><br>
As can be discerned from Table 6, nine times the amount<br>
of protein is desorbed in the case of the untreated<br>
immobilizate. At the same time, activity yields of 54%<br>
(hydrolysis activity) and 60% (synthesis activity) can<br>
be achieved. The suitability of the above-described<br>
method for coating enzyme immobilizates with silicones,<br>
which has already been shown for commercial finished<br>
preparations using NZ435, has accordingly also been<br>
demonstrated for self-loaded enzyme immobilizates.<br>
Example 5: Determination of enzyme activities in<br>
organic solvent<br>
The activity of the enzyme preparations of Examples 1<br>
and 4, and also of the corresponding native<br>
immobilizates is determined by performing a propyl<br>
laurate synthesis in methylcyclohexane (starting<br>
concentration of substrates = 10 mM, T = 25Â°C).<br><br><br>
It is clear from Table 7	that the activity yield of the<br>
enzyme preparations on	use in organic solvent is<br>
excellent and that the	desorption stability likewise<br>
becomes clear.<br>
Example 6: Production of further lipase preparations<br>
Analogously to Example 1 Lipozym RM IM (lipase from<br>
M. miehei, immobilized on Duolite A568 from Lanxess,<br><br>
available from Novozymes A/S) is provided with a<br>
siloxam coating and the activity yield is determined<br>
analogously to Example 5 in organic solvent.<br><br>
It is clear from Table 8 that, based on the amount of<br>
Lipozym RM IM used, a quantitative activity yield is<br>
achieved within the margin of error.<br>
Example 7: Production of further lipase preparations<br>
Analogously to Example 4, a lipase from T. lanuginosa<br>
(available as Esterase TL01 from Asa Spezialenzyme,<br>
comprising a lipase with additional esterase function)<br>
is immobilized on Lewatit VPOC1600 and provided with a<br>
siloxane coating. Activity is determined by determining<br>
the ethyl valerate hydrolysis.<br><br><br>
Table 9 shows that the native preparation has an<br>
activity of 261 U/g, while the coated preparation has<br>
an activity of 157 U/g. Based on the content of native<br>
immobilizate, this represents an activity of 285 U/g;<br>
that is, a quantitative activity yield can be achieved<br>
within the margin of error.<br>
Example 8: Production of an esterase preparation<br>
Analogously to Example 7, an esterase from R. oryzeae<br>
is immobilized on Lewatit VPOC1600, coated and its<br>
activity determined in the hydrolysis of ethyl<br>
valerate.<br><br><br>
Again, activity yield is quantitative within the margin<br>
of error.<br>
Example 9: Production of a laccase preparation<br>
Analogously to Example 4, a laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) from<br>
Myceliophthora Thermophilia (available as Flavorstar<br>
from Novozymes A/S) was immobilized on Lewatit VP OC<br>
1600 (4.5 mg of protein on 1 g of Lewatit VPOC 1600),<br>
provided with a siloxane coating and tested for<br>
activity in ABTS assay.<br><br><br><br><br>
