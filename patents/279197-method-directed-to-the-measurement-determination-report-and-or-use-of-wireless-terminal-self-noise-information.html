				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING, COMMUNICATING, AND/OR USING INFORMATION RELATING TO SELF-NOISE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to methods and apparatus of wireless signaling and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for generating, transmitting, and/or using a report relating to and/or providing self noise information. <br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]      In cellular wireless systems, base stations often need to communicate user data/information to multiple wireless terminals simultaneously. In the downlink, the link from the base station (BS) to the wireless terminals (WTs), an important problem is the allocation of base station transmitter power to the different WTs being served simultaneously by the same BS. Each BS typically has a total transmit power budget available for all downlink communication, and this power is typically shared amongst the WTs. The base station transmitter power allocated to a WT in the cell will influence the WT's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which in turn affects the downlink data rate that the wireless communications link from the base station to the WT can support. In this way, the power allocation can be used to adjust the downlink data rate to different WTs depending on their traffic needs and channel conditions.<br>
[0003]     One wireless system where this power allocation problem arises is a multiple user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communications system supporting concurrent transmission of different downlink user data to different wireless terminals sourced from the same base station transmitter.<br>
[0004]     One problem in realizing the potential of the multiple access OFDM downlink, is that a base station needs to perform appropriate power allocation. For any assigned data rate option of a downlink traffic segment, the BS needs to correctly allocate enough transmitter power.for that segment to be received reliably at the intended WT. If too little power is allocated, the decoding of the segment will likely<br>
<br>
fail and need re-transmission. If the power allocated for is excessive, it means that power was wasted and that wasted power could have been used for the other WTs being serviced by the base station.<br>
[0005]     Ideally, each data rate option that can be used for downlink traffic communication has a corresponding minimum received SNR requirement, and ideally the received SNR will scale linearly with the received power. Consequentiy, under ideal circumstances, the WT could measure the SNR at a single reference signal level, and then report that SNR back to the BS. Knowing that the SNR scales linearly with the power, assuming an ideal case, for any scheduled data rate option, the base station could adjust the transmit power relative to the reference signal to insure that the segment is received with the correct SNR for that data rate.<br>
[0006]     However, in practice, the WT receiver processing introduces errors, such as channel estimation inaccuracies, phase jitter, and timing and frequency offsets. These errors typically scale with the received power, and effectively add a signal-dependent component to the noise. This noise component is sometimes called "self-noise," to distinguish it from external and thermal noise that is independent of the signal processing. In the presence of self-noise, the received SNR no longer scales linearly with the received power. In particular, as the received power is increased, the SNR eventually saturates at a maximum level depending on the self-noise.<br>
[0007]'     In the presence of self-noise, the WT can no longer simply report the SNR at a single power level and expect the base station to be able to determine correct transmit power corresponding to different data rate options. From a single SNR measurement, the BS cannot separate the self-noise and external noise components, and therefore, cannot accurately extrapolate the power required to obtain any other SNR.<br>
[0008]     The problem of self-noise is particularly important in recently developed wireless technologies which offer high downlink data rates. These systems offer rates at high SNRs (often in excess of 20 dB) where the self-noise component can be significant. Also, as these services are to be offered in mobile, fading environments, or in long range applications with significant delay spread, the self-noise component "will<br>
become more pronounced. It is thus important that the BS can properly select its transmit power corresponding to different downlink traffic channel segments to account for self-noise.<br>
[0009] Consequently, there is a need in wireless communications systems for methods and apparatus directed to the measurement, determination, reporting, and/or use of wireless terminal self-noise information.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]     The present invention is directed to methods and apparatus to methods. and apparatus for generating, transmitting, arid/or using a report relating to and/or providing self noise information.<br>
[0011]     One exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with the invention includes determining a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level and transmitting, e.g., using OFDM signaling, the determined signal to noise ratio saturation level to a base station. In various embodiments, a quantized value is transmitted to represent the determined signal to noise saturation level, hi some embodiments the quantized value is transmitted using a dedicated control channel segment allocated to the wireless terminal but it may be transmitted in other ways instead. The dedicated control channel segment may be a segment reserved to convey a signal to noise ratio saturation level report during each iteration of a recurring predetermined uplink timing structure. As another example, the dedicated control channel segment may be a segment reserved for use by the wireless terminal, in which the wireless terminal selects to convey a signal to noise ratio saturation level report or another report, e.g., an uplink traffic channel request report. One particular exemplary signal to noise ratio level saturation level report conveys 4 information bits with the bit pattern being set to one of sixteen patterns, each corresponding to a different quantization level. In some embodiments, but not necessarily all embodiments, the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is a downlink signal to noise ratio that a " wireless terminal would measure on a received signal that was transmitted by a base station at infinite power if the wireless terminal were capable of receiving andprocessing such a signal. In various exemplary embodiments, the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is a function of wireless terminal self-noise. In some exemplary embodiments, determining the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is based on measured channel estimation errors. In the same or other embodiments, determining the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is based on at least one receiver characteristic, e.g!, receiver filter type, amplifier type, analog to digital converter sampling, rate.<br>
[0012]     In some particular exemplary embodiments, determining a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level includes measuring the received power of a tone corresponding to a NULL base station output to thereby determine an interference power (N), measuring the received power of a pilot signal (GPo), determining the signal to noise ratio of the received pilot signal (SNRo), and calculating the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level, e.g., using the equation: downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level = (1/SNR0 - N/CGPo))"1.<br>
[0013]     The present invention is directed to, among other things, a method of operating a first communications device, e.g., a wireless terminal, including a receiver operating in the presence of self-noise. In one embodiment the method includes receiving first and second signals from a second communications device, e.g., a base station, said first and second signals having been transmitted at first and second power levels, said first and second power levels being different; performing a first noise measurement on the first received signal; performing a second noise measurement of the second received signal; and communicating noise measurement information corresponding to the first and second received signals to the second communications device. In some embodiments, the communicated information provides information indicating how a SNR at the receiver varies as a function of the transmit power of the second device. This allows the second communications device to know or determine the self-noise saturation SNR level of the first communications device.<br>
[0014] While various embodiments have been discussed in the summary above, it should be appreciated that not necessarily all embodiments include the same features and some of the features described above are not necessary in some embodiments.<br>
Numerous additional features, embodiments and benefits of the present invention are discussed in the detailed description whichfollows.<br>

[0047]     Figure 4 is a drawing of a flowchart 400 of an exemplary meuiod of operating a wireless terminal inaccordance with the present invention. Operation starts in step 402, where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. In some embodiments, in step 402, the wireless terminal establishes a connection with a base station attachment point and is assigned an identifier associated with dedicated control channel segments in an uplink timing and frequency structure. Operation proceeds from step 402 to step 404.<br>
[0048]     In step 404, the wireless terminal is operated to determine a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level. For example, in some embodiments, the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is a downlink signal to noise ratio that the wireless terminal would measure on a received signal that was transmitted by a base station at infinite power. In some embodiments, the signal to noise ratio saturation level is a function of wireless terminal self-noise. In various embodiments, the step of determining a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is based on measured channel estimation errors. In some embodiments, the step of determining a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is based on at least one receiver characteristic of a receiver module included in the wireless terminal. For example, the at least one<br>
<br>
receiver characteristic is one of: receiver filter type, amplifier type, and analog digital converter sampling rate.<br>
[0049]     Step 404 includes sub-steps 408,410, 412, and 414. In sub-step 408, the wireless terminal is operated to measure the received power of a tone corresponding to a null base station output to thereby determine an interference power N. For example, the tone corresponding to the null base station output, in some embodiments, corresponds to one of a downlink cell null tone segment and a downlink sector null tone segment. In some embodiments, the received power on multiple null tones is considered in determining the interference power N. In sub-step 410, the wireless terminal is operated to measure the received power of a pilot signal, GPo- Operation proceeds from sub-step 410 to sub-step 412. In sub-step 412, the wireless terminal is operated to determine the signal to noise ratio of said received pilot signal, SNRo- Operation proceeds from sub-step 412 to sub-step 414. In sub-step 414, the wireless terminal is operated to calculate the downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level, e.g., using the formula: downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level = (1/SNRo - N/(GPo))"'. Operation proceeds from. step 404 to step 406.<br>
[0050]     In step 406, the wireless terminal is operated to transmit said determined signal to noise ratio saturation level to a base station. The transmission of step 406 may be as a quantized value that is transmitted using OFDM signals using a predetermined uplink transmission unit dedicated for the transmission of downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level information in a predetermined uplink timing structure. In some embodiments, the predetermined uplink transmission unit is a dedicated control channel segment, as part of an uplink dedicated control channel dedicated to the wireless terminal. An exemplary dedicated control channel segment, in some embodiments, includes 21 OFDM tone-symbols, each tone-symbol used for. conveying a modulation symbol value, e.g., a QPSK modulation symbol value.<br>
[0051]     In some embodiments, the transmitting step 406 transmits a report in the form of one of a plurality of predetermined report values. For example, the predetermined report values are 4 bit values, each value corresponding to a different<br>
<br>
quantization level. In one exemplary embodiment, the 4 information bits of the report convey one of 16 different levels ranging from 8.75dBs to 29.75dBs.<br>
[0052]     Operation proceeds from step 406 to step 404 such that the steps of. determining a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level and transmitting the determined signal to noise ratio saturation level are repeated. In some embodiments, the wireless terminal continues repeating steps 404 and step 406 while the wireless terminal continues tobe allocated a set of dedicated control channel segments, e.g., as an active user.<br>
[0053]     In some embodiments, prior to said transmitting step 406, the wireless terminal is operated to determine as to whether said determined downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level is to be transmitted in an uplink transmission segment in which said wireless terminal can select to transmit said downlink signal to noise ratio saturation level or other information. For example, one exemplary embodiment has, within a recurring "uplink dedicated control channel structure, some segments which are predetermined to be used by the wireless terminal to transmit a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation report and some segments which the wireless terminal may select to transmit a downlink signal to noise ratio saturation report from among a plurality of different types of reports which may be communicated in that segment.<br>
[0054]      Figure 5 is a drawing of a flowchart 500 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with the present invention. Operation starts in step 502 where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from step 502 to steps 504, 506, and 508. In step 504, the wireless terminal measures the received power of a downlink null channel (DL.NCH) and determines an interference power (N). For example, the Null channel corresponds to predetermined tone-symbols in an exemplary downlink timing and frequency structure used by the base station serving as the current attachment point for the wireless terminal in which the base station intentionally does not transmit using those tone-symbols; therefore, received power on the NULL channel measured by the wireless terminal receiver represents interference. In step 506, the wireless terminal measures the received power (G*P0) of a downlink pilot channel (DL.PICH). In step 508, the wireless terminal<br>
<br>
measures the signal to noise ratio (SNRo) of the downlink pilot channel (DL.PICH). Operation proceeds from steps 504, 506, and 508 to step 510.<br>
[0055]     In step 510, the wireless terminal calculates the saturation level of the downlink signal to noise ratio as a function of: the interference power, measured received power of the downlink pilot channel, and measured SNR of the downlink pilot channel. For example, saturation level of the DL SNR = 1/ao = (1/SNRo - N/(GP0))"' -Operation proceeds from step 510 to step 512. In step 512, the wireless terminal selects the closet value from a predetermined table of quantized level of saturation level of downlink SNR to represent the calculated saturation level in a dedicated control channel report, and the wireless terminal generates the report. Operation proceeds from step 512 to step 514. In step 514, the wireless terminal transmits the generated report to the base station, said generated report being communicated using a dedicated control channel segment allocated to the wireless terminal, e.g., using a predetermined portion of a predetermined indexed dedicated control channel segment. For example, the exemplary WT maybe in a full-tone format mode of DCCH operation using the repetitive reporting structure and the report may be a four information bit DLSSNR report, e.g., DLSSNR4, of a DCCH segment included as part of one of the indexed DCCH segments in the repetitive reporting structure.<br>
[0056]     An exemplary 4 bit saturation level of downlink self-noise SNR report (DLSSNR4) will now be described. In some embodiments, the WT derives the saturation level of the DL SNR, which is defined to be the DL SNR that the WT receiver would measure on'a received signal if the base station sector (BSS) transmitted the signal at infinite power. The saturation level can be, and in some embodiments is, determined by the self-noise of the WT receiver, which may be caused by factors such as channel estimation errors. The following is an exemplary method to derive the saturation level of the DL SNR.<br>
[0057]   • In the exemplary method, the WT assumes that if the BSS transmits at power P, the DL SNR is equal to SNR(P) = GP/(aoGP + N), where G represent the wireless channel path gain from the BSS to the WT, so GP is the received signal power, P is the transmission power, N represents the received interference power, ao GP<br>
<br>
represents the self-noise, where a higher value of a0 denotes a higher value of self-noise. G is a value between 0 and 1, ao, P, and N are positive values. In this model, by definition, the saturation level of the DL SNR is equal to 1/ao. In some embodiments, the WT measures the received power of a downlink Null channel (DL.NCH) to determine the interference power N, measures the received power (denoted as G*Po) of . the downlink pilot channel and SNR (denoted by SNRo) of the downlink pilot channel; the WT then calculates 1/ao = (1/SNRo - N/(GP0))"[0058]     Once the WT has derived the saturation level of the DL SNR, the WT reports it by using the closest entry to the derived value in a DL self-noise saturation level report table. Table 600 of Figure 6 is such an exemplary table describing the format of DLSSNR4. First column 602 indicates the 16 different possible bit patterns  ' that can be conveyed by the DLSSNR4 report, and second column 604 lists saturation levels of DL SNR that are communicated corresponding to each bit pattern ranging from 8.75dB to 29.75 dBs.<br>
[0059]      Figure 7 is a drawing 7.00 illustrating exemplary dedicated control channel segments in an exemplary frequency/timing structure allocated to a wireless terminal associated with a dedicated control channel logical tone used to convey a report of the saturation level of downlink self-noise SNR. Vertical axis 702 represents uplink logical tones in an exemplary uplink frequency structure being used by a base station sector attachment point. For example, an exemplary uplink tone block corresponding to the attachment point may use 113 contiguous tones and a subset of those, e.g., die 31 tones indexed 81 .. 111 may be used for dedicated control channel segments. In this   ■ example, logical tone 81 has been allocated to a wireless terminal using the base station sector attachment point. Horizontal axis 704 represents DCCH segment index in a repetitive structure of 40 indexed segments (0.. 39). An exemplary DCCH segment, in some embodiments comprises one logical tone for the duration of 21 OFDM symbol transmission time periods corresponding to 21 OFDM tone-symbols.<br>
[0060]     Legend 706 indicates that DCCH segments represented by full shading 708 are used to convey a four bit downlink self-noise saturation level SNR report (DLSSNR4) and additional report(s). For example, the exemplary segment conveys 6<br>
<br>
information bits and 4 of those 6 information bits represent the DLSSNR4 report. Legend 706 indicates that DCCH segments represented by cross-hatch shading 710 are segments in which the WT may select to convey a four bit downlink saturation level of self-noise SNR report (DLSSNR4) and additional report(s). For example for such DCCH segments the WT may select between sending a DLSSNR4 report and a four bit uplink traffic channel request report.<br>
[0061]      In this example of Figure 7, the exemplary WT has been allocated logical uplink tone 81 and transmits DCCH signals using 40 DCCH segments in a repetitive structure. For each set of 40 DCCH segments allocated to the WT, indexed segment 36 is to be used to convey the DLSSNR4 report. For each set of 40 DCCH segments allocated to the WT, indexed segments 1,11, and 21 may be used to convey the DLSSNR4 report at the discretion of the WT.<br>
[0062]     Figure 8 is a drawing of a flowchart 800 of an exemplary method of operating a first communications device in accordance with the present invention, said first communications device operating in the presence- of self-noise. In some embodiments, the first communications device is a wireless terminal such as a mobile node. In some embodiments, the first communications device is a man portable communications device. In various embodiments, the first communications device is a handheld communications device which supports data communications sessions. In some embodiments, the first communications device is a communications device which supports voice communications between the first communications device and a second communications device.<br>
[0063]      The exemplary method starts in step 802 and proceeds to step 804. In step 804, the first communications device receives first and second signals from a second communications device, said first and second signals having been transmitted at first and second power levels, said first and second power levels being different. In some embodiments, the second communications device is abase station. In various embodiments, the step of receiving first and second signals includes receiving said first and second signals over an airlink. In various embodiments, the second signal was transmitted as a NULL signal. In some embodiments, the first signal is a pilot signal.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the first signal corresponds to at least one tone of an OFDM symbol. In various embodiments, the first and second signals each include at least one tone within the same OFDM symbol. For example an exemplary OFDM symbol, in some embodiments, includes 113 tones, and some of the OFDM symbols include one or more non-zero pilot tone symbol and one or more intentional NULL tones. In some embodiments, the first and second signals are signals which are transmitted at predetermined power levels and wherein at least one of said first and second signals are signals which were transmitted at predetermined phase. For example, the first signal is in some embodiments, a pilot signal transmitted at a non-zero predetermined power level with respect to a base station .reference power level and transmitted at a predetermined phase, and the second signal is an intentional NULL signal transmitted at zero power level. In some embodiments, the first signal is transmitted at a first non-power level and the second signal is transmitted at a second non-zero'power level. For example, in some embodiments, the first signal is a first pilot signal transmitted at a first non-zero power level and the second signal is a second pilot signal transmitted at a second non-zero power level. In some embodiments, the first signal is a first pilot signal transmitted at a first non-zero power level and the second signal is a different broadcast signal transmitted at a second non-zero power level, e.g., a beacon signal, an assignment signal, an identification signal, etc. In some embodiments, the first signal is a broadcast signal communicated at a predetermined power level, e.g., a timing and synchronization broadcast signal, and the second signal is an intentional Null signal. In some such embodiments, the broadcast signal and intentional Null signal are communicated each using at least some tones of the same OFDM symbol. Operation proceeds from step 804 to step 806.<br>
[0064]      In step 806, the first communications device performs a first noise measurement on the first received signal, and in step 808, the first communications device performs a second noise measurement on the second received signal. In some embodiments, the first noise measurement is a measured signal to noise ratio of the first received signal. The second measurement may, but need not be in all embodiments, a type of measurement which is the same as or similar to the first measurement. In some embodiments, the second noise measurement is a measured signal to noise ratio of the second received signal. In some embodiments, the first noise measurement provides<br>
<br>
power information about the first received signal, said first received signal having been transmitted at a predetermined non-zero power level and phase and noise having been subsequently introduced into the first signal. In some embodiments, the second noise measurement provides power information of the second received signal, said second received signal having been transmitted at a zero power level and noise having been subsequentiy introduced into the second signal. In some embodiments, operation proceeds from step 808 to step 810, while in other embodiments, operation proceeds from step 808 to step 812.<br>
[0065]     In step 810, the first communications device jointly codes at least two . pieces of noise measurement information for transmission to said second communications device. In some embodiments, the at least two pieces of noise measurement information jointly coded are jointly coded as part of a dedicated control channel report, e.g., a self-noise saturation level report. In some embodiments, the at least two pieces of noise measurement information jointly coded are jointly coded as part of different reports communicated in the same dedicated control channel segment, e.g., a first report communicating a first SNR report associated with a first transmission power level and a second report communicating a second SNR report associated with a second transmission power level, said two pieces of jointly coded noise information providing the second communications device with information to determine a self-noise saturation level value to be associated with the first communications device. Operation proceeds from step 810 to step 812.<br>
10066]     In step 812, the first communications device communicates noise measurement information corresponding to the first and second signals to the second communications device. In various embodiments quantization is used in the communicating of step 812. In some embodiments, the communicated noise measurement information of step 812 includes one of: i) a theoretical signal to noise ratio assuming a signal transmitted by the second communications device was transmitted at an infinite power level and assuming the receiver could process such a signal; and (ii) an adjusted theoretical signal to noise ratio assuming a signal transmitted by the second communications device was transmitted at aninfinite power level and assuming the receiver could process such a signal. In some such embodiments adjusted<br>
<br>
means applying an offset in dBs by a predetermined amount. In some embodiments, the communicated-noise measurement information of step 812 includes at least two of: (i) a theoretical signal to noise ratio of a signal transmitted by the second communications device and received by the first communications device in the event the first communications device did not introduce any self-noise; (ii) a theoretical signal to noise ratio of a signal transmitted at a first predetermined power level relative to the transmission power level of one of the first and second received signal; (iii) a theoretical signal to noise ratio of a signal transmitted at a second predetermined power level relative to the transmission power level of one of the first and second received signal, said second predetermined power level being different from said first predetermined power level; (iv) a measured signal to noise ratio of the first received signal; (v) a measured signal to noise ratio of said second received signal; (vi) a measured power level of the firstreceived signal; (vii) a measured power level of the second received signal; (viii) an adjusted theoretical signal to noise ratio of a signal transmitted by the second communications device and received by the first communications device in the event the first communications device did not introduce any self-noise; (ix) an adjusted theoretical signal to noise ratio of a signal transmitted at a first predetermined power level relative to the transmission power level of one of the first and second received signal; (x) an adjusted theoretical signal to noise ratio of a signal transmitted at a second predetermined power level relative to the transmission power level of one of the first and second received signal, said second predetermined power level being different from said first predetermined power level; (xi) an adjusted measured signal to noise ratio of the first received signal; (xii) an adjusted measured signal to noise ratio of said second received signal; (xiii) an adjusted measured power level associated with the first received signal; and (xiv) an adjusted measured power level associated with the second received signal. In some such embodiments adjusted means applying an offset in dBs by a predetermined amount.<br>
[0068]     In various embodiments, said first and second signals are transmitted on a predetermined basis and noise measurement information is communicated to the second communications device at least once in a beaconslot, said beaconslot being a grouping of a fixed number of OFDM symbol transmission time periods in a recurring timing structure, said fixed number of OFDM symbol transmission time periods being<br>
<br>
at least 901 consecutive OFDM symbol transmission time periods. For example, in some embodiments, said noise measurement information is communicated at least once during each beaconslot for a wireless terminal operating in a full-tone mode of DCCH operation, e.g., at least one downlink self-noise saturation SNR DCCH channel report is communicated per beaconslot in accordance with a predetermined channel structure.<br>
[0069]     In some embodiments, said first and second signals are transmitted on a predetermined basis and noise measurement information is communicated to the second communications device multiple times in a superslot, said superslot being a grouping of a fixed number of OFDM-symbol transmission time periods in a recurring timing structure, said fixed number of OFDM symbol transmission time periods being at least 101 consecutive OFDM symbol transmission time periods. For example, in some embodiments, said first and second signals are non-zero pilot signals transmitted at different power levels and the noise measurement information includes a first quantized SNR value corresponding to measurements of said first signal and a second quantized SNR value corresponding to measurements of said second signal, said noise measurement information is communicated multiple times during each superslot for a wireless terminal operating in a full-tone mode of DCCH operation, e.g., using dedicated control channel reports in accordance with a predetermined channel structure. In some such embodiments, the second communications device, e.g., base station, receiving the dedicated control channel reports conveying the noise measurement information from a wireless terminal uses the received information to determine a downlink self-noise saturation level SNR value which is associated with the wireless terminal.<br>
[0070]      In various embodiments, a downlink self-noise saturation level SNR value associated with a wireless terminal, communicated either directly or indirectly, is used by the base station acting as the wireless terminals physical attachment point in determining downlink traffic channel segment information, e.g., assignment of downlink traffic channel segments to particular wireless terminals, transmission power level to be associated with a particular downlink traffic channel segment at a particular time, and/or data rate option to.be used for a particular downlink traffic channel segment at a particular time.<br>
