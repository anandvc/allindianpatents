This invention relates to compositions of matter which are useful as addition polymerization catalysts, to a method for preparing these catalyst compositions and to a method of using these catalyst compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to improved olefin polymerization catalyst compositions comprising a Group 4 metal complex and a Group 13 amide or silylamide and to an improved method for polymerizing addition polymerizable monomers using the same.<br>
Constrained geometry metal complexes, their preparation, methods of activation, active catalysts formed therefrom including cationic catalysts and methods of use are disclosed in EP-A-416,815; EP-A-514,828; EP-A-520,732; US-A-5.064,802; US-A-5,374,696; USP 5,470,993; US-A-5,055,438, US-A-5,057,475, US-A-5,096,867, US-A-5,064,802, US-A-5,132,380, and US-A-5,453,410. For the teachings contained therein, the aforementioned United States Patents and published European Patent Applications are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference thereto.<br>
Although previously known active catalysts, especially the cationic catalysts disclosed in the foregoing applications and publications, have excellent activity, they are extremely sensitive to catalyst poisons,'such as polar impurities, that may be contained in a polymerization mixture. Because of this fact, catalyst efficiencies and lifetimes have been limited and molecular weights of the resulting polymers have been reduced.<br>
It is previously known in the art to utilize adjuvants such as trialkylboron and trialkylaiuminum compounds to remove catalyst poisons from biscyclopentadienyl containing olefin polymerization catalysts, Disadvantageously however, such adjuvants have proven to be less effective in combating the inhibition of catalytically activated constrained geometry catalysts, and when used in the polymerization of olefin monomers, actually may interfere with the desired catalytic process. The previously disclosed US-A-5,453,410 disclosed the combination of an alumoxane adjuvant with a cationic constrained geometry catalyst composition. However, alumoxanes are rather less soluble than is desired in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents used in common polymerization systems. Additionally, alumoxanes are pyrophoric and are relatively expensive. Thus, it would be desirable to reduce the quantity of alumoxane used in a polymerization process or more desirably still, to eliminate use<br><br>
of alumoxanes entirely. Instead it would be desirable to utilize an adjuvant which is not pyrophoric and is more soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
Finally, components in polymerization processes or their reaction products ultimately become incorporated into the polymer produced by the polymerization process unless a technique for their removal is available. Alumoxanes are relatively high molecular weight polymeric aluminum oxide compounds. Their presence in residual quantities in the polymerization product is generally not considered to be beneficial to polymer properties, and may actually degrade some polymer properties, particularly polymer clarity.<br>
The present investigations have led to certain improved catalyst compositions that are highly active as addition polymerization catalysts, desirably having improved resistance to catalyst poisons, and improved efficiency.<br>
According to the present invention there is now provided a catalyst composition comprising in combination:<br>
a) a metal complex corresponding to the formula: UMXpX'q,<br>
that has been or subsequently is rendered catalytically active by combination with an activating cocatalyst or by use of an activating technique,<br>

q is 0, 1 or 2; and<br>
b) a Group 13 compound according to the formula R12Me(NR^2),<br>
wherein R1 and R2 independently each occurrence is a hydrocarbyl, silyl, halocarbyl, halohydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyl- substituted silyl, halocarbyl- substituted silyl, or halohydrocarbyl- substituted silyl group, said R1 and R2 having from 1 to 30 carbon, silicon, or mixtures of carbon and silicon atoms, and<br>
Me is a Group 13 metal,<br>
the molar ratio of a):b) being from 1:0.1 to 1:100; or the resulting derivative, reaction product or equilibrium mixture resulting from such combination.<br>
Further according to the present invention there is provided a process for polymerization of addition polymerizable monomers or mixtures thereof comprising contacting said monomer or mixture of monomers with a catalyst system comprising the above catalyst composition under addition polymerization conditions. Preferred addition polymerizable monomers include C2.20.000 a-olefins.

All references to the Periodic Table of the Elements herein shall refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements, published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 1989. Also, any reference to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the lUPAC system for numbering groups.<br>

The complexes can be prepared by use of well known synthetic techniques. A preferred process for preparing the metal complexes is disclosed in USSN 8/427,378, filed April 24,1995, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The reactions are conducted in a suitable noninterfering solvent at a temperature from<br>
-100 to 300 °C, preferably from -78 to 100 °C, most preferably from 0 to 50 °C. A reducing agent may be used to cause the metal M, to be reduced from a higher to a lower oxidation state. Examples of suitable reducing agents are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, aluminum and zinc, alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as sodium/mercury amalgam and sodium/potassium alloy, sodium naphthalenide, potassium graphite, lithium alkyls, lithium or potassium alkadienyls, and Grignard reagents.<br>

Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br><br>
Suitable activating cocatalysts useful in combination with component a) are those compounds capable of abstraction of an X substituent therefrom to form an inert, noninterfering counter ion, or that form a zwitterionic or other catalytically active derivative of a). Suitable activating cocatalysts for use herein include perfluorinated tri(aryl)boron compounds, and most especially tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane; nonpolymeric, compatible, noncoordinating, ion forming compounds (including the use of such compounds under oxidizing conditions), especially the use of ammonium-, phosphonium-, oxonium-, carbonium-, silylium- or sulfonium- salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions, and ferrocenium salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions. Suitable activating techniques include the use of bulk electrolysis (explained in more detail hereinafter). A combination of the foregoing activating cocatalysts and techniques may be employed as well. The foregoing activating cocatalysts and activating techniques have been previously taught with respect to different metal complexes in the following references: EP-A-277,003, US-A-5,153,157, US-A-5,064,802, US-A-5,321,106, EP-A-520,732; and US-A-5,350.723, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
More particularly, suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion. A". As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the catalytic derivative derived therefrom, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon. Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal<br><br>
or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially. Preferably such cocatalysts may be represented by the following general formula:<br>
(L*-Hrd (A)d<br>
wherein:<br>
L* is a neutral Lewis base;<br>
(L*-H)+' is a Bronsted acid;<br>
Ad- is a noncoordinating, compatible anion having a charge of d-, and<br>
d is an integer from 1 to 3.<br>
More preferably Ad corresponds to the formula: [M'Q4]";<br>
wherein:<br>
M' is boron or aluminum in the +3 formal oxidation state; and<br>
Q independently each occurrence is selected from hydride, dialkylamido, halide, hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxide, halosubstituted-hydrocarbyl, hydroxy-substituted hydrocarbyl, halosubstituted hydrocarbyloxy, and halo- substituted silylhydrocarbyl radicals (including perhalogenated hydrocarbyl- perhalogenated hydrocarbyloxy- and perhalogenated silylhydrocarbyl radicals), said Q having up to 20 carbons with the proviso that in not more than one occurrence is Q halide. Examples of suitable hydrocarbyloxide Q groups are disclosed in US-A-5,296,433, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, d is one, that is, the counter ion has a single negative charge and is A'. Activating cocatalysts comprising boron which are particularly useful in the preparation of catalysts of this invention may be represented by the following general formula: (L*-H)+(BQ4)";<br>
wherein:<br>
L* is as previously defined;<br>
B is boron in a formal oxidation state of 3; and<br>
Q is a hydrocarbyl-, hydrocarbyloxy-, fluorinated hydrocarbyl-, fiuorinated hydrocarbyloxy-, or fluorinated silylhydrocarbyl- group of up to 20 nonhydrogen atoms, with the proviso that in not more than one occasion is Q hydrocarbyl.<br>
Most preferably, Q is each occurrence a fluorinated aryl group, especially, a pentafluorophenyl group.<br>

The use of the above silylium salts as activating cocatalysts for addition polymerization catalysts is claimed in USSN 08/304,314. filed September 12,1994.<br>
Certain complexes of alcohols, mercaptans, silanols, and oximes with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane are also effective catalyst activators and may be used according to the present invention. Such cocatalysts are disclosed in USP 5,296,433, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion. In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal complex catalytically inactive are not substantially formed during the reaction. More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are: liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0 to 100 °C), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert. "Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis. It is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis. Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (all isomers), dimethoxyethane (DME), and mixtures thereof.<br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively). Suitable materials of construction for the cell are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal. The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive materials that are unaffected by the<br><br>
reaction mixture or reaction conditions. Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials. Normally an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the working electrode compartment and counter electrode compartment. The working electrode is immersed in a reaction medium comprising the metal complex to be activated, solvent, supporting electrolyte, and any other materials desired for moderating the electrolysis or stabilizing the resulting complex. The counter electrode is immersed in a mixture of the solvent and supporting electrolyte. The desired voltage may be determined by theoretical calculations or experimentally by sweeping the ceil using a reference electrode such as a silver electrode immersed in the cell electrolyte. The background cell current, the current draw in the absence of the desired electrolysis, is also determined. The electrolysis is completed when the current drops from the desired level to the background level. In this manner, complete conversion of the initial metal complex can be easily detected.<br>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and a<br>
compatible, noncoordinating anion, A". Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts<br>
corresponding to the formula G+A"; wherein:<br>
G+is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex, and<br>
A" is as previously defined.<br>
Examples of cations, G+, include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms. Preferred cations are the tetra(n-butylammonium)- and tetraethylammonium- cations.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis<br>
the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A" migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product. Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode. Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of tetrakis(perfluoroaryl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or perfluoroaryl group, especially tetra(n-butylammonium)tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
A further recently discovered electrochemical technique for generation of activating cocatalysts is the electrolysis of a disilane compound in the presence of a source of a noncoordinating compatible anion. All of the foregoing techniques are<br><br>
more fully disclosed and claimed in US-A-5,372,682, In as much as the activation technique ultimately produces a cationic metal complex, the amount of such resulting complex formed during the process can be readily determined by measuring the quantity of energy used to form the activated complex in the process.<br>
The most preferred activating cocatalysts are trispentafluorophenylborane and a mixture of long chain ammonium salts of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, especially N,N-dioctadecyl-N-methylammonium tetrakpentafluorophenylborate, N-methyl-N,N-di(hexadecyl)ammonium tetrakpentafluorophenylborate and N,N-ditetradecyl-N-methylammonium tetrakpentafluorophenylborate.

Preferred monomers include monovinylidene aromatic monomers, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinyicyolohexane, norbornadiene and C2-10 aliphatic α-olefins (especially ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene), C4-40 dienes, and mixtures thereof. Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB), and dicydopentadiene (DCPD). The especially preferred dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) and 1,4-hexadiene (HD). Most preferred monomers are ethylene, mixtures of ethylene, propylene and ethylidenenorbornene, or mixtures of ethylene and a C4-8 α-olefin, especially 1-octene,<br>
In general, the polymerization may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions, that is, temperatures from 0-250 'oC, preferably 30 to 200 °C and pressures from atmospheric to 30,000 atmospheres or higher Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase, solid state powder polymerization or other process condition may be employed if desired. A support, especially silica, alumina, or a polymer (especially poly(tetrafluoroethylene) or a polyolefin) may be employed, and desirably is employed when the catalysts are used in a gas phase polymerization process. The support is preferably employed in an amount to provide a weight ratio of catalyst (based on metal):support from 1:100,000 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:50,000 to 1:20, and most preferably from 1:10,000 to 1:30.<br>
In most polymerization reactions the molar ratio of catalyst:polymerizable compounds employed is from 10-12:1 to 10-11, more preferably from 10-0:1 to 10-5:1.<br>
Suitable solvents for polymerization are inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C4-10 alkanes, and the like and aromatic and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene and the like. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers including ethylene, propylene, butadiene, cyclopentene, 1-hexene, 1-hexane, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinyicyolohexane, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1-octene,<br><br>
1-decene, styrene, divinylbenzene, allylbenzene, vinyltoluene (including all isomers alone or in admixture), and the like. Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br>
The catalysts may be utilized in combination with at least one additional homogeneous or heterogeneous polymerization catalyst in separate reactors connected in series or in parallel to prepare polymer blends having desirable properties.<br>
Utilizing the catalyst compositions of the present invention copolymers having high comonomer incorporation and correspondingly low density, yet having a low melt index may be readily prepared. That is, high molecular weight polymers are readily attained by use of the present catalysts even at elevated reactor temperatures. This result is highly desirable because the molecular weight of a-olefin copolymers can be readily reduced by the use of hydrogen or similar chain transfer agent, however increasing the molecular weight of a-olefin copolymers is usually only attainable by reducing the polymerization temperature of the reactor. Disadvantageously, operation of a polymerization reactor at reduced temperatures significantly increases the cost of operation since heat must be removed from the reactor to maintain the reduced reaction temperature, while at the same time heat must be added to the reactor effluent to vaporize the solvent. In addition, productivity is increased due to improved polymer solubility, decreased solution viscosity, and a higher polymer concentration. Utilizing the present catalyst compositions, a-olefin homopolymers and copolymers having densities from 0.85 g/cm^ to 0.96 g/cm^, and melt flow rates from 0.001 to 10.0 dg/min are readily attained in a high temperature process,<br>
The catalyst compositions of the present invention are particularly advantageous for the production of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having high levels of long chain branching. The use of the catalyst compositions of the present invention in continuous polymerization processes, especially continuous solution polymerization processes, allows for elevated reactor temperatures which favor the formation of vinyl terminated polymer chains that may be incorporated into a growing polymer, thereby giving a long chain branch. The use of the present catalyst compositions advantageously allows for the economical production of ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having processability similar to high pressure, free radical produced low density polyethylene.<br>
The present catalysts system may be advantageously employed to prepare olefin polymers having improved processing properties by polymerizing ethylene alone or ethylene/a-olefin mixtures with low levels of a "H" branch inducing diene,<br><br>
such as norbornadiene, 1,7-octadiene, or 1,9-decadiene. The unique combination of elevated reactor temperatures, high molecular weight (or low melt indices) at high reactor temperatures and high comonomer reactivity advantageously allows for the economical production of polymers having excellent physical properties and processability. Preferably such polymers comprise ethylene, a C3.20 a-olefin and a "H""branching comonomer. Preferably, such polymers are produced in a solution process, most preferably a continuous solution process.<br>
As previously mentioned, the present catalyst composition is particularly useful in the preparation of EP and EPDM copolymers in high yield and productivity. The process employed may be either a solution or slurry process both of which are previously known in the art. Kaminsky, J, Polv. Sci., Vol. 23, pp. 2151-64 (1985) reported the use of a soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dimethyl-alumoxane catalyst system for solution polymerization of EP and EPDM elastomers. US-A-5,229,478 disclosed a slurry polymerization process utilizing similar bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium based catalyst systems.<br>
The catalyst composition may be prepared as a homogeneous catalyst by addition of the requisite components to a solvent in which polymerization will be carried out by solution polymerization procedures. The catalyst system may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing the requisite components on a catalyst support material such as silica gel, alumina or other suitable inorganic support material. When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, it is preferred to use silica as the support material. The heterogeneous form of the catalyst system is employed in a slurry polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 carbon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Likewise the a-olefin monomer or a mixture of different a-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Most preferably the diluent comprises in at least major part the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
In contrast, solution polymerization conditions utilize a solvent for the respective components of the reaction, particularly the EP or EPDM polymer. Preferred solvents include mineral oils and the various hydrocarbons which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Illustrative examples of useful solvents include alkanes such as pentane, iso-pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and nonane, as well as<br><br>
mixtures of alkanes including kerosene and Isopar E™, available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.; cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane; and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethyibenzene and diethylbenzene.<br>
At ail times, the individual ingredients as well as the recovered catalyst components must be protected from oxygen and moisture. Therefore, the catalyst components and catalysts must be prepared and recovered in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere. Preferably, therefore, the reactions are performed in the presence of an dry, inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
Generally the polymerization process is carried out with a differential pressure of ethylene of from about 10 to about 1000 psi (70 to 7000 kPa), most preferably from about 40 to about 400 psi (30 to 300 kPa). The polymerization is generally conducted at a temperature of from 25 to 200 °C, preferably from 75 to 170 'G, and most preferably from greater than 95 to 160 °C.<br>
The polymerization may be carried out as a batchwise or a continuous polymerization process A continuous process is preferred, in which event catalyst, ethylene, a-oiefin, and optionally solvent and diene are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed therefrom.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that the invention disclosed herein may be practiced in the absence of any component which has not been specifically disclosed. The following examples are provided as further illustration of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting. Unless stated to the contrary all parts and percentages are expressed on a weight basis.<br>
Example 1<br>
A stirred 3.8 liter reactor was charged with about 1440 g of Isopar-E™ mixed alkanes solvent (available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.) and about 130 g of 1-octene comonomer. Hydrogen (10 mMol) was added as a molecular weight control agent using a mass flow meter. The reactor was heated to the polymerization temperature of 130 oC and saturated with ethylene at 450 psig (3.1 MPa). Catalyst ((t-butylamido)dimethyl('η5 -tetramethylcyclopenta-dienyl)silanetitanium (II) η-l ,3-pentadiene (Tl), or bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)-zirconium dimethyl (ZR)) and cocatalyst (trispentafluorophenylborane (FAB), bis-hydrogenated tallowalkyi methylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (BFA), or bis-hydrogenated tallowalkyi methylammonium hydroxyphenyltris(pentafluoro-phenyl)borate (BHI)) were dissolved in Isopar E™ and premixed in a drybox with diethylaluminum-N,N-<br><br>
diisopropylamide (DEA) or diisobutylaluminurn-N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (DIB), and transferred to a catalyst addition system and injected into the reactor over approximately 4 minutes using a flow of high pressure Isopar E™ solvent. The polymerization conditions were maintained for 10 minutes with ethylene supplied on demand to maintain 450 psig reactor pressure.
