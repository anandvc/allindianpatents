COMBINATION PACKAGE AND DISPENSING DEVICE FOR A LAVATORY TREATMENT COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a combination packaging and dispensing device for a lavatory treatment composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a combination packaging and dispensing device for a lavatory treatment composition, most preferably a lavatory block composition which is preferably suspended upon a portion of a container i.e. such as a lavatory cistern or alternatively another vessel such as a pail, bucket or other containers situated for containing a quantity of a liquid.<br>
The prior art discloses various devices which are useful in providing a means to supporting a lavatory block composition within a part of a lavatory appliance such as a toilet, bidet, or the like. Such devices are typically intended to be suspended upon, or attached to a part of a lavatory appliance such that water either continuously or intermittently comes into contact with a cake or a block of a treatment composition which provides a beneficial effect, clean, and/or disinfecting flash sanitization of at least a portion of a lavatory appliance. Such devices are typically separated as to their mode of operation, that is to say whether they are primarily intended to be suspended upon a portion of the upper water supply tank, interchangeably refers to as the cistern, such that a block or cake of a lavatory treatment composition is either intermittently or alternately continuously immersed or at least partially immersed within the water present in such a cistern, or whether the device is intended to suspend the cake or block within a part of the toilet bowl, such that water flushing the toilet bowl comes into contact with the suspended cake or block, thereby forming a treatment composition which provides a fragrancing and/or cleaning and/or sanitizing and/or disinfecting benefits to the toilet bowl. The former type or typically referred to as "in-the-cistern" ("ITC") devices, whether lateral or typically referred to as 'in-the-" ("ITB") devices. Any such devices of either the ITB or ITC class have been known for at least several decades.<br><br>
The problem with such prior art ITB and ITC type devices that typically require an undue amount of packaging in order to enclose them prior to their use. While such packaging maybe of a rather minimum configuration such as a film formed from a synthetic polymer or metal in order to form an envelope-type packaging containing such a ITB or ITC device, typically the packaging is much more complicated as frequently the packaging provides not only a means for containing an ITB or an ITC type device prior to its use, but is frequently simultaneously intended to provide an advertising display for the said ITB or ITC device. Such typically requires an excess use of packaging materials, such as paper, board, fiber board, coated papers, and/or polymer films, as well as blister-molded polymeric packages in order to suitably and attractively display the said device. Such however, is particularly wasteful and that it forms no actual part of the ITB or ITC type device which is intended to be used. Such packaging, while attractive, is typically environmentally unfriendly and that it serves no function other than display of the said ITB or ITC type device prior to its use, and once the ITB or ITC type device is withdrawn for use, the packaging needs to be discarded. Such undesirably contributes to the bulk of growing landfills, or requires an energy-intensive recycling and reclamation step in order to salvage the materials from which said packaging is made.<br>
As noted before, minimal type packaging is also known however, this to requires for the disposal of at least a film wrapper, or polymer film envelope which also contributes unnecessary and undesired waste.<br>
Thus, there is a real and continuing need in the art for improved lavatory packaging, and for dispensing devices (ITB or ITC type devices, as well as other devices) and in particularly in need for such dispensing devices which provide both a useful packaging construction adapted for storing a lavatory treatment composition particularly in the form of a solid or gel typed composition, prior to its use, and which said device also may be used as a dispenser for said lavatory treatment composition. The ducts, a major portion of the combination packaging and dispensing device taught herein can be used for both displaying the lavatory treatment composition prior to its use, as well as dispensing it into a volume of water which is caused to come into contact with the treatment block or other lavatory treatment compositions contained therein.<br><br>
In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a combination packaging and dispensing device for containing a quantity of lavatory treatment composition, preferably in the form of a compressed solid block, or in the form of paste or gel such as a self-supporting paste or gel composition, which device comprises a supporting plate of a generally planar configuration, said supporting plate having integrally formed therein a hanger means, and extending outward from one side of the supporting plate is a block housing adapted to contain a quantity of a lavatory treatment composition. The block housing further comprises at least one perforation passing therethrough, preferably at least two perforations passing therethrough whereby water coming into contact with a portion of the block housing may pass into the interior of the block housing, and into contact with the lavatory treatment composition contained therein, and thereafter exit through either the same, or a different perforation in the block housing and thereby exit the said device.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention there is provided a combination packaging and dispensing device which is in accordance with the aforesaid first embodiment, which further comprises at least two perforations within the block housing, wherein said perforations are diametrically opposed, that is to say about 180 degrees of angle, with respect to one another.<br>
According to a third and further embodiment of the invention is provided a combination packaging and dispensing device according to the first and/or second embodiments of the invention which comprises a hanger means when hanger means comprises at least two flexible elements which are integrally formed with a portion of the supporting plate and which are adapted flex outside of the plane generally defined by the supporting plate.<br>
According to a fourth embodiment of the invenfion has provided a method for providing a liquid treatment composition useful in the treatment of the lavatory appliance, or other vessel capable of containing a liquid i.e., a pail or bucket, which method comprises the step of:<br>
providing a combination packaging and dispensing as described herein and suspending it via the hanger mans on a part of a lavatory appliance or said other vessel, and subsequently supplying water to the lavatory treatment block contained within the<br><br>
block housing of said device so to form a liquid treatment composition which thereafter exits the block housing and is supplied to the lavatory appliance or vessel.<br>
According to a still further embodiment of the invention as provided as vendible article, a combination packaging and dispensing device according to any of the aforesaid embodiments of the invention.<br>
According to a still further embodiment of the invention as provided a method for the manufacture of a combination packaging dispensing device according to any of the foregoing embodiments of the invention.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will become more evident from a review of the following specification.<br>
As noted above, the present invention provides a combined packaging and dispensing device which is adapted for both containing a lavatory treatment composition, and for dispensing a liquid treatment composition formed by the contact of a liquid, e.g., water, with the lavatory treatment composition contained within said device. The lavatory treatment composition is preferably a self-supporting mass of a material which contains one or more chemical compounds and compositions which can provide a useful treatment benefit to a lavatory appliance when it is contacted by a liquid, especially water which flows into and subsequently out of the block housing of the said device which contains the lavatory treatment composition.<br>
Generally speaking, in preferred embodiments the device according to the invention comprises a supporting plate which is advantageously of a generally rectangular configuration, and with supporting plate is generally planar in configuration. The supporting plate preferably also includes an integrally formed hanger means, which hanger means is adapted to be flexed either inwardly or outwardly, alternatively, upwardly, or downwardly, out of the plane as generally defined by the supporting plate. The supporting plate may comprise one or more perforations, e.g., slits, slots, or holes which can be used to define the hanger means such that a user can easily breach a part or parts of the supporting plate in the region of the one or more perforations, slots, or holes to form the hanger means. By way of non-limiting example, advantageously one or more perforations can be pierced through the supporting plate, the margins of said slots defining the edges and/or sides of a portion of the hanger means. Wherein the supporting<br><br>
plate is made of a flexible material, such as the thermoplastic material, fibrous material, or other suitable material, the hanger means portion of the supporting plate is defined between or by the lines or pierced slots passing through the supporting plate can be readily flexed out of the plane as generally defined by its supporting plate. Such an operation will be more readily understood with reference to the following figures.<br>
Advantageously, at an opposite ends of the supporting plate, or in proximity thereto, the supporting plate comprises a block housing which extends outwardly from at least one side of the supporting plate. The block housing can be a self supporting structure, and ideally is a rigid housing having a portion, such as a lower margin or a bottom, which is fixed to the supporting plate and form a liquid tight seal therewith. In such a way. the block housings is simultaneously supported by, and extends outwardly from one face of the supporting plate. Ideally the block housing is configured to accept and to retain within its interior a quantity of a treatment composition, ideally in the form of a solid block, compressed block, or self supporting gel composition which can be retained within the interior of the block housing. The block housing preferably includes at least one sidewall, and/or an end wall having passing therethrough at least one perforation, although preferably the block housing has at least two perforations passing there through.   The function of the perforations is such that when water or other liquid is poured onto the exterior of the supporting plate and more particularly, on the exterior of the block housing, at least part of the water other liquid passes into the interior of the block housing or in comes into contact with the lavatory treatment composifion. Such contact causes the elution of a portion of said lavatory treatment composition into the water or other liquid and causes the formation of the liquid treatment composition which can subsequently exit the interior of the block housing via the same perforation through which the water or other liquid entered, or via a different (i.e. at least second) perforation whereby it can subsequently be collected and retained in a suitable vessel, e.g., a pail or tank, or can be directly used to treat a lavatory appliance, e.g., a toilet, urinal, bidet or the like.   In particularly preferred embodiments, the block housing comprises at least two diametrically opposed perforations, ideally such diametrically opposed perforations are positioned such that at least one of said perforations is positioned proximate to the hanger means while the opposite perforations is located on the opposite side of the block<br><br>
housing, that is to stay at position away from the hanger means. In such an arrangement also the perforations which are approximate the hanger means are "upward" direction when said device is fixed to a container or lavatory appliance, and the opposite, distally located perforation of perforations, are "downwardly" directed. Thus, the upper perforations approximate the hangers does act as an "inlet" for water, while the "bottom" perforations function as a "drain" and permit the liquid treatment composition formed by contacting water with the lavatory treatment composition to exit the block housing and fall downwardly and into a vessel, or lavatory appliance.<br>
The device according to the present invention can include any of a number of other additional elements which are however, not essential to the present invention.<br>
For example, a portion of the supporting plate and/or an additional element which can be affixed or formed part of the supporting claim can be used as a stiffening member. Such for example may be an indent, recess, or channel which can be affixed to or formed as an integral part of the supporting plate, particularly if such is formed of a moldable materia] such as a thermoplastic material, a foil, a metal, and the like. Such can be used to stiffen a portion of, or all of the supporting plate.<br>
By way of further example the device according to the invention may include an additional hanger means or other element which is not integrally formed as part of the support plate, but rather may be a separate element which may be affixed thereto and used to suspend the device.<br>
The supporting plate can include one or more further perforations passing there through such as one or more slits, slots or holes, either circular, square, elliptical, or for that matter, of any geometric shape. Such holes can be used as stress-release points, and can also be used to define "hinge-lines" about which a portion of the hanger means can bend either inwardly or outwardly with respect to the supporting plate. Such holes can be used to provide a convenient means for hanging or displaying the combination packaging of dispensing device according to the invention. The other aspects of the present invention will be better understood with reference to the preferred embodiments which are discussed in the accompanying figures.<br>
The combination packaging and dispensing devices of the invention, whether formed of a single unitary piece or assembled from a composite of discrete pieces or<br><br>
elements may be formed from any of a variety of materials which can be used for the purpose described herein. Exemplary and preferred materials include metals including metal sheets, metal or metallic foils, as well as one or more synthetic polymers which are preferred. Preferably the device may be formed of any of a number of thermosettable or thermoformable synthetic polymers such as are widely used. Exemplary synthetic polymers such as polyamides, polyolefins (e.g., polypropylene, polyethylene) as well as polyalkyleneterephalates (i.e., polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate), polystyrenes, polysulfones, polycarbonates as well as copolymers formed from monomers of one or more of the foregoing being several nonlimiting examples of useful synthetic polymers. Preferably the material of construction is at least somewhat flexible, and is not deleteriously affected by the chemical constituents of the lavatory treatment composition. The combination packaging and dispensing devices according to the invention are advantageously and easily formed by using a moldable synthetic thermoplastic polymer, particularly one which may be formed in vacuum/draw molding operations, or which can be injection molded to provide a final form of the said device. The combination packaging and dispensing devices according to the invention necessarily comprise a lavatory treatment composition which may be a tablet, cake, lavatory treatment composition or gel which includes at least one or more chemical constituents such that when the lavatory treatment composition is immersed, rinsed or washed with water, said chemical constituents are eluted or dissolved into said water and forms a liquid treatment composition which is useful in treating a sanitary appliance, and particularly a toilet tank or cistern or a toilet bowl, or which may be collected in a container such a s pail or other vessel for subsequent use. Such a liquid treatment composition may provide fragrancing and/or cleaning and/or sanitizing and/or disinfecting benefit to a toilet or other sanitary appliance being treated with the combination packaging and dispensing devices of the invention. Alternately, as noted, the such a liquid treatment composition may provide fragrancing and/or cleaning and/or sanitizing and/or disinfecting benefit to a lavatory surface by subsequent application of a liquid treatment composition which has been previously formed and stored in a vessel, e.g., a pail.<br><br>
The lavatory treatment composition may be of any physical dimension or configuration, but is desirably configured to fit within the interior of the block housing, advantageously the lavatory treatment composition is provided in a shape which approximates the shape of the interior of the block housing. For example, if the block brusing is generally cylindrical in configuration, advantageously the lavatory treatment imposition is provided in a cylindrical configuration, having a height and diameter aapted to be insertable within the block housing. Where the block housing is generally aquare or rectangular in configuration, advantageously the lavatory treatment composition is provided in a correspondingly square or rectangular configuration, having height, length and width dimensions which are adapted to be insertable within the block<br>
brusing.<br>
The lavatory treatment composition can be a single element or can be a plurality elements. The lavatory treatment composition can be a single monolithic mass, e.g.. a tablet, cake or block having a single homogenous chemical composition or may include different parts or regions of dissimilar chemical composition, e.g., a coextruded composition or a laminated composition. Alternately the block housing can contain a urality of elements which may have the same or different chemical compositions. The vatory treatment composition may be a semi-solid material such as a paste or a gel, or may  be a composition which includes two or more of: a solid chemical composition, a waste and a gel. Preferably the lavatory treatment composition is in the form of a tablet, like or block as such can be readily produced by known art processes, e.g., extrusion and/or tabletting processes.<br>
The lavatory treatment composition may include any known art cleaning agents or eaning constituents known to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art, and without imitation include one or more detersive surfactants selected from anionic, cationic, onionic as well as amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants. Certain detersive surfactants may also provide a dual role in providing detergency as well as a disinfecting effect, viz, cerrtain cationic surfactants, which are described hereinafter as a disinfecting agent. These  or more cleaning agents or cleaning constituents may be used with or without other instituents being present in the lavatory treatment compositions of the invention.<br><br>
Desirably the lavatory treatment composition of the invention comprises a surfactant constituent which may be one or more detersive surfactants. Exemplary useful surfactants include anionic, nonionic, cationic, amphoteric, and zwitterionic surfactants, particularly those whose melting points are sufficiently high, above about 110oF., preferably above 125°F., to permit processing according to known art techniques. However, small amounts of low melting point surfactants and even liquid surfactants may be used in providing the surfactant constituent.<br>
Exemplary useful anionic surfactants which may be used in the lavatory treatment composition of the invention can be broadly described as the water-soluble salts, particularly the alkali metal salts, of organic sulfuric acid reaction products having in their molecular structure an alkyl or alkaryl radical containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms and a radical selected from the group consisting of sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid ester radicals. (Included in the term alkyl is the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals.) Important examples of the anionic surfactants which can be employed in practicing the present invention are the sodium or potassium alkyl sulfates, especially those obtained by sulfating the higher alcohols (C8 -C18 carbon atoms) produced by reducing the glycerides of tallow or coconut oil; sodium or potassium alkyl benzene sulfonates, in which the alkyl group contains from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms, (the alkyl radical can be a straight or branched aliphatic chain); paraffin sulfonate surfactants having the general formula RSO3 M, wherein R is a primary or secondary alkyl group containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms (preferably 10 to 18 carbon atoms) and M is an alkali metal, e.g., sodium, lithium or potassium; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow and coconut oil; sodium coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulfates and sulfonates; sodium or potassium salts of sulfuric acid esters of the reaction product of one mole of a higher fatty alcohol (e.g., tallow or coconut oil alcohols) and about 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide; sodium or potassium salts of alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulfates with about 1 to about 10 units of ethylene oxide per molecule and in which the alkyl radicals contain from about 8 to about 12 carbon atoms; the reaction products of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil; sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid amides of a methyl<br><br>
tauride in which the fatty acids, for example, are derived from coconut oil and sodium or potassium β-acetoxy- or β-acetamido-alkanesuIfonates where the alkane has from 8 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
A preferred class of anionic surfactants are linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant wherein the alkyl portion contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms, and most preferably about 11 to 13 carbon atoms. According to particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the lavatory treatment compositions necessarily include an anionic surfactant.<br>
A further preferred class of anionic surfactants are alpha olefin sulfonates, as well as salts thereof, e.g., alkali metal salts. Preferred are C8 through C22 alpha olefin sulfonates, particularly C12 through C18, and especially C14, and C16 alpha olefin sulfonates as well as blends of two or more thereof. According to particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the lavatory treatemtn compositions when in the form of a solid block necessarily include a sulfonate anionic surfactant.<br>
The detersive surfactant constituent of the lavatory treatment composition of the invention may include one or more nonionic surfactants. Practically any hydrophobic compound having a carboxy, hydroxy, amido, or amino group with a free hydrogen attached to the nitrogen can be condensed with an alkylene oxide, especially ethylene oxide or with the polyhydration product thereof, a poiyalkylene glycol, especially polyethylene glycol, to form a water soluble or water dispersible nonionic surfactant compound. Further, the length of the polyethenoxy hydrophobic and hydiophilic elements may various. Exemplary nonionic compounds include the polyoxyethylene ethers of alkyl aromatic hydroxy compounds, e.g., alkylated polyoxyethylene phenols, polyoxyethylene ethers of long chain aliphafic alcohols, the polyoxyethylene ethersof hydrophobic propylene oxide polymers, and the higher alkyl amine oxides.<br>
One class of useful nonionic surfactants include poiyalkylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols. These compounds include the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 12 carbon atoms in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration with an alkylene oxide, especially an ethylene oxide, the ethylene oxide being present in an amount equal to 5 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol. The alkyl subsfituent in such compounds can be derived, for example, from polymerized propylene, diisobutylene and the like. Examples of<br><br>
compounds of this type include nonyl phenol condensed with about 9.5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of nonyl phenol; dodecylphenol condensed with about 12 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of phenol; dinonyl phenol condensed with about 15 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of phenol and diisooctyl phenol condensed with about 15 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of phenol.<br>
A further class of useful nonionic surfactants include the condensation products of aliphatic alcohols with from about 1 to about 60 moles of an alkylene oxide, especially an ethylene oxide. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol can either be straight or branched, primary or secondary, and generally contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. Examples of such ethoxylated alcohols include the condensation product of myristyl alcohol condensed with about 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol and the condensation product of about 9 moles of ethylene oxide with coconut alcohol (a mixture of fatty alcohols with alkyl chains varying in length from about 10 to 14 carbon atoms). Other examples are those C6-C14 straight-chain alcohols which are ethoxylated with from about 3 to about 6 moles of ethylene oxide. Their derivation is well known in the art. Examples include Alfonic® 810-4.5, which is described in product literature from Sasol as a C8-C10 straight-chain alcohol having an average molecular weight of 356, an ethylene oxide content of about 4.85 moles (about 60 wt.%), and an HLB of about 12; Alfonic® 810-2, which is described in product literature as a C8-C10 straight-chain alcohols having an average molecular weight of 242, an ethylene oxide content of about 2.1 moles (about 40 wt.%), and an HLB of about 12; and Alfonic® 610-3.5, which is described in product literature as having an average molecular weight of 276, an ethylene oxide content of about 3.1 moles (about 50 wt.%), and an HLB of 10. Other examples of alcohol ethoxylates are Cm oxo-alcohol ethoxylates available from BASF under the Lutensol® ON tradename. They are available in grades containing from about 3 to about 11 moles of ethylene oxide (available under the names Lutensol® ON 30; Lutensol® ON 50; Lutensol® ON 60; Lutensol® ON 65; Lutensol® ON 66; Lutensol® ON 70; Lutensol® ON 80; and Lutensol®ON 110). Other examples of ethoxylated alcohols include the Neodol® 91 series non-ionic surfactants available from Shell Chemical Company which are described as C9-C11 ethoxylated alcohols. The Neodol® 91 series non-ionic surfactants of interest include Neodol® 91-2.5, Neodol® 91-6, and Neodol®<br><br>
91-8. Neodol® 91-2.5 has been described as having about 2.5 ethoxy groups per molecule; Neodol 91-6 has been described as having about 6 ethoxy groups per molecule; and Neodol 91-8 has been described as having about 8 ethoxy groups per molecule. Further examples of ethoxylated alcohols include the Rhodasurf® DA series non-ionic surfactants available from Rhodia which are described to be branched isodecyl alcohol ethoxylates. Rhodasurf® DA-530 has been described as having 4 moles of ethoxylation and an HLB of 10.5; Rhodasurf® DA-630 has been described as having 6 moles of ethoxylation with an HLB of 12.5; and Rhodasurf® DA-639 is a 90% solution of DA-630.

when formulated as dry powders to enable direct incorporation into lavatory treatment composition s of the invention, however, liquid colorants may be employed in conjunction with suitable carriers. Useful colorants include any materials which may provide a desired coloring effect. Exemplarly useful coloring agents include dyes, e.g.. Alizarine Light Blue B (C.I. 63010), Carta Blue VP (C.I. 24401), Acid Green 2G (C.I. 42085), Astragon Green D (C.I. 42040) Supranol Cyanine 7B (C.I. 42675), Maxilon Blue 3RL (C.I.

Acid Blue 182), FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, FD&amp;C Green No. 3 and Acid Blue No. 9. When a bleach constituent is included in the lavatory treatment composition, the colorant, e.g., dye, should be selected so to ensure the compatibility of the colorant with the bleach constituent, or so that its color persists despite the presence in the toilet bowl of a concentration of hypochlorite which is effective to maintain sanitary conditions. Frequently however, a lavatory treatment composition which includes a bleach constituent do not comprise any colorants. Desirably the colorants, when present, do not exceed 15%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective. When present, colorants are desirably present in an amount from about 0.1 to 15 percent of the total weight of the chemical composition.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may include a fragrance or other air treatment constituent. The fragrance may be any composition which is known to the art to provide a perceptible fragrancing benefit, any may be based on naturally occurring materials such as one or more essential oils, or may be based on synthetically produced compounds as well.

Many of these essential function as a fragrance agent, which fragrance agent which may be a substance or mixture of various substances including those which are naturally derived (i.e., obtained by extraction of flower, herb, blossom or plant), those which are artificially derived or produced (i.e., mixture of natural oils and/or oil constituents), and those which are synthetically produced substances (odiferous substances). Generally fragrance agents are complex mixtures or blends various organic compounds including, but not limited to, certain alcohols, aldehydes, ethers, alamatic compounds and varying amounts of essential oils such as from about 0 to about 25% by weight, usually from about 0.05 to about 12% by weight, the essential oils themselves being volatile odiferous compounds and also functioning to aid in the dissolution of the other components of the fragrance agent. In the present invention, the precise composition of the fragrance agent desirably emanates a pleasing fragrance, but the nature of the fragrance agent is not critical to the success of the invention.<br>
As noted above, in conjunction with or in the absence of a fragrance constituent, the lavatory treatment compositions may comprise an air treatment constituent. Such may be any other material which is useful in providing treatment of ambient air, such as a sanitizing agents . e.g., one or more glycols or alcohols, or materials which are intended to counteract, neutralize, or mask odors in the absence of, or in conjunction with, the fragrance composition of the present invention. Alternatively, the air treatment constituent may be one or more materials which provide and effective insecticide repelling or insecticidal benefit; such would be particularly useful in climates or environments where insects present a nuisance or health hazard.<br>
As further chemical constituents, the lavatory treatment compositions of the invention may comprise an anti-limescale agent, which can be generally classified as a<br><br>
cleaning agent in that it provides a cleaning effect to treated lavatory device surfaces. The anti-limescaie agent can virtually any known anti-limescale agent compositions known to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art. For example, compositions containing anionic and/or nonionic surfactants together with typical anti-limescale agents, for example, amidosulfonic acid, bisulfate salts, organic acids, organic phosphoric salts, alkali metal polyphosphates, and the like. Examples of anti-limescale agent compositions can be found in. for example. United States Patent Nos. 5,759,974; 4460490; and 4578207, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Further examples of anti-limescale agents include organic acids (for example, citric acid, lactic acid, adipic acid, oxalic acid and the like), organic phosphoric salts, alkali metal polyphosphates, sulfonic, and sulfamic acids and their salts, bisulfate salts, EDTA, phosphonates, and the like.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may comprise stain inhibiting materials. The lavatory treatment composition of the invention may, for example, include an effective amount of a manganese stain inhibiting agent which is advantageously included wherein the sanitary appliance is supplied by a water source having an appreciable or high amount of manganese. Such water containing a high manganese content are known to frequently deposit unsightly stains on surfaces of sanitary appliances, especially when the lavatory treatment composition also contains a bleach source which provides a hypochlorite. To counteract such an effect the lavatory treatment composition of the present invention may comprise a manganese stain inhibiting agent, such as a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide having a molecular weight of about 2000 to about 10,000, a polyacrylate with a molecular weight of about 2000 to about 10,000, and/or copolymers of ethylene and maleic acid anhydride with a molecular weight of from about 20,000 to about 100,000. When present the satin inhibiting materials may comprise to about 10%wi. of the weight of the lavatory treatment composition.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions of the invention may include one or more preservatives. Such preservatives are primarily included to reduce the growth of undesired microorganisms within the treatment blocks formed from the lavatory treatment composition during storage prior to use or while used, although it is expected that the such a preservative may impart a beneficial antimicrobial effect to the water in the sanitary appliance to which the treatment block is provided. Exemplary useful<br><br>
preservatives include compositions which include parabens, including methyl parabens and ethyl parabens, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, 2-bromo-2-nitropropoane-l,3-diol, 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one, and mixtures thereof. One exemplary composition is a combination 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one where the amount of either component may be present in the mixture anywhere from 0.001 to 99.99 weight percent, based on the total amount of the preservative. For reasons of availability, the most preferred preservative are those commercially available preservative comprising a mixture of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one marketed under the trademark KATHON® CG/ICP as a preservative composition presently commercially available from Rohm and Haas (Philadelphia, PA).   Further usefvil preservative compositions include KATHON® CG/ICP II, a further preservative composition presently commercially available from Rohm and Haas (Philadelphia, PA), PROXEL® which is presently commercially available from Zeneca Biocides (Wilmington, DE), SUTTOCIDE® A which is presently commercially available from Sutton Laboratories (Chatam, NJ) as well as TEXTAMER® 3SAD which is presently commercially available from Calgon Corp. (Pittsburgh, PA). When present, the optional preservative constituent should not exceed about 5%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may also include a binder constituent. The binder may function in part controlling the rate of dissolution of the tablet. The binder constituent may be a clay, but preferably is a water-soluble or water-dispersible gel-forming organic polymer. The term "gel-forming" as applied to this polymer is intended to indicate that on dissolution or dispersion in water it first forms a gel which, upon dilution with further water, is dissolved or dispersed to form a free-flowing liquid. The organic polymer serves essentially as binder for the tablets produced in accordance with the invention although, as will be appreciated, certain of the polymers envisaged for use in accordance with the invention also have surface active properties and thereby serve not only as binders but also enhance the cleansing ability of the tablets of the invention. Further certain organic polymers, such as substituted celluloses, also serve as soil antiredeposition agents. A wide variety of water-soluble organic polymers are suitable for<br><br>
use in the lavatory treatment composition of the present invention. Such polymers may be wholly synthetic or may be semi-synthetic organic polymers derived from natural materials. Thus, for example, on class of organic polymers for use in accordance with the invention are chemically modified celluloses such as ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose,      sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxy ethyl cellulose. Another class of organic polymers which may be used include naturally derived or manufactured (fermented) polymeric materials such as alginates and carageenan. Also, water-soluble starches and gelatin may be used as the optional binder     constituent.   The cellulose based binders are a preferred class of binders for use in the lavatory treatment composition and may possess the property of inverse solubility that is their solubility decreases with increasing temperature, thereby rendering the tablets of the invention suitable for use in locations having a relatively high ambient temperature.<br>
The optional binder constituent may also be one or more synthetic polymers e,g,      polyvinyl alcohols; water-soluble partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates;<br>
polyacrylonitriles; polyvinyl pyrrolidones; water-soluble polymers of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, and salts thereof; base-hydrolysed starch-polyacrylonitrile copolymers; polyacrylamides; ethylene oxide polymers and copolymers; as well as carboxypolymethylenes.<br>
In the case of the organic polymeric binders it may be noted that, in general, the higher the molecular weight of the polymer the greater the in-use life of the treatment block of the invention. When present, the total binder content may comprise up to 75%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, but preferably is from 0.5 to 70% by weight, preferably from 1 to 65% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 60% by weight.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may optionally include one or more dissolution control agents. Such dissolution control agent are materials which provide a degree of hydrophobicity to the treatment block formed from the lavatory treatment composition whose presence in the treatment block contributes to the slow uniform dissolution of the treatment block when contacted with water, and simultaneously the controlled release of the active constituents of the lavatory treatment composition. Preferred for use as the dissolution control agents are mono- or di-alkanol amides derived<br><br>
from C8-C18, fatty acids, especially C12-C14 fatty acids having a C2-C6 monoamine or diamine moiety. When included the dissolution control agent may be included in any effective amount, but desirably the dissolution control agent is present in an amount not to exceed about 600%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective. Generally wherein the lavatory treatment composition is to be used in an ITB application the dissolution control agent is present to about 12%wt., more preferably is present from 0.1 - 10%wt. and most preferably is present from about 3 - 8%wt. of the lavatory treatment compositions, as well as in the treatment blocks formed therefrom. Generally wherein the lavatory treatment composition is to be used in an ITC application the dissolution control agent is present to about 50%wt,, more preferably is present from 1 - 50%wt. and most preferably is present from about 10 - 40%wt, of the lavatory treatment composition, such as in treatment blocks formed therefrom.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may optionally include one or more water-softening agents or one or more chelating agents, for example inorganic water-softening agents such as sodium hexametaphosphate or other alkali metal polyphosphates or organic water-softening agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid and alkali metal salts thereof. When present, such water-softening agents or chelating agents should not exceed about 20%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may optionally include one or more solid water-soluble acids or acid-release agents such as sulphamic acid, citric acid or sodium hydrogen sulphate. When present, such solid water-soluble acids or acid-release agents should not exceed about 20%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may include diluent materials may be included to provide additional bulk of the product lavatory treatment composition and may enhance leaching out of the surfactant constituent when the lavatory treatment composition is placed in water. Exemplary diluent materials include any soluble inorganic alkali, alkaline earth metal salt or hydrate thereof, for example, chlorides such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride and the like, carbonates and bicarbonates such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like, sulfates such as magnesium<br><br>
sulfate, copper sulfate, sodium sulfate, zinc sulfate and the like, borax, borates such as sodium borate and the like, as well as others known to the art but not particularly recited herein. Exemplary organic diluents include, inter alia, urea, as well as water soluble high molecular weight polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. When present, such diluent materials should not exceed about 80%wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions and treatment blocks formed therefrom may include one or more fillers. Such fillers are typically particulate solid water-insoluble materials which may be based on inorganic materials such as talc or silica, particulate organic polymeric materials such as finely comminuted water insoluble synthetic polymers. When present, such fillers should not exceed about 30%wt. of the lavatory treatmentiComposition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effective.<br>
Preferably the lavatory treatment composition of the invention includes silica. Silica has been observed to aid in the controlling the rate of dissolution of the lavatory treatment compositions of the invention.<br>
The lavatory treatment compositions and treatment blocks formed therefrom may include one or more further processing aids. For example, the lavatory treatment composition may also include other binding and/or plasticizing ingredients serving to assist in the manufacture thereof, for example, polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight from about 300 to about 10,000 in an amount up to about 20% by weight, preferably about 4% to about 15% by weight of the mixture may be used. The polypropylene glycol reduces the melt viscosity, acts as a demolding agent and also acts to plasticize the block when the composition is prepared by a casting process. Other suitable plasticizers such as pine oil fractions, d-limonene, dipentene and the ethylene oxide-propylene oxide block copolymers may be utilized. Other useful processing aids include tabletting lubricants such as metallic stearates, stearic acid, paraffin oils or waxes or sodium borate which facilitate in the formation of the treatment blocks in a tabletting press or die.<br>
One advantageously utilized processing aid is a diester constituent which may be represented by the following structure:<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
R' and R can independently be C1-C6 alkyl which may optionally substituted,<br>
Y is (CH2)x, wherein x is 0-10, but is preferably 1-8, and while Y may be a linear alkyl or<br>
phenyl moiety, desirably Y includes one or more oxygen atoms and/or is a branched<br>
moiety.<br>
Exemplary diester constituents include the following diester compounds according to the foregoing structure: dimethyl oxalate, diethyl oxalate, diethyl oxalate, dipropyl oxalate, dibutyl oxalate, diisobutyl oxalate, dimethyl succinate, diethyl succinate, diethylhexyl succinate, dimethyl glutarate, diisostearyl glutarate, dimethyl adipate, diethyl adipate, diisopropyl adipate, dipropyl adipate, dibutyl adipate, diisobutyl adipate, dihexyladipate, di-C12-15-alkyl adipate, dicapryl adipate, dicetyl adipate, diisodecyl adipate, diisocetyl adipate, diisononyl adipate, diheptylundecyl adipate, ditridecyl adipate, diisostearyl adipate, diethyl sebacate, diisopropyl sebacate, dibutyl sebacate, diethylhexylsebacate, diisocetyl dodecanedioate, dimethyl brassylate, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate.<br>
Preferred diester constituents include those wherein Y is -(CH2)x- wherein x has a value of from 0-6, preferably a value of 0 - 5, more preferably a value of from 1-4, while R and R are C1-C6 alkyl groups which may be straight chained alkyl but preferably are branched, e.g, iso- and tert-moieties. Particularly preferred diester compounds are those in which the compounds terminate in ester groups.<br>
A further advantageously utilized processing aid is a hydrocarbon solvent constituent. The hydrocarbon solvents are immiscible in water, may be linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons having from about 6 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably comprising from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms. Saturated hydrocarbons are preferred, as are branched hydrocarbons. Such hydrocarbon solvents are typically available as technical grade mixtures of two or more specific solvent compounds, and are often petroleum distillates. Nonlimiting examples of some suitable linear hydrocarbons include decane, dodecane, decene, tridecene, and combinations<br><br>
thereof. Mineral oil is one particularly preferred form of a useful hydrocarbon solvent. Further preferred hydrocarbon solvents include paraffinic hydrocarbons including both linear and branched paraffinic hydrocarbons. The former are commercially available as NORPAR solvents (ex. ExxonMobil Corp.) while the latter are available as ISOPAR solvents (ex. ExxonMobil Corp.) Mixtures of branched hydrocarbons especially as isoparaffins form a further particularly preferred form of a useful hydrocarbon solvent of the invention. Particularly useful technical grade mixtures of isoparaffins include mixtures of isoparaffmic organic solvents having a relatively narrow boiling range. Examples of these commercially available isoparaffmic organic solvents include ISOPAR C described to be primarily a mixture of C7-C8 isoparaffins, ISOPAR E described to be primarily a mixture of C8-C9 isoparaffins, ISOPAR G described to be primarily a mixture of C10-C11 isoparaffins, ISOPAR H described to be primarily a mixture of C11-C12 isoparaffins, ISOPAR J, ISOPAR K described to be primarily a mixture of C11-C12 isoparaffins, ISOPAR L described to be primarily a mixture of C11-C13 isoparaffins, ISOPAR M described to be primarily a mixture of C13-C14 isoparaffins, ISOPAR P and ISOPAR V described to be primarily a mixture of C12-C20 isoparaffins.<br>
When present such further processing aids are typically included in amounts of up to about 30% by weight, preferably to 20% wt. of the lavatory treatment composition, although generally lesser amounts are usually effecfive.<br>
Optionally but in some cases, preferably one or more of the foregoing constituents may be provided as an encapsulated, particularly a microencapsulated material. That is to say, quantities of one or more constituents are provided covered or encapsulated in an encapsulating material. Methods suitable for such an encapsulation include the customary methods and also the encapsulation of the granules by a melt consisting e.g. of a water-soluble wax, coacervation, complex coacervation and surface polymerization. Non-limifing examples of useful encapsulating materials include e.g. water-soluble, water-dispersible or water-emulsifiable polymers and waxes.   Advantageously, reactive chemical constituents, particularly the fragrance composition when present, may be provided in an encapsulated form so to ensure that they do not prematurely degrade during processing of the constituents used to form the lavatory treatment composition and that they are retained with minimal degradation in the lavatory treatment composition<br><br>
prior to their use. The use of water soluble encapsulating material is preferred as such will release the one or more chemical constituents when the lavatory treatment composition is contacted with water supplied either in the cistern or in the toilet bowl.<br>
Ideally the lavatory treatment compositions exhibit a density greater than that of water which ensures that they will sink when suspended in a body of water, e.g., the water present within a cistern, pail or other vessel. Preferably the treatment blocks formed from a lavatory treatment composition exhibit a density in excess of about 1 g/cc of water, preferably a density in excess of about 1.5 g/cc of water and most preferably a density of at least about 2 g/cc of water.<br>
While the mass of the lavatory treatment composition s may vary, and amount of up to an including 500 grams may be practiced, generally the mass of the lavatory treatment compositions do not exceed about 150 grams. Advantageously the mass of the lavatory treatment composition s is between about 20 and 100 grams. It is appreciated that lavatory treatment composition s having great mass should provide a longer useful service life of the inventive devices, with the converse being equally true.<br>
The lavatory treatment composition s according to the present invention may also be provided with a coating of a water-soluble film, such as polyvinyl acetate following the formation of the treatment blocks from the recited lavatory treatment composition. Such may be desired for improved handling, however such is often unnecessary as preferred embodiments of the compressed blocks exhibit a lower likelihood of sticking to one another following manufacture than many prior art treatment block compositions.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that several of the components which are directed to provide a chemical composition can be blended into one chemical composition with the additional appreciation that potential blending of incompatible components will be avoided. For example, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that certain anionic surfactants may have to be avoided as some may be incompatible with certain sanitizing agents and/or certain anti-lime scale agents mentioned herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the compatibility of the anionic surfactant and the various sanitizing and anti-limescale agents can be easily determined and thus incompatibility can be avoided in the situations.<br><br>
The lavatory treatment compositions may be formed of a single chemical composition, or may formed of two (or more) different chemical compositions which may be provided as separate regions of a lavatory treatment, such as a first layer of a lavatory treatment consisting of a first chemical composition, alongside a second layer of a the lavatory treatment consisting of a second chemical composition which is different than the first chemical composition. The block may also be formed of two or more separate blocks which are simply layered or otherwise assembled, without or without the use of an adhesive. Further layers of sfill further different chemical compositions may also be present. Such lavatory treatments formed having two or more discrete layers or regions of, respectively, two or more different chemical compositions may be referred to as composite blocks.<br>
Any form of the lavatory treatment composition s may also be provided with a coating film or coating layer, such as a water soluble film which is used to overwrap the chemical composition provided in the device which film provides a vapor barrier when dry, but which dissolves when contacted with water. Alternately the lavatory treatment composition s may be oversprayed or dipped into a bath of a water soluble film forming constituent, and thereafter removed and thus allowing the water soluble film forming constituent to dry and form a coating layer on the lavatory treatment composition .<br>
Exemplary materials which may be used to provide such a coating on some or all of the surfaces of the lavatory treatment compositions include one or more of the following: Rhodasurf TB-970 described by its supplier to be a tridecyl alcohol having a degree of ethoxylation of approximately 100 having an HLB of 19, and exhibiting a melting point in the range of 52-55°C; Antarox F-108 which is described to be an EO-PO block copolymer having a degree of ethoxylation of approximately 80% and having a melting point in the range of 54-60°C; further materials including those idenfified as Pluriol Z8000, and Pluriol E8000 which are believed to be optionally substituted, high molecular weight polyethylene glycols ('TEG") having a sufficiently high molecular weight such that they have a melting point of at least 25'^C, preferably a melting point of at least about 30°C may also be used.   Other water soluble materials, desirably those which have a melting point in the range of about 30 - 70^C, and which may be used to provide a water soluble or water dispersible coating on the lavatory treatment<br><br>
composition s are also contemplated to be useful, especially synthetic or naturally occurring waxy materials, and high molecular weight polyalkylene glycols, especially polyethylene glycols. Certain of these coating materials may be surfactants. Generally such materials may be provided as a dispersion in water, an organic solvent or in an aqueous/organic solvent, but preferably are used as supplied from their respective supplier and are heated to at least their melting points in order to form a liquid bath. Conveniently, the lavatory treatment composition s affixed to the plate of a hanger are then conveniently dipped into the said bath, thereby providing a coating layer to the lavatory treatment composition s. Alternately, the coating materials may be sprayed, brushed on or padded onto at least part of the surfaces of the previously formed lavatory treatment composition s.<br>
The application of a water soluble film or coating is preferred in certain embodiments of the invention as the surface film may facilitate the handling of the blocks during packaging and storage prior to use of the cageless lavatory dispensing devices. Further, the application of a water soluble film or coating is preferred as certain water soluble film former compositions may impart a desirable surface gloss to the compressed lavatory blocks.<br>
Preferably the lavatory treatment compositions useful in the cageless lavatory dispensing devices include those which comprise at least one surfactant, preferably at least one anionic or nonionic surfactant.<br>

Preferred embodiments of the invention are discussed with reference to the accompanying figures.<br>
Figs. 1-3 depict a first embodiment of a packaging dispensing a device according to the first embodiment of the invention.<br>
The combination packaging and dispensing device 10 includes a supporting plate 12 having a top end 14 and a bottom end 16. The top end 14 comprises a plurality of slots, a first pair of'L-shaped" slots 18, 20 defining a first hanger element 21 and second pair of'L-shaped" 22, 24 defining a second hanger element 25. The top part 14 of the supporting plate 12 further includes an optional, but advantageously included stiffening member 26, here an inverted 'U-shaped" channel 26 which is integrally formed with the supporting plate and extends outwardly from one side thereof. As seen in the figure, this<br><br>
stiffening member 26 essentially surrounds a major part of the hanger means, that is to say the first hanger element 21 and the second hanger element 25.<br>
With regard to the first hanger means, as can be seen in the figures, the first hanger means is defined by a first L-shaped slot 18 which breaches and passes through a portion of the supporting plate 12, one end of which terminates in a circular hole 27 the other end 28 of which terminates at a point within the supporting plate. Thus, the first hanger means is an integral part of the supporting plate 12. The first hanger means further includes a second, 'mirror-image" L-shaped slot 20 passing through and breaching the supporting plates 12 which second L-shaped slot also has one end terminating at a hole 29 at one end thereof, the opposite end thereof 30 terminating within the supporting plate 12- As it seems from the figure, the respective ends 28, 30 of the first and second L-shaped slots defining the first hanger means are separated by a small but solid portion of the supporting plates 12. It is to be understood that in use, a consumer can readily press against this portion of the supporting plate 12 between the ends 28, 30 and cause it to break which then allows the first hanger means to swing inwardly and outwardly of plane as generally defined by the supporting plate 12 about the region of the plate defined as a hinge-line HLl which extends between the first hole 27 and the second hole 29. Conveniently, but not necessary, the hinge-line HLl is proximate to the top edge 40 of the supporting plate 12. It is further seen that the porfion of the supporting plate 12 intermediate the holes 27, 29 defining the opposite ends of the hinge-line HLl are not breached or broken, it being understood that the dotted line use to represent the hinge-line HLl do not necessary indicate that perforations exist in this region. Nonetheless it is contemplated that in alternative embodiments, one or more perforations can be provided intermediate holes 27, 29 particularly if the material of the supporting plate 12 is unduly stiff as providing one or more such perforations can improve the flexibility of the first hanger element with respect to the supporting plate and allow it to more readily flex inwardly or outwardly with respect to the supporting plate 12.<br>
Figure 1 also shows a second hanger means defined by a pair of opposed, L-shaped slots passing through the supporting plate 12, a first L-shaped slot 22 opposite of a "mirror-image" second L-shaped slot 25, wherein said perforations are to be understood as extending through, and breaching a part of the supporting plate 12. As it seem<br><br>
thereon, the L-shaped perforations each include top ends, respectively a top end 31 and<br>
33	and bottom ends 32, 34 wherein the bottom ends 32, 34 seem to be in relatively close proximity to one another and are separated by only a small but solid part of the supporting plate 12. Again, as has been discussed above with reference to the first hanger means, it is intended that this small but solid part intermediate the bottom ends 32,<br>
34	can be easily breached by consumer utilizing the device 10 according to the invention. thereby freeing the second hanger means to flex into, or out of the plane defined by the supporting plate 12, and/or alternatively thereto, or out of the plane as generally defined by the hanger elements from which the second hanger elements depends. Such flexure of the second hanger element occurs preferably around a second hanger line HL2 which herein is disclosed for representational purposes as a dotted line. Again, ideally, a series of perforations is not necessarily required between the top ends 31, 33 however, such may be provided if necessary or desired such as if the supporting plate 12 is undesirably stiff Also, while not shown with regard to the second hanger element, one or more holes such as the holes 27, 28 might also be positioned coincidentally with the upper ends 31, 33 of the second hanger element 25 with respect to the first hanger element 21, and/or with respect to the supporting plate 12.<br>
Further, while not shown in the figures it is to be understood of their arrangements and configurations of slots 18, 20, 22, 24 might also be provided. For example, instead of a continuous slot, the arrangements of a slot may be, for example, a series of spaced apart short slots, or holes which are separated by small parts of the solid supporting plate 12 and which are configured such that such small parts of the supporting plate 12 can be readily broken or breached by pushing against the supporting plate 12 in the region of such slots or holes. Such slots or holes, once breached, can be used to define a first, and/or second hanger element which hanger elements can also have a configuration other than the generally U-shaped configurations depicted on Figures 1-6. For example, such further configurafions can be "V" shaped, or "W" shaped, or for that matter can also be simply arcuate curves. It is to be understood that the particular configuration of the hanger elements depicted in the accompanying figures are presented by way of illustration, not by way of limitation. It is also to be understood that a third.<br><br>
fourth still further hanger elements can be used and provided to the device 10 according to the present invention although not specifically disclosed thereon.<br>
Returning now to Figure 1, it is seen that the embodiment depicted provides a block housing 42 which extends outwardly from the supporting plate 12 such that the block housing extends outwardly from an upper face 44 of the supporting plate 12.   In the present embodiment, it is seen that the block housing 42 includes a sidewall 46 which is generally circular in configuration and which terminates at a top flat face 48. The bottom margin 50 of the sidewalls coincident with a generally planar flap 52 which is hinged 54 along the bottom edge 56 of the supporting plate 12 and where portions the flap 52 are coplanar and coincident with the top face 44 of the supporting plate 12 when the device 10 is fully assembled. The block housing 42 defines an interior cavity space 60 which is defined as the volume within the interior of the block housing, and the supporting plate upon which the block housing 42 is mounted. As is depicted in the figure, the block housing also includes a pair of diametrically spaced apart passages 62 and 64 which, as illustrated, pass through a portion of sidewall 46 and the top face 48 of the block housing 42. The top perforafion 60 is proximate to the hanger means and is directed upwardly while the bottom perforation 64 is downwardly directed and is proximate to the bottom margin 56 of the supporfing plate 12 in this configuration. Thus, in such a configuration water or other liquid passing or pouring over the exterior of the block housing 42 which impinges upon the device in the general region of the top part 14 of thereof, and more particularly in the region of the block housing 42 proximate to the top perforation 62, can thus readily pass into the interior cavity 60 where it can contact a lavatory treatment composifion such as in the form of a block or a gel (not shown in the figure) and after coming into contact therewith entraining one or more chemical constituents therefrom in order to form a liquid treatment composition, said liquid treatment composition thus formed can readily flow outwardly fi'om and or downwardly from bottom perforation 64 into a waiting vessel or into a lavatory appliance.<br>
Further illustrated in Figure 1 are a series of removable, flexible covers 70 having at one end thereof a graspable tab region 72. The removable covers 70 are preferably flexible adhesive tapes having an adhesive at least one side thereof and whereby the dimensions of such flexible covers are sufficienfly wide and long to cover the<br><br>
perforations present passing through the block housing 60. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, conveniently two separate pieces of adhesive tape can be easily applied to cover and seal the upper perforation 62 and lower perforation 64 and thus isolate the contents of the block housing from the ambient environment. Thus, the device according to the invention provides a convenient packaging means for storing, displaying, and providing a package for the lavatory treatment composition contained within the block housing 42. Yet, upon use, a consumer can easily remove the removable covers, i.e., the tape 70 thereby exposing the passages 62, 64 as well as exposing the contents of the block housing 42, namely the lavatory treatment composition to contact with water which can now pass into, and out of, said block housing 42.<br>
Figure 2 depicts and elevational and frontal view of the combination packaging and dispensing device described with reference to Figure 1. More clearly illustrated is the hinge 54 which is coincident with bottom margin 56 if the supporting plate 12. the relationship and the dimensions of the first hanger means 21 with the second hanger means 25, the placement of the optional, but desirably included stiffening member 26 with respect to the supporting plate 12 and in particular with respect to the top margin 40, right margin 7 and left margin 72 of the supporting plate 12, as well as the general configuration of the now unobscured upper perforation 62 and lower perforation 64 of the block housing 42.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the embodiments of Figures 1 and 2 in a side view, which again advantageously depicts the relationship between the first hanger element 21, second hanger element 25, stiffening element 26, and the block housing 42 with respect to the supporting plate 12. Such also illustrates that prior to being breached, broken, or flexed the first hanger means, and one present, the second hanger means are desirably coincident with, a co-planer with the plane defined by supporting plate 12.<br>
Figures 4-6 depict the embodiment of the combined packaging dispensing device 10 as depicted in Figures 1-3 albeit in an unfolded configuration. As seem thereon as illustrated in both Figures 4 and Figures 5 the device 10 can be unfolded around the hinge 54, thereby exposing the interior of the cavity 60 so that a suitably dimensioned lavatory block, paste or gel composition can be inserted into said cavity 60, and thereafter the block housing 42 which depends from the flap 52 can be rotated about the hinge 54 and<br><br>
thereby seating and sealing the frontward face 11 of the supporting plate 12.   As is best understood from Figures 4-5 therein is visible the rearward face 13 of the supporting plate 12 and the front face of the flap 52 and the block housing 48 which, when the device is formed into its final configuration, said flap 52 and block housing 42 extend outwardly from the front face 11 of the supporting plate 12.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a side elevational view of the embodiments of the device 10 as illustrated on Figures 4 and 5 for better understanding of this relationship between the various elements.<br>
Figures 7-10 illustrate in various views a second embodiment of a combination packaging and dispensing device 10 according to the present invention. As can be seen thereon, many elements present in the embodiment according to Figures 7-10 also present in the embodiment depicted and discussed with references 1-6 and the description of such common elements, and their features will not be repeated here but are understood to be equally applicable as if incorporated by reference.<br>
With reference now to Figure 7 there is depicted the second preferred embodiment of a combined packaging and dispensing device 10 according to the present invention, which includes a hanger means comprising a first hanger element 21 and a second hanger element 25, and also a block housing 46 which extends outwardly from the plane defined by the supporting plate 12.   As is illustrated thereon, the block housing 42 which extends outwardly from the front face 11 of the supporting plate 12. The block housing 42 includes a generally circular sidewall 46 which terminates at a top end 48. The block sidewall 46 includes a plurality of passages passing there through here are top passages 60-1, 60-2, and 60-3 all of which extend through the sidewall 46 and thereto exposing the lavatory treatment block 80 to the ambient environment. As seen in Figure 7, a portion of the lavatory treatment block 80 is visible through said perforations.   It is also to be understood with reference to Figure 7, that the perforations 60-1, 60-2, 60-3 may be considered as 'upper" or "inlet" perforations as they are positioned relatively proximate to the hanger means and further, they are also diametrically opposed, that is to say about 180 degrees of angle away from a further series of perforations which are distally located with respect to thereto and although not visible on Figure 7, are discussed with reference to Figure 10 as well as being depicted thereon. As further seen from<br><br>
Figure 7. the block housing 42 has a margin 50 which is coincident with, terminates at a recess 65 which also extends outwardly from the plane of the supporting plate 12 in the direction of the block housing 42. The function of this recess 65 is that of providing both a short platform for the block housing 42 and concurrently to also provide a generally squared shaped cavity whereby a sealing plate can be applied within said recess 65 from the rearward face 13 of the supporting plate 12 such a sealing plate 66 being adapted to form a physically seal, preferably a liquid-tight sea! with the margin 50, or other part of the block housing 42. In this manner, in a conventional production process a pre-formed supporting plate having the configuration according to Figure 7 can be produced, subsequently a suitably dimensioned lavatory treatment composition, e.g, a solid block or a gel composition can be inserted into the cavity of the block housing 42, and thereafter the sealing plate 66 can be inserted into the cavity 65 as subsequently sealed by any suitable means, thereby sealing the treatment block composition 80 within the interior of the block housing 42.<br>
Returning now to Figure 7 briefly, there is also visible therefrom a flexible sealing member 70 which is used to seal the perforation 60-1, 60-2, and 60-3 from the ambient environment, and desirably as illustrated having at one end thereof a graspable tab 72 which can be readily used to separate the flexible sealing member 70 from the sidewall 46 of the block housing 42. Again, such is conveniently provided by a piece of flexible tape having an adhesive exposed on at least part of one sided thereof. The tab 72 provides a convenient way whereby consumer can conveniently grasped and removes the flexible sealing members 70 and remove the flexible sealing member 70 from the device 10. It is to be understood that while the presence of a tab 72 is advantageous, it is not necessarily present in certain embodiments of the invention.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates top view of the lower part 14 of the device according to the invention and particular illustrates the relationship of the flexible sealing means 70 with the perforations 60-1, 60-2 and 60-3. As it seems thereon, the placement of the flexible ceiling means 70 obscures the said perforations, which in turns also acts to isolate the lavatory cleansing block, gel, composition 80 contained within cavity of the block housing 42.<br><br>
1     I<br>
Turning now to Figure 10, there is depicted a bottom, plan view of the combination packaging and dispensing device 10 according to the invention as depicted in Figure 7 through Figure 9. As is visible therefrom, the sidewall 46 of the block housing 42 comprises a series of spaced apart circular shaped perforations 64-1, 64-2, and 64-3 which be essentially diametrically opposed to the upper perforation 60-1, 60-2 and 60-3 and also as being downwardly directed, are useful in providing 'drain' holes for water, and/or liquid treatment composition exiting the interior of the block housing 42. Similarly as depicted with regard to Figure 7 and Figure 9. These perforations 64-1, 64-2 and 64-3 are similarly obscured by a sealing member 70 which again, can conveniently can be a piece of adhesive tape which is used to seal said perforations and thereby isolate the contents of the block housing 42 from the ambient environment prior to the installation of and use of the device according to the invention.<br>
A method of using the device according the invention is described with reference to Fig. 11. Thereon, as it is seen the combination packaging and dispensing device 10 is configured to be suspended upon a portion of a pail, whereby the first hanger means 21 is tlexed outwardly from the plane of the supporting plate in a direction away from the block housing 42 such that it overlaps the rim of the pail thereby suspending the device 10. The second hanger means provided 25 is flexed in the opposite direction, that is to say in the direction towards the block housing 42 and the supporting plate 12 whereby a portion or edge of the second hanger means 25 engages and is positioned in an interference type. In this way a supply of a liquid treatment composition may be formed by pouring water or other liquid over the said device 10 where it can contact a lavatory treatment composition such as in the form of a block or a gel and after coming into contact therewith entraining one or more chemical constituents therefrom in order to form a liquid treatment composition. The liquid treatment composition may be retained in the pail from which it can be directly dispensed, e.g., poured into a lavatory appliance or other lavatory surface.<br>
In a further method of using the device, while not shown it is to be understood that the hanger means of the device may be suspended on a part of a lavatory appliance, e.g., a toilet, bidet, urinal or other lavatory appliance such that the lavatory treatment composition contained within the block housing is in the path of flush water such as is<br><br>
found in a toilet bowl during a flush cycle, or other flowing water, such as water used to refill or replenish a tank or cistern between flush cycles, such that water comes into at least intermittent contact with a lavatory treatment composition such as in the form of a block or a gel and after coming into contact therewith entraining one or more chemical constituents therefrom in order to form a liquid treatment composition which may be used to treat the lavatory appliance.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention, including certain particularly preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the following examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Several different lavatory treatment compositions in the form of a compressed blocks were tested. Each of the said lavatory treatment compositions was formed by either a conventional extrusion process, or by a stamping process to form the blocks.<br>
The following example block compositions were tested:<br><br><br><br>
Each of the blocks were tested by separately placing a 30 gram sample of each of the block compositions into a block housing of a combination packaging and dispensing device having a configuration as depicted on Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10.   With reference to Figures 7 and 9, the block housing included three openings having dimensions of 1/8 inch by VA inch. With reference to Figures 8 and 10, the block housing had linear circular holes having 1/8 inch diameters. The combination packaging and dispensing device containing a sample block was suspended generally as shown on Fig. 11 in a testing jig, wherein the said device was suspended adjacent to the sidewall of a polyolefm jug, whereby a supply of water would impinge of the said device, and pass into and out of the block housing within which it would contact a block composition. The water was supplied intermittently via a tube which would supply 2.3 liters of water per application within a timespan of between 40 - 120 seconds, and between applications no water was supplied thereby permitting the sample block to at least partially dry. The period between applications of water was at least 30 minutes. All of the tested sample blocks were subjected to the same text cycle and pattern of water supply.<br>
Each of the tested sample blocks provided good foaming and a good service life, lasting between 95-105 water application cycles.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
