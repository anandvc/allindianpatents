				<td>The present invention relates to a new coated steel<br>
strip material with a very hard and dense coating. It also<br>
relates to a method of manufacturing sucn a coated steel<br>
strip in a continuous roll-to-roll process which results in<br>
a very good adhesion of a hard and dense coating on a metal<br>
strip substrate. In particular, it relates to coated steel<br>
strips, which have such a good adhesion of the hard coating<br>
that they are suitable for use in coater and doctor blade<br>
applications.<br>
Background to the invention and prior Art<br>
Doctor and coater blades are used in the manufacturing<br>
of paper and in the printing industry, in order to scrape<br>
paper and printing ink, respectively, from a rotating roll.<br>
In connection to this, problems often arise with wear on<br>
the roll and on the coater or doctor blade. Coater and<br>
doctor blades are normally manufactured from hardened steel<br>
strips. One common way of reducing the wear problem is to<br>
apply an abrasion resistant coating to the steel blade<br>
after it has been manufactured to its final geometry in the<br>
form of a coater or doctor blade. In connection to this,<br>
usually a nickel layer must be applied to act as a bond-<br>
coat between the substrate and the abrasion resistant<br>
coating.<br>
Thus, it is known that abrasion resistant coatings can<br>
be used, but there are difficulties to find a cost-<br>
efficient and environmentally friendly method that can meet<br>
the required quality. The cost for a coater or doctor blade<br>
with an applied abrasion resistant coating is at present<br>
very high. Moreover, the cost for a quality problem<br>
occurring during usage in a printing industry or in a paper<br>
mill is high. For cost reasons, a continuous roll-to-roll<br>
coating process, preferably integrated in the production of<br>
the steel strip, is therefore required. Further, for<br>
quality reasons, a dense coating with very good adhesion to<br>
the substrate is of advantage. Prom a cost perspective, it<br>
is also a rurtner advantage xr there is such a good<br>
adhesion of the abrasion resistant coating that there is no<br>
need of any separate bond-coat.<br>
The good adhesion of a dense coating is needed for the<br>
functional quality of the finished coater or doctor blade.<br>
A poor adhesion, or a porous or coarse coating, would cause<br>
problems during usage of the coater blade or doctor blade,<br>
e.g., that the coating starts to flake off, or that grains<br>
or small pieces are torn off, or that fissure problems<br>
occur. All in all, this is not acceptable from a quality<br>
and cost perspective, since this type of problem with a<br>
doctor blade would result in bad printing quality, or that<br>
many frequent stops would be needed in the paper mill, to<br>
replace bad coater blades. In a process industry such as a<br>
paper mill, each stop is very costly and must be avoided.<br>
There are several common methods of making a coating<br>
and also several different types of coatings that are being<br>
used. As examples can be mentioned:<br>
¦ Ceramic coatings, often consisting of Al2O3 with possible<br>
additions of TiO2 and/or ZrO2. This type of coating is<br>
normally applied by using a thermal spray method and an<br>
example of this method is described in, e.g., US-A-6 431<br>
066, in which a ceramic coating is applied along one<br>
edge of a doctor blade. Another example of a method is<br>
described in EP-B-758 026, in which a wear resistant<br>
coating is applied along one edge using several coating<br>
steps in a rather complicated continuous process<br>
including thermal spray. Thermal spray methods have<br>
normally some major drawbacks. The formed coating is<br>
rough which means that polishing or other further<br>
processing must usually be done to the surface after the<br>
coating. A thermal spray coating also usually includes a<br>
high degree of porosity, implying that a thin dense<br>
coating normally can not be achieved. Furthermore, the<br>
thickness of thermal sprayed coatings is normally rather<br>
high. In the case of coater and doctor blades, the<br>
thickness of a ceramic coating is often in the range of<br>
20-100 µm. During usage, a thick and coarse coating has<br>
an increased risk of fissure formation or that grains<br>
tear off from the surface. In many cases expensive<br>
nickel or nickel alloys must also be used as a bond-coat<br>
in order to improve the adhesion of the ceramic coating.<br>
Metallic coatings, often consisting of pure nickel or<br>
chromium, or in the form of a compound such as nickel-<br>
phosphorus. These types of metallic coatings are<br>
normally applied by using a plating method, and<br>
especially electrolytic plating. Electrolytic plating<br>
methods have some drawbacks, one major being the<br>
difficulty to obtain an even thickness and also that the<br>
adhesion of the layer can be poor. Also, plating<br>
processes are not environmentally friendly, on the<br>
contrary, these processes are often causing<br>
environmental problems.<br>
Combinations of coatings, such as a nickel coating<br>
comprising abrasion resistant particles, e.g., SiC. One<br>
example of this method is described in WO 02/46526, in<br>
which different layers are applied in a continuous<br>
process for electrolytic nickel coatings in several<br>
steps and by adding abrasive particles to at least one<br>
of these steps. This method also has some drawbacks, in<br>
principle the same drawbacks as for electrolytic plating<br>
as described above, but also that nickel is used to a<br>
large extent as a bond-coat, meaning that the coating is<br>
very expensive.<br>
Thus, the methods as described in the examples above can<br>
not be used for the present invention.<br>
Therefore, it is a primary object of the present<br>
invention to provide a hard and abrasion resistant coated<br>
metal strip with improved adhesion between a dense coating<br>
and the substrate.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to obtain a<br>
cost-efficient coating in a continuous roll-to-roll process<br>
integrated in the production of a steel strip.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a coated steel strip product with a dense layer of<br>
an abrasion resistant coating, so as to enable the<br>
manufacturing of coater and doctor blades of said material.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method to manufacture a doctor or coater blade<br>
directly in connection to a continuous coating in a roll-<br>
to-roll process included in a strip production line,<br>
without any need of further manufacturing steps in a<br>
separate blade manufacturing.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to obtain a<br>
coating with a thickness as uniform as possible.<br>
These and other objects have been surprisingly attained<br>
by providing a coated steel product according to claim 1.<br>
Further preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>

strip according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic cross-section of a metal<br>
strip according to a second embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically a production line for the<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The final product, in the form of a hardenable strip<br>
steel with a coating of a dense and hard abrasion resistant<br>
coating, is suitable in doctor and coater blade<br>
applications, such as doctor blades for rotogravure or<br>
flexogravure printing, or coater blades for scraping paper<br>
in the manufacturing of paper, or creping blades for use in<br>
creping of paper in the manufacturing of paper. These are<br>
all applications in which wear often arise on the blades,<br>
wear originating from the contact with the rolls or wear<br>
coming from the paper, which contains abrasive minerals. A<br>
suitable coating has a dense layer of an abrasion resistant<br>
coating with good adhesion, which is hard but also tough<br>
enough to withstand the work-load and pressure during<br>
usage, without showing any tendency to brittleness or<br>
tearing off.<br>
To prevent the end product from wear, it is suitable<br>
to have the product coated with at least one layer of<br>
abrasion resistant coating. Both one-sided and two-sided<br>
coatings can be used. One-sided coatings is preferable from<br>
a cost perspective and should be used whenever possible,<br>
and especially in the doctor blade application for use in<br>
flexogravure printing, the one-sided coating will normally<br>
stand the lifetime needed. For blade applications used in<br>
more severe conditions, or during longer running times,<br>
two-sided coatings may be preferable. Otherwise, problems<br>
may occur with, e.g., plastic deformation along the edge on<br>
the uncoated side, or that there is a material build-up<br>
along the edge of the uncoated side, which occasionally may<br>
be ripped off from a spot, causing material to locally be<br>
torn away from the edge of the coater blade.<br>
The method described in the present invention is<br>
suitable for thin coatings of hard and dense abrasion<br>
resistant layers in thicknesses on each side up to 25 µm in<br>
total, normally up to 20µm in total, preferably up to 15 µm<br>
in total, or at the best maximum 12 µm or even maximum 10 µm<br>
in total, is preferable from a cost perspective. If<br>
thicker coatings are to be coated, an optimum in cost<br>
versus properties may be achieved by using multi-layers<br>
with up to 10 layers, and where each layer is between 0,1<br>
to 15 µm thick, suitably between 0,1 to 10 µm, or more<br>
suitably 0,1 to 7 µm, preferably 0,1 to 5 µm and even more<br>
preferably 0,1 to 3 µm.<br>
The coating is performed at a rate of minimum 2,5<br>
meters per minute, preferably min 5 m/min, most preferably<br>
min 10 m/min.<br>
The coating should be sufficiently wear-resistant in<br>
order to withstand the wear and shear exerted by the<br>
treated material, on the other hand it should not be too<br>
thick, due to economical reasons and fragility/brittleness.<br>
For coater blade and doctor blade applications, the ratio<br>
between the thickness of the coating and the substrate<br>
material should be between 0,1% to 12%, normally 0,1 to 10%<br>
and usually 0,1 to 7,5% but most preferably between 0,1-5%.<br>
The abrasion resistance can be achieved by depositing<br>
at least one layer of dense oxide coating in the form of<br>
Al2O3, TiO2 or ZrO2. or mixtures of these oxides, preferably<br>
Al2O3 -based. Depending on the requirements, an optimum of<br>
required hardness and toughness can be achieved by using<br>
mixed oxides in the coating. This can be achieved by co-<br>
evaporation of aluminum oxide and another selected oxide.<br>
Preferably it can be a co-evaporation of aluminum oxide and<br>
any other oxide, preferably TiO2 and/or ZrO2. Multi-layers<br>
may also be used in order to enable a combination of oxides<br>
so as to optimize hardness and toughness by having up to 10<br>
layers with different oxides in the layers.<br>
In variation to the above-described abrasion resistant<br>
coating consisting of essentially oxides, also other dense<br>
and hard coatings such as metallic coatings can be used in<br>
the present invention. Hard metallic coatings such as<br>
essentially pure Cr may be used if a simple and cheap<br>
coating is to be preferred in order to reduce cost as much<br>
as possible.<br>
Yet another variation of the present invention is to<br>
use layers/coatings of transition metal carbides and/or<br>
nitrides, such as e.g. TiN, TiC or CrN, also in some cases<br>
in combination with an oxide in the form of Al2O3, TiO2 or<br>
ZrO2, or mixtures of these oxides, preferably Al2O3 -based.<br>
By using the multi-layer system with up to 10 layers, a<br>
coating existing of a combination of several layers of<br>
different oxides and nitrides can even further enhance the<br>
optimum of desired hardness and toughness.<br>
In order to withstand the wear and shear forces on a<br>
coater or a doctor blade, the hardness of the thin coating<br>
should be above 600 HV, more suitably above 700 HV,<br>
preferably above 800 HV and most preferably above 900 HV.<br>
The tolerances of each layer is maximum + /- 10% of<br>
the layer thickness at strip widths up to 400 mm. This<br>
means that very tight tolerances can be achieved, which is<br>
of benefit for the precision during usage and the quality<br>
of the product. In comparison to plating or thermal spray<br>
this represents much higher tolerances. For instance, in<br>
plating there is a so called dog-bone effect, which results<br>
in varying thicknesses of the layer. In that case, the<br>
layer usually varies more than +/- 50% of the layer<br>
thickness.<br>
There is no need of any separate bond-coat, but nickel<br>
may still be used in one of the layers if it is required<br>
from a technical perspective, e.g., to enhance toughness.<br>
Since nickel is expensive it is usually used in very thin<br>
layers only, suitably between 0 to 2 µm, preferably between<br>
0-1 µm and most preferably between 0-0,5 µm. However, any<br>
possible nickel layer would not be the layer adjacent to<br>
the substrate.<br>
Description of the substrate material to be coated<br>
The material to be coated should have a good basic<br>
mechanical strength, suitable for a coater or doctor blade<br>
application. Preferably, it should be a hardenable steel in<br>
a hardened and tempered condition, or alternatively a<br>
precipitation hardenable steel, such as the alloy disclosed<br>
in WO 93/07303, which in the end condition can achieve a<br>
tensile strength level above 1200 MPa, or preferably more<br>
than 1300 MPa, or at the best above 1400 MPa, or even 1500<br>
MPa. If the coater or doctor blade is intended for use in a<br>
corrosive environment, then the steel alloy should also<br>
have a sufficient addition of chromium to enable a good<br>
basic corrosion resistance. The Cr content should in this<br>
case be above 10% by weight, or at least 11%, or preferably<br>
a minimum of 12%.<br>
The coating method may be applied on any kind of<br>
product made of said type of steel alloy and in the form of<br>
a strip that has good hot workability and also can be cold-<br>
rolled to thin dimensions. The alloy should also be capable<br>
of readily being manufactured to coater or doctor blade<br>
applications in a manufacturing process including steps<br>
such as forming, grinding, shaving, cutting, polishing,<br>
stamping, or the like. The thickness of the strip substrate<br>
material is usually between 0,015 mm to 5,0 mm and suitably<br>
between 0,03 mm to 3 mm. Preferably, it is between 0,03 to<br>
2 mm, and even more preferably between 0,03 to 1,5 mm. The<br>
width of the substrate material depends on if the coating<br>
is made before or after the slitting operation. Further,<br>
said width should preferably be selected to be a width<br>
suitable for further manufacturing to the final width of<br>
the coater or doctor blade. In principle, the width of the<br>
substrate material is therefore between 1 to 1500 mm,<br>
suitably 1 to 1000 mm, or preferably 1 to 500 mm, or even<br>
more preferably between 5 and 500 mm. The length of the<br>
substrate material is suitably between 10 and 20 000 m,<br>
preferably between 100 and 20 000 m.<br>
Description of the Coating Method<br>
A variety of physical or chemical vaporation<br>
deposition methods for the application of the coating media<br>
and the coating process may be used as long as they provide<br>
a continuous uniform and adherent layer. As exemplary of<br>
deposition methods can be mentioned chemical vapor<br>
deposition (CVD), metal organic chemical vapor deposition<br>
(MOCVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD) such as sputtering<br>
and evaporation by resistive heating, by electron beam, by<br>
induction, by arc resistance or by laser deposition<br>
methods, but for the present invention especially electron<br>
beam evaporation (EB) is preferred for the deposition.<br>
Optionally, the EB evaporation can be plasma activated to<br>
even further ensure good quality coatings of hard and dense<br>
layers.<br>
For the present invention, it is a pre-requisite that the<br>
coating method is integrated in a roll-to-roll strip<br>
production line. The hard coating is then deposited by<br>
means of electron beam evaporation (EB) in a roll-to-roll<br>
process. If multi layers are needed, the formation of them<br>
can be achieved by integrating several EB deposition<br>
chambers in-line. The deposition of metallic coatings<br>
should be made under reduced atmosphere at a maximum<br>
pressure of 1 x 10"2 mbar with no addition of any reactive<br>
gas to ensure essentially pure metal films. The deposition<br>
of metal oxides should be performed under reduced pressure<br>
with an addition of an oxygen source as reactive gas in the<br>
chamber. A partial pressure of oxygen should be in the<br>
range 1 - 100 x 10-4 mbar. If other types of coatings are<br>
to be achieved, e.g., transition metal carbides and/or<br>
nitrides such as TiN, TiC or CrN, or mixtures thereof with,<br>
e.g., metal oxides, the conditions during the coating<br>
should be adjusted with regard to the partial pressure of a<br>
reactive gas so as to enable the formation of the intended<br>
compound. In the case of oxygen a reactive gas such as H2O,<br>
O2 or O3, but preferably 02, may be used. In the case of<br>
nitrogen a reactive gas such as N2/ NH3 or N2H4, but<br>
preferably N2, may be used. In the case of carbon, any<br>
carbon containing gas may be used as reactive gas, for an<br>
example CH4, C2H2 or C2H4. All these reactive EB evaporation<br>
processes may be plasma activated.<br>
To enable a good adhesion, different types of cleaning<br>
steps are used. First of all, the surface of the substrate<br>
material should be cleaned in a proper way to remove all<br>
oil residues, which otherwise may negatively affect the<br>
efficiency of the coating process and the adhesion and<br>
quality of the coating. Moreover, the very thin native<br>
oxide layer that normally always is present on a steel<br>
surface must be removed. This can preferably be done by<br>
including a pre-treatment of the surface before the<br>
deposition of the coating. In this roll-to-roll production<br>
line, the first production step is therefore preferably an<br>
ion assisted etching of the metallic strip surface to<br>
achieve good adhesion of the first coating [see Fig. 3].<br>
Description of embodiments of the invention<br>
Two examples of embodiments of the invention will now<br>
be described in more details. The first example {Figure 1)<br>
comprises a coating 1,2 for a substrate material 3 in full<br><br>
strip width. The substrate material can be made of<br>
different alloys, such as a hardenable carbon steel or a<br>
hardenable stainless chromium steel. The other example<br>
(Figure 2) comprises a coating 4 of a steel strip 5, which<br>
before the coating process, has been both slitted and edge<br>
treated to a width in principle twice the final width of<br>
the coater blade. During coating, both the main sides 7,8<br>
and the narrow lateral sides 9,10 are coated, thereby-<br>
obtaining a complete coating around the scraping or cutting<br>
edges 11,12. Suitably, the lateral sides 9 and 10 are<br>
coated simulateneously with the somewhat narrower main side<br>
7. The examples given are only intended as illustrative<br>
examples to the invention and may not serve as a limitation<br>
to the present innovation.<br>
The substrate material should have a composition<br>
suitable for hardening, which means:<br>
- Hardenable carbon steel of 0,1-1,5% C, 0,001-4% Cr,<br>
0,01-1,5% Mn, 0,01-1,5% Si, up to 1% Ni, 0,001-0,5%N, rest<br>
essentially Fe; or<br>
- Hardenable chromium steels of 0,1-1,5% C, 10-16% Cr,<br>
0,001-1% Ni, 0,01-1,5% Mn, 0,01-1,5% Si, up to 3% Mo,<br>
0,001-0,5% N, rest essentially Fe; or<br>
- Precipitation hardenable steels of: 0,001-0,3% C, 10-16%<br>
Cr, 4-12% Ni, 0,1-1,5% Ti, 0,01-1,0% Al, 0,01-6% Mo, 0,001-<br>
4% Cu, 0,001-0,3% N, 0,01-1,5% Mn, 0,01-1,5% Si, rest<br>
essentially Fe.<br>
Example 1<br>
The chemical compositions of the substrate materials<br>
in the example are according to the internal Sandvik<br>
designation 20C2 and 13C26, with essentially the following<br>
nominal composition:<br>
Sandvik 20C2: 1,0% C, 1,4% Cr, 0,3% Si and 0,3% Mn (by<br>
weight)/ and<br><br>
Sandvik 13C26: 0,7% C, 13% Cr, 0,4% Si and 0,7% Mn (by<br>
weight).<br>
Firstly, the substrate materials are produced by<br>
ordinary metallurgical steelmaking to a chemical<br>
composition as described above. After this, they are hot-<br>
rolled down to an intermediate size, and thereafter cold-<br>
rolled in several steps with a number of recrystallization<br>
steps between said rolling steps, until a final thickness<br>
of 0,2 mm and a width of maximally 400 mm. Thereafter the<br>
strip steels are hardened and tempered to the required<br>
mechanical strength level, which according to the present<br>
invention should be at least 1200 MPa. The surface of the<br>
substrate material is then cleaned in a proper way to<br>
remove oil residuals from the rolling and hardening<br>
operations. Thereafter, the coating process takes place in<br>
a continuous process line, starting with decoiling<br>
equipment. The first step in the roll-to-roll process line<br>
can be a vacuum chamber or an entrance vacuum lock followed<br>
by an etch chamber, in which ion assisted etching takes<br>
place in order to remove the thin oxide layer on the<br>
substrate material. The strip then enters into the EB<br>
evaporation chamber(s) in which deposition of an oxide<br>
takes place, in this example Al2O3 is selected as the<br>
material to be deposited. An oxide layer of normally 0,1 up<br>
to 25 µm is deposited; the preferred thickness depends on<br>
the application. In the examples described here, a<br>
thickness of 2 µm is deposited by using one EB evaporation<br>
chamber. After the EB evaporation, the coated strip<br>
material passes through the exit vacuum chamber or exit<br>
vacuum lock before it is being coiled on to a coiler. The<br>
coated strip material can now, if needed, be further<br>
processed by for an example slitting and edge treatment, to<br>
obtain the preferred final dimension and edge condition for<br>
the manufacturing of a coater blade. It is an advantage if<br><br>
an additional coating along the edge of the finished coater<br>
blade application can be made in a continuous coating<br>
process using EB evaporation, but also other processes may-<br>
be used. Preferably, an additional coating along the edge<br>
of a finished blade is of same type as the coating applied<br>
on the strip material according to the present invention.<br>
The end product as described in this examples, i.e. a<br>
coated 20C2 and 13C26-strip material respectively, in a<br>
strip thickness of 0,2 mm and with a thin coating of Al2O3<br>
of 2 µm, has a very good adhesion of the coated layer and<br>
is thus suitable to use especially for the manufacturing of<br>
doctor blades for flexogravure or rotogravure printing.<br>
The roll-to-roll electron beam evaporation process<br>
referred to above is illustrated in Figure 3. The first<br>
part of such a production line is the uncoiler 13 within a<br>
vacuum chamber 14, then the in-line ion assisted etching<br>
chamber 15, followed by a series of EB evaporation chambers<br>
16, the number of EB evaporation chambers needed can vary<br>
from 1 up to 10 chambers, this to achieve a multi-layered<br>
structure, if so desired. All the EB evaporation chambers<br>
16 are equipped with EB guns 17 and water-cooled copper<br>
crucibles 18 for the evaporation. After these chambers<br>
comes the exit vacuum chamber 19 and the recoiler 20 for<br>
the coated strip material, the recoiler being located<br>
within vacuum chamber 19. The vacuum chambers 14 and 19 may<br>
also be replaced by an entrance vacuum lock system and an<br>
exit vacuum lock system, respectively. In the latter case,<br>
the uncoiler 13 and the coiler 20 are placed in the open<br>
air.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The chemical composition of the substrate material in this<br>
example is according to the internal Sandvik designation<br>
20C with essentially the following nominal composition:<br>
Sandvik 20C: 1,0% C, 0,2% Cr, 0,3% Si and 0,4% Mn (by-<br>
weight) .<br>
Firstly, the substrate material is produced by<br>
ordinary metallurgical steelmaking to a chemical<br>
composition as described above. The material is then hot-<br>
rolled down to an intermediate size, and thereafter cold-<br>
rolled in several steps with a number of recrystallization<br>
steps between said rolling steps, until a final thickness<br>
of 0,45 mm and a width of maximum 400 mm are attained.<br>
Thereafter, the steel strip is hardened and tempered to the<br>
required mechanical strength level, according to the<br>
present invention above 1200 MPa. The strip is afterwards<br>
slitted to a width corresponding to substantially twice the<br>
width of the final blade application. According to this<br>
example, the final coater blade width is 100 mm and the<br>
strip is thus slitted to a width of between 200-250 mm.<br>
The edges along the slitted strip are then edge-treated,<br>
for example shaved, ground and polished, to the conditions<br>
and geometry considered suitable for the intended coater<br>
blade application. After this, the strip is submitted to a<br>
coating treatment fully analogous to Example 1, cf. also<br>
Figure 3. The end product will be a coated strip according<br>
to Figure 2, the coating material and thickness being the<br>
same as in Example 1. Now, the coated strip material can be<br>
slitted in the middle along section 6 to obtain two coated<br>
strips, each with the dimension and edge geometry suitable<br>
for a finished coater blade. In principle, only cutting<br>
into required final length remains.<br>
The end product as described in this example, i.e. a<br>
slitted, edge treated and coated strip material, in a strip<br>
thickness of 0,45 mm and a final slitted width of 100 mm,<br><br>
has a thin covering aluminum oxide coating of 2 µm with a<br>
very good adhesion of the coated layer. This product can be<br>
cut into required length, normally in between 3-10 m, and<br>
then used as a coater blade in a paper mill, without any<br>
further processing. It may also, if required, be further<br>
processed, e.g., with an additional edge treatment or with<br>
additional coatings along the edge, or polishing or the<br>
like, in order to meet a specific customer demand., An<br>
additional coating along the edge of the finished coater<br>
blade application, can preferably be made in a continuous<br>
coating process using EB evaporation, but also other<br>
processes may be used.<br><br>
