				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2-HYDROXY CARBOXYLIC ACIDS<br>
Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids. Particularly the present invention relates to a process wherein an enol ester and a hydroxyl compound react with carbon monoxide in presence of a palladium catalyst, containing one or more ligands having one or more coordinating N, O and/ or P atoms and a solvent at a temperature and a pressure, to produce 2-acetoxy ester and/ or 2-hydroxy ester of corresponding carboxylic acid, of the corresponding carboxylic acid which on further catalytic hydrolysis produce 2-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The process has potential importance when applied to vinyl acetate. In a preferred embodiment vinyl acetate reacts with a hydroxyl compound and carbon monoxide to give 2-acetoxy propionic acid or 2-acetoxy propionate ester and/ or lactate ester, which can be converted to lactic acid on hydrolysis. Lactic acid is important commercially in baking industry, cheese industry, in dying wool, to make plasticisers for resin, etc. <br>
Background and prior art references of the present Application Lactic acid has been produced industrially by fermentation of molasses, but the process is costly and inefficient, and produces large amount of byproducts, making product separation and purification expensive. Another commercial rout for lactic acid is hydrocyanation of acetaldehyde followed by hydrolysis of cyanohydrin with H2SO4. This rout is highly corrosive, consumes stoichometric amount of toxic HCN and H2SO4. Further the process uses expensive HCN and produces stoichometric amount of (NH4)SO4<br>
Alkoxycarbonylation of certain aceloxyolefinic compounds is reported in US patents 4,257,973 and 3,857,319. German patent 1,221,224 and Swiss patent 589,571 disclose carbonylation of alcohols or phenols with CO and olefins. However neither patent discloses the alkoxycarbonylation of enol acylates with CO and hydroxyl compound. US patent 4,072,709 provides a process for the production of lactic acid in which, alpha-aceloxy-propanaldehyde formed by hydroformylation of vinyl acetate is oxidized to alpha-aceloxy-propionic acid, which is further hydrolysed to lactic acid. However, the process involves three steps for the formation of lactic acid. US patent 4,377,708 provides a process for hydrocarbonylation of vinyl acetate using CO and water as reactants with vinyl acetate. In the process, special precautions are taken for<br><br>
the stability of the catalyst, reactants and products. The process needs to maintain the<br>
concentration of water not more than 3 weight percent of the medium, so as to avoid<br>
hydrolysis of reactant vinyl acetate to acetic acid and acetaldehyde. European patent<br>
0144188 provides a process for alkoxycarbonylation of enol esters with hydroxyl<br>
compounds using Pd, Rh and Ni catalysts and further hydrolysis of the products to<br>
hydroxy acids. However, the process operates at low concentration of hydroxyl<br>
compound (
separation method  and reuse,  showing inefficiency of the catalyst.  Palladium<br>
catalysed hydrocarbonylation of enol esters have been reported in Bull Chem. Soc.<br>
Jpn. 69, 1337-1345 (1996). However, the process needs high pressure of CO (150-250<br>
atm.) and a base such as pyridine or its derivatives. Furthermore, loading of the<br>
catalyst is high (5 mol% of enol ester) which gives less activity in terms of turn over<br>
number. Also the process is applicable only for acetoxy esters and hydroxy esters, and<br>
not for the important product like hydroxy acids such as lactic acid.<br>
As can be seen, the pri9r art processes suffer from several disadvantages such as use<br>
of costly and toxic chemicals, formation of large amount of byproducts, low catalyst<br>
activity, and catalyst and reactant stability. It is therefore necessary to develop a<br>
process  for preparation of 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids,  which  overcomes the<br>
drawbacks enumerated above.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
2-hydroxy carboxylic acids, which overcomes the drawbacks of low activity, catalyst<br>
stability, use of toxic chemicals, and the severe operating conditions.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an efficient catalytic process for the<br>
preparation of 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids via carbonylation of enol ester and<br>
subsequent hydrolysis of ester of the corresponding 2-acetoxy carboxylic acid and/ or<br>
ester of the corresponding 2-hydroxy carboxylic acid that operates at milder reaction<br>
conditions.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide the methods for catalyst<br>
separation and their reuse.<br>
Summary of the present invention<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a process<br>
comprising palladium in presence of one or more ligands containing coordinating<br>
nitrogen and/ or oxygen and/ or phosphorus atom/s catalysed carbonylation of enol<br>
Ester in presence of a hydroxyl compound to yield 2-acetoxy ester and/or 2-hydroxy<br>
ester of the coreesponding carboxylic acid at milder reaction conditions, which on<br>
further hydrolysis using acid catalysts to give 2-dydroxy carboxylic acid. In the process<br>
of the invention both carbonylation and hydrolysis catalysts are reusable.<br>
