PROBIOTIC BACTERIA BASED COMPOSITION AND USE THEREOF IN THE PREVENTION AND/OR TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY PATHOLOGIES AND/OR INFECTIONS AND IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE INTESTINAL FUNCTIONALITY *****<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to probiotic bacteria based compositions, if necessary integrated with pre-biotic substances, and the use thereof in the prevention and/or treatment of respiratory pathologies and/or infections and in the contemporaneous improvement of the intestinal functionality, which may result compromised from therapeutic treatments adopted for resolving said pathological conditions. In the last fifty years, the employ in the food field of probiotic bacteria has gained an always increasing importance.<br>
For "probiotic" it is understood to mean those living species-specific microorganisms which, when swallowed or applied in a sufficient number, are able to induce in the consumer specific functional and beneficial effects on the state of health of the host. If the action of the probiotic microorganism plays a pharmacologically active role towards pathological forms concerning the host, the probiotic microorganism<br><br>
-2-<br>
can be defined by the term "biotherapeutic agent", to testify the potential ability of supplying a valid help to the medical therapy.<br>
Therefore, considering that the beneficial properties of the probiotics can be both of a general systemic order and aimed to solve specific disorders or diseases, their use concerns various applicative fields, from the food industry to the pharmaceutical one. In the pharmaceutical field, the probiotic bacteria are usually employed, for example, in the prevention and treatment of intestinal pathologies of a different origin and nature.<br>
The possible beneficial action of the probiotic bacteria is also object of study, for example in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus of type 2, chronic autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies, tumor pathologies, high serum levels of cholesterol. However, the use of probiotic bacteria in the prevention and/or therapeutic treatment of the respiratory pathologies is not known.<br>
In particular, the use of probiotic bacteria, in association, or not, with opportune substances having pre-biotic properties for the prevention and/or treatment of respiratory pathologies and/or infections and, at the same time, for the improvement and/or the regu-<br><br>
-3-<br>
larization of the intestinal functionality, which can result compromised (indeed, very often it results compromised) by therapeutic treatments adopted for resolving said pathological conditions, is not known. Usually, the respiratory pathologies and/or infections are treated by using the administration, sometimes also massive and for prolonged times, of antibiotics and/or antiinflamatories.<br>
Unfortunately, the side effects caused by the use of these drugs are often troublesome, harmful and weakening for the organism.<br>
The object of the present invention is to prevent and/or therapeutically treat respiratory pathologies and/or infections of a various origin and nature, without causing undesired side effects, such as those induced by the traditional treatments with antibiotics and/or antiinflammatories.<br>
Another of the objects of the present invention is to prevent and/or therapeutically treat respiratory pathologies and/or infections of a various origin and nature, by simultaneously improving and/o regularizing the intestinal functionality of the organism, often compromised by said pathological conditions. These and other objects, which will better result from the following detailed description, have been attained<br><br>
-4-<br>

In another particularly preferred embodiment, the compositions of the present invention further include at least a pharmacologically active substance, so as to be able to perform a combined action to that exerted by said active substances.<br>
Advantageously, such associations are revealed synergic, accordingly allowing the use of relatively low doses of pharmaceutical active substance, with a considerable decrease of the possible side effects induced by the administration of the drug alone. Preferred pharmacologically active substances are, for example, selected from:<br>
antibiotics, antiinflammatories, immunomodulatings , mucolytics, antispasmodics, vitamins.<br>
The composition of the invention are preferably formulated in admixture with appropriate excipients, such as carriers, lubricants, dispersers, flavourings, sweeteners, stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, additives, such as amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, generally used in the formulation and the pharmaceutical art.<br>
By mere way of absolutely non limiting example, among the particularly preferred excipients and additives there may be mentioned starch, tween, fragrances, such as those of mandarin, grapefruit, strawberry, bil-<br><br>
-12-<br>
berry, all fruits, saccharose, glucose, acesulfame, aspartame, ascorbic acid, parabens, glutamine, argin-ine, superoxide dismutase, glutathione. Particularly preferred compositions of the present invention are those for oral administration. Typical preferred embodiments are, for example, capsules, beads, solutions or suspensions ready to drink, powders or granulates sachets (to be suspended or dissolved in water or non-carbonated and non-alcoholic beverages at the time of use) or similar forms, tablets, effervescent formulations.<br>
The compositions of the prevent invention can also be formulated in a coated, lacquered, encapsulated or microencapsulated form, so as to be gastroresistant. Said composition can also be formulated in a con-trolled-release form, so as to selectively release the active substances in the intestinal tract, particularly in the colon.<br>
Among the preferred embodiments of the present invention, there may be mentioned those formulations wherein the preferred bacterial strains of the invention are preferably used in a freeze-dried form. The freeze-drying of said strains, alone or in admixture with opportune excipients, is carried out by using techniques and equipments generally employed in<br><br>
-13-<br>
the freeze-drying processes of pharmaceutical and/or food compositions.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are prepared in a traditional way by using, depending on the type of formulation that one wishes to prepare, preparative techniques known to the skilled in the pharmaceutical sector.<br>
By way of absolutely non limitng example, a granular formulation, to be suspended or dissolved in water at the time of use, will be prepared by intimately mixing the components of the composition (active substances, co-adjuvants, excipients), reducing them to the desired granulometry and moisture degree, before packing them in single dose sealed sachets.<br>
In turn, a controlled-release composition will be, for example, prepared by microencapsulating or microcoat-ing the microgranulated mixture of the substances constituting the formulation with opportune mixtures of biocompatible polymers (such as, for example, Eudragit of different type and structure) resistant to the gastric juices of the stomach and able to release said components after a proper residence time in the gastrointestinal tract, or at pH values typical of the colon. The microencapsulated mixture thus obtained will be,<br><br>
-14-<br>
for example, used for the preparation of tablets, capsules or beads, depending on the selected commercial kind of presentation.<br>
As for the dosage,the bacterial species constituting the mixture of probiotic bacteria characterizing the present invention are present in a mutual weight ratio between 0.1:10 to 10:1, preferably in a mutual weight ratio between 0.5:1 to 2:1, more preferably in a mutual weight ratio of about 1:1.<br>
In the particularly preferred case wherein said mixture of probiotic bacteria consists of the three bacterial species Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus casei subsp. Rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, said bacterial species are preferably present in a weight ratio of 1:1:1.<br>
The additional probiotic, if any, is present in a weight ratio between 0:1 to 100:1, with respect to the total quantitative of the bacterial species of said mixture; preferably, in a weight ratio between 2:1 to 15:1; more preferably, from 5:1 to 10:1. The additional probiotic, if any, is present in a weight ratio between 0:1 to 10:1, with respect to the total quantity of the bacterial species of said mixture; preferably, in a weight ratio from 0.5:1 to 3:1. Each single bacterial species of said mixture of pro-<br><br>
-15-<br>
biotic bacteria of the present invention is present in a concentration between 1-106 UFC/dose to 1-1012 UFC/dose; preferably, from 1-109 UFC/dose to 1-1011 UFC/dose.<br>

f)- acesulfame: 0,2 g; g)- vitamin C: 0.3 g.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also contain one or more pharmacologically active substances. Said pharmacologically active substances can opportunely be formulated in admixture with the other components of the composition, such that they can be taken with a single administration.<br>
Said pharmacologically active substances can also be formulated in a discrete packages, so as to allow an independent administration (if necessary also in different times) of the components, however such that the synergic effect is maintained, depending on the requirements of the patient.<br>
In this case, independent packages are arranged, containing the composition of the present invention and the pharmacologically active substance/s, respectively.<br><br>
-18-<br>
The discrete packages above-mentioned are then introduced in a proper kit for allowing the patient to sequentially or separately take them, so as to benefit of a opportunely coordinated therapy depending on its own requirements.<br>
By mere way of example, a kit as the one above-mentioned can contain a number of sachets, or capsules, for the oral administration of the compositions of the present invention, in combination with a proper number of doses of antibiotic and/or multivitaminic complex and/or mucolytic, sufficient for a week of therapy. By way of absolutely non limiting example, in support of the wide application potential of the present invention, the results of a clinical study carried out with one of the preferred compositions of the same are shown hereinbelow.<br>
In a perspective study, conduced in double-blind randomized against placebo, the ability of the composition A of the present invention of improving the organism protection and restoring a normal state of health thereof towards the respiratory infections has been evaluated.<br>
The rational of the clinical trial carried out consists in that the medical literature data show the association existing between the predisposition to the<br><br>
-19-<br>
influenza like seasonal infections at the expense of the respiratory system (ILI and ARI) and the presence of an insufficient mucosal immunity.<br>
In particular, what observed during the years is an increase of the pathologies above-mentioned in those subjects that, for some reasons (such as for example physical stress, chronic pathologies, ageing) had a low protection from the mucosal immunity. The study has involved the enrolment of 23 7 subjects, of which 122 treated with the preparation A and 115 treated with placebo.<br>
The mean age of the two different samples was 35.8 (with standard deviation 15.3 years) and 34.1 (with standard deviation 16.3 years).<br>
To each patient of the first group, the intake per os of the sachet content of granulate of preparation A (by previous dissolution in water or other kind of non-carbonated nor alcoholic beverage) has been prescribed, each morning for 30 consecutive days. To the placebo group, the intake of the content of a sachet containing 5 g of glucose has been prescribed (with the same administration forms and posology). The course of the health condition of the enrolled subjects has been followed through the drawing up of a daily diary, in which those attending the study (or<br><br>
-20-<br>
the sanitary staff put in charge of'the control) have reported the daily presence of pathologies at the expense of the respiratory system (for the month of treatment or the two following months). Incidence, length and subjective gravity of the acute respiratory infections, as well as the course of the intestinal functionality have been examined. For the comparison between the frequencies of events between the two groups, the chi-square test with the Yates'correction has been used, while those relating to length and gravity of the cases found between the groups the ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) has been used, except for the case of non homogeneity of the variances (evaluated through the Bartlett's test), where it has been substituted by the Kruskall-Wallis's test. For the statistical analysis, the "Epi Info" programme, version 6.04d has been used.<br>
At the same time as the execution of the main trial, the validity of the defense provided to the organism by the symbiotic composition A has been evaluated on another group of subjects, in good health and without any pathologies at the expense of the respiratory system.<br>
On said subjects, the qualitative and quantitative dosage of the secretion at the mucosal level of the<br><br>
-21-<br>
secretory IgA has been carried out, before, during and for 30 days after the administration of the composition A.<br>
The experimentation has pointed out a statistically significant decrease of the length of the conditions generally considered (-1.32 days; p=0.016) and, in particular, for those due to infections of the high respiratory tracts (URTI; -2.83 days; p=0.034). It has also been found a reduction trend for the other considered pathologies categories, such as bronchitis, influenza, common cold, cough.<br>
The analytical determination of the secretory IgA in the salivary samples of the subjects treated with the composition A has pointed out an increasing production of the IgAs starting from the 5th-6th day from the beginning of the treatment, increase which has lasted up to about 4-14 days from the suspension of the same. This data confirms the effectiveness of the symbiotic composition A for increasing the systemic immune defences and of the mucose of the respiratory system, condition which, among other things, allows to prevent and fight infections caused by influenza and parain-fluenza virus.<br>
Also the inspection relating to the intestinal functionality (compromised by the pathologies above-<br><br>
-22-<br>
mentioned) which, following to the intake of the symbiotic composition has shown an improvement is revealed statistically significant, both in terms of reduction of the swelling and in terms of the regularity of the intestine.<br>
These inspections point out as the regular prolonged intake of a symbiotic pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is able to affect in a positive way the health of the organism, both in a preventive function and in a therapeutic function, towards the rspiratory pathologies and/or infections. With respect, in particular, to the preventive aspect, it is possible to state that the regular intake of a symbiotic pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is able to effectively protect the organism from the onset of the pathologies above-mentioned in competition with a traditional influenza vaccine, however without inducing the negative symptoms (for example generalized discomforts, intermittent occasional fever, pain in the bones and articulations and allergic reactions).<br>
Accordingly, the symbiotic compositions of the present invention can also be used for the preparation of a medicament acting as an influenza vaccine. Furthermore, it has also been pointed out that the in-<br><br>
-23-<br>
take of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is simultaneoulsy able to improve and/or regularize the intestinal functionality of the organism, often compromised by said pathologies.<br><br>
