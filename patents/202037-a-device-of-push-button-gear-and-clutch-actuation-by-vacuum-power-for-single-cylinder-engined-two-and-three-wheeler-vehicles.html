COMPLETE SPECIFICATIONS<br>
This invention is related to gear shifting and declutching operations of geared motor cycles, scooters and three wheeler autos.<br>
The gear shifting and declutching operations generally used in these vehicles are purely manually operated. That is the entire force required for their actuation is supplied manually by the driver. Also, steel wires with casings are generally used to transmit the manual force from the elements (like levers, etc.,) to the respective controls like clutch yoke and the gear shifter assembly (in case of scooters) at the engine.<br>
This conventional gear shifting and declutching operation and if s mechanisms have the following draw backs:<br>
1.	They are quite hard to operate causing stress and strain on the part of the driver<br>
2.	Frequent unavoidable use of them causes fatigue and pain to the driver<br>
3.	The steel wires such as gear wires and clutch wires break quite frequently because of their unavoidable limited thickness.<br>
4.	The steel wire assembles require frequent maintenance by way adjustments and lubricatk&gt;n.<br>
5.	If the wires are not maintained properiy or wrongly adjusted they further aggravate the already hard operation, resulting more strain on part of driver in operating the controls and more frequent failures of the wires.<br>
6.	Because of the draw backs as mentioned in 3,4,&amp; 5 above there will be increased running maintenance expenditure of the mechanism and also causing inconvenience due to sudden unexpected failures, besides discomfort in operating them.<br>
Therefore, ttie invention is aimed at drastically minimizing or even eliminating the above draw backs, in order to make the driving a pleasure.<br>
In this new concept, the entire force required for the operation is supplied through vacuum energy instead of manually in the conventional one.<br>
Hence, the driver need not have to apply hard force manually any more thereby giving relief from the painful operation.<br>
One of tile important feature of this concept is that the vacuum required for the operation is tapped calculatively from already existing vacuum in the inlet manifold,<br><br>
when the engine is running; thereby avoiding the use of a separate vacuum pump othen/vise required. The drivers roie is reduced just to gentiy pressing of soft push buttons/lever to effect gear shifting or declutching operations. The gear shifting is accomplished by gentle thumb press of two push buttons provided at the handle; one for ascending and the other for descending of gears shifting gears. Similarly, declutching is accomplished by gentle pull of tiny lever by one finger ( printing finger).<br>
The actual heavy force required for gear &amp; clutch operation is supplied by the vacuum energy. That means the driver only directs the heavy force provided by the vacuum energy to operate the controls just by the application of negligible force on push buttons/lever. This relieves stress and strain on part of driver. Broadly, this is how the new invention more or less eliminates the draw backs of conventional clutch &amp; gear operating system listed above.<br>
The vacuum powered gear shifting and declutching concept is described in detail with reference to accompanying drawing and illustrating the invention.<br>
The detailed connections of various system elements is as follows: [ refer to the<br>
Fig.1l.<br>
The copper tube '1' is inserted in to the intake manifold 'm' (through suitable drilled hole) between the flange of the manifold and the carburetor 'C' The copper tube 'r and the non-retum valve '2' are connected through PUN 4 X 0.75 mm tubing . The other end of ttie non-retum '2' valve is connected to receiver '3' through PUN 4X0.75 mm tubing. A vacuum gauge of range 25" of mercury is connected to the receiver through PUN 4 X 0.75 mm tubing. The receiver '3' and the distribution manifold '10' are connected through PUN 6X8 mm tubing. From distribution manifold '10\ two PUS tube connections lead to vacuum input ports of valves, one connecting the valve operating the clutch 5.3 and the other connecting parallely the valves 5.1 &amp; 5.2, operating the gears.<br>
Each of the vacuum output ports of the two valves 5.1 &amp; 5.2 operating the gears are connected to the two separate vacuum input ports of the OR logic element 6.1 and at the same time connecting their respective bellow actuators i.e. 5,1 to 8.1 and 5,2 to 8.2 through PUS tubing. Output port of the 6.1 logic element is in turn connected to one of the input port of other OR logic element 6.2, white output port of the valve 5.3 operating the clutch is connected to the remaining input port of the logic element 6.2 through PUS tubing &amp; suitable elbows. Output port of the logic element 6.2 is connected to Diaphragm actuator T' operating clutch.<br><br>
Finally for transmitting the required force &amp; movement from the actuators to the existing control mechanisms like gear shift lever (for shifting of gears) &amp; clutch yoke at the engine, they are suitably linked mechanically directly or indirectly i.e. either simply hinged or cabled (i.e. thick steel control cable) to their respective mechanisms directly or indirectly by simple mechanical or hydraulic conventional means as per the convenience in a particular vehicle. As an example in the motorcycle, the bellow actuator 8.1 top end, is hinged (through simple link, ref to fig. 1) to rear end of the gear shift lever for shifting the gears from neutral to 4^^ gear step by step, while the other bellow actuator 8.2 top end is similarly hinged at the front end of the gear shift lever (again through simple link, ref to fig.1) for shifting the gears from 4th to neutral step by step. The bottom end of the actuators are hinged to their respective clamps. The clamps in turn are conveniently fitted rigidly to the body of the motor cycle through existing bolts i.e., through a bolt of crash guard in case of 8.2 actuator, and through bolt hinging rear wheel suspension arm/yoke in case of 8.1 actuator.<br>
In the example referred above the diaphragm actuator for operating the clutch is suitably located clamped at one end to the frame / body. At the other end, it is linked through thick and strong steel control cable ( with outer) to the existing clutch operating yoke (at the engine) in the same manner as the conventional hand operated cable linked, keeping both the steel control cable connections at the yoke to be operated in parallel.<br>
The exact location and clamping of the actuators as well as the simple means of linkage for transmitting force depends on the convenience in a particular vehicle.<br>
The detailed function of system and various elements is as follows:[Refer to fig.]<br>
When engine runs, suction is created in the intake manifold 'M' during suction stroke. The vacuum is taped through the inserted copper tube 'V orifice, and carried to the non-return value '2\ As the suction created is not continuous but intermittent, the non return valve '2' does not allow leakage of vacuum back to the inlet manifold 'M' when ever there is no vacuum in the intake manifold 'M' or the vacuum in the intake manifold 'm' is lesser than the vacuum in the receiver '3'. Thus, the vacuum in the intake manifold 'M' is gradually drawn and stored in the receiver '3' through the non return<br><br>
valve '2\ When the engine is stopped, the non return valve 2' closes the connection between receiver 3 and the intake manifold 'M', thus keeping the vacuum in the receiver '3' intact i.e. without leaking out. This is how the vacuum energy of the engine is taped &amp; stored.<br>
When the vehicle has to move from neutral position, normally first gear is to be engaged while depressing the clutch. Both the actions are accomplished by pressing the single push button of the valve 5.1 gently with almost neglible thumb force. That is when the valve 5.1 is depressed, vacuum is applied to it's output port. From the output port, of the valve 5.1, the vacuum reaches to one of the input port of OR logic element 6.1 (through tube connection). Then it also reaches to output port of the same logic element 6.1 internally. Further the output port of the logic element 6.1 is connected to one of the input ort of another OR logic element 6.2 (through tubing). Finally, the output port of the logic element 6.2 gets the vacuum which in turn is connected to diaphragm actuator 7. That is, by pressing 5.1 valve, the vacuum reaches diaphragm actuator 7 through logic elements 6.1 &amp; 6.2, resulting in pull force by the diaphragm actuator 7. The pull force is transmitted to the clutch yoke/ lever at the engine, through thick steel control cable, causing declutching. As the 5.1 valve output port is parallelly connected to the bellow actuator 8.1, the vacuum is simultaneously applied to the actuator also exerting pull force on the hinged gear lever causing the gear lever to move on to first gear. Thus by gently pressing push button of the 5.1 valve, both declutching as well as gear shifting to 1st gear from is accomplished simultaneously. When push button of the 5.1 valve is released, the vacuum in the entire line between output port of 5.1 and diaphragm actuator 7 and bellow actuator 8.1 is released causing the actuators as well as the linkages to return to their normal positions.<br>
Shifting of gears to 2nd, 3rd and 4th would take place in the same sequential manner as that of shifting from neutral to 1st gear. The only requirement is to press and release the push button of 5.1 valve each time to shift to next higher gear. That is, whenever the push button of 5.1 valve is depressed, the gear would shift to the next higher one, like if it is in 1st, it goes to 2nd, if it is in 2nd it goes to 3rd and if it is in 3rd it goes to 4th gear.<br>
When shifting of gears to lower ones, say from 4th to 3rd is required, logically it works in the same manner as that of ascending of gears. The only minor differences being   (i) Instead of 5.1 valve, 5.2 valve is depressed (ii) Naturally instead of 5.1 valve<br><br>
output port getting connected to vacuum, 5.2 valve output port gets connected, (iii) The other output port of logic element 6.1 is supplied with vacuum to 5.2 valve output port, instead of the earlier ones, (iv) Instead of 8.1 actuator, it will be 8.2 actuator which gets the vacuum connection (as it is parallelly connected to output port of 5.2 valve).<br>
Since the 8.2 actuator is hinged to the front and of the gear shifting lever, any downward pull force exerted by the actuator would result in shifting the gears to next lower ones (in the motor cycle on which experiments were done) and the lever (as well as actuator) returns to it mean/normal position as soon as the 5.2 valve push button is released. This way every time a gear is to be shifted to the next lower one, the 5,2 valve push button is to be depressed (for a short while) and released.<br>
Note that the functioning of the logic element 6.2 as well as Diaphragm actuator 7 would remain same both for ascending as well as descending of gears. That is simultaneous declutching is done both in case of ascending as well as descending of gears. Also note that whenever 5.1 valve is actuated, 5.2 valve is isolated at the logic element 6.1 and vice versa. The 5.1 &amp; 5.2 valves are located just below the accelerator grip on the handle so as to be able to operate them with the right hand thumb.<br>
Whenever only clutch is required to be operated ( but not the gears) like for smooth start movement from first gear, the 5.3 valve is actuated through a small lever provided at the left hand side of the handle. It directly sends vacuum to the other input port of logic element 6.2 and subsequently to diaphragm actuator (for Clutch) causing declutching. Since the previous input port of the logic element 6.2 will be isolated under these circumstances, there will be no connection of vacuum to the bellow actuators 8.1 or 8.2 thereby maintaining their status quo.<br>
The operational advantage of the vacuum power operated clutch over the conventional one is that it can be operated even with just one finger and gentle force &amp; movement i.e. almost effortless operation of clutch, thus making driving pleasurable rather than painful.<br>
An example of the important elements construction pertaining to the mechanism invented, is shown in the accompanying drawings, where in<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional view of the non-return valve Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional view of 3 ports 2 position valve Fig. 4 shows the cross-sectional view of 'OR' logic element / valve Fig. 5 shows the cross-sectional view of the bellow actuator Fig. 6 shows the cross-sectional view of the diaphragm actuator<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the non-return valve consists of a main body 6 with provision for suitable port 7 to connect receiver, seating 5 for puppet 4, holes for pin3 retaining puppet 4, sleeve '2' containing port 1 to connect inlet manifold ; and floating soft conical headed rubber puppet 4 to close passage being pressed against its seat by atmospheric pressure whenever the vacuum in the receiver is higher than the vacuum in the inlet manifold, and open when the vacuum in the inlet manifold is higher.<br>
Fig. 3 shows that the three port two position valve consists of a main plastic body 9 with input port 8, output port 6, rubber puppet 11 pressed against it's sent by sprint 10 enclosed at one end by end cap 12 using '0' ring 13 for leak proof and at the other end by bellow dynamic seal 4 coupling stem 7 of push button 1 inserted in to the main body 9 and the push button 1 with spring 5 held in position by plastic holder 2. The puppet 11 together with it's seat and push button stem gives such a function that when the push button 1 is not pressed, the input port 8 is closed by the puppet 11 being pressed against it's seat by it's spring 10 and the output port6 is open to exhaust port 3 in the push button 1 which is held away from the puppet 11 by it's spring 10. When the push button 1 is pressed first the exhaust port 3 is closed from output port 6 byvirtue of the stem7 touching the puppet 11, then the input port 8 is connected to the output port 6 by virtue of the puppet leaving it's seat.<br>
Fig. 4 shows that the 'OR' logic element consists of a main body'1' counter bored at both ends of it's length (connecting each other) to provide room &amp; seating for the diaphragm seals '10' installed on each end of the grooved floating pin 9 to have slight end float so that if one diaphragm 10 touches it's seat the other diaphragm would automatically leave its seat. The counter bores are then closed at the ends by dummy plugs 7 with 'O' rings 8 for leak proof. The main body consists of (a) input port 2 connecting one end of the counter bore as well as parallel input port 5 (b) other input port 3 connecting other end of the counter bore as well as the parallel input port 6 (c) an output port 4 in the middle.   The element functions in such a way when a vacuum input<br><br>
is applied at say input port 2, it pulls its diaphragm away from its seating causing other end of the diaphragm to touch its seating thereby isolating the input port 3, while vacuum is supplied to output port 4 and also to parallel input port 5. In the same manner, when the vacuum is applied at input port 3, the input port 2 is isolated while supplying vacuum to output port 4 as well as the parallel input port 6.<br>
Fig. 5 shows that the bellow actuator consists of a mbber bellow 5 at one end of which a disc-shaped end cap 4 is inserted tightly, and at the other end of the bellow 5 a cup-shaped end cap 7 is inserted tightly to form a closed chamber between them inside the bellow for actuation. The cup-shaped end cap 6 has a welded bolt in the center which has drilled port 7 connecting into the closed chamber and threaded portion 8 for clamping purposes, while the disc-shaped end cap 4 has a 'U' shaped swivel link 2 fitted so that it can be hinged to the gear shift lever at its corresponding end to transmit force from actuator to the gear shift lever. The whole unit is meant to give a function such that when vacuum is applied to the bellow through the port the other end of the actuator it pulls the disc-shaped end cap 4 and thus the gear shift lever. When vacuum is released the bellow is brought back to its normal position by the gear shift lever. The cup-shaped end cap helps in reducing substantially the consumption of vacuum by the actuator by occupying unavoidable non-functional space inside the bellow for economical use of the vacuum. The inserted end caps helps in 100 % leak proof sealing. Also the bellow helps frictionless dynamic movement for actuation besides being cost effective.<br>
Fig.6 shows that the bellow actuator consists of two circular dish shaped end covers, one end cover '2 containing welded guide bush '8' while the other end cover 3 containing a welded metallic piece with port 7 and also taped holes for clamping, a diaphragm '5' supported by a movable disc like piston '5' is clamped between the covers in such a way that the pull rod '9' of piston passes out through the guide bush freely and the piston moving freely. The piston together with flexing diaphragm forms a leak proof chamber between the piston and the end cover 3 for connecting vacuum through the port. The whole unit functions such that when vacuum is applied at the port 7 it pulls the piston 5 together with the diaphragm 6 causing the pull rod '9' being drawn in. The pull rod connected to the clutch yoke of the engine pulls the yoke causing declutching, when the vacuum is withdrawn the piston and thus the clutch yoke return to their normal positions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
