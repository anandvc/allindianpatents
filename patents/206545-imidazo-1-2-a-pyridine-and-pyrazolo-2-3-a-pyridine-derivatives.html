COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"IMIDAZO[l,2-A]PYRIDINE	AND	PYRAZOLO[2,3-A]PYRIDINE<br>
DERIVATIVES"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S-15185 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives, orpharmaceutically acceptable salts or in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof, which possess cell-cycle inhibitory activity and are accordingly useful for their anti-cell-proliferation (such as anti-cancer) activity arid are therefore useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said pyrimidine derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments of use in the production of an anti-cell-proliferation effect in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
A family of intracellular proteins called cyclins play a central role in the cell cycle. The synthesis and degradation of cyclins is tightly controlled such that their level of expression fluctuates during the cell cycle. Cyclins bind to cyclin-dependent serihe/threonine kinases (CDKs) and this association is essential for CDK (such asCDKl, CDK2, CDK4 and/or CDK6) activity within the cell. Although the precise details of how each of these factors combine to regulate-CDK activity is poorly understood, the balance between the two dictates whether or not the cell will progress through the cell cycle.<br>
The recent convergence of oncogene and tumour suppressor gene research has identified regulation of entry into the cell cycle as a key control point of mitogenesis in tumours. Moreover, CDKs appear to be downstream of a number of oncogene signalling pathways. Disregulation of CDK activity by upregulation of cyclins and/or deletion of endogenous inhibitors appears to be an important axis between mitogenic signalling pathways and proliferation of tumour cells.<br>
Accordingly it has been recognised that an inhibitor of cell cycle kinases, particularly inhibitors of CDK2, CDK4 and/or CDK6 (which operate at the S-phase, Gl-S and Gl-S phase respectively) should be of value as a selective inhibitor of cell proliferation, such as growth of mammalian cancer cells.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that certain pyrimidine compounds surprisingly inhibit the effects of cell cycle kinases showing selectivity for CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, and thus possess anti-cell-proliferation properties. Such properties are expected to be af value in the treatment of disease states associated with aberrant cell cycles and cell proliferation such as cancers (solid tumours and leukemias), fibroproliferative and iifferentiative disorders, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma.<br><br>
acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, atherosclerosis, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, bone diseases and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br>

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately<br><br>
following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl-or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will alsobe appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups maybe used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or f-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a /-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis<br><br>
acid for example boron tris(trifIuoroacetate), A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group,<br>
for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis<br>
with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a /-butyl group which may be removed,<br>
for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic<br>
acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation<br>
over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using<br>
conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
As stated hereinbefore the compounds defined in the present invention possesses<br>
anti-cell-proliferation activity such as anti-cancer activity which is believed to arise from the<br>
CDK inhibitory activity of the compound. These properties may be assessed, for example,<br>
using the procedure set out below:-<br>
Assay<br>
The following abbreviations have been used :-<br>
HEPES is N-[2-Hydroxyemyl]piperazine-N-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]<br>
DTT is Dithiothretiol<br>
PMSF is Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride<br>
The compounds were tested in an in vitro kinase assay in 96 well format using<br>
Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA - obtained from Amersham) for measuring incorporation<br>
of [y-33-P]-Adenosine Triphosphate into a test substrate (GST-Retinoblastoma protein;<br>
GST-Rb). In each well was placed the compound to be tested (diluted in DMSO and water to<br><br>
trrect concentrations) and in control wells either roscovitine as an inhibitor control or DMSO a positive control.<br>
Approximately 0.2nl of CDK2/Cyclin E partially-purified enzyme (amount dependent on enzyme activity) diluted in 25\i\ incubation buffer was added to each well then 20ul of GST-Rb/ATP/ATP33 mixture (containing 0.5ug GST-Rb and 0.2uM ATP and 0.14uCi [y-33-P]-Adenosine Triphosphate in incubation buffer), and the resulting mixture shaken gently, then incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes.<br>
To each well was then added 150uL stop solution containing (0.8mg/well of Protein A-PVT SPA bead (Amersham)), 20pM/well of Anti-Glutathione Transferase, Rabbit IgG (obtained from Molecular Probes), 61mM EDTA and 50mM HEPES pH 7.5 containing 0.05% sodium azide.<br>
The plates were sealed with Topseal-S plate sealers, left for two hours then spun at 2500rpm, 1124xg., for 5 minutes. The plates were read on a Topcount for 30 seconds per well. The incubation buffer used to dilute the enzyme and substrate mixes contained 50mM HEPES pH7.5, lOmM MnCl2, ImM DTT, lOOuM Sodium vanadate, lOOuM NaF, lOmM Sodium Glycerophosphate, BSA (lmg/ml final). Test substrate<br>
In this assay only part of the retinoblastoma protein (Science 1987 Marl3;235(4794):1394-1399; Lee W.H., Bookstein R., Hong R, Young L.J., Shew J.Y., Lee E.Y.) was used, fused to a GST tag. PCR of retinoblastoma gene encoding amino acids 379-928 (obtained from retinoblastoma plasmid ATCC pLRbRNL) was performed, and the sequence cloned into pGEX 2T fusion vector (Smith D.B. and Johnson, K.S. Gene 67,31 (1988); which contained a tac promoter for inducible expression, internal lac F gene for use in any E.Coli host, and a coding region for thrombin cleavage - obtained from Pharmacia Biotech) which was used to amplify amino acids 792-928. This sequence was again cloned intopGEX2T.<br>
The retinoblastoma 792-928 sequence so obtained was expressed in E.Coli (BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells ) using standard inducible expression techniques, and purified as follows. E.coli paste was resuspended in lOml/g of NETN buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.5,120mM NaCl, ImM EDTA, 0.5%v/v NP-40, ImM PMSF, lug/ml leupeptin, lug/ml aprotinin and lug/ml pepstatin) and sonicated for 2 x 45 seconds per 100ml homogenate. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 10ml glutathione Sepharose column<br><br>
(Pharmacia Biotech, Herts, UK), and washed with NETN buffer. After washing with kinase buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, lOmM MgCI2, ImM DTT, lmM PMSF, lug/ml leupeptin, lug/ml aprotinin and lug/ml pepstatin) the protein was eluted with 50mM reduced glutathione in kinase buffer. Fractions containing GST-Rb(792-927) were pooled and dialysed overnight against kinase buffer. The final product was analysed by Sodium Dodeca Sulfate (SDS) PAGE (Polyacrylamide gel) using 8-16% Tris-Glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, USA). CDK2 and Cvclin E<br>
The open reading frames of CDK2 and Cyclin E were isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using HeLa cell and activated T cell mRNA as a template and cloned into the insect expression vector pVL1393 (obtained from Invitrogen 1995 catalogue number: VI392-20). CDK2 and cyclin E were then dually expressed [using a standard virus Baculogold co-infection technique] in the insect SF21 cell system (Spodoptera Frugiperda cells derived from ovarian tissue of the Fall Army Worm * commercially available). Example production of Cvclin E/CDK2<br>
The following Example provides details of the production of Cyclin E/CDK2 in SF21 cells (in TCI00 + 10% FBS(TCS) + 0.2% Pluronic) having dual infection MOI3 for each virus of Cyclin E &amp; CDK2.<br>
SF21 cells grown in a roller bottle culture to 2.33 x 106 cells/ml were used to inoculate 10 x 500 ml roller bottles at 0.2 x 10E6 cells/ml. The roller bottles were incubated on a roller rig at 28°C.<br>
After 3 days (72 hrs.) the cells were counted, and the average from 2 bottles found to be 1.86 x 10E6 ceils/ml. (99% viable). The cultures were then infected with the dual viruses at an MOI 3 for each virus.<br>
The viruses were mixed together before addition to the cultures, and the cultures returned to the roller rig 28°C.<br>
After 2 days (48 hrs.) post infection the 5 Litres of culture was harvested. The total cell count at harvest was 1.58 x 10E6 cells/ml.(99% viable). The cells were spun out at 2500rpm, 30 mins., 4°C in Heraeus Omnimge 2.0 RS in 250 ml. lots. The supernatant was discarded.<br>
Partial co-purification of Cdk2 and Cyclin E<br>
Sf2l cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 8.2, lOmM MgCI2, ImM DTT, lOmM glycerophosphate, O.lmM sodium orthovanadate, O.lmM NaF, ImM PMSF,<br><br>
lug/ml leupeptin and lug/ml aprotinin) and homogenised for 2 minutes in a 10ml Dounce homgeniser. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Poros HQ/M 1.4/100 anion exchange column (PE Biosystems, Hertford, UK). Cdk2 and Cyclin E were coeluted at the beginning of a 0-1M NaCl gradient (run in lysis buffer minus protease inhibitors) over 20 column volumes. Co-elution was checked by western blot using both anti-Cdk2 and anti-Cyclin E antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California, US).<br>
By analogy, assays designed to assess inhibition of CDFC4 and CDK.6 may be constructed. CDK2 (EMBL Accession No. X62071) may be used together with Cyclin A or Cyclin E (see EMBL Accession No. M73812), and further details for such assays are contained in PCT International Publication No. W099/21845, the relevant Biochemical &amp; Biological Evaluation sections of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula (I) vary with structural change, in general activity possessed by compounds of the formula (I) may be demonstrated at JC50 concentrations or doses in the range 250uM to InM.<br>
When tested in the above in-vitro assay the CDK2 inhibitory activity of Example 11 was measured as IC50 = 0.19uM and that of Example 12 as IC50 = 0.17jiM.<br>
The in vivo activity of the compounds of the present invention may be assessed by standard techniques, for example by measuring inhibition of cell growth and assessing cytotoxicity.<br>
Inhibition of cell growth maybe measured by staining cells with Sulforhodamine B (SRB), a fluorescent dye that stains proteins and therefore gives an estimation of amount of protein (i.e. cells) in a well (see Boyd," M.R.(1989) Status of the NCI preclinical antitumour drug discovery screen. Prin. Prac Oncol 10:1-12). Thus, the following details are provided of measuring inhibition of cell growth :-<br>
Cells were plated in appropriate medium in a volume of 100ml in 96 well plates; media was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle media for MCF-7, SK-UT-1B and SK-UT-1. The cells were allowed to attach overnight, then inhibitor compoundsrwefe added at various concentrations in a maximum concentration of 1% DMSO (v/v). A control plate was assayed to give a value for cells before dosing. Cells were incubated at 37°C, (5% CO2) for three days.<br>
At the end of three days TCA was added to the plates to a final concentration of 16% (v/v). Plates were then incubated at 4°C for 1 hour, the supernatant removed and the plates washed in tap water. After drying, 100ml SRB dye (0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid) was added<br><br>

the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br>
We have found that the compounds defined in the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, are effective cell cycle inhibitors (anti-cell proliferation agents), which property is believed to arise from their CDK inhibitory properties. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by CDK enzymes, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce a CDK inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating the proliferation of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of CDK enzymes, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce an anti-prpliferative effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of CDKs. Such a compound of the invention is expected to possess a wide range of anti-cancer properties^as CDKs have been implicated in many common human cancers such as leukaemia and breast, lung, colon, rectal, stomach, prostate, bladder, pancreas and ovarian cancer. Thus it is expected that a compound of the invention will possess anti-cancer activity against these cancers. It is in addition expected that a compound of the present invention will possess activity against a range of leukaemias, lymphoid malignancies and solid tumours such as carcinomas and sarcomas in tissues such as the liver, kidney, prostate and pancreas. In particular such compounds of the invention are expected to slow advantageously the growth of primary and recurrent solid tumours of, for example, the colon, breast, prostate, lungs and skin. More particularly such compounds of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, are expected to inhibit the growth of those primary and recurrent solid tumours which are associated with CDKs, especially those tumours which are significantly dependent on CDKs for their growth and spread, including for example, certain tumours of the colon, breast, prostate, lung, vulva and skin.<br>
It is further expected that a compound of the present invention will possess activity against other cell-proliferation diseases in a wide range of other disease states including leukaemias, fibroproliferative and differentiative disorders, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, atherosclerosis, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, bone diseases and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.<br><br>

Particularly, an inhibitory effect is produced by preventing entry into or progression through the S phase by inhibition of CDK2, CDK4 and/or CDK6, especially CDK2.<br>
As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular cell-proliferation disease will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. A unit dose in the range, for example, 1-100 mg/kg, preferably 1-50 mg/kg is envisaged.<br>
