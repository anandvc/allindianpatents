				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING INDOLINONE DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a process for preparing indohnone derivatives and intermediates of that process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A number of indolinone derivatives have been found to exhibit pharmaceutical activity. Due to the ability to modulate the protein kinase activity, they have been suggested to treat an number of conditions such as various types of cancer, mastocytosis, allergy ; associated chronic rhinitis, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, restenosis, fibrosis, psoriasis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, angiogensis, inflammatory disorders, immunological disorders, and cardiovascular disorders (WO 01/45689, WO 01/60814, WO 99/48868, US-A-6,316,429, US-A-6,316,635,6,133,305, and US-A-6,248,771).<br>
Among the indolinone derivatives those having an amide group on a heterocyclic ring condensed with the indolinone have been of interest. These compounds modulate protein kinase activity and are thus useful in treating diseases relating to abnormal protein kinase activity. A process for preparing the amide derivatives is disclosed in WO 01/60814. An appropriate pyrrole is formylated and subsequently condensed with a 2-indolinone to give a respective 5-(2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindole -3-ylidenemethyl) -IH-pyrrole. If an amide derivative of the pyrrole is desired, a pyrrole having a carboxylic acid group is selected. The carboxylic acid group is reacted with the desired amine in the presence of dimethylformamide, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. In example 129 a scale-up procedure is disclosed in which the amidation is conducted in the presence of dimethyHbrmamide, benzotaazole-l-yloxytris(dimemylair]ino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and triethylamine.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for preparing indolinone derivatives which have an amide group on a heterocyclic nng condensed<br>
with the indolinone.<br>

The compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods well known in the art. For example, heterocycles having a formyl group can be obtained by slowly adding POCl3 to dimethylformamide followed by addition of the appropriate heterocycle, which is also dissolved in dimethylformamide. This reaction is described in more detail and exemplified e.g. in WO 01/60814, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in a polar aprotic solvent. An aprotic solvent is any solvent that, under normal reaction conditions, does not donate a proton to a solute. Polar solvents are those which have a non-uniform distribution of charge. Generally they include 1 to 3 atoms selected from heteroatom such as N, S or 0. Examples of polar aprotic solvents that can be used in the invention are ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, methyl tert-buryl ether; nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile; and amide solvents such as dimethylformamide. Preferably the reaction solvent is an ether, more preferably the solvent is tetrahydrofuran. Mixtures of the solvents may also be employed. The aprotic, polar solvent preferably has a boning point from 30 °C to 130 °C, more preferably from 50 °C to 80 °C. Both components of the reaction are introduced into a reaction vessel together with the solvent. The reactants may be added in any order, although it is preferred to add compound I to a stirred suspension of compound IT in a suitable solvent, at room temperature (18-25 °C). A reactant concentration of 0.3 to 0.5 moles / liter is preferred,.although the person of skill in the art will appreciate that the reaction may be conducted at different<br>
concentrations.   The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of 0° C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent. However, it is preferred to conduct the reaction at a temperature of 25° C to SO0 C with mechanical stirring. The progress of the reaction may be monitored by a suitable analytical method, such as HPLC. Upon completion of the reaction the reaction mixture is cooled and the intermediate compound HI crystallizes. It is preferred to cool the reaction mixture to a temperature below room temperature and 0° C is most preferred. The intermediate compound IH may be separated from the reaction mixture by methods known to those skilled in the art, such, as centrifuging, and filtration. Intermediate HI is a crystalline solid that is non-hygroscopic and is stable in air at room temperature.<br>

wherein R1, R2, R3 R4 are as defined above and an amine of general formula (V)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R6 is as defined above to form the indolinone of the general formula (VI). The reaction can be carried out in solution, using the same solvents used in the first reaction step. The reaction may be carried out sequentially by reacting compound HI with either compound compound IV or compound V and then adding the other compound. However, it is preferred that compounds II, IV and V are introduced into a reaction vessel together with the solvent. The reactants may be added in any order, although it is preferred to add compound m to a stirred suspension of compound IV and the amine V in a suitable solvent, at room temperature (18 - 25 °C). A reactant concentration of 0.3 to 0.5 moles / liter is preferred, although the person of skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that the reaction may be conducted at different concentrations. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of 50° C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent. However, it is preferred to conduct the reaction at a temperature of 50° C to 80° C with mechanical stirring. The progress of the reaction may be monitored by a suitable analytical method., such as HPLC. Upon completion of the reaction., the reaction mixture is cooled and compound VI crystallizes. It is preferred to cool the reaction mixture to a temperature below room temperature and 0° C is most preferred. Compound VI may be separated from the reaction mixture by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as centrifuging, and nitration. Although Compound VI obtained from the process above is often of sufficient purity for medical use, if desired, compound VI may be further purified by methods known to those skilled in the art,<br>
such, as recrystallization.<br>
If desired the indolinone compounds of general formula (VI) can be further reacted to<br>
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives according to conventional<br>
processes.<br>

more convenient than the prior art processes. Generally the intermediates are easier to<br>
handle. Furthermore, product isolation is facilitated.<br>
