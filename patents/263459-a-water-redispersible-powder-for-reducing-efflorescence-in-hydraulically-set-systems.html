The present invention relates to a powder redispersible in water for the reduction of efflorescence in hydraulically set systems based on at least one organic<br>
 component and at1east one water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, to a process for its production including dispersion with subsequent drying, it being possible to omit the drying step, and to its advantageous use in particular as additive for hydraulically setting systems for the reduction of efflorescence in   hydraulically set   systems.<br>
Efflorescence is known to occur in particular in cementitious systems such as concrete, rendering and mortars. The expert means by it whitish deposits on the surface which are formed above all by leached-out calcium hydroxide which is react ed further by carbon dioxide from the air to for m calcium carbonate. In this case, further salt deposits imy also be present. Although such effect  for esc enc e usually have major or influence on the physical values of the substrate, they are regarded a major nuisance particularly in the case of   coloured   or   grey surfaces.<br>
Lacking alternatives, the for mulation developer frequently tries to prevent efflorescence by means of hydrophobic additives. In this case, the idea plays a part that, if no water is able to penetrate into the mortar layer, rendering layer or concrete layer, no calcium hydroxide can be washed out. However, this is an erronecus conelusion to be drawn: on the one hand, the freshly applied material still contains a lot of water which, together with dissolved salts, migrates to the surface. If the water evaporates, the salt residues remain    as    undesired    residues.     In    addition,    water    can<br><br>
also diffuse from the other side through the hydraulically set meterial and thus have the same effect.<br>
. On the other hand, it is practically impossible to obtain absolute hydrophobicity. Even if the surface exhibits an excellent water repellency, it is sufficient, if only a little water penetrates inside, to leave a whit e residue behind after drying of the water droplet. Thus, many highly hydrophobic materials exhibit a stronger efflorescence effect than others, This shows also clearly that hydrophobicity and efflorescence are based on quite different mechanisms and   are not   comparable with   each   other.<br>
Thus, DE 103 23 205 A1, for example, describes a hydrophobing, water-redispersible additive based on fatty acids and their derivatives which contain water-soluble protective colloids and one or several compounds from the group of fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives which, under alkaline conditions, liberate fatty acid or the corresponding fatty acid anion, where required in combination with one or several organosilie on compounds. By using this additive in mortars, the water absorption is substantially reduced but not prevented. There is no mention of a possible reduction of efflorescence. Moreover, highly volatile organic components ( VOC) are usually for med by the alkaline hydrolysis   of  the fatty acid derivatives.<br>
US 3,423,219 describes a process for the production of Portland cement. During this process, an aqueous dispersion of a mixture of tall oil resin and high-boiling fractions of tall oil is preferably admixed to the Portlandcement as painting aid. The process for the production of such dispersions comprises, among other things , an alka1ine treatment and is consequently conplicated and expensive- The use of such systems for reducing    efflorescence   is    not    mentioned,     Mor eover ,    no<br><br>
powders that are soluble or redispersible in water are described, which makes the use of dry mortars, in particular,   impossible,<br>
GB 1,088,484 A describes a process for inhibiting efflorescence in concrete based on Portland cement. In this case, an aqueous dispersion of a mixture of tall oil resin and high-boiling fractions of tall oil, partially also mixed with asphalt, is preferably admixed to the concrete or subsequently applied onto the surface. The process for the production of such dispersions corrpris es , among other things , an alka1in e treatment and is consequently highly corrplicated and thus expensive, the dark to black colour of the mixture restricting its use considerably. To stabilise the dispersions, 0.1 to 15% by weight of proteins or polysaccharides are used. In addition, no powders soluble or redispersible in water are described, which makes   the use in  particular   in  dry  mortars   impossible.<br>
In DE 33 21 027 Al, a process is described by means of which a reduction of the efflorescence and a reduction of the water absorption, among other things, apparently occurs. During this process, terpene polymers, in particular of liquid low-molecular terpenes, are added as such or in mixture with other terpene hydrocarbons, which are added  to the cement-containing building materials in a quantity of 0.1-10% by weight. The addition of the terpene-bas ed compounds takes place in the emulsified form or by spraying liquid or dissolved terpenes, precluding the use in dry mortars, among other things. Moreover, no details are provided regarding the type of terpenes used or the emulsifiers by way  of   which  the terpene compounds   are   emulsified,<br>
JP   1   252   652   A describes   an   aqueous   dispersion   with   an excellent       stability      for      paper       applications,       for<br><br>
example. In this process, a hydrophobic substanc e with<br>
a low molecular weight is dispersed by means of a<br>
modified polyvinyl alcohol which contains a special<br>
cationic group, it being possible for the hydrophobic<br>
substance with a low molecular weight to be a resin.<br>
The aqueous dispersion described can be produced only<br>
with major effort since the polyvinyl alcohol with the<br>
cationic group must be produced first separately by<br>
means of the radical polymerisation of vinyl acetate<br>
and dimethyl amino ethyl vinyl ether, for exanple, with<br>
subsequent       saponification       of       the      copolymer.	In<br>
addition,    this   dispersion   is   not    obtainable   in   powder form and   has   a   quite different   field   of   application.<br>
In EP 874 471 Bl, a redispersible dispersion powder corrposition is described, which consists of a wat er-insoluble base polymer from the group of homopolymers and copolymers and a water soluble atomisation protective colloid which contains also up to 100% by weight, bas ed on the base polymer, of tackifying substanc es. The water-soluble atomising protactive colloid is a non-neutralised or a partially neutralised special polymer based on homopolmers or copolymers of olefinically unsaturat ed monocarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acids or their anhydrides, the acid cont ent of the polymer amounting to 50 mole% or more. The pH of the aqueous redispersion is below 4.5. These systems can be used as adhesive composition but should also be used in cement-containing trowelling corrpounds, or in structural adhesives. However, these speciality polymers rapidly form corrplex corrpounds with calcium ions in hydraulically setting systems, and other ions which has a highly negative effect on hydration (substantial retardation) and on the mortar rheology (partial stiffening). For this reason, they have little suitability    in     particular     for     us e    in     cementitious<br><br>
systems.     A   possible   reduction    of    efflorescence   is   not mentioned.<br>
EP 87 4 877 B1 describes a tackifyer powder composition<br>
redispersible in water containing one or several<br>
tackifying substances and 2 to 50% by weight of at<br>
least one conpound from the group of wat er-soluble low<br>
molecular homopolymers or copolymers of olefinically<br>
unsaturated monocarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acids<br>
or their anhydrides, which contain, as copolymers, 2 to<br>
50 mole% of further free radical polymer is able monomers<br>
and phenol sulphonic acid condensates, melamine<br>
sulphonic acid condensates and naphthalene sulphonic<br>
acid condensates with a water solubility of at least<br>
10g in 100 g of water and a molecular weight of maximum<br>
250,000g/mole. The tackifying substances are used as<br>
emulsif i er-stabilis ed	dispersions	and	ar e        not<br>
stabilised with these polymers. In addition, they are us ed as adhesives and not in cemaititious systems, in particular  not   for  the reduction   of   efflorescence.<br>
EP 799 876 A2 describes an adhesive composition in powder form which contains at least one polymer based on at least one dispersion, at least one tackifying resin and, where required, one or several pr ot ective colloids as well as anticaking agents. This adhesive corrposition is suitable for adhesive-bonding porous and semi-porous substances, in particular as f looring adhesive. Use in hydraulically setting systems is not mentioned, in particular not the use for reducing efflorescence. Moreover, it is essential for a polymer based on at least one dispersion to be contained therein, which restricts the possibilities of formulation   exceedingly.<br>
It has been the object of the invention to provide an additive which  prevents   or   at   least   greatly reduces  the<br><br>
efflorescence of hydraulically set systems, in<br>
particular those based on cement, such as e.g, in<br>
mortars,  and in the case of concrete. In addition, the<br>
additive should be present in powder form in particular<br>
for the formulation of dry mortars in order to<br>
circumvent the known disadvantages of liquid raw<br>
iTHterials such as e. g. lack of resistance to<br>
freezing/thawing or limited storage stability, without<br>
the addition of toxic biocides and to allow sinple<br>
metering in the case of dry mortar formulations.<br>
However, it should also be possible to meter in the<br>
additive in the liquid form for selected applications<br>
such as e, g. the manufacture of concrete. In addition,<br>
it is essential that this additive be suitable for<br>
simply being stirred into the mortar rratrix mixed with<br>
water without special mixing proc ess es having to be<br>
taken int o account. In this case, it is also very<br>
irrportant that the additive can be thoroughly wetted in<br>
the	mortar	mixture,	redispersed	and	easily<br>
homogeneously distributed in the matrix. In addition, it is irrportant that no disadvantageous or other mortar properties are obtained by way of the additive, i. e, it should be possible for the additive to be introduced into existing mortar formulations without their properties, such as e. g. the mortar rheology, being modified, except for the desired strong reduction of the efflorescence effect and, where applicable, an improvement in the hydrophobicity and/or adhesive capacity of the mortar. It should additionally be possible to meter the additive independently of other mortar raw naterials providing the formulator with a very high level of flexibility. In addition, it is important that the raw material costs and production costs of the dry mortar are not or only slightly altered by the additive. When producing the additive, it should, mor eover, be possible to simply vary the primar y   particle   size   without    problem   in    order   to   be<br><br>
able  to   adjust   the final   characteristics   in   a   targeted manner.      Moreover,     it    is    advantageous    if     at    'least     a major     part      of     the     additive    can     be     obtained     from renewable  resources.    Also,   the   additive  should   have  no or   only a   very low  hazards   classification.<br>
Surprisingly enough, it was possible to achieve the corrplex object by way of a powder redispersible in water for reducing efflorescence in hydraulically set systems bas ed on at least one organic conponent and at 1east on e water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid   and,   where required,   further   additives,   whereas<br>
a)	the organic c omponent containing at least one<br>
compound with a cyclic group, the compound being<br>
completely or partially saturated and having a melting<br>
point of approximately -20 to 250° C and a molecular<br>
weight of about 100 to 10,000 and the organic corrponent<br>
containing at erpenoid, a resin acid, colophony,<br>
terpene resin, t erpene-phenol resin and/or their<br>
d er i vat i v es ,   and<br>
b)	f or ming, with the wat er-solubl e organic polymeric protective colloid, a stable dispersion in water, the wat er -soluble organic polymeric prot ective colloid having a content of monocarboxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid as well as their anhydrides of less than 50 mole% and not consisting of aromatic sulphonic acid  condensat es   and<br>
c)	the weight ratio of the organic component to the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid being   95   :    5   to  5   :    95.<br>
The organic component with a conpletely or partially saturated cyclic group can be a synthetically produced product   or   a natural  product.    Suitable natural  products<br><br>
are in particular resins such as gum rosin, wood rosin,<br>
tall oil resin and/or polyterpene resins, it being<br>
possible for these to be present in the modified and/or<br>
unmodified form, it being possible for the modification<br>
to be of natural or synthetic origin. Preferred<br>
terpeneoids	are	monot erpen es,	s esquit erpen es ,<br>
diterpenes , sesterterpenes , triterpenes , tetraterpenes and polyt erpen es. Terpene resins are typically obtained by the polymerisation of terpenes, diterpenes and/or limonenes and terpene-phenol resins can be produced by the acid-catalysed addition of phenols to terpenes and/or colophon y, but rrey also be bas ed on other subst anc es.<br>
It is important for the organic conponent to contain at<br>
least        on e       c yclic        group.	Monoc yclic ,        dic yclic ,<br>
trieyclic , tetracyclic and/or pentacyclic groups are pr ef err ed. A special embodiment consists of organic conponents containing at least one cyclic group with a C5- ring and/or C6,- ring. In addition, the cyclic group can be completely or partially saturated- A special embodiment contains two or more C =C double bonds,- at 1east  two  being conjugated with   each  other.<br>
The  organic   corrponent   may additionally contain   at   least one compound  with   one or  several  functional  groups   such as     e, g,     amine    groups,     amide    groups,     amidin e    groups, imine  groups,    anhydride  groups,    ester   groups,    sulphate groups,       sulphonat e      groups       and/or      thiol       groups. Comounds      with      carboxyl      groups,      carbon yl      groups, aldehyde   groups   and/or   alcohol   groups   are  particularly pr ef err ed,    whereas    resin    acids    and   their    derivatives are particularly preferred.<br>
The following are, for example, suitable organic components: monoterpenes such as carrphor, camhoric acid,      is onitrosocarrphor,      camphor      quinone,       menthol.<br><br>
limonene,    pinene,    carrphor   carboxylic   acid   and/or   alkyl<br>

The    organic    compon ent     should    have    a     melting    point, determined    by   DSC   (DIN  51007,    of    approximately   -20   to 250° C,    in    particular    of    approxi net ely   0    to   200°C    and particularly   preferably   of    approximately   50    to   180° C. If   the organic  corrponent   has   a   melting  range and  not   an actual    melting   point,    the   average   temperature   of    the melting   range   is   used   to   determine  the   melting   point. If,    for    example,    no    melting   point    can    be   determined becaus e   of   thermal   decoirposition,    the   softening   point or   the   average  temperature   of   the   softening   point   can be used   as   an   alternative instead   of  the  melting  point. Moreover,   the  molecular  weight   of  the organic   corrponent should     be    between    approximately    100     and    10,000,     in particular     between     approxiiret ely    200     and     5000     and particularly   pr ef erably   between    approxi mat ely   300    and 2500.    In   the  case   of   low-molecular   corrpounds,    this   is typically determined   via  the  structural   formula   and   in the    cas e    of     higher     mol ecular    products     by    means     of static   light   scatt ering*<br>
The   organic    corrponent    is    typically   insoluble   or    only slightly  soluble  in   water.    In   a   special   embodiment,   it<br><br>
is not or only slightly soluble in acidic to n eutral<br>
water, the solubility being less than approxi nat ely 10%<br>
by weight, preferably less than approximately 1% by<br>
weight and in particular less than 0. 1% by weight. In a<br>
further pr ef erred embodi ment, the organic c onpon ent is<br>
partially or completely soluble in dilute caustic soda<br>
solution,	the        solubility        being        greater        than<br>
approxi mat ely 0.01% by weight, pr ef erably gr eat er than approximately 0, 1% by weight and in particular greater than approxi rrat ely 1% by weight at a pH in the range of approxi KBt ely 8 to 12. The solubiliti es r elat e to a terrperature  of   20° C,<br>
It    is   helpful   for   the   water-soluble   organic    polymeric prote::tive colloid  to form a  stable dispersion  with  the organic    corrponent    in    aqueous    solution,    the   dispersion still   has   after   24   hours   the   same   physical   properties such   as    e, g.    pH,    viscosity,    particle   size   and   colour, and     a     s eparation,      e. g.      s ettling     out     of     dispersion particles,   does   not   occur.    Sine e,   depending   on   the t ype of    organic    coupon ent,    dif f er ent    wat er-soluble   organic polymeric      prot active     colloids      provide     the     desired dispersion    stability,    an    organic   polymeric    prot active colloid    may   be   ideal   f or   c ertain    organic   c orrpon ents, whereas   an   inc ompatibilit y  imy occur  with   other   organic coirponents.      For    this     reason,     the    organic     polymeric prot ective    colloid     must     be     matched    to    the     organic conponent.      Stabilising     systems     are    preferred     which allow,     in     a     sirrple     rrenner,     the    aqueous     dispersion corrposition   obtained  to  be converted  into powders  which are redispersible in  water.<br>
Typically, suitable wat er-soluble organic polymeric prot ective colloids are pref erably higher molecular conpounds. These include natural corrpounds such as polysaccharid es which, wher e r equir ed, are chemically modif i ed,     s ynthetic     higher     mol ecular     oligomers     and<br><br>

pr ef err ed, it being possible f or one or s everal polyvinyl alcohols to be used together., where required with snell quantities of suitable emulsifiers. Preferred synthetic stabilising systems are, in particular, modif i ed and/or unmodified polyvinyl alcohols with a degree of hydrolysis of 80 to 98mole% and a Hoppler vise osit y as 4% aqueous s oluti on of 1 t o 50 mPas and/or polyvinyl pyrr olid one, Wat er-soluble organic polymeric prot ective c oil old s with a higher cont ent of carboxylic acid groups ar e, however, 1 ess pr ef err ed, in particular if they ar e produc ed by means of free radical polymerisati on. Thus, the c ont ent of monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids and their anhydrides   should   be  less   than   50mole%,   preferably  less<br><br>
than     25mole%     and     in     particular     less     than     10mole%. Wat er-soluble     organic     polymeric     prot active    colloids consisting   of   aromatic   sulphonic   acid   c ondensat es   ar e, mor eover,   also  less   pr ef erred.<br>
The weight ratio of the organic corrponent to the water-soluble organic polymeric prot active colloid depends above all on the rmt erials us ed and the affects to be achi eved. It may be approxi mat ely95: 5to5: 95, in particular approxinat ely 90 : 10 to 10 : 90 and pr ef erably approxi mat ely 80 : 20 to 20 : 80 and particularly pref erably approxirrat ely 70 : 30 to 30 : 70,<br>
The pH of the powder redispersible in water amounts, as 10% aqueous redispersion, t ypically to approxi mat ely 4.5 to 10,5, preferably approximately 5.0 to 9,5, but can in special cases such the addition of highly acidic or   alkaline components,   also  be  outside this   range.<br>
The inventive powder redispersible in water may also contain further additives. The cont ent of additives, based   on  the sum total   of   the  organic   corrponent   and  the<br>
wat er-soluble organic polymeric prot ective colloid is<br>
subject to no critical limits. Thus, it may be very low<br>
and lie within the framework of approximately 0,01% by<br>
weight or more, in particular approximately 0.1% by<br>
weight and preferably approximately 1% by weight in the<br>

500 parts and preferably approximately 100 parts of further additives can be added per one part of the inventive powder  redispersible in  water.<br>
There are no limits regarding the type of the further additives. As a rule, they play an irrportant part in the application of the powder according to the invention, but this is not essential* It is quite possibl e to add further organic polymeric prot ective colloids, the addition preferably taking place in the form of   a  powder   in  this   case.<br>

The invention relates also to a process for the' production of powders r edispersible in water, in particular for the production of the powders according to the invention, the organic corrponents being dispersed and stabilised, in a first step, with the wat er-soluble organic polymeric prot active colloid in wat er and the dispersion thus obtain ed being subsequently dried.<br><br>

In principle, all organosilicon compounds can be used as silanes, si lane est ers, silicones and/or siloxanes. However, it is advantageous, though not essential, if they are present in the liquid form and the boiling point of the organosilicon corrpounds is not too low at nor rrel pressure, pr ef erably appr oxi net ely 100° C or more.

Methyl hydrogen polysiloxanes end blocked by trimethyl siloxy groups, mixed polymers end blocked by trimethyl siloxy groups of dimethyl siloxane units and methyl hydrogen siloxane units and dimethyl polysiloxanes exhibiting in the terminal units a Si-bonded hydroxy1 group are also particularly preferred.<br>
In order to disperse the organic component with the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid in water, average to strong shear forces are usually advantageous and often also necessary. It can take place batchwise, continuously, e.g. via static mixers, or semi-continuously both at room temperature and at elevated temperature. If the organic component has an elevated melting point and is not dissolved, in this process, in another liquid substance the dispersion can also take place at temperatures of more than 100°C, the operation then preferably taking place at elevated pressure. In order to avoid partial or complete decomposition of the organic component, it is also possible to operate under a protective gas atmosphere, where required.<br>
During the dispersion of the organic component in the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, it is possible by the targeted adjustment of the different parameters, to vary in particular the particle size of the dispersion obtained. This includes the type and quantity  of  the  water-soluble  organic  polymeric<br><br>
protective colloid. In the case of a very small particle size, a highly efficient distribution of the matrix used is achieved even with extremely small quantities, If the particle size is larger, the redispersed material develops its effect over a longer period* It is consequently frequently preferred to have a multi-modal particle size distribution at hand in order to have at hand both a high efficiency and a long-lasting effect, Thus, the average particle size of the particles dispersed in the dispersion may typically be between approximately 0.05 and SO^im, in particular between approximately 0*1 and 20 pm and preferably between approximately 1 and 10 jam, it being necessary to ensure that the particle size is not too large, particularly in the case of low viscosity dispersions, in order to prevent sedimentation. This is of less importance in the case of dispersions of higher viscosity.<br>
Regarding the solids content of the dispersion of organic components stabilised with the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, the invention is subject to no critical limits at all. However, it is advantageous, as a rule, if the solids content is approximately 10 to 75% by weight, in particular approximately 25 to 65% by weight and preferably approximately 4 0 to 55% by weight. The dispersion obtained moreover typically has a Brookfield viscosity at 23^C, measured at 23°C and 20rpm according to DIN 53019, of approximately 100 to 50,O0OmPas, in particular approximately 500 to 25,000mPas and preferably approximately 1000 to 10,OOOmPas.<br>
Drying of the aqueous dispersion obtained preferably takes place by spray drying, freeze drying, fluid bed drying, drum drying and/or high speed drying, spray drying  being  particularly  preferred  and  it  being<br><br>
possible for spraying to take place by means of a spray wheels a single or multiple substance nozzle. Where required, the aqueous solution can in addition be diluted with water in order to obtain a viscosity suitable for drying. There are basically no particular limits regarding the drying temperature. However, particularly for safety considerations, it should, as a rule, not exceed approximately 200 '^C, in particular 17 5 '^C, In order to achieve sufficiently efficient drying, temperatures of approximately llC^C or higher, in particular approximately 12 0'C or higher, are preferred,<br>
The invention also relates to the process described, the drying step being omitted. The dispersion thus obtained is then processed in the liquid state, which is of relevance in particular in 2-component systems and industrial processing systems, such as in concrete.<br>
The process according to the invention also involves the addition of further additives which, depending on the type and/or the process technology possibilities, are, as an example, initially mixed with the organic component and/or with the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, added to the aqueous dispersion obtained and/or admixed, as powder, during and/or after drying to the powder obtained. However, liquid additives can also be sprayed onto the powder during or after drying. Preferably, the liquid and/or water-soluble additives are added before, during or after dispersion and additives in powder form are preferably mixed during or after drying of the powder obtained. Preferred liquid and/or water-soluble additives are silanes, silane esters, siloxanes, fatty acids and/or their derivatives, wetting agents, defearning agents, control agents for cement hydration and/or  for  adjusting  the  rheology  such  as  setting<br><br>
retarders^ setting accelerators^ cement superplasticisers, cement thickeners, air entrainers and/or film-forming aqueous polymeric dispersions based on emulsion polymers. Preferred additives in powder form consist of fillers, antleaking agents, film-forming dispersion powders redispersible in water based on emulsion polymers, polysaccharide ethers such as e.g. cellulose ether, starch ether and/or guar ether, control agents for cement hydration and/or rheology such as setting retarders, setting accelerators, cement superplasticisers and cement thickeners, air entrainers, cellulose fibres, dispersion agents, polyacrylamides, polycarboxylate ethers, hydrophobing agents in powder form, in particular based on silanes, silane esters and/or siloxanes, thickening agents, fillers such as carbonates, silicates, metakaolins and/or latent hydraulic components. The proportion of such additives can be very small, e.g. for interface-active substances and be within the region of approximately 0.01% by weight or more, in particular approximately 0.1% by weight and preferably approximately 1% by weight, based on the proportion of additive according to the invention. For other additives, such as fillers or film-forming dispersion powders redispersible in water based on emulsion polymers, this may amount to as much as approximately 1000 parts, in particular approximately 500 parts and preferably approximately 100 parts, based on one part by weight of the sum total of the organic component and the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid.<br>
A special embodiment is a process in which the aqueous dispersion obtained is dried jointly with the film-forming aqueous polymeric dispersion based on emulsion polymers, film-forming dispersion powders redispersible in water being obtained which greatly reduce the efflorescence in hydraulically set systems and, where<br><br>
required, prevent it completely. In addition, the aqueous dispersion may, where required, be added also to other dispersions to be dried, in particular those for rendering the hydraulically set compounds hydrophobic, e.g. to dispersions based on silanes, silane esters, siloxanes, silicones, fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters, after drying hydrophobing agents in powder redispersible in water being obtained form, which greatly reduce the efflorescence in hydraulically set systems and, where required, prevent it completely. In this connection, it is possible to mix the dispersion to be dried with each before drying and to spray and dry them jointly or to spray them separately simultaneously via a two-substance or multiple-sub stance nozzle and to dry them subsequently simultaneously with each other. If the other dispersion to be dried contains a sufficiently high proportion of water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid such that free protective colloid is still available, the organic component may be dried also jointly with the other dispersion as an emulsifier-stabilised dispersion. The weight ratio of the organic component to free protective colloid must be at least approximately 95 : 5, preferably at least approximately 90 : 10, However, it is of advantage if the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid used for the production of the aqueous polymeric dispersion and for the production of film-forming dispersion powder redispersible in water is also selected in such a way that the content of monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids as well as their anhydrides is less than 50 mole%. Moreover, aromatic sulphonic acid condensates are also less preferred. The ratio of the two dispersions to be dried may be adjusted at random in line with the effect to be achieved. Thus, the proportion of solids in the dispersion according to the invention based on the powder dried jointly, may be<br><br>
approximately 0,1 to 99% by weight, preferably approximately 1 to 95% by weight and in particular approximately 5 to 80% by weight•<br>
The powder redispersible in water which is obtained typically exhibits a high level of wettability and redispersibility in water. Ideally, it redisperses on mere contact with water within a few seconds, if need be as a result of light stirring. In certain cases, it is also possible for somewhat stronger shear forces to be necessary. In any case, the shear forces occurring during normally executed mixing processes for dry mortars are as a rule sufficient to completely redisperse the powder according to the invention and to achieve a homogeneous distribution in the matrix to be redispersed. During this process, the particle size of the aqueous dispersion is obtained again before drying.<br>
In addition, the invention also relates to the use of a powder redispersible in water in hydraulically setting systems for the reduction of efflorescence in hydraulically set systems based on at least one organic component and at least one water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid and, where required, other additives. The organic component contains at least one compound with a cyclic group which is completely or partially saturated and has a melting point of approximately -20 to 250^^0 and a molecular weight of approximately 100 to 10,000, the organic component being a terpeneoid, an resin acid, colophony, terpene resin, terpene-phenol resin and/or their derivative and forming a stable dispersion in water with the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid. The weight ratio of the organic component to the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid is approximately 95 : 5 to 5 : 95. In addition, 0 to approximately 1000 parts by weight, based on one part<br><br>
by weight of the sum total of the organic component and the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid^-at least one film-forming dispersion powder redispersible in water based on a film-forming dispersion and/or further additives may be contained therein.<br>
The invention moreover relates also to the use of an aqueous dispersion, produced according to the process described above, in hydraulically setting systems for the reduction of efflorescence in hydraulically set systems based on at least one organic component and at least one water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid and, where required, further additives. The aqueous dispersion produced, based on 100 parts by weight of the sum total of the organic component and the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, is based on approximately 5 to 95 parts by weight, preferably approximately 10 to 90 parts by weight, in particular approximately 20 to 80 parts by weight, of at least one organic component which contains preferably colophony, abietic acid, sylvic acid, neoabietic acid, levopinaric acid, pimaric acid, isopimaric acid and/or palustric acid and/or their derivatives, based on approximately 5 to 95 parts by weight, preferably approximately 10 to 90 parts by weight, in particular approximately 20 to 80 parts by weight of at least one water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, this representing at least one modified and/or unmodified polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of hydrolysis of approximately 70 to 100 mole%, in particular of approximately 80 to 98 mole% and a Hoppler viscosity as 4% aqueous solution of approximately 1 to SOmPas, in particular of approximately 3 to 40mPas (measured at 20°C according to DIN 53015) and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and/or approximately 20 to 90 parts by weight,  preferably<br><br>
approximately 25 to 90 parts by weight, of water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid, this representing at least one natural and/or synthetically produced biopolymer, which, where required, is synthetically modified and is in particular starch, starch ether, dextrins, cellulose ether, casein and/or soya protein, In addition, 0 to approximately 500 parts by weight, preferably 0 to approximately 250 parts by weight, of at least one silane component and/or siloxane component as well as 0 to approximately 10,000 parts by weight, preferably approximately 0 to 2000 parts by weight of a film-forming aqueous polymeric dispersion, based on 100 parts by weight of the sum total of the organic component and the water-soluble organic polymeric protective colloid respectively may be contained therein. The proportion of solids of the aqueous dispersion is between approximately 10 and 7 0% by weight, in particular between approximately 2 5 and 65% by weight and preferably between approximately 4 0 and 55% by weight, the average particle size of the dispersed particles is between approximately 0.05 and 50pm, in particular between approximately 0.1 and 20 pm and preferably between approximately 1 and 10pm and the Brookfield viscosity amounts to approximately 100 to 50,000mPas and preferably approximately 250 to 25,000mPas and in particular approximately 500 to 10,OOOmPas,<br>
The inventive powder redispersible in water and the non-dried aqueous dispersion are preferably used in hydraulically setting compounds, in particular in concretes and dry mortars. Such dry mortar formulations contain, apart from the powder according to the invention, in particular at least one hydraulically setting binder and typically further mortar formulation additives, such as e,g, fillers such as sand, silicates and/or carbonates, organic binders such as film-forming<br><br>
dispersion powders redispersible in water based on emulsion polymers and/or polyvinyl alcohol, rheology control additives such as polysaccharide ether, casein, superplasticisers and/or thickeners and/or hydration control additives such as accelerators and/or retarders. The hydraulically setting binder is Portland cement, e.g. according to EN 196 CEM, I, II, III, IV and V, calcium sulphate in the form of a-hemi-hydrate and/or (3 ^hemi-hydrate and/or anhydrite, high alumina cement and/or lime, usually in the form of calcium hydroxide and/or calcium oxide. Portland cement, high alumina cement and/or calcium sulphate are preferred. The proportion of powder according to the invention is in this case 0.01 to 25% by weight, in particular approximately 0.1 to 10% by weight and preferably approximately 0.2 to 5% by weight, based on the hydraulically setting binder. If the non-dried aqueous dispersion is used, it can be added to the hydraulically setting formulation either as such and/or together with liquid polymer dispersions and/or other liquid additives either together with the mixing water or separately.<br>
The dry mortars containing the powder according to the invention are preferably used where the applied and dried mortars may come into more or less regular contact with water• Apart from typical applications in the open air such e.g. thermal insulation mortars, sealing compounds, gypsum- and/or lime and/or cement plasters, spray and/or repair mojrtars, spray and/or repair concretes as well as polymer cement concretes (PCC) and/or polymer cement spray concretes (S-PCC), these consist of tile grout adhesives, plywood mortars, bonding agent mortars, cementitious parquet adhesives, cement sizings, tile adhesives, levelling and/or trowelling compounds. In addition, the powders according to the invention and the non-dried aqueous<br><br>
dispersions can be used as concrete additive and/or as additive for a protective coating on concrete.<br>
In this respect, it is highly advantageous for the powder according to the invention and the dispersion according to the invention, apart from greatly reducing efflorescence, to behave in a rheology neutral manner in the hydraulically setting systems and in the quantities used, in particular if synthetic stabilising systems are employed. Moreover, the setting behaviour of the hydraulically setting system is influenced either not at all or only insignificantly. The good mixing behaviour, good wettability and easy processability of the mortar and concrete are also of great importance. Moreover, the hydrophobicity is also improved in many cases, which, as a rule, is a welcome additional effect•<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to use the powder according to the invention and/or the aqueous dispersion produced according to the process described in adhesives* In this case, it is particularly advantageous to use the powder in powder adhesives, in particular in cases where a high cohesion is desired as early as during the early drying phase.<br>
The invention is explained by way of the following examples.<br>

EXAMPLE 10: PRODUCTION OF DISPERSION 1<br>
lOg of abietic acid (Fluka) were dissolved in 20g of spirit of turpentine (Fluka). A slightly viscous and slightly turbid solution was obtained.

B) TECHNICAL APPLICATION TESTS USING DIFFERENT<br>
CEMENTITIOUS COMPOUNDS<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE 1:<br>
35-0 parts of white Portland cement, 19,2 parts of quartz sand (0,08-0.2mm), 41.0 parts of calcium carbonate Durcal 65,  0,3 parts of a cellulose ether<br>
(viscosity as 2% aqueous solution: 3200mPas), 2.0 parts of the pigment Bayferrox 110 and 1.0 parts of construction lime were thoroughly mixed and used as basic dry mortar formulation. To this, different powders were added in varying quantities as shown in table 1, which could be stirred simply into the mortar matrix without further special mixing processes. The formulations were mixed in each case with 32 parts of water, based on 100 parts of dry formulation, using a 60mm propeller stirrer operating at a rate 950 rpm for 60 seconds, the quantity of mixing water indicated being added with stirring. After a maturing time of 3 minutes, the mortar was briefly stirred again by hand and applied by means of a serrated trowel onto an stoneware tile of a thickness of 6mm to an area of<br>
(196mm x 50mm), the tiles having been saturated with water immediately beforehand. Two different samples were produced in each case,  the mortar having been<br><br>
applied by means of spacer rails in a layer thickness of 2.2mm (1.0mm respectively).<br>
The test specimens were subsequently mounted immediately to a container with water in a climatic chamber cooled to 7°C^ the water being warmed to a constant 20'^C. The container was designed in such a way that the test specimens were lying at least 5cm above the water surface and had an inclination at an angle of 45"" . The surface area not covered by the test specimens was covered and isolated such that water vapour penetrates through the carrier material into and through the test specimens. After a storage period of 7 days, the surface was assessed optically for efflorescence (eye and microscope) *TABLE 1: Technical application examples using a pigmented cementitious trowelling compound with a thickness of 2,2mm for assessing efflorescence. The mortar processability was good in the case of all the specimens and the mortar consistency comparable to the reference respectively.<br><br><br><br>
a)	'P" represents powder, 'D" dispersion.<br>
b)	In the case of powders, the quantity used relates to the quantity of powder employed, in the case of dispersions to the solids content of the dispersion,<br>
c)	Elotex SealSO is a redispersible hydrophobing agent<br>
based on a special silane and polyvinyl alcohols<br>
The results clearly show that all colophony-containing specimens suppressed the efflorescence so strongly or even eliminated them completely such that none could be observed even under the microscope. The reference specimens, on the other hand, exhibited very strong efflorescence.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE 2:<br>
Samples produced in a manner analogous to those of the application example 1 were stored for 7 days at 23'C and a relative humidity of 50%. To assess the hydrophobicity, the time was subsequently determined, which passed until 5 drops of water (approximately 0.2g) had disappeared from the surface.<br><br>
TABLE 2: Technical application examples using a pigmented cementitious trowelling compound in a layer thickness of 2.2mm for assessing hydrophobicity,<br><br>
a), b), c): compare Table 1.<br>
The data in Table 2 show the excellent hydrophobing properties of Elotex SealSO^ although this provides no or only a slight reduction of efflorescence (compare other examples) . The powders according to the invention, on the other hand, exhibit also a good mortar hydrophobicity with a rising proportion,- apart from a strong reduction of the efflorescence, Powder 5 containing stearic acid, which is well known to be a hydrophobing agent, however, exhibits neither hydrophobicity nor a reduction of the efflorescence.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE 3:<br>
Application example 1 was repeated, the layer thickness being adjusted to 1.0mm,<br><br>
TABLE 3: Technical application examples using a pigmented cementitious trowelling compound with a thickness of 1,0mm for assessing efflorescence.<br><br>
a), b), c): compare Table 1,<br>
The results show a clear reduction in efflorescence also in thinly applied mortars insofar as a powder according to the invention or a dispersion to the invention is used. Powder 4 in experiment No B-13 clearly shows also that the powder according to the invention can also be added to film-forming dispersion powders  redispersible  in  water  based  on  emulsion<br><br>
polymers,  for example,  and can be used as such i r. mixture.<br><br><br><br>
a), b), c): compare Table 1.<br>
The results listed demonstrate that the strong reduction of the efflorescence occurs also in a decorative pigmented render.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE 5:<br>
40.0 parts of white Portland cement, 3 parts of aluminate cement/ 50.0 parts of quartz sand 0.1-0-3mm, 2 parts of a hydrophobic, film-forming dispersion powder redispersible in water and based on an emulsion polymers (Elotex WS45), 1 part of cellulose fibre, 0.10 parts of tartaric acid and 2,0 parts of the pigment Bayferrox 110 and 1.0 part of construction lime were thoroughly mixed and used as basic dry mortar formulation. The formulations were mixed with 22 parts of water, based on 100 parts of dry formulation, in each case, and tested in a manner analogous to application example 1.<br>
TABLE 5: Technical application examples using a joint mortar in a layer thickness of 2.0mm for assessing efflorescence. The mortar processability was equally good in the case of all specimens and the mortar consistency comparable to the reference in each case.<br><br><br><br>
a), b), c): compare Table 1,<br>
The results listed demonstrate that the strong reduction of the efflorescence occurs also in a joint mortar.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE 6:<br>
32,0 parts of white Portland cement, 1 part of aluminate cement, 65.0 parts of quartz sand (0-0.2mm), 0,35 parts of calcium sulphate, 0.75 parts of a hydrophobic, film-forming dispersion powder redispersible in water and based on an emulsion polymers (Elotex HD1501), 0.25 parts of a superplasticisers based on melamine sulphonate, 0.1 part of a defearning agent in powder form, 0,5 parts of black iron oxide and 0.05 parts of a cellulose ether (viscosity as 2% aqueous solution: 4000mPas) were thoroughly mixed and used as basic dry mortar formulation. The formulations were mixed with 17.5 parts of water, based on 100 parts of dry formulation, in each case, and tested in a manner analogous to application example 1.<br>
TABLE 6: Technical application examples using a j oint mortar in a layer thickness of 2,0mm for assessing efflorescence. The mortar processability was equally<br><br>
good in the case of all specimens and the mortar consistency comparable to the reference in each case.<br><br>
a),   b) r   c): compare Table 1.<br>
The results listed demonstrate that the strong reduction or even the total prevention of efflorescence occurs not only in different joint mortars, but also in a wide varieties of different mortars. Surprisingly enough, only a very small proportion of these additives is used for this purpose, which has no or only a very minor effect on the other mortar properties - be it in fresh mortar or in the set state.<br>
Although the colophony used is classified as a hazardous substance, the hazards potential is reduced by the encapsulation of the colophony with polyvinyl alcohol. Moreover, handling usually causes essentially fewer problems since the powder is free-'f lowing and consequently conveying, metering and mixing can be carried out without major effort and often be automated.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
