In a further embodiment of the present invention, horizontal alignment of the piercing roller is fixed with respect to the pressure roller having continuous vertical cavities and discrete cavities.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, horizontal alignment of the p iercing roller is variable with respect to the pressure roller having continuous horizontal cavity.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the horizontal length of the pressure roller is less than or equal to or greater than the length of the piercing roller.<br><br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the needles of piercing roller will pierce the surface of wrapper and then penetrate into open empty space of cavities of pressure roller.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the non-cavity area on the pressure roller provides sufficient surface contact between the wrapper and the pressure roller.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the pressure roller is designed' iri such a way that the wrapper gets sufficient grip resulting into effective piercing of wrapper without getting inserted into open empty space of cavities of pressure roller.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the non-cavity area can be rugged or smooth.<br>
In a further e mbodiment of the present invention, the cavities are in the form of square, rectangular, semicircle, semi ellipse or a triangle.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the size of the cavity is at least equal to 55% the length of the needle.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the depth of penetration of the needle inside the cavity is at least equal to 50% of length of the needle.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the pressure roller is designed in such a way that the needles of the piercing roller do not require frequent replacement.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the pressure roller is designed in such a way that the needles penetrate very easily through the wrapper without applying significant pressure for piercing.<br>
The concept of designing the pressure roller, having cavities on periphery having following advantages and disadvantages.<br>
The advantage of the continuous Horizontal cavity:<br>
1.	Horizontal alignment of the piercing roller can be variable with respect to pressure roller.<br>
2.	Piercing roller does not require precise alignment with pressure roller.<br><br><br>
3.	If we increase the length of pressure roller and make it greater than the piercing roller in which the cavities are being along with the length of pressure roller then at a single time two or more piercing rollers can aligned with a single pressure roller and two or more wrapping strip can be feed separately between these two or more sets of rollers arrangement simultaneously piercing operation performed rapidly and which further enhance the per day production.<br>
4.	Width of the wrapper being cut can be varied by varying the horizontal distance between two adjacent needles.<br>
The disadvantage of the continuous horizontal cavity:<br>
1.	The wrapper does not get sufficient non cavity area for holding the wrapper and performing the accurate piercing.<br>
2.	Piercing roller need to be operating synchronously with the pressure roller.<br>
The advantage of the continuous Vertical cavity:<br>
1.	Piercing roller need not be operating synchronously with the pressure roller.<br>
2.	The peripheral distance between two adjacent needles can be varied.<br>
3.	The length of the wrapper cut can be varied by varying the peripheral distance between two adjacent needles.<br>
The disadvantage of the continuous Vertical cavity:<br>
1.   Piercing roller require precise alignment with pressure roller.<br>
The advantage of the discrete cavity:<br>
1.	Maximum non-cavity area for holding the wrapper is available.<br>
2.	Accurate piercing of the wrapper is possible.<br>
3.	Due to the availability of sufficient non-cavity area, lesser pressure is required for the needles of the piercing roller to pierce the wrapper.<br>
The disadvantage of the discrete cavity:<br>
1.	Piercing roller require precise alignment with pressure roller.<br>
2.	Piercing roller must be operated synchronously with the pressure roller.<br>
The concept of designing the pressure roller having cavities on periphery will do the following functions.<br><br><br>
1.	The needles of piercing roller will pierce the surface of wrapper and then penetrate<br>
into open empty space of cavities of pressure roller. The piercing rollers needles must<br>
not come in contact with the base part and side edges of the cavities. So in order to<br>
avoid this contact between the piercing needles and cavities, the cavities formed are<br>
wide and deep enough preferably at least equal to 55% of the length and width of the<br>
needle and the depth of penetration of the needle inside the cavity is at least equal to<br>
50% of the length of the needle.<br>
This clearance not only avoid the contact between the piercing needles and cavities, but also enhances the effectiveness of piercing operation, life of piercing needles and the retain the size shape of the cavities and there is no need to replace the piercing needle or the pressure roller frequently because there would be no chance of loosing sharpness of piercing needles or discontinuous shape of the cavities. If this clearance is not available here then it may cause sever problems like<br>
a)	Over sizing of cavities: - due to this problem the shape of cavities will become deform at the outer edges, which will reduce the tension needed to hold the wrapping paper and affect the quality of pierced wrapper.<br>
b)	The sharpness of piercing needles may get disrupt which further effect the quality and the speed of cutting and increase the time and cost involvement in cutting and subsequently arises the requirement of frequent replacement of piercing needles.<br><br>
2.	Since, there is sufficient surface contact area of non cavity material of pressure roller, the wrapper gets sufficient grip resulting in effective piercing of wrapper without getting inserted into open empty space of cavities of pressure roller. In the absence of sufficient surface contact area between the wrapping paper and pressure roller it is very difficult impossible to pierce the wrapping paper even if the wrapper is pierced proper shape is not obtained.<br>
3.	The sufficient grip of the wrapper depends on both non cavity area and the surface condition of non cavity area. The surface conditions of the non cavity area can be either highly smooth or rugged or an optimum combination of both.<br>
If the surface conditions of the non cavity area is highly smooth, then wrapper get slipped from the pressure roller.<br>
If the non cavity area is highly rugged then wrapper get impression of the rugged surface and the printing matter on the wrapper and appearance of the wrapping paper get disrupt.<br><br><br>
So in order to get proper piercing one should have optimum balance between the smoothness and roughness of one non cavity area.<br>
4. Because there is no material in the cavities of pressure roller, the needles penetrate very easily without need of any significant pressure for piercing of the wrapper. The cavity can be in any suitable shape such as square, rectangular, semicircle, semi ellipse or triangle, for piercing operation. The size and shape of cavity depends on the size and shape of the piercing needles. However, the applicants have found that the cavities which have the shape of triangle or semi ellipse provides the best results.<br>
Figure 2 shows the device of the present invention wherein continuous vertical cavities are formed on the periphery of the pressure roller.<br>
Figure 3 shows another embodiment of the present invention, wherein discrete cavities are formed on the periphery of the pressure roller at locations corresponding to the locations where needles are formed on the piercing roller.<br>
Figure 4 represents the pressure roller of the invention wherein continuous horizontal cavities are formed on outer periphery of the pressure roller.<br>
Figure 5 represents the different shape of cavities on the pressure roller.<br>
Advantages of the present Invention:<br>
1.	Very effective piercing is achieved.<br>
2.	The needles of piercing roller do not have to penetrate the material of pressure roller for piercing the wrapper.<br>
3.	The pressure required for piercing operation is very less.<br>
4.	The material of pressure roller does not get damaged because there is no penetration of needles.<br>
5.	Pressure roller does not require to be replaced.<br><br><br>
