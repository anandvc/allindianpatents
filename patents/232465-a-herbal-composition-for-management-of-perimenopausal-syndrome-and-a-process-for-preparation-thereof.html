				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a herbal composition for management of perimenopausal<br>
e	im [[[|[||	ir[i	"" •	    •••        • "	""	"   "—		'<br>
syndrome and a process for the preparation thereof wherein the composition has the application for management of peri-menopausal syndrome to minimize the severity of the associated symptoms in menopausal phase among the women. The composition of the present invention may also be advantageously used in reducing the vasomotor instability and psychological symptoms found to be more pronounced among menopausal syndrome-cases.<br>
Background of the Invention :<br>
Irregular menstrual cycles commonly precede the menopause and hence the exact timing of it can be recognized in retrospect (i.e. 6 months after last period). The condition of peri-menopause is referred to as that period of time around the menopause when ovarian function is erractic, with partial gonadol failure occurring in 2-3 years transitional phase during which reproduction ceases. This is a time of decreasing fertility, decreasing plasma estrogen levels and the appearance of typical symptoms of the menopausal syndrome although, of course the menstrual period will still be present. In some patients they are relatively minor but in others a major problem. The most common symptoms like vasomotor instability and certain behavioural problems particularly anxiety and depression are significantly associated with perimenopausal syndrome. The hot flushes may start when the patient still has regular periods.<br>
The fall in estrogen secretion is associated with increased bone re-absorption. There is an initial rapid loss of bone mass which eventually results in osteoporosis. Giving estrogen is referred as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but it should not be given for long-term as it has a variety of adverse effects.<br>
Objects of the present invention.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and a process for the preparation thereof useful for the management of perimenopausal symptoms by modifying the psychological disturbances as well as regulating the vasomotor instability.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and a process for the preparation thereof useful for the management of behavioural problems like irritability, hyperexcitability among perimenopausal women.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and a process for the preparation thereof useful for the management of vasomotor instability like hot flushes among the perimenopausal women.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition<br>
and a process for the preparation thereof for minimizing the rapid loss<br>
of bone mass and thus delay the severe osteoporetic chanages in<br>
future.<br>
Description of Invention;<br>
According to this invention there is provided a herbal composition for management of perimenopausal syndrome and a process for the preparation thereof comprising of :<br>
extract of dried roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra<br>

Nordostachy Jatamansi	150-SOOmg<br>
Hypericum perforatum	300 - 600mg<br>
The remainder is optionally known additive to make the required preparation.<br>
Glycyrrhiza glabra (Madhuyeshti):<br>
This plant commonly known as 'Madhuyeshti' belonging to family "Papilionaceae" whose dried roots are extracted to collect the mixture of saponin (glycyrrjiiginj/Triterpene (glycyrrhetic acid) compounds. Various studies have suggested that this plant possessing anti^uyTammatoiy activity Drug is also useful for strengthening muscte__and__bone_in various clinical conditions,<br>
Bambusa arundinacea (Vansh):<br>
.,.^-_,.-,.&gt;--.	..-.,.	^	^<br>
This plant is commonly known as Vansh' belonging to family "Gramineae" whose dried leaves are extracted to collect the mixture of the plant. It has been speculated that this plant has estrogen like action and as such it is helpful in the management of the symptoms observed in<br>
Nardostachys jatamansi (Jatamansi):<br>
This plant is commonly known as 'Jatamansi' belonging to family "Valerianaceae" whose dried rhizomes are extracted to collect the mixture<br>
of jatarnansone, terpene, esterol compounds^ Several studies have shown tn^uilizing, hypotensive and uplifting of mental function properties^<br>
liypericum perforatum (Basant):<br>
This plant is commonly  known as Basant belonging to family "Clusiaccac" whose dried leaves re extracted to collect the mixture of tiyperdn   and      various  studies  this  drug particularly the hypercm and hypcrforin has shown miti-stress^ana\anti_ depressan t jpropertie£._,<br>

Example-10:<br>
The  preparation  containing  the  organic  extract  of Glycyrrhiza<br>
-H"' """	"	""	•	'	--	•--,<br>
glabra in the dose of 250mg, Bambusa arundinacea in the dose 150mg,<br>
Nordostachy jatamansi in the dose of 200mg and Hypericum perforatum in the dose of 400mg an overall improvement in the clinical symptomatology was noticed among perimenopausal women after three months therapy. The vasomotor instability particularly hot flushes reduced, anxiety and depression improved significantly and also the<br>
i<br>
general feeling of well being were reported by almost all the perimenopausal cases.<br>
rimenopausal syndrome is the condition which involves a group of psychological and physiological changes are reflected at behavioural as well as biological level particularly changes brought about in decline in female hormones. No single drug therapy can reduce the symptom complex observed in such females. The present formulation reduces the complications of menopausal syndrome and hence it improves the quality of life of female of the menopausal women. Vasomotor instability is the most important symptoms of menopausal females therefore the role of Nordostachys jatamansi is significant in reducing the CNS overacttvity_among such females. Bambusa arundinacea has shown estrog^njike,^^^^,^]!1^11^ earlier studies and hence it is effective in the management of rapid decline in the female hormone particularly the estradiol. Hypericum perforatum which has anti-depressant property regulates the mood of<br>
depressive menopausal women. Glycyrrhiza glabra prevents the rapid declines in the bone matrix and thus it minimizes the rapid qsteoporetic changes among the menopausal women.<br>
Single drug is not sufficient to overcome all the above prominent symptoms associated with peri-menopausal/menopausal women.<br>
ation comprises the organic extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Madhu-yesti), Nordostachys jatamansi (Jatamanshi) and Hypricum perforatum (Basant) in prescribed doses as described herein. When these mixtures were added in the formulation it modifies various complaints found among peri-menopausal women. The mixture was prepared in a specific dose, which showed the regulation of various complaints associated with peri-menopausal syndrome. If a single drug like Nordostachys jatamansi is administered it only controls the one aspect of present syndrome. While this clinical condition has a multiple complaints. The effective dose was determined by evaluating trial and error method. The novelty of this formulation is the proportion of the biologically active ingredients of the organic extract of the above four plants.<br>
Calcium sulphate was used as an additive to make the final capsule.<br><br><br><br>
