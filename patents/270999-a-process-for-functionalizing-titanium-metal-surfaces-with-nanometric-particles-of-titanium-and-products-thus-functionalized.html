A PROCESS FOR   TITANIUM METAL SURFACES WITH<br>
NANOMETRIC     PARTICLES    OF    TITANIUM     AND     PRODUCTS     THUS<br>
FUNCTIONALIZED<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of titanium metal surface treatment.<br>
State of tile art<br>
In recent times titanium has been widely utilized in the manufacture of parts used<br>
in implantology (particularly in the orthodontic field).  In view of this use, the ability<br>
of the surfaces of the various constituent parts of such implants to perform a<br>
bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic action is evidently important.<br>
Italian patent application FI2004A000252 (in the name of the same applicant)<br>
describes a process for preparing titanium oxide in nanoparticle form and the<br>
relative dispersions obtained by said process, consisting of nanometric particles of<br>
titanium oxide suspended in a mixture of water and a suitable complexing solvent<br>
(such as polyethylene glycol). The aforesaid patent application also mentions the<br>
usefulness of said suspensions for preparing photocatalytic coatings.<br>
Similarly, Italian patent FI2006A000030 describes a process for preparing titanium<br>
oxide in nanoparticle form in an aqueous dispersion and the relative dispersions<br>
themselves.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention  refers to a process for functionalizing titanium  metal<br>
surfaces with nanometric particles of titanium wherein:<br>
-	the article to be functionalized is immersed in a suspension of nanometric particles of titanium dioxide;<br>
-	when completely wetted the article is heated to remove the solvent;<br>
-	the article is subjected to a thermal cycle in order to improve fixing of the nanoparticles to the treated surface.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
it has now been surprisingly found that dispersions of nanometric particles of titanium oxide as described in the aforesaid patent applications lend themselves in particular to the treatment of titanium surfaces, enabling them to exert a bactericidal or bacteriostatic action which is found to be extremely useful and<br><br>
interesting in the case of prostheses, or parts thereof, particularly orthodontic parts<br>
formed of this metal.<br>
As is more amply illustrated in patent application FI2004A000252 the process for<br>
preparing dispersions of anatase TiOa particles usable in the present invention,<br>
comprises the following stages:<br>
i) reacting a titanium alkoxide with a suitable complexing solvent;<br>
ii) distilling the solution derived from step i) until a small quantity results;<br>
iii)  adding  water together with  said  complexing  solvent  and  one  or  more<br>
polycondensation inhibitors to the solution derived from step ii), then heating the<br>
reaction mixture under reflux, to obtain the desired nanoparticulate dispersion.<br>
The titanium alkoxide is preferably chosen from the group consisting of titanium<br>
methoxide,   ethoxide,   normal-propoxide,   isopropoxide,   normal-butoxide,   and<br>
isobutoxide, being preferably titanium isopropoxide.<br>
The complexing solvents typically used in the present process are polyethylene<br>
glycols, having molecular weights for example of between 200 and 600.   Longer<br>
chain polyethylene glycols of molecular weight up to 10,000 can also be used,<br>
diethylene glycol being preferred.<br>
The term "polycondensation inhibitor" means typically a mixture comprising at<br>
least one mineral acid and one organic acid, where the mineral acid can be<br>
chosen for example from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,<br>
sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydriodic acid, and the organic<br>
acid is preferably acetic acid; the polycondensation inhibitor is preferably a mixture<br>
of hydrochloric acid and acetic acid.<br>
The quantity of polycondensation inhibitor added is such that the mineral acid<br>
quantity is between 0.1 and 10% by volume on the total volume of the reaction<br>
mixture, while the organic acid quantity is between 1 and 20% by volume on the<br>
total volume of the reaction mixture.<br>
The aforesaid patent application FI2006A000Q30 also amply illustrates and claims<br>
a process for preparing dispersions of anatase TiOa particles in water.<br>
According to this process a titanium salt is reacted in water under hot conditions in<br>
the presence of mineral acids and a non-ionic surfactant, the solution thus<br>
obtained being then possibly reduced to a small quantity.   Both the general and<br><br>
preferred definitions of titanium salt and mineral acid, already aforegiven for the<br>
process  of patent application  FI2004A00025,  are  valid,  whereas  "non-ionic<br>
surfactants" mean those possessing an ether or ester type polar function, being<br>
preferably Triton X-1 GO (TX-1 GO).<br>
The molar ratio of titanium alkoxide to acid is between 0.005 and 15, preferably<br>
between 5 and 6, while the reaction temperature is normally between 15 and 95°C<br>
preferably 45-55°C^and the reaction times are between 12 and 72 hours, being<br>
preferably 24 hours.<br>
Furthermore, as described in both applications, in both the above cases Ti can be<br>
doped with a metal chosen from the transition metal series and particularly from<br>
Ag, Cu and Ce by the addition a salt thereto in step i) or alternatively in step iii) of<br>
the present process.   In this manner, the process will lead to the formation of a<br>
TiOa dispersion doped with Ag, Cu or Ce, able to exhibit its own catalytic activity<br>
even without UV light irradiation.<br>
An  illustrative example for preparing  the suspensions  used  in  the  present<br>
invention both comprising the complexing agent and in aqueous suspension<br>
(examples   already   given   in   the   aforesaid   patent   applications)   are   given<br>
hereinafter.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Preparation of a nanoparticulate dispersion of anatase TiO? in water/diethylene<br>
glycol starting from Ti isopropoxide<br>
Example 1<br>
5.53 litres of diethylene glycol are fed into a 20 litre flask to which are added 5.54<br>
litres of titanium isopropoxide.  The reaction mixture is maintained under agitation<br>
for 5 minutes then heated to 120°C to distil off the isopropyl alcohol formed, until a<br>
small quantity results.     11.1   litres of diethylene glycol,  125  ml  of 32-33%<br>
hydrochloric acid (w/w), 2.07 litres of glacial acetic acid and 125 ml of deionized<br>
water are added; the temperature is brought to 180°C and the mixture maintained<br>
under reflux for 2 hours.<br>
Example 2<br>
5 g of concentrated HCI, 75 g of TX-100 and water to make up to 750 g in weight<br>
are placed into a 2 litre reactor heated with circulating diathermic oil in an external<br><br>
jacket.   The temperature is brought to 50°C.   50 g of Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 (TIP) are<br>
then added very quickly and the formation of a white flocculate precipitate is<br>
immediately noted.<br>
After 7 hours a very stable transparent sol is formed.<br>
The suspensions thus obtained are then used to functionaiize the surface of<br>
titanium metal parts.<br>
In particular the article to be functionalized is immersed in the suspension and<br>
possibly rotated so as to completely wet the surface therewith.   It is then heated<br>
and finally subjected to  a thermal cycle in  order to  improve the fixing of<br>
nanoparticles onto the treated surface.<br>
The suspensions used for the initial bath generally contain from 0.1% to 15%,<br>
preferably 1%, of nanometric titanium dioxide, and possibly from 0.005% to 0.5%,<br>
preferably 0.05%, of silver, the percentages being calculated by weight on the<br>
solution.   The sole function of the initial heating is to accelerate solvent removal<br>
and can be undertaken for example in an oven at around 120°C.<br>
The subsequent thermal cycle comprises an increasing temperature gradient<br>
between  0.1   and   10°C/minute  starting  from  ambient temperature  up to  a<br>
temperature of between 400° and 850°C which is maintained for a time between<br>
30 and 240 minutes, the treated article being allowed to cool 6ovm freely to<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
The process in accordance with the present invention can be undertaken on<br>
ground surfaces but, if preferred, the surface can be subjected to mordanting in<br>
accordance  with   normally   employed  techniques  for  this   purpose,   prior  to<br>
immersion in the titanium dioxide suspension.<br>
Some examples are described  hereinafter for treating  a titanium  article in<br>
accordance with the invention with the aim of attributing thereto the desired<br>
bactericidal properties.<br>
Example 3<br>
A titanium screw for orthodontic implants was subjected to mordanting with<br>
mixtures of acids (a known process in the state of the art) in order to obtain a<br>
structured non-smooth surface.  This was immersed into a formulated product in<br>
diethylene glycol containing 1% by weight of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide and<br><br>
kept under rotation for 5 seconds.<br>
The screw was then placed in an oven at 120°C for 1 hour in order to promote<br>
solvent evaporation.   In this step the titanium dioxide nanoparticles deposit onto<br>
the surface of the screw. The screw is then treated at high temperature to stably<br>
fix the nanoparticles to the metal.  The thermal cycle consists of a heating ramp<br>
up to 650°C lasting 2 hours, a plateau of 2 hours, then free cooling to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Example 4<br>
A ground titanium screw for orthodontic implants was immersed in a formulated<br>
product in  diethylene glycol containing  nanoparticulate silver adsorbed onto<br>
nanoparticulate titanium dioxide for a total content of 1% of titanium dioxide and<br>
0.05% of nanoparticulate silver and kept under rotation for 5 seconds.<br>
The scr-ew was then placed in an oven at 120°C for 1 hour in order to promote<br>
solvent evaporation.   In this step the titanium dioxide nanoparticles deposit onto<br>
the surface of the screw. The screw is then treated at high temperature to stably<br>
fix the nanoparticles to the metal.  The thermal cycle consists of a heating ramp<br>
up to 650°C lasting 2 hours, a plateau of 2 hours, then free cooling to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Example 5<br>
A  mordanted  titanium   screw for orthodontic  implants  was  immersed  in   a<br>
formulated  product  in water containing  nanoparticulate silver adsorbed onto<br>
nanoparticulate titanium dioxide for a total content of 0.1 % of titanium dioxide and<br>
0.005% of nanoparticulate silver and kept under rotation for 5 seconds.<br>
The screw was then placed in an oven at 120°C for 1 hour in order to promote<br>
solvent evaporation.   In this step the titanium dioxide nanoparticles deposit onto<br>
the surface of the screw. The screw is then treated at high temperature to stably<br>
fix the nanoparticles to the metal.  The thermal cycle consists of a heating ramp<br>
up to 750°C lasting 2 hours, a plateau of 2 hours, then free cooling to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Example 6<br>
An aqueous solution of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide containing 1% by weight<br>
of the oxide was sprayed onto one side of a small smooth titanium plate.   The<br><br>
small plate is dried in an oven at 120°C for 1 hour in order to promote solvent evaporation. The small plate is then treated at high temperature to fix the nanoparticles to the metal. The thermal cycle consists of a heating ramp up to 800°C lasting 2 hours, a plateau of 2 hours, then free cooling to ambient temperature.<br><br><br>
