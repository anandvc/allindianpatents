				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to refrigerators, and more particularly, to a refrigerator with a cabinet having a mullion wall for compartmentalization of a freezing chamber and a refrigerating chamber and an icemaker of an improved structure, which can dispense ice pieces from a dispenser provided to a refrigerator door.<br>
Background of Related Art<br>
The refrigerator is used for long time fresh storage of food. The refrigerator has food storage chambers each of which temperature is maintained in a low temperature state by a refrigerating cycle, for fresh storage of the food.<br>
There are a plurality of storage chambers of different characteristics, so that the user can select storage methods suitable for storage of various kinds of food, taking kinds and characteristics of food and required storage time periods into account. Of the storage chambers, the refrigerating chamber and the freezing chamber are typical.<br>
The refrigerating chamber is maintained at about 3°C~ 4°C for long time fresh storage of food and vegetable, and the freezing chamber is maintained at a subzero temperature for long time storage of meat and fish in a frozen state, and making and storage of ice pieces. In general, the refrigerating chamber has a volume greater than the freezing chamber, and the freezing chamber is allocated over the refrigerating chamber.<br>
In the meantime, recently, other than the foregoing traditional functions of the refrigerator, the refrigerator has been developed to have a variety of additional functions. For an example, for drinking cold water in the refrigerating chamber, in the related art, the user is required to open the door, and take out a water bottle from the refrigerating chamber.<br><br>
However, recently, a refrigerator provided with a water dispenser to an outside of a refrigerator door is developed, for dispensing cold water cooled down by cold air in the refrigerating chamber, enabling the user supplied with, and drink the cold water at outside of the refrigerator without opening the door.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In describing the embodiments, same parts will be given the same names and reference symbols, and repetitive description of which will be omitted.<br>
Referring to FIG 1, though the related art refrigerator has a refrigerating chamber in a lower part thereof and a freezing chamber in an upper part thereof, the refrigerator of the present invention has a freezing chamber 2 in a lower part thereof and a refrigerating chamber 1 in an upper part thereof.<br>
Referring to FIG 1, the refrigerator of the present invention includes a refrigerating chamber 1 in an upper part of the refrigerator, and a freezing chamber 2 in a lower part of the refrigerator. There is a door la in a front part of the refrigerating chamber 1, with a water dispenser 3 provided thereto. The water dispenser 3 enables the user to be supplied with cold water directly at an outside of the refrigerator without opening the door la. For this, there is a water tank (not shown) on an inside surface of the door la in contact with the refrigerating chamber 1. The water tank stores water, and the water in the water tank is cooled by the cold<br>
air in the refrigerating chamber 1. According to this, when the user operates the lever (not shown), the user can be supplied with the cold water from the water tank through the water dispenser3.<br>
Thus, the refrigerator is the refrigerating chamber 1 positioned in the upper part thereof, and the freezing chamber 2 positioned in the lower part thereof. Therefore, the water dispenser 3 can be provided at a waist or breast height of the user. According to mis, the user can use the water dispenser 3 very easily and conveniently.<br>
In the meantime, the refrigerator of the present invention is provided, not only with the water dispenser 3 for supplying cold water, but also an icemaker 10 for producing and supplying a plurality of ice pieces. The icemaker 10 will be described in more detail with reference to the attached drawings. For reference, FIGS. 2 and FIG 3 illustrate an icemaker and an ice container provided to the refrigerator in FIG 1, and FIG 4 illustrates a diagram showing operations of them.<br>
The icemaker 10 and the ice container 20 are provided to the freezing chamber 2 under the refrigerating chamber 2.<br>
Referring to FIG 2, the icemaker 10 includes an ice tray 11, a water supplying part 12, an ejector 14, and a motor 13. As shown in FIG 2, the ice tray 11 has a semi-cylindrical form with an opened top, for storing water or ice therein. There are a plurality of ribs 1 la on an inside surface to divide an inside space thereof into a plurality of spaces. As shown in FIG 2, the ribs Ha are projected in a radial direction, and enable the ice tray 11 to produce a plurality of ice pieces.<br>
As shown in FIG 2, the water supplying part 12, provided to one side of the ice tray 11, supplies water to the ice tray 11. As shown in FIG 2, there is a bracket 15 at a rear side of the ice tray 11, for fastening the icemaker 10 to the freezing chamber 2.<br>
In the meantime, the ejector 14 includes a shaft 14a, and a plurality of pins 14b. As shown<br>
in FIG. 2, the shaft 14a is arranged to cross a center of an upper part of the ice tray 11 in a longitudinal direction. As shown in FIG 2, the pins 14b are formed on an outside circumferential surface of the shaft 14a substantially perpendicular to the shaft 14a. It is preferable that the pins 14b are formed at regular intervals along a length direction of the shaft 14a, more preferably, one for each of the spaces in the ice tray 11 divided with the ribs lla.<br>
As shown in FIG 2, the motor 13 is mounted on one point of an outside circumferential surface of the ice tray 11, and is connected to a shaft 14a. According to this, when the shaft 14a rotates by the motor 13, the pins 14b rotate together with the shaft 14a. Then, the pin 14b pushes the ice pieces in the ice tray 11 out to drop the ice pieces below the icemaker 10.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, there are a plurality of strips 16 in a front part of the ice tray 11, i.e., in an upper part of a side opposite to a side the brackets 15 are arranged. The strips 16 are extended from the upper part of the front side of the ice tray 11 to a part close to the shaft 14a, respectively. There is a gap between adjacent strips 16, through which the pins 14b pass when the shaft 14a rotates.<br>
In the meantime, the ice pieces in the ice tray 11 are pushed by the pins 14b, separated from the ice tray 11, and drop on the strips 16 after the ice pieces are separated from the ice tray 11, fully. The ice pieces 16 dropped on the strips 16 are dropped below the icemaker 10, and stored in the ice container 20 under the icemaker 10. According to this, top surfaces of the strips 16 are required to guide the ice pieces separated from the ice tray 11, to drop below the icemaker 10, well. Therefore, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, in the present invention, it is preferable that the strips 16 are sloped such that parts near to the shaft 14a are higher than the front part of the ice tray 11.<br>
A structure is also required for preventing the ice pieces separated from the ice tray 11 by the pins 14b from dropping to a rear side of the ice tray 11. For this, as shown in FIGS. 2 and<br>
4, in the present invention, it is preferable that a rear side end of the ice tray 11 is higher than the shaft 14a, so that the ice pieces moved backward, and separated from the ice tray 11 by the ice tray 11 are guided to a front side of the ice tray 11, and drop on the strips 16, naturally.<br>
In the meantime, referring to FIG 4, there is a heater on an underside of the ice tray 11. The heater 17 heats a surface of the ice tray 11 for a short time period, and melts the ice pieces on a surface of the ice tray 11, slightly. According to this, the ice in the ice tray 11 can be separated easily when the shaft 14a and the pins 14b rotate.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and 4, the icemaker 10 is provided with a sensing arm for measuring an amount of ice in the ice container 20. The sensing arm, under the control of a controller (not shown), moves and measures the amount of ice in the ice container 20. For an example, the sensing arm 18 moves down at regular intervals, to move down much when the amount of the ice in the container 20 is small, and opposite to this, to move down little when the amount of the ice in the container 20 is much as the sensing arm 18 hits the ice earlier. According to this, the controller measures the amount of ice in the ice container 20 with reference to a move down depth of the sensing arm 18.<br>
In the meantime, referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the container 20 is arranged below the icemaker 10, and has an opened top for receiving, and storing the ice pieces from the icemaker 10. As shown in FIG 3, the ice container 20 has a discharge opening 21 in one surface, for an example, in a bottom surface for discharging ice pieces downward.<br>
In the meantime, the ice container 20 has a transfer device 22 for transferring the ice pieces in the ice container 20 to a side having the discharge opening 21 formed therein. As shown in FIG 3, the transfer device 22 has a form of a thread, arranged across the ice container 20. The transfer device 22 is connected to a motor 23, and rotated, to transfer the ice pieces in the ice container 20 toward the discharge opening 21.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, inside of the ice container 20, there is a crusher 30 in a side part<br>
having the discharge opening 21 formed therein for crushing the ice transferred by the transfer device 22. The crusher 30 includes a housing 31, a shaft 32, a supporter 33, and blades 34.<br>
The housing 31, over the discharge opening 21 in the ice container 20, has an opened side in a side facing the transfer device 22.<br>
The shaft 32 is arranged in the housing 31 horizontally, and connected to, and rotate together with, the transfer device 22. The shaft 32 may be fabricated separate from the transfer device 22, and connected to the transfer device 22, or, as shown in FIG 3, fabricated in a form extended from an end of the transfer device 22.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, the supporter 33 is provided to support the shaft 32 in the housing 31. That is, since the shaft 32 passes the supporter 33, the shaft 32 rotates in the housing 31 together with the transfer device 22.<br>
The blades 34, fixed to the shaft, rotates together with the shaft 32, and crushes the ice pieces transferred by the transfer device 22. At least one blade 34 is provided, and, as shown in FIG 3, when there are a plurality of blades 34, it is preferable that the blades 34 are arranged opposite to each other with respect to the supporter 33.<br>
Once the icemaker 10 and the ice container 20 are provided to the freezing chamber 2, a plurality of ice pieces produced from the icemaker 10 is stored in the ice container 20. According to this, without requiring separation of the ice pieces from the ice tray, the user may open the door 2a on the freezing chamber 2, and take out the ice pieces from the ice container 20, which is convenient to the user. However, in this case, it is still not convenient, since opening of the door 2a is required, and frequent opening of the door 2a causes waste of energy, still.<br>
Therefore, though not shown in FIG 1, an ice dispenser may be provided to the door 2a on the freezing chamber 2 of the refrigerator of the present invention. In this instance, the ice<br>
dispenser, provided separate from the water dispenser 3, supplies the ice pieces produced in the icemaker 10 and stored in the ice container 20 to the user.<br>
To do this, it is preferable that an ice discharging device 40 is provided to the ice container 20, for discharging an appropriate amount of ice, selectively. As shown in FIG 3, the ice discharging device 40 includes an actuator 42, and a shutter 41.<br>
The shutter 41, substantially in a plate form, provided to open/close the discharge opening 21. The shutter 41 is connected to the actuator 42, with, for an example, a lever (not shown). As the actuator, for an example, an actuator of a solenoid type may be used.<br>
In the foregoing ice discharging device 40, the actuator 42 is operative in response to a control signal from the controller, and the shutter 41 regulates an amount of opening of the discharging device 21 according to operation of the actuator 42.<br>
In the meantime, in the present invention, it is preferable that the ice discharging device 40 provided thus can discharge the ice crushed at the crusher 30, or the ice stored in the ice container 20, selectively.<br>
To do this, as shown in FIG 3, the discharge opening 21 may include a first discharge opening 21a and a second discharge opening 21b, and the shutter 41 is arranged to open the second discharge opening 21b selectively. As shown in FIG. 3, the first discharge opening 21 a is formed under the crusher 30, and the second discharge opening 21b is formed under an end part of the transfer device 22 on a side of the crusher 30.<br>
Once the discharge opening 21 and the ice discharging device 40 have the forgoing structures, the ice discharging device 40 can discharge crushed, or uncrushed ice selectively, which will be described in more detail.<br>
If the user desired to have crushed ice supplied thereto, the second discharge opening 21 b is closed with the shutter 41. Then, the ice pieces in the ice container 20 is transferred to the crusher 30 by the transfer device 22, and the ice crushed at the crusher 30 is discharged<br>
through the opened first discharge opening 2la.<br>
On the other hand, if the user desires the uncrushed ice, the shutter 41 opens the second discharge opening 21b. Then, the ice stored in the ice container is discharged through the second discharge opening 21 b before the ice is transferred to the crusher 30. According to this, the user can have the uncrushed ice supplied thereto.<br>
In the meantime, the structure in which the crushed or uncrushed ice can be supplied selectively is not limited to above structure. For an example, one discharge opening may be provided, and one shutter regulates an amount of opening of the discharge opening. That is, when the shutter opens the discharge opening slightly, the ice is discharged after being crushed at the crusher 30, and when the shutter opens the discharge opening fully, the ice is discharged as it is without being crushed.<br>
The operation of the refrigerator of the present invention will be described.<br>
If the controller (not shown) determines that there is shortage of ice in the ice container 20 by the operation of the sensing arm 18, water is supplied to the water supplying part 12 in the ice container 10. The water supplied to the water supplying part 12 in turn fills the spaces between the ribs lla of the ice tray 11, are frozen by the cold air in the freezing chamber 2. Accordingly, the ice tray 11 can produce the ice pieces of fixed sizes by the ribs lla.<br>
When the ice is formed as a preset time is passed, the heater 17 heats the ice tray 11 for a short while. According to this, the ice on the surface of the ice tray 11 melts slightly, and separated from the ice tray 11. Then, as the motor 13 is put into operation, the shaft 14a and the pins 14b rotate. Then, the pin 14b pushes out the ice between adjacent ribs lla in a circumferential direction of the ice tray 11 until the ice, separated from the ice tray 11 folly by the pin 14b, drops onto the strip 16, therefrom, below the icemaker 10, and received at the ice container 20.<br>
When a preset amount of ice is stuffed in the ice container 20 by repeating above process,<br><br>
the controller stops production of the ice as the sensing arm senses the amount of the ice. Of course, if the sensing arm 18 senses that there is shortage of the ice still, the foregoing process is repeated to produce ice continuously, which is stored in the ice container 20.<br>
In the meantime, when the user operates a control panel on an outside surface of the door 2a, in a state the ice is stuffed in the ice container 20, the user can have the crushed, or uncrushed ice supplied thereto through the ice dispenser, which process will be described, hereafter.<br>
When the user operates the control panel, to select a function for having the crushed ice supplied thereto, as described before, the shutter 41 closes the second discharge opening 21b a little, or opens the discharge opening 21, a little. Under this state, the motor 23 is rotated, to transfer large sized ice from the ice container 20 to the crusher 30. Then, the ice in the ice container 20 is transferred to the crusher 30, entirely. According to this, the ice crushed in the crusher 30 is discharged through the first discharge opening 21a. Thereafter, the discharged ice is supplied to the user through the ice dispenser.<br>
On the other hand, if the user selects a function for having large sized uncrushed ice supplied thereto by operating the control panel, the shutter 41 opens the second discharge opening 21b, or the discharge opening 21, almost fully. Then, the ice transferred to the crusher 30 by the transfer device 22 is discharged through the discharge opening 21 before the ice reaches to the crusher 30, and supplied to the user through the ice dispenser.<br>
Thus, the refrigerator of the present invention can dispense crushed, or uncrushed ice selectively. However, the refrigerator of the present invention described with reference to <br>
Referring to FIGS. 5-9, there are a freezing chamber 52 in an upper part of the cabinet 50, and a refrigerating chamber 51 in a lower part of the cabinet 50. As shown in FIGS. 6-9, the refrigerating chamber 52 and the freezing chamber 51 are compartmentalized into independent spaces with a mullion wall 64.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 6-9, the freezing chamber 51 is provided with an evaporator 65. There is a fan adjacent to the evaporator 65. According to this, the cold air formed in the vicinity of the evaporator 65 is supplied to the freezing chamber 51 or the refrigerating chamber 52 by the fan 66.<br>
