				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A SYNTHETIC TANNING AGENT<br>
Filed of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a synthetic tanning agent. More particularly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a organo-polymeric substance, which is free from formaldehyde, using for tanning leather. This polymeric substance has enormous potential application as pretanning as well as retanning agent in leather processing industry.<br>
Background and Prior art references<br>
Synthetic tanning agents are conventionally prepared by the condensation of naphthalene/phenol sulphonic acid or urea with formaldehyde as reported by Sharphouse (Leather Technicians Handbook, Vernon Lock Ltd., London, 1983).<br>
As reported by Stille and Campbell (High Polymer, 27, 14, 1972), the phenol-formaldehyde condensed product, which is essentially a low molecular weight resinous material, has always a possibility of eliminating unreacted phenol or formaldehyde, thereby posing a risk of adding to toxicity.<br>
Denzinger et al (U.S. Patent 5,425,784, 1995) have prepared water-soluble graft polymers of monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and derivatives with crotonic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, citraconic acid, citraconic anhydride, C1 - C8 -alkyl- and hydroxyalkyl esters of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or crotonic acid, mono- and di-C1 - C8 -alkyl and -hydroxyalkyl esters of maleic acid, fumaric acid and citraconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, methacrolein, acrylamido-methylpropanesulfonic acid, N-vinylimidazole and mixtures, and used as a tanning agent for the self-tanning, pretanning, simultaneous tanning and retanning of pelts and skins. But these polymers do not produce leathers having fine grain, good fullness, affordable heat stability and uniform colour.<br>
Wehling et al (U.S. Patent 5,340,365, 1994) have used naphthalene sulphonic acid condensate in the production of chrome leathers. They have reported that this condensation product can be used for pretreatment of delimed and bated pelts. Even though the properties of the chrome tanned leathers do not differ from those of conventionally chrome tanned, the condensed product was prepared using formaldehyde,<br>
which on ageing may undergo photo oxidation and release formaldehyde which may pose occupational hazards (Suspected carcinogens: A sub life of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) substances list, 2nd ed. Washington DC: US Dept of Health, Education and Welfare NIOSH, 1976.)- Moreover the developed chrome tanning method is associated with release of chromium in the effluent beyond the stipulated limit (2 ppm as Cr) as reported by Buljan (World Leather, November, 65, 1996).<br>
Thus it is observed that even though the phenols and phenolic acid resins based on formaldehyde condensation have exhibited freedom of choice with respect to degree of crosslinking, molecular weight, particle size etc, the main limitations of using these polymeric condensates are the following.<br>
1.	They considerably lighten the color and when the amount used is too large, it will lead to a rubber-like handle of the leather.<br>
2.	The tanned leathers undergo photo oxidation due to the presence of active methylene bridge<br>
3.	Slow release of formaldehyde from the tanned leathers on ageing may pose hazardous environment.<br>
Current chrome tanning method poses severe problems due to its associated environmental problems. Industry has taken great pains to improve the chromium exhaustion. Prentiss and Sigafoos (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 70, 481, 1975) have reported that the use of poly acrylic and poly methacrylic acids in chrome tanning improves the chrome exhaustion. Lakshminarayana et al (Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, 85, 425, 1990) recommends an acrylic acid based syntan as retanning agent for chrome tanned leathers, which is prepared by the graft co-polymerization of acrylic ester and methacrylic acid onto a mixture of sulfated fish oil and alginic acid using free radical polymerization. But the major limitation associated with this product is that it leads to poor light fastness and heat resistance. Moreover, the acrylic syntans, which are generally attached to the protein through weak linkage, result in either low exhaustion in processing bath or more leaching out during subsequent wet operations.<br>
Christner et al (U.S. patent No 4,961,750, 1990) have reported the preparation of thio containing chromium poly acrylate tanning agents by complexing the chromium ion and an acrylate polymer together with a heterocycle containing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom, having a molecular weight between 200 and 30,000, which can be offered to pickled skins or hides. The main disadvantage in this tanning agent is the slow release of oxides of sulphur, which is carcinogenic.<br>
The above limitations have prompted the researchers to explore possibilities of incorporating metal ion onto a polymeric matrix to form a complex for using as tanning salt. Keeping in mind the toxic hazards caused by formaldehyde, attempts have been made to prepare synthetic tanning agent, which is free from formaldehyde, as reported by Suresh et al (Journal of Cleaner Production, 9, 483, 2001) and Thanikaivelan et al (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 97, 127, 2002), who have also demonstrated the use of a synthetic tanning agent based on complexation of chromium with acrylic polymer and sulfonated aromatic condensates in the presence of organic ligands for self-tanning of delimed pelts and retanning applications. The use of this product result in improved exhaustion of chromium when applied on delimed pelts and hence reduces the total dissolved solids in the effluent. The major limiting feature here is that the preparation of the syntan involves employing chromium salt for complexation, thereby giving rise to the problem of toxicity associated with chrome.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a synthetic tanning agent, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare a chromium exhaust aid, which can be offered to delimed pelts along with commercial BCS thus avoiding pickling process thereby reducing the total dissolved solids in the effluent.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to prepare a formaldehyde free polymeric network, which helps in preventing the precipitation of chromium at lower pH values.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to prepare a polymeric product, which can be used as a retanning agent and provides leathers with improved fullness, grain firmness with uniform dyeing.<br>

The contents of the flask were heated for 180 minutes at 40°C with constant stirring. A drop of the resulting mass was taken in a beaker and 2 ml of water was added to the beaker with shaking. A clear solution, without free naphthalene smell was obtained. This confirms the completion of sulfonation. The sulfonated mass was transferred to a reactor fitted with a thermometer, stirrer and a dropping funnel. The mass was stirred continuously for a period of 10 min while maintaining the temperature at 60°C. A mixture of 14 gms sodium citrate, 17 gms phthalic acid, 11 gms sodium formate in 70 ml of water was added to the above sulfonated mass and stirring was continued at 60°C.<br>
40 gms of polyacrylic acid was added to the sulphonic acid mixture and the mixture was heated to 80°C for 1 hour. A small portion of the reaction mixture was taken in a beaker and 2 ml water was added to the mass. The pH of the solution in the beaker was adjusted to 3.5 and a clear solution was obtained indicating the completion of the reaction. About<br>
1400 ml of water was added to the mass and transferred to a bucket after cooling the reaction mass to room temperature. The pH of the mass was raised to 3.5 by adding a solution of 140 gms of sodium hydroxide in 350 ml water, followed by the addition of an aqueous solution of 350 gms of sodium bicarbonate in 700 ml water. The slurry was filtered using a cloth of pore size 5-10u. The filtrate was drum dried at 130°C and the white powder was stored in a plastic container.<br>
