				<td>A VACCINE COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to a conjugate comprising an antibody and antigen wherein said<br>
conjugate has low antibody valency and including methods to prepare said conjugate.<br>
The immune system is made up of lymphocytes which are able to recognise specific<br>
antigens. B lymphocytes recognise antigens in their native conformation through<br>
surface immunoglobulin receptors, and T lymphocytes recognise protein antigens that<br>
are presented as peptides along with self molecules known as major<br>
histocompatibility antigen (MHC), or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans, on<br>
the surface of antigen presenting cells. Antigen presenting cells occur in different<br>
forms and may be distinguished into 'classical' antigen presenting cells, exemplified<br>
by macrophages and dendritic cells, and 'non-classical' antigen presenting cells,<br>
which includes B lymphocytes. T lymphocytes may be further subdivided into<br>
"cytotoxic T lymphocytes", which are able to kill virally infected target cells, and "T<br>
helper" lymphocytes. T helper lymphocytes have a regulatory function and are able<br>
to help B lymphocytes to produce specific antibody, or to help macrophages to kill<br>
intracellular pathogens.<br>
Antibodies may exist in several forms, for example there are the main classes: IgM,<br>
IgG, IgA, IgD and IgE, each with differing 'effector' functions whereby the effect of<br>
the antibody is determined. Effector functions include complement fixation,<br>
(resulting in the stimulation of inflammatory responses) which can be activated upon<br>
the formation of immune complexes of antigen and antibody by IgM, IgA and IgG.<br>
Another example of an effector function is the triggering of mast cells by antigen,<br>
which is brought about by the cross-linking of surface IgE on mast cells, tethered<br>
there by occupancy of the high-affinity receptor for IgE FcR-epsilon-I (a receptor for<br>
the Fc region of IgE). For some of the antibody classes there are subclasses, (e.g. IgG<br>
in man is composed of four different subclasses known as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and<br>
IgG4). The IgG subclasses differ markedly in abundance and in then effector<br>
functions.<br>
One of the most important developments in the history of medicine is the advent of<br>
vaccines which are used to protect against a wide variety of infectious diseases. There<br>
are also vaccines in development for the treatment of various non-infectious diseases<br>
such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases and various cancers. Many<br>
vaccines are produced by inactivated or attenuated pathogens which are injected into<br>
an individual. The immunised individual responds by producing both a humoral<br>
(antibody) and cellular (cytolytic T cells, CTL's) response. For example, some<br>
influenza vaccines are made by inactivating the virus by chemical treatment with<br>
formaldehyde, likewise the Salk polio vaccine comprises whole virus inactivated<br>
with propionolactone For many pathogens (particularly bacteria), chemical or heat<br>
inactivation, while it may give rise to vaccine immunogens that confer protective<br>
immunity, also gives rise to side effects such as fever and injection site reactions. In<br>
the case of bacteria, inactivated organisms tend to be so toxic that side effects have<br>
limited the application of such crude vaccine irnmunogens (e.g. the cellular pertussis<br>
vaccine). Many modern vaccines are therefore made from protective antigens of the<br>
pathogen, separated by purification or molecular cloning from the materials that give<br>
rise to side-effects. These latter vaccines are known as 'subunit vaccines'.<br>
The development of subunit vaccines (e.g. vaccines in which the immunogen is a<br>
purified protein) has been the focus of considerable research in recent years. The<br>
emergence of new pathogens (such as HIV and group-B streptococcus) and the<br>
growth of antibiotic resistance have created a need to develop new vaccines and to<br>
identify further candidate molecules useful in the development of subunit vaccines.<br>
Likewise the discovery of novel vaccine antigens from genomic and proteomic<br>
studies is enabling the development of new subunit vaccine candidates, particularly<br>
against bacterial pathogens and cancers. However, although subunit vaccines tend to<br>
avoid the side effects of killed or attenuated pathogen vaccines, their 'pure' status has<br>
separated from the 'danger signals' that are often associated with whole organism<br>
vaccines, and subunit vaccines do not always have adequate immunogenicity. Many<br>
candidate subunit vaccines have failed in clinical trials in recent years, that might<br>
otherwise have succeeded were a suitable adjuvant available to enhance the immune<br>
response to the purified antigen. An adjuvant is a substance or procedure which<br>
augments specific immune responses to antigens by modulating the activity of<br>
immune cells.<br>
We describe an adjuvant with improved efficacy. An adjuvant is a substance or<br>
procedure which augments specific immune responses to antigens by modulating the<br>
activity of immune cells. Examples of adjuvants include, by example only, Freunds<br>
adjuvant, muramyl dipeptides, liposomes. W097/38711 and US02/0136722<br>
discloses, amongst other things, CD28:antigen and CD40: antigen conjugates which<br>
act as adjuvants and result in enhanced immune responses directed to the antigen part<br>
of the conjugate.<br>
CD28/CD40:antigen conjugates can be produced in a number of ways, and utilising a<br>
number of possible cross-linkers. A number of cross-linkers and cross-linking<br>
methods are described in the catalogues of the Pierce Chemical Company Inc., and<br>
Molecular Probes Inc. Preferred methods of conjugation utilise so-called hetero-<br>
bifunctional cross-linkers, which have different functional groups at each end of the<br>
molecule, and thus their use can prevent direct antigen-antigen cross linking, or<br>
antibody-antibody cross-linking. However despite the advantages of these cross-<br>
linkers, in many cases conjugates can still be formed which contain more than one<br>
antibody molecule, and more than one antigen molecule.<br>
For example, if sulfo-SMCC and SATA are used as cross-linkers, one of the<br>
conjugate components is first maleimated using sulfoSMCC and the other has<br>
sulfhydryl groups attached using SATA. Both the maleimation and the sulfhydryl<br>
modification are on primary amines, of which there may be several on both the<br>
antibody and the antigen (ammo-terminal residues (4 on each Ig molecule), and any<br>
lysine residues). It is possible therefore for any antigen to be attached to more than<br>
one antibody molecule, and for any antibody molecule to be attached to more than<br>
one antigen molecule. In this way large, covalently linked, complexes of antibody<br>
and antigen can be formed. The complexes formed during conjugation can be.<br>
characterised using a number of different parameters:<br>
i) overall size of the conjugate (molecular weight);<br>
ii) ratio of antibody to antigen (weight:weight);<br>
iii) ratio of antibody to antigen (mole: mole);<br>
iv) mean number of antibody molecules in the conjugate; and<br>
v) mean number of antigen molecules in the conjugate.<br>
For any one antigen of known molecular weight, all of these parameters can be<br>
derived from (iv) and (v). However as antigens vary in size, the relationships<br>
between these values will vary, and thus the optimal forms of conjugates will vary<br>
between small (peptides), medium (proteins) and large (polysaccharide) antigens.<br>
From in vitro experiments it is known that signalling through both CD40 and CD28<br>
is enhanced by increasing the valency of the interaction. Thus, in order to achieve<br>
optimal B or T cell proliferation, anti-CD40 or anti-CD28 are adhered to the plastic<br>
of tissue culture plates prior to the addition of the cells, or are cross-linked through<br>
the use of anti-Fc antibodies adhered to the plastic, or even through the use of Fc<br>
receptor expressing cell lines, such as CD32 expressing L929 cells which are<br>
themselves adhered to the tissue culture plastic (Banchereau et al Science 1991 252<br>
70-72.). Surprisingly, we find that , unlike proliferation induction in vitro, the<br>
adjuvant effects of the antibodies are not enhanced by increased multivalency.<br>
Indeed, the adjuvant effects are diminished when either of the antibodies are in a<br>
multivalent state.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention there is provided an adjuvant comprising an<br>
isolated conjugate of a CD28 and/or CD40 antibody and at least one antigen, wherein<br>
said conjugate consists of an oligomeric complex wherein the antibody valency of the<br>
complex does not exceed an average of about five antibody molecules per complex.<br>
The formation of a "conjugate" is by any means which results in a conjugation<br>
crosslinking or association of antigen with antibody.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said complex consists an average of one<br>
to four antibody molecules per complex.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said complex consists an average<br>
of one to three antibody molecules per complex. Preferably one to two antibody<br>
molecules per complex.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a vaccine<br>
composition comprising a conjugate according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said composition further comprises a<br>
carrier.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said composition further<br>
comprises a second adjuvant.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said composition comprises a<br>
mixture of a CD40 conjugate and a CD28 conjugate as herein described.<br>
The term carrier are construed in the following manner. A carrier is an immunogenic<br>
molecule which, when bound to a second molecule augments immune responses to<br>
the latter. Some antigens are not intrinsically immunogenic (i.e. not immunogenic in<br>
their own right) yet may be capable of generating antibody responses when associated<br>
with a foreign protein molecule such as keyhole-limpet haemocyanin or tetanus<br>
toxoid. Such antigens contain B-cell epitopes but no T cell epitopes. The protein<br>
moiety of such a conjugate (the "carrier" protein) provides T-cell epitopes which<br>
stimulate helper T-cells that in turn stimulate antigen-specific B-cells to differentiate<br>
into plasma cells and produce antibody against the antigen. Helper T-cells can also<br>
stimulate other immune cells such as cytotoxic T-cells, and a carrier can fulfil an<br>
analogous role in generating cell-mediated immunity as well as antibodies. Certain<br>
antigens which lack T-cell epitopes, such as polymers with a repeating B-cell epitope<br>
(e.g. bacterial polysaccharides), are intrinsically immunogenic to a limited extent.<br>
These are known as T-independent antigens. Such antigens benefit from association<br>
with a carrier such as tetanus toxoid, under which circumstance they elicit much<br>
stronger antibody responses. Carrier conjugation of bacterial polysaccharides is used<br>
to produce a number of 'conjugate vaccines' against bacterial infections such as<br>
Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) and group-C meningococci.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is a T-cell dependent<br>
antigen.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is a T- cell<br>
independent antigen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is derived from a pathogenic<br>
bacterium.<br>
Preferably said antigen is derived from a bacterial species selected from the group<br>
consisting of: Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Enterococcus<br>
faecalis; Mycobacterium tuberculsis; Streptococcus group B; Streptoccocus<br>

Borrelia burgdorferi; Coccidiodes immitis; Histoplasma sapsulatum; Neisseria<br>
meningitidis; Shigella flexneri; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae.<br>

56); papovavirus; rhinovirus; poliovirus; herpesvirus; adenovirus; Epstein Batr virus;<br>
influenza virus, hepatitis B and C viruses.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, said antigen is derived from a<br>
parasitic pathogen.<br>

Lieshmania spp, Schistosoma spp or Plasmodium spp.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is derived from a<br>
fungal pathogen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is derived from a fungal<br>
pathogen which is of the genus Candida spp, preferably the species Candida<br>
albicans.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is a tumour specific<br>
antigen or a tumour associated antigen.<br>
In a yet preferred embodiment of the invention said antigen is an addictive drug.<br>
In further preferred embodiment of the invention said drug is selected from the group<br>
consisting of: cocaine; nicotine; or heroin.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method to<br>
immunise an animal to an antigen, comprising administering an effective amount of a<br>
conjugate according to the invention sufficient to stimulate an immune response to<br>
said antigen.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention said animal is human.<br>
In an alternative preferred method of the invention said animal is selected from the<br>
group consisting of: mouse; rat; hamster; goat; cow, horse, pig, dog, cat or sheep.<br>
In a further preferred method of the invention said immune response is the<br>
production of antibodies to said conjugate.<br>
In an alternative preferred method of the invention said immune response is the<br>
production of T-helper cells which recognise the antigen part of said conjugate.<br>
A preferred route of administration is intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or<br>
intranasal, however the immunisation method is not restricted to a particular mode of<br>
administration.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided an antibody<br>
obtainable by the method according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is a therapeutic antibody.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is a diagnostic<br>
antibody. Preferably said diagnostic antibody is provided with a label or tag.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said antibody is a monoclonal antibody or<br>
binding fragment thereof. Preferably said antibody is a humanised or chimeric<br>
antibody.<br>
A chimeric antibody is produced by recombinant methods to contain the variable<br>
region of an antibody with an invariant or constant region of a human antibody.<br>
A humanised antibody is produced by recombinant methods to combine the<br>
complementarity deterrnining regions (CDRs) of an antibody with both the constant<br>
(C) regions and the framework regions from the variable (V) regions of a human<br>
antibody.<br>
Chimeric antibodies are recombinant antibodies in which all of the V-regions of a<br>
mouse or rat antibody are combined with human antibody C-regions. Humanised<br>
antibodies are recombinant hybrid antibodies which fuse the complimentarity<br>
deterrnining regions from a rodent antibody V-region with the framework regions<br>
from the human antibody V-regions. The C-regions from the human antibody are also<br>
used. The complimentarity determining regions (CDRs) are the regions within the N-<br>
terminal domain of both the heavy and light chain of the antibody to where the<br>
majority of the variation of the V-region is restricted. These regions form loops at the<br>
surface of the antibody molecule. These loops provide the binding surface between<br>
the antibody and antigen.<br>
Antibodies from non-human animals provoke an immune response to the foreign<br>
antibody and its removal from the circulation. Both chimeric and humanised<br>
antibodies have reduced antigenicity when injected to a human subject because there<br>
is a reduced amount of rodent (i.e. foreign) antibody within the recombinant hybrid<br>
antibody, while the human antibody regions do not ellicit an immune response. This<br>
results in a weaker immune response and a decrease in the clearance of the antibody.<br>
This is clearly desirable when using therapeutic antibodies in the treatment of human<br>
diseases. Humanised antibodies are designed to have less "foreign" antibody regions<br>
and are therefore thought to be less immunogenic than chimeric antibodies.<br>
It is also possible to create single variable regions, so called single chain antibody<br>
variable region fragments (scFv's). If a hybridoma exists for a specific monoclonal<br>
antibody it is well within the knowledge of the skilled person to isolate scFv's from<br>
mRNA extracted from said hybridoma via RT PCR Alternatively, phage display<br>
screening can be undertaken to identify clones expressing scFv's. Alternatively said<br>
fragments are "domain antibody fragments". Domain antibodies are the smallest<br>
binding part of an antibody (approximately 13kDa). Examples of this technology is<br>
disclosed in US6,248, 516, US6,291,158, US6,127,197 and EP0368684 which are<br>
all incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antibodies are opsonic<br>
antibodies.<br>
Phagocytosis is mediated by macrophages and polymorphic leukocytes and involves<br>
the ingestion and digestion of micro-organisms, damaged or dead cells, cell debris,<br>
insoluble particles and activated clotting factors. Opsonins are agents which<br>
facilitate the phagocytosis of the above foreign bodies. Opsonic antibodies are<br>
therefore antibodies which provide the same function. Examples of opsonins are the<br>
Fc portion of an antibody or compliment C3. Antibodies raised by immunisation and<br>
in the form of an immune complex with antigen may bring about opsonisation via the<br>
fixation of complement on the antigen, or molecules in its immediate<br>
microenvironrnent.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for preparing a<br>
hybridoma cell-line producing monoclonal antibodies according to the invention<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
i) immunising an immunocompetent mammal with a conjugate,<br>
composition, nucleic acid or vector according to the invention;<br>
ii) fusing lymphocytes of the immunised immunocompetent mammal<br>
with myeloma cells to form hybridoma cells;<br>
iii) screening monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells of<br>
step (ii) for binding activity to the antigen of the conjugate according<br>
to the invention;<br>
iv) culturing the hybridoma cells to proliferate and/or to secrete said<br>
monoclonal antibody, and<br>
v) recovering the monoclonal antibody from the culture supernatant.<br>
Preferably, said immunocompetent mammal is a rodent, for example a mouse, rat or<br>
hamster.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a hybridoma cell-line<br>
obtainable by the method according to the invention.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method to crosslink<br>
an antibody, wherein said antibody is capable of binding a CD28 or CD40 receptor<br>
polypeptide and at least one antigen characterised in that reaction conditions are<br>
provided which select for conjugates with low antibody valency.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a method to<br>
prepare a conjugate according to the invention comprising fractionation of a<br>
conjugation reaction mixture.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention said fractionation comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
i) providing a reaction mixture consisting of a heterogeneous crosslinked<br>
antibody: antigen conjugate complex;<br>
ii) separating the reaction mixture into fractions containing conjugates of defined<br>
size; and optionally<br>
iii) isolating conjugates with a desired antibody valency.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention said fraction contains a conjugate complex<br>
with an antibody valency of about on average five antibody molecules per complex.<br>
In a further preferred method of the invention said fraction contains a complex with<br>
an antibody valency of between one to four antibodies per complex.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said fraction contains a<br>
complex with an antibody valency of between one and three antibodies per complex.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said fraction contains a complex<br>
of two antibody molecules, preferably said conjugate is a single antibody linked to at<br>
least one antigen.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention said method is selected from the group<br>
consisting of: a size exclusion chromatographic method; an affinity chromatographic<br>
method; a differential precipitation method.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be provided by example only and with<br>
reference to the following figures:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the effect of anti-CD40 antibody valency on primary anti-rat<br>
immune response; and<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the effect of increasing antibody valency on immune responses<br>
using an anti-CD40 antibody.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
The antibody valency of the conjugates can be varied in a very large number of ways,<br>
indeed there are a large number of possible ways to perform the conjugations which<br>
will be known to those skilled in the art. The following are included by way of<br>
example only.<br>
Alteration of the degree of derivatisation of the antigen.<br>
One means of cross-linking antigens with antibodies, is to maleimate the antigen, for<br>
instance using sulfo-SMCC, and subsequently to react the maleimated antigen with a<br>
thiolated antibody (antibody can be thiolated using SATA or SPDP.<br>
The degree of maleimation of the antigen can be altered by changing the relative<br>
concentrations of sulfo-SMCC (sulfo-succinimIdyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)<br>
cyclohexane-1 carboxylate) and antigen in the reaction.<br>
Another method of producing conjugates allows an accurate measurement of the<br>
degree of derivatisation of the antigen to be determined. The cross-linker SPDP<br>
(succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate) can be used to thiolate the antigen.<br>
SPDP reacts at pH 7-9 with an amine containing antigen, yielding a mixed disulfide.<br>
Subsequently, upon reduction with dithiothreitol, a 2-pyridinethione chromophore is<br>
released and a sulfhydryl group remains on the protein. From the amount of<br>
chromophore released (as determined by absorbance) it is possible to calculate the<br>
mean ratio of derivatisation on the antigen. Of course if this ratio were, for example,<br>
3 sulfhydryl groups per antigen molecule, the subsequent conjugates with sulfo-<br>
SMCC maleimated antibody could not possibly have an antibody valency greater<br>
than 3. Thus control of the degree of derivatisation and therefore the mean number of<br>
thiol residues per antigen molecule could limit the antibody valency of the<br>
conjugates.<br>
Another means of controlling valency would be to alter the number of reactive<br>
groups present in the antigen. Thus, for instance SPDP or SATA (among other cross-<br>
linkers) might be used to add sulfhydryl groups to the antigen. These cross-linkers<br>
both react with primary amines, therefore reaction can be with the ammo-terminal<br>
residue, or with lysine residues elsewhere in the protein. It is possible to remove<br>
some lysine residues from a recombinant antigen by site-directed mutagenesis. It<br>
would of course be possible to remove lysine residues from a peptide by altering the<br>
synthesis. Of course if the antigenic sequences were being altered it would be<br>
important to ascertain that important epitopes were not being removed by this<br>
procedure.<br>
Alteration of Antigen:antibody ratios in the reaction of the derivatised proteins<br>
The relative ratios of derivatised antigen, and antibody in the reaction mix can be<br>
altered, and will have effects on the kinds of conjugate formed which will also be<br>
dependent upon the degree of derivatisation and the relative sizes of the two<br>
components.<br>
Purification of conjugates of different sizes<br>
The conjugates produced can be purified by size fractionation. For example<br>
conjugates of glycoprotein D and antibody of between 200kDa and 400kDa could be<br>
separated from larger conjugates by gel filtration. Such conjugates could contain no<br>
more than two antibody molecules per conjugate (of approximately 150kDa each).<br>
An alternative method for purification of lower molecular weight conjugates would<br>
be to use sequential addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the conjugate mixture.<br>
Relatively low concentrations of PEG would be required to precipitate large<br>
conjugates, while increasing concentrations will precipitate conjugates of decreasing<br>
size. An alternative to PEG would be a salt such as Ammonium sulphate. Again,<br>
increasing concentrations of Ammonium sulfate will lead to the precipitation of<br>
gradually smaller proteins/conjugates. PEG of Ammonium sulfate can be<br>
subsequently removed from the re-dissolved precipitates by dialysis.<br>
An alternative method to select conjugates of low valency rather than small size,<br>
would be to deplete high valency conjugates by affinity chromatography on<br>
SepharoseCL4B bearing Fc-gamma-receptor-IIb extracellular domain. Only high<br>
valency conjugates will stick to the column, or alternatively under isocratic<br>
conditions of 0.15M NaCl pH 7.4 10mM Na Po4 buffer, the species will eIute in<br>
order of valency, i.e. low valency first (unadsorbed or weakly absorbed occurring in<br>
the Void volume' of the column or soon thereafter.<br>
Sizes of the purified conjugates can be assessed by gel filtration against known<br>
standards, or in some circumstances by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Activity<br>
of the conjugates must then also be determined, most importantly regarding retention<br>
of antibody binding to either CD40 or CD28, and retention of antigencity of the<br>
antigen indicating that epitopes are intact. One method to verify these tow activities<br>
would be to use Flow cytometric staining of CD40 or CD28 expressing cells.<br>
Conjugates are added to the cells in PBS and incubated for 30min on ice. Cells are<br>
then washed and an antibody (either monoclonal or polyclonal) against the antigen<br>
added for 30min on ice. The antibody is then detected using a fluorescently labelled<br>
second antibody. Only conjugates with antibody binding (to CD40 or CD28) and<br>
antigenic epitopes still intact will give positive staining, and will be ready for<br>
assessment of immunogenicity.<br>
Phage PEG precipitation/purification<br>
It is known that PEG at 15% will precipitate free IgG from serum. Therefore a lower<br>
concentration would be appropriate for complexes such as used to preciptitate<br>
immune complexes, or larger molecules such as phage virons below.<br>
1. add 30 ml of phage stock to SS-34 Oakridge tube.<br>
2. add 7.5 ml 20 % PEG-8000/2.5 M NaCl.<br>
3. incubate on ice for 30 minutes or longer.<br>
4. spin down phage @ 11K for 20 minutes.<br>
5. respin 2-3x to remove all of PEG solution (using a micro-pipet tip<br>
facilitates removal of all solution).<br>
6. resuspend phage in STE (500-1000 ul).<br>
7. transfer to eppendorf and spin @ 14K for 10 minutes.<br>
8. transfer supernatant to new eppendorf and label.<br>
9. titer phage.<br>
STE: for 100 ml add 1 ml 1 M Tris (pH 8), 0.2 ml 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8), 2 ml<br>
5 M NaCl. Autoclave.<br>
PEG: for 100 ml add 20 gm PEG-8000 and 14.6 gm NaCl, filter sterilize.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Rat (IgG2a) anti-mouse CD40 induces a strongly enhanced immune response in mice<br>
against rat IgG2a in comparison with control rat IgG2a. In order to assess the effects<br>
of anti-CD40 valency on the adjuvant effect, irnmunogens of different CD40<br>
antibody valencies were produced as follows.<br>
a. Anti-CD40 antibody or isotype control antibody alone was used as<br>
immunogen, valency of one CD40 antibody per "conjugate" (Monomeric)<br>
b. Anti-CD40 or isotype control antibodies were cross linked with anti-rat Ig<br>
antibody, to give a valency of two CD40 antibodies per conjugate (dimeric)<br>
c. Anti-CD40 or isotype control antibodies were cross-linked with biotinylated<br>
anti-rat Ig, and avidin, to give a multimeric conjugate (multimeric)<br>
In order to ensure that each mouse was immunised with the equivalent mixture of<br>
antigens, control proteins were added into the irnmunogens, such that the<br>
irnmunogens comprised of the following:<br>
a) 10ug CD40 or isotype control mAb, 10ug mouse IgG and 5ug avidin<br>
b) 10ug CD40 or isotype control, mab, 10ug mouse anti rat IgG and 5ug<br>
avidin<br>
c) 10ug CD40 or isotype contro, mab, 10ug biotinylated mouse anti rat<br>
IgG and 5ug avidin.<br>
Groups of 5 BALB/c female mice were immunised intraperitoneally, and 10 days<br>
later were bled and serum assayed for anti-rat IgG2a responses by ELISA as<br>
described previously (Barr et al. Immunology 109 87-91, 2003). Briefly, 96 well<br>
ELISA plates were coated overnight with rat IgG2a (GL117) at 10ug/ml in PBS at<br>
4oC. The following day plates were blocked with 1% fish gelatin in PBS and washed<br>
with PBS/0.05% Tween. Serial dilutions of sera were made, and after incubation for<br>
1h at room temperature, and washing, conjugate (horse radish peroxidase labelled<br>
goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins, multiadsorbed (Sigma) was added to wells, and<br>
the plates incubated for a further hour. Plates were then washed again, and incubated<br>
with substrate (OPD, Sigma) for 15 minutes and read at 490nm. Titres are expressed<br>
as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which test serum gave a higher OD<br>
then normal mouse serum. Results are shown in Figure 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Increasing valency of the conjugates reduces the antibody response. Keyhole limpet<br>
hemacyanin (Sigma) was derivatised with SPDP (Molecular probes, using protocols<br>
provided by Molecular probes) and the sulfhydryl groups deprotected by reduction<br>
with dithiothreitol, followed by dialysis. Anti-CD40 or isotype control antibody were<br>
meleimated using sulfo-SMCC (Molecular probes, using proteocols provided by<br>
Molecular probes), and the derivatised proteins mixed together to form conjugates as<br>
follows:<br>
A) 100% anti-CD40 antibody (5mg antibody to 1mg KLH)<br>
B) 10% anti-CD40, 90% isotype control antibody (5mg antibody to lmg KLH)<br>
C) 1% anti-CD40, 99% isotype control antibody (5mg antibody to lmg KLH<br>
This protocol was designed to produce conjugates of the same size and antigen<br>
content, but with different CD40 antibody valencies.<br>
Groups of 3 BALB/c female mice were immunised intraperitoneally, and 10 days<br>
later were bled and serum assayed for anti-KLH responses by ELISA as described<br>
