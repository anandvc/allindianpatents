				<td>the description that the coextrusion of more than two films is not excluded, but it is not known what films these are. In addition, in this technique the polyethylene film cannot be used as a film in itself and it must be recycled because it does not contain the necessary additives, such as antioxidants and UV stabilizers. If these additives are added thereto, the process, whose essential purpose is to produce a film of the semicrystalline polymer, is complicated. It is therefore desirable to reduce this thickness of the polyethylene film in order to reduce the amount that has to be recycled.<br>
It has now been found that it is possible to produce, using the tube blow extrusion process, a film comprising a layer of fluoropolymer and a layer of another polymer (A), these two layers being adjacent, and a third layer of an incompatible polymer placed either on the same side as the fluoropolymer or on the same side as the polymer (A). The polymer (A) may be any polymer, for example an amorphous polymer, that is to say it is not necessary semicrystalline, and the thickness of the layer of incompatible polymer is not necessarily from one to five times the thickness of the combination formed by the layer of the fluoropolymer and the adjacent layer of the polymer (A). The layer of incompatible polymer is then separated.<br>
It has also been found that it is possible to produce, using the tube blow extrusion process, a film comprising at least one layer of fluoropolymer containing fillers or at least one layer of polymer (A) and a layer of incompatible polymer. The layer of incompatible polymer is then separated.<br>
[Brief description of the invention]<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  process  for  manufacturing  a  film comprising at least one layer of a polymer chosen from thermoplastic fluoropolymers and polymers (A), in which blow extrusion process:  following are coextruded:<br>
	a) either at least one layer of a thermoplastic fluoropolymer and at least one<br>
layer of a polymer (A),<br>
b)	or at least one layer of a thermoplastic fluoropolymer containing fillers and optionally at least one other fluoropolymer layer,<br>
c)	or at least one layer of a polymer (A),<br>
the layers extruded in a), b) or c) adhering to one another,<br>
d)	a layer of another thermoplastic polymer (B) so that it forms a layer<br>
adjacent to the combination of the layers extruded in a), b) or c),<br>
e) optionally, another layer of (B) adjacent to the combination of the layers extruded in a), b) or c), on the opposite side from the layer extruded in d);<br>
*	the thermoplastic polymer (B) being incompatible with the fluoropolymer and the polymer (A) and possesses an extrudate strength sufficient to support the layers of fluoropolymer and/or of polymer (A);<br>
*	after the coextrudate has been cooled, at least the film comprising at least one layer of a polymer chosen from thermoplastic fluoropolymers and the polymers (A) is recovered by separation from the layer(s) of (B).<br>
[Detailed description of the invention]<br>
With regard to the fluoropolymer, this is understood to mean any polymer having in its chain at least one monomer chosen from compounds containing a vinyl group capable of opening in order to be polymerized and which contains, directly attached to this vinyl group, at least one fluorine atom, a fluoroalkyl group or a fluoroalkoxy group.<br>
By way of example of monomers, mention may be made of vinyl fluoride;<br>
vinylidene fluoride (VF2); trifluoroethylene (VF3); chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE); 1,2-<br>
difluoroethylene; tetrafluoroethylene (TFE); hexafluoropropylene (HFP); perfluoro(alkyl<br>
vinyl) ethers such as perfluoro(methyl vinyl) ether (PMVE), perfluoro(ethyl vinyl) ether<br>
(PEVE) and perfluoro(propyl vinyl) ether (PPVE); perfluoro(l,3-dioxole); perfluoro(2,2-<br>
dimethyl-l,3-dioxole) (PDD); the product of formula CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)OCF2CF2X in<br>
which X is S02F, C02H, CH20H, CH20CN or CH20P03H; the product of formula<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF2S02F; the product of formula F(CF2)nCH20CF=CF2 in which n equals<br>
1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; the product of formula R1CH20CF=CF2 in which Rl is hydrogen or F(CF2)z<br>
and	z	equals	1,	2,	3	or	4;	the	product<br>
of        formula        R30CF=CH2	in        which        R3	is        F(CF2)z-        and<br>
z is 1, 2, 3 or 4; perfluorobutylethylene (PFBE); 3,3,3-trifluoropropene and 2-trifluoro-methyl-3 ,3 ,3 -trifluoro-1-propene.<br>
The fluorogolymer may be a homopolymer or a copolymer; it may also comprise non-fluorinated monomers such as ethylene.<br>
Advantageously, the fluoropolymer is chosen from:<br>
vinylidene fluoride (VF2) homopolymers and copolymers preferably containing at least 50% by weight of VF2, the comonomer being chosen from chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP), trifluoroethylene (VF3) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE);<br>
trifluoroethylene (VF3) homopolymers and copolymers,<br>
copolymers, and especially terpolymers, combining the residues of the chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and/or ethylene units and possibly VF2 and/or VF3 units.<br>
Preferably, the fluoropolymer is a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) homopolymer. Advantageously, the PVDF has a viscosity ranging from 100 Pa.s to 2000 Pa.s, the viscosity being measured at 230°C, with a shear rate of 100 s-1 using a capillary rheometer. This is because such PVDFs are well suited to extrusion and to injection moulding. Preferably, the PVDF has a viscosity ranging from 300 Pa.s to 1200 Pa.s, the viscosity being measured at 230°C with a shear rate of 100 s-1 using a capillary rheometer.<br>
Thus, the PVDFs sold under the brand name KYNAR( 710 or 720 are perfectly suited for this formulation.<br>
With regard to the polymer (A), this has an affinity with the fluoropolymer for being possibly able to adhere to a layer of fluoropolymer. As examples of polymer (A), mention may be made of polyurethanes, polymers having blocks consisting of (meth)acrylate units, and acrylic polymers. For example (A) is an amorphous polymer.<br>
Advantageously (A) is an acrylic polymer. This polymer essentially consists of alkyl (meth)acrylate units and may also include acid, acid chloride, alcohol and anhydride functional groups. By way of example mention may be made of alkyl (meth)acrylate homopolymers. Alkyl (meth)acrylates are described in KIRK-OTHMER, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th edition in Vol. 1, pages 292-3 and in Vol. 16, pages 475-478. Mention may also be made of copolymers of at least two of these (meth)acrylates and copolymers of at least one (meth)acrylate with at least one monomer chosen from acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene and isoprene, provided that the proportion of (meth)acrylate is at least 50 mol%. Advantageously, (A) is PMMA. The MVI (melt volume index) of (A) may be between 2 and 15 cm3/10 min measured at 230°C under a load of 3.8 kg.<br>
It would not be outside the scope of the nvention if (A) were to be a blend of at least two acrylic polymers.<br>
With regard to the layer of polymer (A), this advantageously contains, in addition to (A), a fluoropolymer which may be the same as that of the layer of fluoropolymer, optionally an acrylic impact modifier and optionally fillers such as, for example, titanium oxide. The layer of polymer (A) may also contain additives such as antioxidants and UV stabilizers.<br>
The acrylic impact modifiers are, for example, random or block copolymers with at least one monomer chosen from styrene, butadiene, isoprene and at least one monomer chosen from acrylonitrile and alkyl (meth)acrylates. They may be of the core-shell<br>
type. These acrylic impact modifiers may also be present in (A) because they have been introduced during the polymerization of (A) or prepared simultaneously during the polymerization of (A). The core-shell copolymer is in the form of fine particles having an elastomer core and at least one thermoplastic shell, the particle size being generally less than 1 µm and advantageously between 800 and 500 nm. By way of example of the core, mention may be made of isoprene homopolymers or butadiene homopolymers, copolymers of isoprene with at most 30 mol% of a vinyl monomer and copolymers of butadiene with at most 30 mol% of a vinyl monomer. The vinyl monomer may be styrene, an alkylstyrene, acrylonitrile or an alkyl (meth)acrylate. Another core family consists of the homopolymers of an alkyl (meth)acrylate and the copolymers of an alkyl (meth)acrylate with at most 30 mol% of a vinyl monomer. The alkyl (meth)acrylate is advantageously butyl acrylate. The vinyl monomer may be styrene, an alkylstyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene or isoprene. The core may be completely or partly crosslinked. All that is required is to add at least difunctional monomers during the preparation of the core; these monomers may be chosen from poly(meth)acrylic esters of polyols, such as butylene di(meth)acrylate and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate. Other difunctional monomers are, for example, divinylbenzene, trivinylbenzene, vinyl acrylate and vinyl methacrylate. The core can also be crosslinked by introducing into it, by grafting or as a comonomer during the polymerization, unsaturated functional monomers such as anhydrides of unsaturated carboxylic acids, unsaturated carboxylic acids and unsaturated epoxides. Mention may be made, by way of example, of maleic anhydride, (meth)acrylic acid and glycidyl methacrylate. The shell(s) are styrene homopolymers, alkylstyrene homopolymers or methyl methacrylate homopolymers, or copolymers comprising at least 70 mol% of one of the above monomers and at least one comonomer chosen from the other above monomers, vinyl acetate and acrylonitrile. The shell may be functionalized by introducing into it, by grafting or as a comonomer during the polymerization, unsaturated functional monomers such as anhydrides of unsaturated carboxylic acids, unsaturated carboxylic acids and unsaturated epoxides. Mention may be made, for example, of maleic anhydride, (meth)acrylic acid and glycidyl methacrylate. By way of example, mention may be made of core-shell copolymers having a polystyrene shell and core-shell copolymers having a PMMA shell. There are also core-shell copolymers having two shells, one made of polystyrene and the other, on the outside, made of PMMA. Examples of core-shell copolymers and their method of preparation are described in the following patents: US 4,180,494, US 3,808,180, US 4,096,202, US 4,260,693, US 3,287,443, US 3,657,391, US 4,299,928 and US 3,985,704. Advantageously, the core represents, by weight, 70 to 90% of the core-shell assembly and the shell represents 30 to 10%. By way of<br>
example of a core-shell copolymer, mention may be made of that consisting (i) of 75 to 80 parts of a core comprising at least 93 mol% of butadiene, 5 mol% of styrene and 0.5 to 1 mol% of divinylbenzene and (ii) of 25 to 20 parts of two shells essentially of the same weight, the inner one made of polystyrene and the outer one made of PMMA.<br>
With regard to the advantageous forms of the layer of polymer (A), this layer comprises, by weight, the total being 100%:<br>
40 to 90% of polymer (A);<br>
0 to 35% of a fluoropolymer;<br>
the balance to 100% of an acrylic impact modifier.<br>
Preferably, the proportion of polymer (A) is between 40 and 55%. Preferably the proportion of fluoropolymer is between 20 and 30%).<br>
The thickness of the layer of polymer (A) may be between 3 and 60 (m. Advantageously, the thickness of the layer of polymer (A) is between 8 and 40 (m and preferably between 10 and 35µm          <br>
The compound constituting the layer of polymer (A) may be prepared using any device for mixing thermoplastic polymers and recovered in the form of granules which are then put into one of the extruders, which feeds the die of the blow extrusion system, or else prepared directly by mixing its constituents in this extruder.<br>
With regard to the layer of fluoropolymer, this advantageously contains, in addition to the fluoropolymer, a polymer (A) which may be the same as that of the layer of polymer (A) and optionally fillers such as, for example titanium oxide or other pigments. The layer of fluoropolymer may also contain additives such as antioxidants and UV stabilizers.<br>
According to another form of the invention (option b) in the brief description of the invention, in which one or more layers of fluoropolymer containing fillers and optionally at least one other layer of fluoropolymer are extruded, but in which a layer of polymer (A) is not extruded, the proportion of fillers may be up to 40% by weight for 60% by weight of fluoropolymer. Advantageously, this proportion is between 5 and 30%.<br>
With regard to the advantageous forms of the layer of fluoropolymer, this layer comprises, by weight, the total being 100%:<br>
50 to 100% of fluoropolymer;<br>
0 to 40% of a polymer (A);<br>
the balance to 100% of fillers. Preferably the proportion of fluoropolymer is between 50 and 85%. Preferably the proportion of polymer (A) is between 20 and 30%.<br>
The thickness of the fluoropolymer layer may be between 5 and 60, µm Advantageously, the thickness of the fluoropolymer layer is between 8 and 25µm and preferably between 10 and<br>
The compound constituting the layer of fluoropolymer may be prepared using any device for mixing thermoplastic polymers and recovered in the form of granules which are then put into one of the extruders, which feeds the die of the blow extrusion system, or else prepared directly by mixing its constituents in this extruder. It would not be outside the scope of the invention if the film were to comprise two or more layers of fluoropolymer and/or two or more layers of polymer (A). Preferably, the additional layers of fluoropolymer are placed on the same side as the existing layer of fluoropolymer and the additional layers of polymer (A) are placed on the same side as the existing layer of polymer (A).<br>
The process of the invention consists, using the blow coextrusion process, in coextruding the fluoropolymer and/or the polymer (A) with a thermoplastic polymer (B) which is incompatible, in such a way that, after the bubble has been cooled and laid flat, the film comprising the layer of fluoropolymer and/or the layer of polymer (A) and the film(s) of polymer (B) are recovered separately, such as by separate winding of the separated films. The incompatible thermoplastic polymer (B) must have no affinity, and in particular no adhesion affinity, with the fluoropolymer and with the polymer (A).<br>
This polymer (B) must be such that, once it has been coextruded with the fluoropolymer and/or the polymer (A), its film can be separated without any effort from the fluoropolymer and/or from the polymer (A). This polymer (B), serving as support during the extrusion and blowing, must of course have an extrude strength, that is to say a hot melt strength, sufficient to withstand the extrusion and blowing stresses and to support the fluoropolymer and/or the polymer (A). To do this, it is recommended that this polymer possess a relatively high melt viscosity, of the order of 103 to 104 Pa.s at a shear rate of 100 s-1, together with good shear strength and good tensile strength. Among polymers that can be used, mention may be made by way of examples of polyethylenes, impact polystyrene and plasticized polyvinyl chloride. Among polyethylenes, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is preferred.<br>
The relative thicknesses of the extruded materials in the extrudate are adjusted, on the one hand, according to the desired final thickness in the case of the fluoropolymer and/or the polymer (A) and, on the other hand, according to the strength of the bubble in the case of (B). In general, the thickness of the layer (or the sum of the thicknesses of the two layers) of the film of incompatible polymer (B) is from 0.3 to 2 times, and better still from 0.5 to 1 times, the sum of the thicknesses of the possible layer(s) of fluoropolymer<br>
and of the possible layer(s) of polymer (A). Furthermore, if it is wished not to retain the support film of thermoplastic polymer (B), it is possible to recycle it in the system in order to form a new support film. Statement of Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for manufacturing a film comprising one layer of a polymer chosen from thermoplastic fluoropolymers having in its chain one monomer chosen from compounds containing a vinyl group capable of opening in order to be polymerized and which contains, directly attached to this vinyl group , one flourine atom, a fluoroalkyl group or a fluoroalkoxy group and from polymers (A) being chosen from polyurethane, polymers having blocks consisting of (meth) acrylate units and acrylic polymers and having an affinity with the fluoropolymer for being possibly able to adhere to a layer of fluoropolymer, in which blown extrusion process comprises the following steps:<br>
(i)        Coextruding the following :<br>
a)	either at least one layer of thermoplastic fluoropolymer and at least one layer of<br>
a polymer (A)<br>
b)	or at least one layer of thermoplastic fluoropolymer containing fillers and optionally one other fluoropolymer layer,<br>
c)	or at least one layer of a polymer (A), such that when there are at least two layers in a), b) or c) then at least two layers adhere to one another,<br>
d)	a layer of another thermoplastic polymer (a) adjacent to the layer(s) a), b) or c) of the thermoplastic polymer (B) being incompatible with fluoropolymer or with the polymer (A) and possesing an extrude strength sufficient to withstand the extrusion and blowing stresses and to support the layer(s) a) or b) or c) such that when there are at least two layers in a), b) or c), the at least two layers adhere to one another.<br>
(ii) recovering the film by separation of the layer of the thermoplastic polymer (B).<br>
[Examples]<br>
We produced the films described in Table 1 according to the invention on a Kiefel machine equipped with 3 extruders, the characteristics of which are given in Table 2. These films were extruded through an annular die of spiral mandrel technology. Pressurised air was blown into the system so as to form a tube of variable diameter. The pressure of this air is characterised by the blow-up ratio, this being defined as the diameter of the tube divided by the diameter of the die. Table 1 specifies the value of this ratio for each example.
