Description<br>
TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING CONTROL INFORMATION FOR MULTIMEDIA BROADCAST/MULTICAST<br>
SERVICE IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS)<br>
and, more particularly, to transmitting and receiving control information for an MBMS.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third-generation<br>
mobile communications system evolving from the global system for mobile communications system (GSM), which is the European standard. The UMTS is aimed at providing enhanced mobile communications services based on the GSM core network and wideband code-division multiple-access technologies.<br>
[3]	A related art UMTS network structure 1 is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown, a<br>
mobile terminal, or user equipment (UE) 2 is connected to a core network (CN) 4 through a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) 6. The UTRAN 6 configures, maintains and manages a radio access bearer for communications between the UE 2 and the core network 4 to meet end-to-end quality of service requirements.<br>
[4]	The UTRAN 6 includes a plurality of radio network subsystems (RNS) 8, each of<br>
which comprises one radio network controller (RNC) 10 for a plurality base stations, or Node Bs 12. The RNC 10 connected to a given base station 12 is the controlling RNC for allocating and managing the common resources provided for any number of UEs 2 operating in one cell. One or more cells exist in one Node B. The controlling RNC 10 controls traffic load, cell congestion, and the acceptance of new radio links. Each Node B 12 may receive an uplink signal from a UE 2 and may transmit a downlink signals to the UE 2. Each Node B 12 serves as an access point enabling a UE 2 to connect to the UTRAN 6, while an RNC 10 serves as an access point for connecting the corresponding Node Bs to the core network 4.<br>
[5]	Among the radio network subsystems 8 of the UTRAN 6, the serving RNC 10 is the<br>
RNC managing dedicated radio resources for the provision of services to a specific UE 2 and is the access point to the core network 4 for data transfer to the specific UE. All other RNCs 10 connected to the UE 2 are drift RNCs, such that there is only one serving RNC connecting the UE to the core network 4 via the UTRAN 6. The drift RNCs 10 facilitate the routing of user data and allocate codes as common resources.<br>
[6]	The interface between the UE 2 and the UTRAN 6 is realized through a radio<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
interface protocol established in accordance with radio access network specifications describing a physical layer (LI), a data link layer (L2) and a network layer (L3) described in, for example 3GPP specifications. These layers are based on the lower three layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) model that is a well-known in communications systems.<br>
[7]	A related art architecture of the radio interface protocol is illustrated in Figure 2. As<br>
shown, the radio interface protocol is divided horizontally into the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer, and is divided vertically into a user plane for carrying data traffic such as voice signals and Internet protocol packet transmissions and a control plane for carrying control information for the maintenance and management of the interface.<br>
[8]	The physical layer (PHY) provides information transfer service to a higher layer<br>
and is linked via transport channels to a medium access control (MAC) layer. Data travels between the MAC layer and the physical layer via a transport channel. Also, data transmission is performed through a physical channel between different physical layers, namely, between physical layers of a sending side (transmitter) and a receiving side (transmitter).<br>
[9]	The MAC layer of the second layer (L2) provides information transfer service to a<br>
higher layer and is linked via a logical channel to a radio link control (RLC) layer. The RLC layer of the second layer (L2) supports the transmission of reliable data and can perform segmentation and concatenation functions for RLC service data units (SDU) received from an upper layer.<br>
[10]	The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane and controls transport channels and physical channels with respect to the establishment, re-establishment, and release of radio bearers. A radio bearer (RB) is a service provided by a lower layer, such as the RLC layer or the MAC layer, for transferring data between the UE 2 and the UTRAN 6.<br>
[11]	The establishment of an RB determines regulating characteristics of the protocol<br>
layer and channel needed to provide a specific service, thereby establishing the parameters and operational methods of the service. When a connection is established to allow transmission between an RRC layer of a specific UE 2 and an RRC layer of the UTRAN 6, the UE 2 is said to be in the RRC-connected state. Without such connection, the UE 2 is in an idle state.<br>
[12]	Hereafter, a Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS or "MBMS service")<br>
will be described. MBMS refers to a method of providing streaming or background services to a plurality of UEs 2 using a downlink-dedicated MBMS radio bearer that utilizes at least one of point-to-multipoint and point-to-point radio bearer. One MBMS<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
service includes one or more sessions and MBMS data is transmitted to the plurality of terminals through the MBMS radio bearer only while the session is ongoing.<br>
[13]	As the name implies, an MBMS may be carried out in a broadcast mode or a<br>
multicast mode. The broadcast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to all UEs 2 within a broadcast area, for example the domain where the broadcast is available. The multicast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to a specific UE 2 group within a multicast area, for example the domain where the multicast service is available.<br>
[14]	The UTRAN 6 provides the MBMS service to the UEs 2 using the RB. RBs used by<br>
the UTRAN 6 can be classified as a point-to-point RB or a point-to-multipoint RB. The point-to-point RB is a bi-directional RB, including a logical channel DTCH (Dedicated Traffic Channel), a transport channel DCH (Dedicated Channel) and a physical channel DPCH (Dedicated Physical Channel) or SCCPCH (Secondary Common Control Physical Channel).<br>
[15]	The point-to-multipoint RB is a uni-directional downlink RB, including a logical<br>
channel MTCH (MBMS Traffic Channel), a transport channel FACH (Forward Access Channel), and the physical channel SCCPCH, as shown in Figure 3. The logical channel MTCH is configured for each MBMS service provided to one cell and used to transmit user plane data of a specific MBMS service to the UEs 2.<br>
[16]	The UTRAN 6 providing the MBMS service transmits MBMS-related control in-<br>
formation to the plurality of terminals (UEs 2) through an MCCH (MBMS Control Channel). Herein, the logical channel MCCH is the point-to-multipoint downlink channel and is mapped to the FACH, which is mapped to the SCCPCH. The MBMS-related control information includes a session start for indicating the start of an MBMS service, a session stop for indicating the end of the MBMS service, an RB type indicator for indicating whether the MBMS service is provided via a point-to-point RB or a point-to-multipoint RB, RB information for providing point-to-multipoint RB information such as the MTCH if the RB is a point-to-multipoint RB, counting information for measuring the number of terminals desiring to receive the MBMS service, and re-counting information for re-counting the number of terminals desiring the MBMS service while the MBMS service is being provided.<br>
[17]	The MBMS-related control information may be included in an independent<br>
message and transmitted, or can be entirely included in one MBMS control message. To transmit various control information related to the MBMS service, the logical channel MCCH is used. Channel mapping of the MCCH is similar to that of the MTCH. Namely, the MCCH is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel and is mapped to the transport channel FACH, which is mapped to the physical channel SCCPCH. For reference, only one MTCH is provided for one service, while only one MCCH is provided for one cell.<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
[18]	The terminal (UE) 2 wishing to receive an MBMS service, must first receive<br>
MBMS control information through the MCCH. However, because the terminal 2 can receive only one SCCPCH for the MBMS, and the MCCH is transmitted through a different SCCPCH irrelative to the MTCH, the terminal cannot receive the MCCH if the terminal has already received one or more MBMS services.<br>
[19]	An MBMS control information reception indication message (MCCH Indication<br>
Message) is used to indicate information to terminals receiving one or more MBMS services, i.e., receiving the MTCH. The MCCH indication message is transmitted through the SCCPCH. The MTCH is also transmitted through the SCCPCH. In order to receive the MBMS data, the mobile terminal 2 receives one SCCPCH. The UTRAN 6 transmits the MCCH indication message through the SCCPCH so that the mobile terminal 2 can receive the control information transmitted through the MCCH. In this case, the MCCH indication message can be transmitted through the MTCH the mobile terminal 2 is receiving, or through an auxiliary channel, such as a Secondary MCCH (S-MCCH), wherein the S-MCCH is mapped to the same SCCPCH as the MTCH. The S-MCCH is an arbitrary channel, which can be a dedicated channel such as a DCCH (Dedicated Control Channel), a common channel such as a CCCH (Common Control Channel), or a new dedicated or common channel. No matter which channel is used, the MCCH indication information is transmitted through the same SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped.<br>
[20]	The MCCH indication message is a 1-bit indication message. When certain control<br>
information is transmitted through the MCCH, the MCCH indication message is used to indicate that the mobile terminal 2 should receive the control information. Namely, when the mobile terminal 2 receives the MCCH indication message in the course of receiving the MTCH, the mobile terminal 2 switches the channel from the SCCPCH through which the MTCH is transmitted to the SCCPCH through which the MCCH is transmitted, and receives the MBMS control information transmitted through the MCCH. After the mobile terminal 2 receives the desired MBMS control information through the MCCH, the mobile terminal 2 then switches (he SCCPCH to which the MTCH is mapped and receives the MTCH.<br>
[21]	In the related art MCCH indication message, the 1-bit indication message only<br>
indicates to the mobile terminal 2 to receive the MCCH. This method is advantageous in that the transmission amount of the indication message can be maximized. However, the related art MCCH indication message also has the following problems. First, the mobile terminal 2 does not know which service the MCCH indication message indicates to receive. Thus, the mobile terminal 2 may receive an MCCH indication message unnecessarily even when control information for a service the mobile terminal 2 does not want to receive is transmitted.<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
[22]	Additionally, the mobile terminal 2 does not know which control information the<br>
MCCH indication message indicates to receive. Thus, when various types of control information are continuously transmitted, the mobile terminal 2 does not know which control information to receive, and further does not know at which time the MTCH should be received again. Moreover, if the same control information is transmitted repeatedly several times, the mobile terminal 2 will unnecessarily receive the already-received control message again.<br>
[23]	Therefore, in the related art, the mobile terminal 2 frequently receives the MCCH<br>
unnecessarily. This is problematic because while the mobile terminal 2 receives the MCCH, it cannot receive the MTCH. Hence, MBMS data is lost. Accordingly, as the mobile terminal 2 reads more MCCHs, the loss of MBMS data increases. A method for minimizing the number of times the MCCH is read by the mobile terminal 2 is therefore required.

Mode for Invention<br>
[54]	The present invention relates to a method for minimizing data loss as a mobile<br>
terminal unnecessarily reads an MCCH for receiving MBMS control information in the course of receiving MBMS data. For this purpose, the present invention provides a method for constructing an MBMS control information reception indication message (MCCH indication message) and a method for receiving the MBMS control in-formation using the same,<br>
[55]	Although the present invention is implemented in a mobile communication system,<br>
such as a UMTS developed under 3GPP specifications, the present invention can also be applied to a communication system operating in conformity with a different spec-ification.<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
[56]	In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an MCCH<br>
indication message comprises a service ID for identifying which service the control in-formation is transmitted for and an RRC message ID for indicating what kind of control information is transmitted. The MCCH indication message further comprises update information for indicating whether a currently transmitted MCCH indication message or currently transmitted control information (RRC message) transmitted through the MCCH is new or updated information or previously transmitted in-formation. The MCCH indication message also includes timing information for indicating a time interval for receiving the MCCH.<br>
[57]	The MCCH indication message is preferably transmitted through the MTCH which<br>
is being received by the mobile terminal or through the S-MCCH mapped to the SCCPCH that transmits the MTCH. The MCCH indication message may include at least one of the service ID, the RRC message ID, the update information and the timing information.<br>
[58]	The RRC message ID includes a session start information for indicating the start of<br>
an MBMS service, a session stop information for indicating the end of the MBMS service, an RB type indicator for indicating what type of RB the MBMS services is p rovided by, RB information for providing point-to-multipoint RB information such as the MTCH if the RB type is a point-to-multipoint RB, counting information for measuring the number of terminals desiring to receive the MBMS service, and re-counting information for re-counting the number of terminals desiring the MBMS service while the MBMS service is being provided.<br>
[59]	The update information is a type of value tag for informing the mobile terminal<br>
(UE) of the newness of a transmitted MCCH indication message or RRC message. The update information may be divided into two types. One type is update information related to an MCCH indication message. The other type is update information related to an RRC message. Notably, the mobile terminal operates differently depending on the type of the update information.<br>
[60]	If the update information is update information related to the MCCH indication<br>
message, the mobile terminal stores the update information of an MCCH indication message whenever the corresponding MCCH indication message is received. Furthermore, when an MCCH indication message is received, the mobile terminal compares the received update information included in the MCCH indication message with the previously stored update information. If no update information has been previously stored or if the two update information are different, the mobile terminal determines that the currently received update information is new information. If, however, the two update information are the same, the mobile terminal determines that the currently received update information is the same as the previously stored update<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
information.<br>
[61]	If the update information is update information related to the RRC message, the<br>
MCCH indication message comprises the RRC message ID and the update in-formation. When the terminal receives the MCCH indication message, it stores cor-responding update information for each RRC message. Moreover, if a new MCCH indication message is received, the terminal compares the update information received with respect to the RRC message ID and previously stored update information. If no update information has been stored or if the two update information are different, the mobile terminal determines that the currently received update information is new in-formation. If, however, the two update information are the same, the mobile terminal determines that the currently received update information is the same as the previously stored update information.<br>
[62]	The timing information indicates information related to a time interval for the<br>
mobile terminal to receive the MCCH. The time interval information may include at least one of an MCCH reception start time, reception end time and reception interval time. The time interval information may be general timing information, frame in-formation or slot information.<br>
[63]	If a service ID is included in the MCCH indication message, the mobile terminal<br>
checks the service ID. If the service ID is not related to the mobile terminal or to a service the mobile terminal is currently receiving or desires to receive, the mobile terminal disregards the received MCCH indication message and continues to receive the MTCH. If, however, the service ID corresponds to an MBMS service being received or desired to be received, the mobile terminal receives the control information transmitted through the MCCH by switching the reception channel from the MTCH to the MCCH.<br>
[64]	If the RRC message ID is included in the MCCH indication message, the mobile<br>
terminal checks the RRC message ID. The mobile terminal then switches the reception channel from the MTCH to the MCCH to specifically receive the control information indicated by the RRC message ID among all control information transmitted through the MCCH.<br>
[65]	If the update information is included in the MCCH indication message, the mobile<br>
terminal checks whether the received indication message is a new message by comparing the received update information with previously stored update information. If the received update information is the same as the previously stored update in-formation, the mobile terminal determines that the received MCCH indication message is the same as a previously received MCCH indication message. Accordingly, the mobile terminal disregards the received MCCH indication message and continues to receive the MTCH. If, however, no update information has been previously stored or if<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
the received update information is different from the previously stored update in-formation, the mobile terminal stores the received update information and receives the control, information transmitted through the MCCH by switching, from the MTCH to the MCCH.<br>
[66]	Also, if the timing information is included in the MCCH indication message, the<br>
mobile terminal receives the MCCH by switching the reception channel from the MTCH to the MCCH during a time interval indicated by the received timing in-formation. If the timing information includes a reception start time, the mobile terminal begins receiving the MCCH from the start time indicated. If the timing information includes a reception end time, the mobile terminal terminates reception of the MCCH at the end time indicated. If the timing information includes a reception interval time, the mobile terminal receives the MCCH during the time interval indicated.<br>
[67]	Preferably, the MCCH indication message includes at least one of the service ID,<br>
the RRC message ID, the update information and the timing information. If at least one of these pieces of information are included in the MCCH indication message, the mobile terminal receives control information by performing a separate operation for each piece of information as described above.<br>
[68]	For example, if the MCCH indication message includes the service ID and the RRC<br>
message ID, the mobile terminal checks the service ID. If the received service ID is not related to the mobile terminal, the terminal disregards the received MCCH indication message and continues receiving the MTCH. If, however, the received service ID is a service ID of an MBMS being received or desired to be received by the mobile terminal, the terminal switches from the MTCH to the MCCH to receive control in-formation transmitted through the MCCH. When the terminal receives the control in-formation indicated by the RRC message ID among all control information transmitted through the MCCH, the mobile terminal operates according to the corresponding control information.<br>
[69]	If the service ID and the update information are included in the MCCH indication<br>
message, the terminal checks the service ID. If the received service ID is not related to the mobile terminal, the terminal disregards the received MCCH indication message and continues receiving the MTCH. If, however, the received service ID is a service ID of an MBMS being received or desired to be received by the mobile terminal, the terminal additionally checks the update information. If the received update information is the same as previously stored update information, the terminal disregards the received MCCH indication message and continues receiving the MTCH. If, however, there is no stored update information or if the previously stored update information is different from the currently received update information, the terminal stores the received update information. The mobile terminal then receives control information<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR200S/000390<br>
transmitted through the MCCH by switching from MTCH to the MCCH.<br>
[70]	If (he MCCH indication message includes the RRC message ID and the update in-<br>
formation, the terminal checks whether the received MCCH indication message or the RRC message to be transmitted through the MCCH is a new message by comparing the received update information with previously stored update information. If the received update information is the same as the previously stored update information, the mobile terminal disregards the received MCCH indication message and continues receiving the MTCH. If, however, there is no stored update information or if the previously stored update information is different from the currently received update in-formation, the mobile terminal stores the received update information related to the MCCH indication message or the RRC message. The mobile terminal then switches from the MTCH to the MCCH to receive control information transmitted through the MCCH. When the mobile terminal receives the control information indicated by the RRC message ID among all the control information transmitted through the MCCH, the terminal performs a follow-up operation according to the corresponding control in-formation.<br>
[71]	As described above, the present invention presents the case where the MCCH<br>
indication message includes two among the service ID, the RRC message ID and the update information. However, the present invention can readily be applied to the case where the MCCH indication message includes two or three among the service ID, the RRC message, the update information and the timing information, wherein the mobile terminal separately processes a corresponding operation with respect to each piece of information and receives control information accordingly.<br>
[72]	In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a method for selective<br>
ly transmitting and receiving control information for an MB MS service is illustrated in Figure 4. As shown, while a mobile terminal (UE) 50 is provided with a first MB MS service (MBMS1), a second MBMS service (MBMS2) begins. Accordingly, a UTRAN 100 informs the mobile terminal 50 about a session start of the second MBMS service. Here, an MCCH indication message includes a service ID, an RRC message ID, update information and timing information.<br>
[73]	The terminal 50 receives MBMS 1 data at an L1/L2 layer through an MTCH1 (step<br>
S10). An RRC of the terminal 50 receives the MCCH indication message through the MTCH1 or the S-MCCH in the course of receiving the MBMS 1 data (step SI 1). Here, the MCCH indication message is a control information reception indication message for the MBMS2. At this time, it is assumed that the service ID has a value of 2 and the RRC message ID indicates a session start. Both the service ID and the RRC message ID are transmitted through the MCCH indication message.<br>
[74]	The mobile terminal 50 checks the service ID and determines whether the MBMS2<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
service is a service the mobile terminal 50 desires to receive. If the MBMS2 is a service the mobile terminal 50 desires to receive, the terminal checks the update in-formation to determine whether control information to be transmitted is new and whether the MCCH is to be received (step S12). If the MCCH is determined to be received, the RRC of the terminal 50 instructs lower layers, such as the PHY/ MAC/RLC (L1/L2 layers), to switch the reception channel from the MTCH1 to the MCCH at a time indicated by the timing information (step SI3). According to the in-struction of the RRC of the terminal, the lower layers switch the reception channel from the MTCH1 to the MCCH (step S14). Consequently, because the MTCH1 and the MCCH are mapped to a different SCCPCH, the physical channel is also switched.<br>
[75]	Thereafter, the terminal RRC continuously receives an RRC message indicated by<br>
the RRC message ID through the MCCH (step S15). Preferably, the terminal RRC receives a session start message of the MBMS2.<br>
[76]	Upon receiving the session start information of the MBMS2, the terminal RRC<br>
determines whether to continuously receive the MBMS1 or the new MBMS2. In this case, a user is informed about the session start of the MBMS2 and a follow-up operation is determined according to the user's decision (step SI6). In this embodiment, it is assumed that the user desires to receive the MBMS2.<br>
[77]	As the user determines to receive the new MBMS2, the terminal RRC instructs the<br>
lower layers such as the PHY/MAC/RLC to switch the reception channel from the MCCH to the MTCH2 (step S17). Accordingly, the lower layers switch the reception channel from the MCCH to the MTCH2 so that the mobile terminal 50 (UE L1/L2) can receive MBMS2 data at the L1/L2 layer through the MTCH2.<br>
[78]	As so far described, the method for transmitting and receiving control information<br>
for an MBMS service in accordance with the present invention has many advantages. For example, if the terminal receives the MBMS control information reception indication message (MCCH indication message) in the course of receiving one or more MBMS services, the service ID, the RRC message ID and the update information included in the MBMS control information reception indication message are checked to determine whether to receive the MCCH. The mobile terminal is thus prevented from unnecessarily receiving the MCCH when control information to be received through the MCCH has already been received by the mobile terminal or when control information to be received corresponds to a service unrelated to the mobile terminal. Thus, a loss of MBMS data due to the unnecessary reception of the MCCH can be reduced.<br>
[79]	In addition, the timing information is included and transmitted in the MBMS<br>
control information reception indication message. This prevents the mobile terminal from receiving the MCCH for an unnecessarily long time. Therefore, the loss of<br><br>
WO 2005/078963	PCT/KR2005/000390<br>
MBMS data is further reduced.<br>
