FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to certain heteroaromatic N-substituted glycine derivatives that are inhibitors of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, and thus have use in treating diseases benefiting from the inhibition of this enzyme, anemia being one example<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Anemia occurs when there is a decrease or abnormality in red blood cells, which leads to reduced oxygen levels in the blood  Anemia occurs often in cancer patients, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. Anemia is often seen in the elderly population, patients with renal disease, and m a wide variety of conditions associated with chronic disease.<br>
Frequently, the cause of anemia is reduced erythropoietin (Epo) production resulting in prevention of erythropoiesis (maturation of red blood cells)   Epo production can be increased by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases that regulate hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)<br>
One strategy to increase erythropoietin (Epo) production is to stabilize and thus increase the transcriptional activity of the HIF   HIF-alpha subunits (HIF -1 alpha, HIF-2alpha, and HIF -3alpha) are rapidly degraded by proteosome under normoxic conditions upon hydroxylation of proline residues by prolyl hydroxylases (EGLN1, 2, 3)   Proline hydroxylation allows interaction with the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, a component of an E3 ubiquitm ligase   This leads to ubiquitination of HIF-alpha and subsequent degradation   Under hypoxic conditions, the inhibitory activity of the prolyl hydroxylases is suppressed, HIF-alpha subunits are therefore stabilized, and HIF-responsive genes, including Epo, are transcribed. Thus, inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases results m increased levels of HIF-alpha and thus increased Epo production<br>
The compounds of this invention provide a means for inhibiting these hydrolases, increasing Epo production, and thereby treating anemia   Ischemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cytoprotection may also benefit by administering these compounds<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In the first instance, this invention relates to a compound of formula (I)<br>

A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the age and weight of the intended recipient, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant prescribing the<br>
medication  However, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of anemia will generally be in the range of 0 001 to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient per day, suitably m the range of 01 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day    For a 70kg adult mammal, the actual amount per day would suitably be from 7 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose per day or in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or sohate, etc   may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound of formula (I) per se   It is envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to above<br>

Cy5-labelled HIF2a CODD, and a biotm-labeled VBC complex were used to determine EGLN3 inhibition EGLN3 hydroxylation of the Cy5CODD substrate results m its recognition by the biotm-VBC. Addition of a Europium/streptavidm (Eu/SA) chelate results in proximity of Eu to Cy5 in the product, allowing for detection by energy transfer A ratio of Cy5 to Eu emission (LANCE Ratio) is the ultimate readout, as this normalized parameter has significantly less vanance than the Cy5 emission alone<br>
