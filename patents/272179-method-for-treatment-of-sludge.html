				<td>Description:<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for treatment of sludge, and more particularly to a method for treatment of sludge with a facultative membrane bioreactor.<br>
[0002] Currently, more than 50% of sewage treatment plants adopt aerobic activated sludge process to treat sewage. However, the process produces a large amount of excess sludge that has complicated components and does great harm to environment. Conventional methods for treating excess sludge mainly lie in that excess sludge is firstly dehydrated in a sewage plant and then packaged and transported for landfill, incineration, or composting and so on.<br>
[0003] However, these conventional methods have disadvantages as below: (1) in order to make excess sludge dehydrated and transport the dehydrated excess sludge, the overall investment of sludge treatment system is large; (2) the relevant technology and equipment required for an incineration method are complicated, high energy consuming and high cost, and causes atmospheric pollution; (3) a sludge landfill method requires a high soil mechanics properties of sludge, a large area of space and high transportation cost, additionally, the method easily cause groundwater pollution and atmospheric pollution due to landfill smell; and (4) a composting method easily causes heavy metal pollution.<br>
[0004] In view of the above-described problems, it is one objective of the invention to provide a method for treatment of sludge with a facultative membrane bioreactor that greatly reduces the yield of excess sludge.<br>
[0005] To achieve the above objectives, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method for treatment of sludge with a facultative membrane bioreactor that greatly reduces the yield of excess sludge, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
[0006] a) providing a sludge treatment system comprising a facultative digestion tank, a membrane module, an aeration system, a sludge pump, and a drainage pump; <br>
[0007] b) pumping sludge into the facultative digestion tank via the sludge pump and allowing for digestion; <br>
[0008] c) synchronously aerating and scouring the membrane module by the aeration system;<br>
[0009] d) pumping the sludge by the drainage pump and filtrating by the membrane module so that sludge and water are separated; and <br>
[0010] e) draining the water via the drainage pump.<br>
[0011] In a class of this embodiment, the facultative digestion tank provides reaction conditions for facultative or anaerobic digestion of sludge, and most area of the facultative digestion tank is maintained in a facultative or anaerobic state, the average concentration of dissolved oxygen being 
[0012] The above-mentioned sludge digestion refers to the disintegration of excess sludge due to the endogenous respiration of microbe. The resultant organic compounds are completely decomposed into water, carbon dioxide, and inorganic salts in the presence of facultative or anaerobic microbe in the facultative digestion tank. The water and inorganic salts are drained out and the carbon dioxide becomes a part of the atmosphere.<br>
[0013] In a class of this embodiment, the facultative digestion tank is made of reinforced concrete or steel.<br>
[0014] In a class of this embodiment, the sludge is pumped by the sludge pump from a secondary sedimentation tank into the facultative digestion tank. An opening and closure of the sludge pump is controlled by a ball-float level indicator in the facultative digestion tank.<br>
[0015] In a class of this embodiment, the membrane module is micro-filtration membrane module, the amount thereof is based on the amount of daily treated sludge, and the water yield thereof is equivalent to the amount of daily treated organic excess sludge.<br>
[0016] In a class of this embodiment, the aeration system mainly provides air-water scouring against the membrane module so as to prevent sludge from depositing and polluting the membrane.<br>
[0017] In a class of this embodiment, the aeration system is a blower aeration system.<br>
[0018] In a class of this embodiment, the aeration system is a jet aeration system.<br>
[0019] In a class of this embodiment, the blower aeration system comprises a blower, an air duct, an aeration pipe, an aeration branch pipe, and a perforated aeration tube. The perforated aeration tube is disposed below the membrane module. The blower is disposed out of the facultative digestion tank and connected to the perforated aeration tube via the air duct, the aeration pipe, and the aeration branch pipe, and provides air-water scouring against the membrane module, and an air-water ratio being 10-30: 1.<br>
[0020] In a class of this embodiment, the jet aeration system comprises a jet aerator, an air inlet, a water inlet, an outlet, an aeration pipe, an aeration branch pipe, and a perforated aeration tube. The jet aerator is disposed between the membrane modules or at the side of the membrane module. The air inlet is disposed above the liquid surface of the facultative digestion tank. The water inlet is disposed below the liquid surface of the facultative digestion tank. The outlet is connected to the perforated aeration tube via the aeration pipe and the aeration branch pipe.<br>
[0021] When the jet aeration system works, a negative pressure is formed due to high speed of fluid flow in the jet aerator, and air is absorbed by the air inlet and forms a mixture having microbe with liquid and solid in the aeration pipe. The mixture is transported by the perforated aeration tube and scours against the membrane modules, and thereby a pollution of the membrane module is avoided.<br>
[0022] In a class of this embodiment, the perforated aeration tube is disposed equidistantly below the membrane module, and connected to the blower or jet aerator via the aeration pipe, the aeration branch pipe and/or the air duct.<br>
[0023] In a class of this embodiment, both ends of the aeration branch pipe are closed, and both sides are connected to the perforated aeration tube. A plurality of aeration holes is disposed on the perforated aeration tube. An angle between the aeration hole and vertical line is ±44°- 46°; a diameter of the aeration hole is 4-10 mm; and a distance between two aeration holes is 100-300 mm.<br>
[0024] In a class of this embodiment, the perforated aeration tube is disposed 100-500 mm below the bottom of the membrane module, and is composed of corrosion-resistant tubes.<br>
[0025] Advantages of the invention are summarized below: the method can digest sludge completely in the digestion tank, and solves problems existing in conventional sludge treatment methods such as large investment and high transportation cost, even achieves a subject of zero discharge of sludge.<br>
