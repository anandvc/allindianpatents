				<td>Device with a lock cylinder and a switching unit for various electrical functions, particularly ignition starting switches for motor vehicles.<br>
with a key-activatable lock cylinder and<br>
The invention pertains to the device of the type described in the introductory part of claim 1 a  switching  unit.<br>
The lock cylinder consists of a fixed cylinder housing and a pivoted cylinder core in it. Only in a certain starting rotation position of cylinder core, it is possible to insert and withdraw the key in its key channel. By turning the key, the cylinder core can be brought into certain defined rotation positions, which are designated below briefly as "working positions". In these working positions certain electrical functions in the motor vehicle or in any other utility object can be rendered effective or ineffective by means of the switching unit.<br>
In the application in motor vehicles such a device serves as socalled "ignition starting switch". In the known device, the switching unit is positioned on the inner end of the lock cylinder, which - apart from a contact member which moves along on turning the key - also has fixed contacts, which are connected to the given dashboard electric panel   The movable switching member is coupled to the cylinder core in a fixed manner. In the working positions the mobile contact members comes in electrical contact with such a fixed contact to which the unit in the vehicle responsible for this function is connected. In the case of an ignition starting switch, apart from the starting rotation position, there are generally three more working positions. This includes, to start with, a first working position for switching on the vehicle electric panel, a second working position for the combustion engine provided for the vehicle for ignition release and a third working position for starting the engine.<br>
In the known device, the switching unit requires a lot of space and is placed in a position which is inconvenient. In the known ignition starting switch, the switching unit is positioned at the inner end of the lock cylinder, which is then no longer available for other important components in the vehicle. Thus the ignition starting switch is regularly arranged in the region of the steering column of a vehicle where it has to fulfil other tasks. This also includes the blockade of the steering column when the key is taken out. In case of mechanical contacting of the members in the switching unit there would be problems. The angular distances between the working positions of the cylinder core generating the various functions could be very small, which is why the contact distances in the switching unit can be distinguished reliably only if a sufficiently large radial space for the angular displacement of the mobile switching member is<br><br>
2<br>
available. Besides, even due to safety reasons, minimum space requirement has to be provided for the*switching unit. All this increases the overall requirement of space.<br>
There are keys (US 5 186 031 A) in which a permanent magnet is attached on the circumference of the cylinder core. When the cylinder is rotated by the key, then there is an electronic query by a sensor integrated in the cylinder housing, which then addresses the magnetic field of the moved cylinder core. This is supposed to activate the electric panel in the vehicle, through which the above described switching unit can be rendered effective. If one wrenches off the lock cylinder with force, then electrical manipulations on the contacts will be without success. Without activating of the switching unit by the moved permanent magnet, the switching unit remains ineffective. A saving in space in the construction of known device therefore seem not possible.<br>
In another device(US 5 455 571 A), one has tried to make unauthorised reading of the activation signal by unauthorised persons difficult by providing yet another second sensor which acts on the signal output of the addressed first sensor. In this way, determination of the signal value was supposed to be prevented for outsiders.<br>
with a key activatable lock cylinde<br>
It is the task of this invention to develop a reliable device as described in the introductory part<br>
and a switching unit.<br>
of claim 1, which is simple and space-saving. This task is fulfilled as per the invention by<br>
described below. means .of the measures tisted in the features of tho claim 1, which gain the following special<br>
The permanent magnet in the cylinder core on the one hand, and the sensors in the cylinder housing, on the other hand, are used to code all defined working positions of the cylinder core. Therefore, with the help of the sensors, the respective working position of the cylinder core can be singularly identified and reported to an evaluator, which functions at the same time as an electronic switching unit and releases the individual electrical functions in the vehicle or in any other utility object. Whereas, in the state-of-art technology, determination of the rotation position took place by means of a mobile member of the switching unit which moves along with the cylinder core, in the case of this invention the identification of the rotation positions have been left to the fixed sensors in the cylinder housing. The evaluator controlled by the code for the code-specific electrical functions is connected to the reading station in the cylinder housing only through signal lines of low diameter, and can be arranged at any distant location.<br><br>
3<br>
Because, now it is no longer a question of only mechanical but also electronic components, which effect the desired electrical functions, it is possible to manufacture the switching unit with the device as per the invention in an extraordinarily space-saving and cost-effective manner. The device as per the invention only requires holes in the cylinder housing to accommodate the sensors determining the coding, as well as the permanent magnet in the cylinder core, on which the circumference positions decisive for the coding can also be similarly attached counter sunk in holes. This means that in the device as per the invention the lock cylinder need not be constructed in a space-consuming manner as in the state-of-art technology, but the space of the inner end of the lock cylinder, where the switching unit was arranged so far, can be used for other purposes.<br>
Further measures and the advantages of the invention can be seen in the subclaims, in the<br>
accompanying<br>
following descriptions and the drawings. In the drawings the invention is shown in the form of a diagram in a design example. The following are shown:<br>

positions of fig. 2a, 2b and the working positions of fig. 3a to 5c; and Fig.8:  A part of a second design form of the lock cylinder as per the invention.<br>
The device as per the invention includes, on the one hand, a lock cylinder 10 as shown in figures la to 5c and, on the other hand, an electronic evaluator 20 whose principle construction is shown in fig. 7. Already the lock cylinder 10 includes not only mechanical but also electrically effective components.<br>
The lock cylinder consists of a cylinder core 11 and a cylinder housing 12. While the cylinder housing 12 is fixed to a particular location in a chassis 30 of a vehicle, the cylinder core 11 is pivotally supported in the cylindrical housing 12. The cylinder core includes in the interior initially chambers for usual, spring-loaded tumblers 13, of which only one is indicated in fig. la. The cylinder housing 12 has as usual stop channels not shown in details, into which the tumblers 13 generally grip in and prevent rotation of the cylinder core 11 in the direction of the arrow 14 of fig. la arround the cylinder axis 15 indicated by dash-dots. The cylinder core 11 also has another key channel 16 as one can see in fig. lb and lc, which if required, as one can see in fig. 2a and 2b, serves the purpose of taking up a key 17 and finally a radial chamber 18 in which a slide 31 is arranged, which is subjected to the force 32 of a spring 33 loading it.<br>
The figures la to lc show a starting rotation position of the cylinder core 11. This rotation position is illustrated in fig. lb by the auxiliary line 50. In this case, a locking strip 40 is radially driven out and grips with its external working ends 42 into a housing groove 43; it works like a tumbler and blocks, as shown in fig. lb, a rotation of the cylinder core 11. The lock strip 40 is in a "locked position" in fig. la to lc. If one properly inserts the key 17 into the key channel 16 as shown in figures 2a and 2b, then above the control faces 37 provided on the key profile, not only the mentioned tumblers 13 get sorted out on to the cross-section of the cylinder core 11, which leads to a locking of cylinder core 11, but also the slide 31 gets pressed back against the spring force 32 acting on it and is taken back to the position as one can see from fig. 2b, where a recess 34 provided in the slide 31 comes in alignment with the control end 41 of a lock strip 40.<br><br>
5<br>
Fig. 2b shows the same starting rotation position 50 of the cylinder core 11 as in fig. 1b, as one can recognise from the rotation postion of the lock strip 40   Besides, the lock strip 40 is spring-loaded in the direction of the arrow 44. The spring agent causing this is not shown in further details in the figure. While the already mentioned radial alignment exists, the control end 41 of the lock strip 40 cannot run into the recess 34. Then the lock strip-working end 42 is removed from the housing groove 43. Consequently, with the key 17 inserted, the blockade created so far by the lock strip 40 is removed, the lock strip is now in its "released position" and the cylinder core 11 is rotatable by activating the key in the direction of the arrow 14. Depending on the extent of the rotation 14, the cylinder core 11 reaches three defined rotation position 51, 52, 53, which release certain electrical functions in the device as per the invention and therefore, as already mentioned at the beginning, should be called "working positions". For reasons of better clarity, these working positions are not arranged at equal, but in exaggeratedly large angular sections to one another, which is illustrated by the auxiliary lines 51, 52, 53. The positions of these auxiliary lines can be obtained from the respective rotation position of the lock strip 40.<br>
In the present design example one is dealing with a socalled ignition starting switch in a vehicle. Only when its cylinder core 11 is in the starting rotation position 50 as shown in figures la to lc, it is possible to insert the key 17 into the key channel 16, which is illustrated in figures 2a and 2b, or to take it out again. Only in this starting rotation position 50 are tumblers 13 with the mentioned locking channels in the housing 12 radially aligned and can be moved radially. Without the key having been properly inserted into the starting rotation position 50, the vehicle electrical panel is switched off. In the case of this invention, as long as the proper key 17 has not been completely pushed into the cylinder core 11, i.e. in the situation as shown in figures 1 to lc, the evaluator 20 will also be rendered inactive. In that case the evaluator is dead even in case of a manipulated current supply and not in the position to carry out any kind of electrical control functions. Through insertion of key 17, according to figures 2a and 2b, the evaluator is "activated" in the invention and becomes useful for further functions. This can be realized with the help of the present invention by means of a special design of the lock strip 40.<br>
In the device as per the invention, the lock strip 40 is made of a magnetic material 45 which makes the lock strip 40 into a radially movable "permanent magnet". Use of magnetic materials 45 in the lock strip 40 is illustrated in the drawings by a light dotted shading. A first<br><br>
6<br>
sensor HI is allocated to this permanent magnet 40, which is fixed in a suitable support 35 from the cylinder housing 12. The sensor Hl is a Hall-element, which is arranged in the zone of the cylinder housing 12 marked as 38 in fig. la. At an axial displacement 29, a further support 36 for a further sensor H2 is foreseen in the cylinder housing 12, which is also similarly a Hall-element. The position of both these sensors HI, H2 is drawn dash-dotted in fig. la, from which their position in both housing zone becomes 38, 39 clear   In the starting rotation position 50 there is no magnet on the sensor H2, as one can see from fig. lc. Both sensors HI, H2 are connected with their output 21, 22 to the common evaluator 20 as shown in fig. 7. This determines in this case at the sensor output line 21 of HI the magnetic field of the lock strip 40 driven out radially as shown in fig. lb and no signal at the output line 22 of H2. This situation is recognised by the evaluator 20 as a defined code which leaves the panel electronic system inactive in this case. This situation, "yes/no"-code is drawn in the topmost line of the code table depicted in fig. 6.<br>
If the key 17 is now inserted as shown in figures 2a, 2b, then the lock strip 40 reaches its prescribed released position, where the distance to the Hall-generator HI gets increased. This makes itself noticeable towards the sensor HI in a clear reduction of the magnetic field, which is interpreted by the evaluator as "no-signal". The evaluator 20 does not determine any signal even in the sensor H2. This situation is remarked in the second line of the code table in fig. 6. The transition of the original "yes/no" as per figures la to lc in the code "no/no" shown in figures 2a, 2b causes the evaluated 20 to come to the conclusion that the proper key has been inserted. The evaluator 20 activates over a data line the corresponding units in the vehicle, like a board computer, which works oa corresponding control devices, e.g. a path travel barrier. Although it is illustrated in fig. 7 by a first starting line 23, this could also take place with the help of a common bus line replacing all the starting lines 23 to 26, which conducts the digital data generated by the evaluator through the code on to a central electric unit in the vehicle The evaluator 20 is provided with a supply current 27 as shown in fig. 7 and connected to the earth by the line 28.<br>
As can be seen from the figures lb and lc, further permanent magnets 55 are provided in the corresponding axial zones 58, 59 of the cylinder core 11 which are not radially movable like the lock strip 40, but are introduced in a fixed manner in suitable recesses 54 in the circumference face. The permanent magnets 55 could thus lie bound to the circumference face of the cylinder core 11. These permanent magnets 55 are highlighted in the drawings by dotted<br><br>
7<br>
shadings. With the given design of the lock cylinder 10, the permanent magnets 55 have a somewhat higher magnetic field strength than the magnetic material 45 constructing the lock strip 40. This is illustrated in the drawing by means of dotted shadings of different intensities In the present case, in each of the two axial zones 58, 59 two such location-fixed permanent magnets 55 are foreseen and that too at defined circumference points 46, 47, 48, 49 of the cylinder core 11 to be described in more details. These are selected conforming to the rotation angles between the stating rotation position 50 and the three further working positions 51, 52. 53 to one another, as one can see if one considers the further figures 3a to 5c.<br>
In figures 3 a to 3 c the cylinder core 11 has come to a first working position 51 by a key rotation 14, in which on application on to an ignition starting switch in the device, the vehicle electric panel gets switched on. One calls this working position 51 also "radio position". In case of an ignition starting switch, one speaks in this working position 51 of a current supply of a "clamp R" of the accessory switching unit. This working position 51 of the cylinder core 11 is determined by rest elements not shown in more details and can be felt on rotating the key 14. In this rotation position, the lock strip 40 has become even further distant from the sensor Hl, which is why it does not give any signal to the evaluator 20 as one can see in the third line of the code table fig. 6. In the adjacent axial zone 59 of the cylinder core lla permanent magnet 55 has however got radially alinged with the sensor H2. This permanent magnet 55 is situated on a circumference position 48 of this zone 59, which on turning comes into the working position 51 in the vicinity of the sensor H2. Through its sensor output 22, the evaluator 20 gets a signal, as one can see from the third line of the code table in fig. 6. By receiving of the code "no/yes" the evaluated 20 singularly determines this first working position 51 of the cylinder core 11. As the evaluator works like an electronic switching unit, it gives the corresponding control comands to the unit or to the board computer controlling this unit. This is illustrated on the basis of fig. 7, in that now a control signal is given over the second starting line 24. In technical language this means that the "clamp R" gets activated.<br>
In figures 4a and 4c the cylinder core 11 has been further turned to such an extent as per the arrow 14, that a second working position has been attained. In both the axial zones 58, 59 of the cylinder core there are circumference points denoted by 47 and 49 which are then aligned with both the sensors Hl, H2 in the cylinder housing 12, further permanent magnets 55. Even this working position 52 is noticeable due to rest elements which can be felt on turning 14 of the key 17. The evaluator 20 in this case detects a signal at both sensor outputs 21, 22, as one<br><br>
8<br>
can see in the fourth line of the code table in fig. 6   With the help of this determined code "yes/yes" the evaluator 20 identifies the rotating position of the cylinder core 11 as second working position and gives a corresponding control signal to the now effectively usable aggregate unit of the vehicle. For an ignition starting switch, this second working position is generally responsible for the ignition clearance of the engine. This is symbolized in the diagram of fig. 7 by a third starting line 25 which is now controlled. Traditionally, one speaks in the case of an ignition starting switch of a "clamp 15" on the switching unit, which is to be electrically fed with current in this working position.<br>
In the figures 5a and 5c the cylinder core 11 has been turned to such an extent as per the arrow 14, that a third defined working position 53 has been reached. This third working position 53 can be determined by a rotation and impact which becomes effective on the cylinder core 11. In this case, only at the circumference points 46 in the axial zone 58 of the cylinder core belonging to the sensor HI, there is a permanent magnet 55, whereas in the other axial zone 59 appears an empty circumference point of the cylinder core 11. Thereby only the first sensor HI determines a signal which reaches the evaluator 20 through the sensor output 21. The sensor H2 does not deliver any signal. In this case, the evaluator 20 determines a code "yes/no" according to the last line in code table in fig. 6.<br>
There has already been such a code in the first line in fig. 6, which has been described on the basis of fig. la to lc. There however, the cylinder core 11 was still in the starting rotation position, where the evaluator 20 was still inactive. There the key 17 was not yet inserted and the cylinder core 11 was blocked by the lock strip 40. In the case of the figures 5a to 5c however, the evaluator 20 is activated and hence identifies this code "yes/no" clearly as the third working position of the cylinder core 11. This conforms, if the device is used on an ignition starter switch, generally to the electrical function "starting" of a corresponding switching unit, where the combustion engine in the vehicle gets started. One speaks in this case of an activation of "clamp 50". In the present invention, the evaluator 20 renders a fourth starting line 26 effective as shown in the scheme in fig. 7.<br>
The evaluator 20 working as an electronic switch unit activates in this case the starter in the vehicle. Usually the cylinder core 11 of an ignition starter switch is under the effect of a rotation impulse spring, which endeavours to automatically bring the cylinder core 11 into the second working position of figures 4a to 4c after release of the key 17   The evaluator 20<br><br>
9<br>
determines also the last mentioned on the basis of the code "yes/yes" which can be seen from fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a fragmentary part of a lock cylinder 10' in an alternative design as per the invention. The difference with respect to the already described first design example is that, in each axial zone 38 where a sensor H2 is sitting in the cylinder housing, a ring or ring segment 56 made of magnetizable material is arranged in the cylinder core 11'   On that particular circumference position of the cylinder core 11', on which the permanent magnets 55' shown in fig. 8 which are supposed to be determined as a code, the material is subjected to a polarized magnetization. A sensor H2 then determines the magnetic fields at defined ring sections 57, and the evaluator 20 from that again calculates respective working positions with the help of the code. The ring section 57 acting as permanent magnet 55' in fig. 8 is illustrated by a dotted shading. In fig. 8, the radial alignment of this ring section 57 made relevant due to magnetization, with a sensor H2 is shown. This corresponds to the first working position of the cylinder core 11' shown in figures 3a to 3c.<br>
The design of the lock cylinder 10' as per fig. 8 enables initially prefabrication of all cylinder cores - independent of the desired code -. The arrangement of the permanent magnet 55' conforming to the individual coding of the rotation positions of the cylinder core 11' then takes place by means of corresponding magnetization 55' of the concerned ring sections 57. One could carry out magnetization on the defined ring sections 57 of the rings or ring segments 56, or also execute it before installing these in the cylinder 11'.<br>
It is obvious that the number of sensors HI and H2 and their arrangement depending on the case of application, could also be defined differently. This holds good also for the numbers and the position of permanent magnets. If required, one can do away with the use of a lock strip 40 movable radially by the key 17 or design this lock strip 40 to be of not magnetic material. In the present invention, the lock strip 40, on account of the magnetic material 45, signals to the evaluator 20, whether the right key has been inserted in the cylinder core 11 or not   This is used for activation and deactivation of the evaluator 20 of the board computer or the central electric system. The permanent magnets 55' originating in the magnetic field strength of the individual permanent magnet 55 or through magnetization, could have a magnetic field strength or magnetic field direction different from one another, which could be taken into account and also evaluated by the sensors Hl, H2. With these measures, the variation<br><br>
10<br>
possibilities of the code get significantly increased   One could then already arrange sufficient information in an axial zone 38 and/or 39 through different magnets 55 or magnetizations 55' with respect to direction and/or strength of the magnetic field, in order to be able to determine the respective individual working position 51, 52, 53 of the cylinder core 11 or 11' with the help of a single sensor Hl or H2. In this case, only the number of sensors and the differences of the permanent magnets at these specific circumference positions of the cylinder 11 or 11' vary.<br>
In the device as per the invention, no components are required at the inner end 19 of the lock cylinder 10 shown in fig. la, for a switching unit to be controlled by it. This space can be utilized for arranging other important components in the vehicle.<br><br>

radially movable lock strip (40) in the cylinder core (11)  which<br>
in  the  removed key position (17) is held in a  locked  position<br>
radially  protruding beyond the cylinder circumference, where  it<br>
grips  into a groove (43) provided in the cylinder  housing  (12)<br>
and  prevents  a  rotation, which however  reaches  into  a  sunk<br>
release position in case of properly inserted key (17), where  it<br>
releases  the housing groove (43) and allows a cylinder  rotation<br>
(14)  with  the  key  (17),  wherein  the  lock  strips  (40)  is<br>
magnetizable  or  is itself a permanent magnet (45), to  which  a<br>
strip sensor (Hi) addressing its magnetic field is allocated, and<br>
 the  strip  sensor (H1) sits against that inner position  of  the<br><br>

The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the sensors (H1,H2) address different magnetic field strengths and magnetic field directions of the permanent magnets (55,55') arranged at diverse circumference points and different from one another, which are registered by the evaluator (20) as different codes.<br>
Dated this 30th day of September 1997<br><br>
In a device with a key-operated lock cylinder (10) and a switching unit, a certain electrical function in a vehicle or similar object is supposed to be rendered effective by means of a key rotation. The invention provides arrangement of at least two sensors (H1) in the cylinder housing of the lock cylinder in longitudinally displaced zones from one another,whose sensor outputs are connected to a common evaluator. The cylinder core has in corresponding axial zones several permanent magnets at definite circumference points, which are selected such that for different working position of the cylinder core, the evaluator determines different codings at the sensor outputs different to one another and through the codes clearly identifies the respective working position. The evaluator works like an electronic switch which, on the basis of the determined code, releases the electrical function belonging to the respective working position.<br></td>
