The present invention concerns a new multi-step process for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds from 1,2-epoxides, in particular 1,2-diamino compounds useful as inhibitors of viral or bacterial neuraminidases, a new step of that multi-step process for preparing 2-aminoalcohols from 1,2-epoxides, a new step for the transformation of a 2-aminoalcohol into a 1,2-diamino compound as well as specific intermediates useful in that multi-step process.<br>
PCT Patent Publication No. 96/26933 describes a large class of compounds useful as inhibitors of viral or bacterial neuraminidases and their preparation. These compounds comprise a six membered partially unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, which can be substituted by several different substituents.<br>
PCT Patent Publication No. 98/07685 discloses various methods for preparing compounds of the above class which are cyclohexene carboxylate derivatives.<br>
A particularly interesting compound is (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-l-ene-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (C.U. Kim et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc, 1997, 119, 681-690). A method of preparation of that 1,2-diamino compound in 10 steps starting from shikimic acid, or in 12 steps starting from quinic acid, is described by J.C. Rohloff et al., j. Org. Chem.,1998, 63, 4545-4550. This method involves a final 4-step reaction sequence from the 1,2-epoxide (lS,5R,6R)-5-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester via three potentially highly toxic and explosive azide intermediates. Dedicated know-how and expensive equipment is required<br><br>
to perform such a process. In a technical process use of azide reagents and azide intermediates should be avoided.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention therefore was to find an azide-free process for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds from 1,2-epoxides.<br>
That problem has been solved by the invention as described below and as defined in the appended claims.<br>

or a substituent of an amino group,with the proviso that not both R5 and R6 are H<br><br><br>
d)	acylating the free amino function in position 1 to form an acylated 1,2-diamino<br>
compound of formula<br><br>
e)	releasing the amino group in position 2 and, if necessary,<br>
further transforming the resulting 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt.<br>

'!3	A<br>
alkanoyl group and therefore preferred meaning for R is acetyl and for R is H.<br>
Most preferred 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) or 4,5-diamino-shikimic acid derivative of formula (VII) therefore is the (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-l-ene-carboxylic acid ethyl ester or the (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-l-ene-carboxylic acid ethyl ester phosphate (1:1). Most preferred 1,2-epoxide of formula (II) or cyclohexene oxide of formula (VIII) therefore is the (lS,5R,6R)-5-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester.<br>
Step a)<br>
Step a) comprises treating a 1,2-epoxide of formula (II) with an amine of formula R'NHR' and the formation of the respective 2-aminoalcohol of formula (III).<br>
The amine of formula R5NHR6 of step (a) is a primary or secondary amine which shows reactivity for opening the 1,2-epoxide ring.<br>

Straight chained or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms preferably is allyl or an analog thereof such as allyl or an allyl group which is substituted on theα-, β-or γ-carbon by one lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl group. Suitable examples are e.g. 2-methylallyl, 3,3-dimethylallyl, 2-phenylallyl, or 3-methylallyl. Preferred amines of formula R5NHR6 with the meaning of a straight chained or branched alkenyl of 1 to 6 C-atoms group therefore are allylamine, diallylamine or 2-methylallylamine, whereby allylamine is the most preferred.<br>
Optionally substituted benzyl preferably is benzyl or benzyl analogs which are either substituted on the α-carbon atom with one or two lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl groups or substituted on the benzene ring with one or more lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, lower-alkoxy or nitro groups. Suitable examples areα-methylbenzyl,α-phenylbenzyl, 2-methoxybenzyl, 3-methoxybenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 4-nitrobenzyl or 3-methylbenzyl. Preferred amines of formula R5NHR6 with the meaning of an optionally substituted benzyl group are benzylamine, dibenzylamine, methylbenzylamine, 2-methoxybenzylamine, 3-methoxybenzylamine or 4-methoxybenzylamine, whereby benzylamine is the most preferred.<br>
Trisubstituted silyl methyl preferably is silyl methyl trisubstituted with aryl, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl and/or lower alkynyl groups. Suitable examples are trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, diphenylmethylsilyl, phenyldimethylsilyl or tert.-butyldimethylsilyl. Preferred amine of formula R5NHR6 with the meaning of tri-substituted silyl methyl is the trimethylsilyl methylamine.<br>
Heterocyclyl methyl preferably is heterocyclyl methyl wherein either the methyl group is substituted with one or two lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl groups or the heterocyclic ring is substituted with one or more lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or lower alkoxy groups. Suitable examples are furfuryl or picolyl.<br>
Most preferred amine of formula R5NHR6 is allylamine.<br>
The amine of formula R5NHR6 is generally used in a molar amount of 1.0 to 3.0 equivalents, preferably of 1.5 to 2.5 equivalents, based on one equivalent of the 1,2-epoxide of formula (II).<br>
Step (a) can be performed without a catalyst under normal or elevated pressure, however, the reaction time of step (a) can in general be significantly reduced in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Suitably the catalyst is a metal catalyst or a magnesium halide.<br><br>
Convenient metal catalysts known to catalyze ring opening reactions of 1,2-epoxides with amines e.g. are lanthanide compounds such as lanthanide trifluoromethanesulfonates like Yb(OTf)3, Gd(OTf)3 and Nd(0Tf)3 (M. Chini et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35,433-436), samarium iodides (P. Van de Weghe, Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 1649-1652) or other metal catalysts such as amide cuprate reagents (Y. Yamamoto, J. Chem. Soc, Chem, Commun., 1993, 1201-1203) and Ti(0-i-Pr)4 (M. Caron et al, J. Org. Chem., 1985, 50, 1557 and M. Muller, et al, J. Org. Chem., 1998, 68, 9753).<br>
As a rule the ring opening with metal catalysts is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent e.g. in tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 20°Cand 150'°C<br>
It was found that the magnesium halides are the preferred catalysts for the ring opening of 1,2-epoxides with amines. The term "magnesium halide derivative" here denotes anhydrous or hydrated magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide or magnesium iodide, or an etherate, in particular a dimethyl etherate, a diethyl etherate, a dipropyl etherate, or a diisopropyl etherate thereof.<br>
Magnesium bromide diethyl etherate is the most preferred catalyst.<br>
The magnesium halide is suitably used in a molar amount of 0.01 to 2.0 equivalents, preferably of 0.15 to 0.25 equivalents, based on one equivalent of the 1,2-epoxide of formula (II).<br>
Suitable solvent for the magnesium halide catalysis is a protic solvent such as ethanol or methanol, or preferably an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, tert.-butyl methyl ether, diisopropylether, isopropylacetate, ethylacetate, methylacetate, acetonitrile, benzene, toluene, pyridine, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, N-methylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide or mixtures thereof.<br>
The aprotic solvent is preferably selected from tetrahydrofuran, diisopropylether, tert.-butyl methyl ether, acetonitrile, toluene or a mixture thereof, most preferably is a mixture of tert.-butyl methyl ether and acetonitrile.<br>
Magnesium halide catalysis is advantageously carried out at temperatures between 0°C and 20°C, preferably between 50°C and 150°C.<br>
The respective 2-aminoalcohol of formula (III) can after the reaction has been finished be isolated and if so desired purified by methods known to the skilled in the art.<br><br>
Step b)<br>
Step b) comprises converting the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (III) into a 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
The conversion in step b), is dependent on the residue R5 and R6.<br>
If R5 and R6 independently of each other are straight chained or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms, the conversion is an isomerization/hydrolysis performed in the presence of a metal catalyst.<br>
If R5 and R6 independently of each other are optionally substituted benzyl or heterocyclyl methyl, the conversion is a hydrogenolysis performed with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst or<br>
If R5 and R6 independently of each other is tri-substituted silyl methyl, the conversion is an oxidative cleavage.<br>
The fact that the preferred meaning for R5 and R6 are straight chained or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms as outlined above at step a) isomerization/hydrolysis is the preferred method for the conversion in step b).<br>
Isomerization/hydrolysis accordingly takes place in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst, expediently a precious metal catalyst such as Pt, Pd or Rh either applied on an inert support such as charcoal or alumina, or in complexed form. Preferred catalyst is 5 to 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C).<br>
The catalyst is suitably used in an amount of 2 to 30 wt.%, preferably, 5 to 20wt:.% relating to the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (III).<br>
The isomerization/hydrolysis is advantageously carried out in an aqueous solvent. The solvent itself can be protic or aprotic. Suitable protic solvents are e.g. alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. Suitable aprotic solvent is e.g. acetonitrile or dioxane.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably chosen in the range of 20°C and 150^C.<br>
It was found that isomerization/hydrolysis is preferably effected in the presence of a primary amine.<br>
Primary amines suitably used are ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, or suitable derivatives of these primary amines mentioned hereinbefore. A particularly interesting primary amine is      ethanolamine.<br><br>
The primary amine is suitably used in an amount of 1.0 to 1.25 equivalents, preferably of 1.05 to 1.15 equivalents relating to the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (III).<br>
As mentioned above , if R5 and R6 independently of each other are optionally substituted benzyl or heterocyclyl methyl, the conversion is a hydrogenolysis performed in the presence of a metal catalyst with hydrogen. Hydrogenolysis conditions are well known in the art and described e.g. in Green, T., "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Chapter 7, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,1991, 364-365.<br>
Hydrogenolysis accordingly takes place in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst, expediently a precious metal catalyst such as Pt, Pd or Rh either applied on an inert support such as charcoal or alumina, or in complexed form. Preferred catalyst is 5 to 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C). The catalyst is suitably used in an amount of 2 to 30 wt.%, preferably 5 to 20 wt.% relating to the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (III).<br>
Hydrogenolysis advantageously is carried out in an aqueous solvent. The solvent itself can be protic or aprotic. Suitable protic solvents are e.g. alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. Suitable aprotic solvent is e.g. acetonitrile or dioxane. The reaction temperature is preferably chosen in the range of 20°C and 150°C.<br>
As mentioned above, if R5 and R6, independently of each other, is tri-substituted silyl methyl, the conversion is an oxidative cleavage.<br>
Expediently the reaction is performed in the presence of a haloimide.<br>
Haloimides suitable for this reaction are N-chloro-succinimide, N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorobenzene sulfonamide (chloramine-T).<br>
The reaction can be performed in the presence of an inert solvent at temperatures of 20°C to l50°C.<br>
In order to completely hydrolyze any imines that may have formed in step b) the reaction mixture is usually treated with an acid e.g. with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid.<br>
Step c)<br>
Step c) comprises the transformation of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV) into a 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V)<br>
In detail step c) comprises the steps,<br><br>
(cl) introducing an amino group substituent into the 2-aminoaIcohol of formula (IV) obtained in step (b),<br>
(c2) transforming the hydroxy group into a leaving group, and<br>
(c3) splitting off the substituent of the amino group and transforming the reaction product using an amine of formula R NHR , wherein R5 and R6 are as above into a 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V).<br>
Step cl)<br>
The term "substituted amino group" used as stated above refers to any substituents conventionally used to hinder the reactivity of the amino group. Suitable substituents are described in Green T., "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Chapter 7, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,1991, 315-385.<br>
Particularly interesting is the conversion of the amino group with a carbonyl group containing compound to form an imine, a so called "Schiff base".<br>
Also acyl substituents which are formed by treating of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV) with an acylating agent are of interest.<br>
Formation of a Schiff base is the preferred method for the conversion of the free amino group into the substituted amino group of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
Carbonyl compounds suitable to form a Schiff base are either aldehydes or ketones. Both the aldehydes and the ketones can be aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic, preferably aromatic.<br>
Examples of suitable aliphatic aldehydes are propionaldehyde, 2-methylpentenal, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, pivaldehyde, ethyl glyoxylate and chloral. An example of an alicyclic aldehyde is cyclopropan carbaldehyde. Examples of suitable aromatic aldehydes are furfural, 2-pyridinecarboxylaldehyde, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, a benzaldehyde sulfonate, a furfural sulfonate, and benzaldehyde. A particularly interesting aromatic aldehyde is benzaldehyde.<br>
Examples of suitable aliphatic ketones are 1,1-dimethoxyacetone and 1,1-diethoxyacetone. Examples of suitable alicyclic ketones are cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone.<br><br>
2-ethyl cyclohexanone and 2-methyl-cyclopentanone. An example of an aromatic ketone is acetophenone.<br>
Preferred carbonyl containing compound is benzaldehyde.<br>
The carbonyl containing compound is expediently used in an amount of 1.0 to 1.50, preferably 1.10 to 1.40 equivalents relating to the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
Formation of the Schiff base is advantageously performed in a protic or aprotic solvent, preferably in an aprotic solvent.<br>
Suitable aprotic solvents are for example tetrahydrofiiran, dioxane, tert.-butyl methyl ether, diisopropylether, isopropylacetate, ethylacetate, methylacetate, acetonitrile, benzene, toluene, pyridine, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, N-methylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. A preferred aprotic solvent is tert.-butyl methyl ether.<br>
The water formed is usually removed by azeotropic distillation.<br>
Formation of the Schiff base is advantageously carried out at temperatures between 30°C and 180°C, preferably between 60°C and 140°C.<br>
If step cl) comprises acylation, as mentioned above, the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV) is transformed into a 2-acyl aminoalcohol.<br>
The acylating agent can be a carboxylic acid, or an activated derivative thereof, such as an acyl halide, a carboxylic acid ester or a carboxylic acid anhydride. Suitable acylating agents are acetylchloride, trifluoracteylchloride, benzoyl chloride or acetic anhydride, A preferred acyl group is formyl. Suitable formylating agent therefore is e.g. a formic acid mixed anhydride such as for example formic acid acetic acid anhydride, or a formic acid ester, such as ethyl formate or methyl formate or a formic acid active ester such as cyanomethyl formate.<br>
The acylating agent is suitably used in an amount of 1.0 to 1.3, preferably 1.1 to 1.2 equivalents relating to the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
The choice of solvent is not critical as long as it does not interfere with the reactants. It was found that e.g. ethylacetate is a suitable solvent. The reaction can however also be performed without solvent i.e. in the presence of the respective acylating agent applied in excess.<br>
Reaction temperature usually is in the range of-20°C to 100°C.<br><br>
Step c2)<br>
Step (c2) comprises transforming the hydroxy group into a leaving group, thereby forming an 0-substituted 2-aminoalcohol.<br>
Compounds and methods for effecting this transformation are well known in the art and described e.g. in "Advanced Organic Chemistry", ed. March J., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, 353-357.<br>
It was found that the hydroxy group is preferably transformed into a sulfonic acid ester.<br>
Agents commonly used for producing sulfonic acid esters e.g. are the halogenides or the anhydrides of the following sulfonic acids: methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, p-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, p-bromobenzenesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.<br>
Preferred sulfonylating agent is a halogenide or the anhydride of methane sulfonic acid such as methane sulfonylchloride.<br>
The sulfonylating agent is expediently added in an amount of 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
Usually the reaction in step c2) takes place in an inert solvent, preferably in the same solvent which has been used in the previous step cl) and at a reaction temperature of -20°C to 100°C.<br>
Step c3)<br>
Step (c3) comprises splitting off the substituent of the amino group and transforming the reaction product using an amine of formula R5NHR6 , wherein R5 and R6 are as above into 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V).<br>
In the course of this reaction an aziridine intermediate of formula<br><br><br>
wherein R1,R1,R2 and R2 are as above<br>
is formed. This aziridine can be isolated , but as a rule without its isolation, is further transformed to the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V).<br>
The amine of formula R5NHR6 is the very same as applied in step a). Also the same preferences are applicable as for the amine in step a). Accordingly most preferred amine of formula R5NHR6 used for step c3) is allylamine.<br>
The course of the reaction in step c3) and the respective reaction conditions mainly depend on the kind of protection of the amino group in step c2).<br>
Having a Schiff base the transformation is directly effected with the amine of formula R NHR , whereby having an acetyl group, prior to the transformation with the amine of formula R5 NHR6 a deacylation treatment has to take place first.<br>
In case of a Schiff base, the amine of formula R5NHR6 is used in an amount of at least two equivalents, preferably of 2.0 to 5.0, more preferably of 2.5 to 4.0 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
The solvent used in this reaction step (c3) is as a rule the same as of the previous step c2). Accordingly protic or aprotic solvents, preferably aprotic solvents, such as for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, tert.-butyl methyl ether, diisopropylether, isopropylacetate, ethylacetate, methylacetate, acetonitrile, benzene, toluene, pyridine, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, N-methylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide can be used. A preferred solvent is tert.-butyl methyl ether.<br>
In case of a Schiff base the conversion is advantageously carried out at a temperature of 60°C to 170°C, preferably of 90°C to 130°C and applying normal pressure to 10 bars .<br>
In case the substituted amino group is acyl, prior to the treatment with the amine of formula R5 NHR6 deacylation has to take place as mentioned above.<br><br>
Deacylation can easily be effected under acidic conditions e.g. using sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
Thereby the respective sulfonate or sulfate salt of the O-substituted 2-aminoalcohol is formed.<br>
The amine of the formula R5NHR6 is then suitably used in an amount of 1.0 to 5.0 equivalents, preferably of 2.0 to 4.0 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IV).<br>
The choice of solvents is about the same as for the conversion of the Schiff base, preferably ethyl acetate or tert.-butyl methyl ether.<br>
The reaction temperature is chosen between 60°C and 170°C, preferably between 90°C and 130°C and the pressure is selected between normal pressure and 10 bar.<br>
When operating with a Schiff base step c) thus can efficiently be performed in a one pot synthesis without isolating the intermediates.<br>
Step d)<br>
Step d) comprises the acylation of the free amino function in position 1 to form an acylated 1,2-diamino compound of formula (VI).<br>
Acylation can be effected under strong acidic conditions by using acylating agents known to the skilled in the art. Acylating agent can be an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, or an activated derivative thereof, such as an acyl halide, a carboxylic acid ester or a carboxylic acid anhydride. Suitable acylating agent preferably is an acetylating agent such as acetylchloride, trifluoracteylchloride or acetic anhydride. Suitable aromatic acylating agent is benzoylchloride. Strong acids suitably used e.g. are mixtures of methane sulfonic acid and acetic acid or sulfuric acid and acetic acid.<br>
Acylation however can also take place under non acidic conditions using e.g. N-acetyl imidazole or N-acetyl-N-methoxy acetamide.<br>
Preferably however the acylation takes place under acidic conditions using a mixture of 0.5 to 2.0 equivalents of acetic anhydride, 0 to 15.0 equivalents of acetic acid and 0 to 2.0 equivalents of methanesulfonic acid in ethyl acetate.<br>
An inert solvent such as tert.-butyl methyl ether may be added, it is however also possible to run the reaction without addition of any solvent.<br><br>
The temperature is as a rule chosen in the range of-20°C to 100°C.<br>
Step e)<br>
Step e) comprises releasing the amino group in position 2 and, if necessary, further transforming the resulting 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt.<br>
Releasing the amino group i.e.removal of the substituent of the amino group in position 2 takes place following the same methods and applying the same conditions as described in step b).<br>
The conversion in step e), accordingly is also dependent on the residue R and R . Therefore,<br>
if R and R independently of each other are straight chained or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms, the conversion is a hydrolysis performed in the presence of a metal catalyst,<br>
if R and R independently of each other are optionally substituted benzyl or heterocyclyl methyl, the conversion is a hydrogenolysis performed with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst or<br>
if R5 and R6 independently of each other is tri-substituted silyl methyl, the conversion is an oxidative cleavage.<br>
The same preferences as for step b) are valid for step e).<br>
For any further details reference is made to step b).<br>
As a rule the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) can be isolated e.g. by evaporation and crystallization, but it is preferably kept in e.g. an ethanolic solution and then further transformed into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt following the methods described in J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem.,1998, 63,4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br><br>
The salt formation is effected in accordance with methods which are known per se and which are familiar to any person skilled in the art. Not only salts with inorganic acids, but also salts with organic acids come into consideration. Hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, nitrates, citrates, acetates, maleates, succinates, methansulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates and the like are examples of such salts.<br>
Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt is the 1:1 salt with phosphoric acid which can be formed preferably in ethanolic solution at a temperature of 50°C to<br>
