				<td>EMULSIFIABLE CONCENTRATES CONTAINING ADJUVANTS<br>
The present invention relates to stable emulsifiable concentrates comprising an oil adjuvant and at least one member selected from the group consisting of herbicidally active 2-[4[(5-chloro-3-fluoropyridin-2-yloxy)-phenoxy]-propionic acid derivatives and quinoline derivative safeners.<br>
The present invention also relates to herbicidal compositions for controlling grasses and weeds in crops of useful plants, especially in crops of maize and cereals, prepared from these emulsifiable concentrates, and to the use of such compositions in controlling weeds in crops of useful plants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of adjuvants for improving the biological activity and/or spray properties of pesticidal compositions is well known. However, certain components, e.g., active ingredients or antidotes, useful in pesticidal formulations are chemically unstable or have limited chemical stability. These stability issues can limit the ability to formulate pesticidal concentrates and restrict the use of additional components, such as adjuvants, in the concentrate formulations.<br>
There is a need for chemically stable formulations containing components having limited chemical stability. Further, it is desirable to have pesticidal concentrates containing "built-in" adjuvants in order to avoid having to add these adjuvants as a tank-mix component.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulations conventionally contain an active ingredient, one or more surfactants which act as emulsifiers upon dilution of the EC with water and a water immiscible solvent. Typical solvents for conventional EC formulations are aromatic hydrocarbons. These solvents have very low solubilities in water and a high capability of dissolving a wide range of active ingredients.<br>
Due to the presence of the solvent, many pesticides formulated as an EC have advantages such as a higher degree of systemicity and higher overall activity compared to the same pesticide formulated as a wettable powder (WP), water dispersible granule (WG) or suspension concentrate (SC).<br>
The observed efficacy of the combination of ingredients can sometimes be significantly higher than would be expected from the amounts of the individual ingredients<br>
used (synergism). The efficacy of the active components can often be improved by addition of other ingredients such as adjuvants.<br>
In view of increasing the ease and safety of handling and dosing of these adjuvants by the end-user and in view of avoiding unnecessary packaging material, it is desirable to develop concentrated formulations which already contain such adjuvants.<br>
US Patent No. 6,566,308 discloses EC formulations stabilized with a water-miscible polar aprotic solvent.<br>

Other suitable non-ionic surfactants are the water-soluble, 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups containing polyadducts of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, ethylene diamino polypropylene glycol and alkyl polypropylene glycol with 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, the substances normally contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylphenol polyethoxy ethanols, vegetable oil polyglycol ethers, polyadducts of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, tributyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol, octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol. Preferred are fatty acid esters of polyoxy ethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxy ethylene sorbitan trioleate.<br>
Preferably, the surfactant system according to the present invention consists of an anionic surfactant and one or two non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Cationic surfactants are preferably quaternary ammonium salts carrying, as N-substituent, at least one C&amp; -Cn alkyl radical and, as further substiruents, unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methyl sulfates or ethyl sulfates, for example stearyl trimethylammonium chloride or benzyl bis(2-chloroemyl)ethylammonium bromide.<br>
The amount of surfactant(s) depends on the particular active ingredients selected for the composition and the absolute and relative amounts of these desired. Suitable amounts of stabilizing system components selected from the classes or specific examples provided herein can be determined by routine experimentation, the test being that substantially no phase separation, sedimentation or flocculation is exhibited by the composition following storage at 20-25 °C for a period of 24 hours, or, for preferred embodiments, following a longer period of storage over a broader range of temperatures as indicated above. Typically the total concentration of all surfactants in the composition as a whole is about 1% to about 30% by weight, excluding the weight of counterions, if present.<br>
In computing relative amounts of surfactants present in a composition, the weight of water or other diluent supplied with a surfactant, if known, should be excluded. For example, WITCONATE® 79S of CK Witco Corporation contains 52% dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid triethanolamine salt. In a composition containing 1% WITCONATE® 79S, the concentration of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid triethanolamine salt should be computed as 0.52%.<br>
Suitable water-immiscible solvents are preferably selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, dialkylene glycol dialkyl ethers, ketones, alkyl esters of acetic acid or mixtures thereof.<br>
Aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane,-benzene, toluene, xylene, mineral oil or kerosene or substituted naphthalenes, mixtures of mono- and polyalkylated aromatics are commercially available under the registered trademarks Solvesso® and Shellsol® and Petrol Spezial®.   Preferred ketones include acetophenone. Representative alkyl esters of acetic acid include EXXATE™ fluids, such as EXXATE™ 800, available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX.<br>
A safener in accordance with the invention may, depending on the intended purpose, be used to pre-treat the seed material of the cultivated plant (dressing the seed or the seedlings) or may be incorporated into the soil before or after sowing. It may, however, also be applied, alone or together with the herbicide and the oil adjuvant, after the emergence of<br>
the plants. The treatment of the plants or seed with the safener can therefore, in principle, be<br>
effected independently of the time at which the herbicide is applied. The treatment of the<br>
i plants can, however, also be carried out by applying the herbicide, oil adjuvant and safener<br>
simultaneously. The rate of application of the safener in relation to the herbicide depends largely on the method of application. In the case of field treatment, which is effected either using a tank mixture with a combination of the safener and the herbicide or by the separate application of the safener and the herbicide, the ratio of herbicide to safener is generally from 100:1 to 1:10, preferably from 20:1 to 1:1. In the case of field treatment, from 0.001 to 1.0 kg of safener/ha, preferably from 0.001 to 0.25 kg of safener/ha, are generally applied.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide selective pesticidal compositions obtainable by diluting the emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention in a suitable amount of water to form an oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for the selective control of weeds in crops of useful plants, which method comprises treating the useful plants, their seeds or seedlings or the crop area thereof with the pesticidal compositions of the present invention.<br>
The ECs of the present invention may preferably be in a concentrated form whereas the end-user generally employs diluted compositions. Said compositions may be diluted to concentrations down to 0.01% of active ingredient (a.i.). The compositions are typically applied in amounts sufficient to deliver from about 0.006 to 0.6 kg a.i./ha.<br>
The composition according to the invention is suitable for all methods of application conventionally used in agriculture, e.g. pre-emergence application, post-emergence application and seed dressing. The compositions according to the invention are preferably used for post-emergence control of weeds.<br>
The composition according to the invention is suitable especially for-eontrolling weeds in crops of useful plants, such as cereals, rape, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantation crops, rice, maize and soybeans. Particularly preferred crops are maize, rice, soybeans and cereals such as wheat or barley. "Crops" are to be understood also to include those crops that have been made tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. The components used in the composition of the invention can be applied in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art, at various concentrations. The rate at which the herbicidal compositions are applied will depend upon the particular type of weed to be controlled, the degree of control required, and the timing and method of application.<br>
Crop areas are areas of land on which the cultivated plants are already growing or in which the seeds of those cultivated plants have been sown, and also areas of land on which it is intended to grow those cultivated plants.<br>
The weeds to be controlled may be either dicotyledonous or, preferably, monocotyledonous weeds, for example the monocotyledonous weeds Avena, Agrostis, Phalaris, Lolium, Bromus, Alopecurus, Setaria, Digitaria, Brachiaria, Echinochloa, Panicum, Sorghum hal./bic., Rottboellia, Cyperus, Brachiaria, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria and Sagittaria and the dicotyledonous weeds Sinapis, Chenopodium, Stellaria, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Matricaria, Papaver, Solanum, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthiurn, Amaranthus, Ipomoea and Chrysanthemum.<br>
Other active ingredients such as co-herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides and nematicides may be present in the emulsifiable concentrate or may be added as a tank-mix partner with the emulsifiable concentrate.<br>
These compositions may also comprise other auxiliaries such as chemical stabilizers, viscosity controlling agents, thickeners, binders, tackifiers, fertilizers and anti-foam agents.<br>
Suitable stabilizers include epoxidized animal or vegetable oils, such as epoxidized soybean oil.<br>
Representative anti-foam agents are silica, polydialkylsiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes, fluoroaliphatic esters or perfluoroalkylphosphonic/ perfluoroalkylphosphonic acids or the salts thereof and mixtures, thereof. Preferred are polydimethylsiloxanes.<br>
For a clearer understanding of the invention, specific examples are set forth below. These examples are merely illustrations and are not to be understood as limiting the scope and underlying principles of the invention in any way. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following examples and foregoing description.<br>
Preparation of Test Samples<br>
In order to demonstrate the effect of water on the stability of the compositions of the present invention, a series of emulsifiable concentrate formulations were prepared by dissolving clodinifop-propargyl, cloquintocet-mexyl, Atplus® 3 OOF surfactant blend and water in a mixture of methylated rape seed oil and Exxate 800 in the proportions (wt %)<br>
given in Table 1 below. The pH of the compositions when diluted to 1% concentration in water was measured by pH electrode.<br>
Samples of the emulsifiable concentrate compositions were placed in storage at a temperature of 70 °C, and the concentration of clodinofop-propargyl and cloquintocet-mexyl ingredients was measured over time by gas chromatographic techniques known in the art. Based on these measurements a half-life for each ingredient could be calculated.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Remove)  The half-life data of Table 1 indicate that the water content of the compositions strongly influence the chemical stability of the active ingredients during storage. The optimum chemical stability of the active ingredients is observed when the water content is maintained below about 3%.<br>
In order to demonstrate the effects of pH on the stability of the compositions of the present invention, emulsifiable concentrate formulations were prepared by dissolving clodinifop-propargyl, cloquintocet-mexyl, Atplus® 300F, AgRHOSpec 6713, Bio-Soft S-101 and water in a mixture of methylated rape seed oil, acetophenone and Exxate 800 in the proportions (wt %) given in Table 2 below.  The compositions exhibit a range of pH values when diluted to 1% concentration in water.<br>
