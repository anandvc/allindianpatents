The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>

WATER TREATMENT DEVICE<br>
Field of Technology.<br>
This invention relates to environment protection and to the field of purification and disinfection of industrial and domestic wastewater and water of surface sources from impurities of various kinds and characters and in particular to a treatment of a turbid aquatic medium in a flow.<br>
Background art<br>
The problem of environment protection is one of the most important problems, because all the time the need of a population for sufficient amounts of water of required quality is vitally important. Water from surface sources contains impurities of natural origin as well as various chemical pollutants (pesticides, phenols, products of mineral oil industry, salts of heavy metals and so on). Such situation is the sequence, among others, of emergency discharge of not fully treated industrial and domestic wastewaters into water basins. Technologies and installations used now for water treatment don't always provide necessary degree of purification and disinfection of the aquatic medium.<br>
A device for water treatment is known (see EP 0 655 417, 1995) that comprises bi-sectional housing with a unit to supply water for purification and removal of treated water.. The first section by stream contains an ultrasonic vibrator, and the second one contains a lamp of ultraviolet irradiation enclosed in quartz cover. Water to be purified is treated by ultrasonic vibrations in a circle duct of the first section and then it is treated by ultraviolet irradiation in the second section of the reactor. The disadvantage of this device is that the treatment of water is provided in two different separated zones separately by ultrasonic vibrations and ultraviolet irradiation. This causes significant ultrasonic energy consumption for cleaning of ultraviolet irradiator quartz cover from biological encrustations and salts precipitations. Advantages of the sole ultrasonic irradiator cannot be used to the full extent because the ultrasonic impact to aquatic medium is provided in a narrow duct and zones of ultrasonic field concentration are absent. The use of one only source of ultraviolet irradiation limits the productivity of the device and doesn't provide a sufficient purification degree.<br>
A device for aquatic medium treatment is known (see Patent RU 2067079,1996) that comprises a flowing through housing with units to supply water for purification and treated water discharge comprising one or more sections containing one or more ultrasonic transformers. One of the implementations of the known device is a straight cylinder housing with cylindrical ultrasonic transformer coaxially disposed inside. Aquatic medium to be treated is impacted by one or more fields of standing ultrasonic waves that causes the extraction (flocculation, sedimentation, agglomeration or coagulation) of ingredients or microorganisms that are dissolved, suspended or emulsified in aquatic medium with further separation of them. The disadvantage of this device is a low degree of disinfection of the treated aquatic medium because of partial only removal of pathogenic microflora located on the surface of solid particles, and also because of low level of acoustic power of ultrasonic vibrations used at the treatment.<br>
A device for water treatment is known (see Utility Model Certificate RU 13209, 2000) that comprises a cylindrical housing with units to supply water for treatment and the treated water discharge provided with openings in the bottom of the housing, transversal disk-like partitions with openings located therein and lamps of ultraviolet radiation covered with<br><br><br>
ultraviolet transparent material that are located in a parallel position to generatrix line ot that cylindrical housing on circumference and in the center. The device allows to increase the degree of the disinfection of the treated water but the walls of the housing and of the protective covers of ultraviolet lamps are exposed to biological encrustation and salts precipitation, especially when the device is used for highly turbid aquatic medium that decreases the productivity of the device and increases energy consumption per unit of the treated volume.<br>
A device for water treatment is known (see Patent US 5130031, 1992). Suspension that is treated in this device is impacted simultaneously by ultrasound and ultraviolet, however sources of ultraviolet irradiation are placed outside along the perimeter of the vessel in which suspension is treated. This decreases significantly the efficiency of the treatment, because small volumes of the treated suspension only are treated uniformly.<br>
A device for treatment aquatic medium that is known from PCT international application (see WO 00/58224, 2000) is mostly similar to the proposed device by its technical essence. It comprises a cylindrical housing with a lamp of ultraviolet irradiation with a protective quartz cover that is coaxially located inside the housing, a unit for aquatic medium supply for treatment, a unit of ultrasonic treatment and a unit of treated water discharge. This device in comparison with aforementioned ones allows simultaneously to increase a degree of purification and disinfection of the treated aquatic medium by ultrasound and ultraviolet in the unified acoustic field and to decrease biological encrustation and salts precipitation on the walls of the housing and on the protective cover of the lamp of ultraviolet irradiation. Disadvantages of this device are the following: limited volume of treated aquatic medium because of non¬uniform distribution of intensity of ultrasonic vibrations in the volume of the device and an increase of the exposition time required to provide better efficiency. Furthermore, several such devices have to be connected parallel to provide the necessary productivity that causes the increase of amount of metal required (i.e. specific metal quantity per unit) and energy consumption.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The invention is based on the problem of providing of a multifunctional universal device characterized by low amount of metal required and low energy consumption for treatment of raw water of any composition.<br>
Technical effect of the use of the proposed device consists in increasing of the purification degree of aquatic medium from organic, inorganic, toxic pollution and in increasing the disinfection degree of pathogenic microflora, with simultaneous decreasing of the treatment time and energy consumption.<br>
Furthermore, the device allows to prevent biological encrustation and salts precipitation on the inner surface of the device housing and on the surfaces of protective covers of ultraviolet lamps located inside said housing.<br>
The determined problem is solved and the technical effect is reached by that in the water treatment devise, comprising a cylindrical housing with units for water supply for treatment, for ultraviolet treatment, for ultrasonic treatment and for treated water discharge, said unit for ultraviolet treatment consists of at least two ultraviolet irradiators, provided with protective covers of the material transparent for ultraviolet irradiation, and located parallel with respect to the generatrix with the cylindrical housing along at least one concentric circle; said unit for ultrasonic treatment consists<br><br>
of two or more ultrasonic emitters, at that two ultrasonic emitters can be located just next to the base of said cylindrical housing in its axis, two or more ultrasonic emitters can be located in the axis of said housing equidistantly to each other; the device can be provided with groups of ultrasonic emitters located in equidistant lines along the axis of the housing said lines forming concentric circles of same or different diameters with centers of that circles on the axis of the housing; said groups of ultrasonic emitters and ultraviolet irradiators alternate in the direction from the axis of the housing to its inner surface; ultrasonic emitters are made replaceable in the form of body of revolution, that body of revolution can be sphere or cylinder; distances between ultrasonic emitters, ultraviolet irradiators and between ultrasonic emitters and ultraviolet radiators can be divisible by ultrasonic half-wave length; the unit of treated water discharge can be connected to the unit of water supply for treatment of a similar devise.<br>
List of Figures in the Drawings,<br>
The invention is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows schematically a vertical cross-section of water treatment device;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a view by A-A in figure 1;<br>
Fig. 3 shows an order of irradiators mounted inside the cylindrical housing of the device, with alternation of ultrasonic emitters and ultraviolet irradiators;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a block combined of two water treatment devices.<br>
Relative dimensions of some units and elements in the drawings have been changed to better illustrate.<br>
Information Confirming the Possibility of Implementation of the Invention<br>
Treated water (aquatic medium) containing organic, and/or inorganic, and/or toxic pollutants, and/or pathogenic microflora, is supplied (Fig. 1) into the cylindrical housing 1 of the water treatment device through the unit 2 of water supply where it is treated by simultaneous ultrasonic and ultraviolet irradiation in the unified acoustic field. Ultraviolet irradiators 3 are low-pressure mercury vapor lamps. To treat raw water with different degree and kind of pollution at provision of high rate of treatment (purification and disinfection) at the optimal correlation of the ultrasonic and ultraviolet irradiation per unit of treated volume of water ultrasonic emitters are made detachable to select that of desirable form and providing ultrasonic oscillations of desirable power and frequency. Impacts of ultrasonic irradiation form vapor-gaseous cavities and intensive pulsating vortexes within the whole volume of the device, that causes tearing of protein, fat, and carbohydrate chains, hurts microorganism membranes and brings microorganisms to destruction at a cell level where cavities collapse. A process of liquid volume degassing goes simultaneously. During this process upon the impact of the ultraviolet irradiation in microscopic bubbles of deluted in the water air active radicals and oxidants such as ozone appear that provide more intensive photochemical reactions, acceleration of oxidation of soluted organic pollutants and inactivation of pathogenic microflora. The proposed placement of ultrasonic emitters and ultraviolet irradiators in the volume of the cylindrical housing contributes to intensive intermixing of the treated water, which in turn contributes to<br><br>
increasing degree of purification and disinfection of the treated water. If only two ultrasonic irradiators are used, they should be preferably placed just next to the bases of the cylindrical housing in its axis thus to allow the ultrasonic field to occupy the entire volume of the cylindrical housing 1, including the unit 2 of water supply for treatment and the unit 5 of the treated water discharge. The ultrasonic emitters are made detachable in the form of bodies of revolution, for example as spheres or cylinders, at that distances between ultraviolet irradiators, ultrasonic emitters, ultraviolet irradiators and ultrasonic emitters have to be multiples of an ultrasonic half-wave length that allows powerful oxidants, which are formed in the process of simultaneous impacts to the treated water of ultraviolet irradiation, ultrasound and acoustic vibrations, to be distributed uniformly over the treated volume. The treated and disinfected water is supplied, for example to a consumer, through the unit 5 of treated water discharge.<br>
Another implementation of the device - with alternating locations of the ultraviolet irradiators and ultrasonic emitters - is shown in Fig. 3. Such location of the ultraviolet irradiators and ultrasonic emitters extends significantly functional capabilities of the water treatment installation, especially for the treatment of large volumes of water in one installation.<br>
The unit 5 of purified water discharge can be connected with a unit of water supply for treatment 2 of similar water treatment device (Fig 4). Such sequential connection of two devices increases essentially system reliability and increases much more its disinfections capability.<br>
Several doubled devices (i.e. each consisting of two sequentially connected ones) may be unified into parallel chains making treating complexes, stations and so on at that it is desired to have one chain as a reserve.<br>
The proposed device allows to carry out practically complete disinfection, i.e. to demolish entirely all forms of microorganisms (including spores), viruses and protozoa concentrated up to 106 units/liter and in amounts unachievable for conventional technologies because the powerful oxidants appearing in the process of simultaneous impacts to the treated water of ultraviolet irradiation, ultrasound and acoustic vibrations are uniformly distributed over the treated volume. The device is absolutely not exposed to biological encrustation and salts precipitation. Energy consumption for 1 mA/h of treated water doesn't exceed 5-8 wt for portable and 15-20 wt for wastewater.<br>
The proposed solution with groups of ultrasonic emitters (at least, two) and ultraviolet irradiators (not less than two) located all inside one housing was not disclosed in sources of information known to the inventors that allows to conclude that the proposed technical solution is in conformity with the "novelty" criterion.<br>
Best Method of Carrying Out the Invention.<br>
In Fig. 1 and in Fig.2 the preferable embodiment of the device for water treatment is shown, comprising the cylindrical housing 1 with unit of water supply for treatment 2, five ultraviolet irradiators 3 located inside said housing 1 in parallel with generatrix line of said cylindrical housing along one concentric circle, said ultraviolet irradiators 3 having protective covers made of material transparent for ultraviolet irradiation; said embodiment of the device comprising also four spherical ultrasonic emitters 4 that are placed on the longitudinal axis of said housing 1 and located equidistantly from each other at distances divisible by the half-wave length of the ultrasound generated by the<br><br><br>
ultrasonic emitter 4, at that two utmost ultrasonic emitters are placed just next to the bases of said cylindrical housing; said embodiment of the device having also the unit for treated water discharge 5. It is seen in Fig 2, that ultrasonic emitter 4 is placed in the axis of the cylindrical housing 1, while ultraviolet irradiators 3 are located in the concentric circle equidistantly from each other. Distances between ultraviolet irradiators 3 and between the ultraviolet irradiators 3 and ultrasonic emitters 4 are multiples of the ultrasound half-wave length of the ultrasonic irradiator 4.<br>
The table below gives the comparison of basic parameters of water before and after the treatment.<br>

So, the proposed technical solution allows to design multifunctional and universal device for disinfection and purification of aquatic medium of any composition with low specific metal quantity per structure required and low energy consumption.<br><br>
