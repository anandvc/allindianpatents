				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to polyamino acid comprising aspartic units and/or<br>
glutamic units and process for preparing the same and more particularly to<br>
novel materials based on biodegradable polyamino acids, which are useful<br>
especially for the vectorization of active principle(s) (AP).<br>
The invention is also directed toward novel pharmaceutical, cosmetic, dietetic<br>
or plant-protection compositions based on these polyamino acids. These<br>
compositions may be of the type allowing the vectorization of AP and<br>
preferably being in the form of emulsions, micelles, particles, gels, implants or<br>
films.<br>
The APs under consideration are advantageously biologically active compounds<br>
that may be administered to an animal or human body via the oral, parenteral,<br>
nasal, vaginal, ocular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal,<br>
intraperitoneal, intracerebral, buccal, etc. route.<br>
The APs more particularly concerned by the invention, but not limiting the<br>
invention thereto, are proteins, glycoproteins, peptides, polysaccharides,<br>
lipopolysaccharides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides and organic molecules.<br>
However, they may also be cosmetic products or plant-protection products, such<br>
as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc.<br>
In the field of vectorization of active principles, especially medicinal active<br>
principles, there is a need, in many cases:<br>
• to protect them against degradation (hydrolysis, precipitation on site,<br>
enzymatic digestion, etc.) until they reach their site of action,<br>
• and/or to control their rate of release so as to<br><br>
maintain a constant level over a given period,<br>
• and/or to convey them (while protecting them) to the<br>
site of action.<br>
To these ends, several types of polymers have been<br>
studied and some are even commercially available.<br>
Mention may be made, for example, of polymers of the<br>
polylactic, polylactic-glycolic, polyoxyethylene-<br>
oxypropylene, polyamino acid or polysaccharide type.<br>
These polymers constitute starting materials for<br>
manufacturing, for example, bulk implants, micro-<br>
particles, nanoparticles, vesicles, micelles or gels.<br>
Besides the fact that these polymers must be suitable<br>
for manufacturing such systems, they must also be<br>
biocompatible, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic and cost-<br>
effective, and they should be easy to eliminate from<br>
the body and/or biodegradable. As regards this last<br>
aspect, it is furthermore essential that the biodegra-<br>
dation in the body should generate nontoxic products.<br>
By way of illustration of the prior art concerning"<br>
polymers used as starting materials for making AP<br>
vectorization systems, various patents, patent applica-<br>
tions or scientific articles are mentioned below.<br>
Patent US 4 652 441 describes polylactide microcapsules<br>
encapsulating the hormone LH-RH. These microcapsules<br>
are produced by preparing a water-in-oil-in-water<br>
emulsion comprising an aqueous inner layer containing<br>
the hormone, a substance (gelatin) for fixing said<br>
hormone, a polylactide oily layer, and also an aqueous<br>
outer layer (polyvinyl alcohol). The AP is released<br>
over a period of more than 2 weeks after subcutaneous<br>
injection.<br>
Patent US 6 153 193 describes compositions based on<br>
amphiphilic poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxypropylene) mic-<br>
elles, for the vectorization of anticancer agents such<br><br>
as adriamycin.<br>
Akiyoshi et al. (J. Controlled Release 1998, 54,<br>
313-320) describe pullulans that have been made hydro-<br>
phobic by grafting cholesterol, and which form<br>
nanoparticles in water. These nanoparticles, which are<br>
capable of reversibly complexing with insulin, form<br>
stable colloidal suspensions.<br>
Patent US 4 351 337 describes amphiphilic copolyamino<br>
acids based on leucine and glutamate, which may be used<br>
in the form of implants or microparticles for the<br>
controlled release of active principles. Said active<br>
principles are released over a very long period that<br>
depends on the rate of degradation of the polymer.<br>
Patent US 4 888 398 describes polymers based on poly-<br>
glutamate or polyaspartate, and optionally polyleucine,<br>
with pendent groups of alkyloxycarbonylmethyl type,<br>
placed randomly on the polyamino acid chain. These<br>
polyamino acids, grafted with side groups, e.g.<br>
methoxycarbonylmethyl, may be used in the form of<br>
biodegradable implants containing a sustained-release<br>
AP.<br>
Patent US 5 904 936 describes nanoparticles obtained<br>
from a polyleucine-polyglutamate block polymer, which<br>
are capable of forming stable colloidal suspensions<br>
capable of spontaneously associating with biologically<br>
active proteins without denaturing them. Said proteins<br>
may then be released in vivo in a controlled manner,<br>
over a long period.<br>
Patent application WO 00/30618 describes nanoparticles<br>
obtained from a poly(sodium glutamate)(polymethyl,<br>
ethyl, hexadecyl or dodecyl glutamate) block polymer,<br>
which are capable of forming stable colloidal suspen-<br>
sions capable of spontaneously associating with<br><br>
biologically active proteins without denaturing them.<br>
Said proteins may then be released in vivo in a<br>
controlled manner, over a long period.<br>
These amphiphilic copolyamino acids are modified by the<br>
presence of a hydrophobic alkyl side chain.<br>
Patent US 5 449 513 describes amphiphilic block<br>
copolymers comprising a polyoxyethylene block and a<br>
polyamino acid block, for example poly (|3-benzyl-L-<br>
aspartate). These polyoxyethylene-polybenzylaspartate<br>
polymers form micelles that are capable of encapsulat-<br>
ing hydrophobic active molecules such as adriamycin or<br>
indomethacin.<br>
Patent application WO 99/61512 describes polylysines<br>
and polyornithines functionalized with a hydrophobic<br>
group (palmitic acid linked to polylysine or ornithine<br>
and a hydrophilic group (polyoxyethylene). These<br>
polymers, for example polylysine grafted with polyoxy-<br>
ethylene and palmitoyl chains, form, in the presence of<br>
cholesterol, vesicles capable of encapsulating doxo-<br>
rubicin or DNA.<br>
It is moreover known practice to employ vitamin E<br>
derivatives, and more specifically α-tocopherol, to<br>
construct AP vectorization systems.<br>
Natural vitamin E consists of a mixture of compounds<br>
known as tocopherols (see Burton and Ingold, Ace. Chem.<br>
Res. 1986, 19, 194-201) and, in this mixture, the<br>
α-tocopherol derivative is largely in majority amount.<br>
Vitamin E and some of its derivatives are nowadays used<br>
as a source of vitamin or as antioxidant in foods and<br>
cosmetic products. For these common uses, the vitamin E<br>
is found in its D-α-tocopherol form (its natural form)<br>
or in its D,L-α-tocopherol form (racemic and synthetic<br>
form). These two products are considered as being<br><br>
essentially nontoxic at doses considerably higher than<br>
therapeutic doses. The structure of α-tocopherol is as<br>
follows:<br><br>
The chiral positions are marked with an asterisk. The<br>
natural form has the configurations R,R,R and the<br>
synthetic form is a mixture in which the chiral carbons<br>
are independently R or S.<br>
As regards the vitamin E derivatives used in the field<br>
of vectorization of active principles, there is, at the<br>
present time and to the inventors' knowledge, no<br>
α-tocopherol-based polymer product, with the exception<br>
of polymers of polyoxyethylene type, one end of which<br>
is grafted with α-tocopherol-succinate groups.<br>
Polyethylene glycol grafted with a-tocopherol succinate<br>
at the end of the chain (PEGylated vitamin E) is<br>
moreover available on the market, sold under the name<br>
TPGS 1000 by the company Eastman Chemical Ltd) . This<br>
product, patented in 1954 (US 2 680 749), is nowadays<br>
used as a source of oral-route vitamin E. This polymer,<br>
and similarly a-tocopherol-succinate and unmodified<br>
a-tocopherol, have been proposed for the vectorization<br>
of active principles.<br>
Patent US 5 869 703 describes similar compounds in<br>
which the polyoxyethylene chain comprises a-tocopherol<br>
at one end and a (meth) acrylic residue at its other<br>
end. These α-tocopherol derivatives are used to prepare<br>
stable amphiphilic vesicles (liposomes), used directly<br>
in cosmetic applications.<br><br>
Patent application WO 00/71163 describes formulations<br>
based on polyethylene glycol grafted with α-tocopherol-<br>
succinate at the end of the chain (TPGS 1000) and on<br>
α-tocopherol, for the solubilization of paclitaxel<br>
(anticancer product). At the present time, the toxicity<br>
associated with the polyoxyethylene part is not known,<br>
and it is known that polyoxyethylene is not degraded in<br>
vivo. Furthermore, this compound contains only one<br>
α-tocopherol unit per polymer chain and it has<br>
properties in solution similar to those of surfactants.<br>
In any case, the use of this product for vectorization<br>
would lead to sparingly stable polymer-active principle<br>
combinations.<br>
Patent EP 0 243 446 describes the use of α-tocopherol<br>
(hemi)succinate (organic acid derivative of α-toco-<br>
pherol) for the manufacture of vesicles, in combination<br>
with an amine salt. These vesicles may be used for the<br>
encapsulation of various active principles including<br>
small molecules, peptides and proteins. In general, it<br>
is indicated in said patent that the organic acid may<br>
be an amino acid or a polyamino acid. However, no<br>
details are given in this respect. Only a-tocopherol<br>
(hemi)succinates are illustrated.<br>
Thus, even though there are a great many technical<br>
solutions in the prior art, developed and proposed for<br>
the vectorization of medicinal active principles,<br>
meeting all the requirements is difficult to achieve,<br>
and remains unsatisfactory.<br>
In this context, one of the essential objectives of the<br>
present invention is to provide a novel polymeric<br>
starting material, which may be used for AP<br>
vectorization and which can optimally satisfy all the<br>
specification details:<br>
O biocompatibility,<br>
O biodegradability,<br><br>
O ability to be converted easily and economically into<br>
active principle vectorization particles,<br>
O these particles themselves being capable:<br>
•	of forming stable aqueous colloidal suspensions,<br>
•	of readily associating with many active<br>
principles,<br>
•	and of releasing these active principles in vivo.<br>
This objective, among others, is achieved by the<br>
present invention, which relates firstly to amphiphilic<br>
polyamino acids comprising aspartic units and/or<br>
glutamic units, characterized in that at least some of<br>
these units bear grafts comprising at least one<br>
α-tocopherol unit.<br>
These novel polymers have a biodegradable skeleton<br>
based on polyamino acids bearing side chains comprising<br>
α-tocopherol. These polymers have association and/or<br>
encapsulation properties that are surprising in<br>
comparison with similar products and, what is more,<br>
they are readily degraded in the presence of enzymes.<br>
The Applicant has, to its merit, had the idea of<br>
combining, in an entirely judicious and advantageous<br>
manner, particular biodegradable polyAsp and/or polyGlu<br>
polyamino acids with grafts based on a-tocopherol<br>
(vitamin E), for the vectorization of AP.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, the term "polyamino<br>
acid" covers not only oligoamino acids comprising from<br>
2 to 20 amino acid units, but also polyamino acids<br>
comprising more than 20 amino acid units.<br>
Preferably, the polyamino acids according to the<br>
present invention are oligomers or homopolymers<br>
comprising glutamic or aspartic amino acid repeating<br>
units or copolymers comprising a mixture of these two<br>
types of amino acid units, said units being partially<br><br>
substituted with grafts comprising a-tocopherol. The<br>
units under consideration in these polymers are amino<br>
acids having the D, L or D, L configuration and are<br>
linked via their α- or Y-positions for the glutamate or<br>
glutamic unit and the a- or p-position for the aspartic<br>
or aspartate unit.<br>
The preferred amino acid units are those having the L<br>
configuration and a bond of a type.<br>
Even more preferably, the polyamino acids according to<br>
the invention correspond to the general formula (I)<br>
below:<br><br>
in which:<br>
•R1 represents . H, a C2 to C10 linear or C3 to C10<br>
branched alkyl, benzyl or a terminal amino acid unit;<br>
•	R2 represents H, a linear C2 to C10 or branched C3 to<br>
C10 acyl group, or a pyroglutamate;<br>
•	R3 is H or a cationic species preferably selected<br>
from the group comprising:<br><br>
-	metallic cations advantageously chosen from the<br>
subgroup comprising sodium, potassium, calcium and<br>
magnesium,<br>
-	organic cations advantageously chosen from the<br>
subgroup comprising:<br><br>
•	amine-based cations,<br>
•	oligoamine-based cations,<br>
•	cations based on polyamine (polyethyleneimine<br><br>
being particularly preferred),<br>
• cations based on amino acid(s) advantageously<br>
chosen from the class comprising cations based<br>
on lysine or arginine,<br>
- or cationic polyamino acids advantageously chosen<br>
from the subgroup comprising polylysine or oligo-<br>
lysine;<br>
•	R4 represents a direct bond or a "spacer" based on<br>
1 to 4 amino acid units;<br>
•	A independently represents a -CH2- (aspartic unit) or<br>
-CH2-CH2- (glutamic unit) radical;<br>
•	n/(n+m) is defined as the molar degree of grafting<br>
and ranges from 0.5 to 100 mol%;<br>
•	n+m ranges from 3 to 1000 and preferably between 30<br>
and 300;<br>
•	T represents an a-tocopherol unit.<br>
For these common uses, vitamin E is found in its D-α-<br>
tocopherol form (its natural form) or in its D,L-α-<br>
tocopherol form (racemic and synthetic form). These two<br>
products are considered as being essentially nontoxic<br>
at doses considerably higher than therapeutic doses. In<br>
the context of the invention, these two forms of<br>
α-tocopherol are preferred.<br>
The α-tocopherol is of natural or synthetic origin.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the<br>
polyamino acids are α-L-glutamate or α-L-glutamic<br>
homopolymers.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, the<br>
polyamino acids are α-L-aspartate or α-L-aspartic<br>
homopolymers.<br>
According to a third embodiment of the invention, the<br>
polyamino acids are α-L-aspartate/α-L-glutamate or α-L-<br>
aspartic/α-L-glutamic copolymers.<br><br>
Advantageously, the distribution of the aspartic and/or<br>
glutamic units bearing grafts comprising at least one<br>
α-tocopherol unit is such that the polymers thus<br>
composed are either random, of block type or of multi-<br>
block type.<br>
According to another mode of definition, the polyamino<br>
acids according to the invention have a molar mass of<br>
between 2000 and 100 000 g/mol and preferably between<br>
5000 and 40 000 g/mol.<br>
It is moreover preferable for the molar degree of<br>
grafting with a-tocopherol of the polyamino acids<br>
according to the invention to be between 3% and 70% and<br>
preferably between 5% and 50%.<br>
The polyamino acids of the invention are, remarkably,<br>
capable of being used in several ways depending on the<br>
degree of grafting. The methods for forming a polymer<br>
for the encapsulation of an active principle in the<br>
various forms targeted by the invention are known to<br>
those skilled in the art. For further details,<br>
reference may be made, for example, to these few<br>
particularly pertinent references:<br>

0-8247-0369-3.<br>
The polyamino acids are also extremely advantageous as<br><br>
a result of the fact that, at a relatively low degree<br>
of grafting of about from 3% to 10%, they form in water<br>
at pH 7.4 (for example with a phosphate buffer)<br>
colloidal suspensions or gels depending on the polymer<br>
concentration. Furthermore, the polyamino acid<br>
particles forming the dispersed phase of the colloidal<br>
suspension can readily associate with active principles<br>
such as proteins, peptides or small molecules. The<br>
preferred forming operation is that described in patent<br>
application WO 00/30618 by the Applicant, which<br>
consists in dispersing the polymer in water and<br>
incubating the solution in the presence of an AP. This<br>
solution can then be filtered through a 0.2 µm filter<br>
and then injected directly into a patient.<br>
Above a degree of grafting of 10%, the polymer can form<br>
microparticles capable of associating or of encapsulat-<br>
ing APs. In this context, the forming of the micro-<br>
particles may take place by codissolving the AP and the<br>
polymer in a suitable organic solvent, and the mixture<br>
is then precipitated from water. The particles are then<br>
recovered by filtration and can then be used for an<br>
oral administration (in the form of a gel capsule, in<br>
compacted and/or coated form, or alternatively in a<br>
form dispersed in an oil) or parenterally after redis-<br>
persing in water.<br>
At degrees of grafting of greater than 30%, the redis-<br>
persion of the polymer in aqueous phase becomes more<br>
difficult due to the smaller amount of ionizable<br>
carboxylate functions, and the polymer precipitates. In<br>
this case, the polymer can be dissolved in a biocompat-<br>
ible solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone or a suitable<br>
oil such as Miglyol®, and then injected intramuscularly<br>
or subcutaneously or into a tumor. The diffusion of the<br>
solvent or of the oil results in precipitation of the<br>
polymer at the site of injection and thus forms a<br>
deposit. These deposits then provide controlled release<br><br>
by diffusion and/or erosion and/or hydrolytic or enzym-<br>
atic degradation of the polymer.<br>
In general, the polymers of the invention, in neutral<br>
or ionized form, may be used alone or in a liquid,<br>
solid or gel composition and in an aqueous or organic<br>
medium.<br>
It should be understood that the polymer based on<br>
polyamino acids contains carboxylic functions that are<br>
either neutral (COOH form) or ionized, depending on the<br>
pH and composition. For this reason, the solubility in<br>
an aqueous phase depends directly on the content of<br>
free COOH (not grafted with vitamin E) and on the pH.<br>
In aqueous solution, the counter-cation may be a<br>
metallic cation such as sodium, calcium or magnesium,<br>
or an organic cation such as triethanolamine,<br>
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or a polyamine such as<br>
polyethyleneimine.<br>
The polymers of the invention are obtained via methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art. The polyamino acids<br>
may be obtained in at least two ways:<br>
•	grafting of α-tocopherol onto a polyamino acid, or<br>
•	polymerization of NCA derivatives of α-tocopherol,<br>
followed by a selective hydrolysis.<br>
In the first case, a polyamino acid, homopolyglutamate,<br>
homopolyaspartate or a glutamate/aspartate copolymer,<br>
in block, multiblock or random form, is prepared, for<br>
example, according to standard methods.<br>
To obtain polyamino acids of a type, the technique most<br>
commonly used is based on the polymerization of<br>
N-carboxyamino acid anhydrides (NCA), described, for<br>
example, in the article "Biopolymers, 1976, 15, 1869"<br>
and in the book by H.R. Kricheldorf "alpha-Aminoacid-N-<br>
carboxy Anhydride and related Heterocycles", Springer<br><br>
Verlag (1987). The NCA derivatives are preferably NCA-<br>
O-Me, NCA-O-Et or NCA-O-Bz derivatives (Me = methyl,<br>
Et = ethyl and Bz = benzyl). The polymers are then<br>
hydrolyzed under suitable conditions to give the<br>
polymer in its acid form. These methods are inspired<br>
from the description given in patent FR 2 801 226 from<br>
the Applicant. A certain number of polymers that may be<br>
used according to the invention, for example, of poly-<br>
(α-L-aspartic), poly(α-L-glutamic), poly(α-D-glutamic)<br>
and poly(y-L-glutamic) type of variable masses are<br>
commercially available. The polyaspartic of α-β type is<br>
obtained by condensing aspartic acid (to obtain a poly-<br>
succinimide), followed by a basic hydrolysis (see<br>
Tomida et al. Polymer 1997, 38, 4733-36).<br>
The coupling of α-tocopherol with an acid function is<br>
readily performed by reacting -che polyamino acid with<br>
vitamin E in the presence of a carbodiimide as coupling<br>
agent and, preferably, a catalyst such as 4-dimethyl-<br>
aminopyridine, and in a suitable solvent such as<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) or<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The carbodiimide is, for<br>
example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diisopropylcarbo-<br>
diimide. The degree of grafting is controlled<br>
chemically via the stoichiometry of the constituents<br>
and reagents, or the reaction time.<br>
In the second case, an NCA derivative of a-tocopherol<br>
having the structure below is synthesized. The<br>
synthesis is analogous to that described for stearyl<br>
glutamate N-carboxyanhydride by Poche et al. Macro-<br>
molecules 1995, 28, 6745-53.<br><br><br>
The NCA derivative of a-tocopherol-glutamate is then<br>
copolymerized with, for example, benzylglutamate NCA<br>
and, to obtain the glutamate or glutamic functions, a<br>
selective hydrolysis reaction of the benzyl functions<br>
is performed in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and<br>
hydrobromic acid at room temperature. It should be<br>
noted that this second synthetic route makes it<br>
possible easily to prepare random, block or multiblock<br>
copolymers simply by modifying the order of addition of<br>
the monomers.<br>
The coupling of vitamin E via a spacer consisting of<br>
1 to 4 amino acids may be performed via successive<br>
reactions of vitamin E with suitably protected amino<br>
acids, which are then deprotected to have a graftable<br>
amine function on the polymer, or by reaction with an<br>
oligopeptide. For example, the synthesis of an α-toco-<br>
pherol with a leucine unit is performed according to a<br>
general method well known to those skilled in the art<br>
and according to the following scheme:<br><br>
It should be noted that the direct grafting of α-toco-<br>
pherol onto the polymer takes place via an ester<br>
function, whereas in the case of the presence of a<br>
spacer based on amino acid(s), it takes place via an<br>
amide function. As for the preparation of an ester<br>
bond, the amide bond may be formed in the same manner<br>
using a standard coupling agent such as a dialkylcarbo-<br><br>
diimide.<br>
According to one variant of the invention, the poly-<br>
amino acids with which it is concerned not only bear<br>
α-tocopherol grafts but also, per molecule, at least<br>
one graft of polyalkylene glycol type linked to a<br>
glutamate and/or aspartate unit, and preferably of<br>
formula (II) below:<br><br>
in which<br>
R'4 represents a direct bond or a "spacer" based on<br>
1 to 4 amino acid units;<br>
X is a hetero atom chosen from the group comprising<br>
oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur;<br>
R5 and R6 independently represent H or a linear Cl to<br>
C4 alkyl.<br>
n ranges from 3 to 1000.<br>

glycol.<br>
According to another preferred characteristic of the<br>
invention, the molar percentage of grafting of the<br>
polyalkylene glycol ranges from 1% to 30%.<br>
The grafting of these pendent side groups (II) is<br>
performed in a manner that is known per se and<br>
according to techniques within the capability of a<br>
person skilled in the art, for example by forming<br>
amide, ester or thioester bonds with the carboxyls of<br>
glutamate and/or aspartate monomers. These techniques<br>
may especially be those used for the grafting of<br>
a-tocopherol onto a polyamino acid skeleton, said<br><br>
techniques being described in the present patent<br>

Exanple 1: Polymar P1<br>
Synthesis of a polyglutamate grafted with α-tocopherol<br>
of synthetic origin<br>
The α-L-polyglutamate polymer, with a mass equivalent<br>
to about 10 000 relative to a polyoxyethylene standard,<br>
is obtained by polymerization of NCAGluOMe, followed by<br>
a hydrolysis, as described in patent application<br>
FR 2 801 226. 5.5 g of this α-L-polyglutamate polymer<br>
are dissolved in 92 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF), by<br>
heating at 40°C for 2 hours. Once the polymer has<br>
dissolved, the temperature is allowed to return to 25°C<br>
and 1.49 g of D,L,cx~tocopherol (&gt; 98%, obtained from<br>
Fluka®) predissolved in 6 ml of. DMF, 0.09 g of<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine predissolved in 6 ml of DMF and<br>
0.57 g of diisopropylcarbodiimide predissolved in 6 ml<br>
of DMF are successively added. After stirring for<br>
8 hours at 25°C, the reaction medium is poured into<br>
800 ml of water containing 15% sodium chloride and<br>
hydrochloric acid (pH 2) . The precipitated polymer is<br><br>
then recovered by filtration, washed with 0.1N<br>
hydrochloric acid and then washed with water. The<br>
polymer is then redissolved in 75 ml of DMF and then<br>
reprecipitated from water containing, as previously,<br>
salt and acid at pH 2. After washing twice with water,<br>
the polymer is washed several times with diisopropyl<br>
ether. The polymer is then oven-dried under vacuum at<br>
40°C. A yield of about 85% is obtained.<br>
The degree of grafting estimated by proton NMR is about<br>
7.8% and an HPLC analysis reveals a residual tocopherol<br>
content of less than 0.3%.<br>
Mw (measured by GPC, eluting with NMP) = 17 500 g/mol<br>
(as polymethyl methacrylate equivalent).<br>
Examples 2, 3, 4 and 5: Synthesis of polymers P2, P3,<br>
P4 and P5<br>
Polymers containing variable amounts of tocopherol are<br>
prepared in the same manner.<br>
Table 1:<br><br>
Polymer	α-Tocopherol	Degree of grafting<br>
P2	Synthetic: D,L	5.2%<br>
P3	Synthetic: D,L	12.8%<br>
P4	Synthetic D,L	20.0%<br>
P5	Synthetic D,L	50.0%<br>
In all cases, the amount of tocopherol effectively<br>
grafted was confirmed by NMR.<br>
Example 6: Polymer P6<br>
Synthesis of a polyglutamate grafted with α-tocopherol<br>
of natural origin<br>
In a similar manner, the polymer P6 is synthesized with<br>
7.3% of D-alpha-tocopherol of natural origin (at a<br>
purity of 98.5%, obtained from the company ADM France).<br><br>
The molar mass is 17 400 (GPC NMP, PMMA eq).<br>
Example 7: Analysis of the polymers in aqueous solution<br>
The polymers are dissolved in a phosphate-buffered<br>
saline at pH 7.4 at concentrations ranging from 10 to<br>
40 mg/ml, and the pH is adjusted to 7.4 by adding 0.1N<br>
sodium hydroxide. The dissolution is observed visually.<br>
Table 2: Solubility in saline water at pH 7.4<br><br>
Phosphate buffer: 0.01M phosphate, 0.0027M KC1 and<br>
0.137M NaCl.<br>
An observation by electron transmission of the clear<br>
solutions of the polymer P1 deposited on a support<br>
shows the existence of nanoparticles of 15 to 25 nm. A<br>
comparative analysis of the solutions of polymer P1, P6<br>
and α-tocopherol succinate at 15 mg/ml in water at pH<br>
7.4 (phosphate buffer) reveals that only the a-toco-<br>
pherol succinate develops a milky solution characteris-<br>
tic of vesicles, as described in patent EP 0 243 446.<br>
Example 8: Adsorption of a dye onto the polymer P1<br>
According to one of the subjects of the invention, the<br>
polymers may be used in the form of a colloidal<br>
suspension in water and associated with an active<br>
principle. For this application, it is demonstrated in<br>
the experiment below that with certain polymers,<br>
especially those with a degree of grafting of about<br>
from 5% to 10% tocopherol, the adsorption capacity is<br>
greater than that of a similar compound of the prior<br>
art.<br><br>
For this study, the polymer P1 was compared with a<br>
similar polymer containing a dodecanol chain grafted<br>
onto a polyglutamate. This polymer is described in<br>
patent WO 00/30618.<br>
The study is performed in the following manner: the<br>
polymers are dissolved in an aqueous solution at pH 7<br>
(phosphate buffer) and 5 mg of the dye known as Orange<br>
OT (Rn CAS: 2646-17-5) are added. The solutions are<br>
left in an ultrasonic bath for 1 hour to achieve the<br>
association. The solutions are then centrifuged to<br>
remove the nonassociated dye, and the optical density<br>
is measured at the Amax of the dye, which is at 495 nm.<br><br>
It is found that at a molar degree of grafting of less<br>
than a half and at a slightly smaller mass concentra-<br>
tion of polymer, the polymer P1 has a much higher<br>
capacity for association of the dye Orange OT.<br>
Example 9: Synthesis of the polymer P7<br>
Synthesis of a polyglutamate containing an α-tocopherol<br>
leucine graft<br>
The a-tocopherol leucine derivative is first<br>
synthesized, in the following manner.<br><br>
D,L-α-Tocopherol (4.3 g) is reacted with BOC-leucine<br>
(2.3 g) in 15 ml of dichloromethane in the presence of<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine (244 mg) and diisopropylcarbo-<br>
diimide (1.5 g) . After 2 hours at 30°C the product is<br>
purified by filtration on a column of silica. 5 g of<br>
the product α-tocopherol leucine BOC are obtained (77%<br>
yield). Its structure is confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The deprotection of the product is performed in<br>
trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature of between 5 and<br>
10°C for 1 hour. After purification by filtration<br>
through silica, 3.3 g of the desired product are<br>
isolated (78% yield). Its structure is confirmed by NMR<br>
spectroscopy.<br>
The grafting reaction on a polyglutamic acid is then<br>
performed under the same conditions as in example 1,<br>
with a degree of grafting of 7%. The structure of the<br>
polymer and the degree of grafting were confirmed by<br>
NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Example 10: Synthesis of polymer P8<br>
Synthesis of a polyglutamate containing an α-tocopherol<br>
graft and a polyoxyethylene glycol graft.<br>
A grafting reaction is performed as in example 1, with<br>
11 mol% of a-tocopherol and 2 mol% of an amino<br>
methoxypolyethylene glycol of formula<br>
MeO(CH2CH2O)aCH2CH2NH2 and of molar mass 3000 (product<br>
obtained from the company Shearwaters). The polymer in<br>
its acid form is obtained in a yield of 72%. Proton NMR<br>
confirms a degree of grafting with a-tocopherol of<br>
10.9% and with polyethylene glycol of 1.9%.<br>
Example 11: Adsorption of insulin<br>
A solution containing 1 mg of polymer P1 and 7 mg of<br>
insulin at pH 7.0 in 1 ml of water is prepared and is<br>
left to incubate for 2 hours. The suspension is then<br>
ultrafiltered (10 OOOxG, 20 minutes with a 100 KDa<br><br>
threshold). The free insulin in the filtrate is assayed<br>
by HPLC and the amount of associated insulin is deduced<br>
by difference. A degree of association of greater than<br>
95% relative to the insulin employed is measured. Under<br>
the same conditions, the comparative polymer of example<br>
8 allows 40% association. The adsorption capacity of<br>
polymer P1 is thus greater.<br>
Example 12: in-vitro degradation of polymer P1 in the<br>
presence of enzymes<br>
Polymer P1 is dissolved at pH 7.5 (phosphate buffer and<br>
10 mM of calcium cation) and at a concentration of<br>
20 mg/ml. 0.1 ml of protease (solution of 10 mg/ml) is<br>
added and the degradation is monitored by aqueous GPC.<br>
A relatively rapid degradation is found, with a half-<br>
life time of the initial polymer of about 100 minutes.<br><br>
