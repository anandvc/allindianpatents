The invention relates to a process for producing an optically active amino alcohol compound of formula [3]<br><br>
wherein the substituents are as herein after defined.<br>
The above-mentioned compound useful as an HIV protease inhibitor has been known from WO95/09843, and the production methods thereof have been known from W097/11937 and W097/11938.<br>
However, these production methods cannot impart stereoselectivity to intermediates, and thus, they are not satisfactory in view of low yields of the objective intermediates. In addition, these methods require heating to 80-90°C during reaction, as well as purification due to crystallization, since the resulting intermediate compound is a 1:1 mixture of isomers.<br>
The present invention aims at solving the above-mentioned problems, and producing an optically active amino alcohol compound, an enantiomer thereof and a salt thereof stereo selectively at high yields as a highly pure salt.<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in an attempt to solve the above-mentioned problems, and found that a ring opening of a mesoepoxide compound, using chiral or choral amine and a mixed catalyst of a proton donor and a Lewis acid under mild temperature conditions leads to stereoselective production of an optically active amino alcohol compound, an enantiomer thereof and a salt thereof at high yields. In addition, they have found<br><br>
that the use of a chiral proton donor enables production of an amino alcohol at sufficient asymmetric yields by ring opening of an epoxy compound using achiral amine.   They have also found that an important intermediate compound [5] and an enantiomer thereof to be mentioned later can be produced stereo selectively and highly efficiently in large amounts as crystalline salts having high purity by isomer zing the 7-membered moiety of said amino alcohol to a 5-membered structure and then removing the substituents(s) R4 and/or R5 on the nitrogen atom, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.<br>
