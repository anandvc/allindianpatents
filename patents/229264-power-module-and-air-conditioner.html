Power Module And Air Conditioner Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a power module and an air conditioner comprising a power module. More particularly, the present invention relates to a heat dissipating structure for improving the heat dissipating efficiency of a power module on which circuit components that generate a gre'at deal of heat are mounted, and the modulization of a power module that uses an inverter circuit to convert commercial ac power to ac power having a predetermined frequency. Background Art<br>
In order to control a device at a predetermined frequency, an inverter circuit will be used to rectify commercial ac power to dc power, and then convert the dc power to ac power that is controlled at a predetermined frequency.<br>
The inverter circuit is formed by combining a rectifying stack, a smoothing condenser, a power transistor, and the like. These circuit components continue to be integrated, and an intelligent module which packages a drive circuit and a power element together is now being marketed, hi addition, one type of electric power unit needed to drive the inverter includes a converter that rectifies commercial ac power to dc power, and improves harmonic suppression and efficiency. Moreover, it has been proposed that this electric power unit employs a power switch and the like.<br>
The converter that converts commercial ac power to dc power, and the inverter that converts dc power to ac power of a predetermined frequency, are comprised of heat generating components such as diodes and power switches, and thus must include a heat dissipating structure. For example, it is possible to achieve a cooling effect on the electrical components by using an aluminum substrate to mount the electrical components, due to the cooling effect provided by the surface of the aluminum substrate that is opposite the<br><br>
mounting surface.<br>
However, because the integration of these electrical components continue, a great deal of heat will be generated thereby and the heat dissipating capabilities of the aluminum substrate will be insufficient. Because of this, it is thought that the heat dissipating capabilities will improve by fixing a large number of plate shaped heat dissipating fins onto the bottom surface of the aluminum substrate.<br>
When the heat dissipating plates are added, efficient heat transfer cannot be expected at the connecting surface between the aluminum substrate and the heat dissipating fins because the portion that connects these two elements has a great deal of heat resistance. In order to address this problem, increasing the size of the heat dissipating fins to increase the heat dissipating capacity thereof has been considered. However, this will increase the overall size of the device and make it difficult to lower costs.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a power module that has an efficient heat dissipation structure, that is small, and that allows cost to be lowered.<br>
In addition, because there are many instances in which the converter and inverter are placed in barracks or in specialized modules, the shape of the completed component is large, the thermal design thereof must take into consideration its spatial layout design and thermal state, and the design of the converter and inverter will be extremely difficult.<br>
In addition, a controller for controlling the inverter circuit is comprised of a microcomputer, and the controller and the inverter circuit are connected by a harness or the like. When a drive signal is transmitted via this harness, there is a concern that noise will be easily transferred and be involved in malfiinctions.<br>
Furthermore, there are other problems that it is difficult to diagnose a failure part, it is difficult to specify the components to exchange and it is complicate to exchange a component, since the control of the inverter is high efficient.<br>
Because there is a great deal of exposed solder, component lead, and the like for<br><br>
mounting each component, there is also a concern that tracking accidents will occur due to the infiltration of corrosion, dust, or small animals therein.<br>
Operational control of an air conditioner is conducted by controlling the amount of refrigerant that circulates in the refrigerant circuit with the compressor. This type of compressor uses an inverter circuit to control the operational frequency thereof, and thus includes the problems with the inverter circuit described above. In particular, it is desirable for the air conditioner to be made compact by reducing the size of each component therein, and to simplify the layout and thermal design thereof Furthermore, there is a need to prevent malfunctions due to the effects of noise, as well as a need to prevent the ill effects of corrosion, dust, and the infiltration of small animals therein. In particular, when the inverter circuit is installed in the outdoor unit of an air conditioner, there are concems about the deterioration thereof that accompanies environmental changes such as temperature variations over a long period of time and wind and rain, and the infiltration of insects and other small animals.    The effects of these problems need to be eliminated to the greatest degree possible.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a power module that is constructed such that the portions thereof that are exposed, such as the hamess, the solder, and component leads, are reduced to the greatest degree possible, the effects of noise are eliminated, the effects of corrosion, dust, and the infiltration of small animals are eliminated, and special layout and thermal designs are not necessary.

(Structure of the modulized electric power circuit)<br>
The details of a power module according to the present invention will be described with reference to the figures.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing an example of an electric power circuit that is<br><br>
employed in an air conditioner.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the electric power circuit is connected to a commercial ac power source 1, and the ac power is supplied to a control power unit 2 and a modulized electric power circuit 3.<br>
The control power unit 2 is made up of a switching power supply, and supplies electrical power to a RA controller 4 that includes a microprocessor, ROM, and various types of interfaces. Detection signals from a plurality of sensors 5 are input into the RA controller 4. These sensors 5 include an outside air thermistor that detects the temperature of the outside air, a heat exchange thermistor that detects the evaporation temperature and the condensing temperature of a heat exchanger, a discharge line temperature sensor that detects the discharge line temperature of a compressor, and an intake pressure sensor that detects the intake pressure of a compressor. In addition, a plurality of actuators 6 are connected to and controlled by the RA controller 4, and include an electric expansion valve that is disposed in the refrigerant circuit and serves to reduce the pressure of the refrigerant therein, and a four way directional control valve which serves to switch the operational mode of the refrigerant circuit.<br>
The electric power circuit 3 primarily serves to control the electrical power that drives a compressor 7 and a fan motor 8 in response to the operational state of the air conditioner, and is comprised of a converter 31 that rectifies the ac power supplied from the ac power source 1 and converts it to dc power, an inverter 32 that converts the output of the converter 31 to ac power, a converter driver 33 which serves to drive the converter 31, an inverter driver 34 which serves to drive the inverter 32, a fan motor controller 37 that generates a power supply for driving the fan motor 8, a controller 35 that controls the converter driver 33, the inverter driver 34, and the fan motor controller 37, and a communication circuit 36 which transmits and receives data between the RA controller 4 and the electric power circuit 3.<br><br>
The converter 31 can be configured as a power switch, and can be configured to include an active filter circuit that outputs dc power at a fixed voltage with respect to the inverter 32.<br>
The fan motor 8 can use an inverter circuit and an inverter driver disposed therein. In this situation, the fan motor 8 is configured such that the output of the converter 31 is supplied thereto, and rotational control thereof occurs based on rotational speed command signals that are input fi^om the fan motor controller 37.<br>
As noted above, the fan motor controller 37 is configured such that it outputs the rotational speed command signals for the fan motor 8. In situations in which the fan motor 8 does not use an inverter circuit disposed therein, it can be configured like the controller for the compressor 7 to include an inverter, and inverter driver, and the like.<br>
The RA controller 4 determines the control variables for each unit in response to the detected values input fi-om the sensors 5 and the current operational mode, outputs control values to the actuators 6, and transmits control.variables for the compressor 7 and the fan motor 8 to the controller 35 inside the electrical power circuit 3 via the communication circuit 36.<br>
The controller 35 outputs control values to the converter driver 33, the inverter driver 34, and the fan motor controller 37 based upon the control variables for the compressor 7 and the fan motor 8 transmitted fi-om the RA controller 4. Thus, the operational fi-equency of the compressor 7 and the rotational fi"equency of the fan motor 8 can be controlled in response to the operational state of the air conditioner.<br>
By integrating and modulizing the circuit components, and packaging the heat generating and noise generating components, the controllability of the electric power circuit 3 can be improved, and high performance control thereof can be performed. In other words, as shown in Fig. 2, the electric power circuit 3 is comprised of a plurality of bare chip components 311,312, and 313 such as a diode and power transistor, smoothing condenser, IC<br><br>
chip, and the hke that are each mounted on an aluminum substrate 301 by means of wire bonding, solder, and the like.<br>
The aluminum substrate 301 can, for example, be comprised of a sheet of aluminum nitride having high thermal conductivity and excellent electrical resistance, and a thin sheet of copper that forms a circuit pattern that is adhered to the surface thereof If a harness is used to connect the controller 35, converter 31, inverter 32, converter driver 33, inverter driver 34, fan motor controller 37 and the communication circuit 36, the harness will be a bundle of connections and will generate emission noise in the same way a coil does. By using an aluminum substrate 301 that is comprised of a thin copper sheet that forms a circuit pattern and an aluminum nitride sheet that has the thin copper sheet applied to the surface thereof, the generation of emission noise can be suppressed, and an increase in controllability due to a reduction in noise can be provided.<br>
Circuit components that have a high heat output are mounted directly to the aluminum substrate 301, such as the bare chip components 311 and 312. In addition, the bare chip component 313, such as the controller 35 comprised of a one chip microcomputer that includes a microprocessor, ROM, various interfaces, and the like, is to be separated from the temperature load and noise generated by other circuit components and can be mounted on top of a standard printed wiring board 321. A lead 322 provided on the printed wiring board 322 can be mounted on the aluminum substrate 301 by soldering. As shown in Fig. 2, the printed wiring board 321 can be disposed at a right angle to the mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301, and as shown in Fig. 3, the printed wiring board 321 can also be disposed parallel to the mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301.<br>
Thus, by mounting precision components such as microcomputers and the like to the printed wiring board 321 in a hybrid manner, unnecessary temperature loads from other circuit components that have high heat outputs can be eliminated, and the effects on noise due to the power switch and the like can be reduced.<br><br>
The interior of the electric power circuit 3 is a non-insulated structure, and is configured such that the controller 35.transmits data to and receives data from the exterior thereof via the communication circuit 36. Thus, the packaging density of each circuit component can be increased and a reduction in the size of the module can be provided, because the communication circuit 36 insulates the electric power circuit 3 from the exterior thereof and the insulating distance of the module interior is shortened.<br>
As noted above, a molding material that molds both the bare chip components 311, 312 and the bare chip component 313 installed on the mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301 is provided on top of the aluminum substrate 301.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, if the printed wiring board 321 is installed on the mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301 such that it is perpendicular thereto, the molding material can be arranged such that it covers the bare chip components 311, 312 and the lead 322 of the printed wiring board 321 directly installed thereon. In addition, the molding material can also be structured such that one molding material covers bare chip components 311,312 having equal thicknesses, and another molding material covers only the area around the printed wiring board 321. In this situation, it is preferable that the molding material that covers only the area around the printed circuit board 321 be more adhesive than the molding material that covers the bare chip components 311, 312.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, if the printed wiring board 321 is disposed parallel with respect to the mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301, a molding material can be provided that covers all of the circuit components. Moreover, a molding material can be provided that covers only the bare chip components 311, 312 and the lead 322 provided on the printed wiring board 321. Furthermore, the molding material can also be structured such that one molding material covers bare chip components 311, 312 having equal thicknesses, and another molding material covers only the area around the printed wiring board 321. In this situation also, it is preferable that the molding material that covers only the area around<br><br>
the printed circuit board 321 be more adhesive than the molding material that covers the bare chip components 311,312.<br>
The molding material is comprised of an insulating synthetic resin. For example, a silicone or epoxy resin can be employed.<br>
The molding material can be applied such that it covers each circuit component mounted on the aluminum substrate 301. However, in order to achieve improved insulation capabilities, a case can be formed on the upper surface of the aluminum substrate 301, and the molding material can be disposed inside the case. An example of this configuration is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, side walls 351, 352, 353, 354 are formed on the edges of the aluminum substrate 301 and extend toward the mounting surface side thereof Side walls 351-354 can be formed from aluminum nitride, like the aluminum substrate 301, or can be formed fi"om an insulating synthetic resin. In addition, the side walls 351-354 are fixed to the respective edges of the aluminum substrate 301 by thermally melting them thereto, adhering them thereto, or the like, and the portions of the side walls 351-354 that are adjacent thereto are fixed to each other by means of thermal melting, adhesives, or the like so that there are no gaps therebetween. Note that it is also possible to unitarily mold the side walls 351-354 such that they are integral with each other.<br>
As noted above, the molding material 341 is disposed in the empty space on the mounting surface side of the aluminum substrate 301 that is formed by the aluminum substrate 301 and the side walls 351-354. The molding material 341 is arranged such that it covers the bare chip components 311, 312, etc. that are mounted on the aluminum substrate 301 as well as their wiring portions.<br>
This configuration prevents the infiltration of corrosion, dust, and small animals therein, and also prevents accidents such as cut wires and short-circuiting. In addition, a fi'ame structure that surrounds the aluminum substrate 301 can be formed with side walls<br><br>
351-354 that are integrally formed or in which each side is combined with the others, and a case can be formed for mold filling by fixing the side walls 351-354 to the aluminum substrate such that there are no gaps therebetween. Thus, all surfaces of the bare chip components 311,312, etc. and their wiring portions can be easily covered, and reHability will be improved thereby. Furthermore, a case structure can be achieved by means of the side walls 351-354 and the aluminum substrate 301, and the thickness of the molding can be fi*eely adjusted so that it covers each circuit component to a necessary and sufficient degree. In other words, by using the side walls 351-354 that surround the periphery of the aluminum substrate 301 to prevent the molding material fi"orn flowing out, the thickness of the molding material can be freely adjusted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, side walls 361-364 that are comprised of a synthetic resin in which a conductive pattern formed of copper has been embedded therein can be substituted for the side walls 351-354 shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The side walls 361-364 are formed by inserting a conductive pattern made of copper sheet into a metal mold, and then integrally molding the side walls 361-364 by using a insulating synthetic resin. The side walls 361-364 can also be molded individually, or can be molded so that they are all integral with each other. The side walls 361-364 that are formed in this manner are fixed to the aluminum substrate 301 by means of thermal melting, adhesives, screws, or the like. Preferably, the case is structured such that there are no gaps between the aluminum substrate 301 and the side walls 361-364, and between the portions of the side walls 361-364 that are adjacent to each other.<br>
The molding material 341 is placed into the space on the mounting surface side of the aluminum substrate 301 that is formed by the aluminum substrate 301 and the side walls 361-364. The molding material 341 is disposed such that it covers the bare chip components 311, 312, etc. that are mounted on the aluminum substrate 301 and their wiring portions.<br><br>
The conductive pattern embedded in the interior of the side walls 361-364 forms a wiring pattern for installing large external circuit components 371-373 such as electrolytic capacitors. Thus, these external circuit components 371-373 can be installed at the proper positions on the side walls 361-364 with solder or the like. Fig. 5 shows an example in which the external circuit components 371-373 are installed on the outer surface of the side wall 361. However, if there is open space above the molding material 341, it is also possible to install the external circuit components on the interior surfaces of the side walls 361-364.<br>
This arrangement makes three dimensional mounting of components possible by mounting the circuit components on the side surfaces of the case of the module, and can increase the integration ratio. In addition, this arrangement can also serve as an installation retention unit for circuit components such as large electrolytic condensers, thereby increasing the integration ratio, and reducing the size of the device.<br>
In this embodiment, it is also possible to substitute a ceramic substrate or the like for the aluminum substrate 301.<br>

The heat dissipating fins 571 are comprised of a plurality of plate shaped fin members 575 that project fi^om the side opposite the attachment surface 574. The fin members 575 are formed to be thin in order to enlarge the surface area, and are disposed with a predetermined distance between each other in order to increase the heat dissipation efficiency thereof<br>
The heat dissipating fins 571, like the aluminum substrate 471, can be comprised of a material such as aluminum nitride having high thermal conductivity and excellent insulation characteristics, and can be produced with a processing method such as drawing or punching.<br>
Like with the aforementioned embodiment, the protrusions 472 of the aluminum substrate 471 are fitted into the grooves 573 of the heat dissipating fins 571. By fitting the protrusions 573 of the heat dissipating fins 571 into the grooves 472 of the aluminum substrate 471, and sliding each protrusion 472, 572 parallel to each other, the attachment surface 574 of the heat dissipating fins 571 can be attached to the corrugated section 474 of the aluminum substrate 471.<br>
Thus, by engaging the protrusions 472 and grooves 473 of the aluminum substrate 471 and the protrusions 572 and grooves 573 of the heat dissipating fins 571, movement that separates the aluminum substrate 471 and the heat dissipating fins 571 can be regulated, and thus they can be maintained in the attached state. In this way, the thermal conduction efficiency between the aluminum substrate 471 and the heat dissipating fins 571 can be maintained at a high level, and screws and the like used for installation can be omitted.<br><br>
The shapes of the corrugated section of the alximinum substrate and the heat dissipating fins are not Umited to the^ shapes shown in the figures, but can be any shape that provides excellent thermal conduction efficiency, hi addition, the circuit structure inside the module is not limited to that shown in the figures, and the corrugated section of the aluminum substrate and the heat dissipating fins can be applied to a variety of modules which comprise circuit components that are thought to produce a great deal of heat.<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, heat dissipating fins 331 can be simply attached directly to the surface opposite the mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301. The heat dissipating fins 331 can be integrally and simultaneously formed with the aluminum nitride plate that forms the aluminum substrate 301, or can be attached to the aluminum substrate 301 by thermally melting them thereto or adhering them thereto.<br>
If the heat dissipating plates 301 are formed to be integral with the surface opposite the bare chip component mounting surface of the aluminum substrate 301, it will not be necessary to install separate heat .dissipating fins, and it will be possible to improve the heat conduction efficiency of the aluminum substrate 301.<br>
