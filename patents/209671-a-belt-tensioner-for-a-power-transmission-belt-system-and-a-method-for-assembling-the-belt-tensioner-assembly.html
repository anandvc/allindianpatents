BELT TENSIONER FOR A POWER TRANSMISSION BELT SYSTEM Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to a belt tensioner for a transmission  belt  system,   and  more  specifically,   to  an  improved damper assembly for the belt tensioner and a method for constructing the belt tensioner incorporating the improved damper assembly. Background Art<br>
The main purpose of an automatic belt tensioner is to prolong the life of an engine or accessory drive belt The most typical use for such automatic belt tensioners is on front-end accessory driyes in an automobile engine. This drive includes pulley sheaves for each accessory the belt is required to power, such as the air conditioner, water pump, fan and alternator. Each of these accessories requires varying amounts of power at various times during operation. These power variations, or torsionals, create a slackening and tightening situation of each span of the belt. The belt tensioner is utilized to absorb these torsionals through use of an intemally mounted torsion spring. Reference can be made to U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,095 or 5,803,850 (each of which are incorporated herein by reference) for examples of prior art belt tensioners.<br>
' The automatic belt tensioner will include a tension arm pivotally mounted to a base housing or spring case, where the torsion spring is operatively coupled between the tension arm and the base housing so as to force the distal end of the tension arm against the drive belt, and in turn, to provide sufficient tension force on the drive belt as desired. The size of torsional loads experienced by the. drive belt is sometimes large enough to significantly move the tension arm away from the belt, causing the tension Jn the belt to be temporarily reduced. This is not favorable above a certain degree and squealing<br><br>
and squeaking of the belt may result. Therefore, typical belt tensioners incorporate dampening devices to slow the pivotal movement of the tension arm. Disclosure of the Invention<br>

The present invention is directed to a belt tensioner for a transmission belt system, and more specifically, to an improved damper assembly for the belt tensioner and a method for constructing<br><br>
the belt tensioner incorporating the improved clamper assembly.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1-3, an exemplary embodiment of the belt tensioner 10 for providing a predetermined amount of tension upon a transmission belt 12 of a transmission belt system includes a die-cast aluminum tension arm 14 pivotally mounted to a die-cast aluminum housing or spring case 16 and including a steel torsion spring. 18 operatively coupled between the tension arm and the housing 16, whereby the torsion spring 18 applies a torsional force on the tension arm 14 in the direction shown by arrow A (Fig. 1), such that the distal end 20 of the tension arm 14 applies a corresponding tension force upon the transmission belt 12. While the tension arm 14 and housing 16 are indicated as being manufactured from die-cast aluminum and while the torsion spring 18 is identified as being manufactured from steel, it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize suitable alternative materials (or combination of materials/components) to construct such components. Additionally, while the torsion spring 18 in the exemplary embodiment is a coil spring, it is within the scope of the invention to use other suitable springs, such as a fiat wire spring.<br>
A pulley 22 is mounted for rotation to the distal end 20 of the tension arm 14 by a bolt 24 extending through the hub 26 of the pulley 22 and into a threaded bore 28 of the distal end 20 of the tension arm 14. The pulley 22 is joumaled to the distal end 20 of the tension arm 14 by appropriate roller bearings 30, A dust cover 32 in the shape of a washer with an annular flange 34 extending axially inwardly from the hub of the washer is coaxlally mounted between the bearings 30 and the head 36 of the bolt 24 to protect the bearings 30 from contamination.<br>
The housing 16 is generally bowl-shaped and includes a pivot shaft 38 extending coaxlally upward from the inner surface of the<br><br>
convex side of the bowl-shaped housing. A tubular, wear resistant plastic bushing 40 is positioned around the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft 38. The proximal end 42 of the arm 14 is a complementary bowl-shaped pivot housing 45 that includes a cylindrical pivot tube 44 extending axially downward from the convex side thereof, whereby the pivot tube 44 is coaxial with the pivot shaft 38 and has an inner diameter that substantially matches (or is slightly larger than) the outer diameter of the bushing 40. Accordingly, the cylindrical pivot tube 44 is used to pivotally mount the tension arm 14 on the pivot shaft 38 of the housing 16. It will be understood that while the bushing 40 in this exemplary embodiment is a wear resistant plastic, it is within the scope of the invention to use other suitable bushing materials or bearing structures.<br>
The housing 16 includes a circumferential outer wall 46 that mates with the complementary circumferential outer wall 48 of the pivot housing 45 of the tension arm 14. An annular space is provided between each of ti^e circumferential outer walls 46, 48 and the cylindrical pivot tube 44 of the tension arm 14, which extends along a substantial portion of the axial length of the pivot shaft 38 extending from the housing 16. This annular space provided within the circumferential walls 46, 48 provides an annular cavity 50 for seating the torsion spring 18 therein. A first end 52 of the torsion spring is attached to the inner surface of the housing 16 and the opposite end 54 of the torsion spring is attached to the inner surface of the pivot housing 45 of the tension arm 14. An annular outer bushing 56 formed from wear resistant plastic is positioned axially between the circumferential wall 46 of the housing and the circumferential wall 48 of the pivot housing 45 of the tension arm 14. The outer bushing 56, which includes axially extending annular flanges 57 seated within<br><br>
complementary annular grooves 59, 61 of the respective housings 16,<br>
45,	acts as a bearing surface between the circumferential outer walls<br>
46,	48 of the respective housings 16, 45 and also acts to seal the annular cavity 50 seating the torsion spring 18 therein from external contaminants. Again, it will be understood that while the outer bushing 56 in this exemplary embodiment is a wear resistant plastic, it is within the scope of the invention to use other suitable bushing materials or bearing structures.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the pivot tube 38 is a solid steel (or other suitable material, such as aluminum or powdered metal) insert that includes a center bore 58 for receiving an attachment bolt 60 therein and a larger diameter counter-bore 62 extending into its upper end 64 to provide a seat for the head 66 of the attachment bolt 60 and is also useful in an assembly process, as will be described in further detail below. The retaining 0-ring 68 shown in the figures is used to prevent the attachment bolt 60 from exiting out from the central bore 58 of the pivot tube 38 during shipment The outer circumferential surface of the pivot housing 45 of the tension ami 14 Includes a radially extending projection 70 and the outer circumferential surface of the housing 16 includes a radially projecting and upwardly extending projection 72 having an axial position substantially matching tiiat of tiie projection 70 on Uie tension ami. Accordingly, the projection 70 acts as a tension arm stop for abutting against the projection 72 to limit rotation of tiie tension arm 14 in tiie direction indicated by arrow A, thereby prohibiting tiie torsion spring 18 from unwinding completely. Additionally, a certain amount of rotational ti-avel of the tension arm 14 is required to install the belt tensioner on tiie appropriate drive. Accordingly, to avoid over stressing of the torsion spring 18 during this installation process,  a second radially extending projection 74 is<br><br>
provided on the tension arm 14 to limit rotation of the tension arm during the installation process. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that other suitable pivot assemblies for pivotally coupling the tension arm 14 to the housing 16 are available and are thus within the scope of the Invention.<br>
Referring primarily to Figs. 2, 3 &amp; 3a, the exemplary embodiment of the present invention utilizes a damper assembly 76 that also acts as a clamping plate for axially clamping the various components of the belt tensioner together at the proximal end 42 of the tension ami 14. The damper assembly 76 includes a damper spring, or spring plate 78, substantially in the form of a belleville spring integrally molded with, or co-molded with an annular sheath 80 of wear resistant plastic material. Although not shown in the drawings, the spring plate 78 includes a plurality of teeth or projections extending radially outwardly from its outer circumferential surface and into the sheath for prohibiting rotation of the sheath 80 with respect to the spring plate 78. The spring plate 78 is, in the exemplary embodiment, a hardened steel plate and the wear resistant plastic material of the sheath 80 is, in the exemplary embodiment, a polyamide 46 nylon material. Of course, it is within the scope of the invention to utilize suitable alternative materials (or combinations of materials and components). For example, suitable alternative friction materials include, but are not limited to: all polyamides (PA) including 66 nylon, 6 nylon, 11 nylon, 12 nylon, 69 nylon, 612 nylon, and 610 nylon; polyetherimides (PEl); polysulfones (PSU); polyethersulfones (PES or PESU); polyoxymethylenes (POM), or acetals; polyetheretherketones (PEEK); polyphenylene sulfides (PPS); polyphthalamides (PPA), or amodels; and amorphous nylons."<br>
Refening to Figs. 3 and 3a in particular, the sheath 80 of<br><br>
wear-resistant plastic material molded over the spring plate 78 includes a substantially planar and annular friction segment 82 positioned axially between the spring plate 78 and the upper rub surface 84 of the pivot housing 45 of the tension arm 14. Referring primarily to Fig. 2, the upper rub surface 84 of the pivot housing 45 is a substantially planar and annular surface that resides on a plane substantially perpendicular to the pivot axis X.<br>
Referring back to Figs. 3 and 3a, the friction segment 82 of the sheath 80 of wear-resistant plastic material preferably extends along a substantial portion of the radial width of the rub surface 84 and includes a friction surface 86 abutting \he rub surface 84 of the tension arm 14. The sheath 80 also includes an annular clamp segment or flap 88 extending around a circumferential outer surface of the spring plate 78 and at least partially over an upper annular surface of the spring plate 78 so as to retain the sheath 80 to the spring plate 78, The wear resistant plastic sheath 80 also includes an annular bead or flange 90 extending axially downward from an outer circumference of the sheath 80 over an annular shoulder 92 extending into an upper surface of tiie housing 45 of the tension arm 14. This flange 90 completely encircles the annular shoulder 92, providing a labyrinth seal between tiie damper assembly 76 and the tension ami 14, In the exemplary embodiment, a radial gap is provided between the flange 90 and the shoulder 92 to ensure that tiie dampening is controlled primarily by contact between the friction surface 86 and the rub surface 84. Further, while the flange 90 in the exemplary embodiment is generally in the shape of an annular bead, it is within the scope of the invention to utilize alternative shapes for the flange 90 and/or altemative stiuctures for tine labyrinth seal provided by the flange 90.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the inner circumferential surface 94 of<br><br>
the center hole 96 extending through the spring plate 78 includes a plurality of teeth 98 extending radially inwardly therefrom. These teeth are embedded into the outer circumferential surface 100 of the pivot shaft 38 at the upper end 64 of the pivot shaft to securely attach the damper assembly 76 to the pivot shaft and consequently, to retain the proximal end 42 of the tension arm 14 axially between the base housing 16 and the damper assembly 76. This, in turn, retains the torsion spring 18 within the annular chamber 50. The biasing properties of the spring plate 78 (due to the substantially conical shape of the spring plate) also acts to force the friction segment 82 of the wear resistant plastic sheath 80 against the rub surface 84 of the housing 45 of the tension arm 14. The resulting frictional engagement between the friction surface 86 of the friction segment 82 and the rub surface 84 of the housing 45 acts to dampen severe pivotal movements of the tension ami 14 due to the torsionals experienced by the drive belt 12.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the damper assembly 76 is constructed by first over-molding the sheath 80 of wear resistant plastic material over a substantially flat hardened steel washer 78\ This co-molded component 102 must then be acted upon by a deforming work piece 104 to deform the washer 78* into its preferred, substantially conical shape as shown in Fig. 3. The work piece 104 has a substantially conical or frustoconical working end 106, where the sloping angles S of the working end 106 slope at the desired angle of deflection for the spring plate 78. The work piece 104 is coaxially applied against the co-molded piece 102 (or vice-versa) to deform the washer 78* until it achieves its desired shape. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the greater the deflection angle S, the greater the biasing force that will be applied by the spring plate 78.<br>
As discussed above, the damper assembly 76 also acts<br><br>
as a clamp plate to clamp the components of the belt tensioner together on the pivot shaft 38. As shown in Fig. 5, once the pivot bushing 40. outer bushing 56. housing 45 of the tension arm 14, torsion spring 18 and damper assembly 76 have been stacked on the base housing 16, or otherwise positioned coaxial with the pivot shaft 38, a diametrically expanding work piece 108. having a final outer diameter slightly larger than the inner diameter of the counter-bore 62 extending into the upper end 64 of the pivot shaft 38, is positioned into the counter bore 62 and diametrically expanded such that the circumferential walls 110 of the counter bore 62 are forced radially outwardly, into the teeth 98 on the inner circumferential surface 94 of the center hole 96 extending through the spring plate 78 so that the teeth 98 become embedded into the circumferential walls 110, thereby fixedly attaching the spring plate 78 and damper assembly 76 to the pivot shaft 38, and in turn, retaining the base housing 16, outer bushing 56, tension arm 14, pivot bushing 40, torsion spring 18 and damper assembly 76 altogether on the pivot shaft 38. It will be appreciated that there are other suitable coupling/retaining methods available to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as the use of radial riveting, all of which fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
Some identified advantages of the belt tensioner 10 and damper assembly 76 described above include, but are not limited to: an overall reduction in the amount of components needed for the belt tensioner; a reduced cost in manufacturing the belt tensioner; a damper assembly that has a dual purpose of dampening rotation of the torsion arm and coupling components of the belt tensioner to the base housing; a spring plate that has a dual purpose of dampening rotation of the torsion amn and coupling components of the belt tensioner to the base housing; a damper assembly that includes a labyrinth seal; and a<br><br>
single piece damper assembly utilizing a co-molded spring and friction material.
