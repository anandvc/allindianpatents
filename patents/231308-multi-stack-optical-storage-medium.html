DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
i	The invention relates to a multi-stack optical storage medium. The invention also<br>
relates to a method of manufacturing such an optical storage medium.<br>
The invention is particularly relevant for a dual-stack write-once optical storage medium using the DVD format.<br>
I     Domain of the invention<br>
Recently the Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) has gained market share as a medium with much higher data storage capacity than the CD. Presently, this format is available in a readÂ¬only (ROM), a recordable or a write-once (R) and a rewritable (RW) version.<br>
A write-once or rewritable optical storage medium like a DVD comprises a recording<br>
!     stack comprising a recording layer. Recording of information in the optical storage medium<br>
occurs by locally modifying the optical properties of the recording layer with an intense laser<br>
beam. The recorded parts are usually referred to as pits or marks. An issue for both the write-<br>
once and the rewritable DVD format is the limited capacity and resulting recording time,<br>
because only single-stacked media are present with a maximum capacity of 4.7 GB.<br>
I	A DVD-video, which is a ROM disk, dual-stack medium with 8.5 GB capacity, often<br>
referred to as DVD-9, already has a considerable market share, but information carmot be written on such DVDs.<br>
Consequently, write-once DVDs with at least two stacks, which provide a capacity around 8.5 GB, are highly desired.<br>
A problem raised by a dual-stack write-once optical storage medium is that the recording of data inevitably introduces local variations in the optical properties of the recording stacks. When accessing a recording stack through a written higher recording stack, the local variations in optical properties of the higher recording stack may deteriorate the focused optical beam used for reading and writing of the lower recording stack. If the aberrations introduced by the higher recording stack are too severe, writing and/or reading of the lower stacks may become impossible or of unacceptable quality.<br>
Among the conditions which must be fulfilled by the stacks of the optical storage medium in order to limit the aberrations introduced by a higher recording stack to an<br><br>
acceptable level, is a reduction of the phase difference of the light transmitted through written and unwritten parts of the higher recording stack.<br>
Figs, la and lb show an optical storage medium comprising a higher recording stack USTo, RSTo and a lower recording stack STi. The recording layer of the lower recording stack STi is being recorded or read back by a laser beam 4, which is focused on said lower recording stack STi. Said laser beam 4 has a wave front 5, 7 and a focal spot 6, 8. In Fig. la, in which the higher recording stack USTo is unrecorded, the focused laser beam 4 does not present any aberration of its wave front 5 or focal spot 6. In Fig. lb, in which the higher recording stack RSTo contains recorded data, the focused laser beam 4 shows some aberrations in its wave front 7 and in its focal spot 8.<br>
A write-once DVD (DVD-R) with two recording stacks is disclosed in the Japanese patent application published on the IS'^ of April 2001 with the publication number 2001-101709. Said recording stacks have a so-called MIM structure, which comprises a top thin metal recording layer M, an interference layer I, and another thin metal layer M. The solution proposed ensures that, using a focused laser beam with a wavelength X, the phase difference of the light transmitted through written and unwritten parts of the higher recording stack is always less than 10 degrees or equivalently less than 0.02 times X, which is obtained by making a recording layer sufficiently thin. For example, using a wavelength of 655 nm, the optical thickness of the first recording layer, which is equal to the product of the refractive index and the thickness of the first recording layer, must be less than 13 run.<br>
The main drawback of this solution is that the manufacture of such a thin metal recording layer is quite difficult.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a solution for implementing an optical storage medium with at least two recording stacks which is easier to manufacture.<br>
This is achieved with an optical storage medium comprising on an entrance face a higher recording stack having a thickness dk and a refractive index nR and at least a lower recording stack, said lower recording stack being recorded or read back by a radiation beam entering the optical storage medium through the entrance face with a wavelength X, focused on said lower recording stack, and transmitted through the higher recording stack, a recording of the higher recording layer causing an optical thickness variation A(nR.dR) between recorded and unrecorded areas of said first recording layer which lies within the range rO.037., 0.125X1.<br><br>
According to the invention, an optical storage medium is provided which ensures that, using a focused radiation beam with a wavelength X, data recording of the higher recording layer will not modify optical properties of the radiation beam to such an extent that recording or reading back of a lower recording stack will be deteriorated. In particular, the optical storage medium in accordance with the invention ensures that the radiation beam is transmitted through a zone of the higher recording layer comprising recorded and unrecorded areas with a local wave front phase variation A<e which always remains within the range of higher recording layer has a thickness dr and refractive index nr. in optical storage medium accordance with invention causes change is product said nr layer. local wave front phase variation can be estimated by realizing that it mainly results difference transmission. thus following equation eqj obtained:></e>
A^ = A(nR. dR)Â« AnR. dR + HR. AdR	(EQi)<br>
The higher recording layer comprises a recording material which is, for example, an organic dye material. It should be noted that for organic dye materials, data recording is mainly induced by a change (decrease) of the refractive index AHR. Therefore, equation EQj reduces to equation EQIB:<br>
A<e ahr. dr></e>
In both cases, the condition imposed on AO is fulfilled by choosing an appropriate hickness dR of the higher recording layer.<br>
If we consider a focused radiation beam having a wavelength X being transmitted ^u-ough a higher recording layer containing recorded data, the upper limit on AO of 0.125X an be derived as follows. The Mar6chal criterion states that a focal spot remains "diffraction mited" if the root-mean-square (RMS) wave front error WCRMS = V|<w>^ - <w that is troduced by the local wave front phase variations a less than in recorded ea fraction x of recording layer contains marks typically when transmitted through containing data each mark roduces shift ao to part incident on mark. iraged over total rms error becomes wcrms="AO.V(x-x^).&lt;br/"><br>
A conservative estimate of the maximum allowed AO is obtained by taking x = 1/4 and this results in AO ^ 0.072X/V(3/16), i.e. AO ^ 0.125X. The lower limit for AO is determined by considerations on modulation. Modulation stands for the maximum amplitude of the signals coming from the disc. Modulation of the signal is defined as the difference between the highest signal level and the lowest signal level, normalized by the highest signal level coming from the disk. For a recording material like an organic dye material, in which the refractive index is changed by a recording process, it turns out that when AO is less than 0.03A,, the modulation becomes too weak for allowing a reliable read-back of the recorded disk.<br>
It should be noted that the optical thickness A(nR. dn) of the higher recording layer is preferably chosen in the range of values [0.05X,, 0.09A,], most preferably chosen in the range of values [0.06X, 0.08A,], for example equal to 0.O73A,, because these values give the best compromise between modulation of the signal and local wave front phase variation.<br>
A consequence of the above-mentioned condition for the local wave front phase change is that the higher recording layer of the optical storage medium in accordance with the invention does not need to be as thin as the one used in the MIM structure in accordance with the prior art. Said higher recording layer is thus easier to manufacture. Using, for example, an organic dye material having a refractive index of 2.2 in ururecorded areas and of 1.6 in recorded areas of the higher recording layer, an optical storage medium in accordance with the invention using the DVD format, that is with a radiation beam having a wavelength of approximately 655 nm, must have a higher recording layer thickness dR in the range 28 nm <dr></dr>
In a first embodiment of the invention, said higher recording layer (Lo) is made of an organic dye material. An advantage of the use of a higher recording layer made of an organic dye over a higher recording layer made of thin metal is that organic dyes require lower temperatures (200-300 Â°C) than thin metal films (at least 300-400Â°C) to achieve recording. Moreover, organic dyes have a very low heat conductivity, that is they lose their heat at a comparatively low rate, whereas metals have high heat conductivity and thus lose heat at a higher rate. The higher recording stack structure according to the first embodiment of the invention therefore requires a lower recording power than does the MIM stack structure. For example, at IX speed, that is the standard speed of 3.49 m/s for DVDs, organic dye materials typically require less than 10 mW, whereas the MIM structure requires 12 mW. Said higher recording layer is therefore less power consuming, which is advantageous for portable applications.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An optical storage medium in accordance with the invention is shown in Fig. 2. Said optical storage medium comprises below an entrance face EF a substrate 1, a higher recording stack STo, a spacer layer 2, a lower recording stack ST,, and a second substrate 3. The higher recording stack STo comprises a higher recording layer LQ and a thin metal<br><br>
reflector layer MQ. The lower recording stack STi comprises a lower recording layer Li and a thick metal reflector layer Mi.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, the higher recording layer Lo is made, for example, of organic dye having a refractive index HR and a variation Ana of refractive index between unrecorded and recorded parts of the layer Lo. This is not limitative, however, because the higher recording layer Lo may equally well be made of any recording material in which the recording process is based on a change in its refractive index.<br>
It should be noted as well that, although in this embodiment of the invention the recording stack only comprises one recording layer Lo and one thin metal layer Mo, the invention also applies to more complicated recording stacks.<br>
Said organic dye material enables write-once data recording, as it is deteriorated by the recording process in such a way that data recording cannot be repeated. Consequently the first embodiment of the invention relates to a write-once optical storage medium. It should be noted, however, that the invention also concerns a rewritable optical storage medium, wherein the higher recording layer is made of a rewritable material, such that data recording causes a change in optical thickness of said rewritable material.<br>
Fig. 3a shows the structure of the higher recording stack STo in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention. The organic dye material is, for example AZO or cyanine dye. The higher recording layer Lo is applied to the transparent pre-grooved substrate 1. The substrate 1 has a thickness value preferably lying within the range [0.30 mm, 1.2 mm], for example equal to 0.575 mm. It should be noted that a smaller range of authorized thickness values of [0.56 mm, 0.60 mm] is preferably used for DVDs.<br>
The higher recording layer LQ comprises grooves G and lands L. A groove G has, for example, a depth 10 of 160 nm and a width 15 of 320 nm. The distance between two grooves, also called track pitch 19, preferably equals 740 nm. The higher recording layer Lo usually comprises at least two different values of its thickness dR, which are a thickness on groove 13 of, for example, 60, 80, or 100 nm (upper limit is 115 nm), and a thickness on land 14 of 15, 25, or 40 nm. The thin metal layer Mo has a thickness value 12 preferably in the range of [5 nm, 25 nm] and, for example, equal to 12 nm. An arrow 6 indicates the direction and position of the focused laser beam used for recording and reading the optical storage medium. For recordable DVDs, the focused laser beam has a wavelength X approximately equal to 655 nm and a numerical aperture NA equal to 0.65. The transparent spacer layer 2 has a depth value substantially greater than the depth of focus of the focused radiation beam, which preferably lies within a range of [0.03 mm, 0.07 mm] and more preferably is equal to 0,05 mm.<br><br>
An optical disc in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention may be manufactured as follows: the polycarbonate substrate 1 is molded by a stamper, which creates grooves G in the substrate 1. The organic dye material intended to form the higher recording layer Lo is applied, for example, by means of spin-coating onto the pre-grooved substrate 1. Next, a semitransparent mirror made of silver alloy, called thin metal reflector layer Mo, is applied, for example by sputtering. On top of the thin metal layer Mo, a spacer layer 2 is fabricated by applying a UV-curable lacquer. The grooves G of the substrate 1 are replicated in the lacquer by pressing a stamper (for example of Zeonor). The lacquer is subsequently exposed to UV in order to cure it. On top of the grooves of the spacer layer 2, a new dye-based recording layer Li is applied. Next, a thick metal reflector layer M\ is applied. The optical disc is finalized by gluing a dummy substrate 3 to the back of the thick metal layer.<br>
An advantage of the use of a higher recording layer made of organic dye is that the organic dye can be applied by spin-coating, whereas the MIM structure requires additional sputter deposition steps for the interference layer and the thin metal recording layer. Spin-coating is easier to implement than sputtering. The fabrication procedure for the optical storage medium in accordance with the invention is therefore cheaper.<br>
It is to be noted that the above-mentioned manufacturing method relates to dual-stack optical media, but that those skilled in the art should be able to derive a similar method for multi-stack optical media.<br>
Fig. 3b shows the differences in optical path length transmitted through an empty groove 20, a land 21, and a recorded groove 22. In the case of a dye-based recording stack STo, the fact that the first recording layer Lo comprises grooves and lands, also called leveling, introduces three different phases in transmission, which are a phase of land <i>L of the focused optical beam 24 when passing trough a land 21, a phase of empty groove <i of the focused optical beam when passing trough an empty groove and a phase recorded ogr obtained differences are following:></i>
-	OGE - OGR = AnR.do (EQ2), where do is the groove depth 13 and AHR the variation of the<br>
refractive index HR of the dye-based recording layer.<br>
.    4)GE - ^L = ("R - no).(dG - di) (EQ3), where no is the refractive index of the substrate 1 and dL the land depth 14,<br>
-	OL- ^GR = AuR.dc - (HR - no).(dG - dt) (EQ4).<br><br>
Equation EQ2 is equivalent to equation EQi. Another point is that a phase difference smaller than 0.125.X, is required for these three equations. However, with dye-based recording materials, AUR Â« HR - no. Consequently, it turns out that the largest phase difference is given by equations EQi and EQ2, which means that only EQi needs to be considered in the design of the first recording layer LQ.<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b show the optical constants of two types of organic dye materials as fiinctions of the wavelength X. The optical constant of a material is the complex refiractive index ii = n + i.k. In the first embodiment of the invention, the wavelength X equals 655 nm and either an AZO dye material with a real part HRI of the refractive index approximately equal to 2.3 or a cyanine dye material with a real part URJ of the refractive index equal to 2.2 is used. When data are recorded into the recording layer, the refi-active index falls to approximately 1.6.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the modulation as a function of the product of the refractive index variation and the thickness of the first recording layer. For DVDs, the modulation is expected to remain greater than 0.6. For other applications, values lower than 0.6 may be acceptable.<br>
It turns out that choosing a first recording layer Lo with a thickness AnR.dR greater than 0.06.A. guarantees a modulation value above 0.6.<br>
Fig, 6 shows a diagram indicating jitter measurements of data read back from the second recording layer Li through the partially recorded recording layer LQ. Gray bands indicate the radii of the optical disk for which data have been recorded on the first recording layer LQ.<br>
In optical disks, data are encoded in the lengths of pits and of the unrecorded areas that are in between the pits, also called spaces, that are recorded on the disk. It should be noted that the actual recording of marks does not necessarily take place in the groove G but may take place in the area L between grooves, also referred to as lands. On this case the guide groove G merely serves as a servo tracking means with the actual radiation beam recording spot being present on the land.<br>
A length should be an integer multiple of a predefined channel bit length. For example, the predefined channel bit length equals 146.7 nm for a dual-layer density DVD. Since it is not possible to record such a length precisely, an evaluation of the error made in the recording of the lengths is highly needed.<br><br>
I<br>
A possible measurement of such an error is provided by the jitter. The jitter is defined as the width of the distribution of the leading and trailing edges of the pits and spaces with respect to the expected or ideal positions of these edges, which is given by the predefined channel bit length. What is actually measured in the experiments is the distribution in timing errors of the leading and trailing edges of the signals coming fi-om the disk during read-out with respect to the expected timing. Said timing is given by the ratio of the bit length and the read velocity. The average jitter curve 30 shows that the recording of the first recording layer Lo of an optical storage medium according to the invention only causes a small increase of the jitter values, which corresponds to only small deteriorations of the conditions for reading the second recording layer Li.<br>
It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs places between parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claims. The word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those listed in a claim. The word "a" or "an" preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually I     different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.<br><br><br>
