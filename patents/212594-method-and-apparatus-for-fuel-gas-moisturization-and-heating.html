				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FUEL GAS<br>
MOISTURIZATION AND HEATING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to natural gas fired combined cycle power<br>
plants and, in particular, to a modified bottoming cycle for fuel gas saturation<br>
and heating to increase power output and thermodynamic efficiency.<br>
In conventional bottoming cycle Heat Recovery Steam Generators, (HRSG)<br>
there is a large temperature difference between the hot gas and the cold water<br>
in the lower pressure economizer (LP-EC) resulting in thermodynamic energy<br>
(thermodynamic potential) losses which limit the power output in the cycle.<br>
Heretofore there have been attempts to design bottoming cycles for better<br>
temperature matching in the HRSG, such as the Kalina cycle, which uses a<br>
multi-component fluid, e.g., ammonia and water, with non-isothermal boiling<br>
characteristics. Such multi-component fluid cycles provide better<br>
temperature matching in the entire HRSG and efficiency gains. However,<br>
significant practical difficulties exist in using multi-component fluids in<br>
bottoming cycles.<br>
Fuel heating is currently implemented in some combined cycle power plants<br>
for improving thermal efficiency. Although current fuel heating methods<br>
result in plant power output reduction, when heating the fuel above the LP<br>
steam temperature, the gain in thermal efficiency as a result of the decreased<br>
heat consumption makes fuel heating an economically attractive design<br>
option. However, there remains a need for a method and apparatus for<br>
achieving a better temperature matching in the HRSG while avoiding power<br>
plant output reduction.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The bottoming cycle design method according to a presently preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention results in better temperature matching<br>
between the hot and cold heat exchange streams below the lowest pressure<br>
evaporator temperature by providing a water heating section for fuel gas<br>
saturation in parallel with the lower pressure economizer (LP-EC) in the heat<br>
recovery steam generator. Thus, the heat source for fuel gas saturation in the<br>
current invention is the gas turbine exhaust gases. The increased gas mass<br>
flow due to the addition of moisture results in increased power output from<br>
the gas and steam turbines. Fuel gas saturation is followed by superheating<br>
the fuel, preferably with bottom cycle heat sources, resulting in a larger<br>
thermal efficiency gain compared to current fuel heating methods. There is a<br>
gain in power output compared to no fuel heating, even when heating the fuel<br>
to above the LP steam temperature. As noted above, current fuel heating<br>
methods would result in a power output loss compared to no fuel heating.<br>
Thus, fuel gas saturation and subsequent super heating with the cycle of the<br>
invention results in increased power output and thermodynamic efficiency<br>
compared to a conventional combined cycle with fuel heating to the same<br>
temperature or a cycle with no fuel heating. This improved performance is a<br>
result of the reduced should be energy losses in the HRSG with the modified bottoming<br>
cycle described.<br>
The invention is thus embodied in a combined cycle system including a gas<br>
turbine, a steam turbine, and a heat recovery steam generator, wherein gas<br>
turbine exhaust gas is used in the heat recovery steam generator for<br>
generating steam for the steam turbine, said gas turbine exhaust gas flowing<br>
from an entry end to an exit end of the heat recovery steam generator, and<br>
wherein the system further comprises a fuel gas saturator assembly for<br>
saturating fuel gas with water and heating the fuel gas, the heat recovery<br>
steam generator (HRSG) including a first water heater for heating water with<br>
heat from the exhaust gases, to define a heat source for the fuel gas saturator<br>
assembly; and a fuel gas superheater for superheating fuel gas that has been<br>
saturated and heated by the fuel gas saturator assembly for supply to the gas<br>
turbine.<br>
In one embodiment, the fuel gas saturator assembly comprises a fuel gas<br>
saturator packed column, for saturating and heating fuel gas with heated<br>
water received from the first water heater of the HRSG. In another<br>
embodiment, the fuel gas saturator assembly comprises a water inlet for<br>
adding water to the fuel gas and a heat exchanger for heating fuel gas<br>
saturated with the water input at the water inlet. In this case, the heat<br>
exchanger receives and uses the heated water from the first water heater to<br>
heat the fuel gas. Whether a heat exchanger or a saturator column is used, in<br>
a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fuel superheater heats the<br>
saturated fuel gas using a heat recovery steam generator heat source.<br>
The invention is also embodied in a method for increasing power output and<br>
thermodynamic efficiency in a combined cycle system including a gas turbine,<br>
a steam turbine, and a heat recovery steam generator, wherein gas turbine<br>
exhaust gas is used in the heat recovery steam generator for generating steam<br>
for the steam turbine, said gas turbine exhaust gas flowing from an entry end<br>
to an exit end of the heat recovery steam generator, the method comprising<br>
the steps of adding water to and heating fuel gas to produce heated, saturated<br>
fuel gas, the heat being derived from the heat recovery steam generator,<br>
feeding the saturated fuel gas to a fuel superheater; further heating the<br>
saturated fuel gas in the fuel superheater to superheat the fuel gas; and<br>
feeding the superheated, saturated fuel gas to the gas turbine. In a preferred<br>
implementation, the saturated fuel gas is also heated with heat derived from a<br>
heat source in the heat recovery steam generator.<br>
The herein described modified bottoming cycle and method is applicable in<br>
particular to natural gas fire combined cycle applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A schematic of a conventional three pressure reheat combined cycle power<br>
plant with fuel heating 10 is shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
This example includes a gas turbine system 12 comprising a combustion<br>
system 14 and a gas turbine 16, and a steam turbine system 18 including a<br>
high pressure section 20, an intermediate pressure section 22, and one or more<br>
low pressure sections 24 with multiple steam admission points at different<br>
pressures. The low pressure section 24 exhausts into a condenser 26. The<br>
steam turbine 18 drives the generator 28 which produces electrical power.<br>
The gas turbine 12, steam turbine system 18, and generator 28 are arranged in<br>
tandem, on a single shaft 30.<br>
The steam turbine system 18 is associated with a multi-pressure HRSG 32<br>
which includes a low pressure economizer (LP-EC), a low pressure<br>
evaporator(LP-EV), a high pressure economizer (HP-EC-2), an intermediate<br>
pressure economizer (IP-EC), an intermediate pressure evaporator (IP-EV), a<br>
low pressure superheater (LP-SH), a final high pressure economizer (HP-EC-<br>
1), an intermediate pressure superheater (IP-SH), a high pressure evaporator<br>
(HP-EV), a high pressure superheater section (HP-SH-2), a reheater (RH-SH),<br>
and a final high pressure superheater section (HP-SH-1).<br>
Condensate is fed from condenser 26 to the HRSG 32 via conduit 34 with the<br>
aid of condensate pump 36. The condensate subsequently passes through the<br>
LP-EC and into the LP-EV. In a known manner steam from the LP-EV is fed<br>
to the LP-SH and then returned to the low pressure section 24 of the steam<br>
turbine 18 via conduit 38 and appropriate LP admissions stop/ control<br>
valve(s) schematically depicted at 40. Feed water with the aid of feed water<br>
pump(s) 42 passes (1) through the IP-EC via conduit 44 and to the IP-EV via<br>
conduit 48, and (2) through the HP-EC-2 via conduit 46 and then on to the<br>
final HP-EC-1 (conduit not shown). At tne same time, steam from the IP-EV<br>
passes through the IP-SH and then flows through the reheater RH-SH via<br>
conduit 50. The reheated steam is returned to the intermediate pressure<br>
section 22 of the steam turbine 18 via conduit 52.<br>
Meanwhile, condensate in the final HP-EC-1 is passed to the HP-EV. Steam<br>
exiting the HP-EV passes through the superheater sections HP-SH-2-and HP-<br>
SH-1 and is returned to the high pressure section 20 of the steam turbine 18 by<br>
way of conduit 54 and appropriate stop/control valves (if required, not<br>
shown).<br>
The source for fuel heater 56 in this example is an extraction 58 from the<br>
intermediate pressure economizer (IP-EC) outlet. Extraction from other<br>
sections of the HRSG or the steam turbine is also possible. Adding heat to the<br>
fuel from a bottom cycle energy source reduces the heat consumption by an<br>
amount equal to the heat added, with a corresponding reduction in the fuel<br>
gas consumption. Although there is a reduction in the plant net power output<br>
due to the use of a bottom cycle energy source for fuel heating, particularly<br>
when heating the fuel above the LP steam temperature, the reduction of the<br>
heat consumption would result in the increase in the thermodynamic<br>
efficiency if an appropriate heat source is selected. While the economical<br>
value of the increased thermodynamic efficiency is considerably higher than<br>
the cost of the lost power output in most instances, the benefit is nevertheless<br>
reduced due to the loss in the power plant output.<br>
By way of illustration, and with reference to the cycle 10 shown in FIGURE 1,<br>
heating the fuel from 80°F to 365°F with the water leaving the exchanger 56 at<br>
a temperature of 130°F results in an increase in combined cycle net efficiency<br>
by +0.6%, with a reduction in the net power output of -0.25%.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a plot of the heat duty in millions of BTU"s per hour versus<br>
the corresponding temperature of the hot composite (gas) and the cold<br>
composite (boiler feed water), for the LP-EC section of the HRSG 32 in<br>
FIGURE 1. Gases leaving the low pressure evaporator (LP-EV) and entering<br>
the LP-EC are typically between 290-330°F, and 313°F is used for this<br>
example. In this example, a temperature differential of 25°F exists at the gas<br>
inlet to the LP-EC, where the feed water is heated to 288°F, with this<br>
temperature mismatch increasing to approximately 60°F at a gas temperature<br>
of 250°F, and further increasing to approximately 100°F at the LP-EC exit<br>
where the gas enters the stack. This temperature mismatch is a source of<br>
exergy loss inherent in conventional Rankine bottoming cycles.<br>
The basic concept of the invention can be understood with reference to the<br>
schematic representation of FIGURE 3. For convenience components that<br>
correspond to those identified above with reference to FIGURE 1 are<br>
identified with similar reference numerals but are only discussed in particular<br>
as necessary or desirable to an understanding of the fuel saturation and<br>
heating components and process.<br>
Fuel gas is sent to a saturator 160, where moisture is absorbed by direct<br>
contact with hot water in a packed or trayed column. The saturator bottoms<br>
water is heated with gas turbine exhaust gas in the saturator heater 162. The<br>
saturator heater 162 is placed in an optimal location relative to other HRSG<br>
tube banks which heat the cycle working fluid. Makeup water is provided to<br>
the fuel gas saturator 160, to replace the moisture absorbed by the gas. The<br>
saturated fuel gas leaving the saturator 160 is further heated in a fuel<br>
superheater 164 using, in the illustrated embodiment, a bottoming cycle heat<br>
source. The appropriate selection of bottoming cycle heat source(s) for the<br>
saturator heater and the fuel superheater results in a performance<br>
enhancement for the power cycle.<br>
The addition of moisture to the fuel gas at the fuel gas saturator 160 increases<br>
the mass flow of the fuel gas. This increased mass flow increases power<br>
output of both the gas and steam turbines. Moreover, the use of low grade<br>
energy, which would not be useful for steam production, to introduce<br>
moisture and thus increase mass flow to the fuel, results in the gain in<br>
thermodynamic efficiency. This is also reflected as a reduction of the<br>
temperature mismatch in the HRSG below the LP-EV gas exit temperature<br>
and a corresponding decrease in thermodynamic exergy losses in the HRSG<br>
section.<br>
By way of example, a first preferred implementation of the foregoing concept<br>
for a three pressure reheat Combined Cycle Power Plant is shown in FIGURE<br>
4. Again, for convenience, components that correspond to those identified<br>
above with reference to FIGURES 1 and/ or 2 are identified with similar<br>
reference numerals but are only discussed in particular as necessary or<br>
desirable to an understanding of the fuel saturation and heating components<br>
and process.<br>
In the embodiment of FIGURE 4, a section of the low pressure economizer<br>
(LP-EC) has been modified by placing a fuel saturator water heating coil<br>
section (SAT.HTR) 262 in parallel with an economizer section (LP-EC-1). This<br>
modification results in the reduction of the temperature mismatch and should be connect energy<br>
loss in the HRSG 232 below the LP-EV gas exit temperature, and a<br>
corresponding efficiency enhancement with fuel saturation. While in the<br>
illustrated embodiment of saturator heater is shown in parallel to the LP-EC-<br>
1, it could, for example, be arranged in an intertwined arrangement with the<br>
LP-EC-1, or placed at other locations in the HRSG.<br>
The heated saturator water is sent to saturator 260 via conduit 266, where<br>
moisture is absorbed by the fuel gas by direct contact with the hot saturator<br>
water. The saturator bottoms water is returned to the saturator water heater<br>
262, e.g., with the aid of a saturator bottoms pump 268. Makeup water is<br>
provided, for example, from the feed water pump 242 output as shown at F,<br>
to the fuel gas saturator 260, to replace the moisture absorbed by the gas.<br>
Although makeup water for fuel saturation is shown as taken from the feed<br>
water transfer pump 242 discharge and/or from the fuel superheater 264, the<br>
saturator water (saturator makeup) could be taken from any other location in<br>
the cycle, or from an outside source. Thus, the illustrated source(s) are not to<br>
be limiting in this regard.<br>
The saturated fuel gas leaving the saturator 260 is further heated in fuel<br>
superheater 264, preferably using a .bottoming cycle heat source. The heating<br>
source for the fuel superheating in this example is IP-EC discharge water, via<br>
conduit 258, but other heat sources could be used. In the embodiment of<br>
FIGURE 4, the IP-EC discharge water is returned to the IP-EC as shown at G<br>
and/or is used as makeup water for fuel saturation, as mentioned above.<br>
As an illustration, with the gas turbine and ambient conditions identical to<br>
those used for the example depicted in FIGURES 1 and 2, the proposed<br>
system design shown in FIGURE 4 results in a +1.0% gain in combined cycle<br>
net efficiency, and a +0.9% gain in combined cycle net output. In this<br>
example, the gas leaves the LP-EV at 313 °F and the saturator bottoms water is<br>
heated to 298 °F in the saturator heater (SAT.HTR) which is placed, as noted<br>
above, in parallel with LP-EC-1. The boiler feed water is heated to 288 °F in<br>
LP-EC-1&amp;2 as in the previous example.<br>
Fuel gas (100% Methane, CH4) enters the fuel gas saturator at a pressure of<br>
400 psia and a temperature of 80oF. The fuel gas leaves the saturator at 284°F<br>
saturated with water vapor. The saturated fuel gas leaving the gas saturator<br>
has a composition of approximately 86%v CH4 and 14%v H2O. The saturated<br>
fuel gas is subsequently superheated to 365°F in the fuel superheating heat<br>
exchanger 264.<br>
FIGURE 5 shows the plot of heat duty in millions of BTUs per hour versus the<br>
corresponding temperature of the hot composite (gas) and the cold composite<br>
(boiler feed water heating, and saturator bottoms water heating) for the HRSG<br>
section LP-EC-1&amp;2 and the saturator heater, for the system shown in FIGURE<br>
4. In this example, a temperature differential of 15°F exists at the gas inlet to<br>
the HRSG sections after the LP-EV, with the temperature differential<br>
increasing to approximately 35°F at a gas temperature of 250 °F and further<br>
increasing to 80°F at the HRSG exit. The proposed cycle design of FIGURE 4<br>
has thus resulted in a substantial reduction of the temperature mismatch (and<br>
exergy losses) in this example for gas temperatures between 313°F and<br>
approximately 240°F, and a smaller reduction in the temperature mismatch at<br>
lower gas temperatures.<br>
As noted above, the heat source for fuel superheating after saturation could<br>
be an extraction from other points in the HRSG or the Steam Turbine. Further,<br>
while in the example of FIGURE 4, water leaving the fuel superheater is<br>
returned to the IP-EC, that water could be admitted to any other appropriate<br>
location in the bottoming cycle, or to the fuel saturator as makeup water.<br>
FIGURE 6 is a further illustrative embodiment of the invention, in which the<br>
saturated fuel gas leaving the saturator 360 is superheated using the saturator<br>
bottoms liquid rather than cycle working fluid as in the embodiment of<br>
FIGURE 4. As illustrated, the saturator bottoms liquid is initially heated in<br>
the heat exchanger 362 with heat from the HRSG exhaust gases. An<br>
extraction 368 from the outlet of heat exchanger 362 is sent to heat exchanger<br>
370 for further heating. As illustrated, heat exchanger 370 is placed upstream<br>
of heat exchanger 362 in the HRSG 332. Both saturator heaters 362 and 370<br>
are placed in an optimal location relative to other HRSG tube banks which<br>
heat the cycle working fluid. The outlet 372 from heater 370 is used as the<br>
heat source for superheating the saturated fuel gas in heat exchanger 364. The<br>
outlet liquid stream 374 from heater 364 is admitted to the fuel gas saturator<br>
360 after being rejoined with the other flow 376 from the outlet of heat<br>
exchanger 362, for direct contact heat and mass transfer with the fuel gas.<br>
The apparatus and method of superheating the saturated fuel gas shown in<br>
FIGURE 6 provides a performance benefit due to additional moisture<br>
absorption by the gas, and increased safety in the system. The increased<br>
safety of this system is due to the elimination of the potential of fuel gas<br>
mixing with the cycle working fluid, which is a potential safety hazard when<br>
using cycle working fluid as the heat source for heat exchange with the fuel<br>
gas.<br>
The saturator bottoms pump 376 of FIGURE 6, and the like pumps illustrated<br>
in FIGURES 3 and 4, may be located at other positions in the system and<br>
additional pumps may be added to the system depicted. Heater 370 may be<br>
eliminated from the system for some cycle designs with the extraction from<br>
the outlet of heater 362 sent directly to heater 364. Furthermore, although not<br>
illustrated in particular, the saturation water (saturator make-up, or saturator<br>
bottoms) in any of the illustrated embodiments could be heated with low<br>
grade heat sources available in the cycle, such as lube oil heat, which are<br>
normally rejected to cooling water. This would result in a further<br>
performance enhancement to the proposed cycle.<br>
As described above with reference to e.g., FIGURE 3, the fuel gas saturator<br>
assembly for adding water to and heating the fuel gas may be a saturator<br>
packed column. As an alternative, the saturator packed column shown in<br>
FIGURE 3 could be replaced by the combination of a water input and a<br>
fuel/water heat exchanger, as shown in FIGURE 7, while obtaining similar<br>
thermodynamic benefits of moisturizing the fuel. The choice of device<br>
(packed column or heat exchanger) would be determined by the heat and<br>
mass transfer effectiveness of the device, and the overall power plant<br>
economics. In FIGURE 7, the makeup water is sprayed into the fuel gas at the<br>
inlet to the heat exchanger (water atomization for spraying would be either<br>
using a pressure atomized nozzle, air atomized nozzle, or steam atomized. If<br>
steam or air atomized configurations are used it would be extracted from the<br>
