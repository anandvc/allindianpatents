				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to gears. More particularly, it relates to gears, for example transmission gears, having a reduced surface roughness resulting in increased contact fatigue life, improved wear resistance and improved performance.<br>
Background<br>
Many methods of finishing gear teeth are known. For example, in gear hobbing and shaving, a gear is rotated in mesh with a gear-tike cutter tool. The gear-like tool has cutting edges that extend up and down the sides of the teeth parallel to the plane of rotation. This is accompanied by a relative traverse between the gear and the cutter in a plane parallel to the axis of the gear and the cutter. The resulting finished surface roughness is in the range of 40 to 80 micro-inches Ra, where Ra is the arithmetic mean roughness.<br>
Another method of finishing the teeth of a gear is known as gear grinding. In gear grinding, the resulting finished surface roughness is typically 15 to 35 micro-inches Ra.<br>
In another method of gear finishing, a honing operation is performed. Here, the gear is rotated in mesh with a gear-shaped hone. Portions of the hone at the said of the gear teeth are fabricated from a plastic material that is relatively hard yet highly resilient. The honing operation occurs by rotating the hone in mesh with the gear while providing a traverse stroke parallel to the axis of the gear. This distributes the finishing action evenly throughout each gear tooth. The resulting roughness is typically 15 to 35 micro-inches Ra. Fine grit honing may yield surface roughness as low as 12 to 13 micro-inches Ra.<br>
l<br><br>
However, none of these finishing methods can improve the surface finish below approximately 10-12 micro-inches without significantly increasing the cost and process time.<br>
Polishing compounds used for preparing metal parts for electroplating have been available, using liquid polishing compounds containing fine abrasive particulate. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,491.500 teaches a physicochemical process for refining metal surfaces. The disclosed two-step process first utilizes a liquid chemical followed by a burnishing liquid. It former involves the development of a relatively soft coating on the surface being treated, followed by the physical removal of the soft coating and continuous repair. Rougher areas greater man 70 urn are first leveled through some form of mechanical action. U.S. Patent No. 4.818.333 describes a similar process, focusing on the composition of a high density burnishing media used in the process. These processes can result in finishes less than 3 micro-inches Ra. Thus, processes and chemicals are described for reducing surface roughness.<br>
Chemical finishing techniques such as etching and bright dipping are also widely known in the art of electroplating preparation for the purpose of achieving an ultra-smooth and clean surface.<br>
The main failure modes for gears are pitting or micropitting, wear and scuffing. When a gear and pinion interact, the gear teeth necessarily contact each other. Without lubrication, the teeth scratch against each other, scuff each other, wear down, pit and crack. Lubrication postpones the onset of these effects. Thus, the better the lubrication, the longer the life of the gear. Gears with surfaces that are too rough have surface peaks mat will damage the gear teem as they interact. Gears with surfaces that are too smooth, for example below 3 micro-inches Ra, cannot retain sufficient lubrication between adjacent teeth, resulting in an increased tooth wear rate.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for gears having properly shaped teeth with improved surface finishes below approximately 10 micro-inches Ra in order to maximize the life and overall performance of gears.<br>
2<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a gear having a surface finish between approximately 5 micro-inches to approximately 10 micro-inches Ra for improved contact fatigue life, improved wear resistance, reduced friction and improved gear performance.<br>
Most gears are manufactured using various gear cutting and shaping techniques, including hobbing and shaving, which result in surface roughness greater than 15 micro-inches Ra, Numerous methods exist for polishing metal surfaces in order to get a reduced surface roughness, including chemically accelerated vibratory polishing, electrochemical polishing, and mechanical polishing.  When surface roughness is reduced to between approximately 5 micro-inches Ra to 10 micro-inches Ra, the maximum contact stress can be reduced more than fifty percent (50%). Similarly, the subsurface shear stress can be possibly reduced by approximately thirty percent (30%) to fifty percent (50%). The reduced contact stress and reduced shear stress results from improved lubrication conditions between the gear teeth. That is, the smoother the gear surface, and therefore the lower the roughness, the higher the film thickness ratio, X, and the greater the overall lubrication. As the film thickness ratio is increased, the lubrication is better, therefore the friction is lower, and the surfaces are better separated with a layer of lubricant. As a result of both surfaces not having at most limited direct peak contact, the contact pressure and the subsurface stresses are reduced. Also, the heat generation and the temperature rise in the gear<br>
tooth contact will be reduced due to the feet that direct rough surface peak contact and<br>
rubbing are the main cause of high friction and heat generation. Reduce operating<br>
temperature and better controlled thermal equilibrium condition would greatly improve customer satisfaction, increase life and reduce warranty cost for geared products such as transmissions. It will also reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency.<br>
It is also possible, however, to have a gear that is too smooth. For example, a gear with a surface roughness of approximately 1 micro-inch Ra to approximately 3<br>
3<br><br>
micro-inch Ra is too smooth, resulting in reduced oil retention for lubrication. This is because the lubricant requires some degree of surface roughness from which to adhere.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The preferred embodiments of this invention will be described in detail, with reference to the following figures, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a spur gear pair;<br>
Fig. 2 is a partial side view of a spur gear depicting the different parts of the gear and teeth;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a perspective of a surface with traditional nobbed and shaved surface finish.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a perspective of a surface following physicochemical polishing.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a spur gear combination 10. Spur gear combinations 10 is made up of a gear 12 and a pinion 14. The pinion 14, by convention, is the smaller of the two gears. Spur gears 10 are used to transmit motion and power between parallel shafts 16, IS. The teeth 20 are generally straight and run generally parallel to the shaft axis.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a partial side view of a spur gear depicting the different parts of the gear 12 and teeth 20. The pitch circle diameter 22 is the basis of measurement of gears 12, and represents the size of the gear. The circular pitch 24 is the distance from the center of one tooth 20 to the center of the next tooth measured around the circumference of the pitch circle 26. The diametrical pitch of the gear 12 is the number of teeth to one inch of the pitch diameter. For example, if a gear 12 has sixteen (16) teeth and the pitch diameter is four (4) inches, the gear has a four (4) teeth to each inch of its pitch diameter and is called 4 diametrical pitch, or 2 D.P. Spur gears 10 are generally fabricated from cast iron, steel, bronze and brass, or other<br>
4<br><br>
strong metals. However, they may also be fabricated using nylon or other plastics for silent running.<br>
It will be understood by one of skill in the art that this invention relates to gears of different types, including, but not limited to, rack and pinion gear systems for converting rotary motion to linear motion; internal gear systems, helical gear systems, herringbone gear systems, bevel gear systems, worm gear systems and planetary gear systems.<br>
Table 1 shows analysis results of different surface finishes and corresponding data, including roughness and film thickness. The composite roughness, a, is given in microns. The film thickness ratio, X, is the ratio of the average film thickness ha divided by the composite roughness. The contact load ratio, Wc, is the ratio of asperity contact load to total load. The maximum dimensionless pressure is calculated as P/Ph, where Ph is the maximum Hertzian pressure. It can be readily seen that the lower the overall composite roughness, or arithmetic mean roughness, the higher the film thickness ratio, X. Accordingly, a lower maximum pressure ratio and a lower maximum substrate shear stress is observed, as well as reduced contact load ratio an coefficients of friction. The smooth surface represents the ideal case and is for comparison. When the surface is ideally smooth, it has a calculated coefficient of friction of 0.02679, and there is little of any lubrication present because the surface is too smooth. Retention of sufficient lubrication on the gear surface is necessary for optimal gear wear. In contrast, when it is too rough, not enough lubrication is present, and increased surface peak interaction results. The result is greater lubrication of the gears, which corresponds to numerous benefits known to those skilled in the art including reduced stress on the gear and extended time to failure caused by fatigue. For example, gear fatigue life can be significantly improved from 11-12 hours before polishing to greater then 100 hours after polishing.<br>
Accordingly, the optimum gear surface finish is between approximately 5 micro-inches and 10 micro-inches Ra.. When surface roughness is reduced to between approximately 5 micro-inches Ra to 10 micro-inches Ra, the maximum<br>
5<br><br>
contact stress can be reduced more than fifty percent (50%). Similarly, the subsurface shear stress can be reduced by approximately thirty percent (30%) to fifty percent (50%).<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective of a surface with traditional nobbed and shaved surface finish. In the figure, Ra is the arithmetic mean roughness, Rq is the root mean square of the roughness, or a, and Rz is the maximum peak to valley measurement. The Ra is approximately 0.6988 urn, or approximately 25.5 micro-inches, and Rq is approximately 0.8864  m, or approximately 34.9 micro-inches.<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective of a surface following physicochemical polishing. Here, following treatment to polish the surface of me gear teeth, the Ra is approximately 0.1987  m, or approximately 7.82 micro-inches, and Rq is approximately 0.304  m, or approximately 11.97 micro-inches.<br>
The result of polishing the surface of the gear is an enhanced surface with reduced surface irregularities.<br>
6<br><br><br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, a gear surface is finished, or polished, to between approximately 5 micro-inches Ra and 1 0 micro-inches Ra. Any metal gear can be used and the surface to be finished or polished is preferably the gear functional surface. The gear functional surface is also known as the surface of the gear teeth that contact gear teeth of another gear. Any gear size is suitable, including transmission gears having approximately 3 to approximately 8 teeth per inch diameter to gears greater than 8-10 teeth per inch diameter. Additionally, the finished or polished surface topgraphy can be isotropic or non-isotropic.<br>
While advantageous embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. For example, the gear can be finished or polished using any known method, for example, electrochemical polishing, mechanical super finishing, mechanical abrasive polishing, and chemically accelerated vibratory polishing. The actual polishing or finishing used does not matter so long as the finish is relatively uniform and between approximately 5 to approximately 10 micro-inches. Additionally, it is preferable that the finishing or polishing process does not negatively effect the geometric shape and function of the gear teeth.<br>
