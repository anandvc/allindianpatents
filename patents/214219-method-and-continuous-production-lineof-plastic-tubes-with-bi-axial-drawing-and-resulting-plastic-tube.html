COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"METHOD AND CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION LINE OF PLASTIC TUBES WITH BIÂ¬AXIAL DRAWING AND RESULTING PLASTIC TUBE"<br>
ALPHACAN, a French company of 12/18, avenue de la Jonchere Elysee 2, F-78170 La Celle Saint Cloud, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
PROCESS AND LINE FOR THE CONTINUOUS MANUFACTURE<br>
OF PLASTIC PIPES WITH BIAXIAL DRAWING, AND<br>
PLASTIC PIPE OBTAINED<br>
The invention relates to a process for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing', in which a tube blank is formed by extrusion and then subjected to combined axial pulling and' radial expansion.<br>
FR-A-2 753 648 relates to a process of this type, especially for relatively large diameter pipes, in particular for diameters greater than 150 mm. This process, which is satisfactory, is however a batch process. In certain cases, especially for smaller pipe diameters, it is desirable for the process to be continuous so as to further improve the productivity and to reduce the investment cost per unit produced.<br>
Continuous manufacture of a pipe with biaxial drawing poses a problem as regards performing the radial expansion of the pipe in one region of the manufacturing line. Furthermore, the startup phase of the process is tricky.<br>
FR-A-2 207 793 discloses a process for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing, in which the radial expansion is performed with the aid of a frustoconical mandrel. Means for pulling on the pipe are provided downstream and upstream of this mandrel. The large base of the frustoconical mandrel is extended by a cylinder of the same diameter, which penetrates a sizing device. The external diameter of the large base of the truncated cone and of the cylinder which extends it determine the inside.diameter of the finished pipe.<br>
WO 95/25626  relates  to  a  continuous  manufacturing process of the same kind as the one above,  with a<br><br>
mandrel for the radial expansion, the diameter of the large base of the mandrel defining the inside diameter of the finished pipe. Means for pushing the tube blank are provided upstream of the mandrel, while a haul-off    is provided downstream of the mandrel.<br>
The use of a mandrel simplifies the line startup operation, especially as regards the radial expansion. The tube blank matches the frustoconical outer surface   of the mandrel and thus undergoes a relatively well controlled expansion. However, the friction forces are relatively high.<br>
Rumanian patent No. 80960 shows a mandrel of increasing diameter having a section in the form of a cross, the arms of which are provided at their ends with castors. A plastic pipe undergoes a radial expansion on this mandrel, followed by a radial contraction. The cross shape of the cross-section of the mandrel means that the external surface of the mandrel is not continuous, which may produce marks on the pipe and cause variable and uncontrolled drawing around the same circumference.<br>
WO 90/02644 relates to a process in which the radial expansion of the pipe is obtained by internal hydraulic pressure exerted in a chamber closed upstream by a first plug corresponding to the inside diameter of the tube blank and, downstream of a sizing device, by another plug which can be inflated by the effect of pressure. This plug, when not inflated, makes it possible to start up the line with an initial diameter and then, by inflating it, to reach the nominal inside diameter of the finished pipe.<br>
WO 97/06940 also uses an inflatable downstream plug and provides a means of controlling the expansion of the pipe in response to various parameters which indicate, directly or indirectly,  a variation in the relative<br><br><br>
speed at which the material is delivered into the expansion region and extracted from this region. The expansion is performed by hydraulic pressure in a chamber which is closed by the inflatable plug and a conventional upstream plug.<br>
The use of an inflatable plug in contact with a plastic pipe at a relatively high temperature poses problems as regards the choice of material for this plug. This is because it is necessary for the material to have sufficient elasticity to allow the plug to be inflated, while being resistant to the temperature and to the friction which are imposed by the plastic pipe. Furthermore, to achieve satisfactory sealing without causing excessively high friction between the plug and the internal surface of the pipe, it is difficult to adjust the internal pressure on the inflatable plug.<br>
A first object of the invention is, above all, to provide a process for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing which allows simple startup, by avoiding the problems posed by an inflatable plug, and which makes it possible to reduce the friction forces to which the pipe is subjected in the steady manufacturing state.<br>
To achieve this object, according to a first arrangement of the invention, the process for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing consists in producing a tube blank by extrusion, in taking this tube blank to the molecular orientation temperature, in making this tube blank pass around a radial expansion mandrel and in sizing and cooling the tube blank while subjecting it to an axial pulling force, and is characterized in that:<br>
the radial expansion performed on the mandrel is partial so that the inside diameter of the tube blank, when it leaves the mandrel, is smaller than the<br><br>
nominal inside diameter of the finished pipe,<br>
and a further radial expansion of the tube blank, up to its nominal diameter, is performed by internal fluid pressure,<br>
the whole being such that, in the steady operating state, the internal surface of the tube blank is no longer in contact with the mandrel.<br>
Advantageously, a chamber closed upstream and downstream of the mandrel is produced with the aid of at least an upstream plug and a downstream plug, each plug ensuring sealing, for example by comprising at least one disk made of a material sufficiently flexible for it to be able to flex and straighten in order to ensure sealing.<br>
Advantageously, the downstream sealing plug of greater diameter than the upstream plug is introduced thanks to the initial expansion on the mandrel, thus allowing a sealed volume to be generated.<br>
The pressurized fluid for the further expansion of the tube blank is admitted between the two sealing plugs.<br>
A second object of the invention, which may be taken into consideration independently or in combination with the first object, is to provide a process for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing which produces a practically constant axial elongation of the plastic.<br>
To achieve this other objective, according to a second arrangement of the invention, which may be implemented independently or in combination with the previous arrangement, the process for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing consists in producing a tube blank by extrusion, in taking this tube blank to the molecular orientation temperature, in<br><br><br>
radially expanding the tube blank, with sizing and cooling, while subjecting the tube blank to an axial pulling force, this process being characterized in that the friction force exerted on the tube blank and the pipe is detected and in that at least one operating parameter is acted upon in order to keep this friction force approximately constant.<br>
Such regulation produces a constant axial orientation (axial  elongation),  resulting in the  finished pipe having  a  constant  thickness  and  constant  physical properties.<br>
The friction force may be detected by measuring the pulling force exerted on the pipe. The operating parameter acted upon in order to keep the friction force approximately constant may consist of the internal pressure in the pipe and/or of a partial vacuum created around the pipe in a sizing device. According to another possibility, the friction force is regulated by injecting a lubricating fluid, especially water, between the pipe and the wall of the sizing device.<br>
The above regulation may be combined with upstream regulation designed to keep the characteristics of the tube blank constant.<br>
To do this, the characteristics of the tube blank, in particular the thickness and diameter of the tube blank, are measured and, in response to the results of the measurements, the extruder is acted upon in order to keep the characteristics of the tube blank constant.<br>
According to the first or the second arrangement, the pulling force on the pipe is advantageously exerted at a single point, downstream of a sizing region, by at least one haul-off.<br><br>
The invention also relates to a line for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing, for implementing the first process arrangement, comprising:<br>
an extruder conventionally equipped for forming a tube blank;<br>
at least one tank for raising the tube blank to the molecular orientation temperature;<br>
a device for the progressive radial expansion of the tube blank, comprising an expansion mandrel kept stationary relative to the extruder;<br>
a sizing device and a device for cooling the pipe,<br>
the manufacturing line being characterized in that the mandrel has a maximum diameter smaller than the nominal inside diameter of the pipe, in that a plug is located upstream of the mandrel, in that at least one other plug is located downstream of the mandrel, in order to produce a seal depending on the nominal inside diameter of the pipe, and in that a pressurized-f luid admission means is provided at a point located between the two sealing plugs, in order to admit pressurized fluid and to expand the pipe to its nominal inside diameter.<br>
In such a manufacturing line, in the steady state, the pipe is no longer in contact, via its internal wall, with the mandrel.<br>
Advantageously, a coaxial tube is fixed to the extruder and the mandrel is fixed to the end of this tube which has a channel emerging radially via at least one opening, between the two sealing plugs, for injecting pressurized fluid.<br>
Advantageously, the biaxial orientation part of the manufacturing line includes means for pulling on the pipe,  particularly  a  haul-off,  at  a  single  point<br><br>
located downstream of the sizing device and of the cooling device.<br>
The downstream, plug may be located downstream of the cooling tanks and be attached to the mandrel by a flexible linking element, especially a cable.<br>
As a variant, the downstream plug is located immediately behind the mandrel, thereby reducing the size of the sealed volume.<br>
The mandrel has an axisymmetric, for example frustoconical, overall shape, the large base of which faces the opposite side from the extruder; advantageously, the mandrel is provided, on its surface, with rolling members distributed angularly and axially so as to avoid marking the internal surface of the pipe and to reduce the friction forces.<br>
The rolling members preferably consist of cylindrical or spherical rollers mounted so as to rotate.<br>
Advantageously, the final tank for raising ' the temperature and/or the sizing device are mounted so as to be able to be moved one with respect to the other, in axial translation, especially to change their separation, and make it easier to start up the manufacture.<br>
The invention also relates to a line for the continuous manufacture of plastic pipes with biaxial drawing which, independently of the above features or in combination with these features, comprises:<br>
an extruder conventionally equipped for forming a tube blank;<br>
at least one tank for raising the tube blank to the molecular orientation temperature;<br>
a device for radially expanding the tube blank<br><br><br><br>
by internal fluid pressure;<br>
a sizing device and a device for cooling the pipe ;<br>
means for pulling the tube blank axially; this manufacturing line being characterized in that it includes means for detecting the friction force exerted on the tube blank and the pipe, and means for acting upon at least one operating parameter of the manufacturing line in order to keep this friction force approximately constant.<br>
Advantageously, the means for pulling on the tube are located at a single point, downstream of a sizing region, and comprise at least one  haul-off.<br>
The friction force may be detected by means for measuring the pulling force exerted on the pipe.<br>
Advantageously, means for measuring the characteristics of the tube blank, in particular the thickness and diameter of the tube blank, are provided and means for acting upon the extruder in response to the results of the measurements, in order to keep the characteristics of the tube blank constant.<br>
The invention also relates to a biaxially drawn plastic pipe obtained by the process and/or the manufacturing line described above.<br>
The invention consists, apart from the arrangements presented above, of a number of other arrangements which will be explained in more detail below in regard to illustrative examples described in detail with reference to the drawings appended hereto, but which are in no way limiting.<br>

Figure 8 is a view, on the line VIII-VIII in figure 7, of one element of the mandrel.<br>
Figure 9 is a top view of the mandrel element of figure 8.<br>
Finally, figure 10 is a side view of an illustrative example of an upstream plug.<br>
In the drawings, especially figure 1, may be seen a manufacturing line 1 employing the process of the invention. The production is carried out continuously from the upstream end (to the left in figure 1) to the<br><br>
downstream end (toward the right in figure 1).<br>
The manufacturing line comprises, shown schematically, an extruder 2 fed with thermoplastic, especially PVC, from a hopper 3 shown schematically (dry-blend feed). The extruder 2 is provided at its front end, on the opposite side from the hopper 3, with tooling 4 for extruding a pipe tube blank E. The tooling 4 includes one or more lateral inlets 5 for admitting and/or discharging pressurized air, or more generally a pressurized fluid (gas or liquid). Furthermore, a sizing die (not shown) is conventionally provided.<br>
A coaxial metal tube 6 is fixed to the extruder 2 and extends toward the right in figure 1. This tube 6 has, toward its closed axial end, at least one radial opening 7. When pressurized air is admitted via the inlet 5, this air is directed by channels (not shown) from the tooling 4 into the tube 6, to leave via the opening 7.<br>
A pipe  tube blank E  leaves  the  extruder 2  at  a relatively high temperature of around 150Â°C or more and passes through one or more cooling tanks 8, generally containing water,  which are thermally regulated for example to 10-20Â°C in order to substantially lower the temperature  of  the  tube  blank  E.  A  conventional haul-off (not shown) is generally provided downstream of the cooling tanks 8. This haul-off, which acts upon a tube blank when still hot, and therefore deformable, is not actually used to transfer thrust forces but only to  decouple  the  extrusion  and  biaxial  drawing functions, by damping the perturbations and interaction of one on the other.<br>
The biaxial orientation part of the tube blank starts downstream of the haul-off (not shown) of the extrusion part.  This  biaxial  orientation  part  comprises  a<br><br><br>
thermally regulated tank 9, for cooling or heating, in order to raise the tube blank E to a temperature lying within the range of molecular orientation temperatures. For PVC, this temperature lies within a range from 90Â°C to 110oC.<br>
Fixed to the outlet of the tank 9 is a ring 10 for externally pressing the tube blank onto an internal plug 11 upstream, shown in figures 2 to . 6. This internal plug 11 is located upstream of orifice 7.<br>
As may be seen in figure 10, the internal plug 11 may comprise, from the upstream end to the downstream end, a  succession  of  sealing  rings,   especially  two relatively flexible rings 11a, 11b, for example made of an elastomer, the periphery of which is formed by a frustoconical lip whose large base faces downstream. Several disks 11c, 11d, 11c, 11f, for example made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), spaced apart, parallel to one another and perpendicular to the axis of the tube blank, are provided downstream of these rings 11a, 11b. The outside diameter of the rings and of the disks is at least equal to the inside diameter of the tube blank E.<br>
The succession of rings and disks lla-llf forms a stack held by a metal core llg locked together, so as to be able to be adjusted along the axial direction, by nuts llh, 11i screwed on to the tube 6 consisting of a hollow threaded rod.<br>
The example of the plug 11 described in detail above is not limiting, any possible equivalent sealing means being suitable.<br>
A radial expansion mandrel 12, which' can be seen in figure 2, is fixed, under conditions explained below, to that end of the tube 6 on the opposite side from the<br><br><br>
extruder 2. The mandrel 12 has an axisymmetric overall shape and consists, for example, of a truncated cone. The large base 12a of the mandrel faces downstream. The diameter B of the large base 12a is' smaller than the nominal inside diameter D (figure 4) of the finished pipe T.<br>
Preferably,  the diameter B is at least 10% smaller than the diameter D.<br>
As illustrated in figure 7, the mandrel 12 is advantageously provided on its surface with cylindrical or spherical rollers 13, mounted so as to rotate on spindles (not visible) carried by the mandrel 12. The rollers 13 are partly housed in cavities on the surface of the mandrel and project from this surface. The axes of rotation of the rollers 13 lie in several parallel planes, perpendicular to the axis of the mandrel 12. The rollers 13, lying in the same plane, are uniformly distributed around the axis of the mandrel. The rollers lying in successive planes are offset in a staggered  fashion so as to prevent any generatrix of the mandrel 12 being devoid of a roller.<br>
Advantageously, the mandrel 12 consists of a frustoconical stack of disks 14 having diameters which increase from the upstream end to the downstream end. Each disk has rollers 13 uniformly distributed on its periphery in the manner of a crown. The disks 14 have a central opening 15 with one or more recesses 16 for mounting on a shaft 17, of conjugate section, so as to be prevented from rotating. An axial stop 18 is provided on the shaft 17 in order to retain the smallest diameter disk. On the opposite side, the shaft 17 has a thread 19 allowing the stack of disks 14 to be locked with the aid of a nut engaging with this thread.<br>
The mandrel 12 may thus be adjusted to various inside<br><br>
diameters of tube blanks by adding or removing disks 14 of appropriate diameters.<br>
The cylindrical or spherical rotating rollers 13 allow the friction of the tube blank on the mandrel to be considerably reduced and prevent marks on the internal surface of the pipe.<br>
A coaxial plug 2 0 is fixed to the mandrel 12 on the same side as the large base 12a, on the opposite side from the tube 6. This plug 20 is, for example, formed by at least one, and preferably several, disks 21 spaced apart, parallel to one another, which are made of a plastic having a low coefficient of friction, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) , which may or may not be reinforced. The disks 21 are made of a material sufficiently flexible to be able to flex and straighten in order to ensure sealing. The plug 2 0 is designed to ensure sealing at least along a diameter equal to the diameter B of the large base of the truncated cone 12. Other explanations on this subject will be given with regard to the variant in figure 6.<br>
A flexible linking member 22, for example a cable, is furthermore attached to the center of the mandrel 12 on the opposite side from the tube 6. The plug 20 may be installed on that part of the cable 22 close to the mandrel 12.<br>
Downstream of the mandrel 12, the tube blank enters a sizing device 23 (shown schematically). This sizing device 23 is placed in a water-spray vacuum cooling tank 24. The spraying of water on the external surface of the plastic pipe leaving the sizing device 23 allows the material to solidify. On leaving the tank 24, the pipe T in the finished state passes into a haul-off 25 which exerts the necessary pulling force on the entire<br><br>
line in order to haul the pipe and the tube blank. The haul-off 25 conventionally consists of two caterpillar tracks 26, 27 bearing against opposed regions of the pipe in order to haul it from the left to the right in figure 1. Each caterpillar track has a flexible element 28 forming an endless loop wrapped around wheels 29, at least one of which is driven, these wheels 29 being mounted so as to rotate about spindles 3 0 supported by a stand 31 fixed to the ground.<br>
The pulling force exerted by the haul-off 25 is detected by a sensor 32 (figure 1) , for example at the point where a spindle 30 is mounted on the stand 31.<br>
The output of the sensor 32 (figure 1) is connected to a unit 33, allowing the degree of vacuum in the tank 24 to be adjusted in response to the output signal from the sensor 32, and to a unit 34 allowing the pressure of the air delivered by the orifice 7 to be adjusted.<br>
The unit 33 may, if necessary, cause water to be injected with the aim of reducing the friction between the pipe and sizing device 23 if the force measured by the sensor 32 is too high.<br>
A sensor j is advantageously provided at the exit of the extruder 2 in order to measure the diameter of the tube  blank.  Several  other  sensors  h,  for  example ultrasonic   sensors,   are   distributed  around  the periphery of the tube blank, close to the exit of the extruder 2, in order to measure the thickness of this tube blank. The sensors j and h are connected to a control unit K suitable for acting upon the operating parameters of the extruder 2  in order to keep the dimensions of the tube blank,  at  the exit of the extruder 2, as constant as possible according to the values measured by the sensors j and h.<br><br>
The tank 24 and the sizing device 23 are mounted so as to be adjustable in the axial direction, as is the tank 9. These elements are mounted so as to move in translation, for example on rails fixed to the ground (not shown in the drawing) , with means for blocking in a desired position.<br>
The distance L between the downstream face of the tank 9 and the upstream face of the tank 24 is thus adjustable.<br>
In the steady operating state, a downstream plug 35 (figure 4) fastened to the cable 22 bears in a sealed manner against the internal surface of the pipe T. The plug 35 may consist of disks 36 which are spaced apart, parallel to one another and perpendicular to the axis of the tube and are made of a material such as PTFE or a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), which may or may not be reinforced. The plug 35 is designed to provide sealing along the inside diameter D of the finished pipe.<br>
From the foregoing description, it is apparent that the manufacturing line is composed of two different parts, with the minimum of interactions:<br>
a tube blank extrusion part consisting of a conventional extrusion line (extruder 2, tooling 4, sizing die, not shown, cooling tanks 8, haul-off, not shown);<br>
a  tube  blank biaxial  orientation  part  with tanks  9  for bringing  it  to  temperature,  expansion device (12; 6, 7, 11, 20, 35, 20a), sizing device 23, cooling device 24, haul-off 25 and saw (not shown).<br>
This being the case, the operation of the manufacturing line, employing the process of the invention, is as follows.<br><br><br>
The line startup is illustrated by figures 1 to 4.<br>
According to figure 1, a tube blank E leaves the extruder 2, in a relatively pasty state, and travels right down the line. To ensure this travel down the line, an auxiliary pulling tube may be used which is introduced from the downstream end, upstream into the line until coming close to the exit of the extruder; the tube blank is attached by any suitable means to this pulling tube which, hauled by the haul-off 25, hauls the tube blank itself through the tanks 8, 9 and 24.<br>
The radial expansion mandrel 12 is not yet installed (figure 1) and there is no pressurized air injection via the inlet 5 and the outlet orifice 7. The tank 9 is set back upstream, while the tank 24 is advanced downstream so that the distance L is the maximum.<br>
The mandrel 12 and the plug 20 are then fitted. To do this, a slit is made along a generatrix in the wall of the tube blank in a region lying between the tank 9 and the tank 24. The edges of the slit are moved apart in order to fit, downstream of the orifice 7, the plug 11 as illustrated in figure 2.  The mandrel 12 is then fixed  to  the  end  of  the  tube  6,  for  example by screwing,  and the cable 22 is introduced along the entire length of the tube blank so as to be able to recover the end of this cable downstream of the tank or tanks 24  for cooling  the biaxially oriented pipe, optionally cutting off,  using a saw  (not shown),  a downstream part of the tube blank.<br>
With material continuing to arrive, the slit made in the tube blank, for fitting the plug 11 and the mandrel 12, moves downstream and disappears. At this moment, the tube blank undergoes its first expansion in contact with the mandrel 12  (figure 2) .  There is still no<br><br><br>
injection of pressurized air via the orifice 7.<br>
When the tube blank has been correctly closed off downstream of the mandrel 12, the tank 9 is moved downstream, as illustrated by an arrow in figure 3, so that the ring 10 is placed around the plug 11. Air is then injected via the inlet 5 and the orifice 7, with a gradual rise in the pressure so that the tube blank separates slightly from the mandrel 12, as illustrated in figure 3.<br>
With increasing air pressure, the tube blank moves completely away from the mandrel 12, as illustrated in figure 4, and comes into contact with the sizing device 23. The inside diameter of the pipe then reaches its nominal value D greater than the diameter B of the large base of the mandrel 12.<br>
The downstream plug 35 is fitted to the end of the cable downstream of the cooling tank or tanks 24 and thus provides further sealing.<br>
As a variant, it defines with the downstream plug 20 a chamber in which air pressure provides, after the sizing device, the additional cooling of the formed pipe.<br>
When the steady state has been established, the tank 24 is moved toward the tank 9, as illustrated by an arrow in figure 5, in order to reduce the space between these two tanks and increase the distance between the internal surface of the tube blank and the mandrel 12.<br>
Preferably, a pulling force is exerted on the tube only downstream of the tank 24. The value of the pulling force measured by the sensor 32 (figure 1) constitutes a measurement of the friction of the tube blank and of the pipe in the line, particularly in the sizing device<br><br><br>
23.	The regulating effected on the basis of this force<br>
measurement by the sensor 32 makes it possible to work<br>
with a pulling force, and therefore a friction force,<br>
which is approximately constant, thereby corresponding<br>
to an approximately constant axial orientation (axial<br>
elongation) of the material of the pipe T.<br>
The friction force is kept approximately constant by the unit 34 (figure 1) which acts upon the internal pressure, in the tube blank and in the pipe, according to the value detected by the sensor 32. It is also possible to act upon the degree of vacuum in the tank<br>
24,	around the pipe, or by injecting lubricating water<br>
between the pipe and the internal wall of the sizing<br>
device 23.<br>
This regulation is effective if the dimensional characteristics of the tube blank are constant. To improve the manufacture, provision may be made to also regulate the tube blank leaving the extruder 2 with the aid of sensors j and h (figure 1) which, via the values detected, allow the unit K to change the operating conditions of the extruder 2 in order to keep the dimensional characteristics of the tube blank approximately constant.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the  downstream plugs  20  and  3 5  of  the previous embodiment now form only a single plug 20a located immediately downstream of the mandrel 12. This plug 20a also  preferably  consists  of  parallel  disks  21a, perpendicular to the axis of the tube. The disks must be flexible enough to be able to flex and, in a first step ensure sealing along the diameter B corresponding to the large base of the mandrel 12. The disks 21a of the plug 20a must be able, by dint of their elasticity, to straighten and then ensure sealing along the nominal inside diameter D of the pipe.<br><br>
The approach shown in figure 6 has the advantage that the closed chamber lying between the upstream plug 11 and the downstream plug 21a has a smaller volume. This results in lower inertia as regards pressure variations and temperature variations which may be controlled. Since  the volume of air stored is smaller, should a leak or an incident occur, the risks are also reduced.<br>
In  the  foregoing  description,  the  fluid  used  to generate the internal pressure in the tube blank is air.  Of course,  this  fluid could be a liquid,  in particular hot water. <br><br>
