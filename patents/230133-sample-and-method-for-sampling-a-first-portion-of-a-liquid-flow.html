				<td>This invention relates to a liquid sampler and a method for<br>
collecting a liquid sample, and to a diagnostic method <br>
comprising the collection of urine.<br>
It is well known that sampling urine can be an effective<br>
research and diagnosis tool to investigate an individual's<br>
physical condition.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The invention provides in a first aspect a liquid sampler and<br>
a method for sampling a liquid as defined in the appended<br>
independent claims. Preferred or advantageous features of the<br>
invention are set out in dependent sub-claims.<br>
As noted above, it is known to perform diagnostic tests on<br>
urine samples. In a second aspect of the invention, however,<br>
the inventor has appreciated that significant advantages can<br>
be achieved and new diagnostic tests implemented if a sample<br>
of only the first portion of the urine provided by an<br>
individual is tested or investigated. The first urine portion<br>
may be termed first-void urine.<br>
There is a problem, however, in isolating first-void urine<br>
without excessive dilution by the remainder of the contents of<br>
the patient's bladder.<br>
Thus, a preferred embodiment of the first aspect of the<br>
invention may advantageously provide a sampler for sampling a<br>
first portion of a liquid flow. The liquid flow enters at an<br>
inlet of the sampler. The sample passes from the inlet<br><br>
through a valve into a sample chamber and then the valve<br>
closes, diverting the remainder of the liquid flow to an<br>
overflow or exhaust passage. The valve comprises a valve<br>
inlet coupled to the sampler inlet, a valve outlet opening<br>
into the sample chamber and positioned, in use, substantially<br>
below the valve inlet, a shut-off chamber separating the valve<br>
outlet from the valve inlet, and a valve overflow leading out<br>
of the shut-off chamber. When the liquid level in the sample<br>
chamber rises to a predetermined level it disrupts the flow of<br>
liquid through the valve outlet and diverts later flow through<br>
the valve inlet into the shut-off chamber and through the<br>
valve overflow.<br>
A- further embodiment advantageously provides a first-void<br>
urine sampler which can be conveniently held by a user while<br>
they provide a urine specimen into a funnel, the sampler<br>
further comprising a valve which automatically directs a<br>
desired volume of first-void urine into a sample chamber and<br>
the remainder of the urine specimen to an exhaust passage for<br>
disposal.<br>
The urine sampler may thus enable the user to urinate<br>
continuously without the need for bladder control or the<br>
potentially messy option of moving a collection receptacle out<br>
of the urine stream.<br>
Advantageously, the valve provided within the sampler may seal<br>
the sample chamber after collection of the first portion of<br>
the liquid flow, or the first-void urine, until the sample<br>
chamber is removed from the sampler, even if the sampler is<br>
tilted or inverted with the sample chamber in place.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the sampler may advantageously<br>
collect the first 2ml to 5ml or 10ml of a liquid flow or a<br>
urine specimen, although the parameters of the sampler may be<br>
varied in order to collect different liquid volumes. The<br>
sample collected may also be diluted to a limited degree by<br>
liquid or urine delivered later in the liquid flow or the<br>
urine specimen. This dilution depends on the speed of<br>
operation and the effectiveness of the valve action of the<br>
sampler, and may depend on other parameters such as the rate<br>
of delivery of the liquid flow or the urine sample.<br>
Clearly, the sampler may find applications in sampling the<br>
first portion of any liquid flow. The technique is not<br>
limited to urine sampling.<br>
Whilst the invention is mainly directed to (and described with<br>
respect to) apparatus and methods suitable for sampling a<br>
first portion of a liquid flow (i.e. first-void urine), the<br>
apparatus and methods may be employed to collect one or more<br>
later samples after a first portion has been collected. Thus,<br>
the liquid from the overflow may be collected (all or in part)<br>
for any subsequent purpose irrespective of whether or not the<br>
first portion sample is desired or simply disposed of. When<br>
carrying out diagnostic testing of urine, first-void and<br>
later-void urine (e.g. mid-stream urine) may be collected and<br>
any or all samples may be tested.<br>
Description of Specific Embodiments and Best Mode<br>
Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described by<br>
way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which:<br><br>
Figure 1 is a three-quarter view of a urine sampler embodying<br>
the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a back view of the sampler of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a left side view of the sampler of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 4 is a front view of the sampler of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 5 is a plan view of the sampler of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 6 is a bottom view of the sampler of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 7 is a vertical section of the sampler of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 8 is a side view of a sampler substantially identical<br>
to that of Figure 1 showing the positions of transverse<br>
sections shown in Figures 9, 10 and 11; and<br>
Figures 12 to 26 are vertical sections of a central portion of<br>
the sampler of Figure 1 in various stages of urine collection.<br>
A preferred embodiment provides a urine sampler fabricated<br>
from plastic components, as shown in Figures 1 to 6 and in<br>
section in Figure 7. A substantially identical sampler,<br>
differing only in details of construction, is shown in figures<br>
8 to 11. The samplers of these embodiments are fabricated<br>
from machined acrylic. For mass production, it may be<br>
preferable to make the sampler by injection moulding and to<br>
use a different plastics material suitable for moulding.<br>
The dimensions of the sampler of the embodiment described<br>
below have been developed for the acrylic material. If the<br>
sampler is fabricated from a different material some<br><br>
modification of the sampler dimensions may be anticipated,<br>
particularly if the wetting properties of the material (for<br>
the liquid to be sampled) differ significantly from those of<br>
acrylic. The principles of operation of the sampler are<br>
materials independent, however, and only routine, non-<br>
inventive development within the capability of the person<br>
skilled in the art would be required to fabricate a sampler<br>
from a different material or for a different liquid in the<br>
light of the teaching herein.<br>
The sampler 2 comprises an upper portion 4, a valve portion 6<br>
and a sample chamber 8. The valve portion is a push fit onto<br>
the lower end of the upper portion, providing a liquid-tight<br>
seal, and is retained by a catch 10. The sample chamber is a<br>
push fit onto the valve portion, providing a liquid and<br>
air-tight seal. The catch ensures that the sample chamber can<br>
be removed without accidentally separating the upper and valve<br>
portions.<br>
The sampler of the embodiment is designed for use in a<br>
substantially vertical orientation, with the sample chamber at<br>
the bottom. The following text will describe it in this<br>
orientation.<br>
The upper end of the upper portion forms a funnel 12 for<br>
receiving urine. A handle 14 is provided for a user to hold<br>
the sampler while providing a urine specimen. Within the<br>
funnel, a baffle 16 is positioned to modulate the flow of<br>
urine and reduce turbulence at the funnel outlet 18. The<br>
handle, the baffle and a portion of the funnel may be. moulded<br>
as a separate component and fastened onto the remainder of the<br>
upper portion by means of a clip 19 for convenience of<br>
manufacture.<br><br>
The funnel outlet 18 drains into a first-catch reservoir 20<br>
within the upper portion of the sampler. The first-catch<br>
reservoir is substantially cylindrical except at its lower<br>
end, where a frusto-conical tapered section 22 links it to a<br>
substantially cylindrical valve inlet 24, which is preferably<br>
of circular cross-section. When a urine specimen enters the<br>
funnel, it drains into the first-catch reservoir and flows<br>
through the valve inlet, in a cylindrical stream out of the<br>
upper portion of the sampler. The flow rate is determined<br>
primarily by the cross-section and lengths of the valve inlet<br>
and the tapered section and the head of liquid in the<br>
first-catch reservoir.<br>
Below the level of the funnel outlet and at the upper end of<br>
the first-catch reservoir, a main overflow 26 leads to a<br>
vertical exhaust passage 28, which extends downwardly,<br>
substantially parallel to the first-catch reservoir and the<br>
valve inlet.<br>
When the upper portion of the sampler is secured to the valve<br>
portion, the valve inlet forms the uppermost component of a<br>
valve 30. The structure of the valve can be seen in the<br>
sectional views of Figures 7, 9, 10 and 11.<br>
At its lower end, the valve inlet leads into a shut-off<br>
chamber 32. This chamber is larger than the valve inlet in<br>
horizontal cross-section and its side walls are set back from<br>
the walls of the valve inlet, so as not to interfere with the<br>
flow of urine out of the valve inlet. The shut-off chamber<br>
extends horizontally to a shut-off chamber overflow 34, which<br>
drains into the exhaust 28.<br>
A tapered passage 38 extends downwardly from the shut-off<br>
chamber, leading to a narrower, substantially cylindrical<br><br>
valve outlet 36 which opens into the sample chamber. The<br>
valve outlet is aligned with the valve inlet and is preferably<br>
circular in section, having a slightly larger diameter than<br>
the valve inlet. Thus, in use, a urine stream from the valve<br>
inlet can initially pass through the shut-off chamber and the<br>
valve outlet without touching the walls of either the shut-off<br>
chamber or the valve outlet.<br>
The valve outlet is slightly offset to one side of the sample<br>
chamber. This allows space for a vent tube 4 0 which extends<br>
from within the sample chamber, upwardly through the shut-off<br>
chamber, and opens at its upper end 42 into a vent tube<br>
pocket 44. The lower end of the vent tube is blind but one or<br>
more vent holes 4 6 are defined in a side wall of the vent tube<br>
near its lower end. The holes preferably do not open either<br>
facing towards the centre of the sample chamber and the valve<br>
outlet or in the opposite direction towards the closest<br>
portion of the sample chamber wall, but open laterally, into<br>
or out of the plane of the section in figure 7. This reduces<br>
the risk of liquid-splashing in the sample chamber blocking<br>
the vent holes prematurely.<br>
The vent tube is moulded as part of the valve portion of the<br>
sampler and, when the sampler is assembled, its upper end<br>
enters the vent tube pocket, which is a moulded recess in the<br>
upper portion of the sampler. When the sampler is assembled,<br>
the vent tube pocket is connected to and extends upwardly from<br>
the shut-off chamber, the upper end of the vent tube extending<br>
into the pocket alongside the valve inlet 24.<br>
As shown in the transverse section of Figure 11, the vent tube<br>
need not be of circular section but is advantageously of an<br>
elongated or arcuate section to maximise the cross-sectional<br>
area of the vent while keeping it spaced from the valve outlet<br><br>
and the urine stream passing into the sample chamber. It is<br>
advantageous for the sample chamber to vent freely in order to<br>
allow the first-void urine to flow as quickly as possible into<br>
the sample chamber. This reduces the risk of first-void urine<br>
mixing with later portions of the urine specimen in the first-<br>
catch reservoir.<br>
Figures 12 to 26 illustrate the operation of the sampler of<br>
the embodiment during the collection of a first-void urine<br>
sample from a urine specimen. Each figure shows the sampler<br>
in cross-section, omitting its upper and lower ends in order<br>
to focus on the valve operation. Reference numerals<br>
identifying components of the sampler are shown in Figure 12<br>
but have been omitted from Figures 13 to 26 for clarity.<br>
Figure 13 shows a urine specimen 100 entering the funnel and<br>
draining between the funnel and the baffle into the first void<br>
chamber. Initially, the urine flows through the valve<br>
inlet 24 and passes as a cylindrical column, or jet, 102 into<br>
the sampler chamber. The diameter of the urine column, or •<br>
jet, 102 is determined primarily by the shape and size of the<br>
valve inlet and is arranged so that the column passes directly<br>
through the shut-off chamber and the valve outlet at this<br>
stage.<br>
The flow rate through the valve inlet is predetermined to be<br>
slower than the flow rate into the funnel and therefore, as<br>
shown in Figure 14, the level of liquid within the first void<br>
chamber 20, 22 above the valve inlet begins to rise as shown<br>
in Figures 14 to 16, until it reaches a level 104 just below<br>
the main overflow 26, as shown in Figure 16. During this<br>
time, the liquid level 106 in the sample chamber rises. After<br>
this point, as shown in Figure 17, urine 108 begins to flow<br><br>
into the main overflow and the exhaust 28, preventing the<br>
liquid level from rising further within the sampler.<br>
At about this stage, as shown in Figure 17, the liquid<br>
level 110 in the sample chamber rises to cover the vent<br>
holes 46 near the end of the vent tube 40. In Figure 17, this<br>
occurs at about the same time that the liquid in the<br>
first-catch reservoir overflows through the main overflow.<br>
This may not always be the case, however. For example, if the<br>
urine specimen is provided more rapidly, the first-catch<br>
reservoir will overflow before the liquid level in the sample<br>
chamber, covers the vent holes.<br>
While the sample chamber is filling, up to the point at which<br>
the vent holes are covered, the air displaced from the sample<br>
chamber by the liquid passes through the vent holes, along the<br>
vent tube, through the vent tube pocket and escapes through<br>
the shut-off chamber overflow. When the vent holes are<br>
covered, however, air can no longer escape along this route.<br>
The only escape route is then upwards through the valve outlet<br>
(alongside the column of urine entering the sample chamber)<br>
and through the shut-off chamber overflow. As the air in the<br>
sample chamber flows up the valve outlet, against the<br>
direction of flow of the urine, and the air pressure in the<br>
sample chamber rises, the column of urine is disturbed and<br>
bulges and touches the walls of the valve outlet. The initial<br>
bulging of the urine column is shown at 112 in Figure 17.<br>
When the urine column wets the valve outlet around its entire<br>
circumference, no further air can escape from the sample<br>
chamber. The combination of capillary attraction between the<br>
urine and the wall of the valve outlet and the increased air<br>
pressure in the sample chamber prevents further flow of<br>
urine 114 through the valve outlet, as shown in Figure 18.<br><br>
This effectively closes the valve 30. As shown in Figures 18<br>
to 20, no further urine enters the sample -chamber and the<br>
shut-off chamber is filled by urine flowing through the valve<br>
inlet from the first-catch reservoir. This liquid covers the<br>
lower end of the vent tube pocket, providing a further seal to<br>
prevent air leaving the sample chamber. As shown in<br>
Figure 20, this liquid 116 escapes through the shut-off<br>
chamber overflow. At the same time, if urine is still<br>
entering the funnel, any excess 118 at the top of the catch<br>
reservoir escapes through the main overflow.<br>
When delivery of the urine specimen into the funnel ceases, as<br>
shown in Figure 21 any liquid 120 above the main overflow<br>
drains through the main overflow while liquid in the<br>
first-catch reservoir and the shut-off chamber drains through<br>
the shut-off chamber overflow. This process continues as<br>
shown in Figures 22 to 25, until the first-catch reservoir and<br>
the shut-off chamber are empty. The final configuration of<br>
the sampler is shown in Figure 26, in which the desired sample<br>
is in the sample chamber and a small volume of urine 122<br>
remains in the valve outlet, held by capillary attraction.<br>
The sample chamber may then be detached from the remainder of<br>
the sampler, without dislodging the liquid 122 within the<br>
valve outlet, for analysis or other purposes.<br>
It can be seen that the urine sample in the sample chamber may<br>
advantageously contain a large proportion of first-void urine,<br>
subsequent parts of the specimen having been directed to the<br>
exhaust 28.<br>
It can also be seen that in the final configuration of the<br>
sampler, shown in Figure 26, the sample is securely held<br>
within the sample chamber even if the sampler is tilted or<br>
inverted. Once the valve outlet is blocked by capillary<br><br>
attraction and the vent holes are covered by the sample, the<br>
airlock within the sample chamber may advantageously prevent<br>
the sample from escaping either through the valve outlet or<br>
the vent tube.<br>
Features and functions of the sampler<br>
Funnel 12<br>
The angle of the funnel is selected to encourage efficient<br>
flow into the first-catch reservoir. If the funnel angle is<br>
too shallow, undesirable mixing of urine in the funnel may<br>
occur: However, if the funnel angle is too' steep, urine may<br>
be forced too quickly into the first-catch reservoir, causing<br>
turbulence and mixing in the reservoir.<br>
In the embodiment, the funnel angle, between two opposite<br>
walls of the funnel, is 40 degrees.<br>
Baffle 16<br>
The baffle should prevent urine jetting directly into the<br>
first-catch reservoir, which would cause mixing, or into the<br>
overflow, which would risk losing the first-void urine. The<br>
profile of the baffle should be selected to encourage<br>
tangential flow, rather than vertical flow, within the<br>
sampler, to reduce mixing and encourage flow into the main<br>
overflow when the first-catch reservoir has filled. This<br>
assists in achieving the object of the sampler, of collecting<br>
the first few millilitres of urine in the specimen.<br>
When a urine specimen first enters the sampler, it enters the<br>
first-catch reservoir and immediately begins to flow into the<br>
sample chamber. The valve inlet restricts the urine flow rate<br><br>
and so, as the sample chamber fills, the urine level in the<br>
first-catch reservoir rises. It is therefore desirable to<br>
limit mixing of urine in the first-catch reservoir, otherwise<br>
later portions of the urine specimen might mix with first-void<br>
urine at the lower end of the first-catch reservoir and enter<br>
the sample chamber, disadvantageously diluting the sample.<br>
The design of the baffle can help to reduce such mixing by<br>
encouraging horizontal, rather than vertical, flow directions<br>
within the sampler and especially within the first-catch<br>
reservoir. Advantageously, limiting vertical flow can lead to<br>
layering of the urine in the first-catch reservoir, with more<br>
concentrated first-void urine at the bottom, which will flow<br>
into the sample chamber, and urine containing a higher<br>
proportion of later parts of the urine specimen at the top.<br>
In the embodiment, the clearance between the baffle end and<br>
the inside of the funnel should be between 1.5mm and 3.0mm.<br>
Clearance less than 1.5mm tends to restrict flow and lead to<br>
urine collecting above the baffle, which disx-upts flow into<br>
the sampler. Clearance more than 3mm tends to lead to a risk<br>
of the urine specimen jetting directly into the main overflow<br>
or the first-catch reservoir.<br>
First-catch reservoir<br>
The reservoir traps the first-void urine however quickly the<br>
specimen is delivered and limits mixing with later portions of<br>
the specimen, which escape through the main overflow. In<br>
practice, about the first 1ml or 2ml of the sample enters the<br>
sample chamber rapidly, while the first-catch reservoir fills.<br>
If the desired sample size is, say, 4 ml, the balance of the<br>
sample is contained at that stage in the lower part of the<br>
first-catch reservoir, and drains progressively into the<br>
sample chamber. Figures 13 to 16 illustrate this process in<br><br>
the embodiment. When the first-catch reservoir fills, its<br>
upper part contains liquid which is not intended to form part<br>
of the sample but which, effectively forms a buffer to protect<br>
the liquid in the lower part of the first-catch reservoir from<br>
turbulence and mixing caused by further urine entering the<br>
sampler, and therefore helps to reduce dilution of the sample.<br>
This is a facet of the phenomenon of layering discussed above.<br>
Thus, the capacity of the first-catch reservoir should<br>
advantageously be greater than the desired sample volume minus<br>
the volume of the part of the sample which enters the sample<br>
chamber before the first-catch reservoir has filled plus the<br>
volume of the buffer liquid. In effect, for sample volumes of<br>
a few millilitres this means that the capacity of the<br>
first-catch reservoir advantageously approximately equals the<br>
desired sample volume to be collected.<br>
The diameter of the first-catch reservoir should be selected'<br>
to prevent or reduce mixing between urine at the bottom of the<br>
reservoir and urine higher in the reservoir, which may occur<br>
if the diameter is too large. (The issue of mixing and<br>
layering in the first-catch reservoir is also discussed above<br>
in relation to baffle design). However, if the first-catch<br>
reservoir diameter or volume is too small, then a portion of<br>
the first-void urine may be lost through the main overflow.<br>
As described above the first-catch reservoir preferably has a<br>
minimum volume to prevent dilution of the sample, but it is<br>
also desirable that its diameter or cross-section is not too<br>
large. There may therefore need to be a compromise between<br>
these dimensions in order to prevent the height of the first-<br>
catch reservoir, and therefore the height of the sampler,<br>
being undesirably large.<br><br>
In the embodiment, the diameter of the cylindrical portion of<br>
the reservoir is 10mm and its height is 50mm. This is<br>
appropriate for a 4ml sample volume. For different sample<br>
volumes of a few millilitres, the height or other dimensions<br>
of the first-catch reservoir may advantageously be varied so<br>
that the reservoir volume is about the same as the sample<br>
volume.<br>
First-catch reservoir, frusto-conical section 22<br>
This lower section of the first-catch reservoir, which may be<br>
termed the reservoir funnel, blends the diameter of the<br>
first-catch reservoir down to the diameter of the valve inlet.<br>
The angle of the reservoir funnel should be selected as<br>
follows. If the angle is too shallow, flow into the valve<br>
inlet may be inhibited. If the angle is too steep, it may<br>
encourage excessively rapid flow through the valve inlet. In<br>
the embodiment, the reservoir funnel is 10mm in length,<br>
blending from the 10mm diameter of the first-catch reservoir<br>
to the 3.2mm diameter of the valve inlet.<br>
Valve inlet<br>
In the embodiment, this is a circular cylinder of<br>
3.2 millimetre diameter.. This provides a focussed jet, or<br>
column, of urine, through the valve outlet into the sample<br>
chamber.<br>
The diameter of the valve inlet should not be too small, in<br>
which case the jet of urine it produces may puncture through<br>
the drop of urine in the valve outlet, which is held by<br>
capillary action and prevents further flow into the sample<br>
chamber after the sample has been collected.<br><br>
Tapered passage 38 leading to the valve outlet<br>
As described above, the urine column from the valve inlet<br>
initially passes through the valve outlet directly into the<br>
sample chamber. At this stage it is important that the urine<br>
flows freely into the sample chamber and so it is desirable to<br>
prevent the urine column from wetting the entire circumference<br>
of the valve outlet, which might cause formation of a plug of<br>
liquid held by capillary action in the valve outlet and<br>
prematurely disrupt or prevent further urine flow into the<br>
sample chamber.<br>
If the sampler is tilted during collection of a specimen, the<br>
urine column produced by the valve inlet may curve downwards.<br>
The provision of a tapered entrance to the valve outlet may<br>
increase the tolerance of the sampler to being tilted during<br>
use by reducing the chance or the extent of contact between<br>
the urine column and the circumference of the valve outlet or<br>
the floor of the shut-off chamber beside the valve outlet.<br>
Valve outlet 36<br>
The dimensions of the valve outlet may advantageously be<br>
selected in view of the following factors. Its diameter<br>
should be small enough to enable the collected sample in the<br>
sample chamber to remain sealed by the surface tension in the<br>
suspended urine drop, or plug, within the valve outlet. The<br>
tapered passage 38 leading into the valve outlet helps to cope<br>
with any irregularities in the urine stream exiting the valve<br>
inlet, which may arise due to turbulence or tilting of the<br>
sampler.<br>
A further factor is the relationship between the sizes and<br>
positions of the valve inlet and the valve outlet. In the<br><br>
embodiments described above the valve outlet is aligned with<br>
and of slightly larger diameter than the valve inlet. This is<br>
one way to achieve the functional requirements of this aspect<br>
of the sampler that the urine column from-the valve inlet<br>
should pass freely through the valve outlet until, at a<br>
predetermined liquid level in the sample chamber, the column<br>
is disrupted and a plug of liquid forms in the valve outlet,<br>
causing further urine to be diverted into the shut-off<br>
chamber. Thus, the valve outlet may be of any size or<br>
orientation as long as these functional requirements are met;<br>
it may, for example, be tilted relative to the valve inlet so<br>
that the urine initially strikes and flows along the wall on<br>
one side of the valve outlet into the sample chamber.<br>
In the embodiment, the valve outlet is a circular cylinder of<br>
4.2mm diameter and 8.5mm long. The tapered passage at its<br>
entrance is 3.5mm long and flares at an angle of 30 degrees.<br>
Vent holes 4 6<br>
Each vent hole should be sufficiently small that when the<br>
urine level in the sample chamber rises to cover the vent<br>
holes, the urine is prevented by surface tension from entering<br>
the vent tube. The cumulative cross-section of all of the<br>
vent holes (or slots) should be large enough to allow air to<br>
escape through the vent tube fast enough to allow the sample<br>
chamber to fill; it is desirable to allow the sample chamber<br>
to fill sufficiently quickly to prevent unnecessary mixing of<br>
the first-void urine in the first-catch reservoir with later<br>
portions of the urine specimen.<br>
It may be advantageous to use slot-shaped vent holes, rather<br>
than circular vent-holes for example, to increase air flow<br>
while reducing the minimum lateral dimension of the vent-holes<br><br>
and therefore making it easier for surface tension to block<br>
the vent-holes.<br>
In the embodiment, the maximum dimension for any one of the<br>
vent holes is 0.5mm, to prevent urine ingress into the vent<br>
tube, and the minimum total open area' of all of the vent holes<br>
is 0.8mm2, to provide sufficient air flow rate.<br>
Vent tube 40<br>
As described above, the lower end of the vent tube in the<br>
embodiment may be sealed and vent holes advantageously defined<br>
in the side of the. vent tube near its end and on the side of<br>
the vent tube facing neither the urine column entering the .<br>
sample chamber nor the wall of the sample chamber furthest<br>
from the entering urine column. When the urine enters the<br>
sample chamber, it tends to splash, rising particularly high<br>
adjacent the wall of the sample tube furthest from the valve<br>
outlet. This is driven by the tendency of the urine stream to<br>
rotate at the bottom of the sample tube, following the wall of<br>
the sample chamber. The positioning of the vent holes on the<br>
sides of the vent tube therefore helps to control unwanted or<br>
premature splashing of the vent holes.<br>
The upper end of the vent tube nests into the vent tube<br>
pocket. It should be noted that when the shut-off chamber<br>
floods after collection of the sample in the sample chamber,<br>
the lower end of the pocket is sealed by the presence of the<br>
urine, which helps to maintain the air pressure within the<br>
sample chamber, which in turn prevents further access of urine<br>
into the sample chamber.<br>
In the embodiment, the vent pocket wall is spaced from the<br>
vent tube by between 0.25mm and 0.5mm.<br><br>
Shut-off chamber 32<br>
The height of the shut-off chamber determines the distance<br>
between the valve inlet and the valve outlet, and so may<br>
affect the relationship between their diameters. The capacity<br>
of the shut-off chamber also affects how quickly and<br>
effectively the vent pocket is sealed after the sample is<br>
collected. Further, the height of the shut-off chamber<br>
affects the tolerance of the sampler to tilting during use,<br>
given that the urine stream leaving the valve inlet must pass<br>
through,the shut-off chamber and the valve outlet as described<br>
above. <br>
If the shut-off chamber volume is too large or its height is<br>
too great, then after urine stops flowing into the sample<br>
chamber and starts flowing into the shut-off chamber, it may<br>
take too long to reach and cover the vent-tube pocket. This<br>
may lead to unreliability as, until the vent-tube pocket is<br>
covere'd, the sealing of the sample chamber depends on the plug<br>
of liquid in the valve outlet and the capillary action sealing<br>
the vent holes. If the shut-off chamber volume is too small<br>
or its height too small, then if the urine column flowing from<br>
the valve inlet accidentally hits the edge of the valve outlet<br>
within the shut-off chamber, sufficient liquid may collect in<br>
the shut-off chamber to cover the vent-tube pocket and cause<br>
the valve to close prematurely. Again, this is a reliability<br>
issue, which may lead to inconsistent operation if, for<br>
example, the sampler is tilted or shaken excessively during<br>
urine collection.<br>
It will be appreciated that other features such as the tapered<br>
entrance passage of the valve outlet may also affect these<br>
aspects of the sampler's operation; the shape and size of the<br><br>
tapered passage influence the risk of the urine column hitting<br>
the floor of the shut-off chamber adjacent the edge of the<br>
valve outlet (or its tapered entrance passage) and prematurely ,<br>
deflecting liquid into the shut-off chamber.<br>
In the embodiment, the shut-off chamber is 3.5mm high and has<br>
a volume of approximately 320mm3.<br>
Shut-off chamber overflow 34<br>
This overflow allows urine from the shut-off chamber to escape<br>
to the ,exhaust passage. The cross-section of the overflow<br>
must not be too large, otherwise it will empty the shut-off<br>
chamber too quickly, which could break the seal provided by<br>
the urine in the shut-off chamber at the base of the vent<br>
pocket. If the shut-off chamber overflow is too small, it may<br>
not allow sufficient flow through the shut-off chamber to<br>
block the vent pocket quickly enough when the sample chamber<br>
is filled to the required level.<br>
In the embodiment, the shut-off chamber overflow is a circular<br>
cylindrical passage of diameter 2.4mm.<br>
Sampler characteristics<br>
The sampler of the embodiment is designed to collect a 2ml<br>
sample. It is designed to operate at urine flow rates between<br>
15ml and 30ml per second. For other applications, the sizes<br>
of the components of the sampler may be altered appropriately,<br>
for example to collect samples of 5ml or 10ml. It is<br>
desirable that the sample should be as pure as possible,<br>
ideally containing only the desired volume of first-void<br>
urine. Usually, however, some dilution of the sample with<br>
later portions of the urine specimen occurs due to mixing in<br><br>
the first-catch reservoir. Tests have, for example, achieved<br>
collection of 10ml samples in which each sample was collected<br>
from amongst the first 12ml of the (much larger) urine<br>
specimen.<br>
For reliable operation, it is important that the internal<br>
surfaces of the sampler are clean and dry because wetting of<br>
components such as the valve' outlet and the shut-off chamber<br>
should be predictable. In one embodiment, the sampler may be<br>
manufactured as a disposable item and kept in a sealed<br>
container before use, ensuring that it is clean and dry when<br>
used. If a sampler were to be reused, it may be important to<br>
be able to dismantle it for effective cleaning and drying.<br>
Further Embodiments<br>
In a simpler embodiment, the sample chamber is not provided<br>
with a vent-tube extending into the chamber, while the valve<br>
outlet is lengthened by a tubular portion extending into the<br>
sample chamber. While the sample chamber is filling, the<br>
liquid column from the valve inlet passes through the valve<br>
outlet and air from the chamber vents through the valve outlet<br>
alongside the liquid column. When the urine level in the<br>
sample chamber reaches the end of the urine valve outlet, no<br>
further air can escape and the liquid column in the valve<br>
outlet is disrupted, wetting the circumference of the valve<br>
outlet and forming a liquid plug. This closes the valve,<br>
diverting the urine flowing from the valve inlet into the<br>
shut-off chamber and through the shut-off chamber overflow.<br><br>
