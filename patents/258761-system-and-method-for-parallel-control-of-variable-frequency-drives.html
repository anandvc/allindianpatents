SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PARALLEL CONTROL<br>
OF VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the priority benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/708,066, filed on August 12,2005.<br>
BACKGROUND This application discloses an invention that is related, generally and in<br>
various embodiments, to a system and method for parallel control of variable frequency<br>
drives.<br>
 Variable frequency drives are known in the art. A variable frequency<br>
drive typically includes a control circuit and a power circuit. For synchronous motor<br>
applications, the variable frequency drive may also include a field supply. The control<br>
circuit controls the operation of the power circuit and, for synchronous motor<br>
applications, also enables/disables the associated field supply. The power circuit<br>
includes a rectifier and an inverter, and provides power to a winding of a motor<br>
connected to the variable frequency drive. For synchronous motor applications, the<br>
field supply provides power to an exciter for a motor field circuit.<br>
 The control circuit typically includes a speed regulator, a flux<br>
regulator, a magnetizing current regulator, a torque current regulator, a DQ-30<br>
transform, a pulse width modulator, and a motor model. The speed regulator provides a<br>
magnetizing current reference, and the flux regulator provides a torque current<br>
reference. The control circuit compares the magnetizing current reference to a<br>
measured magnetizing current, and the magnetizing current regulator determines a Q-<br>
axis voltage reference. The control circuit also compares the torque current reference<br><br>
to a measured torque current, and the torque current regulator determines a D-axis<br>
voltage reference. Additional feed-forward signals may be added to the D-axis voltage<br>
reference and the Q-axis voltage reference to provide a higher dynamic response. The<br>
DQ-30 transform transforms the Q-axis voltage reference and the D-axis voltage<br>
reference from two-phase information into three-phase values. The pulse width<br>
modulator converts the three-phase values to switching commands that are sent to the<br>
power circuit. The motor model generally utilizes measured voltage and/or current<br>
signals to determine motor parameters such as the motor speed, the motor flux, the<br>
motor flux angle. For applications where low cost is a business requirement, the motor<br>
model may only utilize the variable frequency drive output current or the motor current<br>
to determine motor parameters. The motor model also converts measured currents into<br>
a magnetizing current component and a torque current component for use in the<br>
magnetizing current regulator and the torque current regulator, respectively. Many of the functions performed by the control circuit are<br>
implemented in software. The software is written such that calculations are done at two<br>
or more different rates so as to save processor execution time. In general, the pulse<br>
width modulator operates at the fastest rate and is usually implemented in hardware.<br>
The magnetizing current regulator, the torque current regulator, and the DQ-3<br>
transform blocks are typically executed at a data rate of 1 - 10 kilohertz so that a fast<br>
response of the control is achieved in limiting the output current of the variable<br>
frequency drive in case of sudden changes in the load or the output circuit. The speed<br>
regulator and the flux regulator typically operate at a slower rate of 100 -1000 hertz<br>
because both motor speed and motor flux change at a much slower rate than the<br>
magnetizing current and the torque current. The motor model also is usually computed<br><br>
at this rate. Communications from the control circuit to the outside world, which<br>
includes communications to an external device (from the customer), is typically at a<br>
rate of 1 - 10 hertz.<br>
 When the power needed to be delivered to a load exceeds the power<br>
available from a single variable frequency drive, it is known to connect a number of<br>
variable frequency drives in parallel in order to meet the power requirement of the load.<br>
To control such parallel arrangements, a master-slave arrangement is often utilized. In<br>
a master-slave configuration, a master controller often operates as an interface between<br>
external controls (e.g., customer controls) and the various variable frequency drives.<br>
The respective control circuits communicate with the master controller and also<br>
communicate directly with each other.<br>
 In general, for the master-slave arrangement, one variable frequency<br>
drive is configured as the master drive, and the other variable frequency drives are<br>
configured as slave drives. The master drive typically performs the speed regulator<br>
function and the flux regulator function, and issues current commands (torque current<br>
reference and magnetizing current reference) to itself and all the slave drives. The<br>
slave drives operate on current commands from the master drive and do not utilize their<br>
respective speed regulators or flux regulators. Thus, the slave drives operate with<br>
fewer regulators than the master drive. The slave drives utilize the current commands<br>
from the master drive to regulate each of their output currents and produce the required<br>
motor voltage. In addition to the current commands, the master drive must also send<br>
either the motor flux angle or the motor frequency information to the slave drives to<br>
enable the slave drives to convert the respective Q-axis voltage references and D-axis<br>
reference voltages to the correct 3-phase reference frame. To provide good dynamic<br><br>
performance, the required communication rate between the master drive and the slave<br>
drives is in the range of 100 - 1000 hertz. The master controller is required to have<br>
knowledge of the master drive so that a slave drive can be configured as the new master<br>
drive in case the original master drive needs to be removed from the system.<br>
 For proper operation, each variable frequency drive is required to<br>
know its position in the system (either master or slave) and is required to operate<br>
differently based on its position. As the master drive performs more tasks than the<br>
slave drives, the control of the master drive is more complex than the control of the<br>
slave drives. Although the master-slave configuration works well for a number of<br>
different applications; the master-slave configuration tends to be relatively complex and<br>
relatively expensive to implement<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one general respect, this application discloses a system for parallel<br>
control of variable frequency drives. According to various embodiments, the system<br>
comprises a master controller, and at least two independent variable frequency drives in<br>
communication with the master controller. Each variable frequency drive comprises a<br>
power circuit, and a controller in communication with the power circuit. The controller<br>
comprises a speed droop module and a flux share module. The speed droop module is<br>
structured and arranged to regulate a torque current component in the variable<br>
frequency drive. The flux share module is structured and arranged to regulate a<br>
magnetizing current component in the variable frequency drive.<br>
 In another general respect, this application discloses a method for<br>

based on measurements of a stator voltage and current of a motor coupled to the<br>
variable frequency drive, determining a speed reference based on a torque current<br>
component value, and determining a flux reference based on the magnetizing current<br>
component value and the average magnetizing current component value. The method<br>
further comprises adjusting a torque current component based on the speed reference<br>
and/or adjusting a magnetizing current component based on the flux reference.<br>
 Aspects of the invention may be implemented by a computing device<br>
and/or a computer program stored on a computer-readable medium. The computer-<br>
readable medium may comprise a disk, a device, and/or a propagated signal.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 It is to be understood that at least some of the figures and descriptions<br>
of the invention have been simplified to focus on elements that are relevant for a clear<br>
understanding of the invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other<br>
elements that those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate may also comprise a<br>
portion of the invention. However, because such elements are well known in the art,<br>
and because they do not necessarily facilitate a better understanding of the invention, a<br>
description of such elements is not provided herein.<br>
 Figure 1 illustrates various embodiments of a system 10 for parallel<br>
control of variable frequency drives. The system 10 comprises a master controller 12,<br>
and independent variable frequency drives 14 in communication with the master<br>
controller 12. Although only two variable frequency drives 14 are shown in Figure 1,<br>
one skilled in the art will appreciate that the system 10 may comprise any number of<br>
variable frequency drives 14.<br>
 The master controller 12 may be embodied as one or more<br>
programmable logic controllers, and may serve as the interface between other controls<br>
(e.g., customer controls) and the variable frequency drives 14. The master controller 12<br>
is structured and arranged to communicate with the variable frequency drives 14 at a<br>
data rate that is substantially less than any computation rate within the variable<br>
frequency drives 14. As described in more detail hereinbelow, satisfactory current<br>
sharing between the variable frequency drives 14 may be realized with a data<br>
communication rate on the order of approximately 1-10 hertz, which is substantially<br><br>
less than any computation rate within the variable frequency drives 14. The master<br>
controller 12 may send commands such as speed and flux demands and start or stop<br>
requests to each of the variable frequency drives 14. Responsive thereto, each variable<br>
frequency drive 14 may send status information (e.g., healthy or faulted) and feedback<br>
information (e.g., output current, voltage and frequency) to the master controller 12.<br>
 Each variable frequency drive 14 comprises a controller 16 in<br>
communication with the master controller 12, and a power circuit 18 in communication<br>
with the controller 16. Each power circuit 18 is coupled to a winding of a motor 20.<br>
According to various embodiments, each power circuit 18 may be coupled to a different<br>
winding of a multi-winding alternating current motor, to the same winding of a single<br>
winding alternating current motor, or any combination thereof. One skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that the system 10 may be utilized with any type of alternating current<br>
motor such as a synchronous motor, an induction motor, or a permanent magnet motor.<br>
For synchronous motor applications, each variable frequency drive 14 may also include<br>
a field supply that is enabled/disabled by the controller 16, and each field supply may<br>
be connected to an exciter for a motor field circuit as is known in the art. As shown in<br>
Figure 1, for each variable frequency drive 14, a voltage output by the associated power<br>
circuit 18 is fed back to the associated controller 16 and a current output by the<br>
associated power circuit 18 is also fed back to the associated controller 16.<br>
 The variable frequency drives 14 do not communicate directly with<br>
each other. Each variable frequency drive 14 is structured and arranged to<br>
communicate with the master controller 12 at a data rate that is substantially less than<br>
any computation rate within the variable frequency drives 14 (e.g., approximately one<br>
to ten hertz). The relatively low data rate allows for the system 10 to be simpler and<br><br>
less expensive than systems utilizing master/slave arrangements. The system 10 may<br>
be utilized with any type of alternating current motor<br>
 Figure 2 illustrates various embodiments, of a power circuit 18 of the<br>
system 10. The power circuit 18 is representative of the power circuits 18 of each of<br>
the variable frequency drives 14. The power circuit 18 comprises a rectifier 22 and an<br>
inverter 24 connected to the rectifier 22. The rectifier 22 is connected to the controller<br>
16, and the inverter 24 is connected to a winding of the motor 20. According to various<br>
embodiments, the inverter 24 may comprise any number of switching devices such as,<br>
for example, insulated gate bipolar transistors, integrated gate commutating thyristors,<br>
MOSFETs, etc.<br>
 Figure 3 illustrates various embodiments of a controller 16 of the<br>
system 10. The controller 16 is representative of the controllers 16 of each of the<br>
variable frequency drives 14. The controller 16 comprises a speed droop module 26<br>
and a flux share module 28. The controller 16 also comprises a DQ-30 transform 30, a<br>
pulse width modulator 32, and a motor model 34. According to various embodiments,<br>
the motor model 34 is structured and arranged to determine a motor speed estimate and<br>
a motor flux estimate based on stator voltage and stator current measurements. The<br>
motor model 34 may also provide values for a magnetizing current component, a torque<br>
current component, and motor flux angle.<br>
 Figure 4 illustrates various embodiments of a speed droop module 26<br>
of the system 10. The speed droop module 26 is representative of the speed droop<br>
modules 26 of each of the variable frequency drives 14. The speed droop module 26 is<br>
structured and arranged to regulate a torque current component in the associated<br>
variable frequency drive 14. The speed droop module 28 comprises a speed ramp 36, a<br><br>
speed droop gain 38, a speed regulator 40, and a torque current regulator 42. In<br>
operation, the speed ramp 36 receives a speed demand from the master controller 12,<br>
and linearizes any change in the speed demand to a rate that is adjustable by a user.<br>
The speed droop gain 38 scales a torque current component value, and the scaled torque<br>
current component value is subtracted from the output of the speed ramp 36 to form the<br>
speed reference for the speed regulator 40. Thus, the speed droop module 26 is also<br>
structured and arranged to determine a speed reference based on the torque current<br>
component value. The introduction of torque current into the speed reference promotes<br>
torque current sharing by the variable frequency drives 14.<br>
 According to other embodiments, the speed droop module 26 may be<br>
structured and arranged such that the speed droop gain 38 scales the torque current<br>
reference instead of the torque current component value. For such embodiments, the<br>
speed reference for the speed regulator 40 is formed by subtracting the scaled torque<br>
current reference from the output of the speed ramp 36.<br>
 When one of the variable frequency drives 14 is delivering more<br>
torque current than the other variable frequency drives 14, the speed droop module 26<br>
operates to subtract a larger torque current component value from the output of the<br>
speed ramp 36. This action leads to the variable frequency drive 14 reducing its output<br>
frequency for a period of time until the phase shift between its output voltage and the<br>
back-emf of the motor 20 is reduced to a desired value. As there is a direct relationship<br>
between torque current and the phase angle between the output voltage of the variable<br>
frequency drive 14 and the back-emf of the motor 20, the reduced phase angle results in<br>
less torque current being delivered by the variable frequency drive 14. The other<br>
variable frequency drives 14, which have a smaller torque current component value<br><br>
being subtracted from the respective outputs of their speed ramps 36, are able to<br>
increase their output frequency, thereby allowing them to deliver more torque current<br>
such that all of the variable frequency drives 14 are delivering substantially the same<br>
amount of torque current.<br>
 Figure 5 illustrates various embodiments of a flux share module 28 of<br>
the system 10. The flux share module 28 is representative of the flux share modules 28<br>
of each of the variable frequency drives 14. The flux share module 28 is structured and<br>
arranged to regulate a magnetizing current component in the associated variable<br>
frequency drive 14. The flux share module 28 comprises a flux ramp 44, a flux droop<br>
gain 46, a flux regulator 48, and a magnetizing current regulator 50. In operation, the<br>
flux ramp 44 receives a flux demand from the master controller 12, and linearizes any<br>
change in the flux demand to a rate that is adjustable by a user. The flux droop gain 46<br>
scales an error between an average magnetizing current component value provided by<br>
the master controller 12 and an output of the flux regulator 48. The average<br>
magnetizing current component value is determined by the master controller 12 based<br>
on the magnetizing current component value reported by each of the variable frequency<br>
drives 14. The output of the flux regulator 48 is the magnetizing current reference.<br>
The scaled error is added to the output of the flux ramp 44 to form the flux reference<br>
for the flux regulator 48. Thus, the flux share module 28 is also structured and<br>
arranged to determine a flux reference based on the magnetizing current component<br>
value. The introduction of magnetizing current error into the flux reference serves to<br>
have the variable frequency drives 14 operate with a minimum error on the magnetizing<br>
current components, thereby promoting magnetizing current sharing by the variable<br>
frequency drives 14.<br><br>
 When one of the variable frequency drives 14 is delivering a<br>
magnetizing current that is greater than the average magnetizing current component<br>
value provided by the master controller 12, the flux share module 28 operates to add the<br>
scaled error to the output of the flux ramp 44, effectively reducing the value of the flux<br>
reference. The reduction in the flux reference causes the flux regulator 48 to lower the<br>
magnetizing current reference, which in turn decreases the magnetizing current due to<br>
the action of the magnetizing current regulator 50. When one of the variable frequency<br>
drives 14 is delivering a magnetizing current that is less than the average magnetizing<br>
current component value provided by the master controller 12, the opposite occurs.<br>
Thus, all of the variable frequency drives 14 may be controlled to deliver substantially<br>
the same amount of magnetizing current.<br>
 According to other embodiments, the flux share module 28 may be<br>
structured and arranged such that the flux droop gain 46 scales an error between an<br>
average magnetizing current reference provided by the master controller 12 and an<br>
output of the flux regulator 48. The average magnetizing current reference may be<br>
determined by the master controller 12 based on the respective magnetizing current<br>
reference reported by each of the variable frequency drives 14. For such embodiments,<br>
the flux reference for the flux regulator 48 is formed by adding the scaled error to the<br>
output of the flux ramp 44.<br>
 According to yet other embodiments, the flux share module 28 may be<br>
structured and arranged such that the output of the flux regulator 48 is utilized as the<br>
reference for the field supply current when the motor 20 is a synchronous motor. An<br>
error between the average field supply current and the actual field supply current may<br>
be utilized to effect a change in the flux reference. For such embodiments, the<br><br>
magnetizing current reference becomes a fixed value that is used in all of the variable<br>
frequency drives 14. The fixed value may be, for example, zero, or a value which is<br>
equal to the output of a proportional regulator portion of the flux regulator 48.<br>
 While several embodiments of the invention have been described<br>
herein by way of example, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various<br>
modifications, alterations, and adaptations to the described embodiments may be<br>
realized without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined by the<br>
