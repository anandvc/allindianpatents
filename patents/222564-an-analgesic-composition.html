The present invention relates to analgesic compositions, containing buprenorphine and, in particular, to compositions which contain buprenorphine at a sub-clinical analgesic dose level in combination with naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene.<br>
Buprenorphine (International Non-proprietary Name for N-cyclopropylmethyl-7a-[l-(S)-hydroxy-1,2,2-trimethylpropyl] 6,14-endoethano-6, 7,8,14-tetrahydro-nororipavine) has been shown in clinical trials to be a potent opiate partial agonist analgesic lacking the psychotomimetic effects found with other opiate analgesics.  Buprenorphine effectively relieves moderate to severe pain in doses of 0.1 mg or more administered either parenterally or sublingually.  The optimum therapeutic range for single doses is 0.3 mg - 0.6 mg by injection and 0.2 mg-0.8 mg for sublingual tablets.<br>
In animal tests and in man buprenorphine has been shown to have both agonist (morphine-like) and antagonist properties.  However from direct dependence studies in animals and in man it has been concluded that buprenorphine does not produce significant physical dependence, as indicated by animal self administration studies and by the measurement of euphorigenic effects in human post addicts.  However, buprenorphine suffers from side effects typical of opiate agonists such as nausea and vomiting, constipation and respiratory depression in some patients, although there is a ceiling to its effects on respiratory depression as a direct consequence of its partial agonist properties.<br>
Naloxone (International Non-proprietary Name for l-N-allyl-14-hydroxynorhydromorphinone) is a narcotic antagonist which has been incorporated into oral and sublingual preparations of various opioids in order to protect the preparations from parenteral abuse, whilst maintaining the analgesic effect of the opioid.<br>
GB-ii-2150832 describes analgesic compositions in sublingual or parenteral dosage form comprising an active<br><br>
dose of buprenorphine and an amount of naloxone sufficient to prove aversive to a narcotic addict by parenteral administration but insufficient to compromise the analgesic action of the buprenorphine.  Preferably the parenteral dosage form contains naloxone and buprenorphine within the weight ratio of 1:3 to 1:1 and the sublingual form within the ratio 1:2 to 2:1.<br>
Naltrexone (International Non-proprietary Name for l-N-cyclopropylmethyl-14-hydroxynordihydro-morphinone) is a pure opiate antagonist which, when administered orally (50 mg/day) as a maintenance drug for opiate addicts, blocks the effects of self-administered opiates and this contributes to the extinction of drug craving,<br>
Nalmefene (International Non-Proprietary Name for (5a)-17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5-epoxy-6-methylene-morphinan-3,14-diol) is a structural analogue of naltrexone with opiate antagonist activity.<br>
GB-A-2167633 describes an analgesic composition in parenteral or sublingual unit dosage form comprising an active dose of buprenorphine and an amount of naltrexone sufficient to prove aversive to a narcotic addict by parenteral administration but insufficient to compromise the analgesic action of the buprenorphine wherein the dose of buprenorphine in the parenteral form is from about 0.3mg to about 0.6mg and in the sublingual form from about 0.1mg to about 0.4mg and the weights of buprenorphine to naltrexone for the parenteral form are within the ratio of 12:1 to 3:1 and for the sublingual form are within the ratio 4:1 to 1:1.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that sub-clinical dosage levels of buprenorphine are potentiated and enhanced by low doses of naloxone or naltrexone or nalmefene. The interaction between the drugs is a synergistic interaction and more than the additive effects of the separate drug entities.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides in its broadest aspect an analgesic composition in parenteral unit dosage form or in a unit dosage form suitable for delivery via the mucosa comprising an amount of<br><br>
buprenorphine which is less than the clinical dose required to achieve pain relief and<br>
(i)  an amount of naloxone such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naloxone is in the range of from 12.5:1 to 27-5:1, or (ii) an amount of naltrexone or nalmefene such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naltrexone or nalmefene is in the range of from 12-5:1 to 22-5:1<br>
whereby the analgesic action of the buprenorphine is potentiated by the low dose of naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene.<br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides an analgesic composition in parenteral or sublingual unit dosage form or in a unit dosage form suitable for delivery via the mucosa comprising from 15ug to 200pg of buprenorphine per unit dose and<br>
(i)  an amount of naloxone such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naloxone is in the range of from 12-5:1 to 27-5:1, or (ii) an amount of naltrexone or nalmefene such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naltrexone or nalmefene is in the range of from 12-5:1 to 22-5:1 . It is to be understood that the terms buprenorphine, naloxone, naltrexone and nalmefene as used herein are meant to cover not only the bases but their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.  Particularly preferred salts are   the hydrochlorides.<br>
It is preferable to formulate the compositions in unit dosage forms i.e. physically discrete units containing the appropriate amounts of buprenorphine and naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene, together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents and/or carriers. Such unit dosage forms for parenteral administration are suitably in the form of ampoules and for delivery via the mucosa may, for example, be in the form of tablets for sublingual administracion.<br><br>
The term parenteral is intended to encompass administration of the compositions by any way other than through the alimentary tract.<br>
The term mucosa is intended to encompass any mucous membrane and includes oral mucosa, rectal mucosa, vaginal mucosa and nasal mucosa.<br>
Compositions intended for parenteral administration comprise an isotonic solution of buprenorphine and naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene in sterile water. Conveniently the solution is made isotonic by use of dextrose and sterilised by autoclaving or by filtration through a membrane filter.  The compositions may be administered intramuscularly, intradermally, intraperitonealy,  intravenously, intraarterially, subcutaneously or by the epidural route.  The compositions may also be administered transdermally.<br>
Compositions in the form of sublingual tablets contain soluble excipients such as lactose, mannitol, dextrose, sucrose or mixtures thereof.  They will also contain granulating and disintegrating agents such as starch, binding agents such as povidone or hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate.<br>
The compositions for parenteral administration, or for delivery via the mucosa, such as by sublingual administration, as detailed above, may be prepared by manufacturing techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compositions of the present invention in unit dosage form preferably contain the naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene in an amount such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene is in the range of from 15:1 to 20:1.<br>
The compositions of the present invention contain buprenorphine in an amount which is below that required in a unit dose no obtain pain relief.  In the human being, dosages of about 4 0)ig of buprenorphine per kilogram of body weight are required to obtain satisfactory pain relief in the absence of potentiation.<br><br>
Thus for typical body weights of 50 to 80 kg, the dosage would toe from 2C00pg to 3200ug, i.e. from 2mg to 3.2mg of buprenorphine per day.  This would conveniently be administered as A   unit doses.  The amounts of buprenorphine which are effective in the present invention are below the amounts which are effective in the absence of the potentiating effects of naloxone, naltrexone or naltnefene.<br>
In a second aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment of pain in a human or animal subject, which method comprises the administraticn to the human or animal by the parenteral or via the mucosa route of from l-25ng to 10g per hilogram of body weight of buprenorphine per day and<br>
(i)  an amount of naloxone such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naloxone administered ie in the range of from 12-5:1 to 27-5:1, or (ii) an amount of naltrexone or nalmefene such that the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naltrexone or nal/nefene administered is in the range of from 12-5:1 to 22-5:1-<br>
In a   third aspect the present invention provides the use of naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of pain comprising a sub-clinical amount of buprenorphine, wherein the ratio by weight ci buprenorphine to naloxone is in the range of from 12-5:1 to 27-5:1 or the ratio by weight of buprenorphine to naltrexone or nalmefene is in the range of from 12-5:1 to 22-5; 1.<br>
The ratios for the potentiation of the sub-clinical dosages of buprenorphine by low doses of the opiate antagonists were determined by the University Department of Anaesthesia, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge according to the paw withdrawal method of Hargreaves, K.K., Dubner, R., Brown, F., Floras, C. and Joris, J.: A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception   in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia. Pain 32: 77-88,<br><br>
1988.      This method  enables  the  researcher  to  discern  a peripherally mediated   response  to  thermal   stimulation caused  by   drugs   in  the  unrestrained  rat.<br>
The   results  were  obtained using a  BASILE   Plantar Test   Device   (Ugo  Basile,   Comerio-Italy) .      It   basically consists   of  a  movable   I.R.    (infrared)   Generator  placed below  a  glass  pane  upon  which the  operator  places   the rat.      A perspex  enclosure   defines   the   space   within  which the  animal   is  unrestrained.     It  is  divided  into  three compartments,   v.'hich   helps   the  operator   to   carry  out   rapid "screening"  work:   up   to   three  rats   can   be  tested  with  no appreciable  delay  in  between.<br>
The   operator  positions   the   I.R.   Generator   directly beneath   the  hind paw  of  the   rat  and  activates   both   the I.R.   Source   and  a   reaction  time  counter.     When   the   rat feels   pain   and withdraws   its   paw,   the   I.R.   Generator   is automatically   switched  off   and  the   timer   stops, determining   the  withdrawal   latency.<br>
The   effects   of   buprenorphine   at  various   dosages, naloxone   at   various   dosages,   naltrexone   at   various dosages;   and  buprenorphine   in   combination  with   naloxone   or naltrexone   at   various   dosages   were  determined   by   testing adult   rats   in  which   peripheral mononeuropathy  was produced by  placing   three   loosely  constrictive   ligatures around  the   common   sciatic   nerve.     The   testing   was   carried out  on  the  eighth  day  following  the  operative   procedure.<br>
In   order  to  determine   a   baseline   for   comparison purpos   s,   rats   were   subjected  to  the  Hargreaves   paw withdrawal   test  before   the   subcutaneous   injection   of   the various   drugs  or  drug   combinations   being  tested.      The rats  were   then   injected   subcutaneously   with   the particular  drug  or  drug   combination  being  tested  and  the percentage  change   in   time   for  the  rat   to  withdraw   its  paw from ti u  thermal   stimulation,   in  comparison  with   the baseline,   was   recorded  as   a  percentage   in  paw  withdrawal latency.<br>
The  invention   is   further  described   with   reference   to the  following  Examples.<br><br>
METHODS<br>
Surgery<br>
Lister  Hooded  rats   {180-20Og)   were  anaesthetised with   halothane  and  the   left   sciatic nerve   was   loosely ligated  with  3   chromic   cat   gut  sutures   to   induce   a neuropathy.<br>
Rats   were  left  to  recover  for  one week   after  the procedure  before  commencing behavioural   testing.<br>
Drug   preparation<br>
The  drugs   (buprenorphine,   naloxone  and  naltrexone) were   prepared  freshly  in  water   at   a   concentration   of   1 mg/ml.      The   stocks  were  then  diluted in  saline   to  obtain the   different   concentrations   used  in  the   study.<br>
Drugs   were   injected  sub-cutaneously  in  the   fold  of the   neck.<br>
Testing<br>
After 8 days, thermal nociceptive threshold, as determined by hindpaw withdrawal latency, was measured using a plantar test Ugo Basile, Comero, Italy).  Prior to testing, the rat was placed in the perspex box and allowed 5 minutes to habituate.  The heat source was positioned under the plantar surface of one hind paw at random and activated.  This initiated a timing circuit which measured the time interval between the application of the light beam and the withdrawal of the hind paw. This value was assigned as the withdrawal latency.<br>
Paw withdrawal latency was determined before injection and at different times after injection.  Three measurements were taken per paw.<br>
EXAMPIE 1<br>
The effects of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/ naloxone at weight ratios of 20:1 and 15:1 were determined at various doses of buprenorphine expressed as<br><br>
pg/kg of body weight of the drug administered subcutaneously to rats (n=3) .<br>
The results of these tests are given in Figure 1. The potentiation of sub-clinical doses of buprenorphine by low dose naloxone can be clearly seen from the graph of Figure 1. Both of the buprenorphine/naloxone combinations showed marked increases in pain withdrawal latencies at both weight ratios where the buprenorphine dose was 1.25ug and 2.5M.g, compared to buprenorphine alone which had no significant effect at these dosage levels.<br>
EXAMPIE 2<br>
Buprenorphine was administered to rats (n=6) at a dosage level of 2.5ug/kg of body weight of the rats. Buprenorphine was co-administered subcutaneously with either naloxone or naltrexone at various weight ratios ranging from 5:1 to 30:1,  In order to provide appropriate baseline points naloxone and naltrexone alone were also administered subcutaneously to rats at the same dosage levels as those used in the combined treatments.<br>
The results are given in Figure 2 from which the potentiation of the sub-clinical doses of buprenorphine by naloxone or naltrexone can be clearly seen.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
To investigate the duration of action of several ratios (10:1, 15:1 and 20:1 buprenorphine:naloxone, with a fixed dose of buprenorphine) the effect on PWL was followed over a 26 hour period following subcutaneous injection.  The results are given in Figure 3 from which it can be seen that the effect was already maximal after 40 minutes and then decreased sharply over 6 hours. However at 26  hours a residual effect was still visible, although this was not statistically significant.  The maximal effect of each ratio (40min) was compatible with the results shown in Figure 2.  The effect observed with<br><br>
the   10:1  ratio  combination  was  not   statistically significant.<br>
