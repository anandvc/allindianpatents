Description<br>
The invention relates to a luminescent composition<br>
which is based on yttrium oxide sulfide and further<br>
oxide sulfides and to which at least one dopant has<br>
been added. The composition has a characteristic<br>
emission spectrum and can, if appropriate together with<br>
a reading system matched to the emission spectrum, be<br>
used for marking materials or mixtures of materials.<br>
Compounds containing lanthanide ions in the oxidation<br>
state +3 are often luminophors which on excitation with<br>
radiation in the infrared range emit shorter wavelength<br>
light, e.g. in the visible range and/or in the UV<br>
range. This property, referred to as "up conversion" or<br>
"anti-Stokes fluorescence", can be attributed to the<br>
electrons of the 4f shell of lanthanide ions being<br>
raised by sequential multiple excitation on irradiation<br>
to an energy level which has been increased by more<br>
than the energy corresponding to absorption of a single<br>
photon. A photon which has a higher energy than the<br>
originally absorbed photon can be emitted from this<br>
energy level on relaxation.<br>
The use of lanthanide oxide sulfides as anti-Stokes<br>
luminophors is described, for example, in WO 00/60527<br>
and in the US patents 6 802 992 and 6 686 074. Further-<br>
more, the use of these lanthanide oxide sulfides for<br>
marking materials or mixtures of materials is known.<br>
According to the present invention, novel luminescent<br>
compositions which are based on the oxide sulfides of<br>
yttrium and at least three other elements and to which<br>
at least one dopant, preferably selected from among<br>
oxides and fluorides of main group and transition group<br><br>
elements, has been added are provided.<br>
The present invention firstly provides a luminescent<br>
composition comprising<br>
(a)	an oxide sulfide of yttrium and oxide sulfides of<br>
at least three further elements selected from<br>
among lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium,<br>
samarium,	europium,	gadolinium,	terbium,<br>
dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium<br>
and lutetium and<br>
(b)	at least one dopant selected from among oxides and<br>
fluorides of main group and transition group<br>
elements.<br>
The composition of the invention is a luminophor having<br>
"up converter" and/or "anti-Stokes" properties. It is<br>
preferably in crystalline form. Furthermore, it is<br>
preferred that the composition consists of a single<br>
phase, for example a crystalline phase, which can be<br>
established by X-ray diffraction methods. The composi-<br>
tion is usually in the form of particles having an<br>
average particle size of &gt; 50 pm, in particular &gt; 1 nm.<br>
The particle size is preferably in the range 1 nm-<br>
100 μm, preferably 5 nm-50 μm and particularly prefer-<br>
ably about 100 nm-10 μm.<br>
Component (a) of the composition is formed by an oxide<br>
sulfide of yttrium and oxide sulfides of at least three<br>
further elements as indicated above. Yttrium and the<br>
further elements are usually present as trivalent<br>
cations, so that component (a) of the composition of<br>
the invention can preferably be represented as follows:<br><br>
where M1, M2 and M3 are trivalent cations of at least<br>
three of the abovementioned elements and X is a number<br>
in the range from 0 to 0.5, preferably from 0 to 0.2.<br><br>
Particular preference is given to X being 0.<br>
In the total component (a) , the yttrium oxide sulfide<br>
is preferably present in a proportion of &gt; 90 mol%,<br>
particularly preferably &gt; 92 mol%, even more preferably<br>
&gt; 94 mol% and most preferably &gt; 96 mol%. The further<br>
oxide sulfides are preferably present in a proportion<br>
of in each case up to 2 mol% based on the total<br>
component (a) . The further oxide sulfides are prefer-<br>
ably selected from among oxide sulfides of erbium,<br>
ytterbium and at least one further element, in<br>
particular lutetium, gadolinium, holmium, thulium,<br>
dysprosium and/or europium. The oxide sulfides of<br>
erbium and ytterbium are preferably present in a<br>
proportion of in each case 0.5-2 mol%, particularly<br>
preferably 1-2 mol%, based on the total component (a) .<br>
The further oxide sulfides are preferably used in<br>
smaller proportions of, for example, 0.1-1 mol%, parti-<br>
cularly preferably 0.1-0.5 mol%, based on the total<br>
component (a) .<br>
For example, the component (a) of the composition can<br>
contain oxide sulfides of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or even more<br>
further elements in addition to the oxide sulfide of<br>
yttrium.<br>
The composition of the invention additionally contains,<br>
as component (b) , at least one dopant selected from<br>
among oxides and fluorides of main group and transition<br>
group elements. The dopants are preferably present in a<br>
proportion of in each case up to 5 mol%, particularly<br>
preferably in each case up to 2 mol%, even more prefer-<br>
ably in each case up to 1 mol%, even more preferably<br>
0.05-1 mol% and most preferably 0.1-0.2 mol%, based on<br>
the sum of the components (a) and (b).<br>
A preferred dopant is a fluoride, which can be used,<br><br>
for example, as an alkaline earth metal fluoride or as<br>
an alkali metal fluoride, e.g. as potassium fluoride.<br>
The fluoride is preferably present in a proportion of<br>
0.1-0.2 mol%, based on the sum of the components (a)<br>
and (b).<br>
Further preferred dopants are alkaline earth metals<br>
and/or transition group elements which are present as<br>
cations bearing two or even more positive charges,<br>
preferably in the form of oxides and/or fluorides.<br>
Particularly preferred dopants are calcium, zinc and/or<br>
titanium, for example in the form of the oxides calcium<br>
oxide, zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. The cationic<br>
dopants are preferably present in a proportion of in<br>
each case 0.1-0.2 mol%, based on the sum of the compo-<br>
nents (a) and (b).<br>
The luminescent compositions comprising the components<br>
(a) and (b) firstly have a high luminescence intensity<br>
and secondly have emission lines or peaks which are<br>
characteristic of the presence and proportions of the<br>
individual components. Thus, specific combinations of<br>
oxide sulfides and dopants make it possible to obtain a<br>
virtually unlimited number of different emission<br>
spectra which can be detected by means of a reading<br>
system matched specifically to the respective spectrum.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be produced by<br>
homogenizing yttrium oxide (Y2O3) powder with oxides of<br>
the other elements, e.g. ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3) , erbium<br>
oxide (Er2O3) and other oxides such as HO2O3, Lu2O3<br>
and/or Gd2O3, and also the dopants or precursors there-<br>
of, e.g. TiO2, CaCO3, ZnO and/or KF, by milling and<br>
subsequently sintering the mixture at elevated tempera-<br>
ture, e.g. 1200-1700°C, in a furnace, preferably in<br>
air, in order to achieve homogeneous distribution of<br>
the cations in the crystal lattice. The sintered<br><br>
product is subsequently milled and reacted with H2S at<br>
temperatures in the range from 700°C to 1000°C,<br>
preferably for 2-12 h, giving a uniform phase based on<br>
Y2O2S and containing further oxide sulfides and also the<br>
dopants. The addition of fluoride as dopant leads to a<br>
homogeneous distribution of the lanthanide ions in the<br>
host lattice during the sintering process. The addition<br>
of dopants, e.g. polyvalent cations and/or fluoride,<br>
brings about drastic changes in the position and/or<br>
intensities of individual emission wavelengths.<br>
Furthermore, a large increase in the total luminescence<br>
intensity occurs. It is assumed that a three-photon<br>
absorption takes place in addition to the two-photon<br>
absorption known for anti-Stokes materials.<br>
The luminophors of the invention can be used as detec-<br>
tion and marking materials, for example as safety mark-<br>
ing of materials or mixtures of materials. In this way,<br>
the authenticity of products or documents can be deter-<br>
mined. The luminophor can, since it is chemically<br>
inert, be introduced into any solid and/or liquid<br>
materials or mixtures of materials or be applied<br>
thereto. For example, the luminophor can be applied to<br>
or introduced into carrier substances such as surface<br>
coating compositions, toners, inks, paints, etc, or<br>
products such as plastics, metals, glass, silicones,<br>
paper, rubber, etc. The luminophor is preferably added<br>
to the product or part of the product in an amount of<br>
10-50 ppm, preferably 50-200 ppm. The luminophor of the<br>
invention is also suitable for use in biological<br>
systems, e.g. cell cultures, samples of body fluids or<br>
tissue sections or as contrast enhancer. Here, the<br>
luminophor in nanoparticulate or microparticulate forms<br>
can be coupled to biological detection reagents.<br>
Furthermore, the surfaces of particles of the lumino-<br>
phor can be modified by means of deodetomines or other<br>
bonding substances in order to improve the suspending<br><br>
properties, e.g. in organic liquids such as oils,<br>
naphthas, liquefied gases, etc., in aqueous liquids<br>
such as body fluids, in aqueous-organic liquid systems<br>
and flowable powders such as toners. The smaller the<br>
particles, the lower is the tendency for sedimentation<br>
to occur. The particle size can, for example, be<br>
reduced by intensive milling to such an extent, e.g. to<br>
liquids is achieved even without the addition of<br>
bonding substances.<br>
Security against falsification of the marking is<br>
provided by the emission lines characteristic of the<br>
respective luminophor representing a cryptographic key<br>
which can be detected by a detector, i.e. the lock,<br>
matched to the respective material.<br>
The detection of the presence of the luminophor can be<br>
effected by irradiation with a wavelength in the<br>
infrared range, in particular with IR monocoherent<br>
laser light or with an IR light-emitting diode having<br>
wavelengths in the range from about 850 to 1500 nm,<br>
preferably from about 920 to 1000 nm, particularly<br>
preferably about 950-1000 nm, most preferably from 920<br>
to 985 nm, with the luminophor being excited and the<br>
emitted radiation in the range of wavelengths charac-<br>
teristic for the respective luminophor, for instance in<br>
the range from 3 00 to 170 0 nm, being detected. Irradia-<br>
tion is preferably carried out at a power of 1-200 mW,<br>
in particular 10-80 mW. The irradiation of the product<br>
containing the luminophor can be carried out directly<br>
or by means of an optical waveguide or another<br>
optically relevant transfer medium, e.g. an optical<br>
solid body, a fluid, gas, etc. Detection can be<br>
effected visually or by means of detectors.<br>
It is possible to use, for example, optical waveguides<br><br>
whose heads are ground as collecting lenses so that<br>
incident light (IR light) and light emitted by the<br>
luminophor (specific emission spectrum) form one unit<br>
and can be focused at the same point. An advantage is<br>
that no mechanical misalignment between receiver and<br>
transmitter can occur. The damping factor of the<br>
optical waveguide, e.g. of glass or plastic, can vary,<br>
with the transition from the optical components<br>
(radiation source or detection element) to the optical<br>
waveguide being constructed so as to be low in<br>
covision. The length of the optical waveguide can vary<br>
and is typically in the range from 1 cm to 50 cm.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a luminophor<br>
having a characteristic emission spectrum is detected<br>
by means of a reading system matched to this emission<br>
spectrum. The reading system comprises a radiation<br>
source, preferably a radiation source in the IR range,<br>
and one or more optical detection elements which are<br>
provided for the selective detection of specific<br>
emission lines of the luminophor, e.g. in respect of<br>
the wavelength and/or intensity. The detection elements<br>
can be, for example, diodes, photoelements or electro-<br>
nic detectors. Preference is given to using detector<br>
matrices having a plurality of preferably differently<br>
set detectors, e.g. diode matrices, photoelement<br>
matrices or CCD matrices. The detectors or individual<br>
detectors of the detector matrix can be combined with<br>
optical filters, e.g. bandpass filters, which can also<br>
be vapor deposited on the detection element. The<br>
filters are preferably selected so that they allow<br>
passage of light in only a particular wavelength range,<br>
e.g. a range of 5-15 nm, preferably about 10 nm. The<br>
filters preferably contain high- and low-refraction<br>
layers such as TiO2 and SiO2. This ensures that bandpass<br>
filters having very small rise-fall flanks per optical<br>
element are provided. The passage of light which does<br><br>
not correspond to the wavelength characteristic of the<br>
luminophor is prevented.<br>
The use of detectors or detector matrices which detect<br>
a plurality of emission lines of differing wavelength,<br>
e.g. 2, 3, 4 or more emission lines, which are charac-<br>
teristic of a particular luminophor makes it possible<br>
to provide a verification system having a high degree<br>
of security. The reading system may, if appropriate,<br>
also contain detectors which operate at wavelengths at<br>
which there is no emission line and thus serve as<br>
negative control.<br>
The reading system can also, if appropriate, contain a<br>
programmable electronic unit which can be reprogrammed<br>
to other emission lines when required.<br>
Furthermore, a plurality of different luminophors which<br>
can be evaluated either visually on the basis of<br>
different colors and/or by means of detectors can be<br>
applied to a product or a carrier. These different<br>
applications can be arranged beneath, above or next to<br>
one another, so that a complex and characteristic<br>
pattern is obtained. For example, when two different<br>
luminophors are applied next to one another on a<br>
product, irradiation with a suitable IR source results<br>
in emission of two different colors, giving a flip-flop<br>
effect.<br>
The verification system according to the	invention can<br>
also be combined with other verification	systems, e.g.<br>
systems based on bacteriorhodopsin or	specific DNA<br>
sequences.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is illustrated by<br>
the following example.<br><br>
Example 1: Production of a luminophor<br>
Pulverulent yttrium oxide was milled together with<br>
pulverulent oxides of ytterbium and erbium, in each<br>
case in proportions of 1-2 mol%, and other lanthanide<br>
oxides such as oxides of holmium, lutetium and/or<br>
gadolinium, in each case in proportions of 0.1-<br>
0.5 mol%, and also dopants Ti02, CaC03/ ZnO and/or KF,<br>
in each case in proportions of 0.1-0.2 mol%, in a ball<br>
mill for 3 hours. The resulting mixtures were sintered<br>
in air at 1500°C in a furnace for 24-72 hours. The<br>
phase purity of the resulting sintered products was<br>
confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The sintered products<br>
were subsequently milled and the resulting powders were<br>
reacted with H2S at temperatures in the range from<br>
800°C to 900°C for 2-12 hours. Phase-pure crystalline<br>
compounds of the Y202S type were obtained, as was<br>
confirmed by X-ray diffraction.<br>
Figure 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction measurement<br>
on a sample of the composition (Yb, Er, Lu, Y) 203 in the<br>
ratio 1.0:1.0:0.5:97.5. The measurement was carried out<br>
using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (copper K-alpha<br>
radiation). Only lattice reflections of the host<br>
lattice Y2O2S could be seen (formation of mixed crystals<br>
by substitution). Only a slight shift in the reflec-<br>
tions caused by other ions incorporated into the host<br>
lattice can be observed. Since no further reflections<br>
are present, the material is a phase-pure crystalline<br>
product containing no further crystalline phases<br>
(secondary phases).<br><br>
