				<td>This invention relates to a degradable polymeric composition, a process therefore and products thereof.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention particularly relates to a polymeric composition that is photo degradable as well as biodegradable. Further the invention relates to a multicomponent composition. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of the title product. The process according to the present invention employs readily available components. The process is simple to operate commercially feasible and cost effective. The invention also claims the products such as plastic films, containers packaging material involving the polymeric composition of the present invention particularly when prepared by the process of this invention. The products thus prepared have improved thermal sealing properties and superior mechanical properties. The products are suitable for using at low or subzero level temperatures<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Plastics are used extensively in almost every field. Among the various applications, plastics are used mostly in packaging. The use of plastics has given rise to improved methods of packaging goods. For example, polyethylene and polypropylene plastic films, bags, bottles, Styrofoam cups, blister packages, and the like provide stable, relatively unbreakable, chemically resistant lightweight packaging. With the wide acceptance of thermoplastic articles the market size of plastic has grown to over 150 million tones and is expected to double by 2010. A reference can be made to USP 0040062884, Economic Times Polymer, June - July 2005. Plastics have also found wide spread use in other disposable products such as, for example, disposable personal care products such as diapers, disposable work tools/ instruments/garments, and other disposable garments. Though many advantages of plastics have lead to their increased usage in a variety of products, the increased usage, however, has resulted in accumulation of huge amount of solid waste, since the plastic must be disposed of after it is used and thereby has created a serious environmental problem. As a result of the stability and durability of plastics, however, they tend to remain in our environment for a long time, without decomposing after disposal. It has been estimated that over 50<br>
 <br>
percent of the annual tonnage of all manufactured synthetic polymers are applied as packaging materials and that 90 percent of this ends up as a component of urban garbage. It has also been estimated that recalcitrant plastic accumulates in our environment at a rate of 25 million tons per year.<br>
Burning of plastics is an unsatisfactory disposal solution, since this tends to discharge smoke that adds to air pollution and destruction of the ozone layer. Burial in a waste site is also not an effective means of disposal. Composting is also not advisable due to non-degradable nature of the plastics. Thus Landfill was the only adoptable disposal method. However, accumulation of plastics in our environment has tended to result in landfills becoming filled to capacity; unsightly litter destroying the scenery and landscape; and destruction of the living environment for marine life and other forms of life in turn impairing ecosystem as a whole.<br>
In an effort to resolve the environmental problem, several techniques have been adopted to attribute the degradable characteristics to the polymer. The need is further enhanced due to decreasing landfill space. The problem can also be solved by incorporating additives in certain ways with the polymeric compositions used to make plastics to increase the rate at which the plastic is degraded to environmentally friendly compounds. These additives, commonly called degradants, increase the rate of degradation of the plastic. The degradation could be photodegradation, biological degradation, and/or chemical degradation. However, blending of the degradants with the virgin polymer affects the other properties of the plastics such as mechanical strength and resistance to moisture.<br>
The existing art known to the inventor includes US Patent No. US2002028857. In accordance with this patent, there have been over 500 patents in the last thirty years. Yet none of these patents has led to products which have been successful in establishing appreciable markets in the overall plastics market due to following reasons:<br>
1) the articles lacked sufficient strength, 2) the articles had poor shelf life, 3) the articles were too expensive, and/or 4) fabrication into a useful article was difficult.<br>
The invention relates to biodegradable and/or compostable polymeric composition in the form of hollow/filled isotropically oriented plastic microspheres with potential use for forming films, coatings, fibers, molded articles or thermoformed articles.<br>
 <br>
US 200202885, US5,397,759, and US 5,225,230 also relate to compostable Biodegradable polymeric composition in form of micro-spheres that involve multistage process.<br>
Us Patent No. 5,334,520 related to Id's 'BIOPOL' advocates using po!y-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyhydroxyvalerate for the preparation degradable plastics. The patent claims to achieve advantage over the prior art disclosing employing genetically modified Escherichia coli (E. coli) by eliminating the stringent process and operational conditions. However, despite PHB's advantages over other materials, its high cost of production has hindered its performance in the market<br>

WO 94/13735 discloses a degradable thermoplastic compositions. The compositions include a thermoplastic polymer component combined with a directly biodegradable component, an oxidizable component, transition metal additives, and an aromatic ketone. The polymeric material degrades in three stages. The first stage is biological<br>
 <br>
removal of the directly biodegradable component which results in mass reduction and a highly porous material. The second stage is chemical and results in oxidative shortening of the long polymer chains to decrease their molecular weight and the third stage involves biological metabolism of the low molecular weight fragments. The process is cost extensive and cumbersome.<br>
US Pat. No. 6,482,872 also teaches incorporation of degradants selected from (i) photodegradant comprises one or more of aliphatic or aromatic ketones, quinones, peroxides, hydroperoxides, azo compounds, organic dyes, latent sensitizers, aromatic hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof; (ii) biodegradant comprises one or more of chitin, starch, cellulose, glucose derivatives, polysaccharides, poly-.beta.-hydroxybutylate, poly caprolactone, polyesters, carbodiimides, or mixtures thereof; and (iii) chemical degradant comprises one or more of a combination of a metal carboxylate and an aliphatic poly hydroxy-carboxyl acid, a combination of metal carboxylate and filler, or a transition metal complex. The degradants are generally added polymer immediately after the polymer is synthesized and while the polymer is still fluid to ensure proper homogeneous blend to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art that advocates addition of degradants to virgin polymer compositions by melting the virgin polymer or by master batching there by achieving cost effective technology with enhanced efficacy.<br>
US2004062884 relates to a multicomponent composition for photodegradable and biodegradable plastic articles, avoiding employing starch. The composition discloses using new bioactive material of chitin, casein and the like, with biodegradable aid component, photodegradable and auto-oxidation catalysis component, and nonmetallic minerals and the like. Under natural condition, the degraded material can be utilized by microorganism to release carbon dioxide and water, and acts as an eco-friendly plastic material. The process is not feasible for commercial purposes as it requires number of costly components in addition to being cumbersome.<br>
US 20050203208 discloses mineral filled polyester resin based degradable polymeric composition containing 10 to 50 wt % fillers. The fillers are selected from two different groups: the first consisting of block type fillers including inorganic carbonates, synthetic carbonates, feldspar, nepheline syenite, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum trihydrate, and diatomaceous earth; the second consisting of platy<br>
 <br>
fillers including talc, mica, or calcined clays, all having a particle size less than 150 mesh.<br>
As can be seen from the herein above disclosure the prior art suffers from one or the other problems making it commercially unfeasible. The main drawbacks are : lack of adequate strength, poor shelf life, cost extensive, and/or require sophisticated infrastructure and stringent operational conditions.<br>
Thus there felt an imperative need for a degradable polymeric composition which is cost effective, easy to operate, technically and commercially viable, eco-friendly, having desired mechanical properties, extended shelf life and makes use of easily and abundantly available ingredients.<br>
After continuous and painstaking R &amp; D work the inventors have arrived at a degradable polymeric composition employing high and low density olefins, saccharides, swellable polymer degradant in judicious manner. It is not possible to arrive at this composition without extensive human intervention and conducting extensive experiments. The prior art fails to give conclusive indication for arriving at the composition of this invention, which can have desired flexibility, shelflife, ability to use at varied temperature and complete degradation to minerals through photo and biodegradation.<br>
The novelty resides in making a functional polymeric blend, that is photodegradable as well as bio-degradable, into a packaging polymer using unique combination of ingredients particularly modified compatibilizer. The added advantage is that the polymer of the present invention is functional at subzero temperature.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
In the present invention polypropylene a UV susceptible olefin is blended with polysaccharide preferably modified polysaccharide and then the blend so obtained<br>
 <br>
is mixed with polyethylene to obtain polymeric composition useful for preparing a photo as well as biodegradable plastic articles such as films, molded material/containers, and fibres. It may be worthwhile to mention here that though polypropylene and polyethylene are of polyolefin origin, pose problems in forming homogeneous mixture due to difference in crystallanity and other microstructure the two components. The presence of methyl group attached to alternate carbon atoms on the chain backbone of polypropylene is responsible in altering the properties of polypropylene. A reference can be made to an article by J.A. Brydson, Plastic materials, fifth edition, Butterworth, 1989, p.237.<br>
In the present invention a copolymer containing maleic anhydrideas one of the monomers has been employed as compatibilizer. This co-polymer facilitates the blending of polypropylene and polyethylene. Additionally the said copolymer also acts as cation exchange agent for smectite clay used as reinforcing agent. Smectite clay is known for its swelling property when contacted with water. It is known to be of expanding lattice type in which polymeric component can be reacted or accommodated. The group of clay can be easily modified by a compound capable of exchanging cations and thus can be incorporated in the polymeric matrix without any hiderence. The clay employed in the present invention is modified to a nano clay by successive sieving and chemically treating with oxidizing agent selected from hydrochloride, peracetic acid, perchloric acid, or hydrogen peroxide. The structural details of the modified clay is a subject matter of Indian Patent application No. 1354/DEL/2005 and is incorporated in entirety by way of reference in this application.<br>
Polyamide helps improving physical properties whenever incorporated. The composition is prepared as detailed herein above.<br>
Physical mixture of degradable polymer and polymer susceptible to UV light is compounded by melt extrusion in a twin extruder. The polymeric bio-photo degradable composition is thus made in the form of compounded cylindrical chips of about 2 to 3mm diameter and 2 to 4 mm length. The chips are then added to LDPE in a polyethylene bag/container and tumbling it thoroughly before putting in to extruder. This mixing may be made more uniform by addition of small quantity of light paraffin oil say 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight of the total weight of chips and LDPE granules. Compatibilizer and reinforcing agent are then added and the contents are again tumbled to ensure proper mixing. The pre wettings of chips by<br>
 <br>
paraffin oil helps in proper adherence of powdery particles of the compatibilizer and reinforcing agent and thereby ensure uniform mixing. Twin extruder used for melt extrusion may be co-rotating or counter-rotating type. Blown films were made using the compounded chips in a blown film machine having seven heating zones of graded temperature between 100 to 230°C.<br>
Alternately the polymeric blend comprising of degradable polymer, polymer susceptible to UV light and LDPE is taken in a polyethylene bag/container and tumbling it thoroughly in presence of of small quantity of light paraffin oil say 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight of the total weight of chips and LDPE granules. Compatibilizer and reinforcing agent are then added and the contents are again tumbled to ensure proper mixing. The pre wettings of chips by paraffin oil helps in proper adherence of powdery particles of the compatibilizer and reinforcing agent and thereby ensure uniform mixing. The composition thus obtained is compounded by melt extrusion in a twin extruder. The polymeric bio-photo degradable composition is thus made in the form of compounded cylindrical chips of about 2 to 3mm diameter and 2 to 4 mm length.<br>
Twin extruder used for melt extrusion may be co-rotating or counter-rotating type. Blown films were made using the compounded chips in a blown film machine having seven heating zones of graded temperature between 100 to 230°C. The invention is further illustrated with the examples.
