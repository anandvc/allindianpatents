STATEMENT OF RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001]	This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/799,842 filed on May 13,2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] This invention generally relates to industrial or laboratory mixing of various<br>
substances, such as (but not limited to) gases and liquids that may be employed in bioreactors<br>
performing cell culture or fermentation operations.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
[0003] The mixing of components, such as different types of solids, liquids and/or gases,<br>
has a number of applications in different industries. For example, in the pharmaceutical<br>
industry, different types of drugs are mixed together; in the medical field, body fluids (such as<br>
blood) and/or drugs are typical components that are mixed; and in the semiconductor field,<br>
wet solutions are combined with abrasives to make slurries. The food industry also<br>
incorporates mixing operations into a number of applications including rehydration. In these<br>
and other industries, the components to be mixed often require high levels of purity and/or<br>
sterility, such that expensive and time-consuming cleaning and/or sterilization operations are<br>
usually performed between batches in conventional mixing tanks to avoid contamination.<br>
[0004]	Bioprocessing applications such as cell culturing and fermentation present special<br>
challenges relative to many other mixing processes. Oxygen must be consistently supplied in<br>
solution (e.g., in water or another liquid) to cells or other micro-organisms. Oxygen is more<br>
readily dissolved in water with the aid of a mixing apparatus, but mixing should not be too<br>
aggressive to avoid damage to cells or micro-organisms contained in the bioprocessor.<br>
Economy would be promoted by processing with large batches, but oxygen dissolution (along<br>
with mixing in general) is less efficiently performed in large liquid volumes. Ensuring<br>
relatively even distribution of oxygen among the contents of a large volume can be<br>
challenging. Bioprocessing operations can require extremely long periods - such as on the<br>
order of a few days for fermentation, and up to 30 days or more for cell culture operations. In<br>
 <br>
most instances, it is desirable to maintain oxygen levels as economically as possible - with<br>
low energy consumption, and by the use of air rather than pure oxygen.<br>
[0005] Of the preceding criteria, the most important aspect of a bioreactor is the ability<br>
to transfer oxygen into solution (e.g., in water), to ensure a consistent oxygen supply and<br>
compensate for oxygen consumption of growing cells or micro-organisms. This may be<br>
expressed with the oxygen transfer rate MO2, in units of kilograms /hour utilizing the<br>
following formula:<br>
 <br>
Where:<br>
v =	volume of the liquid (1)<br>
C*O2 =	concentration of O2 at saturation (a function of Temperature and<br>
Product)<br>
C02 =	actual concentration of 02 dissolved in the liquid (a function of O2 %<br>
in the gas)<br>
Kla =	a constant (expressed in units of per hour) that is linked to the system<br>
(a function of mixing speed, tank design, turbulence, and thus the<br>
total surface of gas in the liquid at a given time).<br>
For a fixed gas flow, the value of Kla determines whether a system is suitable for applications<br>
such as cell culture or fermentation. Cell culture generally requires a Kla value from about 15<br>
to about 40 / hour, whereas fermentation generally requires a Kla value of approximately 300.<br>
[0006] To determine the Kla value of a system, various parameters (such as water<br>
volume, air flow, temperature, drum shape, mixing speed, etc.) are fixed. Then the liquid is<br>
purged with nitrogen to let the saturation drop to zero percent. Once this zero percent oxygen<br>
state is established, the nitrogen is replaced by air (t=0). After a certain time the oxygen<br>
transfer rate will assume a linear rise approximately 95% saturation. Referring to FIG. 1, this<br>
rise starts at about T=1.5 minutes and continues until about T=2.5 minutes. The scope of this<br>
linear rise is the value of Kla (in units of 1/hour).<br>
[0007] Traditional bioreactors include stainless steel tanks having components for<br>
introducing air into the contents of the tank. In tanks intended for cell culture applications, air<br>
is typically introduced through a small perforated pipe (e.g., having holes of approximately 20<br>
micrometers in diameter). Mixing with an agitator is performed gently to avoid damage to the<br>
cells. In tanks intended for fermentation applications, air can be introduced through a smaller<br>
 <br>
number of openings (e.g., 3 in number) of approximately 1 millimeter in diameter positioned<br>
at the bottom (and/or along the lower sides) of the tank below high speed turbine agitators<br>
used to break air bubbles into smaller fragments, thus increasing the total gas surface to aid<br>
dissolution of air into the liquid within the tank. For liquid volumes of 100 liters, typical air<br>
flows are on the order of 2 liters per minute for cell culture and 150 liters per minute for<br>
fermentation. Increases in liquid volume have concomitantly increased air volumes.<br>
[0008]	Due to multiple advantages (such as elimination of inter-batch carryover or<br>
contamination, and elimination of inter-batch cleaning and/or sterilization operations)<br>
disposable containers are becoming increasingly useful in many industrial applications,<br>
including mixing applications. For example, a mixing apparatus employing a disposable and<br>
flexible mixing tank having a mixing paddle adapted to travel within the tank is disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0078552, which is commonly assigned with the<br>
present application to Advanced Technology Materials, Inc. (Danbury, Connecticut, USA).<br>
Such publication discloses tanks of various shapes, including cylindrical tanks. One difficulty<br>
associated with attempting to use such a cylindrical tanks in bioprocessing applications is<br>
illustrated in connection with FIGS. 3A-3B. At a certain continuous rotation speed, bulk<br>
liquid within the tank 101 will exhibit a nearly laminar flow behavior, as depicted by<br>
streamlines 5. Around the area of the mixing paddle 110, proximate to the bottom 103 of the<br>
tank 101, sufficient turbulence exists (as depicted by turbulent mixing regions 6) since the<br>
speed of the paddle 110 is higher than the liquid through which it travels. But in other<br>
locations within the tank 101, mainly toward the upper sides of the tank, the liquid will be<br>
rotated at a constant speed, and with little to no turbulence. In such regions with substantially<br>
laminar streamlines 5, the mixing uniformity may be poor. In bioprocessing applications,<br>
when gas bubbles are introduced from the bottom of the tank 101 for dissolution into the<br>
liquid, the speed of achieving oxygen saturation and/or the level of peak oxygen saturation<br>
may be insufficient using the cylindrical tank 101. In the case of mixing solids (e.g.,<br>
powders) into liquids, in certain circumstances (e.g., at certain speeds) the observable effect<br>
more closely resembles centrifugation rather than mixing, causing substances (e.g., powders)<br>
intended to be mixed to concentrate along the wall of the tank 101 rather than forming a<br>
uniform mixture.<br>
[0009]	Disposable bioreactor systems have recently become available from<br>
manufacturers such as Hyclone (Logan, Utah, USA), Wave Biotech (Somerset, New Jersey,<br>
USA), and Applikon Biotechnology (Schiedam, Netherlands). These systems, however, are<br>
intended for cell culture applications and typically have maximum Kla values of around 20.<br>
Such systems are generally unsuitable for fermentation use. It would be desirable to provide<br>
 <br>
bioreactor systems adapted for disposable use and permitting very high Kla values to be<br>
attained.<br>
[0010] One challenge associated with providing a disposable bioreactor vessel is<br>
providing interfaces to various types of sensors, such as may be useful to monitor<br>
temperature, carbon dioxide, pH, or other desirable parameters. Particularly in vessels<br>
involving large batch volumes and/or in applications involving rapid reactions, measurable<br>
parameters may be subject to local variation. A similar problem is encountered with respect<br>
to material extraction (e.g. for sampling) or material addition, as variations in local material<br>
composition or other properties may vary from one location to another within a vessel.<br>
[0011] Another challenge associated with providing a disposable bioreactor vessel is<br>
providing temperature control for contents of the vessel. The problem is particularly<br>
challenging with large volume vessels adapted to process large batches. A desirable<br>
disposable vessel would permit filling, mixing, emptying, and monitoring operations while<br>
keeping the contents at, or bringing the contents to, a desired temperature, while rninimizing<br>
the need for thermal control components to be cleaned and/or sterilized between batches.<br>
[0012] Furthermore, if when it is desired to provide direct contact between a probe and<br>
the fluid contents of a disposable vessel, it may be difficult to do so while avoiding leaks or<br>
otherwise compromising the structural integrity of the vessel.<br>
[0013] Thus, there exists a need for improved mixing and bioreactor systems to address<br>
one or more of the above-mentioned difficulties. Desirable systems would include disposable<br>
elements to avoid or minimize the need for cleaning and sterilization between batches.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION. AND PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS THEREOF<br>
[0067]	The following patent disclosures applications are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in the present application as if set forth herein: International Patent Application No.<br>
PCT/US07/67163 filed on April 21, 2007 and entitled "SYSTEMS AND DEVICES FOR<br>
MIXING SUBSTANCES AND METHODS OF MAKING SAME;" U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2005/0078552 entitled "FLEXIBLE MIXING BAG FOR MIXING SOLIDS,<br>
LIQUIDS AND GASES;" and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0233779<br>
entitled "FLEXIBLE MIXING BAG FOR MIXING SOLIDS, LIQUIDS AND GASES;" all<br>
of which are commonly assigned to the assignee of the present application.<br>
[0068] The present invention encompasses apparatuses for mixing and/or reacting<br>
substances having the potential to reduce labor, lower production costs, and improve product<br>
quality in bioreactor and fermenter applications. Certain embodiments permit a flexible and<br>
disposable material processing tank, which may be embodied as bag constructed of polymeric<br>
film, to replace permanent mixing tanks for use in various applications, thus eliminating<br>
cleaning, sterilization, and product contamination concerns. The resulting apparatus may<br>
comprise a disposable bioreactor or fermenter.<br>
[0069]	Various embodiments of the present invention utilize a mixing paddle disposed<br>
and adapted to travel within the interior of the tank, the paddle being adapted to engage a<br>
support rod mechanically coupleable to receive kinetic energy from a kinetic energy source,<br>
preferably including a motor, but alternatively possibly including one or more servos, pistons,<br>
solenoids, linear or rotary actuators, or the like. A paddle preferably includes at least one<br>
widened portion that is wider than a nominal diameter or cross-sectional width of an<br>
associated support rod. Multiple widened portions may be provided with a single paddle. A<br>
paddle may further include a narrowed portion, and/or a support rod may be integrally formed<br>
with or joined to a paddle. If a sleeve is provided around the mixing paddle, such sleeve may<br>
conform closely to the size and shape of the paddle, such that the sleeve is substantially form-<br>
fitting around the paddle. The apparatus is preferably adapted to permit pivotal movement of<br>
the support rod between the kinetic energy source and the mixing tank.<br>
[0070] In one embodiment, a mixing or material processing apparatus is adapted to<br>
permit the paddle to travel within the tank through a closed curvilinear path without<br>
continuous rotation of the paddle about a longitudinal axis of the support rod. In such an<br>
embodiment, the paddle and support rod preferably sweep a substantially conical path within<br>
 <br>
the interior of the tank, with the position of the rod and paddle being at a nonzero angle<br>
relative to a central (e.g., vertical) axis of the tank. The curvilinear path may include circular<br>
and oval shapes. In another embodiment, the apparatus is adapted to permit the paddle to<br>
(reversibly) translate within the tank in a path that is substantially linear in one dimension<br>
(e.g., as viewed from above), again without continuous rotation of the paddle about a<br>
longitudinal axis of the support rod. Such paddle-based non-rotary mixing is gentler than the<br>
rotary (shear) mixing effected by a conventional impeller, particularly where large-diameter<br>
impellers are used (e.g., in large vessels) since the tip speed of an impeller can become quite<br>
high.<br>
[0071] The paddle may be disposed within a flexible integral sleeve that serves as an<br>
isolation barrier between the paddle and the interior of the tank. In one embodiment, the<br>
mixing tank and sleeve are made of any suitable material having a property where upon<br>
removal of an extending force, it is capable of substantially recovering its original size and<br>
shape and/or exhibits a significant retractive force. As such, the mixing tank and sleeve may<br>
be made of any suitable type of stretchable, collapsible, pliable and/or elastic material. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, a disposable mixing tank is manufactured from a substantially or fully<br>
transparent film to allow for visual inspection of the tank's contents before and after use. In<br>
this regard, the tank may be embodied in a bag. The tank and sleeve may comprise the same<br>
materials.<br>
[0072] A mixing tank and sleeve may be manufactured from any suitable material.<br>
Suitable materials include, e.g., films, polymers, thermoplastic polymers, homopolymers,<br>
copolymers, block copolymers, graft copolymers, random copolymers, alternating<br>
copolymers, terpolymers, metallocene polymers, nonwoven fabric, spunbonded fibers,<br>
meltblown fibers, polycellulose fibers, polyester fibers, polyurethane fibers, polyolefin fibers,<br>
polyamide fibers, cotton fibers, copolyester fibers, open cell foam, polyurethane, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polyethylene, metals, alloys, fiberglass, glass, plastic (e.g., polyethylene (PE),<br>
polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephtalate (PET),<br>
polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyfluoroalkoxy<br>
(PFA) derivates thereof), rubber, and combinations or mixtures thereof. A mixing tank may<br>
or may not be flexible in character. A sleeve, which defines a cavity for receiving at least a<br>
portion of a mixing paddle, should be flexible to permit substantially unrestricted movement<br>
of the mixing paddle disposed therein. If provided, the sleeve serves as an isolation barrier<br>
between the mixing paddle and the interior of the tank.<br>
 <br>
[0073] In one embodiment, a film material useable for a tank and/or sleeve comprises a<br>
multilayer laminate structure. A plurality of layers of different materials may be laminated<br>
together to provide a desired function. One or more gas barrier layers formed of a material<br>
such as ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) may be included. Tie layers may be provided<br>
between different materials. One or more air gaps having unbonded regions may be provided<br>
in a multilayer or composite film. A preferred multilayer laminate includes a polyamide outer<br>
layer, a first tie layer, a polyethylene or polyethylene blend/copolymer layer, a second tie<br>
layer, an EVOH (gas barrier) layer, a third tie layer, another polyethylene or polyethylene<br>
blend/copolymer layer, an air gap, and then an inner contact layer comprising another<br>
polyethylene or polyethylene blend/copolymer layer. Multiple gas barrier layers may be<br>
provided. Another desirable multilayer structure includes a polyamide outer layer, a tie layer,<br>
a polyethylene or polyethylene-based layer, a tie layer, a first gas barrier (e.g., EVOH) layer,<br>
a tie layer, a second gas barrier (e.g., EVOH) layer, a tie layer, a polyethylene or<br>
polyethylene-based layer, an air gap, and another polyethylene or polyethylene-based layer<br>
along the (e.g., inner) surface intended to contact materials to be processed within the<br>
resulting tank.<br>
[0074] A flexible tank may be disposed substantially within a support container, which<br>
may be manufactured from any suitable material. Rigid materials are preferred for at least a<br>
portion of the support container to confer structural integrity. If a support container includes<br>
an inflatable baffle, such as provided in the form of an inflatable bladder, then flexible<br>
materials are preferably used for at least an inner portion (such as an inner wall) of the<br>
support container as appropriate to permit the bladder to expand or contract as necessary. A<br>
support container may have an open top to permit easy access to the mixing mechanism and<br>
fluid connections disposed atop a mixing tank.<br>
[0075] As used herein, the term "film" refers to a polymeric films, including for<br>
example, multilayer polymeric films and thermoplastic film made using a film extrusion<br>
and/or foaming process, such as a cast film or blown film extrusion process. For the purposes<br>
of the present invention, the term includes nonporous films as well as microporous films.<br>
Films may be vapor permeable or vapor impermeable, and function as liquid barriers and/or<br>
gas barriers under normal use conditions.<br>
[0076] As used herein, the term "polymers" includes, but is not limited to,<br>
homopolymers, copolymers, such as for example, block, graft, random and alternating<br>
copolymers, terpolymers, etc. and blends and modifications thereof. Furthermore, unless<br>
 <br>
otherwise specifically limited, the term "polymer" shall include all possible geometrical<br>
configurations of the material. These configurations include, but are not limited to, isotactic,<br>
syndiotactic and atactic symmetries.<br>
[0077] References in the specification to "one embodiment", "an embodiment", "an<br>
example embodiment", etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular<br>
feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment need not necessarily include the<br>
particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily<br>
referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or<br>
characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within<br>
the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in<br>
connection with other embodiments, whether or not explicitly described.<br>
[0078] Embodiments of the invention may include features, methods or processes<br>
embodied within machine-executable instructions provided by a machine-readable medium.<br>
A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism, which provides (i.e., stores and/or<br>
transmits) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, a network device,<br>
a personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more<br>
processors, etc.). In an exemplary embodiment, a machine-readable medium includes volatile<br>
and/or non-volatile media (e.g., read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM);<br>
magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; etc.), as well as<br>
electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared<br>
signals, digital signals, etc.).<br>
[0079] Such instructions are utilized to cause a general or special purpose processor,<br>
programmed with the instructions, to perform methods or processes of the embodiments of<br>
the invention. Alternatively, the features or operations of embodiments of the invention are<br>
performed by specific hardware components, which contain hard-wired logic for performing<br>
the operations, or by any combination of programmed data processing components and<br>
specific hardware components. Embodiments of the invention may be implemented with or<br>
include software, data processing hardware, data processing system-implemented methods,<br>
and various processing operations, further described herein.<br>
[0080] Preferred mixing or material processing tanks comprise flexible materials, such as<br>
to permit the tank to conform to the inner surface of an external support container. The tank<br>
may be manufactured from pyrogen free, sterile materials, to reduce risks associated with<br>
 <br>
cross contamination. The flexible tank may comprise one or more ports for filling, spiking,<br>
aerating, adding and/or draining components to reduce the amount of human contact with the<br>
various components (which may be hazardous, dangerous and/or infectious) that are to be<br>
mixed as part of and during the mixing of such components.<br>
[0081]	Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, a detailed implementation of a mixing system 100<br>
including a mixing tank 101 is shown. While illustrated as generally cylindrical in shape, the<br>
shape of the mixing tank 101 is not so limited, as tanks of various shapes (e.g., parallelepiped)<br>
may be provided. The mixing tank lOlhas a top wall 104 defining a substance inlet 160 and<br>
access ports 180, 185, and has a bottom wall 103 defining an outlet or drain 170, which may<br>
alternately be used to supply gas (e.g., air or oxygen) bubbles to the tank 101. The tank 101<br>
further includes a sealed sleeve 140 joined to the tank 101 along a reinforced coupling guide<br>
105. The coupling guide 105 defines an aperture that permits pivotal movement of the shaft<br>
30. The sealed sleeve 140 contains a mixing paddle 110 that is joined to a hollow shaft 130.<br>
Adjacent to the coupling guide 105 is a pivot guide 15 (e.g., having a perforated pivot ball)<br>
through which an intermediate transfer shaft 30 extends to engage (e.g., by insertion) the<br>
hollow shaft 130 disposed below. The transfer shaft 30 is linked to a radially offset coupling<br>
12 including an upper link 12A and a lower link 12B that engage the output shaft 11 of a<br>
motor 99. Preferably, the coupling links 12A-12B includes bearings or other rotatable<br>
support means to permit the shafts 30, 140 not to rotate about their own axes despite being<br>
driven through a substantially circular path at a nonzero angle relative to a central vertical<br>
axis of the mixing tank 101 (e.g., such as vertical axis 140 illustrated in FIG. 3B). This<br>
permits the transfer of kinetic energy from the motor 99 to the paddle 110 without continuous<br>
degree rotation of the shafts 30,140. Such movement without axial rotation of the shafts 30,<br>
130 ensures that the sleeve 140, which is sealed (e.g., welded) to the tank 101, does not twist<br>
or tear, or bind the paddle 110. The motor 99 is supported by a support frame 8, with an<br>
extension 9 thereof further supporting the pivot guide 15. If desired, such pivot guide 15 may<br>
be eliminated in view of the dual offset links 12A, 12B. Preferably, the support frame 8<br>
further engages the mixing tank 101 to ensure correct positioning between the motor 99, the<br>
transfer shaft 30, and the contents of the sleeve 140.<br>
[0082] FIG. 2B shows the sealed sleeve 140 and mixing paddle 110 in various positions<br>
of a 360° range of motion within the tank 101. The mixing paddle 110 travels in a large,<br>
closed curvilinear (e.g., substantially circular) path 113 in a plane parallel to the bottom<br>
surface 103 or base of the mixing tank 101. Simultaneously, the upper end of the transfer<br>
shaft 30 travels in a small, closed curvilinear (e.g., substantially circular) path 13 in a<br>
 <br>
similarly parallel plane, but disposed above the pivot guide 15. The paddle 110 accomplishes<br>
such travel without continuous rotation about a longitudinal axis of the shaft 30. Although the<br>
offset coupling 12 preferably includes a bearing to enable non-rotation of the rod 30, an anti-<br>
rotation rod 31 protruding from the shaft 30 above the pivot guide 15 is retrained between<br>
parallel guide bars 17 affirmatively prevents the rod 30 from rotating about its own<br>
longitudinal axis. The travel diameter of the paddle 110 may be modified by adjusting the<br>
width of the offset coupling 12, the lengths of the transfer shaft 30 and the hollow shaft 130,<br>
and the placement of the pivot guide 15 relative to the shafts 30, 130.<br>
[0083] While various embodiments discussed previously herein depict a mixing paddle<br>
disposed within a sleeve, it is to be appreciated that sleeveless embodiments are within the<br>
scope of the invention. In one embodiment shown in FIGS. 13A-13B, a mixing system 1001<br>
includes a mixing paddle 1010 and sleeveless shaft 1030 for use in a substantially sealed<br>
mixing tank 1001. The shaft 1030 is sealed to the tank 1001, whether permanently or<br>
removably. At least one wall of the tank 1001 preferably comprises a flexible material such<br>
as a polymeric film. Permanent joining between the shaft 1030 and tank 1001 may be<br>
performed by solvent welding or thermal welding (e.g., if the shaft comprises a polymeric<br>
material) along a joint 1009 or any other appropriate joining means. Removable joining<br>
between the shaft 1030 and tank 1001 may be performed, for example, using an optional<br>
clamp 1107 (such as illustrated in FIG. 14C).<br>
[0084] A reinforcing flange 1006 is provided along the top wall 1004 of the tank 1001 to<br>
receive the shaft 1030 and permit the establishment of the joint 1009, such as with a flat<br>
circular weld joint 1009. The flange 1006, which may be injection molded with the shaft<br>
1030, is preferably welded to the top wall 1004 as well. Following establishment of the joint<br>
1009, an upper portion 1030A of the shaft 1030 protrudes upward from the tank 1001 to mate<br>
with an appropriate mixing mechanism to move the mixing paddle 1040 within the tank.<br>
Since the joint 1009 is rigid, it does not permit the shaft 1030 to rotate about its own axis<br>
1030X. Instead, the shaft 1030 is permitted to move within the tank through a substantially<br>
circular path at a nonzero angle relative to a central vertical axis of the tank 1001. The paddle<br>
1040 is preferably permanently joined (e.g., by welding) to the shaft 1030 along a joint 1011;<br>
alternatively, the paddle 1040 and shaft 1030 may be integrally formed together such as with<br>
an injection molding process. The paddle 1040 and shaft 1030 preferably permanently joined<br>
to the tank 1001 and manufactured as a single unit and pre-sterilized to that the assembly<br>
1000 is adapted for economical single use (e.g., through the use of low-cost polymeric<br>
 <br>
materials) and subsequent disposal. Alternatively, other suitable materials may be used and<br>
the assembly 1000 may be cleaned and/or sterilized between uses if desired.<br>
[0085]	In one embodiment, at least one wall of the tank 1001 comprises a polymeric film<br>
that is preferably substantially optically transmissive or transparent, and the shaft 1030<br>
comprises a polymer adapted to be joined to the top wall 1004 by solvent and/or thermal<br>
welding. If desired, a substantially open external frame (not shown) permitting viewing of the<br>
tank may be provided to support the tank 1001 with associated hooks or connectors (not<br>
shown). The upper wall 1004 of the tank 1001 further defines a substance inlet port 1060 and<br>
additional apertures 1031, 1032 such as may also be used to admit substances or extract<br>
substances to or from the tank 1001. Each aperture or port 1031, 1032 preferably has an<br>
associated supply line 1033, 1034, sealing element 1035, 1036, and coupling element 1037,<br>
1038. The lower wall 1003 of the tank 1001 defines an outlet aperture or port 1072 preferably<br>
having an associated drain or outlet line 1074, sealing element 1076, and coupling element<br>
1078. In this manner, the tank 1001 may be joined to other elements of a processing system<br>
(not shown), and substances exchanged therebetween may be processed.<br>
[0086]	FIGS. 14A-14B illustrate another mixing assembly 1100 having a sleeveless<br>
shaft 1130 and mixing paddle 1140. The primary distinction between the assembly 1100 and<br>
the prior assembly 1000 illustrated in FIGS. 13A-13B is the connection between the top wall<br>
1104 of the tank 1101 and the shaft 1130. In the present assembly 1100, the shaft 1130 is<br>
coupled directly to the top wall 1104 without an interposing reinforcing flange 1006 (as<br>
shown in FIGS. 13A-13B). The top wall 1104 preferably comprises a flexible material such<br>
as polymeric film. The top wall material may be gathered around the shaft 1130 as shown in<br>
FIGS 14A-14B and then welded (e.g., circumferentially welded to the shaft) to form a joint<br>
1119, or optionally clamped using a clamp 1107 as illustrated in FIG. 14C to permit<br>
removable engagement between the shaft 1130 and the tank 1101. As before, the shaft 1130<br>
includes a protruding upper portion 1130A and an axis 1130X. Since the joint 1119 is rigid, it<br>
does not permit the shaft 1130 to rotate about its own axis 1130X. The mixing paddle 1140 is<br>
preferably permanently joined to the shaft 1130 along a joint 1111.<br>
[0087]	The upper wall 1104 of the tank 1101 further defines a substance inlet port 1160<br>
and additional apertures 1131, 1132 such as may also be used to admit or extract substances<br>
to or from the tank 1101. Each aperture or port 1131, 1132 preferably has an associated<br>
supply line 1133, 1134, sealing element 1135, 1136, and coupling element 1137, 1138. The<br>
 <br>
lower wall 1103 of the tank 1101 defines an outlet aperture or port 1172 preferably having an<br>
associated drain or outlet line 1174, sealing element 1176, and coupling element 1178.<br>
[0088] In a variation of the foregoing sleeveless mixing assemblies 1000, 1100, a shaft<br>
may be interfaced to a tank via a rotatable sealing bearing (not shown) such as comprising a<br>
ball and socket joint. If provided, such a sealing bearing may comprise low friction<br>
polymeric materials (e.g., polytetrafluoroetylene) along mating surfaces. Multiple seals may<br>
be provided to prevent tank leakage. Preferably, however, no moving parts (such as bearings)<br>
are provided in fluid communication with the interior of the mixing tank, to avoid any<br>
possibility of leakage or contamination. In this regard, the interior of a mixing tank of a<br>
material processing apparatus according to the present invention is preferably formed with<br>
welded seams that prevent slip or rotation between elements.<br>
[0089] Although the preceding embodiments have been directed primarily to apparatuses<br>
in which a paddle may be driven in a curvilinear (e.g., circular) path, in certain embodiments<br>
a paddle may be driven in a substantially linear manner (as viewed from above) to reversibly<br>
translate within a tank. As viewed from the side, the paddle moves back and forth along an<br>
arc. Referring to FIG. 15, a material processing apparatus 1200 includes a parallelepiped-<br>
shaped mixing tank 1201 having an internal paddle 1210 and associated support rod 1230<br>
arranged for pivotal movement between a kinetic energy source 1298 and the interior of the<br>
tank 1201. The kinetic energy source 1298 in this case may include a piston/cylinder,<br>
solenoid, or other linear actuator. Alternatively, a motor with appropriate linear conversion<br>
mechanism may be employed. A linkage 1232 is preferably provided between the support<br>
rod 1230 and the kinetic energy source 1298. A pivot element 1215 is preferably arranged<br>
between the kinetic energy source 1298 and the tank 1201, with both the pivot element 1215<br>
and the kinetic energy source 1298 being supported by a frame 1208. In operation, the paddle<br>
is reversibly driven in a linear manner along at least one dimension (e.g., as viewed from<br>
above) within the tank 1201. The paddle 1210, which may or may not be isolated within a<br>
sleeve (not shown), may be extremely wide relative to prior embodiments - even approaching<br>
the width of the tank - to provide enhanced mixing action.<br>
[0090] As noted previously in connection with FIGS. 3A-3B, attempts to use me<br>
cylindrical tank 101 with the system 100 in bioprocessing applications can provide<br>
suboptimal mixing performance, leading to slow oxygen saturation or incomplete mixing.<br>
 <br>
[0091] To address such problems, one or more inwardly-protruding baffles may be<br>
formed in or otherwise associated with a tank (e.g., the tank 101) in a system otherwise as<br>
illustrated and described in connection with FIGS. 2A-2B. Such baffles preferably protrude<br>
inward toward a substantially central axis of a tank (e.g., the axis 140 illustrated in FIG. 3B).<br>
In one embodiment, referring to FIGS. 5A-5B, baffles 252A-252D may be formed in a<br>
support container 250 adapted to receive a flexible mixing tank. The support container 250<br>
has a bottom 256, an open mouth 255, an inner surface 254A, and an outer surface 254B, and<br>
may further include casters 259 to provide mobility. While four baffles 252A-252D are<br>
shown, and preferred embodiments include between two and four baffles, fewer or additional<br>
baffles may be provided. The container 250 is preferably free-standing and fabricated at least<br>
in part of rigid materials to provide a suitable support structure for a disposable mixing tank.<br>
A flexible mixing tank (such as the tank 101 previously shown in FIGS. 2A or 3B), such as<br>
fabricated of a polymeric film material, may be inserted through the mourn 255 into the<br>
support container 250, with the flexible tank preferably sized to conform to the inner surface<br>
254A when contents to be mixed are supplied to the tank. In this manner, the baffles 252A-<br>
252D formed in the support container 250 protrude toward the interior of the flexible mixing<br>
tank. Thus, baffles may be added to (e.g., integrally formed on) the inner walls of support<br>
container to thereby form inwardly-protruding baffles in a mixing tank adapted to conform to<br>
the shape of the container, or in the alternative, baffles may be formed directly along the inner<br>
surface of a flexible tank. If desired, the support container 250 may include one or more<br>
apertures in the side wall 254B or the bottom 256 to enable various fluid lines (e.g., for<br>
supply or drainage) or sensors to be connected to the flexible tank, with corresponding<br>
apertures preferably provided in the corresponding tank.<br>
[0092] Other baffle configurations may be provided. For example, referring to FIGS.<br>
4A-4D, each tank (or support container) 201, 211, 221,231 includes two baffles 202A, 202B,<br>
212A, 212B, 222A, 222B, 232A, 232B, respectively. The size, shape, and number of baffles<br>
may be selected for the desired mixing application, and may be widely varied. For example,<br>
the baffles 202A, 202B illustrated in FIG. 4A are relatively small; the baffles 212A, 212B<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4B are relatively larger; the baffles 222A, 222B illustrated in FIG. 4C are<br>
sharply angled; and the baffles 232A, 232B illustrated in FIG. 4D are smoothly rounded.<br>
Each baffle is preferably disposed in a substantially vertical orientation along or abutting the<br>
inner periphery of the tank. Each tank or support container 201, 211, 221, 231 is preferably<br>
substantially cylindrical except for the inclusion of the baffles, although other shapes may be<br>
employed<br>
 <br>
[0093] The beneficial effect of the addition of baffles to a mixing tank and mixing<br>
system is apparent in FIGS. 6A-6B. FIG. 6A illustrates a top plan view of the mixing paddle<br>
of FIGS. 2A-2B combined with the mixing tank 211 of FIG. 4B in operation, with an<br>
external arrow depicting the direction of paddle travel, with longer internal arrows depicting<br>
bulk fluid motion, with short internal arrows 6 depicting turbulent mixing regions disposed<br>
adjacent to (e.g., behind) the mixing paddle 110, and with short internal arrows 7 depicting<br>
turbulent mixing regions adjacent to the baffles 212A, 212B. With the addition of the baffles<br>
212A, 212B to the tank 211, the motion of the mixing paddle 110 at a nonzero angle relative<br>
to the substantially central vertical axis 240 of the tank 211 yields substantially better mixing<br>
over a broader range of conditions than the tank 101 illustrated in FIG. 3B. This is<br>
particularly advantageous in bioprocessing applications where it is desired to achieve rapid<br>
oxygen saturation in a liquid such as water, and/or to maintain relatively high levels of<br>
oxygen saturation despite the presence of oxygen-consuming biological moieties.<br>
[0094] In one embodiment, either a tank or support container may include inwardly-<br>
protruding baffles that are inflatable. If provided in a support container, the container<br>
preferably has a rigid outer wall to provide structural integrity and has a flexible inner wall to<br>
permit the baffles to expand inwardly. Each baffle preferably includes an inflatable bladder<br>
in fluid communication with an external source of pressurized fluid (not shown) that permits<br>
the baffle to be expanded to the desired volume. FIGS. 7A-7C illustrate a mixing tank 301<br>
(or support container adapted to receive a mixing tank) having three baffles 302A-302C in<br>
three states of operation. An inflation inlet 305 is provided in at least intermittent fluid<br>
communication with the baffle bladders. In FIG. 7A, the baffles are in a first, uninflated<br>
state. In FIG. 7B, the baffles are in a second, partially inflated state. In FIG. 7C, the baffles<br>
are in a third, fully inflated state. In this manner, baffles may be deployed at any appropriate<br>
time and/or to any appropriate extent in conjunction with a mixing operation to achieve a<br>
desired mixing effect.<br>
[0095] If desired, baffle-containing tanks as provided herein may be used in conjunction<br>
with non-paddle-based mixing elements known in the art. Impellers, stirbars, and other<br>
known mixing elements may be employed in appropriate applications.<br>
[0096] While the preceding embodiments have focused on cylindrical tanks, is to be<br>
appreciated that the invention is not so limited. Other desirable shapes, including<br>
parallelepiped (inclusive of rectangular, cubic, and other forms) shaped tanks, may be used in<br>
conjunction with mixing paddles and optional sleeves as described previously. Cylindrical<br>
 <br>
tanks have been commonly used in bioprocessing applications to permit a wide operating<br>
pressure range by avoiding stress concentration regions (i.e., corners), and to provide<br>
favorable height/width ratios to promote oxygen transfer from a bottom-mounted sparger to<br>
the contents of the tank. Parallelepiped-shaped tanks may be desirably fabricated with multi-<br>
layer sheets (with preferred multi-layer laminates being described below), such as by welding<br>
sheets along edges thereof, to enable a wider operating pressure range. One or more barrier<br>
layers may be provided in such a multi-layer laminate.<br>
[0097] One example of a parallelepiped-shaped tank equipped with a paddle and sleeve<br>
is provided in FIG. 10. The tank 701 includes a top wall 704, a bottom wall 703, and side<br>
walls 705 joined along edges thereof, preferably with welded joints. A paddle 710 having an<br>
associated support rod 730 is disposed within an integral sleeve 740 that is affixed to any of<br>
the top wall 704 and a coupling guide 705, preferably by welding. The sleeve 740 may<br>
included an enlarged upper attachment portion 740 for mating with the top wall 704. The<br>
coupling guide 705 defines an aperture 705 sized to permit pivotal movement of the support<br>
rod 730 between the interior of the tank 701 and an external kinetic energy source (not<br>
shown). The support rod 730 may be hollow to permit the insertion of a transfer shaft (not<br>
shown) linkable to an external kinetic energy source (not shown). The support rod 730 may<br>
be integral with the paddle 710. The paddle 710 and sleeve 740 are adapted to travel within<br>
the tank 701, being pivotally suspended from the top wall 704 of the tank 701. For the sake<br>
of simplicity, elements such as any inlet port, outlet port, and drain, have been omitted from<br>
FIG. 10, but it is to be understood that any utilitarian structure in this regard may be added to<br>
the apparatus.<br>
[0098]	With the use of a paddle as described previously herein, certain advantages may<br>
be achieved through the use of processing tanks having non-cylindrical (e.g., parallelepiped)<br>
shape. As illustrated in FIG. 11, high turbulence regions are generated not only around the<br>
paddle as it travels within the tank, but also along the corners of the tank. That is, a generally<br>
circular flow pattern within the middle of the tank tends to cause multi-directional flow or<br>
turbulent regions along the corners. Such high turbulence regions tend to enhance mixing.<br>
Baffles as described previously may be further added as necessary or desired to achieve a<br>
particular mixing or flow distribution pattern.<br>
[0099] As mentioned previously, certain applications require the ability to transfer<br>
oxygen or other gases into solution. Certain embodiments include gas injection elements or<br>
spargers in fluid communication with the interior of a mixing tank, such as to the passage of<br>
 <br>
air or other gases into the tank. The term "sparger" refers to an element adapted to permit one<br>
fluid (typically a gas) to be injected, and preferably distributed, into another fluid (typically a<br>
liquid).<br>
[00100] A classical sparger includes a series of holes defined in a rigid tube. A high<br>
speed impeller is typically placed over such a sparger. Relatively large bubbles released from<br>
the sparger are cut or dispersed into smaller bubbles by the impeller. High speed impellers,<br>
however, are unsuitable for certain bioreactor or fermenter applications, as they can damage<br>
materials to be processed, and further present risk of leakage or contamination adjacent to<br>
rotatable seals. Even if an impeller is omitted in favor of using a sparger with (conventional-<br>
scale) small holes, the diameter, amount, and homogeneity of gas bubbles formed are<br>
typically not optimal for use in bioreactor or fermenter systems to provide maximum cell<br>
production and/or protein yield.<br>
[00101] A sparger as employed in embodiments of the present invention may include a<br>
perforated or porous material, such as a perforated or porous tube, a perforated or porous film,<br>
or the like. To overcome limitations associated with classical spargers, spargers used with the<br>
present invention preferably comprise microporous or micro-perforated materials, obviating<br>
the need for use of any associated high speed impeller to generate small bubbles. Small<br>
bubbles are desirable to enhance mass transport of oxygen into solution within a material<br>
processing apparatus. A microporous or micro-perforated material useful with apparatuses<br>
according to the present invention has a plurality of gas passages or openings, with such<br>
openings having an average diameter of preferably less than or equal to 200 µ, more<br>
preferably less than or equal to 100 p, still more preferably less than or equal to 50 u, and<br>
even more preferably less than or equal to 20 p. In certain applications, it may be desirable to<br>
provide such material with openings having an average diameter of less than or equal to about<br>
10 p. Examples of porous materials useable in spargers according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention include sheets or tubes of nonwoven, spunbonded polymeric materials,<br>
sheets or tubes of sintered polymeric materials, and stretched (including dry-stretched and<br>
wet- or solvent-stretched) polymeric films. Porous materials sold under the trade names<br>
Tyvek® (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, Delaware USA) and Porex® (Porex<br>
Corp., Fairburn, Georgia USA) may be used. Preferred perforated materials are preferably<br>
formed by laser drilling (e.g., with a CO2 laser), which drilling is capable of reproducibly<br>
defining openings at diameters at least as small as 10 p. Such porous or perforated material<br>
may be in sheet form, tubular form, or any other suitable shape. Such material may be<br>
hydrophobic or hydrophilic in nature, and selected for such property depending on the desired<br>
 <br>
application. While various polymeric materials may be used, polyethylene is particularly<br>
desirable for its inert character.<br>
[00102] Spargers comprising microporous or microperforated materials may be placed in<br>
various locations within a fluid processing tank. In addition to the use of microporous or<br>
microperforated materials, other means for injecting gas into a liquid may be employed in<br>
certain embodiments. Gas injection elements may be disposed along the bottom of a mixing<br>
tank, along the sides of a mixing tank, along a mixing paddle, or from various combinations<br>
of such locations.<br>
[00103] Referring to FIGS. 8A-8B, a mixing tank according to one embodiment includes<br>
a double bottom comprising a first perforated or porous material layer 403A disposed over a<br>
second impermeable material (or bottom) 403 in communication with an air or gas inlet port<br>
480. The perforated or porous layer 403A which is preferably comprises a microperforated or<br>
microporous material as described previously, is joined to the bottom 403 along the inner<br>
surface 401A of the tank 401, and along the drain outlet 470 to form an annular pocket 403B.<br>
The mixing tank 401 further includes a top 404, coupling guide 405, and a mixing paddle 410<br>
and shaft 430 disposed in a sealed sleeve 440. The mixing paddle 410 is preferably adapted<br>
to travel in a substantially circular path at a nonzero angle relative to a central vertical axis<br>
(not shown) of the mixing tank 401. In operation, pressurized air or another desired gas is<br>
supplied via an inlet tube 481 through the inlet port 480 into the annular pocket 403B, where<br>
it escapes through holes defined in the perforated or porous layer 403A into the interior of the<br>
tank 401. In this manner, the passage of air into the tank is widely dispersed as small bubbles<br>
without requiring the use of high speed turbine agitators. Preferably, the pocket 403B is<br>
maintained at a higher pressure than any portion of the interior of the tank 401 to minimize or<br>
eliminate leakage from the tank into the pocket 403B.<br>
[00104] In another embodiment, referring to FIG. 9A, a mixing tank 501 may include an<br>
internal air distribution manifold or sparger 590 in fluid communication with an external air<br>
or gas source (not shown) via an air or gas inlet 580. The sparger 590 may be assembled from<br>
elbow fittings 591, peripheral perforated tubes 592, Y-fittings 593, and central perforated<br>
tubes 594, which permit air to be injected along the bottom of the tank 501 in a dispersed<br>
manner as small bubbles without requiring the use of high speed turbine agitators (impellers),<br>
Microperforated or microporous tubes may be used in place of the tubes 592, 594.<br>
Preferably, the sparger 590 is maintained at a higher pressure than any portion of the interior<br>
of the tank 501 to minimize or eliminate leakage from the tank into the sparger 590. Three<br>
 <br>
anchors 582, 584, 586, not requiring external fluidic connections, may be provided to secure<br>
the sparger 590 to the tank 501. Alternatively, gas inlets 582, 584, 586 may be substituted for<br>
the anchors if desired to aid in gas distribution and/or permit multiple gases to be mixed in the<br>
sparger 590 and supplied to the tank 501. The mixing tank 501 further includes a top 504,<br>
coupling guide 505, and a mixing paddle 510 and shaft 530 disposed in a sealed sleeve 550<br>
and adapted to travel within the tank 501. While not shown in FIG. 9A, a tank 501 would<br>
desirably include one or more additional inlet and outlet connections of various types, such as<br>
to permit the addition or removal of various substances and/or enable sensors to be provided<br>
in sensory communication with the interior of the tank 501.<br>
[00105] FIG. 9B illustrates the bottom wall 603 and air manifold or sparger portions of a<br>
mixing tank similar to the tank depicted in FIG. 9A. The manifold or sparger 690, which is<br>
preferably in fluid communication with an external air or gas source (not shown) via an inlet<br>
port 680, may be assembled from elbow fittings 691, peripheral perforated or porous<br>
(preferably microperforated or microporous) tubes 692, Y-fittings 693, and central perforated<br>
or porous tubes 694. The sparger 690 preferably is further secured to the bottom wall via<br>
anchors 682, 684, 686; however, in an alternative embodiment, gas inlets may be substituted<br>
for any one or more of the anchors 682, 684, 686 to further aid in promoting even gas<br>
distribution to the manifold and/or to supply various different gases to the sparger 690 for<br>
mixing therein. The bottom wall 603 further includes various ports 671A-671D and 672A-<br>
672D to permit communication with various fluid supply or drain lines, filters, sensors, and/or<br>
sample receptacles (e.g., bags).<br>
[00106] FIG. 9C illustrates the bottom wall 656 of a support container (such as the<br>
container 250 illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5B) adapted for use with a mixing tank having the<br>
bottom wall 603 illustrated in FIG. 9B. In particular, the container bottom wall 656 defines<br>
various apertures 660, 651-654 to permit access to the various ports 670, 671A-671D, 672A-<br>
672D, 680 of the tank bottom wall 603 of FIG. 9A, while still providing structural support for<br>
a flexible tank.<br>
[00107] Spargers (e.g., fixed spargers) of various sizes and shapes may be disposed in any<br>
of various locations along the bottom or side walls of a mixing vessel. Examples of possible<br>
sparger placement in this regard are illustrated in connection with the processing system 900A<br>
of FIG. 12. Such system 900A includes multiple rods 930A, 930B each having at least one<br>
associated mixing paddle 910A, 910B adapted to move within a common closed tank 901A.<br>
A benefit of using multiple mixing paddles 910A, 910B is that they can promote uniform<br>
 <br>
mixing in very large volume tanks. The tank 901A, which is generally parallelepiped-shaped,<br>
has a top wall 904A defining a substance inlet 960A and access ports 980A, 985A, and has a<br>
bottom wall 903A defining an outlet or drain 970A. The tank 901A further includes two<br>
sealed sleeves 940A, 940B joined to the tank 901A along reinforced coupling guides 905A,<br>
905B. Each sealed sleeve 940A, 940B contains a mixing paddle 910A, 910B joined to a<br>
hollow shaft 930A, 930B. Adjacent to each coupling guide 905A, 905B is a pivot guide<br>
815A, 815B (e.g., having a perforated pivot ball) through which a transfer shafts 830A, 830B<br>
extend to engage (e.g., by insertion) the hollow shafts 930A, 930B disposed below. (While<br>
hollow shafts 930A, 930B, separate transfer shafts 830A, 830B, and bottom-insert or pre-<br>
sealed mixing paddles 810A, 910B are shown, unitary shafts and/or top-insert mixing paddles<br>
may be used if desired.) Each transfer shaft 830A, 830B is linked to a radially offset coupling<br>
812A, 812B that engages the output shaft 811A, 811B of a motor 899A, 899B. While two<br>
motors 899A, 899B are shown and represent a preferred embodiment, one motor could be<br>
used in combination with a gearset or other appropriate linkage (not shown) to drive two or<br>
more paddles if desired. Each motor 899A, 899B is supported by a support frame 808A, with<br>
extensions 809A, 809B thereof further supporting the pivot guides 815A, 815B. Preferably,<br>
the support frame 808A further engages the mixing tank 901A to ensure correct positioning<br>
between the motors 899A, 899B, the transfer shafts 830A, 830B and the contents of the<br>
sleeves 940A-940B.<br>
[00108] One sparger or multiple spargers 990A-990D may be disposed along bottom wall<br>
903, and one of more spargers 995A-995D may be disposed along side walls 901A, of the<br>
tank 901. Each sparger 990A-990D, 995A-995D may include a section of microporous or<br>
microperforated tubular or sheet material. A tubular material may be added to an existing<br>
pipe nipple or other tube and then capped along one end. Each sparger 990A-990D, 995A-<br>
995D is preferably in fluid communication with an external gas source (not shown). A flow<br>
control element such as a valve (not shown) is preferably provided between a sparger 990A-<br>
990D, 995A-995D and a gas source.<br>
[00109] To provide enhanced mass transfer, a sparger may be adapted to travel with a<br>
mixing paddle in further embodiments of the present invention, such as illustrated in FIG. 16.<br>
Such figure illustrates a perspective view of a mixing apparatus 1300 including a<br>
parallelepiped-shaped mixing tank 1301 having an integral sleeve 1340 with a mixing paddle<br>
1310 disposed therein, with a sparger 1375 arranged to travel with the paddle 1310 and<br>
supply gas to the interior of the tank 1301. A support rod 1330 is linked to the paddle 1310<br>
within the sleeve 1340. Near the paddle 1310, the sparger 1375 is provided outside the sleeve<br>
 <br>
1340 to enable fluid communication with the contents of the tank 1301. A gas supply conduit<br>
1365 in fluid communication with the sparger 1375 may be disposed within the sleeve 1340.<br>
As illustrated, the sparger 1375 comprises a microporous or microperforated tubular material.<br>
End caps 1374, 1375 may be provided along the ends of the tubular material. A conduit<br>
segment 1368 supports the sparger 1375 outside the sleeve 1340 and provides fluid<br>
communication with the gas supply conduit 1365. A second conduit segment 1366 may be<br>
provided along the other end of the sparger 1375, but such segment 1366 need not be in fluid<br>
communication with the sparger 1375. Because the paddle 1310 does not rotate continuously<br>
about a longitudinal axis of the support rod 1330, there is no danger of twisting the gas supply<br>
conduit 1365 to the point of failure. The tank 1301 further includes a coupling guide 1305<br>
(that is preferably more rigid than a film material with which the tank is preferably<br>
constructed) that permits pivotal arrangement of the support rod 1330 between an external<br>
kinetic energy source (not shown) and the interior of the tank 1301. Ports 1360, 1362 may be<br>
provided along an upper surface of the tank 1301.<br>
[00110] Positioning the sparger to travel with the mixing paddle has been found to be<br>
advantageous in terms of greatly enhancing Kla. While applicants do not wish to be bound by<br>
any theory for such phenomenon, it is believed that generation of turbulent regions by the<br>
paddle as it travels through the tank increased dispersion of gas bubbles into liquid contents of<br>
the tank. Various possible configurations for supporting a sparger to travel with a paddle<br>
within a mixing tank are illustrated in FIGS. 17A-17F.<br>
[00111] FIG. 17A illustrates a portion of a material processing apparatus, including a<br>
paddle-containing sleeve 1440A and a sparger element 1475A supported by two conduit<br>
segments 1466A, 1468A. At least the first segment 1466A is in fluid communication with the<br>
gas supply conduit 1465A to supply gas to the sparger element 1475A. First and second<br>
fitments 1455A, 1456A are provided along a lower seam of the sleeve 144A to structurally<br>
interconnect the segments 1466A, 1468A and the sleeve 1440A while permitting gas flow<br>
into the segment 1466A from the gas supply conduit 1465 disposed within the sleeve 1440A.<br>
If desired, the segment 1466A may be a continuous extension of the gas supply conduit<br>
1465A; alternatively, any suitable hollow interconnect may be provided to connect such<br>
conduits 1466A, 1465A. A plug 1458A may be provided within the sleeve 1440A adjacent<br>
to the second fitment 1456A to plug the second segment 1468A, to ensure that any gas<br>
supplied to the sparger 1475A is released through the gas-permeable material. A welded<br>
seam 1441A is preferably made around the perimeter of the sleeve over the fitments 1455A,<br>
 <br>
1456A. The sleeve 1440A further contains a paddle 1410A and associated support rod<br>
1430A.<br>
[00112] Another embodiment is shown in FIG. 17B, which illustrates a paddle-containing<br>
sleeve 1440B with a sparger element 1475B supported by a single gas supply segment 1466B<br>
routed through a fitment 1455B and in fluid communication with a gas supply conduit 1465B.<br>
The sparger 1475B may be formed of a microporous or microperforated tube, with a distal<br>
end of the tube covered with a cap, plug, or microporous membrane (not shown). Depending<br>
on the rigidity of the conduit segment 1466B, the sparger 1475B may be substantially fixed in<br>
position relative to the paddle 1410B and sleeve 1440B, or the sparger 1475B may subject to<br>
some movement relative to the paddle 1410B or sleeve 1440B when the paddle 1410B and<br>
associated support rod 1430B are driven to travel within a mixing tank. The sleeve 1440B<br>
includes a peripheral seam 1441B that extends over the fitment 1455B and is preferably<br>
formed by welding.<br>
[00113] Another embodiment is shown in FIG. 17C, which illustrates a paddle-containing<br>
sleeve 1440C (and associated support rod 1430C) with a sparger element 1475C supported by<br>
a two conduit segments 1466C, 1468C routed through a single large fitment 1455C that<br>
permits fluid communication between the sparger 1475C and a gas supply conduit 1465C<br>
disposed within the sleeve 1440C. A plug 1458C may be provided within the sleeve 1440C<br>
adjacent to the fitment 1455C to plug the second segment 1468C, to ensure that any gas<br>
supplied to the sparger 1475C is released through the gas-permeable material thereof. The<br>
sleeve 1440C includes a peripheral seam 1441C that extends over the fitment 1455C and is<br>
preferably formed by welding. The first segment 1466C, or the first and second segments<br>
1466C, 1468C, may be a continuous extension of the gas supply conduit 1465C.<br>
[00114] As illustrated in FIGS. 17D-17E, the preceding sleeve-conduit fitments (i.e.,<br>
illustrated in connection with FIGS. 17A-17C) may be omitted, in favor of direct structural<br>
connection (e.g., welding) between a gas supply conduit 1465E and the sleeve material.<br>
Referring to FIG, 17D, sleeve 1440D containing a paddle 1410 and associated support rod<br>
1430D further contains a gas supply conduit 1465D that passes through a peripheral seam<br>
1441D to form conduit segment 1466D that supports a sparger 1475D. Such sparger 1475D<br>
is further supported by another conduit segment 1468D that passes back through the<br>
peripheral seam 1441D of the sleeve 1440D to receive a cap 1458D. The segments 1466D,<br>
1468D support the sparger 1475D from the sleeve 1440D.<br>
 <br>
[00115] FIG. 17E is substantially similar to FIG. 17D, but with the omission of the<br>
second conduit segment 1468D. Referring to FIG. 17E, a sleeve 1440E containing a paddle<br>
1410E and associated support rod 1430E further contains a gas supply conduit 1465E that<br>
passes through a peripheral seam 1441E to form conduit segment 1466E that supports a<br>
sparger 1475E. Gas supplied to the conduit 1465E passes through the conduit 1466E to the<br>
sparger 1475E to be released through the gas-permeable (e.g., microporous or<br>
microperforated) material thereof.<br>
[00116] While FIGS. 17A-17E illustrate a gas supply conduit routed through a paddle<br>
sleeve, it is to be appreciated that a gas supply conduit may be routed outside the sleeve to a<br>
wall of the tank, such as shown in FIG. 17F. In such an embodiment, the gas supply conduit<br>
extends through a wall of the tank to permit fluid communication with an external gas source<br>
(not shown) for supplying gas to the sparger. Again, because the paddle does not rotate<br>
continuously about a longitudinal axis of the support rod, there is no danger of twisting the<br>
gas supply conduit to the point of failure. Referring to FIG. 17F, a sleeve 1440F containing a<br>
paddle 1410F and associated support rod 1430F includes a fitment 1456F that receives a<br>
conduit segment 1468F attached to a sparger 1475. The conduit segment 1468F is preferably<br>
blocked or plugged to prevent passage of gas, to ensure than any gas supplied to the sparger<br>
1475F flows outwardly through the gas-permeable material thereof. Along an opposite end of<br>
the sparger 1475F, the sparger 1475F receives a gas supply conduit 1465F that preferably<br>
passes through a wall of a surrounding container (not shown). The gas supply conduit 1465F<br>
preferably has sufficient flexibility and slack not to impede travel of the paddle 1410F in<br>
operation. Gas supplied to the conduit 1465E passes to the sparger 1475D to be released<br>
through the gas-permeable (e.g., microporous or microperforated) material thereof.<br>
[00117] In certain embodiments, a sparger may be integrated with a sleeve or paddle, with<br>
a surface of such sleeve or paddle being formed of a porous or perforated (preferably<br>
microporous or microperforated) material and in fluid communication with an external gas<br>
source. One example of a sparger integrated with a sleeve is illustrated in FIGS. 18A-18B.<br>
A paddle 1510 and support rod 1530 are disposed within a sleeve 1540 that is preferably<br>
formed by welding sheets of a polymeric film material along peripheral edges thereof to form<br>
a cavity bounded by a peripheral seam 1541. Disposed along a portion of the sleeve 1540 is a<br>
sparger 1575 including a gas-permeable (preferably microporous or microperforated) material<br>
1575 in fluid communication with an external gas source (not shown) by way of a gas supply<br>
conduit 1565 routed through the sleeve 1540. The gas-permeable material 1575A material<br>
may comprise a membrane that is peripherally welded to the sleeve 1550. Referring to FIG.<br>
 <br>
18B, a hollow elbow 1578 including a flange portion 1578 and defining a gas flow passage<br>
1578A provides an interface between the gas supply conduit 1565 and the gas-permeable<br>
material 1575A. A flared or barbed connector 1579 may be provided along the elbow 1578 to<br>
facilitate connection to the gas supply conduit 1565. In operation, gas supplied through the<br>
gas supply conduit 1565 passes through the hollow elbow 1577 to the gas-permeable material<br>
1575A of the sparger 1575 and flows through holes defined therein into the interior of the<br>
tank to contact material to be processed.<br>
[00118] In further embodiments, other functional elements besides a sparger may be<br>
arranged to travel with a mixing paddle. Such functional element may be attached in whole<br>
or part to any of a paddle, a support rod, or sleeve. Functional elements may be integrated<br>
with a paddle and/or associated support rod (e.g., in a sleeveless embodiment) or with a sleeve<br>
(in embodiments where a sleeve is provided to isolate a paddle from contacting the interior of<br>
a tank). With respect to such an embodiment including a sleeve, FIG. 19 illustrates a mixing<br>
paddle 1610 and sleeve 1640 having a material addition conduit 1691, a material extraction<br>
conduit 1692 (e.g., for extracting periodic samples to be analyzed), and multiple sensors<br>
1681-1683, such as a temperature sensor 1681, a pH sensor 1682, and an oxygen sensor 1683.<br>
A sparger 1675 further provided in fluid communication with a gas supply conduit 1665<br>
passing through a fitment 1655 disposed along a peripheral seam 1641 of the sleeve 1640.<br>
Another example of a functional element that could be provided to travel with a mixing<br>
paddle is a heat exchange element (not shown), which may include an electrically driven heat<br>
exchange device (e.g., a resistance heater or thermoelectric device) or a circulating fluid<br>
communicable with an external heat source or sink. One or more electrical conductors or<br>
fluid conduits (e.g., for conducting a heat exchange fluid) may be associated with such heat<br>
exchange device. By arranging functional elements to travel with the mixing paddle 1610,<br>
substantial flow rates of fluid relative to the functional elements (e.g., elements 1675, 1681-<br>
1683, 1691,1692) are achieved. The motion and mixing action of the paddle tends to quickly<br>
eliminate local (positional) variation of fluid conditions.<br>
[00119] Each functional element may include an associated interface. For example, with<br>
continued reference to FIG. 19, the sparger has an associated gas supply tube 1665 (and<br>
fitment 1655), the material addition conduit may include a material addition segment passing<br>
through the seam 1641, the material extraction conduit may include a material distraction<br>
segment passing through the seam 1641, and the sensors 1681-1683, which are mounted to a<br>
receptacle 1680 (or fitment) may include one or more associated electrical conductors 1685.<br>
Such interface elements may be routed through the sleeve; alternatively, if a sleeve is not<br>
 <br>
provided, then such interface elements may be routed through or along the support rod,<br>
optionally disposed within a sheath (not shown). A plug or receptacle may be used any for<br>
each functional element or all functional elements to permit rapid connection and<br>
disconnection of desired components (e.g., spargers of different sizes, sensors of different<br>
types, heat exchangers of different capacity, etc.).<br>
[00120] In a further embodiment, one or more sensors may be adapted to communicate<br>
wirelessly with an isolated signal receiver or antenna. Such sensors may be self-powered,<br>
whether by battery or by rectifying an input signal to derive useable power. RFID technology<br>
may be used for wireless communication. In one embodiment, an interface element for a<br>
sensor includes any of a wireless transmitter and a wireless receiver. For example, a wireless<br>
transmitter may be placed in or along a paddle or sleeve in electrical communication with a<br>
receptacle (e.g., receptacle 1680) adapted to receive a sensor in fluid communication with the<br>
contents of a tank. Signals from such a sensor are communicated to the transmitter, which<br>
sends a signal to a remotely located receiver, which may be disposed outside a material<br>
processing tank.<br>
[00121]	Various components of a material processing system 1700 are shown in FIG.<br>
20. A tank-mounted mixing paddle 1710, support rod 1730, and optional sleeve 1740 may<br>
include any of various functional elements described herein. For example, a sparger 1775 is<br>
arranged to travel with the paddle 1710, and is in fluid communication with a gas supply<br>
conduit 1765 that is preferably routed through the sleeve 1740. A wireless transmitter 1751<br>
may be associated with the paddle 1710 or sleeve 1740. A signal receiver 1752 may be<br>
disposed remotely, such as outside the tank 1701, to receive signals from the wireless<br>
transmitter 1751. The wireless transmitter 1751 may be adapted to receive signals from one<br>
or multiple sensors (not shown) adapted to travel with the paddle 1710 within the tank 1701.<br>
Proximate to the tank 1701 are various appurtenant elements including a kinetic energy<br>
source 1799 adapted to drive the mixing paddle 1710, a gas source 1766 adapted to supply<br>
gas to the sparger 1775, material extraction and/or addition components 1793 (which may<br>
include various flow control elements, material containers, and the like) with an optional<br>
analyzer 1794 (e.g., for use with extracting discrete samples via the material extraction<br>
conduit), and a thermal source or sink subsystem 1756 adapted to promote temperature<br>
control of the tank 1701. A controller 1750 may be provided to receive various sensory<br>
inputs and provide command signals to any of the various components of the system 1700.<br>
The controller 1750 is preferably microprocessor-based and adapted to automate the system<br>
1700 while permitting execution of user-defined or preprogrammed instructions.<br>
 <br>
[00122] To test the efficacy of baffles and various (fixed) gas injection or sparger<br>
elements, Applicants constructed a flexible mixing tank and tested the same with support<br>
containers with and without baffles to determine Kla values. An ATMI C-mix system<br>
employing a polymeric film-based flexible bag-type mixing tank (200 liter volume, 575 mm<br>
diameter, 900mm height) was used in conjunction with a mixing paddle apparatus such as<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2B. Tests were performed with both 100 liter and 200 liter fluid<br>
volumes, with varying mixing paddle angles (departure from central vertical axis of tank) to<br>
avoid contact between the paddle and baffles, with varying mixing speeds and air flows, with<br>
various air inlet positions, and with or without two baffles of 50 millimeter diameter. Data<br>
obtained from these tests are reproduced below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
TABLE 1: Kla Data<br>
[00123] In a subsequent test performed in the same apparatus, a Kla value of 195/h was<br>
obtained with 6000 liters per hour of air flow into 100 liters with two baffles in place. It is<br>
noted that the foregoing data represents early experimental results without the benefit of<br>
extensive optimization efforts, such that the values obtained should not be construed as upper<br>
performance limits for corresponding devices.<br>
[00124] The benefit of adding a sparger (such as a sparger including a microporous or<br>
microperforated material) to a paddle is illustrated in FIG. 21, which provides a plot of<br>
experimental data providing Kla values as a function of gas flow rate obtained for mixing<br>
apparatuses according to an aspect of the present invention, for runs performed at low paddle<br>
speeds and flow rates suitable for cell culture. Three data series are illustrated, with one run<br>
each corresponding to use of a static sparger including a static Tyvek® material, a static<br>
sparger including a Porex® material, and a paddle- supported sparger including a Porex®<br>
material. The paddle-supported sparger yielded approximately 50% greater Kla performance<br>
than the other placements, under equivalent conditions.<br>
[00125] In further embodiments, a mixing tank/bioreactor may include external heating<br>
and/or cooling means useful in conjunction with one or more temperature sensors such as<br>
described hereinabove for controlling the temperature of components in the disposable mixing<br>
tank. In one embodiment, a circulation loop may be provided to direct a portion of the<br>
contents of the mixing tank through a heat exchanger (to provide heating or cooling utility)<br>
and back into the tank. In another embodiment, an external support container and/or a<br>
secondary containment system may envelop the exterior of the disposable mixing tank or a<br>
portion thereof to serve as a housing for a thermal exchange fluid (that is preferably<br>
circulatable around the exterior of the mixing tank, such as with a pump) to conduct heat into<br>
or out of the mixing tank via the tank wall, preferably with an external heat exchanger in fluid<br>
communication with the thermal exchange fluid. For example, a double walled support<br>
 <br>
container having a circulatable water bath connected to an external pump and heater/chiller<br>
unit with heat exchanger may be employed A heat exchange subsystem may include any<br>
appropriate components such as heating jackets, heating and cooling tanks, heat exchangers,<br>
chillers, and fluid cooling systems.<br>
[00126] Material processing apparatuses and systems according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention are useful for fermentation or culturing living cells, with such cells being<br>
processable or adapted to yield a variety of useful products including chemicals,<br>
biochemicals, and organic compounds. More specific examples of useful products include<br>
antibiotics (e.g., pen, streptomycin, etc.), enzymes (e.g., proteases, cellulases, hemicellulases,<br>
etc.); pharmaceutical and biopharmaceuticals (e.g., antibodies, vaccines, etc.), food /<br>
industrial additives (e.g., vitamins, amino acids, citric acid, acetic acid, arabic gum, xanthan<br>
gum, monosodium glutamate, etc.); aroma molecules (e.g., termineol), biodegradable plastics<br>
(e.g., polyhdryoxibutyrate); biopolymers, pigments, dyes, insecticides, and the like.<br>
[00127] Apparatuses according to the present invention are well suited for performing<br>
methods of culturing living cells. A first method of culturing cells utilizes an apparatus with a<br>
mechanically driven mixing paddle and a functional element arranged to move with a mixing<br>
paddle within a tank (as described hereinabove), and includes the steps of: supplying a<br>
plurality of materials to the tank; driving the mixing paddle to move within the tank; and<br>
applying the functional element to at least a portion of the materials within the tank. The<br>
living cells may be adapted to yield any of a chemical, a biochemical, and an organic<br>
compound. The living cells may be further adapted to yield any of an antibiotic material, an<br>
enzyme, an antibody, and a vaccine<br>
[00128] A second method of culturing cells utilizes an apparatus with a mechanically<br>
driven mixing paddle and a functional element interface adapted for coupling with a<br>
functional element arranged to travel with a mixing paddle, wherein the functional element is<br>
in fluid communication or sensory communication with the interior of a tank (as described<br>
hereinabove), and includes the steps of: supplying a plurality of materials to the tank; driving<br>
the mixing paddle to move within the tank; and utilizing the functional element interface in<br>
application of a functional element to at least a portion of the materials in the tank. The living<br>
cells may be adapted to yield any of a chemical, a biochemical, an organic compound, an<br>
antibiotic material, an enzyme, an antibody, and a vaccine<br>
 <br>
[00129] A third method of culturing cells utilizes an apparatus with a sparger and a<br>
mixing paddle disposed within the interior of the tank, the paddle being adapted to engage a<br>
support rod mechanically coupleable to receive kinetic energy from a kinetic energy source,<br>
with the apparatus being adapted to permit pivotal movement of the support rod between the<br>
kinetic energy source and the mixing tank; such method includes the steps: of supplying a<br>
plurality of materials to the tank; driving the mixing paddle to move within the tank; and<br>
supplying gas through the sparger to the interior of the tank.<br>
[00130] While the invention has been described herein in reference to specific aspects,<br>
features and illustrative embodiments of the invention, it will be appreciated that the utility of<br>
the invention is not thus limited, but rather extends to and encompasses numerous other<br>
variations, modifications and alternative embodiments, as will suggest themselves to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the field of the present invention, based on the disclosure herein.<br>
Correspondingly, the invention as hereinafter claimed is intended to be broadly construed and<br>
interpreted, as including all such variations, modifications and alternative embodiments,<br>
within its spirit and scope.<br>
