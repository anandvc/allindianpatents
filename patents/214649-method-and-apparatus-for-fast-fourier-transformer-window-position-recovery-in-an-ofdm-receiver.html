				<td>The present invention relates to processing orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexed (OFDM) signals.<br>
A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a flexible data communications system<br>
implemented as an extension to, or as an alternative for, a wired LAN within a<br>
building or campus. Using electromagnetic waves, WLANs transmit and receive<br>
data over the air, minimizing the need for wired connections. Thus, WLANs<br>
combine data connectivity with user mobility, and, through simplified<br>
configuration, enable movable LANs. Some industries that have benefited from<br>
the productivity gains of using portable terminals (e.g., notebook computers) to<br>
transmit and receive real-time information are the digital home networking,<br>
health-care, retail, manufacturing, and warehousing industries.<br>
Manufacturers of WLANs have a range of transmission technologies to<br>
choose from when designing a WLAN. Some exemplary technologies are<br>
multicarrier systems, spread spectrum systems, narrowband systems, and<br>
infrared systems. Although each system has its own benefits and detriments,<br>
one particular type of multicarrier transmission system, orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM), has proven to be exceptionally useful for WLAN<br>
communications.<br>
OFDM is a robust technique for efficiently transmitting data over a<br>
channel. The technique uses a plurality of sub-carrier frequencies (sub-carriers)<br>
within a channel bandwidth to transmit data. These sub-carriers are arranged for<br>
optimal bandwidth efficiency compared to conventional frequency division<br>
multiplexing (FDM) which can waste portions of the channel bandwidth in order<br>
to separate and isolate the sub-carrier frequency spectra and thereby avoid inter-<br>
carrier interference (ICI). By contrast, although the frequency spectra of OFDM<br>
sub-carriers overlap significantly within the OFDM channel bandwidth, OFDM<br>
nonetheless allows resolution and recovery of the information that has been<br>
modulated onto each sub-carrier.<br>
The transmission of data through a channel via OFDM signals also<br>
provides several other advantages over more conventional transmission<br>
techniques. Some of these advantages are a tolerance to multipath delay spread<br>
and frequency selective fading, efficient spectrum usage simplified sub-channel<br>
equalization, and good interference properties.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, an OFDM signal 10 is transmitted as blocks of<br>
user data 12 separated by guard intervals known as cyclic prefixes 14. A cyclic<br>
prefix 14 is a copy of a portion of an adjacent block of user data 12 and is used<br>
to reduce Inter-Symbol Interference {ISO caused by multipath fading. More<br>
particularly, only cyclic prefixes 14, as opposed to user data 12, are effected by<br>
ISI, as is known by those skilled in the art. Thus the removal of cyclic prefixes<br>
14 by an OFDM receiver removes the effects of ISI from the received OFDM<br>
signal.<br>
At the OFDM receiver a received OFDM signal 10 is digitized or sampled<br>
to convert the OFDM signal from an analog to a digital signal. Afterwards, the<br>
OFDM receiver applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) windows to the OFDM<br>
signal to remove the cyclic prefixes from a received OFDM signal. Ideally, an<br>
OFDM window 16 only passes user data 12 to an FFT unit 18 and discards<br>
cyclic prefixes 14. However, if there is a sampling frequency offset between the<br>
OFDM transmitter and the OFDM receiver, FFT window 16 may drift beyond the<br>
boundaries of user data 12. If this drift occurs, as shown in FIG. 2, a portion or<br>
sample 20 of cyclic prefix 14 may be passed to FFT unit 18 and a portion or<br>
sample 22 of user data 12 may be lost. As a result, the window drifting effect<br>
may result in the presence of ISI in a received OFDM signal. Furthermore, an<br>
offset of FFT window 16 will result in a phase rotation in the output of FFT unit<br>
18. The rotation occurs because a time shift in the time domain results in a<br>
phase rotation in the frequency domain. The phase rotation may generate errors<br>
in the user data recovered by the OFDM receiver.<br>
One way to correct for the drifting effect is to lock the frequency of the<br>
receiver"s sampler or ADC to the transmitter sampling frequency using a phase-<br>
locked loop. Turning to FIG. 3, an exemplary phase-locked loop configuration 24<br>
includes an ADC 26 that samples a received OFDM signal. An FFT window unit<br>
28 receives the OFDM samples, removes cyclic prefixes, and passes user data to<br>
a FFT unit 30, as discussed above. A pilot extractor 32 extracts pilots imbedded<br>
in the user data and passes the pilots to a phase difference calculator 32. A<br>
pilot is a reference signal (having a known phase) that is embedded in an OFDM<br>
symbol on a predetermined subcarrier. Phase difference calculator 32 calculates<br>
the phase difference between the pilots within the OFDM symbols and passes<br>
the calculated difference to a sampling offset detector 36. Sampling offset<br>
detector 36 detects a sampling offset between the transmitter and receiver using<br>
the calculated difference and outputs the sampling offset to a digital phase-<br>
locked loop 38. Digital phase-locked loop 38 controls the sampling clocks of<br>
ADC 26 and ensures consistent FFT window positioning throughout the<br>
reception of the transmission once digital phase-locked loop 38 has locked.<br>
Although PLL configuration 24 ensures consistent FFT window positioning<br>
once digital phase-locked loop 38 has locked, PLL configuration 24 has several<br>
drawbacks. One drawback is that PLL configuration 24 may not correctly<br>
position the FFT window due to noise and channel effects. The incorrect<br>
positioning (i.e., window offset) may cause a phase rotation in the output of FFT<br>
unit 30 that, in turn, may cause errors in the user data recovered by the OFDM<br>
receiver. Another drawback is that digital phase-locked loop 38 of PLL<br>
configuration 24 is costly to implement.<br>
If the local sampling clock of the OFDM receiver has a small offset with<br>
respect to the transmitter sampling frequency it may be advantageous (e.g., to<br>
reduce costs) to remove the digital phase-locked loop and utilize a free-running<br>
local clock. However, by utilizing a free-running clock without a phase-locked<br>
loop, a small sampling offset, over time, can accumulate and shift the FFT<br>
window beyond the user data boundaries. As noted above, the FFT window<br>
shift may introduce errors, such as ISI, into the user data portion of a received<br>
OFDM symbol. The present invention is directed to the correction of this<br>
problem.<br>
An Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) receiver that<br>
extracts pilots from a fast Fourier transformed and equalized OFDM signal, and<br>
processes the extracted pilots to derive an FFT window adjustment factor and an<br>
associated equalizer tap adjustment value. The OFDM receiver simultaneously<br>
controls the position of an FFT window and the phase of equalizer taps using the<br>
FFT adjustment factor and equalizer tap adjustment value.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMOANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The aforementioned advantages of the invention, as well as additional<br>
advantages thereof, will be more fully understood as a result of a detailed<br>
description of the preferred embodiment when taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram of an OFDM signal having user data and cyclic prefix<br>
portions, and associated processors;<br>

FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a phase lock loop configuration for a<br>
conventional OFDM receiver;<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating the placement of a training sequence, user<br>
data, and pilot signals within an OFDM symbol frame according to the present<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a window shift correction<br>
arrangement for an OFDM receiver according to the present invention: and<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an FFT window correction algorithm of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent from the following description, given by way of example.<br>
Turning to FIG. 4, an exemplary OFDM symbol frame 40 of the present<br>
invention is shown. Symbol frame 40 includes a training sequence 44<br>
containing known transmission values for each subcarrier in the OFDM carrier,<br>
and a predetermined number of cyclic prefix 42 and user data 46 pairs. User<br>
data 46 has a predetermined number of pilots 48, also containing known<br>
transmission values, embedded on predetermined subcarriers. For example, the<br>
proposed ETSI-BRAN HIPERLAN/2 (Europe) and IEEE 802.11a (USA) wireless<br>
LAN standards, herein incorporated by reference, have four pilots located at bins<br>
or subcarriers ±7 and ±21.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, an FFT window synchronization network or<br>
system 50 of the present invention is shown. It should be noted that system 50<br>
may be embodied in software, hardware, or some combination thereof. For<br>
example, system 50 may be part of an WLAN adapter that is implemented as a<br>
PC card for a notebook or palmtop computer, as a card in a desktop computer,<br>
or integrated within a hand-held computer. System 50 is coupled to a source 52<br>
of OFDM time-domain samples (e.g., the output of an ADC driven by a free<br>
running clock that is not controlled by a PLL) that has a small sampling frequency<br>
offset with respect to the sampling frequency of an OFDM transmitter. As noted<br>
above, such an offset could cause an FFT window drift which, in turn, may<br>
result in a phase rotation in the output of an FFT unit and ISI. System 50<br>
includes a coarse FFT window synch unit 54 coupled to source 52 and an FFT<br>
unit 56. Coarse FFT window synch unit 54 obtains an initial estimate of the FFT<br>
window position and triggers FFT unit 56 when the samples from source 52 fall<br>
within the estimated window position. Coarse window synch unit 54 may use<br>
known window synch techniques such as detection of cross-correlation peaks or<br>
autocorrelation peaks of a known training sequence (e.g., training sequence 44<br>
of FIG. 4). Coarse window synch unit 54 obtains an approximate (within several<br>
samples of the correct window position) initial estimate of the window position.<br>
Afterwards, the window position is finely adjusted, as described in further detail<br>
below.<br>
An equalizer 58 is coupled to the output of FFT unit 56. Equalizer 58<br>
reduces the multi-path distortion effects of the channel that the OFDM signal is<br>
transmitted through. Equalizer 58 is initialized using a training sequence (e.g.,<br>
training sequence 44 of FIG. 4) stored in a memory 60 to set the equalizer tap<br>
settings. As discussed above, the training sequence contains known<br>
transmission values on all of the subcarriers of the OFDM carrier. A conventional<br>
technique for computing an initial tap value for each subcarrier is to set the tap<br>
for the subcarrier equal to the known transmission value of the subcarrier (as<br>
stored in memory 60) divided by the output on the subcarrier received from FFT<br>
unit 56. The initialization of equalizer 58 not only reduces the effect of the<br>
channel but also cancels out a phase rotation generated by an incorrect FFT<br>
window position. However, according to a feature of the present invention, the<br>
initialization only cancels out the phase rotation of the pilot subcarriers at the<br>
time of initialization, and equalizer 58 does not track the continuous phase<br>
rotations of the pilot subcarriers caused by a drifting window position.<br>
After the taps of equalizer 58 are initially set, equalizer 58 adapts the<br>
equalizer taps for the data subcarriers but does not adapt the taps for the pilot<br>
subcarriers (e.g., pilots 48 of FIG. 4). Equalizer 58 does not adapt the pilot taps<br>
so the phase rotation generated by incorrect FFT window position is passed on<br>
the pilot subcarriers to a pilot extraction unit 62 and a fine FFT window synch<br>
unit 64, as discussed in further detail below.<br>
Pilot extraction unit 62 is coupled to an output of equalizer 58 and an<br>
input of fine FFT window synch unit 64. Pilot extraction unit 62 extracts pilots<br>
(e.g., pilots 48 of FIG. 4) embedded in the user data (e.g., user data 46 of FIG.<br>
4) sent to downstream processing 66 (e.g., demodulation, decoding, and the<br>
like) and passes the pilots to a fine FFT window synch unit 64. Fine FFT<br>
window synch unit 64 is coupled to an input of FFT unit 56 to finely adjust FFT<br>
window position. Fine FFT window synch unit 64 is also coupled to an input of<br>
equalizer 58 to adjust the phase rotation of the equalizer taps. More specifically,<br>
fine FFT window synch unit 64 executes an algorithm that provides two outputs.<br>
The first output is a fine window adjustment factor 65 that is passed to FFT unit<br>
56 to shift an FFT window in one sample increments. The second output is a<br>
phase compensation value 67 that is passed to equalizer 58 in order to rotate<br>
the equalizer taps in an equal but opposite direction from the phase rotation that<br>
is induced by the fine adjustment of the FFT window. The rotation of the<br>
equalizer taps is necessary to avoid a discrete phase jump that could disturb the<br>
tracking ability of equalizer 58.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, a flowchart 70 illustrating the algorithm of the<br>
present invention is shown. Initially, at step 72, fine FFT window synch unit 64<br>
acquires the phase of a pilot embedded in the user data. Next, at step 74, fine<br>
FFT window synch unit 64 compares the absolute value of the acquired phase to<br>
the absolute value of O. O is defined as:<br>
Wherein k is the subcarrier or bin location of the pilot (e.g., ±7 or ±21). Ts is<br>
the phase shift of the lowest positive frequency subcarrier that results from an<br>
FFT window offset of 1 sample (e.g., the phase shift that would occur at<br>
subcarrier or bin location +1). Thus, for k-th carrier, the corresponding phase<br>
shift is kTs (e.g., at the 7th subcarrier the phase shift is 7Ts). ? is a safety margin<br>
or buffer value that is added to kTs in order to prevent a false window<br>
adjustment due to noise. The sgn( ) denotes a signum function that generates a<br>
+ 1 or a -1 depending on the sign of the subcarrier location (e.g., at the +7 bin<br>
location the sgn( ) function generates a +1 and at the -7 bin location the sgn( )<br>
function generates a -1).<br>
If the absolute value of the phase does not exceed the absolute value of<br>
O, the fine FFT window synch unit 64 resets or zeroes the positive phase shift<br>
(M+) and negative phase shift (M-) counters and, returning to step 72, acquires<br>
the phase of the next pilot. It should be noted that there are positive and<br>
negative phase shift counters (M+ and M-) for each pilot subcarrier. For example,<br>
if pilots are located at the ±7 and ±21 bins, there will be eight counters<br>
allocated for tracking positive and negative phase shifts on the ±7 and ±21<br>
bins.<br>
If the absolute value of the phase exceeds the absolute value of O, the<br>
fine FFT window synch unit 64, at step 78, determines if the phase shift is<br>
positive. If the phase shift is positive, the fine FFT window synch unit 64, at<br>
step 82, increments the positive phase shift counter (M+) associated with the<br>
pilot by 1. If the phase shift is not positive, fine FFT window synch unit 64, at<br>
step 80, increments the negative phase shift counter (M-) associated with the<br>
pilot by 1.<br>
After incrementing a counter (either M+ or M-) for a given pilot, fine FFT<br>
window synch unit 64, at step 84, determines if a majority of the counters (M +<br>
or M-) for all the pilots have reached a threshold or predetermined value. For<br>
example, if the pilots are located at ±7 and ±21, fine FFT window synch unit<br>
64 acquires the count of the eight counters (four M+ counters and four M-<br>
counters). Afterwards, fine FFT window synch unit 64 determines if a majority<br>
of the M+ or M- counters have reached a predetermined value (e.g., a value of<br>
5). If the predetermined value has not been reached, the fine FFT window synch<br>
unit 64 returns to step 72 and acquires the phase of the next pilot. When the<br>
predetermined value is reached the FFT window is adjusted by at least 1 sample.<br>
The direction of adjustment is selected based upon which counters (either M+ or<br>
M-) have reached the predetermined value. Thus, if the predetermined value has<br>
been reached, fine FFT window synch unit 64, at step 86, adjust the window<br>
position of FFT 56 and the phase of the equalizer taps of equalizer 58, as<br>
discussed in further detail below. It should be noted that the threshold or<br>
predetermined value is used to reduce the effects of noise on the detection of a<br>
window offset. For example, an increase in noise may cause the absolute value<br>
of a detected pilot phase to exceed O. once. However, only a phase rotation<br>
induced by a window shift would cause multiple successive occurrences of a<br>
pilot phase exceeding O.<br>
Adjusting the FFT window position by a sample creates a discontinuous<br>
jump in phase for the frequency-domain data. To avoid the discontinuous jump<br>
in phase, the phase of each equalizer data tap is adjusted by kTs radians where<br>
the direction of the rotation adjustment is opposite the direction of the rotation<br>
that would have otherwise been induced by the FFT window shift. However, it<br>
should be noted that the phases of the equalizer pilot taps are not adjusted so<br>
fine FFT window synch unit 64 can track the phase changes of the pilot<br>
subcarriers caused by FFT window drift.<br>
Thus according to the principle of the present invention, an OFDM receiver<br>
extracts pilots from a Fast Fourier Transformed and equalized OFDM signal, and<br>
processes the extracted pilots to derive an FFT window adjustment factor and an<br>
associated equalizer tap adjustment value. The OFDM receiver simultaneously<br>
controls the position of an FFT window and the phase of equalizer taps using the<br>
FFT adjustment factor and equalizer tap adjustment value.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to the<br>

position recovery in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
receiver to reduce errors in the user data portion of a received OFDM symbol,<br>
the method comprising: processing a received OFDM signal to produce a Fast<br>
Fourier Transformed and equalized OFDM signal; extracting a pilot from the Fast<br>
Fourier Transformed and equalized OFDM signal; processing the extracted pilot<br>
to derive an FFT window adjustment factor (65) and an associated equator tap<br>
adjustment value (67); and utilizing the adjustment values (65,67) In the<br>
preprocessing step.</td>
