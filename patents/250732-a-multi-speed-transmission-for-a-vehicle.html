MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Application Number 60/867,683, filed November 29, 2006, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to a multi-speed transmission for a vehicle<br>
providing a plurality of forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio<br>
through selective engagement of six torque-transmitting mechanisms located in a<br>
selected zone or zones of the transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Multi-speed transmissions in automotive vehicles allow for operating<br>
efficiency and smooth feel.  Multiple planetary gear sets have been utilized to provide<br>
eight or more forward speed ratios with relatively efficient packaging due to the<br>
compact nature of planetary gear sets.  A number of selectively engagable torque- ransmitting<br>
mechanisms are controlled to interconnect different members of the<br>
planetary gear sets with one another, with the transmission casing, or sometimes with<br>
the transmission input or output member to achieve the various speed ratios.   Efficient<br>
packaging of the torque-transmitting mechanisms helps to minimize the overall<br>
dimensions of the transmission, potentially allowing its use in more vehicle platforms,<br>
reducing weight, and minimizing manufacturing complexity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	A multi-speed transmission is provided with three planetary gear sets,<br>
each having a ring gear member, a sun gear member and a carrier member that<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears that intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
member and the ring gear member.  Certain members of the gear sets are continuously<br>
1<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
connected for common rotation.   Specifically, an interconnecting member continuously<br>
interconnects for common rotation the carrier member of the first planetary gear set,<br>
the sun gear member of the second planetary gear set and the ring gear member of the<br>
third planetary gear set.  Additionally, the sun gear member of the first planetary gear<br>
set is continuously grounded to the transmission casing.<br>
[0005]	Preferably, an input member is continuously interconnected for common<br>
rotation with the sun gear member of the third planetary gear set, and an output<br>
member is continuously interconnected for common rotation with the ring gear member<br>
of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0006]	Six torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively engagable to connect<br>
selected members of the planetary gear sets for common rotation.  The six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms are engagable in different combinations to achieve eight<br>
forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio between the input member and the output<br>
member.<br>
[0007]	A transmission casing surrounds the planetary gear sets and torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms and defines a cavity having five different zones.   The<br>
transmission casing includes opposing first and second end walls and a housing portion<br>
therebetween.   As used herein, a "zone" is a portion of the cavity.   A first zone extends<br>
axially from the first end wall to one of the planetary gear sets.  A second and a third<br>
zone each extends between different adjacent pairs of the planetary gear sets.  A fourth<br>
zone extends from another one of the planetary gear sets to the second end wall.   Each<br>
of the first, second, third, and fourth zones extends radially to an outer surface of a<br>
radially-outermost one of the members.  A fifth zone borders the first, second, third,<br>
and fourth zones, extends radially outward to the housing portion and extends axially<br>
between the first and second end walls.<br>
[0008]	Each torque-transmitting mechanism may be located in selected ones of<br>
the zones that further desirability of (i) minimizing the overall size of the transmission,<br>
(ii) reducing weight, (iii) providing a convenient location for hydraulic feed to the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism, such as by locating the torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
close to the transmission casing or to a centrally-located shaft, both of which typically<br>
2<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
define at least part of a feed path to supply hydraulic fluid to torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms, and (iv) reducing the overall complexity (e.g., the number, shape and size<br>
of hub members and other interconnecting members used to connect members of the<br>
planetary gear sets with one another or with the transmission casing).  Different<br>
embodiments of the transmission are possible by arranging the planetary gear sets in a<br>
different order (e.g., the order moving axially from the first end wall to the second end<br>
wall) in the transmission.  The six torque-transmitting mechanisms are located in at<br>
least one of the five zones in each such embodiment within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0009]	Preferably, the sun gear member of the first planetary gear set is<br>
continuously grounded to the transmission casing via a radially-extending structural<br>
member.  At least one of the torque-transmitting mechanisms selectively grounds one of<br>
the members of one of the planetary gear sets to the transmission casing via the<br>
radially-extending structural member.<br>
[0010]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0029]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components. Figure 1A shows a transmission 10 having an input member 12 for<br>
receiving power from a power source such as an internal combustion engine and output<br>
member 14 for delivering power to a final drive mechanism such as the wheels of a<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0030]	The transmission 10 includes a gearing arrangement 16 having three<br>
planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40 and six selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56, 57 and 58. Each planetary gear set 20, 30 and 40 includes<br>
rotatable components concentric with a centerline 60 of the transmission 10.<br>
Specifically, planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 22, a ring gear member 24<br>
and a carrier member 26 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 27 that<br>
intermesh with both the sun gear member 22 and the ring gear member 24.  Planetary<br>
gear set 30 includes a sun gear member 32, a ring gear member 34 and a carrier member<br>
36 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 37 that intermesh with both the sun<br>
5<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
gear member 32 and the ring gear member 34. Planetary gear set 40 includes a sun gear<br>
member 42, a ring gear member 44 and a carrier member 46 that rotatably supports a<br>
plurality of pinion gears 47 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 42 and the ring<br>
gear member 44.<br>
[0031]	In referring to the first, second and third gear planetary gear sets in this<br>
description and in the claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in<br>
the drawings (i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.).   In the embodiment of Figure 1A.<br>
planetary gear set 30 is the first planetary gear set, planetary gear set 40 is the second<br>
planetary gear set, and planetary gear set 20 is the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0032]	The input member 12 is continuously connected for common rotation with<br>
sun gear member 22. The output member 14 is continuously connected for common<br>
rotation with ring gear member 44. An interconnecting member 70 continuously<br>
interconnects ring gear member 24 with carrier member 36 and sun gear member 42.   The<br>
interconnecting member 70 may be one component or multiple components.   The sun<br>
gear member 32 is continuously grounded to a housing 80 (also referred to herein as a<br>
housing portion) of the transmission 10 via a radially-extending structural member 81.<br>
The housing 80 circumferentially surrounds the gear sets 20, 30 and 40 as well as the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56, 57 and 58. The transmission 10 further<br>
includes a first end wall 82 generally at one end of the transmission 10 and a second end<br>
wall 84 generally at an opposing end of the transmission 10. The housing 80 joins the<br>
first and second end walls 82. 84. It should be appreciated that the housing 80 and the<br>
first and second end walls 82, 84 form a transmission casing, and may be integrated, or<br>
may each be a separate component or components of the casing. The transmission casing<br>
may be referred to herein as 80, 82, 84. The transmission casing 80, 82, 84 defines a<br>
cavity 85. The end walls 82 and 84 enclose the cavity 85 axially, but are likely a conical<br>
or irregular shape rather than a planar shape as schematically depicted.<br>
[0033]	The planetary gear sets 20, 30, and 40 and torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56, 57, and 58 are located in the cavity 85. The housing 80, end<br>
walls 82 and 84 and the planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40 cooperate to define five spaces<br>
or zones within the cavity 85. A first zone / is defined between an outer surface 86 of the<br>
first end wall 82 and a plane 88 running generally parallel with a side of the planetary<br>
6<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
gear set 20 adjacent the first end wall 82, and runs radially outward to a circumferential<br>
boundary 90 running along a radially-outermost periphery of each of the ring gear<br>
members 24, 34 and 44. A second zone II is defined between a plane 92 running<br>
generally parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 20 facing the planetary gear set<br>
30, a plane 94 running generally parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 30 facing<br>
the planetary gear set 20 and the circumferential boundary 90. A third zone III is defined<br>
between a plane 95 running generally parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 30<br>
facing the planetary gear set 40, a plane 96 running generally parallel along a side of the<br>
planetary gear set 40 facing the planetary gear set 30 and the circumferential boundary<br>
90. A fourth zone IV is defined between a plane 97 running generally parallel along a<br>
side of the planetary gear set 40 facing the second end wall 84, an outer surface 98 of the<br>
second end wall 84 and the circumferential boundary 90. A fifth zone V is defined<br>
between the circumferential boundary 90, an outer surface 99 of the housing 80, and the<br>
outer surfaces 86 and 98 of the first and second end walls 82 and 84, respectively.   The<br>
structural member 81 traverses zones III and V.<br>
[0034]	Torque-transmitting mechanisms 50, 52, 54, and 56 are rotating-type<br>
clutches and torque-transmitting mechanisms 57 and 58 are brakes, also referred to as<br>
reaction clutches or stationary clutches. Torque-transmitting mechanism 50 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the carrier member 26 for common rotation with the ring gear<br>
member 34. The torque-transmitting mechanism 52 is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the input member 12 and the sun gear member 22 for common rotation with the ring gear<br>
member 34. The torque-transmitting mechanism 54 is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the carrier member 26 for common rotation with the carrier member 46.   The torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 56 is selectively engagable to connect the input member 12 and<br>
the sun gear member 22 for common rotation with the carrier member 46. The torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 57 is selectively engagable to ground the carrier member 36 (as<br>
well as the ring gear member 24 and sun gear member 42) to the transmission housing 80<br>
via the structural member 81. The torque-transmitting mechanism 58 is selectively<br>
engagable to ground the carrier member 46 to the transmission housing 80 via the<br>
structural member 81.<br>
7<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
[0035]	The transmission 10 provides eight forward speed ratios and one reverse<br>
speed ratio between the input member 12 and the output member 14.  Specifically, a<br>
reverse speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 52 and 58;<br>
a first forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 54<br>
and 58; a second forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 54 and 57; a third forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 50 and 54; a fourth forward speed ratio is established by<br>
engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 52 and 54; a fifth forward speed ratio is<br>
established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 54 and 56; a sixth forward<br>
speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 52 and 56; a<br>
seventh forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
50 and 56; and an eighth forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 56 and 57. Preferably, in all embodiments of the invention, at<br>
least three of the speed ratios are overdrive ratios.<br>
[0036]	As shown in Figure 1A, torque-transmitting mechanisms 54 and 56 are<br>
located in zone II; torque-transmitting mechanisms 57 and 58 are disposed in zone III;<br>
and torque-transmitting mechanisms 50 and 52 are disposed in zone V. Alternatively, the<br>
interconnections between the various gear members, the input member 12, the output<br>
member 14 and the housing 80 obtained by selective engagement of the various torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism as described above are possible with the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56, 57 and 58 disposed in other zones as shown in the chart of<br>
Figure IB. An "X" in the chart of Figure IB shown below indicates that the particular<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism is positionable in the referenced zone and an "O"<br>
indicates that the particular torque-transmitting mechanisms are not to be located in the<br>
referenced zone.  It should be appreciated that the selection of location for the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism of each row in the chart of Figure IB is feasible independently of<br>
the other rows. Accordingly, torque-transmitting mechanism 50 is locatable in any of<br>
four possible zones; torque-transmitting mechanism 52 is locatable in any of four<br>
possible zones; torque-transmitting mechanism 54 is locatable in any of three possible<br>
zones; torque transmitting mechanism 56 is locatable in any of three possible zones:<br>
8<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 57 is locatable in any of two possible zones; and torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 58 is locatable in any of three possible zones.<br>
[0037]	A second embodiment of a transmission 100 within the scope of the<br>
invention is shown in Figure 2A. Transmission 100 has an input member 112 for<br>
receiving power from a power source such as an internal combustion engine and output<br>
member 114 for delivering power to a final drive mechanism such as the wheels of a<br>
vehicle. Both the input member 112 and the output member 114 extend through a first<br>
end wall 182 of the transmission 100.<br>
[0038]	The transmission 100 includes a gearing arrangement 116 having three<br>
planetary gear sets 120, 130 and 140 and six selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 150. 152, 154, 156, 157 and 158. In the embodiment of Figure 2A.<br>
planetary gear set 140 is the first planetary gear set, planetary gear set 120 is the second<br>
planetary gear set, and planetary gear set 130 is the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0039]	Each planetary gear set 120, 130 and 140 includes rotatable components<br>
concentric with a centerline 160 of the transmission 100. Specifically, planetary gear set<br>
120 includes a sun gear member 122, a ring gear member 124 and a carrier member 126<br>
that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 127 that intermcsh with both the sun<br>
gear member 122 and the ring gear member 124. Planetary gear set 130 includes a sun<br>
gear member 132, a ring gear member 134 and a carrier member 136 that rotatably<br>
supports a plurality of pinion gears 137 that intermesh with both the sun gear member<br>
132 and the ring gear member 134. Planetary gear set 140 includes a sun gear member<br>
142, a ring gear member 144 and a carrier member 146 that rotatably supports a plurality<br>
of pinion gears 147 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 142 and the ring gear<br>
member 144.<br>
[0040]	The input member 112 is continuously connected for common rotation<br>
with sun gear member 132. The output member 114 is continuously connected for<br>
common rotation with ring gear member 124. An interconnecting member 170<br>
continuously interconnects ring gear member 134 with carrier member 146 and sun gear<br>
member 122. The interconnecting member 170 may be one component or multiple<br>
components. The sun gear member 142 is continuously grounded to a housing 180 of the<br>
transmission 100 via a radially-extending structural member 181. The housing 180<br>
9<br><br>
P000143-PTT-DLT<br>
circumferentially surrounds the gear sets 120, 130 and 140 as well as the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 150, 152, 154, 156, 157 and 158. The transmission 100 further<br>

receiving power from a power source such as an internal combustion engine and output<br>
member 714 for delivering power to a final drive mechanism such as the wheels of a<br>
vehicle. Both the input member 712 and the output member 714 extend through a first<br>
end wall 782 of the transmission 700.<br>

[0088]	Each planetary gear set 720, 730 and 740 includes rotatable components<br>
