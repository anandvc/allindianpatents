SOURCE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]      This application claims the benefit of priority to United States patent application serial no. 11/020,013 filed December 21, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]      Oral care compositions are used for a wide variety of purposes, including for enhancing personal health, hygiene, and appearance, as well as for preventing or treating a variety of diseases and other conditions in humans and in animals.<br>
[0003]      The formulation of such compositions presents a number of challenges. They must be pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for their intended use. Compositions that contain therapeutic active materials preferably deliver the active at effective levels, avoiding undue chemical degradation. Similarly, compositions containing cosmetically functional materials must deliver the material to the oral cavity at effective levels under the conditions that they are typically used by the consumer.<br>
[0004]      Moreover, the aesthetic appeal of all such compositions is important, and can have significant effects on consumer acceptance and usage. Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the<br>
cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products. Indeed, many such compositions known in the art are deficient in one or more attributes. Thus, there is an ongoing need for new oral care compositions, and methods of their use.<br>
[0005]      Fluoride is a very well known anti-cavity agent, widely used in toothpaste. However, fluoride use in toothpowder is complicated because of settling issues. In this regard, fluoride needs to be controlled to provide, for instance, a maximum of 1000 parts per million of soluble fluoride ion in some countries and a maximum of 1500 parts per million of soluble fluoride ion in other countries; and settling of a toothpowder fluoride ion source within a toothpowder container is of concern insofar as localized fluoride ion concentrations might be elevated above the acceptable level by such settling. Toothpaste is usually formulated to have a viscosity that preempts such settling in fluoride ion sources within the toothpaste, but toothpowder needs to provide a movable particulate so that the powder can be poured for use.<br>
[0006]      However, the effectiveness of toothpowder in providing a fluoride ion source is therefore adversely affected because of this challenge respective to the composition and consumer compliance.<br>
SUMMARY [0007]      The present invention provides oral care compositions. In somewhat greater detail, the invention is for toothpowder of clinically efficacious fluoride ion source particulate dispersed in an orally acceptable abrasive calcium carbonate particulate bed.<br>
 [0008]      In another aspect, the fluoride ion source particulate is any of particulate sodium monofluorophosphate, particulate sodium fluoride, particulate stannous fluoride, or combinations thereof.<br>
[0009]      In a further aspect where the fluoride ion source is particulate sodium monofluorophosphate, particulate sodium fluoride, particulate stannous fluoride or combinations thereof, the bed has a volume of at least 125 cubic millimeters, at least 99 percent of individual calcium carbonate particles in the bed have an independent calcium carbonate particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns, at least 99 percent of individual fluoride ion source particulate particles in the set have an independent fluoride ion source particulate particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns, and any 125 cubic millimeter volumetric portion of the bed has a concentration of fluoride ion source providing from about 500 to about 1500 parts per million of soluble fluoride respective to calcium carbonate.<br>
[0010] In further aspects dispersed sodium lauryl sulfate particulate, dispersed saccharin particulate, citric acid, and/or flavor oil are added into the toothpowder as described above.<br>
[0011]      In yet a further aspect where the fluoride ion source particulate comprises sodium monofluorophosphate, a particulate bed of the toothpowder has a volume of at least 125 cubic millimeters and comprises from about 60 to about 98 weight percent calcium carbonate, from about 0.38 to about 1.14 weight percent sodium monofluorophosphate, from about 0.5 to about 3.5 weight percent sodium lauryl sulfate, from about 0.02 to about 0.5 weight percent<br>
saccharin, from about 0.05 to about 0.4 weight percent citric acid, and from about 0.5 to about 3.5 weight percent flavor oil.<br>
[0012]      The invention is also for admixing clinically efficacious fluoride ion source particulate into orally acceptable abrasive particulate according to any of the above-described formulations.<br>
[0013]      In yet a further aspect the admixing is performed by use of a ribbon blender.<br>
[0014]      In yet a further aspect the ribbon blender has a first end and a second end and the admixing is performed by charging the blender with the calcium carbonate and continuously adding a first pulverized stream of particulated fluoride ion source material to the first end of the ribbon blender and a second pulverized stream of particulated fluoride ion source material to the second end of the ribbon blender until the particulated fluoride ion source material is admixed into the calcium carbonate particulate.<br>
[0015]      In another aspect, the invention provides a method for cleaning teeth by brushing the teeth with about 1 gram of the toothpowder according to the above-described formulation.<br>
[0016]      It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions among known in the art.<br>
[0017]      Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating embodiments of the<br>
invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

Compositions<br>
[0025]      The present invention provides toothpowder as oral care compositions and methods for administration or application to, or use with, a human or other animal subject. In overview, a toothpowder oral care composition of fluoride ion source particulate (such as stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, and/or sodium monofluorophosphate particulate) dispersed in an oral abrasive calcium carbonate particulate bed is achieved with careful adjustment of the particle sizes of both the fluorinated particulate and the abrasive particulate to achieve a bed of toothpowder where neither the fluorinated particulate or the abrasive particulate will settle to create a localized concentration of the fluoride<br>
significantly different from the average concentration of the fluoride throughout the bed of toothpowder.<br>
[0026]      As referred to herein, an "oral care composition" is any composition that is suitable for administration or application to the oral cavity a human or animal subject for enhancing the health, hygiene or appearance of the subject, preferably providing such benefits as: the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of the teeth, gums, mucosa or other hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity; the prevention or treatment of a systemic condition or disorder; the provision of sensory, decorative or cosmetic benefits; and combinations thereof. In various preferred embodiments, an oral care composition is not intentionally swallowed, but is rather retained in the oral cavity for a time sufficient to effect the intended utility. Preferably, specific materials and compositions to be used in this invention are, accordingly, pharmaceutically- or cosmetically-acceptable, clinically effective, and/or clinically efficacious. As used herein, such a "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "cosmetically acceptable", "clinically effective", and/or "clinically efficacious" component is one that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals and is provided in an appropriate amount (a clinically efficacious amount) to provide the desired therapeutic, prophylactic, sensory, decorative, or cosmetic benefit without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
Orally acceptable carrier<br>
[0027]      The present invention provides toothpowder compositions comprising an orally acceptable carrier. Such a carrier comprises a material or combination of materials that is safe for use in the compositions of the present invention, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, with which flavor oil and natural calcium carbonate may be intrinsically associated while retaining significant efficacy. In use, the carrier provides an orally acceptable particulate bed. As used herein, an "orally acceptable particulate bed" refers to a quantity of the composition for application to the teeth of a human or other animal subject in a single use. In various embodiments, the bed has a minimum weight of about 1 gram, conforming to a volume of about 0.95 cc, for application to the teeth in a single instance of a tooth brushing operation. In packaged form for consumer purchase, the bed varies from a size of about 10 grams in a sachet up to about 300 grams in a large can. In manufacturing operations, the bed constitutes a normal charge for a mixing system such as a ribbon blender.<br>
[0028]      Materials among those that are useful in carriers include adhesion agents, surfactants, foam modulators, abrasives, pH modifying agents, humectants, mouth feel agents, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, and combinations thereof. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of materials may differ, there may be some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two or more of such categories of materials. Preferably, such carrier materials are selected for<br>
compatibility with fluoride ion source and with other ingredients of the composition.<br>
[0029]      Mouth-feel agents include materials imparting a desirable texture or other feeling during use of the composition. Such agents include dispersed flavorants and sweeteners.<br>
[0030]      Flavorants among those useful herein include any material or mixture of materials operable to enhance the taste of the composition.

Also encompassed within flavorants herein are ingredients that provide fragrance and/or other sensory effect in the mouth, including cooling or warming effects. Such ingredients include menthol, menthyl acetate, menthyl lactate, camphor, eucalyptus oil, eucalyptol, anethole, eugenol, cassia, oxanone, a-irisone, propenyl guaiethol, thymol, linalool, benzaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, N-ethyl-p-menthan-3-carboxamine, N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropylbutanamide, 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol, cinnamaldehyde glycerol acetal (CGA), methone glycerol acetal (MGA), and mixtures thereof. One or more flavorants are<br>
optionally present in a total amount of about 0.01% to about 5%, optionally in various embodiments from about 0.05 to about 2%, from about 0.1% to about 2.5%, and from about 0.1 to about 0.5%.<br>
[0031]      Sweeteners among those useful herein include orally acceptable natural or artificial, nutritive or non-nutritive sweeteners. Such sweeteners include dextrose, polydextrose, sucrose, maltose, dextrin, dried invert sugar, mannose, xylose, ribose, fructose, levulose, galactose, corn syrup (including high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup solids), partially hydrolyzed starch, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, isomalt, aspartame, neotame, saccharin and salts thereof, sucralose, dipeptide-based intense sweeteners, cyciamates, dihydrochalcones, and mixtures thereof. One or more sweeteners are optionally present in a total amount depending strongly on the particular sweetener(s) selected, but typically at levels of from about 0.005% to about 5%, optionally from about 0.01% to about 1%.<br>
[0032]      Colorants among those useful herein include pigments, dyes, lakes and agents imparting a particular luster or reflectivity such as pearling agents. In various embodiments, colorants are operable to provide a white or light-colored coating on a dental surface, to act as an indicator of locations on a dental surface that have been effectively contacted by the composition, and/or to modify appearance, in particular color and/or opacity, of the composition to enhance attractiveness to the consumer. Any orally acceptable colorant can be used, including FD&amp;C dyes and pigments, talc, mica, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium silicate, magnesium aluminum silicate, silica,<br>

One or more colorants are optionally present in a total amount of about 0.001 % to about 20%, for example about 0.01 % to about 10% or about 0.1% to about 5%.<br>
Active Materials<br>
[0033]      The compositions of the present invention optionally comprise a fluoride ion providing material as an active material, which is operable for the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity, the prevention or treatment of a physiological disorder or condition, or to provide a cosmetic benefit. In various embodiments, the active is a "systemic active" which is operable to treat or prevent a disorder which, in whole or in part, is not a disorder of the oral cavity. In various embodiments, the active is an "oral care active" operable to treat or prevent a disorder or provide a cosmetic benefit within the oral cavity (e.g., to the teeth, gingiva or other hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity). Oral care actives among those useful herein include whitening agents, anticaries agents, tartar control agents, antiplaque agents, periodontal actives, abrasives, breath freshening agents, malodour control agents, tooth desensitizers, salivary stimulants, and combinations thereof. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of actives may differ, there may some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two or more of such categories of actives.<br>
 [0034]      Actives useful herein are present in the compositions of the present invention in safe and effective amounts. A "safe and effective" and "clinically efficacious" amount of an active is an amount that is sufficient to have the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in the human or lower animal subject to whom the active is administered, without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response), commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. The specific safe and effective ("clinically efficacious") amount of the active will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the subject, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific active used, the specific dosage form, the carrier employed, and the desired dosage regimen.<br>
[0035]      The compositions of the present invention further comprise an abrasive in the preferred form of calcium carbonate particulate. In various embodiments, an additional optional abrasive is useful for example as a polishing agent. Any orally acceptable abrasive can be used, but type, fineness (particle size) and amount of abrasive should be selected so that tooth enamel is not excessively abraded in normal use of the composition. Suitable optional abrasives include silica, for example in the form of precipitated silica or as admixed with alumina, insoluble phosphates, calcium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. Among insoluble phosphates useful as abrasives are orthophosphates, polymetaphosphates and pyrophosphates. Illustrative examples are dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, calcium pyrophosphate, calcium pyrophosphate,<br>
ricalcium phosphate, calcium polymetaphosphate and insoluble sodium polymetaphosphate.<br>
[0036]      The compositions of the present invention optionally comprise a tartar control (anticalculus) agent. Tartar control agents among those useful herein include salts of any of these agents, for example their alkali metal and ammonium salts: phosphates and polyphosphates (for example pyrophosphates), polyaminopropanesulfonic acid (AMPS), polyolefin sulfonates, polyolefin phosphates, diphosphonates such as azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonates (e.g., azacycloheptane-2,2-diphosphonic acid), N-methyl azacyclopentane-2,3-diphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid (EHDP) and ethane-1-amino-1,1-diphosphonate, phosphonoalkane carboxylic acids and. Useful inorganic phosphate and polyphosphate salts include monobasic, dibasic and tribasic sodium phosphates, sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrapolyphosphate, mono-, di-, tri- and tetrasodium pyrophosphates, sodium trimetaphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0037]      The compositions of the present invention comprise a fluoride ion source useful, for example, as an anti-caries agent. Any orally acceptable particulated fluoride ion source can be used, including potassium, sodium and ammonium fluorides and monofluorophosphates, stannous fluoride, indium fluoride, amine fluorides, including olaflur (N'-octadecyltrimethylendiamine-N,N,N'- tris(2-ethanol)-dihydrofluoride), and mixtures thereof. Particulate sodium monofluorophosphate, particulate sodium fluoride, particulate stannous fluoride, and combinations thereof are preferred. One or more fluoride ion sources are<br>
optionally present in an amount providing a clinically efficacious amount of soluble fluoride ion from about 500 to about 1500 ppm in any bed quantity of not less than about 1 gram.<br>
[0038]      The compositions of the present invention optionally comprise a saliva stimulating agent, useful for example in amelioration of dry mouth. Any orally acceptable saliva stimulating agent can be used, including without limitation food acids such as citric, lactic, malic, succinic, ascorbic, adipic, fumaric and tartaric acids, and mixtures thereof. One or more saliva stimulating agents are optionally present in a saliva stimulating effective total amount.<br>
[0039]      The compositions of the present invention optionally comprise a nutrient. Suitable nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and mixtures thereof. Vitamins include Vitamins C and D, thiamine, riboflavin, calcium pantothenate, niacin, folic acid, nicotinamide, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, para-aminobenzoic acid, bioflavonoids, and mixtures thereof. Nutritional supplements include amino acids (such as L-tryptophane, L-lysine, methionine, threonine, levocarnitine and L-carnitine), lipotropics (such as choline, inositol, betaine, and linoleic acid), and mixtures thereof.<br>
Methods of Manufacture<br>
[0040]      The toothpowder compositions of the present invention are made by methods; these methods including pulverizing (and, optionally, screen filtering) of oral care active particles so that all particles of oral care active are comparably sized to particles of their orally acceptable carrier bed such that a<br>
bed of admixed oral care active particulate and orally acceptable calcium carbonate particulate will not significantly differentiate the oral care active compositionally between any first 1 gram portion of the bed and any other 1 gram portion of the same bed. The methods also include mixing of the oral care active particulate and orally acceptable calcium carbonate particulate in a system such as a ribbon blender. In one embodiment, the oral care active particulate and orally acceptable calcium carbonate particulate are pulverized so that, in a bed having a volume of at least 125 cubic millimeters, at least 99 percent of individual calcium carbonate particles in the bed have an independent calcium carbonate particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns (preferably from about 13 to about 34 microns), at least 99 percent of individual fluoride ion source particulate particles in the set have an independent fluoride ion source particulate particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns (preferably from about 13 to about 34 microns), and any 125 cubic millimeter volumetric portion of the bed has a concentration of fluoride ion source providing from about 500 to about 1500 parts per million of soluble fluoride respective to calcium carbonate.<br>
[0041]      To achieve appropriate dispersion and utility, the particulates are also pulverized to a size that essentially precludes agglomeration between particulates in the bed that could confound comprehensive dispersion and mixing of the fluoride ion source particles into the orally acceptable carrier bed. In one embodiment, the bed is dried or otherwise treated to minimize surface tension between particles that could lead to such agglomeration.<br>
 [0042]      In one embodiment, a uniform dispersion of fluoride in the tooth powder and major abrasive is achieved, after adjusting of the particle size distribution of the oral care active particulate (fluoride ion source) to match the major abrasive (calcium carbonate particulate) particle size is first performed, by adding the fluoride ion source particulate into both ends of a ribbon blender mixer. In this regard, ribbon blenders have a U-shaped horizontal trough (with the U shape of the inner shell being apparent when viewed from the end cross section of the trough in parallel view along the trough axis) and a specially fabricated elongated ribbon agitator positioned to rotate about the trough axis in the generally semi-circular portion of the trough conformant to the lower part of the U. The ribbon agitator has at least one inner helical agitator and at least one outer helical agitator. In operation at least one helical agitator (ribbon) thereby rotates to "drive" material in the leftward (as viewed in trough axial cross section perpendicular to the trough axis) direction of the trough and at least one helical agitator (ribbon) rotates to "drive" material in the (opposite) rightward direction.<br>
[0043]      The trough (ribbon blender) has two ends (each conforming to the U shape in parallel view along the trough axis). In one embodiment, the abrasive particulate is charged to the ribbon blender, the charged abrasive particulate is then agitated, and the blending of fluoride ion source particulate and major abrasive particulate (calcium carbonate particulate) to fully disperse the oral care active particulate (fluoride ion source) is achieved by continuous addition of the fluoride ion source particulate over a period of time to both of the two ends of the ribbon blender during agitation of the calcium carbonate abrasive<br>
particulate. In this regard, addition at both ends appears to minimize challenges in localized concentration of the fluoride ion source particulate within the toothpowder.<br>
[0044]      Additional ingredients such as flavorant, coloring, and/or sweeteners are added at any point during the mixing process, but, in various embodiments, such ingredients are preferably added last or close to last.<br>
Methods of Use<br>
[0045]      The present invention provides methods for cleaning a tooth surface using compositions according to the present invention. As referred to herein, "tooth" or "teeth" refers to natural teeth, dentures, dental plates, fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, dental implants, and the like, and any other hard surfaced dental prosthesis either permanently or temporarily fixed within the oral cavity.<br>
[0046]      Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for cleaning a tooth surface, comprising applying to the surface a safe and effective amount of about 1 gram of aqueously moistened toothpowder and then agitating the aqueously moistened toothpowder against each surface of the tooth with a toothbrush. As referred to herein, "applying" refers to any method by which the toothpowder is placed in contact with the tooth surface.<br>
[0047]      In various embodiments, compositions of the present invention are also used for the treatment or prevention of disorders in the oral cavity, including cavity prevention, whitening, plaque prevention or reduction, gingivitis prevention or reduction, tartar control, sensitivity prevention or reduction, breath<br>
malodor prevention or reduction, and stain prevention. Compositions of the present invention may also be used for the treatment or prevention of systemic disorders, such as the improvement of overall systemic health characterized by a reduction in risk of development of systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, severe respiratory infection, premature and low birth weight infants (including associated post-partum dysfunction in neurologic/developmental function), and associated increased risk of mortality. Such methods include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0206874, Doyle et al., published November 6, 2003.<br>
[0048]      The present invention is further illustrated through the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0049]      A blend of PCC/NCC (precipitated calcium carbonate and natural calcium carbonate) particulate is admixed with a fluoride-ion source of sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP). Particle size of the PCC/NCC is screened so that 99 percent of the calcium carbonate particles have a particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns. The particle size distribution of SMFP is adjusted to match the PCC/NCC major abrasive so that 99 percent of the SMFP particles have a particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns. The PCC/NCC abrasive particulate is charged to the ribbon blender, and then agitated. Addition of SMFP particulate is done in a controlled manner at the two ends of the ribbon mixer at the rate of approximately 30gms /minute at the two<br>
ends of the ribbon blender. The entire addition time requires 25 - 30 minutes. Further interblending with additional PCC/NCC abrasive particulate (via addition at both ends) is done and kept under mixing for 50 minutes to provide a tooth powder containing not more than 1000 ppm active fluoride. Samples are taken from different locations of the blender at regular intervals during the mixing operation to validate the uniform dispersion of SMFP in the toothpowder. Sodium lauryl sulfate, saccharin, and flavor are then intermixed to provide a final toothpowder product.<br>
Example 2:<br>
[0050]       An intra-oral remineralization-demineralization study is conducted to compare the ability of three toothpowders to promote the hardening of caries-like lesions in enamel. The products evaluated in this study are Toothpowder 1 formulated as essentially described in Example 1, a first commercially-available non-fluorinated toothpowder identified as Toothpowder 2, and a second commercially-available non-fluorinated toothpowder identified as Toothpowder 3. The study design is a double-blind, cross-over with random product assignment. Each product is used twice a day for two weeks. The efficacy of each product is determined by measuring its ability to promote the hardening of partially demineralized blocks of enamel implanted in partial lower mandibular dentures during the two week treatment period. Enamel hardness is<br>
measured using a Knoop micro hardness tester. Results are reported as percent changes in hardness before and after treatment. Twenty nine panelists participate in the study.<br>
[0051]       The results of the study are shown in Table 1.<br>
(Table removed)<br><br>
[0052]        A different letter (A or B) indicates a different statistical group in the above table. All three toothpowders promote a net increase in hardness of enamel. A statistical analysis consisting of a two factor ANOVA with the treatment and subject as factors followed by a Tukey multiple T-test is conducted. The results of the analysis show that Toothpowder 1 with fluoride is significantly better than Toothpowder 2 (p = 0.03) and Toothpowder 3 (p = 0.01) at promoting the hardening of partially demineralized enamel. No significant difference is observed between Toothpowder 2 and Toothpowder 3 (p = 0.9).<br>
The results of this study show that Toothpowder 1 with fluoride performs significantly better at hardening enamel with caries-like lesions than Toothpowder 2 and Toothpowder 3.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0053]        An evaluation of robustness in dispersion of fluoride is tested<br>
by preparing samples of toothpowder having fully dispersed fluoride according to<br>
the procedure of Example 1, packaging the toothpowder samples in cans that are<br>
appropriately sized for consumer consumption, shipping the canned samples for<br>
a distance of more than 2000 Km, and evaluating the samples for dispersion of<br>
the fluoride in the toothpowder after the shipping operation. The evaluations<br>
indicate that the dispersion of the fluoride remains uniform in the shipped<br>
samples.<br>
[0054]        The examples and other embodiments described herein are exemplary and not intended to be limiting in describing the full scope of compositions and methods of this invention. Equivalent changes, modifications and variations of specific embodiments, materials, compositions and methods may be made within the scope of the present invention, with substantially similar results.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
