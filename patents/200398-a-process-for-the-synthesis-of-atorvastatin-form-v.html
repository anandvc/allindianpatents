FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for manufacturing R-(R*,R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-B,D-dihydroxy-5-(l-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-l -heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt, atorvastatin form V and the novel intermediates produced during the course of manufacture. The said compound is useful as inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase and are thus useful as hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
US Patent. No. 4,681,893, discloses a route using resolution of the racemic product using R {+) a-methyl benzyl amine. US patent No. 5,003,080 discloses a synthetic route lor the preparation of the chiral form of atorvastatin. The patent discloses a process for the preparation of the lactone or its salts by coupling an ester of (4R)-6-(2-aminoethyl)-2,2-dialkyl-1.3-dioxane-3-acetate with 4-fluoro-α-[2-methyl-l-oxopropyl]7-oxo-N-P-diplienylbenzenebutaneamide followed by deprotection and hydrolysis to give the product. The product suffers from the fact ozonolysis is required as one of the steps for the synthesis of the amino ketal intermediate, which is hazardous for large scale preparation. The patent describes an alternate procedure wherein 4-fluoro-a-[2-methyl-l-oxopropyl]Y-oxo-N-|3-diphenylbenzenebutaneamide is reacted with 3-amino propinaldehyde acetal followed by conventional procedures to give atorvastatin,<br>
US patent No. 5,216,174, No. 5,097,045, No. 5,103,024, No. 5,124,482, No. 5.149.837,No. 5,155,251, No. 5,216,174, No. 5,245,047, No. 5,273,995, No.5,248,793, and  No.5.397 J92 describes various minor modifications in the procedure for the preparation of atorvastatin calcium salt.<br>
Synthesis of esters of (4R)-6-(2-aminoethyl)-2,2-dialkyl-l,3-dioxane-3-acetate is an important part of the preparation of atorvastatin calcium. US patent 5,155,251 also discloses a synthetic route for the synthesis of (3R)-4-Cyano-3-hydroxy butyric acid esters from (S)-3-hydroxy butyolactone, which in turn is synthesized from a suitable carbohydrate substrate.<br>
Other patents like 5,292,939, 5,319,110 and 5,374,773 discloses the preparation of 3.4-dihydroxybutyric acid. However, isolation of this highly water soluble compound or its lactone is not attempted.<br><br>
Another multi step procedure starting from (S)-malic acid (J. org. Chem., 1981, 46, 4319) is reported. Esters of (S)-malic acid have also been used (Chem. Lett., 1984, 1389) for the synthesis of the hydroxy lactone involving BMS-NaBH4 reduction, followed by lactonization. While a six step procedure from D-isoascorbic acid is also reported (Syn., 1987, 570) but this process requires a silica gel chromatographic separation of the diasteromic mixtures.<br>
Optical resolution of the racemic hydroxylactones using lipase is disclosed in US patent 5,084,392 but this method suffers from poor enatiomeric excess and loss of the other active isomer.<br>
Thus, these prior art procedures involves cumbersome reaction conditions or expensive starting materials, reagents which are difficult to handle or hazardous for scale up. coupled with a multi step procedure which results in poor overall yield.<br>
The object of the present invention is to disclose an inexpensive, simple and scalable route for the synthesis of atorvastatin form V. PCT pending application filed on March 28, 2000 (PCT/INOO/00030) discloses a process for the synthesis but uses a different amino acid fragment for the condensation reaction to get atorvastatin calcium. Reference is also made to co- pending application filed on January 19, 2001 (PCT/INO1/00006) claims the form V polymorph of atorvastatin calcium.<br>
