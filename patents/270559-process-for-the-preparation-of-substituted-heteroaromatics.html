				<td>Process for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics. The improvement over the processes known hitherto consists in the improvement in the selectivity.<br>
Substituted heteroaromatics are valuable intermediates in the electronic industry. They are used, for example, in the application areas of illumination, solar cells and displays and create new possibilities as regards design, processing and energy efficiency. Compared to established products, they moreover offer economic incentives since their preparation is significantly less complex. In particular, on account of their property of building up conjugated double bonds after polymerization, thiophenes can be used in various structural elements of the specified applications.<br>
The first process for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics starting from halogenated aromatics and Grignard reagents was developed by Kumada et al. {Tetrahedron 1982, 38, 3347-3354). Here, a wide variety of alkyl and aryl radicals were introduced into various positions of thiophenes, pyridines and quinolines. Polyalkylations were also carried out by reacting polyhalogenated heteroaromatics with Grignard compounds with nickel catalysis. Diethyl ether was used as solvent for these reactions. Disadvantages are not only the use of the low-boiling diethyl ether which has a strong tendency to form peroxide, but also that in this process significant amounts of the homocoupling products (e.g. dithiophene in the case of the reaction of 3-bromothiophene with n-hexylmagnesium bromide) are formed, which make further purification difficult.<br>
Furthermore, Synth. Commim. 1986,16, 689-696 by Zimmer et al. describes the Kumada coupling of bromothiophene with alkylmagnesium halides. Here, inter alia, the coupling of 3-bromothiophene with n-hexylmagnesium bromide is carried out in diethyl ether; the authors obtained an isolated yield of 71%.<br>
US 2006/0155134 discloses that Kumada couplings of 3-halothiophenes with alkyl- and arylmagnesium halides can be carried out in methyltetrahydrofurans. The procedure in this solvent reduces the by-product spectrum compared with the processes which use e.g. diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. A disadvantage of this process is that isomeric, branched secondary components are produced in the order of magnitude around 0.5%.<br>
US 2006/0155134 describes that the use of tert-butyl methyl ether during the described Kumada coupling of an alkyl radical onto 3-halothiophenes produces a poor result with regard to the secondary component spectrum, in particular in the formation of dithiophenes.<br>
It was an object to develop an improved process for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics<br>
which leads to fewer secondary components.<br>
The invention therefore provides a process for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics of the general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed) where<br>
X	is oxygen, sulphur or NR5 where R5 is hydrogen, C1-C20-alkyl or C5-C6-aryl and<br>
R4	is C1-C20-alkyl, C5-C6-aryl or heteroaryl,<br>
R1, R2, R3	is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C20-alkyl, C5-C6-aryl or heteroaryl, by reaction<br>
A)	of a halogenated heteroaromatic of the general formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed) where<br>
X	has the meaning given for formula (I) and<br>
R6	is bromine, iodine or chlorine and<br>
R1, R2 and R3    have the meaning given for formula (I),<br>
with a Grignard reagent of the general formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed) where<br>
R4        has the meaning given for formula (I) and<br>
Hal      is bromine, iodine or chlorine or<br>
B)	reaction of the halogenated heteroaromatics of the formula (II) with magnesium firstly to<br>
give a Grignard compound of the general formula (IIIa)<br><br>
(Formula Removed) where<br>
Hal      is bromine, iodine or chlorine and<br>
X and R1, R2 and R3 have the meaning given for formula (I),<br>
and further reaction with a halogenated compound of the general formula (IV)<br>
where <br>
R4        has the meaning given for formula (I) and<br>
Hal      is bromine, iodine or chlorine,<br>
where the reactions A) or B) are in each case carried out in the presence of an Ni or Pd catalyst, characterized in that the process is carried out in the presence of cycloalkyl alkyl ether as solvent and optionally one or more further solvents.<br>
The cycloalkyl alkyl ether is preferably cyclopentyl methyl ether.<br>
The catalyst used is a nickel or palladium compound, preferably a nickel(II) chloride, particularly preferably [l,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride, in a stoichiometry of 0.001-20 mol%, preferably 0.05-1.5 mol%, particularly preferably 0.1-0.5 mol%.<br>
Magnesium is used in a stoichiometry of 80-150 mol%, preferably 100-140 mol%, particularly preferably 105-130 mol%.<br>
The alkyl halide or aryl halide of the general formula (IV) forming the Grignard reagent has a stoichiometry of 80-150 mol%, preferably 100-140 mol%, particularly preferably 105-130 mol%.<br>
The solution of the Grignard reagent of the general formula (HI) should have a concentration of 0.1-4 mol/1, preferably 0.5-4 mol/1, particularly preferably 1.5-3.5 mol/1.<br>
The process according to the invention is, as is customary in the case of Grignard reactions, carried out under inert conditions. For example, the apparatus used for the reaction is heated if required and filled with nitrogen or argon. The inert atmosphere is maintained also during the addition of<br>
raw materials and the removal of samples, where in particular freedom from water is to be respected.<br>
In the present process, magnesium is preferably initially introduced into cyclopentyl methyl ether in a synthesis apparatus. Here, the magnesium can be used, for example, in the form of pieces, filings, granules or powder or mixtures of these use forms. The concentration of magnesium in cyclopentyl methyl ether according to the invention is 0.1-4 mol/1, preferably 0.5-4 mol/1, particularly preferably 1.5-3.5 mol/1. It is also possible to initially introduce magnesium into a mixture of cyclopentyl methyl ether with another solvent, for example, but not limited to: toluene, but also ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, methyltetrahydrofuran, tert-butyl methyl ether or diethyl ether or mixtures of the aforementioned solvents.<br>
An alkyl halide or aryl halide of the general formula (IV) or (II) as described above is then reacted with the magnesium to give a Grignard reagent of the formula (III) or (IIIa). Here, alkyl is an alkyl group having C1-C20, preferably C4-C20, particularly preferably C4-C10 and aryl is preferably of the formula (II), particular preference being given to using monohalogenated, alkylated thiophenes or dihalogenated dithiophenes. In both cases, the halogens are preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, particularly preferably bromine.<br>
The alkyl halide or aryl halide can be added pure or diluted in a solvent. Solvents are, for example, cyclopentyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methyltetrahydrofuran, tert-butyl methyl ether, diethyl ether, toluene or mixtures of the aforementioned solvents. The molarity of the Grignard reagent is preferably 0.5-4 mol/1, particularly preferably 1.5-3.5 mol/1.<br>
The general properties of Grignard reagents apply for Grignard reagents used in the process according to the invention. They are sensitive to air and water and should thus be handled and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere or noble gas atmosphere. Storage should generally be kept as short as possible, i.e. the Grignard reagents should if possible be freshly prepared. Furthermore, the reaction of Grignard reagents with water is highly exothermic and hydrogen is released. For this reason, containers of Grignard reagents should be protected against the entry of water.<br>
The Grignard reagents of the formula (III) or (IIIa) used in the process according to the invention enter in the course of the reaction into a transition-metal-catalysed reaction with a halide of the general formula (IV) or a halogenated heteroaromatic of the general formula (II) having the radicals as described above. Here, the halogen of the halide is replaced by the corresponding group of the Grignard reagent. Preference is given here to reaction A) in which R6 is exchanged for R4 from the Grignard reagent.<br>
The catalyst for the process described in this invention can be nickel or palladium in oxidation<br>
state 0 or II, i.e. Ni(II), Ni(O), Pd(II) or Pd(O). For this process, preference is given to<br>
[l,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride and nickel dichloride and mixtures thereof<br>
or suspensions of one of the catalysts or suspensions of mixtures of these catalysts. It is also<br>
possible to use further preferred nickel catalysts from the group consisting of: nickel(II) acetate,<br>
[l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane]nickel(II) chloride, hexaamminenickel(II) chloride, nickel(H)<br>
acetylacetonate, or complexes of nickel(II) acetylacetonate with tri-tert-butylphosphine,<br>
1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolidinium	chloride,	1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-<br>
imidazolidinium chloride, 1,3-diadamantylimidazolium chloride, triadamantylphosphine,<br>
l,3,4-triphenyl-4,5-dihydro-lH-l,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene,	1,1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene,<br>
2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl, and also combinations of all of the aforementioned catalysts and their suspensions. In the process of the present invention, particular preference is given to the use of [l,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride in the form of a suspension or as pure feed material.<br>
In the present invention, e.g. [l,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride is added as solid or suspension to the Grignard solution prepared as described above. It is also possible to add the Grignard solution to a suspension of the catalyst in cyclopentyl methyl ether or another suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methyltetrahydrofuran, tert-buty\ methyl ether, dioxane, toluene or diethyl ether or mixtures of all of the aforementioned solvents. Also, the halogenated heteroaromatic may already be dissolved in this suspension. In the particularly preferred procedure, however, [l,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride without further solvent is metered into the Grignard reagent. The amount of catalyst required is between 0.001-20mol%, preferably 0.05-1.5 mol%, particularly preferably 0.1-0.5 mol%. The concentration of the possible catalyst suspension is between 20 and 80 % by weight in the suitable solvent.<br>
The reaction of the Grignard reagent with the halide R4Hal of the above-described general formula (IV) is initiated by adding the halide to the mixture, prepared as described above, of Grignard reagent with catalyst. It can likewise be brought about by adding the Grignard reagent to a mixture of the halide and catalyst in cyclopentyl methyl ether or a mixture of cyclopentyl methyl ether and a further solvent. In the present procedure, preference is given to the dropwise addition of a halogenated heteroaromatic to a mixture of the corresponding Grignard reagent and [l,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride in cyclopentyl methyl ether.<br>
Preferably, X in formula (I), (II) and (IIIa) is sulphur, i.e. the halide of the formula (II) used is preferably a substituted or unsubstituted halothiophene, preferably a chlorothiophene, bromothiophene or iodothiophene, particularly preferably bromothiophene, very particularly preferably 3-bromothiophene. It can be used pure or in solvents, for example toluene, cyclopentyl methyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or methyltetrahydrofuran.<br>
The ratio of Grignard reagent to halogenated heteroaromatic can be 80-150 mol%, preference being given to using 100-140 mol%, particularly preferably 105-130 mol%.<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are preferably hydrogen and R4 is preferably a C1-C12-alkyl group. R4 is particularly preferably a C6-C10- or C12-alkyl group (hexyl group, decyl group, dodecyl group). Consequently, thiophenes substituted with a hexyl group, decyl group, dodecyl group, in particular thiophenes substituted in the 3 position, are prepared according to the invention. Here, 3-hexylthiophene is very particularly preferred.<br>
Following initiation of the reaction, the reaction temperature is controlled through the rate of the dropwise addition and counter cooling. The reaction temperature should be between -30 and 106°C (boiling point of cyclopentyl methyl ether), temperatures are preferably between 10 and 90°C, the temperature fluctuations are particularly preferably between 15 and 70°C.<br>
The process offers an option of converting halogenated heteroaromatics into substituted heteroaromatics in a virtually complete conversion without, in so doing, obtaining isomeric secondary components, such as e.g. in the case of the reaction of 3-bromothiophene with hexylmagnesium bromide the isomer 3-(l-methylpentyl)thiophene, in noteworthy amounts. Surprisingly, during this reaction, when using cyclopentyl methyl ether or mixtures of cyclopentyl methyl ether with other solvents, only very small amounts of dithiophenes are formed. Moreover, compared with the use of methyltetrahydrofurans, the use of cyclopentyl methyl ether offers the advantage that a considerably smaller fraction of the undesired secondary component 3-(l-methylpentyl)thiophene is found in the crude mixture.<br>
Thus, starting from the same batch of n-hexyl bromide, the following comparative values have been found:<br>
(Table Removed) The selectivity of the coupling with regard to the formation of the secondary component 3-(l-methylpentyl)thiophene in the case of the process presented here is clearly superior to that already known.<br>
Furthermore, cyclopentyl methyl ether offers a number of further advantages compared with other ethers. Examples to be mentioned here are the higher boiling point and also the mixing behaviour with water, which is of great importance for organometallic reactions:<br>
(Table Removed) The low tendency to form peroxide also characterizes cyclopentyl methyl ether as a safer-to-handle solvent for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics, in particular substituted thiophenes.<br>
The invention therefore further provides the use of cycloalkyl alkyl ethers, in particular cyclopentyl methyl ether, in the Kumada reaction for the preparation of substituted heteroaromatics, in particular substituted thiophenes.<br>
