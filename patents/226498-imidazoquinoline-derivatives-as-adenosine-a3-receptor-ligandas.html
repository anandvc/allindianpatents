				<td>IMIDAZOQUINOLINE DERIVATIVES AS ADENOSINE A3 RECEPTOR LIGANDS<br>
The present invention relates to the adenosine A3 receptor ligands of the<br>
general formula (I),<br><br>
within those preferably to the antagonists, as well as to their salts, solvates and<br>
isomers, to the pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to the use of the<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) and their salts, solvates and isomers, and to<br>
the preparation of the compounds of the general formula (I) and their salts, solvates<br>
and isomers.<br>
Adenosine is a well-known component of several endogenous molecules<br>
(ATP, NAD+, nucleic acids). Besides, it plays an important regulatory role in many<br>
physiological processes. The effect of adenosine on heart function was discovered<br>
already in 1929. (Drury and Szentgyorgyi, J Physiol 68:213, 1929). The<br>
identification of an increasing number of physiological functions mediated by<br>
adenosine and the discovery of new adenosine receptor subtypes give possibilities<br>
for therapeutic application of specific ligands (Poulse, S. A. and Quinn, R. J.<br>
Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 6:619, 1998)<br><br>
To date, the receptors for adenosine have been classified into three main<br>
classes: A1, A2 and A3. The A1 subtype is partly responsible for the inhibition of the<br>
adenylate cyclase by coupling to G1 membrane protein, partly influences other<br>
second messenger systems. The A2 receptor subtype can be subdivided into two<br>
further subtypes - A2a and A2b -, which stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity. The<br>
sequence of adenosine A3 receptors have been recently identified from rat testis<br>
cDNA library. Later it was proved that it corresponds to a novel, functional<br>
adenosine receptor. The activation of the A3 receptors is connected also with several<br>
second-messenger systems: inhibiting of adenylate cyclase, stimulating<br>
phospholipase C and D.<br>
The adenosine receptors are found in several organs and regulate their<br>
functions. Both A1 and A2a receptors play important role in the central nervous<br>
system and cardiovascular system. In the CNS, the adenosine inhibits the release of<br>
synaptic transmitters which effect is mediated by A1 receptors. In the heart, also the<br>
 A1 receptors mediate the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of<br>
adenosine. The adenosine A2a receptors, which are located in a relatively high<br>
amount in the striatum, display functional interaction with the dopamine receptors in<br>
regulating the synaptic transmission. The A2a adenosine receptors on endothelial and<br>
smooth muscle cells are responsible for adenosine-induced vasodilation.<br>
On the basis of mRNA identification, the A2b adenosine receptors are widely<br>
distributed in different tissues. They have been identified almost in every cell type,<br>
but its expression is the highest in the intestine and the bladder. This subtype<br>
probably also has important regulatory function in the regulation of the vascular<br>
tone and plays a role in the function of mast cells.<br>
Contrary to A1 and A2a receptors, where the tissue distribution was detected<br>
on the protein level, the presence of A2b and A3 receptors was detected on the basis<br>
of their mRNA level. Expression levels for A3 adenosine receptors are rather low<br>
compared to other subtypes and are highly species dependent. A3 adenosine<br>
receptors are expressed primarily in the central nervous system, testis and immune<br><br>
system, and appear to be involved in the modulation of mediator release from mast<br>
cells in immediate hypersensitivity reaction.<br>
The A3 antagonists published so far in the literature belong to the groups of<br>
flavonoides,	1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives, triazoloquinazolines,<br>
thiazolonaphthyridines and thiazolopyrimidines. The present invention relates to a<br>
novel type of effective A3 antagonists, which have the aminoquinoline structure.<br>
For therapeutic use it is essential to ensure that the molecule does not bind, or<br>
bind only in the case of very high concentration, to the A1, A2a and A2b sub-types of<br>
the adenosine receptor. Our present invention relates to the compounds of the<br>
general formula (I) as well as their salts, solvates and isomers, which have great<br>
selectivity for the A3 sub-type of the adenosine receptor.<br>
Our aim was to prepare A3 ligands, within them preferably antagonists, first<br>
of all with quinoline structure, which exert strong antagonistic effect and high<br>
selectivity for the A3 receptor, i.e. they inhibit the A3 receptor in much lower<br>
concentration than they inhibit the A1, A2a and A2b receptors. Further aims were to<br>
have stability, bioavailability, therapeutic index and toxicity data, enabling these<br>
new compounds to develop into drug substances, and that the new compounds<br>
possess favourable enteric absorption to be applied orally.<br>

The compounds having selective activity on the A3 receptor can be used in<br>
the therapeutic and/or preventive treatment of disfunctions of the heart, kidney,<br>
respiratory system, central nervous system. They block the protective effect of<br>
adenosine on the growing tumoric cells, prevent degranulation of the mast cells,<br>

therapeutically useful as antiinflammatory, antiasthmatic, antiischemic,<br>
antidepressive, antiarrhythmic, kidney function protective, tumor preventing,<br>
antiparkinson and cognitive function stimulating drugs. They may also be useful in<br>
the treatment or prevention of the following diseases: injury of the heart muscle<br>

respiratory insufficiency (ARDS) - including chronic bronchitis, pulmonary<br>
emphysema or difficult breathing -, allergic reactions (e.g. rhinitis, poison ivy-<br>

disease and on the sex, weight etc. of the patient.<br><br>
A further subject of the invention is the preparation of the compounds of the<br>
general formula (I).<br>
The substituents in the formulae of the intermediates of the general formulae<br>

In the process according to our invention the compounds of the general<br>
formula (VIII)<br><br>
are acylated with the acids or their reactive derivatives of the general formula (II),<br><br>
by applying an acylation method known in the organic chemistry. As for acylating<br>

transformed into each other, by known methods.<br>
The mixed anhydride used for the acylation reaction can be prepared with<br>
pivaloyl chloride, favourably by using organic bases dissolved in chloroform,<br>
preferably by using triethylamine, but other methods known in the organic chemistry<br>
can also be applied. Acylation can be performed in a broad temperature range,<br>
preferably between 0 °C and 100 °C.<br>

demonstrated in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
starting from the compounds of the general formula (III)<br><br>
and applying a hydrolysis method known in the organic chemistry. As for<br>
hydrolysing agent alkali hydroxides can be used, but other compounds promoting<br>
the hydrolysis of esters can also be applied.<br>

Results<br>
We consider the compounds as biologically actives ones if they inhibit the<br>
binding of the radioligand on human adenosine A3 receptors with an activity above<br>
80 % at 1 uM in our experimental conditions.<br>
The dissociation constant (Kd) of [I23I]AB-MECA on CPIO-hA3 membrane<br>
preparation is determined by isotope saturation studies with the help of Scatchard<br>
analysis (G. Scatchard, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660, 1949). The IC50 is converted<br>
to an affinity constant (Ki) by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Y. J.<br>
Cheng and W. H. Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22:3099, 1973).<br><br>
Several compounds of the general formula (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) display<br>
remarkable biological effects. Most important activities are exhibited by the<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) defined in claims 1-3. Especially<br>
advantageous are the compounds given in the Examples, their Kj values are in the<br>
range of 0.8 nM and 700 nM. Ki values of the most advantageous compounds are<br>
0.8 and 15nM.<br>
The compounds possess proper bioavailability and a selectivity of at least 3<br>
order of magnitude, in respect of the human adenosine A1, A2a and A2b receptor<br>
subtypes.<br>
Further, the duration of their action at intravenous and oral administration is<br>
long, their ED50 values are low, their toxicological and side-effect profiles are<br>
advantageous.<br>
These above data favour the therapeutic application of the compounds of the<br>
general formula (I).<br><br>
