THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
23 JUL 2005<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
This invention relates to an anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) composition and method of making the same.<br>
This invention relates to a process for making a pharmaceutical solid oral dosage form in tablet form containing glycopyrrolate.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of glycopyrrolate used in the formulation is preferably in it"s pure form as glycopyrrolate or stereochemical pure form of it or any pharmaceutically acceptable form of it.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glycopyrrolate is chemically a tertiary amine salt of bromide and described as follows:<br>
Pyrrolidinium, 3-[(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl)oxy]-l,l-dimethyl bromide.<br>
3-Hydroxy - 1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium bromide oc-cyclo pentyl mandelate.<br>
It has a molecular weight of 398.34 and molecular formula is C19H28BrNO3. The structure is as follows:<br><br>
Glycopyrrolate, like other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic<br><br><br>
effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions.<br>
Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases.<br>
The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily.<br>
Glycopyrollate is indicated for use as a preoperative antimuscarinic to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions; to reduce the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions; and to block cardiac vagal inhibitory reflexes during induction of anesthesia and intubation.<br>
PHARMACOKINETICS<br>
The following pharmacokinetic information and conclusions were obtained from published studies that used non specific assay methods.<br>
Distribution: The mean volume of distribution of glycopyrrolate was estimated to be 0.42 + 0.22L/kg.<br>
Metabolism: The in vivo metabolism of glycopyrrolate in humans has not been studied.<br><br><br>
Excretion The mean clerance and mean TV2 values were reported to be 0.54+ 0.14 L/kg/hr and 0.83+0.13 hr, respectively post IV administration. After of a 0.2 mg mg radiolabeled glycopyrrolate, 85% of dose recovered was recovered in urine 48 hours postdose and some of radioactivity was also recovered in bile. After IM adminstration to adults, the mean TYz value is reported to be between 0.55 to 1.25 hrs. Over 80% of IM dose administered was recovered in urine and the bile as unchanged drug and half the IM dose is excreted within 3 hrs. The following table summarizes the mean and standard deviation of pharmacokinetic parameters from a study.<br>

SPECIAL POPULATIONS<br>
Gender: Gender differences in pharmacokinetics of glycopyrrolate have not been investigated<br>
Renal Impairment: in one study glycopyrrolate was administered IV in uremic significantly longer (46.8 minutes) than in healthy patients (18.6 minutes). The mean  area-under-the-concentration-time   curve   (10.6   hr-   g/L),   mean  lasma<br><br><br>
clearance (0.43 L/hr/kg), and mean 3-hour urine excretion (0.7%) was also significantly different than those of controls (3.73 hr- g/L, 1.14 L/hr/kg, and 50%, respectively). These results suggest that the elimination of glycopyrrolate is severely impaired in patients with renal failure.<br>
Pediatrics: Following IV administration (5mg/kg glycopyrrolate) to infants and children, the mean T Vi values were reported to be between 21.6 and 130.0 minutes and between 19.2 and 99.2 minutes, respectively.<br>
The main feature of this invention is the use of the active ingredient for making a form of tablet of the active molecule glycopyrrolate in which the tablet is dissolved easily in the mouth to release the drug instantly with improved bioavailability.<br>
