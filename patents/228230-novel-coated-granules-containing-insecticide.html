Still another object of the invention is to provide a formulation of the said insecticide which does not stick to the container or application device and thus ensures easy cleaning thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the novel formulation of l-(6-chloro-3-pyridin-3ylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-yldenamine coated granules, which is coherent and free flowing, which can be directly applied to the field without diluting aid. The product of the present invention has several advantages such as ease of handling and use, and improved shelf life. In addition to its efficacy, the invented formulation is also preferred due to its flowability and non dusty granular nature resistant to crushing and attrition.<br>
The present formulation of the l-(6-chloro-3-pyridin-3ylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-yldenamine coated granules comprises the active ingredient along with necessary formulation adjuvants such as wetting agents, binding agents, plasticizing agents, carriers and film forming agents.<br>
The product of present invention can be prepared by a method<br>
comprising	blending	the	l-(6-chloro-3-pyridin-3ylmethyl)-N-<br>
nitroimidazolidin-2-yldenamine active ingredient with formulation adjuvants in stipulated quantities and to form an aqueous sprayable mixture, spraying the above mentioned mixture on silica or sand for uniform coating, drying the said granules by drying means, again spraying the film forming solution on the dried granules prepared as mentioned above, again drying the coated granules to get the desired formulation. Active ingredient content of the product was determined by BIS method.<br><br><br>
Wetting agents are used for instant wetting of the active ingredient in the formulation once added to water. They decrease the interfacial tension between the solid ingredient [in this case l-(6-chloro-3-pyridin-3ylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-yldenamine active ingredient] and water. Wetting agents can be chosen from the group comprising of condensates of alkyl aryl sulfonic acid, condensate of alkyl naphthalene sulfonate, condensate of aryl sulfonic acid, sodium or potassium polycarboxylates, ethoxylated tristeryl phenol phosphates and their salts, or ammonium salt of polyoxyethylene or a combination of these and castor oil ethoxylates.<br>
Preferably, the wetting agent in the present invention is chosen from the group comprising of castor oil ethoxylates, hereinafter referred to as Adjuvant A.<br>
Binding agents or adhesives are used to hold the active ingredients along with other adjuvants strongly in the granules, so that they withstand handling and transportation. Binding agents are used in the formulation to make the granules strong to resist abrasion or physical disintegration. Various classes of binding agents can be chosen from the group consisting of polymers and copolymers of poly vinyl acetate, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, vinylidine chloride, cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and poly saccharide.<br>
Preferable binder for the present invention is vinyl alcohol polymer (Polyvinyl alcohol), hereinafter referred to as Adjuvant B.<br>
Plasticizers are typically used in the insecticidal solution to make the film that is formed by the insecticidal coating layer more flexible, improve adhesion and spreadability.    Various plasticizers may be used such as<br><br><br>
polyethylene glycol, Tri hydroxy alcohol (Glycerol), Butyl benzyl phthalate, Glycol benzoates and related compounds.<br>
Preferred plasticizer for the present invention is Glycerol, herein referred to as Adjuvant C.<br>
Film forming agents form a temporary protective coating layer on the desired material. Film over coating can be applied to the insecticide coated granules of the present invention. The film overcoats protect the insecticide granules from mechanical damage during transportation, storage and handling. Moreover, it also makes the formulation safe to handle and use during application.<br>
Various film forming agents including but not limited to methyl cellulose, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose, dextrin, gums, waxes, vegetable oils or paraffin oils, synthetic polymers such as polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, Polyvinyl pyrrolidone and their copolymers and related polymers and mixtures of these are suitable.<br>
Preferred film forming agent used in the present invention is vinyl alcohol polymer (polyvinyl alcohol) which is adjuvant B.<br>
Preferred carrier material used in the present invention is silica or sand having particle size preferably between 16-40 mesh herein referred to as adjuvant D.<br>
Optionally, a coloring agent may also be added to the formulation. Preferred coloring agent used in the present invention Malachite Green herein referred to as Adjuvant E.<br><br><br>
