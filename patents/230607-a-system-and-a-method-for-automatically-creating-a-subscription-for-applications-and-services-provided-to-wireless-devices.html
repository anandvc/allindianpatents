BACKGROUNIQ) OF THE INVENTION<br>
/.        Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention generally relates to wireless telecommunications and<br>
computer networks. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and<br>
method for providing an infrastructure to support an automatic subscription of wireless<br>
devices and an end-to-end billing arrangement for services provided to wireless device<br>
service subscribers by network carriers and third parties.<br>
U.       Descriptionof the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Wireless devices, such as cellular telephones, communicate packets including<br>
voice and data over a wireless network. In existing wireless telecommunication systems,<br>
such as cellular telecommunication systems, a wireless service provider or carrier has<br>
wireless service subscribers that pay the provider for the time that the wireless device of<br>
the subscriber accesses the cellular network. Fees are typically charged to the<br>
subscriber for the initial activation of a telecommunication device and then fees can be<br>
charged for ongoing airtime and device usage. However, existing systems typically do<br>
not account for other activities at the telecommunication device beyond airtime usage.<br>
[0003]	Further, if the subscriber of the wireless device desires to download and use a<br>
software appHcation or upgrade the functionality of the telecommunication device, the<br>
user will typically either call a service provider or contact the service provider through<br>
another electronic means, such as through a separate Internet access. In some instances,<br>
the service provider can transmit the application to the wireless device across the<br>
wireless network (through a one time direct access download) or allow the user access a<br>
network site with the wireless device through the wireless network and at such site the<br>
application is downloadable or accessible to the subscriber. Otherwise service<br>
personnel of the provider must have physical access to the telecommunication device to<br>
install the software or upgrade the components thereof<br>
[0004]	Further, the proliferation of computer technology has made it easier and cheaper<br>
to develop software application. A computer programmer can easily develop a video<br>
game or a utility appHcation on a personal computer, and the programmer can tailor the<br>
game to run on different computer hardware platforms including on a wireless handset.<br><br>
However, the individual application developer encounters difficulty in getting the<br>
product to market, especially for applications that are executable on wireless devices.<br>
The developer must first create a full version of the application and then sell it to the<br>
carriers in order to derive any income. Consequently, creating application for the<br>
wireless device market is a huge investment by the developer without the guarantee of<br>
return.<br>
[0005]	Wireless telecommunications carriers may rely on independent developers to<br>
develop apphcations for their users, but this arrangement would create new problems<br>
for the carriers. Now, the carriers, instead of hiring many developers, needs to track<br>
usages of products developed by these independent developers and pay them<br>
accordingly, which can be a huge task itself.<br>
[0006]	Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method that<br>
handles end-to-end billing for carriers. Such system should allow wireless services<br>
provides to deliver value-added products and services to their subscribers beyond<br>
simple airtime, and allow the application developer to receive payments for their<br>
products. It is thus to such a system and method for automatically managing<br>
subscription billing for wireless device subscribers that the present invention is<br>
primarily directed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	The present invention discloses a system, method, and computer program that<br>
automatically manages an application or service subscription price plan for applications<br>
and services provided to wireless devices firom other computer devices on a wireless<br>
network during wireless device end-user interaction with the computer devices. Once an<br>
appHcation or subscription is activated, the subscription requires periodic payment (such<br>
as monthly) by the wireless device carrier service subscriber (who is not necessarily the<br>
end-user at the wireless device interacting on the network) for continued access to the<br>
application or service. The wireless device end-user interaction with other computer<br>
devices, such as appUcation download servers, is monitored, either directly if the<br>
interaction is with the same server that records appHcation or service subscription data,<br>
or across the wireless network when the end-user obtains an application or service from<br>
another computer device. The application or service subscription can either be billed<br>
directly to the wireless device subscriber for the subscription(s) or a bill transmitted to<br><br>
the carrier or other entity to bill the subscriber. In one embodiment, the system includes<br>
one or more wireless devices selectively in communication with other computer devices<br>
across a wireless network, where each wireless device has an end-user thereof and a<br>
computer platform that is able to selectively download and ejcecute software<br>
applications thereupon and is accessible by the end-user. At least one server is<br>
selectively in communication and interacts with the one or more wireless devices across<br>
the wireless network, such interaction typically occurring upon request of the end-user<br>
of the wireless device through the wireless network to download or interact with the<br>
server. The end-user interaction with at least one server across the wireless network<br>
causes a subscription of an appUcation or service, which can be recorded and billed for<br>
at Ihe same server or through the interaction of several computer devices on the wireless<br>
network.<br>
[0008]	The method for managing subscription price plans for applications and services<br>
provided to wireless devices from computer devices on a wireless network particularly<br>
includes the steps of causing a subscription of an application and service to occur from<br>
end-user interaction between the wireless device and a server, and recording the<br>
subscriptions for the wireless devices at the server. The method can also include the<br>
steps of billing the wireless device carrier service subscriber and tracking subscription<br>
deletion at the wireless device to automatically discontinue the subscription.<br>
[0009]	The present system and method thus enable wireless telecommunications<br>
carriers to offer value-added services from individual developers providing applications<br>
and services to wireless service subscribers without needing to build up a requisite<br>
infrastructure for providing the application and services. The system can provide<br>
further support by generating invoices to the carrier themselves, carrier subscribers, and<br>
can disburse payments for the subscriptions to the appUcations and service providers,<br>
however, in one embodiment, the system simply forwards the subscription records to<br>
the carrier for billing and collection. The user of the system can Ihus tailor the degree of<br>
control and responsibility of the billing server(s) in supporting third party applications<br>
and services to the wireless devices.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022]	hi this description, the terms "communication device," "wireless device," "hand<br>
held telephone," and "handset" are used interchangeably, the terms "server" and "end-<br>
to-end billing system" are used interchangeably, and the term "application" as used<br>
herein is intended to encompass executable and non-executable software files, raw data,<br>
aggregated data, patches, and other code segments. A "wureless device service<br>
subscriber" is a carrier service customer that pays a carrier for network airtime, i.e.<br>
voice and data calls fi-om the wireless device. And an "application or service<br>
subscription" is a value-added service or appHcation purchased by the vdreless device<br>
end-user firom another computer device on the network, such as an apphcation<br>
download server, which is typically billed periodically, e.g. monthly. A "value-added"<br><br>
subscriber" is a party who subscribes to a value-added service and does not have to<br>
initiate an automatic subscription when accessing the subscribed value-added service.<br>
Thus, in some instances, the purchasing end-user may not be the same person as<br>
wireless device subscriber, an example being a child end-user using the wireless device<br>
of the parent who is actually the wireless device service subscriber. Further, like<br>
numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views. With the advent of 3"*<br>
generation (3G) wireless communication technology, more bandwidth becomes<br>
available for wireless communications, and handsets and wireless telecommunication<br>
devices, such as cellular telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) with<br>
increasing capabilities have become available. Now, users can check weather, receive<br>
e-mails, receive paging messages, traverse the Intemet, and play an interactive game<br>
with a remote party all through his wireless handset, in addition to using it for<br>
maintaining audio communications with another party. At the same time, proliferation<br>
of computer technology has made easier and cheaper to develop digital media and<br>
deliver it to the wireless devices. The provision of more value added services, such as<br>
downloadable apphcations, can bring revenue to a wireless service provider or carrier,<br>
and one manner to achieve the additional revenue is to provide support to independent<br>
^plication developers. The present invention thus provides the billing support for third<br>
party independent appUcation providers who provide apphcations to end-users of a<br>
network carrier as is further described herein.<br>
[0023]	Fig. 1 depicts a communication network 100 used according to the present<br>
invention. The communication network 100 includes a wireless communications<br>
network, a public sAvitched telephone network (PSTN) 110, and the Intemet 120. The<br>
wireless communication network includes one or more communication towers 102, each<br>
connected to a base station (BS) 104 and serving users with communication devices 106.<br>
The communication devices 106 can be cellular telephones, pagers, personal digital<br>
assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, or other hand-held, stationary, or portable<br>
communication device that uses a wireless and cellular telecommimication network.<br>
The commands and data input by each user are transmitted as digital data to a<br>
communication tower 102. The communication between a user using a communication<br>
device 106 and the communication tower 102 can be based on different technologies,<br>
such code division multiplexed access (CDMA), time division multiplexed access<br>
(TDMA), frequency division multiplexed access (FDMA), global system for mobile<br><br>
communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless<br>
communications network or a data communications network. The data from each user<br>
is sent from the communication tower 102 to a base station (BS) 104, and forwarded to<br>
a mobile switching center (MSC) 108, wliich may be connected to a pubUc switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN) 110.<br>
[0024]	The PSTN  110  is  connected to the  Internet  120  and to the wireless<br>
communication network through a MSC 108. The PSTN 110 supports users accessing<br>
the Intemet using a computer 116 through dial up services. The user utilizes tlie<br>
computer 116 and dials through a telephone line 118 to access an Intemet service<br>
provider (ISP) 122. The ISP 122 provides connection between the user at the computer<br>
116 and the Intemet 120. Users at computers 114 may also access directly the ISP 122<br>
through high-speed data connections such as digital subscriber line (DSL), Tl<br>
connections, and the Uke. The Intemet 120 is a high-speed data network. A user may<br>
access the Intemet directly by connecting to a hub on the Intemet 120 or access through<br>
an ISP 122 connected to the Intemet 120. A billing server 112 may be connected to the<br>
Intemet 120, to the MSC 108, or to the PSTN 110. Preferably, the billing server 112 is<br>
connected directly to the MSC 108. However, the server 112 does not necessarily need<br>
access to the wireless device 106 but can solely reside on the network and a file level<br>
interface from the server can collect and transform the device download event into a<br>
billable usage record.<br>
[0025]	Fig. 2 is an interface architecture 200 that depicts data flow in a virtual<br>
marketplace available for access by the wireless devices 106 that causes an automatic<br>
subscription for applications and services accessed by the wireless devices 106. The<br>
automatic subscription system of the present apphcation may be a subsystem of the<br>
virtual marketplace 206 according to one embodiment, and it may also be an<br>
independent system providing the billing services to the virtual marketplace according<br>
to another embodiment. The independent developers 202, who generally have access to<br>
a computer 114 or 116, can submit their products through an interface 204, also known<br>
as the developer extranet, to the virtual marketplace 206, which can reside on a billmg<br>
server, an application download server, or any computer device on the wireless network.<br>
Thus one server can provide the entire virtual marketplace with full billing and<br>
collection of proceeds as is ftirther defined herein, or billing can be a separate system<br>
from the virtual marketplace with an interface to the marketplace to create the rated<br><br>
billing records and to process subscription billing services. The developers 202 may<br>
also submit their products through the developer extranet 204, which then forwards to<br>
the virtual marketplace 206, or the developers can submit the product directly to the<br>
virtual marketplace 206 If the developer is the carrier then the application is submitted<br>
through the carrier extranet 208. The interface 204 may be a web site in communication<br>
with the server or a file transfer protocol (FTP) conforming port on the server 112, or<br>
other data interconnection. The carrier extranet 208 may be an interface to the carrier's<br>
private network. It should be noted.that the developer extranet 204 and carrier extranet<br>
208 typically interface to a common server 112 or database that enables the virtual<br>
marketplace 206. If the developer extranet and carrier extranet cannot be hosted on<br>
private networks to enable interaction between the two without some common<br>
connectivity, the negotiation can occur through both extranets interfacing over the<br>
Internet to the server 112 or common database.<br>
[0026]	In one embodiment, before a developer 202 is allowed to submit his product,<br>
such as a software application, to the virtual marketplace 206, the developer 202 must<br>
certify that the product conforms to the standards established by the virtual marketplace<br>
206. The virtual marketplace 206 publishes a set of standards for its environment that<br>
should be followed by developers who wish to submit their products to the virtual<br>
marketplace 206. Standardizing the products ensures the product can run vsnithout<br>
problems on a user handset that supports the virtual marketplace's environment. One<br>
example of such environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW™)<br>
and BREW Distributed System (BDS) developed by Qualcomm Corporation. The<br>
product may also be required to be tested for conformance by a third party testing<br>
organization.<br>
[0027]	After the developer 202 submits the product, the developer extranet enables<br>
negotiation of the price for the product between the developer 202 and carrier. The<br>
negotiation may be conducted directly between the carrier(s), other third parties, and the<br>
developers 202 within the virtual marketplace 206 using the developer extranet (204), or<br>
through the carrier (212) using the carrier extranet 208. Thus, developers 202 can<br>
negotiate with other developers, and carriers, to deliver applications and services to<br>
carrier customers. After the negotiation, the virtual marketplace 206 retains an agreed to<br>
appUcation price plan between developer 202 and carrier 212. The product can be<br>
associated with the originating developer before negotiation starts.<br><br>
[0028]	After the product is included in the product catalog and made available to the<br>
users 210 of communication devices 106. An end-user 210 of the wireless device<br>
accesses the wireless telecommunications services through the carrier 212 receives the<br>
product catalog from the carrier 212. The end-user 210 can view the product catalog<br>
and select a product from the product catalog. The step of "selection" can be aa<br>
application download, menu disqplay, data transfer, diagnosis tool, or any other computer<br>
interaction between the wireless device 106 and billing server 112 or other<br>
communication device.<br>
[0029]	The selection is sent from the user wireless device 106 to the carrier 212, which<br>
forwards to the server 112, which is this capacity acts as an application download server.<br>
The server 112 checks the selection and downloads the product to the wireless device.<br>
The application is dispatched to the end-user's wireless device 106 via the carrier 212.<br>
After receiving the application, the end-user 210 can activate it on that end-user's<br>
wireless device 106. For certain products, the server 112 needs not to dispatch the entire<br>
product to the user device 106, but only a user interface portion of the product. The<br>
user interface interacts with the end-user 210 througji the user wireless device 106 and<br>
sends information back to the server 112 where the application runs. Note that in<br>
another embodiment, the appUcation runs on the device or it accesses services/content<br>
from a third party server and does not nm on the server 112.<br>
[0030]	Fig. 3 illustrates an end-user process 300 at the wireless device 106. When the<br>
wireless device 106 is powered up and in communication with the carrier, the wireless<br>
devicel06 receives a catalog of products and services that are available to the user, as<br>
shown at step 302, and displays the catalog on the wireless device display screen, as<br>
shown at step 304. The products and services available to the user may include<br>
interactive games, personal appointment applications, and other utility programs. The<br>
user can select a product with an associated price from the catalog, and the selection is<br>
received by the wireless device 106, as shown at step 306. The wireless device 106<br>
sends the end-user selection and a download request to the carrier 212, as shown at step<br>
308, through a data channel, and the carrier 212 forwards the selection along with the<br>
user and application download information to the server 112. The handset 106 also<br>
sends user infomiation, which is normally minimal as carriers 212 are very sensitive to<br>
retaining the user specific information to the server 112 through the carrier 212, as<br>
shown at step 310. The server 112 retrieves the selected product aad dispatches to the<br><br>
user wireless device 106. When the end-user wireless device 106 receives the product,<br>
as shown at step 312, the end-user wireless device 106 activates the product for the end-<br>
user. It should be noted that in another embodiment, the download acknowledgement<br>
can be sent after step 312, as opposed to the time of application or service download.<br>
[0031]	Fig.  4 illustrates one embodiment of the virtual marketplace  automatic<br>
subscription process 400 executing on a server 112. The server 112 receives the end-<br>
user selection along with the download request and the user information from the carrier<br>
212 (or wireless device), as shown at step 402, along with the user information, and can<br>
check to see if the user is a value-added service subscriber, as shown at step 404, i.e. is<br>
a subscriber for the application download or interactive service. Although, it is not<br>
necessary to perform this check if the application or service subscription can be<br>
instigated anew by the wireless device end-user. The subscription can also be part of the<br>
download acknowledgement. For example, the download may be one time purchase of<br>
30 days of use of an application, or a monthly subscription, and the end-user can have<br>
the option of pay per use or monthly subscription. If a check is made the user is a<br>
monthly wireless service subscriber, then the server 112 records the request, as shown at<br>
step 406, and retrieves the product, as shown at step 408, After retrieving the product,<br>
the server 112 sends the product via the carrier data network to the wireless device 106,<br>
as shown at step 410.<br>
[0032]	If so embodied, if the user is not a monthly subscriber, then the server 112 can<br>
check the user information received to see whether the user is a authorized subscriber of<br>
a wireless carrier, which would occur at decision 412. Conversely, the server 112 could<br>
be contacted by a prepaid wireless device or other device not subscribed to a specific<br>
carrier's service, and in which case another method of payment can be arranged with the<br>
end-user. Alternately, at this point a user authorization check can be made from the<br>
server 112 to a carrier 212 authorization service to validate that the user is a an<br>
authorized carrier user for the service. The user may be a wireless service subscriber<br>
and not yet a value-added service subscriber, and this would be a pay per use situation.<br>
If the wireless device 106 is a wireless service subscriber, then the server 112 has that<br>
wireless subscriber's information and an account set up for him. The server 112 records<br>
the request, as shown in step 414, and generates a one-time billable event, as shown in<br>
step 416. The server 112 can also generate a monthly bilUng record, step 418, and<br>
sends the billing record to the carrier 212, step 420. It should be noted that steps 414,<br><br>
416, 418, 420 may not occur until after 410 as a billable event is not logged or account<br>
created at 422 a successfiil download is confirmed was successfixl. Alternately, the<br>
server 112 can send data to cause another device on the network to create a billing<br>
record for downloaded applications. For pay per use value-added subscribers, a billing<br>
record is generated for each appUcation download or other subscription event. After the<br>
billing process is taken care of (pre-pay only), the server 112 proceeds to retrieve the<br>
product, step 408, and sends it to the user, step 410. For post pay events, the download<br>
proceeds and the download event is recorded and billing is handled after the end-user<br>
has the appUcation on the device.<br>
[0033]	In another embodiment, the system also handles the situation when the user is<br>
using a pre-paid wireless telephone, i.e., the user is not a monthly wireless service<br>
subscriber. The wireless telephone device can be a pre-paid device, where the user can<br>
purchase in advance for wireless communications services. Further, an application<br>
download server can make a call to a carrier provided pre-pay service first to authorize<br>
the apphcation download and secondly to debit the customer account. Pre-pay<br>
consumers are then not able to download subscription based apphcations. The amount<br>
of services purchased may be stored in the wireless device itself or in a card that can be<br>
inserted into the wireless device. This amount is debited each time the user makes a<br>
wireless call. When the amount is depleted, the wireless device can no longer place a<br>
wireless call, unless the user replenishes it at a dealer or purchases a new pre-paid card.<br>
[0034]	When a wireless device subscriber that has no existing subscription account<br>
selects a product for download, the server 112 can automatically create an account for<br>
this user, as shown in step 422, and then proceed similarly as if the user were a monthly<br>
subscriber. Such step is uimecessary if only usage records exist on the server 112. If so<br>
embodied, a billing record is generated, as shown at step 418, and sent to the carrier, as<br>
shown at step 420, before the product is retrieved, as shown at step 408, and sent to the<br>
user, as shown at step 410. The carrier 212 may deduct the amount from the billing<br>
record for the product from the user's pre-paid amount.<br>
[0035]	When recording the request as shown in step 406 or step 414, the server 112 can<br>
extract demographic information from the user information and record it along with the<br>
product information. One method of obtaining demographic information is using the<br>
Subscriber ID (SID) to derive detailed information about their customers and buying<br>
trends. The demographic information may be made available to the product's developer,<br><br>
so the developer may have an idea about the user of his product. The demographic<br>
information may also be provided to the carriers and allowing the carriers to have a<br>
better picture about the users who tend to subscribe to similar products or services.<br>
[0036]	Fig. 5 illustrates an end-user process for terminating an active subscription of a<br>
product by using the deletion process 500. The end-user can select a product jfrom the<br>
displayed active apphcations displayed on the wireless device 106, as shown in step 502.<br>
The wireless device 106 can display more than one catalog: one for all the products and<br>
one for the products targeted to the individual or groups that the user is associated with.<br>
The wireless device 106 receives the selection, as shown at step 504, and sends the<br>
deletion request along with the product and user information to the server 112, as shown<br>
at step 506. Alternately, if the application is solely resident on the wireless device 106,<br>
the user does not have to browse the catalog to delete the appUcation and unsubscribe.<br>
The user can utilize an application manager to delete the application on the device, and<br>
the delete event is queued and sent to the server 112 on the next data call.<br>
[0037]	Fig. 6 illustrates a server process 600 for a user terminating a subscription on a<br>
product for a specific value-added subscriber. When the server 112, either an<br>
application download server or transaction server, receives the deletion request and<br>
related information, step 602, the server 112 retrieves the user record, such as SID<br>
information, as shown at stqp 604, and updates the user record by removing the product<br>
from the Hst of active subscription products, as shown at step 606. The request can be<br>
simple deletion of a resident appUcation for which the end-user has a subscription, and a<br>
flag or other notification means can be sent to the server 112 for notification of the<br>
deletion.<br>
[0038]	The system accordingly can support flexible subscription plans.   A user may<br>
subscribe to a flat price service plan, where the user pays a fixed price per month and<br>
the wireless device subscriber can access all products listed in the catalog. The end-user<br>
may also subscribe to an adjustable price service plan, where the monthly subscription<br>
fee dq)ends on how many products or what products the user has subscribed to. The<br>
user may also purchase an application based on a one-time flat fee for a specified<br>
number of uses service plan. The system will automatically account for the subscription<br>
in whatever method provided.<br>
[0039]	Fig. 7 illustirates the monthly invoice process 700, which can be a process on a<br>
carrier 212 server. If so embodied, the server 112 can periodically generate invoices or<br><br>
other billing information for its monthly application and service subscribers every<br>
month and sends the invoices or other bilUng information to the carriers 212 of the<br>
wireless device service subscribers. The server 112 retrieves subscriber records, as<br>
shown at step 702, and then generates billing records for those wireless service<br>
subscribers as shown at step 704. Customer may utihze products which are subscription<br>
services or one-time purchase. Since the server 112 may support multiple carriers and<br>
users who are subscribers with different carriers, the billing records are segregated and<br>
sent to the carrier based on carrier specific tagged identifier, as shown at step 706.<br>
[0040]	Fig. 8 is a relationship map 800 illustrating the financial relationship between<br>
developers 202, the subscription billing system 802, carriers 212, and end-users at the<br>
wireless device 210. The subscription billing system 802 may support more than one<br>
carrier 212 and generate invoices separately for each carrier 212. The invoices<br>
generated are available for viewing by the developers 202. Each carrier 212 sends a bill<br>
to each individual user 210 who has subscribed or used a product or service from a<br>
product catalog, and receives a payment from each user 210. The carrier 212 pays the<br>
invoice to billing system 802, and the billing system 802 makes payments to the<br>
developers 202.<br>
[0041]	The relationship 800 shows the advantage of the present invention.    For<br>
developers 202, the present invention allows for easy marketing of their products and<br>
eliminates the hassle of dealing with individual buyers or the trouble of searching for<br>
publishers to carry their products. For carriers 212, the present invention provides a<br>
way to make more products available to end users 210, thus providing new venues to<br>
generate more profits, without the need to hire a large number of software developers.<br>
For users 210, the present invention makes more appUcations available to the users 210<br>
and maybe be eliminates the need for the users 210 to carry multiple electronic devices,<br>
such as pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or even game devices.<br>
[0042]	Fig. 9 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a billing record 900. The bilUng<br>
record 900 is kept in a billing database in the server 112 and has user identification 902,<br>
carrier identification 904, subscription plan identification 906an invoice 908 (which can<br>
include rated price information, developer fee, and Ust price information) and usage<br>
information 910. The billing record is generated by the billing server 112 and sent to<br>
each carrier 212. The carrier 212 then bills the user for the rated price. The carrier 212<br>
may adjust the invoice amount before billing the wireless device subscriber.<br><br>
[0043]	Fig. 10 illustrates a product record 1000 according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention. The product record 1000 is accessible to developers for viewing. It should<br>
be noted that sometimes only a subset of the billing record is accessible to the developer<br>
because there is carrier sensitive information in the billing record that is not available to<br>
the developer. The product record 1000 is kept in a product database in the billing<br>
server 112 and has a developer identification field 1002, a product identification field<br>
1004, a subscription usage (such as list price) information field 1006, a pay-per-use<br>
usage information field 1008, and one or more user information fields 1010. The<br>
subscription usage field 1006 can list how many value-added subscribers have<br>
subscribed this product on monthly basis; the pay-per-use usage field 1008 can list how<br>
many specific value-added subscriber have subscribed this product on pay-per-use basis;<br>
the user information field 1010 may list demographical data extracted firom the user<br>
information received. The usage record can also contain information such as subscriber<br>
id, timestamp, part number, part name, event type (i.e., download or delete), application<br>
list price, application developer fee, application license information, etc.<br>
[0044]	Fig. 11 illustrates one embodiment of the components of a billing server, such as<br>
can be implemented-on server 112. The server 112 has an invoice generator 1102, a<br>
subscription recorder 1104, a developer interface 1106, a controller 1108, a product<br>
database 1110, a catalog library 1112, a developer account manager 1114, a carrier<br>
interface 1116, and a billing database 1118. The invoice generator 1102 generates<br>
invoices to the carriers; the subscription recorder 1104 records user selections; the<br>
developer interface 1106 receives product submissions fi-om developers and provides<br>
access to the developer for viewing subscription information; the product database 1110<br>
stores all the products submitted; the catalog library 1112 stores all the catalogs devised<br>
for different carriers and hardware platforms; the developer account manager 1114<br>
provides subscription information or other data to the developers and makes payments<br>
to the developers; the carrier interface 1116 interfaces with the carriers; the billing<br>
database 1118 records billing records for all the users; and the controller 1108 oversees<br>
the operation of the server 112. In other embodiment, the application download server<br>
or transaction manager generates carrier invoices, and the carrier billing systems<br>
generate customer invoices. Consequently, the transaction manager manages active<br>
subscriptions and generates monthly subscription billing events that get exported to<br>
carrier billing systems and the transaction manager can supports billing services to<br>
/4<br><br>
developers 202 for developer payment reconciliation but this summary usage<br>
information does not include carrier sensitive usage information such as SID, etc.<br>
[0045]	A developer can access the server 112 through the interface 204, which is<br>
handled by the developer interface 1106, by entering his developer identification<br>
number. The server 112 assigns to each developer an identification number and a<br>
password. After entering the identification number and the password, the billing server<br>
112 allows the developer to access at least billing support services associated with the<br>
developer identification number.<br>
[0046]	It can thus be seen that the system yields a method for providing an end-to-end<br>
billing system 802 that supports multiple parties, where the subscription billing system<br>
802 supports plurality of developers and a multitude of end-users through various<br>
carriers. The system is transparent to the end-user that only sees the subscription-<br>
causing event and the subscription-ending event, with the system handling the billing<br>
between those events. The billing system 802 sets up individual accounts for each<br>
developer, where the products developed by each developer is hsted in his own account.<br>
The subscription billing system 802 also can associate each end-user with a carrier and<br>
records each end user's service plan. The system can also record product requests,<br>
deliver the product requested to the end-user, and generate invoices individually on per<br>
use basis or monthly on subscription basis. If so embodied, the payment collected from<br>
each carrier is recorded and an appropriate portion of the collected payment is<br>
distributed to the developers whose products have been used or subscribed by the end<br>
users.<br>
[0047]	In view of the method being executable on the computer platform of a<br>
computing device such as server 112, the present invention includes a program resident<br>
in a computer readable medium, where the program directs a server or other computing<br>
device having a computer platform to perform the steps of the method. The computer<br>
readable medium can be the memory of the server 112, or can be in a connective<br>
database. Further, the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media<br>
that is loadable onto a wireless device computer platform, such as a magnetic disk or<br>
tape, optical disk, hard disk, flash memory, or other storage media as is known in the art.<br>
[0048]	In the context of Figs. 3-7, the method may be implemented, for example, by<br>
operating portion(s) of the vdreless network to execute a sequence of machine-readable<br>
instructions, such the server 112. The instructions can reside in various types of signal-<br><br>
bearing or data storage primary, secondary, or tertiary media. The media may comprise,<br>
for example, RAM (not shown) accessible by, or residing within, the components of the<br>
wireless network. Whether contained in RAM, a diskette, or other secondary storage<br>
media, the instructions may be stored on a variety of machine-readable data storage<br>
media, such as DASD storage (e.g., a conventional "hard drive" or a RAID array),<br>
magnetic tape, electronic read-only memory (e.g., ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM), flash<br>
memory cards, an optical storage device (e.g. CD-ROM, WORM, DVD, digital optical<br>
tape), paper "punch" cards, or other suitable data storage media including digital and<br>
analog transmission media.<br>
[0049]	While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to<br>
a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and detail maybe made without departmg from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention as set for the in the following claims. Furthermore,<br>
