Amino alcohol derivatives or phosphonic acid derivatives and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing these<br>
[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to amino alcohol derivatives<br>
or phosphonic acid derivatives having excellent<br>
immunosuppressive activity, pharmacologically acceptable salts<br>
of amino alcohol derivatives or phosphonic acid derivatives,<br>
pharmacologically acceptable esters of amino alcohol<br>
derivatives or phosphonic acid derivatives, and to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as an<br>
active ingredient.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising, as active ingredients, one or more<br>
immunosuppressants and one or more compounds selected from the<br>
group consisting of amino alcohol derivatives or phosphonic<br>
acid derivatives having excellent immunosuppressive activity,<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, and<br>
pharmacologically acceptable esters thereof. Said compositions<br>
are useful as preventive or therapeutic agents for autoimmune<br>
diseases such as rejection of transplanted tissues or cells,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, or other immune activity-related<br>
autoimmune diseases.<br>
[Background of the Invention]<br>
In the past, anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids<br>
have been used for inflammatory reactions arising from<br>
abnormal immune response in treatment of immune-related<br>
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune<br>
diseases. These are, however, a symptomatic therapy, but not a<br>
fundamental remedy.<br>
Furthermore, it has been reported that immune system<br>
abnormalities are also involved in the development of diabetes<br>
and nephritis, but agents that improve these abnormalities<br>
have not yet been developed.<br>
On the other hand, it is critical to develop an approach<br>
to suppress the immune response for avoiding rejection in<br>
transplanted tissues or cells, as well as for treating and<br>
preventing various autoimmune diseases.<br>
However, immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporin A (CsA)<br>
and tacrolimus (TRL) that have been known in the past, are<br>
known to show toxicity against the kidney and liver. Although<br>
treatments that also use steroids are commonly used for the<br>
relief of such adverse reactions, it is presently the case<br>
that such agents have not necessarily led to producing a<br>
satisfactory immunosuppressive effect without showing any<br>
adverse reaction.<br>
In light of this background, it has been attempted to find<br>
excellent compounds with immunosuppressive effects that are<br>
less toxic.<br>
As to immunosuppressants, the following compounds are<br>
known.<br>
(1) Compounds having the general formula (a) disclosed in WO<br>
94/08943 (page 371)<br>
(in the above compounds (a),<br>
Rx represents a straight or branched carbon chain which may<br>
optionally be substituted with one or more substituents [said<br>
chain may contain a double bond, a triple bond, an oxygen atom,<br>
a sulfur atom, a group of formula -N (Rx6) - (wherein Rx6<br>
represents a hydrogen atom), an arylene group which may<br>
optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, or a<br>
heteroarylene group which may optionally be substituted with<br>
one or more substituents, and may contain, at the end of said<br>
chain, an aryl group which may optionally be substituted with<br>
one or more substituents, a cycloalkyl group which may<br>
optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, or an<br>
aromatic heterocyclic group which may optionally be<br>
substituted with one or more substituents],and<br>
Rx2, Rx3, Rx4, and Rx5 are the same or different and each<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group] are known as<br>
immunosuppressants.<br>
The above compounds (a) of the prior art contain two<br>
oxymethyl groups (-CH2ORX4 and -CH2ORX5) as essential groups<br>
substituted on the same carbon atom. The compounds of the<br>
present invention, however, contain one -CH2OR3 group and one<br>
lower alkyl group as essential groups substituted on the same<br>
carbon atom and are different from the compounds (a) in these<br>
substituents.<br>
(2) Compounds having the general formula (b) disclosed in WO<br>
96/06068 (page 271)<br>
[in the above compounds (b),<br>
Ry1, Ry2, and Ry3 each represent a hydrogen atom or the like,<br>
W represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or the like, Zy<br>
represents a single bond or an alkylene group, Xy represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or an alkoxy group, and Yy represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, an alkyl, alkoxy, acyl, acyloxy, amino, acylamino group<br>
or the like] are known as immunosuppressants.<br>
The above compounds (b) contain a phenyl group as an<br>
essential group in the basic skeleton. The compounds of the<br>
present invention contain a heterocyclic group such as a furyl<br>
group, a pyrrolyl group, or a pyrrolyl group having a<br>
substituent on the nitrogen atom instead of the phenyl group<br>
of compounds (b) and are different from the compounds(b) .<br>
However, compounds having a similar chemical structure to<br>
compounds (I) of the present invention have heretofore not<br>
been disclosed concretely in that publication.<br>
(3) Compounds having the general formula (c) disclosed in WO<br>
98/45249<br>
[in the above compounds (c),<br>
Rz1, Rz2, Rz3, and Rz4 are the same or different and each<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group] are known as<br>
immunosuppressants.<br>
The above compounds (c) contain two oxymethyl groups (-<br>
CH2ORZ3 and -CH2ORZ4) as essential groups substituted on the same<br>
~carbon atom. The compounds of the present invention, however,<br>
contain one -CH2OR3 group and one lower alkyl group as<br>
essential groups substituted on the same carbon atom and are<br>
different from the compounds (c) in these substituents.<br>
In addition, above compounds (c) contain a phenyl group<br>
between the -(CH2)2- group and the -CO-(CH2)4 group as an<br>
essential group in the basic skeleton. The compounds of the<br>
present invention contain a heterocyclic group such as a furyl<br>
group, a pyrrolyl group, or a pyrrolyl group having a<br>
substituent on the nitrogen atom instead of the phenyl group<br>
of compound (c) and are different from the compounds (c).<br>
On the other hand, a compound having the general formula<br>
(II) of the present invention shown below wherein X represents<br>
a sulfur atom is disclosed in WO 02/06268 as a compound<br>
wherein the protecting group of the hydroxyl group is a<br>
residual group of an ester of phosphoric acid.<br>
Furthermore, as to combinations of immunosuppressants,<br>
combinations of immunosuppressants such as FTY-720 and<br>
cyclosporin A or FTY-720 and tacrolimus are disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) Number Hei 11-80026.<br>
In light of this background, it has been desired to find<br>
excellent compounds with immunosuppressive effects that are<br>
less toxic.<br>

Furthermore, the present inventors have studied eagerly<br>
pharmaceutical compositions having immunosuppressive activity<br>
and found that the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention comprising, as active ingredients, one or more<br>
immunosuppressants and one or more compounds of the present<br>
invention exhibit excellent immunosuppressive activity with<br>
low toxicity. The pharmaceutical compositions increase<br>
activity more than that of the individual immunosuppressants<br>
and decrease adverse reactions so that they are less than that<br>
of the individual immunosuppressants. As a result, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are<br>
useful as preventive or therapeutic agents for autoimmune<br>
diseases or other immunology-related diseases such as<br>
rejection caused by transplantation of various organs or skin,<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
polymyositis, fibrositis, skeletal muscle inflammation,<br>

alkyl group, or a lower alkyl group substituted with from 1 to<br>
3 aryl groups wherein the aryl group may optionally be<br>
substituted with one or more lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, nitro<br>
group(s), halogen atom(s), or cyano group (s), the removal of<br>
the protecting group can usually be accomplished by treatment<br>
with a base according to the same conditions as those<br>
indicated hereinbefore in the case that the protecting group<br>
of the hydroxyl group is an aliphatic acyl, aromatic acyl or<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group.<br>
When there are protecting groups of the amino, hydroxyl<br>
and/or carboxyl groups in the compounds indicated in the<br>
method A, the order of the removal reactions of the protecting<br>
groups of the amino, hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups can be<br>
arbitrarIIy selected and the removal reactions can be carried<br>
out in order of precedence.<br>

treatments, for example, neutralization of the reaction<br>
mixture, if necessary, or fIItration of the reaction mixture<br>
when insoluble material is present in the reaction mixture,<br>

acetate to the neutralized solution or the fIItrate, washing<br>
the resulting organic layer with water, separation of the<br>
organic layer containing the desired product, drying of the<br>

sodium sulfate or the like, and then evaporation of the<br>
organic solvent to give the desired product. The product thus<br>
obtained, if necessary, is further purified by conventional<br>
treatments, for example recrystallization or reprecipitation,<br>
or by conventional procedures in organic chemistry, for<br>
example, absorption column chromatography using a carrier such<br>

suitable pharmacologically acceptable excipient and/or dIIuent,<br>
such as tablets, capsules, granules, powders or syrups for<br>
oral administration, or injections or suppositories for<br>
parenteral administration.<br>
Preparations are prepared by conventionally known methods<br>
using additive agents such as excipients (for instance,<br>
organic excipients including sugar derivatives such as lactose,<br>
sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and sorbitol; starch derivatives<br>
such as corn starch, potato starch, a-starch, and dextrin;<br>
cellulose derivatives such as crystalline cellulose; gum<br>
arabic; dextran; pullulan; and inorganic excipients including<br>
sIIicate derivatives such as light anhydrous sIIicic acid,<br>
synthetic aluminum sIIicate, calcium sIIicate, and magnesium<br>
aluminometasIIicate; phosphates such as calcium<br>
hydrogenphosphate; carbonates such as calcium carbonate; and<br>
sulfates such as calcium sulfate), lubricants (for instance,<br>
stearic acid, metal salts of stearic acid such as calcium<br>
stearate and magnesium stearate; talc; colloidal sIIica; waxes<br>
such as veegum and spermaceti; boric acid; adipic acid;<br>
sulfates such as sodium sulfate; glycol; fumaric acid; sodium<br>
benzoate; DL-leucine; sodium fatty acid; laurylsulfates such<br>
as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium lauryl sulfate;<br>
sIIicates such as sIIicic anhydride and sIIicic hydrate; and<br>
the starch derivatives described above can be listed), binders<br>
(for instance, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, Macrogol,<br>
and simIIar excipients to those described above),<br>
disintegrants (for instance, cellulose derivatives such as<br>
low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
calcium carboxymethylcellulose, and internally crosslinked<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose; and chemically modified<br>
starch/cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylstarch,<br>
sodium carboxymethylstarch, and crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone), stabIIizers (for instance, para-oxy<br>
benzoates such as methylparaben and propylparaben; alcohols<br>
such as chlorobutanol, benzylalcohol, and phenylethylalcohol;<br>
benzalkonium chloride; phenols such as phenol and cresol;<br>
thimerosal; dehydroacetic acid; and sorbic acid), flavors (for<br>
instance, conventionally employed sweeteners, acidifiers, and<br>
flavors), dIIuents, and the like.<br>
The dosage varies depending on the symptoms, age, etc. of<br>
the patient. For example, in the case of oral administration,<br>
it is desirable to administer 0.05 mg (preferably 5 mg) as a<br>
lower limit and 2000 mg (preferably 40 mg) as an upper limit<br>
per one time for a human adult and one to six times per day<br>
depending on the symptoms of the patient.<br>
In the case of intravenous administration, it is desirable<br>
to administer 0.01 mg (preferably 1 mg) as a lower limit and<br>
100 mg (preferably 10 mg) as an upper limit per one time for a<br>
human adult and one to six times per day depending on the<br>
symptoms of the patient.<br>

successively water (0.4 ml) and lithium hydroxide monohydrate<br>
(43.6 mg, 1.04 mmol), and the resulting mixture was stirred at<br>
50°C for 4 hours. After cooling, water was added to the<br>

dichloromethane. The extract was washed with saturated aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate. After fIItration, the solvent was removed in vacuo,<br>
and the residue was purified by chromatography on a basic<br>
sIIica gel column (NH type) using a mixed solvent of<br>
dichloromethane and methanol (50 : 1) as the eluent to afford<br>
the reaction product (35.2 mg, yield: 99 %).<br>
Subsequently, to a solution of the reaction product thus<br>
obtained in methanol (2.0 ml) was added anhydrous oxalic acid<br>
(98% pure) (8.9 mg, 0.10 mmol), and the resulting mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. After stirring,<br>
the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo, and acetone was<br>
added to the residue. The crystals precipitated were collected<br>
by fIItration, washed with acetone and dried in vacuo to<br>

Determination of Inhibitory Activities of Compounds against<br>
Host versus Graft Reaction in Rats<br>
(1) Two strains of rats [Lewis rats (male, 6 weeks of age,<br>
Charles River Japan Inc.) and WKAH/Hkm rats (male, 7 weeks of<br>
age, Japan SLC Inc.) were used. Five rats/group were used.<br>
(2) Induction of HvGR<br><br><br>
Spleen cells were isolated from the spleens of WKAH/Hkm<br>
and Lewis rats and floated in RPMI1640 medium (Life<br>
Technologies Inc.) at a concentration of 1 x 108 cells/ml. 0.1<br>
ml of the medium containing the free-floating spleen cells of<br>
WKAH/Hkm rats or Lewis rats (1 x 107 of the spleen cells) was<br>
then intracutaneously injected into the bIIateral foot-pads of<br>
hindlimbs of Lewis rats.<br>
(3) Administration of the Compounds<br>
Compounds were suspended in 0.5% tragacanth solution. The<br>
suspended compounds were orally administered to rats in the<br>
drug-treated group (Lewis rats injected with spleen cells of<br>
WKAH/Hkm rats and treated with the compound) at a volume of 5<br>
ml/kg once daIIy for 4 successive days starting on the day of<br>
spleen cell injection. The tragacanth solution (0.5%) was<br>
orally administered, instead of the compound-suspended<br>
solution, to rats in the "same strain group" (Lewis rats<br>
injected with spleen cells of Lewis rats) and the control<br>
group (Lewis rats injected with spleen cells of WKAH/Hkm rats<br>
and not treated with the compound).<br>
(4) Determination of Inhibitory Activities of Compounds<br>
against HvGR<br>
Average weight of the popliteal lymph nodes of the same<br>
strain rats was subtracted from individual weights of the<br>
popliteal lymph nodes of individual rats ("HvGR-induced<br>
changes in weight of the popliteal lymph nodes"). The<br>
inhibitory activities of compounds were calculated from the<br>
"HvGR-induced changes in weights of the popliteal lymph nodes"<br>
of individual rats in the drug-treated group versus the<br>
average "HvGR-induced changes in weights of the popliteal<br>
lymph nodes" in the control group. The inhibitory activities<br>
of compounds were expressed as ID50 values (mg/kg) as<br>
calculated by least squares method based on the doses of<br>
compounds administered and inhibitory activities at these<br>
doses.<br>
From the present experiments, compounds of the present<br><br>

tragacanth solution.<br>
(3) Induction of Adjuvant Arthritis<br>
0.5 ml of adjuvant solution prepared as described in (1)<br>
was intracutaneously injected into the right foot-pad of rats<br>
(usually Lewis rats). Five rats/group were usually used.<br>
Adjuvant was not injected in one group of rats (normal group).<br>
(4) Administration of Compound<br>
Compounds prepared as described in (2) were orally<br>
administered to rats at a volume of 5 ml/kg once daIIy for 21<br>
successive days. 0.5% tragacanth solution was simIIarly<br>
administered to rats in one group injected adjuvant (control<br>
group) and a group not injected adjuvant.<br>
(5) Calculation of Inhibitory Activities of Compounds against<br>
Adjuvant Arthritis<br>
One day after the final drug administration, the foot<br>
volume of each rat was measured by an apparatus for<br>
determination of the volume. The average value in normal rats<br>
was subtracted from the individual values in the drug-treated<br>
and control groups. The difference was expressed as the<br>
swelling volume. Inhibitory rate of the compound was<br>
calculated from the ratio of the individual swelling volume of<br>
the rat treated with the compound to the average swelling<br>
volume in the control group.<br>
Inhibitory activities of compounds were expressed as ID50<br>
values (mg/kg) calculated by least squares method based on the<br>
doses of the compound and their inhibitory ratios.<br>
From the present experiments, compounds of the present<br>
invention exhibited excellent inhibitory activities.<br>
