[Name of Document] Specification [Title of the Invention]<br>
Frame Structure in Motorcycle [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a frame structure in a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As a conventional frame structure in a motorcycle there is known a frame structure wherein a pivot plate is attached to a rear portion of a main frame and a pivot shaft is attached to the pivot plate (see, for example, Patent Document 1) .<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3548173 [0003]<br>
In Figs. 2 and 5 of Patent Document 1 it is shown that a pivot plate 17 is attached to a rear portion of a main frame 13 which constitutes a body frame, a pivot shaft 20 is attached to the pivot plate 17, and a rear fork 21 which supports a rear wheel is attached to the pivot shaft 20 vertically swingably. [0004]<br><br>
The pivot plate 17 includes right and left flat plate portions 18 and a connecting plate portion 19 for connecting the flat plate portions 18 with each other. The pivot shaft 2 0 is mounted through the right and left flat plate portions 18. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0005]<br>
The right and left flat plate portions 18 of the pivot plate 17 are required to be wide enough to let the pivot shaft 2 0 pass therethrough and the longitudinal size thereof becomes large, thus resulting in an increase in size of the pivot plate 17.<br>
The pivot plate 17 undergoes a large load because it supports a rear wheel through a rear fork 21 and is therefore required to be further improved in rigidity. [0006]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the frame structure in a motorcycle and thereby reduce the size and improve the rigidity of a pivot plate. [Means for Solving the Problems] [0007]<br>
In a motorcycle including a main frame extending backward and obliquely downward from a head pipe, a rear<br><br>
frame connected to a rear portion of the main frame and extending backward and obliquely upward, and an engine unit supported by a lower portion of the mainframe, the invention defined in claim 1 is characterized in that a pivot pipe is mounted on a rear face of a pivot plate provided at a rear lower portion of the main frame and a rear fork is supported swingably by the pivot pipe.<br>
[0008]<br>
Since the pivot pipe is mounted on the rear face of the pivot plate, the width in the longitudinal direction of the pivot plate becomes shorter than in the conventional construction wherein a pivot pipe is extended through right and left pivot plates.  Besides, the pivot pipe can be supported by the whole of the rear face of the pivot plate, so that not only the pivot pipe can be supported firmly but also the rigidity of the pivot plate itself is improved.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention defined in claim 2 is characterized in that the pivot plate includes a pair of opposed flat plate portions and a connecting plate for connecting rear ends of the flat plate portions with each other and has a generally U-shaped cross-sectional shape having an open<br>
front portion, a cutout portion is formed in a rear face<br><br>
of the connecting plate, and the pivot pipe is fitted in<br>
the cutout portion.<br>
[0010]<br>
By fitting the pivot pipe in the cutout portion formed in the rear face of the connecting plate, the longitudinal size of the pivot plate with the pivot pipe attached thereto can be made smaller. Moreover, since the pivot pipe is fitted in the cutout portion, not only the connection between the pivot plate and the pivot pipe becomes strong, but also the rigidity of the pivot plate is improved. [0011]<br>
The invention defined in claim 3 is characterized in that a pair of connecting members for connecting the rear frame and the pivot plate with each other are disposed on both sides of the main frame, intermediate portions of the connecting members are connected to the main frame, and front ends of the connecting members are connected to at least the pivot pipe mounted on the rear face of the pivot plate. [0012]<br>
Since the pivot pipe is supported not only by the main frame but also by the connecting members connected to the main frame, the rigidity of the pivot portion<br><br>
including the pivot plate and the pivot pipe is further<br>
improved.<br>
[0013]<br>
The invention defined in claim 4 is characterized in that a muffler is supported by a lower rear face of the pivot plate.<br>
Since the lower rear face of the pivot plate lies at a position close to the center of the vehicle body and close to the muffler, the size of a muffler supporting stay becomes smaller. [0014]<br>
The invention defined in claim 5 is characterized in that pillion step brackets to support pillion steps for a passenger to rest his or her feet thereon are supported by both pivot pipe and rear frame.<br>
The pillion step brackets can be supported more firmly because they are supported by both pivot pipe and rear frame.<br>
[Effect of the Invention] [0015]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 1, since the pivot pipe is mounted on the rear face of the pivot plate and the rear fork is supported swingably by the pivot pipe, the width in the longitudinal direction<br><br>
of the pivot plate can be shortened and the pivot plate can be made smaller in size. Moreover, since the pivot pipe can be supported by the whole of the rear face of the pivot plate, not only the pivot pipe can be supported firmly but also the rigidity of the pivot plate itself can be improved.<br>
[0016]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 2, the pivot plate includes a pair of opposed flat plate portions and a connecting plate for connecting rear ends of the flat plate portions with each other and has a generally U-shaped cross-sectional shape having an open front portions, a cutout portion is formed in a rear face of the connecting plate, and the pivot pipe is fitted in the cutout portion.  Consequently, the longitudinal size of the pivot plate with the pivot pipe attached thereto can be reduced and it is possible to reduce the size of the pivot portion including the pivot plate and the pivot pipe.<br>
[0017]<br>
Further, by the fitting of the pivot pipe into the cutout portion, the connection between the pivot plate and the pivot pipe becomes stronger and the rigidity of the pivot plate can be improved.<br><br>
[0018]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 3, a pair of connecting members for connecting the rear frame and the pivot plate with each other are disposed on both sides of the main frame, intermediate portions of the connecting members are connected to the main frame, and front ends of the connecting members are connected to at least the pivot pipe mounted on the rear face of the pivot plate. Thus, the pivot pipe is supported not only by the main frame but also by the connecting members connected to the main frame, whereby the rigidity of the pivot portion including the pivot plate and the pivot pipe can be further improved.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 4, since a muffler is supported by a lower rear face of the pivot plate, the lower rear face of the pivot plate and the muffler come close to each other and hence the size of the muffler supporting stay can be reduced.<br>
[0020]<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 5, since pillion step brackets are supported by both pivot pipe and rear frame, the pillion step can be supported more positively.<br><br>

of a window portion 13h formed in an intermediate portion of the connecting plate 13F and arcuate rear cutout portions 13j and 13k formed in rear portions of the left and right flat plate portions 13D, 13E. Numerals 13m and 13n denote upper and lower sides, respectively, of the window portion 13h.<br>
[0049]<br>
For fitting the pivot pipe 114 (see (a) of Fig. 5) into the cutout portion 13b, one end of the pivot pipe 114 is, for example, inserted into one rear cutout portion 13j, then is moved along the upper side 13m and lower side 13n of the window portion 13h, and is projected from the other rear cutout portion 13k. Alternatively, the outer periphery surface of the intermediate portion of the pivot pipe 114 is inserted into the window potion 13h and is moved to inner positions of the rear cutout portions 13j and 13k. Thereafter, the pivot pipe 114 is fixed to the pivot plate 13 by welding.<br>
[0050]<br>
Since the welding between the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114 is performed through the upper and lower sides 13m, 13n of the window portion 13h, the rear cutout portions 13j, 13k and the outer periphery surface<br><br>
114a (see (a) of Fig. 5) of the pivot pipe 114, the welding length can be made large and the connection between the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114 can be made strong. Thus, a strong connection can be ensured.<br>
[0051]<br>
Turning back to Fig. 4, according to the pivot plate supporting structure for supporting the pivot plate 13, the pivot plate 13 is secured to the lower rear end portion of the main frame 12, the pivot pipe 114 is secured to the rear face 13a of the pivot plate 13, one ends of the sub-frames 34, 34 are secured to the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114,  the opposite ends of the sub-frames 34, 34 are secured to the rear frames 21 and 22, and intermediate portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 are secured to the rear end portion of the main frame 12. In side view, the main frame 12, pivot plate 13 and sub-frame 34 form a triangular shape, and likewise the main frame 12, rear frame 21, 22 (only this-side reference numeral 21 is shown) and sub-frame 34 form a generally-triangular shape. Thus, a truss structure is adopted.<br>
Consequently, the rigidity of a pivot portion 165 including the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114 can be further improved.<br>
[0052]<br><br>
Fig. 6 is a view as seen in the direction of arrow 6 in Fig. 3. As shown in the same figure, intermediate portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 extending from the rear frames 21 and 22 side are secured to both side faces 12c, 12c of the main frame 12, and end portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 are secured to the rear face 13a of the pivot plate 13 and also to the outer periphery surface 114a of the pivot pipe 114.<br>
[0053]<br>
Thus, the pivot plate 13 attached to the main frame 12 and the pivot pipe 114 attached to the pivot plate 13 are supported also by the sub-frames 34, 34 attached to the main frame 12, so that it is possible to strongly support the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114 on which a large load is imposed from the rear fork 4 7 side<br>
(see Fig. 1).<br>
[0054]<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view taken on line 7-7 in Fig. 4.  Fig. 7 shows that a pipe rectangular in section is used as the main frame 12 and that side cover stays 16 7 and 168 for mounting side covers (not shown) are secured to the engine hangers 81, 81 mounted respectively to both side faces 12c, 12c of the main frame 12. Numerals 167a and 168a denote bolt insertion holes for<br><br>
insertion therethrough of engine mounting bolts.<br>
[0055]<br>
Fig. 8 is a side view of principal portions, showing a modification of the pivot plate related to the present invention. As to the same constructional portions as in Fig. 4, they are identified by the same reference numerals as in Fig. 4, and detailed explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
A pivot plate 171 secured to the rear lower portion of the main frame 12 is an integrally molded member of a pair of left and right flat plate portions 172, 172 (only this-side reference numeral 172 is shown) and a connecting plate 173 for connecting rear ends of the flat plate portions 172, 172 with each other.<br>
[0056]<br>
Each flat plate portion 172 is made up of an engine hanger portion 175 as a front portion, a pivot plate portion 176 as a rear portion, and a connecting portion 177 which provides a connection between the engine hanger portion 175 and the pivot plate portion 176.<br>
[0057]<br>
A cutout portion 181 is formed in the rear portion of the pivot plate 171 and the pivot pipe 114 is fitted and welded into the cutout portion 181.  Further, end<br><br>
portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 (only this-side one is shown) are welded to the rear face 13a of the connecting plate 173 and also to the outer periphery surface 114a of the pivot pipe 114.<br>
[0058]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 4, in the motorcycle 10 including the main frame 12 extending backward and obliquely downward from the head pipe 11, the rear frames 21 and 22 connected to the rear portion of the main frame 12 and extending backward and obliquely upward, and the engine unit 18 supported by the lower portion of the main frame 12, the present invention is firstly characterized in that the pivot pipe 114 is provided on the rear face 13a of the pivot plate 13 which is secured to the rear lower portion of the main frame 12 and that the rear fork 47 is supported swingably by the pivot pipe 114.<br>
[0059]<br>
According to this construction, the width in the longitudinal direction of the pivot plate 13 can be shortened and the size of the pivot plate 13 can be reduced, whereby it is possible to attain the reduction of both weight and cost. Moreover, the pivot pipe 114 can be supported by the whole of the rear face 13a of the pivot plate 13, so that not only the pivot pipe 114 can<br><br>
be supported firmly but also the rigidity of the pivot plate 13 can be improved.<br>
[0060]<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the present invention is secondly characterized in that the pivot plate 13 includes a pair of opposed flat plate portions 13D and 13F and the connecting plate 13F which connects the rear ends of the flat plate portions 13D and 13E with each other, the pivot plate 13 has a generally U-shaped cross-sectional shape, the cutout portion 13b is formed in the rear face 13a of the connecting plate 13F, and the pivot pipe 114 is fitted in the cutout portion 13b.<br>
[0061]<br>
According to this construction, the longitudinal size of the pivot plate 13 with the pivot pipe 114 attached thereto can be reduced and it is possible to reduce the size of the pivot portion 165 including the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114.<br>
[0062]<br>
Moreover, by fitting of the pivot pipe 114 into the cutout portion 13b, not only the connection between the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114 becomes strong, but also the rigidity of the pivot plate 13 can be improved.<br>
[0063]<br><br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, the present invention is thirdly characterized in that intermediate portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 as a pair of connecting members disposed on both sides of the main frame 12 to connect the rear frames 21, 22 and the pivot plate 13 with each other are connected to the main frame 12 and the front ends of the sub-frames 34, 34 are connected to at least the pivot pipe 114 provided on the rear face 13a of the pivot plate 13. [0064]<br>
Since the pivot pipe 114 is supported not only by the main frame 12 but also by the sub-frames 34, 34 connected to the main frame 12, the rigidity of the pivot portion 165 including the pivot plate 13 and the pivot pipe 114 can be further improved. [0065]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the present invention is fourthly characterized in that the muffler 63 is supported by the rear face 13a of the lower portion of the pivot plate 13 through the stay 139.<br>
Since the muffler 63 is supported by the rear face 13a of the lower portion of the pivot plate 13, the rear face 13a and the muffler 63, more particularly, the upper muffler half 136, come close to each other, whereby the<br><br>
size of the stay 139 which supports the muffler 63 can be reduced and it is possible to attain the reduction of weight.<br>
[0066]<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the present invention is fifthly characterized in that the step supporting frames 41 and 42 as pillion step brackets for supporting the pillion steps 36 and 37 for a passenger to rest his or her feet thereon are supported by the pivot pipe 114 and the rear frames 21, 22.<br>
Since the step supporting frames 41 and 42 are supported by the pivot pipe 114 and the rear frames 21, 22, it is possible to support the pillion steps 36 and 37 in a more positive manner.<br>
[0067]<br>
Although in this embodiment end portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 are connected to the rear face 13a of the pivot plate 13 and also to the outer periphery surface 114a of the pivot pipe 114, as shown in Fig. 4, no limitation is made thereto.  End portions of the sub-frames 34, 34 may be connected to only the outer periphery surface 114a of the pivot pipe 114.<br>
