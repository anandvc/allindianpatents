METHOD OF OPERATING A CONVERTER<br>
The inventio* relates to a method of operating a converter wherein the converter is mounted in a support ring by means of support trunnions and a drive is cantilevered off the support tmnnions, the converter being therefore configured so as to tilt about its horizontal axis and the drive being rigidly connected with a base by means of a brace strut.<br>
In a converter, excess carbon is oxidized by introducing oxygen into the molten crude iron.  The crude Iron Is thereby converted to steel.<br>
OE 38 27 329 [US 5,003,835] shows a torque-resisting strut for drives, particularly converter tilt drives, riding on the shaft tmnnions, carrying the drive housing, and each flanged onto or screwed onto a step-down drive that engages with a pinion Into a large gear mounted on the shaft trunnion so as to rotate with it, this mecheuiisia consisting of strut rods attached symmetrically to the axis of rotation of the shaft trunnion to be driven to the drive housing by spherical bearings, the lower ends of the strut rods being respectively connected with pivots fixed on the floor and cozuiected with one another by a rod. To this end the strut rods have in two parts; the free ends of the strut rods that are spaced from the pivots being connected with springs that function with tension and pressure, and the springs of the spring elements can be prestressed to a predetermined value by mechanical means.<br>
WO 2003/023,072 [US 2005/0012253] shows a converter drive con^rising a gear rim connected with the pivot trunnion of a converter vessel, in engagement with at least one drive pinion of<br><br>
the converter drive, and at least one locking device that can be pivoted into or out of the gears of the gear rim, in the form of a locking arm mounted on a horizontal shaft and formed with gear teeth.  This converter drive is characterized in that the shaft of the locking arm is mounted in at least one bearing in the end position, and that the locking arms can be moved, with force fit, into the gear teeth of the gear rims by actuators, for example hydraulic cylinders, and can be moved out of engagement with the gear teeth and that the shaft of the locking arm is mounted in the housing of the converter drive at its shaft ends each with an eccentric bushing mounted to rotate freely in one another/ in such a manner that a mutually ideal engagement position of the two interacting toothed regions of the locking device and of the gear rim can be adjusted by independent rotation of these bushings.<br>
DE 26 54 907 [TJS 4,121,481] shows a device on a converter having a tilt drive that is suspended on a tilt trunnion of the converter, and a strut that rests resiliently on the base. To this end, the tilt drive can be fixed in place relative to the base during the blowing process by a positioner.<br>
EP 003 108 lUS 4,265,136] Shows a strut for a drive that is mounted to move about a pivot axis, particularly for a converter drive, where the drive housing is supported, relative to the base, on both sides of the pivot axis with an elastic support device.  In this connection, a cylinder to which con^ressed gas is applied is provided as the elastic support device; its position can be adjusted, relative to the base, by an adjustment device.<br>
DE 30 07 916 [US 4,467,666] shows a strut for a cantilevered drive, particularly for converter drives, the drive<br><br>
housing being mounted on its shaft trunnion that can be driven and carries a large gear, multiple step-dovm drives that drive the large gear being flanged onto the housing with their drive motors, in each instance, and first parallel levers spaced at e<iual intervals on opposite sides of the axis rotation shaft trunnion being fixed to it by way joints which levers are connected with two identical parallel that pivoted at a location least one coupler connects extends slant and is provided spring all having ball joints. this strut characterized in second run normal position has longitudinal segments each gap articulated onto connect levers.></iual>
A fixing member of an element of a kinematic chain, such as an element of a gear wheel translation, for example, is known from DE 600 04 714 [US6,299,829].  Such a fixing member is fixed to a base of a steel plant converter, for example.<br>
It is therefore known that the converters are tilted for en^tylng by a cantilevered drive,  in this connection, support of the turning moment is always done by a rigid brace strut, which is attached to a base on one end and on the drive on the other end. Converters having jets below the bath level are exxiosed to severe vibrations as the result of the moving steel bath during operation, i.e. when oxygen Is fed in.  This excitation takes place over a broad range in all directions, in other words also in the tilting direction.  In order to relieve the stress of very great surges on the drive, the large gear is engaged by a locking arm that ensures<br><br>
that the surges are no longer applied by the large gear and the pinions, but rather are taken up by the strut, directly by way of the drive housing,  in this connection, great forces act on the base of the casting platform and the brace strut, which leads to damage to the casting platform and other system parts.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method with which the above-described disadvantages are avoided.<br>
This task is acconq?llshed, according to the invention, in that in a method according to the preamble of claim 1, the strut connects the drive with the base only during the tilting process, and Is disconnected from the base or from the drive or from both of them during operation of the converter.<br>
Further embodiments of the component are evident from the related dependent claims.<br>
The decisive advantage of the method according to the invention lies in the fact that the converter vibrate freely during operation when the brace strut is uncoupled.  The anvHtude of the free vibrations will remain restricted. By permitting free rotational movement, the forces introduced during operation are no longer transmitted to the base, but rather converted to movement energy.  Stress on the base and the strut is relieved.<br>
In a further development, in place of the brace strut, a shock iLbsorber is enqployed in. The converter vibrations are thus damped.  The shock absorber that is coupled in is designed in such a manner that it limits the maximal aiia&gt;litudes of the converter during operation, but without achieving the effect of a rigid strut.<br><br>
An illustrated embodiment of the invention will be described in greater detail using a very schematic drawing.<br>
FXG. 1 shows, in a side view, a converter having a support trunnion in a support ring.<br>
The single figure shows on side view a converter 1 having support trunnions 2. The support trunnions 2 fixed on opposite sides of the converter 1 are seated in a support ring 3. In  this way, tilting of the converter 1 about its horizontal axis is made possible.<br>
A drive 4 for tilting the converter 1 is carried on an end of the support tnumion 2.  The drive 4 is connected by a tonjue-tranemitting brace strut 5 with a fixed base 6 in order to withstand the turning moment.  The base 6 is the casting platform, for example.  During a tilting, the strut 5 connects the drive 4 with the base 6 in order to support the turning moment.<br>
During operation of the converter X,   i.e. while oxygen is introduced into the converter, the brace strut 5 is uncoupled either from the drive 4 or from the base 6 or from both of them, and the converter 1 can vibrate freely.  Alternatively, a shock absorber can be installed parallel to the strut 5 during such operation, and the vibrations of the converter are damped by this shock absorber.<br><br>
