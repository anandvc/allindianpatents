INSULATING GLAZING UNIT, ESPECIALLY FOR AN OPENING LEAF<br>
OF A REFRIGERATED ENCLOSURE<br>
The invention relates to an insulating glazing unit<br>
intended for the opening leaf of a refrigerated<br>
enclosure in which cold or deep-frozen products are<br>
displayed, such as food or drinks, or any other product<br>
requiring to be kept cold, for example pharmaceutical<br>
products or even flowers. The insulating glazing unit<br>
consists of at least two glass substrates separated by<br>
a gas layer and provided on at least one of them with a<br>
low-E (low-emissivity) coating.<br>
When products preserved in a refrigerated enclosure<br>
have to remain visible, as is the case in many current<br>
commercial premises, the refrigerated enclosure is<br>
equipped with glazed parts that convert it into a<br>
refrigerated "display case", the usual name for which<br>
is "refrigerated sales cabinet". There are several<br>
alternative forms of these "display cases". Some of<br>
them are in the form of a cabinet, and then it is the<br>
door itself that is transparent, while others are in<br>
the form of chests, and it is the horizontal lid that<br>
is glazed in order to allow the contents to be seen.<br>
In these types of display cases, it is necessary for<br>
the merchandise to remain perfectly visible to<br>
customers so that they can preselect the merchandise<br>
without opening the "display case".<br>
However, one of the main problems encountered in these<br>
display cases is the formation of fogging on the<br>
external face of the opening leaf, on the side facing<br>
the shop or store. This is because this external face<br>
is cooled by the refrigerated environment lying on the<br>
opposite side, the internal face side in contact with<br>
the internal environment of the enclosure, while being<br>
in contact with the surrounding atmosphere of the shop<br>
or store, which has a higher humidity and is at a much<br><br>
higher temperature: when the temperature of this<br>
external surface is at a temperature below the dew<br>
point, fogging occurs. This makes it difficult to see<br>
the merchandise.<br>
Another major problem is also the formation of fogging,<br>
or even of frosting, on the internal face of the<br>
opening leaf when the display case is opened in order<br>
to take out the merchandise. This is because the<br>
surface of the inner glass substrate, which has to be<br>
at a very low temperature, indeed below 0Â°C, then comes<br>
into contact with the ambient atmosphere, which is of<br>
much higher humidity and at a much higher temperature.<br>
The temperature of the inner substrate is then below<br>
the temperature of the dew point, and this results in<br>
the phenomenon of condensation on the substrate, or<br>
even of frosting when the temperature of this substrate<br>
is negative. The presence of fogging or frosting makes<br>
it difficult to see the merchandise, and it is several<br>
minutes, or even tens of minutes, before the fogging or<br>
frosting completely disappears.<br>
To alleviate these drawbacks, insulating glazing units<br>
in the prior art have been designed to have greater<br>
thermal insulation, namely double-glazing or<br>
triple-glazing units provided with one or more low-E<br>
coatings, and the substrate of which, in contact with<br>
the inside of the enclosure, is heated.<br>
Also known, from patent application WO 03/008877, is a<br>
glazing unit of increased thermal insulation for a<br>
refrigerated enclosure which, according to said<br>
document, ensures that fogging disappears on the<br>
external face of the opening leaf, on the side facing<br>
the shop or store.<br>
This type of insulating glazing unit consists of a<br>
triple glazing unit comprising three glass substrates<br>
3 mm in thickness, spaced apart by gas layers of equal<br><br>
thickness, 8 or 13 mm, and consisting of air, argon or<br>
krypton, two low-E coatings being placed on faces ?. and<br>
5 of the glazing unit (counting from the outermost face<br>
of the glazing in the closed position on the<br>
enclosure).<br>
According to that document, the glazing unit has a heat<br>
transfer coefficient U not exceeding 0.02 BTU/hr.sq.ft.F<br>
or 1.11 W/m2.K. It will be recalled that ] W/m2.K<br>
corresponds to 0.18 BTU/hr.sq.ft.F.<br>
The improvement in heat transfer coefficient U ensures,<br>
with the opening leaf in the closed position, that the<br>
outer surface is relatively warm compared with the<br>
temperature that it has because of the cold environment<br>
existing on its opposite side. This outer surface, on<br>
the shop or store side, is thus at a temperature above<br>
the dew point, preventing the formation of fogging on<br>
this outer surface when the display case is closed, but<br>
requiring no heating element on the outer substrate.<br>
However, although the drawback of fogging on the shop<br>
or store side has been solved, the drawback of<br>
frosting, on the enclosure side, remains latent. This<br>
is because such a glazing unit requires a certain<br>
delay, even a few minutes, before the frosting on the<br>
inner surface of the glazing unit has disappeared.<br>
Furthermore, owing to the fact that the heat transfer<br>
coefficient U is higher, the outer surface of the<br>
internal substrate in contact with the refrigerated<br>
environment will be even colder, thereby encouraging<br>
even more frosting to form on the substrate when the<br>
display case is opened and requiring a longer time<br>
before it disappears.<br>
To solve this second drawback - to prevent or to<br>
rapidly eliminate the fogging or frosting that has<br>
formed on the internal face of the glazing unit in<br>
contact with the inside of the enclosure - it is also<br><br>
known to provide, as already mentioned, heating<br>
elements placed on this internal face of the glazing<br>
unit.<br>
However, the electricity consumed by such refrigerated<br>
display cases, especially owing to the heating elements<br>
deposited on the substrates, goes counter to energy<br>
saving - the very present preoccupation in durable<br>
development and environmental protection - and also<br>
represents higher costs for the stores.<br>
Moreover, the various functional layers used, including<br>
the low-E coatings, are known to degrade the light-<br>
transmission of the glazing units. To ensure that the<br>
merchandise is correctly visible from outside the<br>
enclosure, stores do not hesitate in fitting the inside<br>
of the enclosures with lighting which, apart from the<br>
additional energy expended, necessarily generates heat<br>
that may degrade the quality of the frozen products on<br>
display and the corresponding refrigerated unit will<br>
consume more energy.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide an<br>
optimum solution for an insulating glazing unit with an<br>
enhanced thermal property intended to be used for a<br>
refrigerated display case, which solution avoids the<br>
formation of fogging or frosting, even under difficult<br>
conditions as regards the external and internal<br>
environments of the display case, the frequency with<br>
which it is opened, for taking merchandise out of the<br>
display case or for restocking it, and which is<br>
efficient in terms of energy-saving and ensures that<br>
the products displayed in said display case are of high<br>
quality and can be easily seen.<br>
In the rest of the description, it is to be understood<br>
that "inner" and "outer" are terms referring to<br>
elements that are turned toward the inside and the<br>
outside, respectively, of the refrigerated enclosure<br><br>
when the opening leaf is in the closed position.<br>
"Internal" and "external" are understood to mean terms<br>
for elements that are turned toward the inside and the<br>
outside, respectively, of the insulating glazing unit.<br>
According to the invention, the insulating glazing unit<br>
intended in particular for an opening leaf of a<br>
refrigerated enclosure comprises at least two glass<br>
substrates, at least one spacer of low thermal<br>

units, such as face 1, correspond to the outer surface<br><br>
of the glazing unit in contact with the ambient<br>
atmosphere, whereas face 4, or alternatively face 6,<br>
corresponds to that surface in contact with the<br>
refrigerated enclosure.<br>
Preferably, an antireflection coating is deposited on<br>
at least one of the substrates, preferably on face 1<br>
and/or on face 3 and/or on face 5 of the glazing unit.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the<br>
insulating glazing unit is a triple glazing unit<br>
comprising three glass substrates, namely a first<br>
substrate, the external face of which is intended to be<br>
in contact with the inside of the enclosure with the<br>
opening leaf in its closed position, a second substrate<br>
or intermediate substrate, and a third substrate, the<br>

spacer of low thermal conductivity:<br>
-	the thickness of the substrates being between 2<br>
and 5 mm, preferably being equal to 3 or 4 mm;<br>

Advantageously, the low-E coating is deposited on that<br>
face of the glazing unit which is associated with the<br>
thicker gas layer.<br>
[Preferably, at least one antiref lection coating is<br>
deposited on one of the faces of the glazing unit,<br>
preferably on at least one of faces 1, 3 and 5.<br>
According to a variant of this embodiment, one of the<br>
gas layers has a thickness of 8 mm, whereas the other<br>
gas layer has a thickness of at least 10 mm, the gas<br>
layers being argon.<br>
According to another variant of this embodiment, one of<br>
the gas layers is krypton and has a thickness of 8 mm,<br>
whereas the other gas layer is air and has a thickness<br>
of at least 10 mm.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, the<br>
insulating glazing unit is a double glazing unit<br>
comprising two glass substrates, namely a first<br>
substrate, the external face of which is intended to be<br>
in contact with the inside of the enclosure when the<br>
opening leaf is in its closed position, and a second<br>
substrate, the external face of which is intended to be<br>

According to one feature, another low-E coating is<br>
deposited on face 3 of the glazing unit according to<br>
this second embodiment.<br>
Preferably, it has a thermal conductivity coefficient U<br>
of less than 1.05 W/m2.K with a gas filling of at least<br>
92%.<br>
According to a variant of this embodiment, the gas<br>
layer is krypton.<br>
According to another variant of this embodiment, the<br>
gas layer is xenon with a thickness of 8 mm.<br>
Advantageously, the double glazing unit includes, on<br>
face 1 and/or face 3, an antireflection coating and has<br>
a light transmission of more than 80% and an external<br>
light reflection of less than 10%.<br>
According to another feature of the insulating glazing<br>
unit of the invention, the anti-frost coating is such<br>
that, when the glazing unit provided with the<br>
anti-frost coating is brought into contact, on the side<br>
of the coating, with a temperature environment failing<br>
to at most -30Â°C, in particular -15Â°C, -18Â°C or -24Â°C,<br>
and then brought into contact with an atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of at least 0Â°, preferably between 10Â° and<br>
35Â°, especially between 15Â° and 30Â° and in particular<br>
between 23Â° and 27Â°C and having a residual humidity of<br><br>
at least 25%, no frost formed for at least 12 s,<br>
preferably at least 1 minute, in particular at least<br>
2 minutes, or even as long as at least 3 minutes.<br>
This anti-frost coating includes an antifreeze compound<br>
that lowers the crystallization temperature, such as a<br>
salt, especially KC1, NaCl or equivalent in solution,<br>
and/or an alcohol, and/or a suitable hydrophilic<br>
polymer, copolymer, prepolymer or oligomer, optionally<br>
in water, and optionally one or more surfactants, this<br>
compound optionally having a hydrophobic character on<br>
part of its surface.<br>
Advantageously, the antifreeze compound	is combined<br>
with at least one other compound so as	to obtain a<br>
physical or chemical interaction that mechanically<br>
reinforces the coating.<br>
This antifreeze is, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
this being combined with a polyurethane so as to create<br>
a physical interaction, or it may be a polyol, this<br>
being combined with at least one isocyanato functional<br>
group so as to create a chemical interaction.<br>
According to another feature of the insulating glazing<br>
unit, the spacer placed between the substrates<br>
comprises, in one embodiment, a first sealing barrier<br>
consisting of a body made of a thermoplastic, of the<br>
styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) or polypropylene type, said<br>
thermoplastic being blended with reinforcement fibers,<br>
of the glass type, and of a metal foil, of the aluminum<br>
or stainless steel type, which partly covers the<br>
thermoplastic, and also a second sealing barrier, which<br>
seals against liquids and vapor, of the polysulfide<br>
type.<br>
According to another embodiment of the spacer, this<br>
consists, over at least part of the periphery of the<br>
glazing unit, of a substantially flat strip that is<br><br>
fastened to the edges of the substrates and is made of<br>
stainless steel, aluminum or plastic reinforced with<br>
reinforcement fibers, and comprising, on that face on<br>
the opposite side from the gas layer, a metal coating<br>
constituting a barrier that seals against vapor, gases<br>
and liquids. In addition, the spacer has a linear<br>
buckling strength of at least 400 N/m.<br>
Preferably, at least the outer substrates of the<br>
insulating glazing unit of the invention are made of<br>
toughened glass.<br>
Such an insulating glazing unit characterized above is<br>
advantageously used as an opening leaf, in particular<br>
for a refrigerated enclosure.<br>
When the opening leaf includes, for supporting the<br>
glazing unit, a frame formed from aluminum and having a<br>
thermal bridge break, it advantageously has an overall<br>
heat transfer coefficient Uw of less than 1.25 W/m2.K<br>
for a gas filling of at least 92%.<br>
When the opening leaf includes a frame formed from PVC,<br>
it has an overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of less<br>
than 1.20 W/m2.K for a gas filling of 92%.<br>
The inventors have thus demonstrated the type of<br>
combinations of the various features of the glazing<br>
unit that have to be employed in order to provide the<br>
optimum solution as regards the thermal insulation and<br>
light transmission performance of the glazing unit, and<br>
to prevent the formation of fogging and frosting on the<br>
outer and inner faces of the glazing unit respectively,<br>
when it is used as an opening leaf in a refrigerated<br>
enclosure.<br>
The invention thus relates to the combination of a set<br>
of features of the glazing unit, these being, in<br>
particular, the thickness of the gas layer, the type of<br><br>
gas, the type of spacer, the types	of functional<br>
coating used and their position, the	heat transfer<br>
coefficient of the glazing unit and the	presence of an<br>
antifreeze layer.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will<br>
become apparent in the rest of the description with<br>
regard to the appended drawings, which are not drawn to<br>
scale, in which figures 1 and 2 illustrate,<br>
respectively, two partial sectional views of two<br>
embodiments of a glazing unit according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates, as a first embodiment of the<br>
invention, a gas-filled insulating triple glazing unit<br>
10	containing no heating element and having at least<br>
one low-E coating 30 and an anti-frost coating 40, and<br>
exhibiting a heat transfer coefficient U of less than<br>
1.2 W/m2.K, preferably less than 1.15 W/m2.K with a gas<br>
fill factor of at least 85%, and an externa] Light<br>
transmission factor of at least 67% combined with a<br>
light reflection of less than 18%.<br>
The triple glazing unit 10 comprises three glass<br>
substrates, namely a first substrate or inner substrate<br>
11	the external face 11a of which is intended to be in<br>
contact with the inside of the enclosure when the<br>
opening leaf is in the closed position, a second<br>
substrate or intermediate substrate 12, and a third<br>
substrate or outer substrate 13, the external face 13a<br>
of which is intended to be in contact with the<br>
environment external to the enclosure. The first and<br>
third substrates 11 and 13 are preferably made of<br>
toughened glass.<br>
The faces of the substrates are denoted by 1 to 6 and<br>
bear the references (1) to (6) in the figures - they<br>
correspond to the external face 13a, intended to be in<br>
contact with the environment external to the enclosure,<br><br>
as far as the face 11a intended to be in contact with<br>
the inside of the enclosure when the opening leaf is in<br>
the closed position, respectively.<br>
The thickness of each of the substrates is between 2<br>
and 5 mm, and it is preferably 3 or 4 mm so as to<br>
minimize the overall weight of the glazing unit and to<br>
optimize the light transmission.<br>
The substrates are separated from one another by a<br>
spacer 50 of low thermal conductivity, which spacer may<br>
consist of two separate elements or a single element<br>
astride the intermediate substrate.<br>
This spacer has a thermal conductivity coefficient of<br>
at most 1 W/m.K (or 1.88 BTU/hr.ft.F) , preferably less<br>
than 0.7 W/m.K and better still less than 0.4 W/m.K. It<br>
will be recalled that 1 BTU/hr.ft.F corresponds to<br>
0.534 W/m.K.<br>
One example of a spacer has a base body made of a<br>
thermoplastic, of the styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) or<br>
polypropylene type, and reinforcement fibers, of the<br>
glass type, which are blended with the thermoplastic,<br>
and also a metal foil providing a gas and water vapor<br>
seal, which is adhesively bonded to one part of the<br>
base body, said part being intended to lie on the<br>
opposite side from the internal airspace of the glazing<br>
unit. The base body, which also includes a dehydrating<br>
agent, is deposited around the periphery and in the<br>
separating space between the substrates. An additional<br>
barrier, sealing the spacer with respect to liquids and<br>
vapor, which is made for example of polysulfide,<br>
polyurethane or silicone, is placed on the same side of<br>
the spacer as the metal foil.<br>
Such a spacer, which is based on SAN and glass fibers,<br>
is known for example by the brand name SWISSPACERÂ®,<br>
from Saint-Gobain Glass, when the metal. foil of the<br><br>
base body is made of aluminum, and by the name<br>
SWISSPACER VÂ® when the metal foil of the base body is<br>
made of stainless steel, and which associates with a<br>
double polysulfide barrier, has a thermal conductivity<br>
coefficient of 0.64 W/m.K (or 1.20 BTU/hr.ft.F) in the<br>
case of SWISSPACERÂ® and 0.25 W/m.K (or<br>
0.47 BTU/hr.ft.F) in the case of SWISSPACER VÂ®.<br>
Mention may also be made, as type of spacer, of the<br>
spacer disclosed in application WO 01/79644, which<br>
consists of a substantially flat profile placed, not on<br>
the inside of the glazing unit but on the outside, and<br>
fastened to the edges of the substrates. This strip may<br>
be based on stainless steel or aluminum or on a plastic<br>
reinforced with reinforcement fibers, its linear<br>
buckling strength being at least 400 N/m. This type of<br>
spacer includes, at least on one of its faces, a<br>
sealing barrier that seals against gases, dust and<br>
liquids, formed by a metal coating or a coating of any<br>
other suitable material.<br>
The spacer is for example made entirely of a.lumlnum,<br>
with a thickness of 0.5 mm, and has a thermal<br>
conductivity coefficient of 0.25 W/m.K (or<br>
0.47 BTU/hr.ft.F) .<br>
The airspace between the inner substrate 11 and the<br>
intermediate substrate 12 is formed by an inner gas<br>
layer 14 and the airspace between the outer substrate<br>
13 and the intermediate substrate 12 consists of an<br>
outer gas layer 15, the thickness of the gas layers<br>
being at least 4 mm and tailored according to the<br>
desired performance in terms of the heat transfer<br>
coefficient U, without however being greater than<br>
16 mm.<br>
At least one of the gas layers consists of a rare gas,<br>
which is chosen from argon, krypton and xenon, with a<br>
fill factor of at least 85%. For an even better<br><br>
coefficient U, filling to at least 92% with krypton or<br>
xenon will be preferred.<br>
When the glazing unit has more than one gas layer, one<br>
of them may be air, and in this case the thickness of<br>
the air layer is at least 10 mm.<br>
The glazing unit includes a low-E coating 30 placed on<br>
at least part of the face 13b of the outer substrate 13<br>
facing the inside of the glazing unit (face 2) and/or<br>
another low-E coating 31 of the same type deposited on<br>
at least part of the face 12a of the intermediate<br>
substrate 12 facing the inner substrate 11 (face 4).<br>
The low-E coatings could also be provided on faces 2<br>
and 3. When the glazing unit is simply provided with a<br>
single coating it is preferably placed on that surface<br>
associated with the thickness of the thicker gas layer.<br>
The low-E coatings are based on layers of metal and<br>
metal oxides that can be obtained by various processes,<br>
namely by vacuum processes (thermal evaporation,<br>
magnetron cathode sputtering) or by pyrolytic<br>
deposition of organometallic compounds, in liquid,<br>
solid or gaseous form, that are propelled by a carrier<br>
gas onto the surface of the heated substrate.<br>
Preferably, the metal layers are based on silver and<br>
the metal oxide layers are based on zinc, tin,<br>
titanium, aluminum, nickel, chromium or antimony (Sb)<br>
compounds or nitride compounds or a mixture of at least<br>
two of these compounds, and optionally blocking layers,<br>
such as a blocker metal or a blocker metal alloy, of<br>
the Ti type, as upper layer of silver.<br>
As examples, mention may be made of the following<br>
multilayer coatings, for which the notation (TiO2)<br>
means that this is an optional element:<br>
glass/SnO2/(TiO2)/ZnO/Ag/Ti or NiCr or NiCrOx/ZnO/SnO2<br><br>
or Si3N4/SnZnOx:Sb or TiOx<br>
glass/SnO2/TiO2/ZnO/Ag/NiCrOx/(TiO2) /SnO2/SnZnOx: Sb.<br>
For further details, in particular as regards the<br>
various embodiments of these multilayer coatings,<br>
thicknesses and amounts of compounds, the reader may<br>
refer to patent applications FR 2 783 918 or<br>
EP 1 042 247.<br>
According to the invention, the type of coating allows<br>
a suitable compromise to be made between the optical<br>
quality of the substrate, in particular as regards its<br>
light transmission in the visible, and its reflection<br>
quality in the infrared.<br>
The low-E coating used in the glazing unit of the<br>
invention has an emissivity not exceeding 0.3,<br>
preferably not exceeding 0.05, and a light transmission<br>
of greater than 75%, preferably greater than 85%.<br>
Furthermore, the product PLANITHERMÂ® FUTUR N from<br>
Saint-Gobain Glass, which has, as glass 4 mm in<br>
thickness, an emissivity of 0.04 and a light<br>
transmission of 88.4%, may be used as substrate<br>
provided with such a coating.<br>
Another suitable product also according to the<br>
invention is PLANITHERMÂ® ULTRA from Saint-Gobain Glass<br>
which has, as glass 4 mm in thickness, an emissivity of<br>
0.02 and a light transmission of 86.7%. With such a<br>
product used for one or all of the substrates, the<br>
coefficient U may be even better in terms of insulation<br>
than with the product PLANITHERMÂ® FUTUR N but the<br>
glazing unit will lose out slightly in terms of light<br>
transmission.<br>
In addition, at least one antirefiection coating 32 may<br>
be provided on one or more substrates, preferably on<br>
face 1 and/or face 3 and/or face 5. This has the<br><br>
advantage, apart from its antireflection	function, of<br>
increasing the light transmission of the	glazing unit<br>
and of further improving the visibility of	the products<br>
in the display case.<br>
Finally, the glazing unit includes an anti-frost<br>
coating 40 on the external face 11a of the inner<br>
substrate 11. This coating may be a layer deposited<br>
directly on the substrate or deposited on a plastic<br>
film fastened to the substrate.<br>
In particular, this anti-frost coating prevents, when<br>
the glazing unit provided with the anti-frost coating<br>
is brought into contact, on that side of the coating,<br>
with a temperature environment falling to at most<br>
-30Â°C, in particular -15Â°C, -18Â°C or -24Â°C, and then<br>
into contact with an atmosphere at a temperature of at<br>
least 0Â°, preferably between 10Â° and 35Â°, especially<br>
15Â° and 30Â° and in particular 23Â° and 27Â°C and with at<br>
least 25% residual humidity, any frosting forming for<br>
at least 12 s, preferably at least 1 minute, in<br>
particular at least 2 minutes or even as long as at<br>
least 3 minutes.<br>
The value of 3 minutes, in accordance with the EN4 4.1<br>
standard, is given for the usual conditions of use in a<br>
store. It goes without saying that the coating also<br>
fulfills its anti-frost function for any time that the<br>
opening leaf is open, and irrespective of the frequency<br>
with which it is opened, for any time of less than<br>
3 minutes and as soon as the temperature on the coating<br>
side is at or below 0Â°C, whereas the temperature on the<br>
opposite side is above 0Â°C, and even accompanied by<br>
high humidity.<br>
The anti-frost coating is adsorbent and absorbent.<br>
It is adsorbent in the sense that the water molecules<br>
arriving on the surface of the substrate are attached<br><br>
to the surface and bond to the surface, allowing the<br>
coating to fully play its absorption function.<br>
The coating is absorbent (hydrophilic) since the water<br>
molecules penetrate into it, and are thus absorbed.<br>
The coating includes an antifreeze compound that lowers<br>
the crystallization temperature, such as a salt,<br>
especially KC1, NaCl or equivalent in solution and/or<br>
an alcohol and/or a suitable hydrophilic polymer,<br>
copolymer, prepolymer or oligomer, optionally in water,<br>
and optionally one or more surfactants, this compound<br>
optionally having a hydrophobic character on part of<br>
its surface.<br>
Thus, the antifreeze compound makes it possible for<br>
bonds to be created between said compound and the water<br>
molecules, preventing the latter from linking together<br>
and forming water crystals constituting the frost.<br>
As alcohols in the antifreeze compound, ethanol or<br>
isopropanol is especially employed.<br>
The hydrophilic polymers, copolymers, prepolymers or<br>
oligomers as constituents of the solution are in<br>
particular based on polyvinylpyrrolidone of the<br>
poly (n-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) or poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone)<br>
type, polyvinylpyrridine of tflG<br>
poly(n-vinyi-2-pyrridine) type, of the<br>
poly(n-vinyl-3-pyrridine) type or of the<br>
poly(n-vinyl-4-pyrridine) type, a polyacrylate of the<br>
poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) type, a polyacrylamide of<br>
the poly(N',N-hydroxyacrylamide) type, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyacrylonitrile, or of the polyol type, such<br>
as polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene. In particular,<br>
the copolymers are based on at least one of the<br>
constituent monomers of these polymers.<br><br>
The choice of hydrophilic polymer and of the porosity<br>
makes it possible in particular to regular the rate of<br>
water absorption and the water absorbtivity. The<br>
porosity of the layer is advantageously between 0.1 and<br>
100 cm3/g and preferably less than 20 cm3/g. The<br>
porosity defines the void volume of the pores per unit<br>
of weight of the layer.<br>
As surfactants, mention may be made of compounds<br>
comprising a lipophilic part Y, which may be an<br>
unsaturated, linear or branched, aliphatic chain or an<br>
aromatic or alkylaromatic chain, and an ionic or<br>
nonionic hydrophilic head.<br>
Examples of these are:<br>
anionic surfactants: Y-CO2"M+; Y-OSO3~M+; Y-SOV<br>
M ; dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl sulfonates;<br>
sulfonated fatty acids and fatty acid esters; alkyiaryi<br>
sulfonates;<br>
cationic surfactants: Y- (R) nNH+(4^n) /X~; Y-<br>
R4N , X ; alkyltrimethyl ammonium salts; alkylbenzyl-<br>
dimethyl ammonium salts; imidazolinium salts; amine<br>
salts;<br>
zwitterionic surfactants: Y-N+	CO";<br>
Y-N .....SO3~; betaines; sulf obetaines; imidazo'lium<br>
salts; and<br>
nonionic surfactants: Y-OR; Y-OH; Y-CO2R;<br>
Y-CONHR; Y-(CH2-CH2-O)n-; polyols; alcohols; acids;<br>
esters; polyethoxylated fatty alcohols.<br>
Furthermore, it iS desirable for the antifreeze<br>
function of the coating to be lasting, which may<br>
require improving the mechanical strength of the layer<br>
incorporating the antifreeze compound, in particular<br>
when said layer is likely to suffer occasion mechanical<br>
contact, or has to be cleaned. For this purpose, the<br>
antifreeze compound may be crosslinked and/or combined<br>
with at least one other compound so as to establish a<br>
physical interaction or a chemical interaction with it,<br><br>
and/or it may be dispersed in a solid matrix, for<br>
example an organic or mineral matrix or a mixed matrix<br>
of the ORMOCER (organically modified ceramic) type, or<br>
a sol-gel compound.<br>
The term "physical interaction" is understood here to<br>
mean a hydrogen bond, a polar interaction of the van<br>
der Waal's type or a hydrophobic interaction, these<br>
interactions being capable of providing mechanical<br>
reinforcement similar to crosslinking. Such physical<br>
interaction is for example achieved by mixing<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone as antifreeze compound with<br>
polyurethane as matrix compound for said antifreeze<br>
compound.<br>
Chemical interaction on the other hand results from<br>
blending the antifreeze compound with at least one<br>
other compound so as to create covalent bonds between<br>
them, the blend undergoing in a known manner a heat<br>
treatment for example, or a UV crosslinking step, a<br>
room-temperature crosslinking step, etc. It is thus<br>
possible to blend a polyol as antifreeze compound with<br>
another compound having isocyanate functional groups,<br>
and to heat this blend so as to obtain a polyurethane<br>
having the hydrophilicity functionality through the<br>
antifreeze compound and mechanical integrity through<br>
the chemical interaction between the hydroxy!<br>
functional groups of the polyol and tne isocyanate<br>
functional groups.<br>
For particular composition examples, the reader may<br>
refer to patent applications WO 00/71481 and<br>
FR 05/50271.<br>
In this first embodiment of the invention, several<br>
alternative forms may be envisaged depending on the<br>
desired level of the heat transfer coefficient U,<br>
together with a compromise between size and weight of<br>
the glazing unit and its optical properties.<br><br>
Table I below gives several embodiment examples A to E<br>
of triple glazing units that meet the desired<br>
performance requirements in terms of insulation and<br>
absence of fogging or frosting, without having to heat<br>
the glazing unit.<br>
Indicated in this table are the overall thickness of<br>
the glazing unit, the thicknesses of the glass<br>
substrates, the face or faces of the glazing unit that<br>
include the low-E coating, the thicknesses of the gas<br>
layers, the type of gas, the light transmission and the<br>
outer light reflection provided by such glazing units,<br>
the heat transfer coefficient U of the glazing unit,<br>
for example obtained relative to the chosen gas and to<br>
the gas fill factor (85% or 92%), and the overall heat<br>
transfer coefficient Uw of the opening leaf<br>
incorporating such a glazing unit.<br>
For each of these examples:<br>
the spacer 50 of low thermal conductivity<br>
consists of two separate elements for each of the two<br>
airspaces of the glazing unit, corresponding to the<br>
product SWISSPACER VÂ® from Saint-Gobain Glass described<br>
above;<br>
low-E coatings 30 and 31 are deposited on<br>
glass substrates corresponding to the products<br>
PLANITHERMÂ® FUTUR N from Saint-Gobain Class, with the<br>
exception of Example Al which corresponds to Example A<br>
for which one of the sub subrates is replaced with<br>
PLANITHERMÂ® ULTRA from Saint-Gobain Glass, the specific<br>
details of which were described above;<br>
the anti-frost coating 40 is deposited<br>
directly on the glass substrate, this being an<br>
EVERCLEARÂ® coating sold by Saint-Gobain Glass; and<br>
the antireflection coatings 32 are deposited<br>
on glass substrates, these coatings corresponding to<br>
the VISION-LITE plusÂ® products from Saint-Gobain Glass.<br><br>
The heat transfer coefficient U of the glazing unit was<br>
calculated at the center of the unit and according to<br>
the prEN 673 and prEN 410 standards. This calculation<br>
was also independent of the type of spacer.<br>
The overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of the opening<br>
leaf was calculated for the glazing units incorporated,<br>
respectively, in an aluminum frame with a thermal<br>
bridge break, a conventional frame for refrigerated<br>
enclosures and in a PVC frame. This calculation,<br>
according to the EN ISO 10077-2 standard, takes into<br>
account the dimensions of the opening leaf, of the<br>
glazing unit and of the frame, and also the type of<br>
spacer and the type of frame.<br>
The opening leaf was of 1800 mm x 800 mm format, the<br>
frame had a square section of 4 0 mm x 40 mm with a heat<br>
transfer coefficient U of 2.6 W/m2.K in the case of<br>
aluminum and 1.8 W/m2.K in the case of PVC. The glazing<br>
unit was fitted into a rebate over a width of 25 mm.<br><br><br><br>
These glazing units thus have a heat transfer<br>
coefficient U of less than 1.1 W/m2.K with a gas fill<br><br>
factor of at least 85%, and even less than 0.80 W/m2.K<br>
when argon is used with a thickness of 16 mm for one of<br>
the gas layers (Examples D and E) and preferably less<br>
than 0.65 W/m2.K with krypton for both gas layers and<br>
with a fill factor of at least 92% (Example B).<br>
The overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of the opening<br>
leaf into which such glazing units is incorporated does<br>
not exceed 1.25 W/m2.K with a gas fill factor of at<br>
least 92%.<br>
These glazing units thus make it possible to obtain a<br>
light transmission of at least 67% and an external<br>
light reflection of less than 18%. The figures given<br>
take account of the presence of the antifreeze layer,<br>
which lowers the light transmission factor by only<br>
about 0.5%.<br>
In the case of Example Al, as already explained above,<br>
the use of the PLANITHERMÂ® ULTRA iow-E glass substrate<br>
makes it possible, compared with Example A, to further<br>
increase the thermal insulation performance, although<br>
the glazing unit does however lose out slightly in<br>
terms of optical quality, the latter nevertheless<br>
remaining very acceptable.<br>
The use of an antiref lection layer, for example, on<br>
faces 1, 3 and 5 (Example E) results in an overall<br>
transmission of 79.8% with reduced light reflection,<br>
namely 7.2%, giving the glazing unit very comfortable<br>
optical properties.<br>
Example C, using Only a Single krypton layer, may be<br>
preferred to Example B when the cost of the glazing<br>
unit is of concern, since krypton is an expensive gas.<br>
Moreover, this Example C also demonstrates the<br>
situation that would occur if the gas from one of the<br>
two gas layers of Example B were to leak out;<br><br>
completely.<br>
Finally, it is estimated that over the course of time<br>
the loss of gas in a glazing unit is 1% per year (prEN<br>
1279-3) standard. Thus, after several years, a glazing<br>
unit would see its gas fill factor drop and<br>
consequently its thermal insulation performance would<br>
also drop. The row in the table indicating the<br>
coefficient U with a fill factor of 85% thus simulates<br>
the thermal performance of a glazing unit after 7 years<br>
when having been initially filled with 92% gas.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a second embodiment of the<br>
invention for which the opening leaf 1 comprises an<br>
insulating double glazing unit 20 filled with xenon<br>
and/or with krypton and/or with argon, with no heating<br>
element, but including at least one low-E coating 30<br>
and an anti-frost coating 40. This double glazing unit<br>
has a heat transfer coefficient U of less than<br>
1.2 W/m2.K, preferably less than 1.15 W/m2.K, and a<br>
light transmission of at least 75%.<br>
The double glazing unit 20 comprises two glass<br>
substrates 21 and 22 designed to be in contact with the<br>
environment of the refrigerated enclosure and with the<br>
external environment, respectively. They are spaced<br>
apart by a spacer 50 of low thermal conductivity, such<br>
as the one described in the first embodiment.<br>
The gas layer 23 between the two substrates has a<br>
thickness of between 4 and 16 mm, preferably at least<br>
8 mm.<br>
A low-E coating 30 is placed on at least one inner face<br>
of the glazing unit, i.e. on face 2 and/or on face 3.<br>
The coating is of the type of those described in the<br>
first embodiment, being based on silver and on metal<br>
oxides.<br><br>
The antifreeze coating 40 is deposited on the external<br>
face 21a of the inner substrate and corresponds to that<br>
described in the first; embodiment.<br>
An antiref lection coating 32 may be provided on at<br>
least one of the substrates, preferably on face 1<br>
and/or face 3 of the glazing unit.<br>
Table II below illustrates three examples F, G and H of<br>
the double glazing unit according to the invention. The<br>
heat transfer coefficient U was calculated at the<br>
center of the glazing unit according to the prEN 673<br>
and prEN 410 standards. This calculation was also<br>
independent of the spacer type.<br>
The low-E coating corresponded to PLANITHERMÂ® FUTUR N<br>
from Saint-Gobain Glass. The anti-frost coating<br>
corresponded to EVERCLEARÂ® from Saint-Gobain Glass and<br>
the antireflection coating corresponded to VISION-LITE<br>
PlusÂ® from Saint-Gobain Glass.<br>
Similarly to the first embodiment, the overall heat<br>
transfer coefficient Uw of the opening leaf in which<br>
these types of double glazing unit are incorporated was<br>
calculated as explained above with the same dimensions,<br>
the same type of spacer and the same type of frame.<br><br><br><br>
These glazing units designed for opening leaves<br>
requiring smaller dimensions, having a smaller total<br>
thickness, thus have a heat transfer coefficient U of<br>
less than 1.15 W/m2.K for a gas fill factor of 85% and<br>
less than 1.05 W/m2.K for a gas fill factor of at least<br>
92%. The opening leaves thus have an overall heat<br>
transfer coefficient Uw of less than 1.25 W/m2.K for a<br>
gas fill factor of at least 92% with an aluminum frame,<br>
and even less than 1.20 W/m2.K for a gas fill factor of<br>
at least 92% with a PVC frame.<br>
The .light transmission for Examples F and G is aL least<br>
78% and Very advantageously exceeds 81.5% when an<br>
anti-reflection coating is added, with a light<br>
reflection of 9.6% and 6.2t respectively.<br>
The glazing units according to the first and second<br>
embodiments of the invention meet Environment Classes<br>
2, 3, 4 and 5 given in the standard EN441 and repeated<br>
in Table III below, and in particular they meet Class 6<br>
when the heat transfer coefficient U is below 0.8, such<br>
as in the case of Examples B, D and E.<br><br><br><br>
