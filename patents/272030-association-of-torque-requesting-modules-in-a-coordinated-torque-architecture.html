				<td>ASSOCIATION OF TORQUE REQUESTING MODULES IN A<br>
COORDINATED TORQUE ARCHITECTURE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     This   application   claims   the   benefit   of   U.S.   Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/959,697, filed on July 16, 2007.  The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to coordinating torque requests<br>
between a plurality of torque requesting modules and a plurality of actuators that<br>
affect torque in a vehicle powertrain.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Powertrain control systems include a plurality of modules that<br>
require a certain amount of engine torque to operate properly. For example, an<br>
automatic transmission control module may need to momentarily reduce torque<br>
from the engine in order to change transmission gears. Another example may be<br>
C:\Documents     and     Settings\sss\Local     Settings/Temporary     Internet    Files\Content.lE5\F4TCJN9V\STEPHANIE<br><br>
an air conditioning clutch control module that needs engine torque to be<br>
increased a moment prior to engaging an air conditioning compressor clutch.<br>
The engine torque increase helps maintain a constant engine speed when the<br>
compressor clutch engages, particularly when the engine is idling.<br>
[0005] In the prior art these various modules affect torque actuators<br>
directly. For example, the automatic transmission control module may retard a<br>
spark advance to the engine to reduce the engine torque during the shift.<br>
Similarly, the air conditioning clutch control module may increase the spark<br>
advance to increase the engine torque during the moment prior to engaging the<br>
compressor clutch.<br>
[0006] As vehicle powertrain systems include more modules and more<br>
actuators that affect torque, the architecture of the prior art becomes<br>
cumbersome to maintain and undesirably difficult to troubleshoot. As an<br>
example of more actuators, hybrid vehicles include an engine and an electric<br>
motor that provide torque. Integrating the hybrid vehicle powertrain to existing<br>
torque-modifying modules can be undesirably cumbersome with the existing<br>
powertrain control architecture.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

axle torque request modules that generate respective axle torque requests based<br>
on respective performance criteria of a vehicle, an axle torque arbitration module<br>
that generates a net axle torque request based on the plurality of axle torque<br>
requests,   a  plurality  of propulsion  torque  request  modules  that  generate<br><br>
respective propulsion torque requests based on respective performance criteria<br>
of an engine of the vehicle, a propulsion torque arbitration module that<br>
determines a net engine torque request based on the net axle torque request and<br>
the plurality of propulsion torque requests, and a propulsion torque control<br>
module that controls a plurality of actuators based on the net engine torque<br>
request such that the engine produces an output torque in accordance with the<br>
net engine torque request.<br>
[0008] In other features an axle-to-propulsion torque conversion<br>

propulsion torque requests based on transmission gear shifts. The plurality of<br>
propulsion torque request modules includes an engine over-speed protection<br>
module that generates one of the propulsion torque requests based on a<br>
predetermined maximum engine RPM. The plurality of propulsion torque request<br>
modules includes an engine idle speed control that generates one of the<br>
propulsion torque requests based on a desired idle speed for the engine. The<br>
plurality of propulsion torque request modules include reserve torque request<br>
modules that generate respective ones of the propulsion torque requests based<br>
on torque that will be needed from the engine to compensate for an impending<br>
load change on the engine. The reserve torque request modules include an air<br>
conditioning compressor torque compensation module that generates a<br>
respective one of the propulsion torque requests based on torque that will be<br>
needed from the engine to compensate for an impending load change due to an<br><br>
air conditioning compressor clutch engaging and disengaging. The reserve<br>
torque request modules include a catalyst light off module that generates a<br>
respective one of the propulsion torque requests to change an exhaust gas<br>
temperature of the engine.<br>
[0010] In other features the vehicle is a gasoline/electric hybrid vehicle<br>
and the powertrain control system further comprises a hybrid control module that<br>
that determines how much torque of the net axle torque request is to be provided<br>
by an electric motor.<br>
[0011] A method of operating a powertrain control system for a vehicle<br>
includes generating axle torque requests based on respective performance<br>
criteria of a vehicle, generating a net axle torque request based on the axle<br>
torque requests, generating propulsion torque requests based on respective<br>
performance criteria of an engine of the vehicle, determining a net engine torque<br>

and controlling a plurality of actuators based on the net engine torque request<br>
such that an engine produces an output torque in accordance with the net engine<br>
torque request.<br>
[0012] In other features the method includes converting the net axle<br>
torque request to a propulsion torque request based on at least one of an axle<br>
gear ratio, a tire diameter, and a transmission gear ratio. One of the axle torque<br>
requests is based on a cruise control set speed of the vehicle. The method<br>
includes modifying the axle torque request based on an environment of the<br>
vehicle. One of the axle torque requests is based on wheel slip between a tire of<br><br>

requests is based on torque that will be needed from the engine to compensate<br>
for an impending load change on the engine due to an air conditioning<br>
compressor clutch engaging and disengaging. One of the propulsion torque<br>
requests is based on increasing an exhaust gas temperature to warm a catalyst<br>
to a catalyst light off temperature.<br>
[0014] In other features the method includes determining how much<br>

[0015] In still other features, the systems and methods described<br>
above are implemented by a computer program executed by one or more<br><br>
processors. The computer program can reside on a computer readable medium<br>
such as but not limited to memory, non-volatile data storage and/or other suitable<br>
tangible storage mediums.<br>
[0016] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0017]     The present disclosure will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0018]     FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a vehicle powertrain; and<br>
[0019]     FIGs. 2A and 2B are a functional block diagram of a coordinated<br>
torque control system for the vehicle powertrain.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br><br>
[0021] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0022] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram is shown of<br>
a vehicle powertrain 20. Powertrain 20 includes an internal combustion engine<br>
22 that develops torque. The amount of torque is established by one or more<br>
actuators 24 that control at least one of fuel, ignition, residual exhaust gas or<br>
exhaust recirculation (EGR), number of cylinders firing, and air flow, to engine 22<br>
in accordance with commands from a powertrain control module (PCM) 26. It<br>
should be appreciated that engine 22 may be a diesel engine, in which case<br>
ignition and air flow are not controlled by PCM 26; however, the fuel amount,<br>
injection timing, residual exhaust gas or EGR, and turbo boost could be<br>
controlled to control the amount of torque. For example, EGR and boost control<br>
the air flow indirectly by displacing air with exhaust gas in a cylinder charge. A<br>
crankshaft position sensor 28 generates a signal that indicates a speed of engine<br>
22. Exhaust from engine 22 passes through a catalyst 30. Torque from engine<br>
22 can be used for driving accessory loads. An air conditioning compressor 29 is<br>
an example of an accessory load. PCM 26 can employ a compressor clutch 31<br>
to selectively couple and decouple air conditioning compressor 29 from the<br>
engine torque. Other examples of accessory loads include an alternator, a<br>
power steering pump, an air pump, and the like.<br><br>
[0023] Powertrain 20 may also include an electric motor 32 that<br>
provides torque in accordance with a torque command 34. The torque of electric<br>
motor 32 can be combined with the torque of engine 22 to provide power for<br>
powertrain 20. While electric motor 32 is shown coupled in series with the torque<br>
output of engine 22, it should be appreciated that other configurations are also<br>
contemplated to be within the scope of this description. For example, electric<br>
motor 32 may be implemented as one or more electric motors that provide torque<br>
directly to wheels 36 instead of passing through a transmission 38.<br>
[0024] The combined torque of engine 22 and electric motor 32 is<br>
applied to an input of transmission 38. Transmission 38 may be an automatic<br>
transmission that switches gears in accordance with a gear change command 40<br>
from PCM 26. An output shaft of transmission 38 is coupled to an input of a<br>
differential gear 42. Differential gear 42 drives axles and wheels 36. Wheel<br>
speed sensors 44 generate signals that indicate a rotation speed of their<br>
respective wheels 36.<br>
[0025] PCM 26 receives an accelerator pedal position signal from a<br>
pedal position sensor 46. PCM 26 also receives a set speed signal from a cruise<br>
or speed control interface module 48. An adaptive cruise control sensor 50<br>
senses vehicles or other obstacles that are in a driving path and generates a<br>
signal that indicates a distance to the obstacles. The signal can be used to<br>
adjust a set speed that is provided via speed control interface module 48.<br>
[0026] Referring now FIGs. 2A and 2B, a functional block diagram is<br>
shown of a coordinated torque control system 100.   Coordinated torque control<br><br>
system 100 can be implemented with PCM 26. FIGs. 2A and 2B join together to<br>
depict the complete functional block diagram. A first connector label "A" on FIG.<br>
2A overlays a second connector label "A" on FIG. 2B. A first connector label "B"<br>
on FIG. 2A overlays a second connector label "B" on FIG. 2B. FIGs. 2A and 2B<br>
are collectively referred to as FIG. 2.<br>
[0027] Coordinated torque control system 100 employs a torque<br>
request backbone module 102 that determines a propulsion torque demand and<br>
communicates the propulsion torque demand to a propulsion torque control<br>
module 104. Torque request backbone module 102 determines the propulsion<br>
torque demand based on inputs from a plurality of torque requesting modules<br>
that are described below in more detail. The torque requesting modules include<br>
modules that want to affect one or more of actuators 24 to affect the engine<br>
torque. The propulsion torque demand represents the torque needed from<br>
engine 22 in order to satisfy the needs of the torque requesting modules such<br>
that they can carry out their respective control strategies.<br>
[0028]     Propulsion torque control module 104 controls one or more of<br>
actuators 24-1	24-M, i.e. actuators 24, based on the net propulsion torque<br>
demand. Actuators 24 affect the engine torque. Examples of actuators 24<br>
include an ignition module that delivers an ignition spark to the engine at a<br>
specified ignition timing, a fuel injection module that delivers a specified amount<br>
of fuel to the engine at a specified time, an electronic throttle control module that<br>
moves a throttle valve to a specified opening, and the like.<br><br>
[0029] Each torque requesting module is categorized as either an axle<br>
torque requesting module or a propulsion torque requesting module. Axle torque<br>
requesting modules control at least one of vehicle speed and vehicle traction with<br>
the road surface. Propulsion torque requesting modules control the output<br>
torque of the engine and electric motor 32. The axle torque requesting modules<br>
are shown in FIG. 2A and will now be described in more detail.<br>
[0030] A pedal position signal 108 represents a vehicle acceleration<br>
requested by the vehicle operator. Pedal position signal 108 may be generated<br>
by pedal position sensor 46. A driver torque request module 200 generates a<br>
driver torque request based on pedal position signal 108. The driver torque<br>
request represents the axle torque needed to accelerate the vehicle in<br>
accordance with at least one of pedal position signal 108, engine speed signal<br>
28, and vehicle speed signal 44.<br>
[0031] A cruise control torque request module 202 generates a cruise<br>
control torque request. The cruise control torque request represents an axle<br>
torque that is needed to maintain the vehicle at the set speed indicated via<br>
interface module 48. An adaptive cruise control torque request module 204 may<br>
communicate with cruise control torque request module 202 to modify the cruise<br>
control torque request based on the environment surrounding the vehicle. For<br>
example, adaptive cruise control torque request module 204 may request that the<br>
axle torque be reduced so that the vehicle decelerates and/or maintains at least<br>
a minimum following distance behind a second vehicle while the cruise control is<br><br>
active. An actual following distance can be indicated by the signal from adaptive<br>
cruise control sensor 50.<br>
[0032] Other axle torque requesting modules are represented by axle<br>
torque request modules 300-1, ..., 300-J, referred to collectively as axle torque<br>
request modules 300. A first example of an axle torque request module 300 is a<br>
traction/drag control module. The traction/drag control module determines axle<br>
torque changes needed to control positive wheel slip and negative wheel slip.<br>
Positive wheel slip refers to slip between a vehicle tire and the road surface due<br>
to excessive powertrain torque during acceleration. Negative wheel slip refers to<br>
slip between the vehicle tire and the road surface due to excessive braking axle<br>
torque during deceleration. The slip can be detected based on the signals from<br>
wheel speed sensors 44.<br>
[0033] A second example of an axle torque request module 300 is a<br>
vehicle over-speed protection module. The vehicle over-speed protection<br>
module determines a maximum axle torque limit in order to keep the vehicle<br>
speed below a predetermined speed limit.<br>
[0034] A third example of an axle torque request module 300 is a brake<br>
torque management module. The brake torque management module determines<br>
a maximum axle torque when the vehicle brakes are applied. The maximum axle<br>
torque prevents the axle torque from overcoming the brake torque of the vehicle<br>
brakes.<br>
[0035] A fourth example of an axle torque request module 300 is a<br>
stability control module.    The stability control module generates axle torque<br><br>
requests based on a yaw rate of the vehicle. A stability control module may be<br>
included in an electronic stability control system, such as the StabiliTrak system<br>
sold by General Motors .<br>
[0036] Torque control backbone module 102 includes an axle torque<br>
arbitration module 302 that receives the various torque requests and/or limits<br>
from driver torque request module 200, cruise control torque request module<br>
202, axle torque request modules 300, and a torque cutoff control module 306<br>
(shown in FIG. 2B). Torque cutoff control module 306 is described further below.<br>
Axle torque arbitration module 302 generates a net axle torque request based on<br>
the torque requests and/or limits and communicates the net axle torque request<br>
to an axle-to-propulsion torque conversion module 304. Axle-to-propulsion<br>
torque conversion module 304 converts the net axle torque request to a<br>
corresponding propulsion torque request based on at least one of the gear ratios<br>
in the axle differential gear 42, diameter of wheels 36, a gear ratio of<br>
transmission 38, and torque converter gain. Axle torque arbitration module 302<br>
communicates the corresponding propulsion torque request to a propulsion<br>
torque arbitration module 308 that is included in torque control backbone 102.<br>
[0037] Discussion will now move to the various propulsion torque<br>
requesting modules which are shown in FIG. 2B. A stall prevention module 402<br>
determines a minimum torque needed to keep engine 22 running. Stall<br>
prevention module 402 may increase the minimum torque based on input from at<br>
least one of an engine crank and stop module 404 and an engine capacity<br>
protection module 406.    Engine crank and stop module 404 increases the<br><br>
minimum torque request based on whether the engine is a new or green engine.<br>
A green requires a greater fuel injection pulse width to purge air from the fuel<br>
system when the vehicle is first assembled. To compensate for the increased<br>
fuel injection pulse width, engine crank and stop module 404 may also<br>
communicate with propulsion torque control module 104 so that it may retard the<br>
ignition timing and maintain the engine torque constant despite the increased fuel<br>
injector pulse width. Engine capacity protection module 406 provides a<br>
maximum torque limit for engine 22 based on mechanical limitations of<br>
powertrain 20. Examples of limitations include maximum torque limit of<br>
transmission 38, a maximum temperature limit of catalyst 30, and the like.<br>
[0038]     Propulsion   torque   arbitration   module   308   also   receives<br>
propulsion torque requests from one or more other propulsion torque request<br>
modules 500-1	500-K, referred to collectively as propulsion torque request<br>
modules 500. An example of a propulsion torque request module 500 includes a<br>
transmission torque request module that generates a torque request to reduce<br>
the engine torque during transmission shifts. Other propulsion torque request<br>
modules 500 can include at least one of an engine over-speed protection module<br>
and an engine idle speed control module. The engine over-speed protection<br>
module determines a propulsion torque limit to prevent the engine speed or RPM<br>
from exceeding a predetermined engine speed. The engine speed can be<br>
determined based on the signal from crankshaft position sensor 28. The engine<br>
idle speed control module determines the propulsion torque needed to maintain<br><br>
engine 22 at a predetermined idle speed during coasting or at idle with<br>
transmission in 38 in drive or neutral.<br>
[0039] Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 also receives reserve<br>
torque requests from one or more reserve torque request modules 502-1, ...,<br>
502-N, referred to collectively as reserve torque request modules 502. Reserve<br>
torque refers to torque that will be needed from engine 22 in the future. A first<br>
example of a reserve torque request module 502 is an air conditioning<br>
compressor torque compensation module. The air conditioning compressor<br>
torque compensation module requests a reserve torque so that the engine speed<br>
remains fairly constant when compressor clutch 31 engages and disengages.<br>
[0040] A second example of a reserve torque request module 502 is a<br>
catalyst light-off module. When the engine is started cold the catalyst light-off<br>
module requests that the engine spark be retarded to increase the exhaust gas<br>
temperature and thereby heat catalyst 30 to its conversion temperature. To<br>
compensate for the torque loss that is caused by the retarded spark the catalyst<br>
light-off module can also request that the throttle opening be increased while the<br>
spark is retarded.<br>
[0041] A third example of a reserve torque request module 502 is an<br>
intrusive diagnostic module. An intrusive diagnostic, such as an idle catalyst<br>
monitor, needs to change the air/fuel ratio of the engine to perform a diagnostic<br>
module. The intrusive diagnostic module therefore requests reserve torque to<br>
compensate for the torque effect of a diagnostic procedure that is about to<br>
execute.<br><br>
[0042] In some situations the propulsion torque needs to be minimized<br>
by momentarily turning off fuel and/or spark to the engine. Torque cutoff module<br>
306 generates the torque requests for these situations, which can include at least<br>
one of a clutch fuel cutoff and a deceleration fuel cutoff. A clutch fuel cutoff<br>
occurs when the vehicle is equipped with a manual transmission and the vehicle<br>
operator disengages the clutch. The clutch fuel cutoff prevents the engine speed<br>
from flaring beyond a predetermined speed when the clutch disengages and<br>
removes a load from the engine. The deceleration fuel cutoff occurs when the<br>
vehicle is coasting above a predetermined speed. The deceleration fuel cutoff<br>
helps increase engine braking. Deceleration fuel cutoffs are also communicated<br>
to axle torque arbitration module 302.<br>
[0043] Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 generates a total<br>
requested propulsion torque based on the torque requests and/or limits from the<br>
various propulsion torque request modules and the axle torque arbitration<br>
module. Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 communicates the total<br>
requested propulsion torque to propulsion torque control module 104.<br>
[0044] Torque control backbone 102 may also be configured to use<br>
with a hybrid electric vehicle. A hybrid electric vehicle includes engine 22 and<br>
electric motor 32, which cooperate to propel the vehicle. In a hybrid electric<br>
vehicle, the total axle torque request from axle torque arbitration module 302 is<br>
communicated to a hybrid control module 700. Hybrid control module 700<br>
determines how much propulsion torque will be provided by electric motor 32 and<br>
how much  will  be  provided  by  engine  22.     Hybrid  control  module  700<br><br>
communicates the engine's share of the propulsion torque to propulsion torque<br>
arbitration module 308. The electric motor's share of the propulsion torque is<br>
communicated to electric motor 32 via torque command 34. Axle to propulsion<br>
torque conversion module 304 may be combined with hybrid control module 700.<br>
Also, torque cutoff module 306 may communicate deceleration fuel cutoff torque<br>
requests to hybrid control module 700 instead of axle torque arbitration module<br>
302.<br>
