Novel Process for Producing Ramosetron or its Salt<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for<br>
producing ramosetron or a salt thereof that is useful as a<br>
pharmaceutical, especially as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist,<br>
more specifically, a therapeutic agent and/or preventive<br>
agent for digestive symptoms (nausea, emesis) caused by<br>
administration of an anti-malignant tumor agent (cisplatin<br>
or the like), diarrheal-type irritable bowel syndrome,<br>
diarrheal symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and the<br>
like.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
The chemical name of ramosetron is (-)-(R)-5-[(1-<br>
methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzimidazole, and it has the structure represented by the<br>
formula (II).<br><br><br>
It is known that ramosetron or a salt thereof has a<br>
potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonism (Patent Reference 1, Non-<br>
patent references 1 and 2), and it is on the market as a<br>
preventive or therapeutic agent for digestive symptoms<br>
(nausea, emesis) caused by administration of an anti-<br>
malignant tumor agent (cisplatin or the like). In<br>
addition, a possibility has been reported that ramosetron<br>
or a salt thereof may be useful as an agent for treating<br>
diarrheal-type irritable bowel syndrome or an agent for<br>
improving diarrheal symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome<br>
(Patent Reference 1), and its clinical trials are now in<br>
progress as an agent for treating diarrheal-type irritable<br>
bowel syndrome or an agent for improving diarrheal symptoms<br>
of irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a process for producing ramosetron or a salt<br>
thereof, the following production methods are known.<br>
Patent Reference 1 describes a production method<br>
shown by the following Production method A, namely a method<br>
for producing a tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivative (V) by<br>
allowing a heterocyclic compound (III) to react with a<br><br>
carboxylic acid represented by a formula (IV) or its<br>
reactive derivative.<br>
[0004]<br>
(Production method A)<br><br>
(In the formula, X2 is a single bond and binds to a carbon<br>
atom on the heterocyclic ring represented by Het.)<br>
[0005]<br>
As an illustrative production method of ramosetron,<br>
Patent Reference 1 describes a production method<br>
(Production method A-1 in which racemic ramosetron are<br>
obtained by using 1-methyl-1H-indole as the compound (III),<br>
and N,N-diethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzimidazole-5-<br>
carboxamide or N-[ (4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzimidazol-5-<br>
yl).carbonyl] pyrrolidine, which are acid amides, as the<br>
reactive derivative of compound (IV), and allowing them to<br>
undergo treatment with phosphorus oxychloride (Vilsmeyer<br>
reaction), and then their optical resolution is carried out<br>
by fractional crystallization using (+)-dibenzoyltartaric<br>
acid.<br><br>
[0006]<br>
In addition, the Patent Reference 1 exemplifies an<br>
acid halide as one of the reactive derivatives of the<br>
compound (IV), and also describes another production method<br>
of the compound (V) (Production method A-2) in which the<br>
heterocyclic compound (III) is condensed with an acid<br>
halide of the compound (IV) by the Friedel-Crafts acylation<br>
reaction using a Lewis acid as the catalyst. However,<br>
illustrative production example of ramosetron by the<br>
Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction is not described therein.<br>
[0007]<br>
Also, a method similar to the Production example A-1<br>
is described in Non-patent References 1 and 2 as a<br>
production method of ramosetron.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition, Non-patent Reference 3 describes a<br>
method for producing ramosetron labeled with 11C,<br>
represented by a Production method B. However, it<br>
discloses only the methylation step, and does not disclose<br>
a production method of nor-YM060 as the starting material.<br><br>
[0009]<br>
(Production method B)<br><br>
(In the formula, nor-YM060 means (R)-5-[(1H-indol-3-<br>
yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole which was<br>
provided by the present applicant, DMF means<br>
dimethylformamide.)<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems that the Invention is to Solve<br>
[0010]<br>
The conventional production methods of ramosetron are<br>
not industrially-satisfactory in terms of the production<br>
efficiency. Accordingly, great interests have been<br><br>
directed toward the development of an efficient method for<br>
producing ramosetron or a salt thereof, particularly a<br>
method for producing ramosetron which does not cause<br>
racemization and can keep the optical purity.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0011]<br>
The present in ventors have conducted extensive<br>
studies with the aim of developing an industrially more<br>
efficient production method of ramosetron or a salt<br>
thereof. As a result, it was found that, according to the<br>
following production method, ramosetron or a salt thereof<br>
may be produced with high efficiency through progress of<br>
the reaction which hardly reduce its optical purity and may<br>
keep its stereochemistry, thereby accomplishing the present<br>
invention.<br>
That is, according to the present invention, the<br>
novel production methods of ramosetron or a salt thereof<br>
shown in the following are provided.<br>
[0012]<br>
(1) (Production method 1)<br>
A method for producing ramosetron or a salt thereof,<br>
characterized in that a compound represented by a formula<br>
(I)<br><br><br>
[X in the formula represents a halogen]<br>
or a salt thereof is allowed to react with 1-methyl-1H-<br>
indole in the presence of a Lewis acid selected from the<br>
group consisting of a lower alkylaluminum dihalide, a di-<br>
lower alkylaluminum halide, a tri-lower alkylaluminum, and<br>
a lower alkylaluminum sesquihalide.<br>
(2)	(Production method 2)<br>
A method for producing ramosetron or a salt thereof,<br>
characterized in that a compound represented by the formula<br>
(I) described in (1) is prepared by allowing (R)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid or a salt<br>
thereof to react with a halogenation agent, and then<br>
allowed to react with 1-methyl-1H-indole in the presence of<br>
a Lewis acid selected from the group consisting of a lower<br>
alkylaluminum dihalide, a di-lower alkylaluminum halide, a<br>
tri-lower alkylaluminum, and a lower alkylaluminum<br>
sesquihalide.<br>
(3)	The production method described in (1) or (2),<br>
wherein the Lewis acid is diethylaluminum chloride or<br>
diethylaluminum sesquichloride.<br>
(4)	The production method described in (3), wherein<br>
solvent of the reaction is an. aromatic hydrocarbon.<br><br>
(5)	The production method described in (4), wherein<br>
the aromatic hydrocarbon is toluene.<br>
(6)	Ramosetron or a salt thereof produced by the<br>
production method described in (1).<br>
(7)	Ramosetron or a salt thereof produced by the<br>
production method described in (2).<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the<br>
composition shown below, which comprises ramosetron or a<br>
salt thereof, is also provided.<br>
(8)	A composition which comprises ramosetron or a<br>
salt thereof, characterized in that it contains 5-[(l-<br>
methyl-1H-indol-5-yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzimidazole or a salt thereof and/or 5-[(1-methyl-1H-<br>
indol-6-yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole or<br>
a salt thereof, in a total amount of less than 1% based on<br>
ramosetron or a salt thereof.<br>
Advantage of the Invention<br>
[0013]<br>
Since the reaction in the production method of the<br>
present invention progresses by keeping the<br>
stereochemistry, as is described later, ramosetron or a<br>
salt thereof having a high optical purity may be produced<br>
with a high yield from (R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof which is<br>
conventionally known and may be produced easily.<br><br>
[0014]<br>
On the other hand, in the production method A-1<br>
described in the Patent Reference 1, ramosetron is produced<br>
by condensing an acid amide compound and 1-methyl-1H-indole<br>
by the Vilsmeyer reaction and then carrying out optical<br>
resolution by fractional crystallization using (+)-<br>
dibenzoyltartaric acid. However, when the optical<br>
resolution is arranged at the after step of the production<br>
process, it becomes necessary to excessively use the<br>
material for the production of the unnecessary optical<br>
isomer which occupies the half part. However, even when an<br>
optically active acid amide compound is used as the<br>
starting material in the production method A-l, it is<br>
completely racemized at the step of Vilsmeyer reaction, so<br>
that it becomes necessary to carry out a treatment for<br>
increasing the optical purity after the reaction, in order<br>
to obtain ramosetron having a high optical purity. On the<br>
other hand, according to the method of the present<br>
invention, the reaction progresses with a high yield while<br>
keeping the stereochemistry, so that ramosetron having a<br>
high optical purity can be produced from the optically<br>
active compound (I) industrially efficiently. In addition,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane is used in the production method A-l as<br>
the solvent at the step of Vilsmeyer reaction, but it is<br>
considered now that it should not be used in the production<br>
of pharmaceutical preparations. On the other hand, toluene<br><br>
is suitably used in the production method of the present<br>
invention. In addition, in the production of ramosetron<br>
hydrochloride actually produced by the applicant by the<br>
production method A-1, crystals containing ramosetron are<br>
filtered 6 times in total in the steps of taking out and<br>
purifying racemic bodies of ramosetron, ramosetron (+)-<br>
dibenzoyltartarate and ramosetron hydrochloride, for the<br>
purpose of obtaining ramosetron hydrochloride having a high<br>
optical purity. On the other hand, as is described later,<br>
ramosetron hydrochloride having a high optical purity may<br>
be obtained by the production method of the present<br>
invention through once, or twice including its<br>
purification, of filtration, so that the handing is<br>
convenient.<br>
[0015]<br>
Also, the production method A-2 is a method for<br>
producing a tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivative (V) by<br>
allowing a heterocyclic compound (III) and an acid halide<br>
of the compound (IV) to undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation<br>
reaction using a Lewis acid as the catalyst. However, as<br>
described in the foregoing, an illustrative production<br>
example of ramosetron by this production method is not<br>
described therein. Also, the Patent Reference 1 describes,<br>
as a production example of analogous compounds, a method<br>
for producing 5-[(benzothiophen-3-yl)carbonyl]-4, 5, 6, 7-<br>
tetrahydrobenzimidazole and 5-[(2-methylbenzofuran-3-<br><br>
yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6;7-tetrahydrobenzimidazole by Friedel-<br>
Crafts acylation reaction respectively using aluminum<br>
chloride and tin tetrachloride as the Lewis acid, but it<br>
cannot be said that their yields are suitable. In<br>
addition, when the same reaction conditions were applied to<br>
the production of ramosetron, the yield was also low, and<br>
its purification was difficult to carry out due to the by-<br>
production of a tarry highly viscous substance. Thus, it<br>
was not able to industrially use Lewis acids which are<br>
generally and frequently used in the production of<br>
ramosetron. Accordingly, the present inventors have<br>
extensively examined on Lewis acids and, as a result,<br>
unexpectedly found that ramosetron can be produced with<br>
less by-products and high yield when a lower alkylaluminum<br>
dihalide, a di-lower alkylaluminum halide, a tri-lower<br>
alkylaluminum and a lower alkylaluminum sesquihalide were<br>
used as Lewis acids. In. addition, in the case of the<br>
production of ramosetron using the Lewis acids to be used<br>
in the present invention, it was revealed unexpectedly that<br>
the reaction progresses by hardly reducing the optical<br>
purity while keeping the stereochemistry when the reaction<br>
is carried out using the optically active compound (I).<br>
Based on this, according to the production method of the<br>
present invention, ramosetron having a high optical purity<br>
can be produced industrially efficiently from the optically<br>
active compound (I).<br><br>
[0016]<br>
In addition, labeled ramosetron is produced in the<br>
production method B, by the methylation of an optically<br>
active compound (V) with labeled methyl iodide. However,<br>
the production method B is a production method which<br>
requires nor-YM060 in order to label the 1-position of<br>
indol, so that the process becomes longer than the<br>
ramosetron production method, by a factor of 1 step. On<br>
the other hand, according to the present invention, the<br>
number of steps becomes short because the production does<br>
not require nor-YM060.<br>
[0017]<br>
Accordingly, the production method of the present<br>
invention is a superior production method in comparison<br>
with the conventional production methods, in terms of (1)<br>
high yield, (2) avoidance of the use of solvents which<br>
should not be used in producing pharmaceutical<br>
preparations, (2) less environmental loading, (3) shortened<br>
number of total steps and (4) improved convenience of the<br>
handling.<br>

The following illustratively describes the present<br>
invention based on examples, but the invention is not<br>
restricted by these examples.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
Example 1<br>
By heating a mixture of 4.05 g of (R)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid<br>
monohydrochloride (99.4% e.e.), 120 ml of dimethoxyethane<br>
and 5.47 g of thionyl chloride at 70°C for 2 hours, (R)-<br>
4, 5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole-5-carbonyl chloride was<br>
synthesized, and the solvent was evaporated under a reduced<br>
pressure. A 80 ml portion of toluene was added to the<br>
residue and again evaporated under a reduced pressure, and<br>
the residue was mixed with 120 ml of toluene and 5.24 g of<br>
1-methyl-1H-indole and cooled to -40°C in an atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen. A 30 ml portion of 1.0 mol/1 toluene solution of<br>
ethylaluminum sesquichloride was slowly added to this<br>
liquid and stirred at -40°C for 3 hours, and 10 ml of<br>
tetrahydrofuran was added thereto after the stirring. This<br>
liquid was slowly dispersed in 160 ml of water cooled at<br>
0°C, and after removing the organic layer, the water layer<br>
was washed with 40 ml of toluene and extracted by adding 80<br>
ml of 2-butanone and 50 ml of 20% sodium hydroxide aqueous<br>
solution thereto. The water layer was washed with 40 ml of<br>
2-butanone, and the organic layers were combined and washed<br>
twice with 20 ml of 10% brine and then with .4 ml of water.<br>
A 40 ml portion of ethanol was added to the thus obtained<br>
organic layer and evaporated under a reduced pressure, and<br>
40 ml of ethanol was again added to the residue and<br><br>
evaporated under a'reduced pressure. A 120 ml portion of a<br>
mixed solvent of ethanol and ethyl acetate (1:3) was added<br>
to the residue, and this was heated at 70°C for 1 hour by<br>
adding 5 ml ethyl acetate solution of 4 mol/1 hydrogen<br>
chloride and then slowly cooled to 0°C. The precipitated<br>
crystals were filtered, and the crystals were washed with<br>
an ethanol-ethyl acetate mixed solvent and then dried in<br>
vacuo at 50°C, thereby obtaining 4.98 g of (-)-(R)-5-[(1-<br>
methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzimidazole monohydrochloride (yield 78.8%, 99.5% e.e.).<br>

monohydrochloride (99.4% e.e.), 120 ml of dimethoxyethane<br>
and 5.47 g of thionyl chloride at 70°C for 2 hours, (R)-<br>
4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole-5-carbonyl chloride was<br>
synthesized, and the solvent was evaporated under a reduced<br>
pressure. A 80 ml portion of toluene was added to the<br><br>
residue and again evaporated under a reduced pressure, and<br>
the residue was mixed with 120 ml of toluene a'nd 5.24 g of<br>
1-methyl-1H-indole and cooled to -25°C in an atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen. A 33 ml portion of 1.8 mol/1 toluene solution of<br>
diethylaluminum chloride was slowly added to this liquid<br>
and stirred at -25°C for 2 hours, and 8 ml of<br>
tetrahydrofuran was added thereto after the stirring. This<br>
liquid was slowly dispersed in 100 ml of water which was<br>
cooled at 0°C, and then heated to 45°C. After removing the<br>
organic layer, the water layer was washed with 40 ml of<br>
toluene, and this was extracted by adding 80 ml of 2-<br>
butanone and 50 ml of 20% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution<br>
thereto. The water layer was washed with 40 ml of 2-<br>
butanone, and the organic layers were combined and washed<br>
twice with 20 ml of 10% brine and then with 4 ml of water.<br>
The thus obtained organic layer was evaporated under a<br>
reduced pressure, 40 ml of ethanol was added to the<br>
resulting residue and evaporated under a reduced pressure,<br>
and 40 ml of ethanol was again added to the residue and<br>
evaporated under a reduced pressure. A 120 ml portion of a<br>
