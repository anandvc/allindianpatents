the filing dates of October 1, 2001, February 25, 2002, and September 25, 2002, are<br>
hereby claimed, and their disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully<br>
set forth herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0003]	The invention relates generally to suturing devices and methods.<br>
[0004]	2. Description of Prior Art and Related Information<br>
[0005]	Suturing apparatus in the past have been required to have an<br>
elongate configuration and a low profile facilitating their use through cannulas in less<br>
invasive surgery. These devices have typically included opposing jaws which clamp on<br><br>
to the tissue to be sutured. Beyond this simple clamping motion, typically facilitated<br>
by scissor handles, the mechanism for threading a suture between the jaws and<br>
through the tissues have been exceedingly complex.<br>
[0006]	This complexity has derived primarily from the fact that the<br>
elongated, low profile configuration calls for an operating force that can be transmitted<br>
through an elongate tube. This force along the axis of the instrument must then be<br>
converted into a force extending generally perpendicular to the axis between the jaws.<br>
No simple structure has been devised to accommodate this transition. Furthermore,<br>
loading a suture onto a mechanism has also been complicated due to the complexity of<br>
the suturing mechanisms.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	In accordance with the present invention, structures and associated<br>
methods are disclosed which address these needs and overcome the deficiencies of<br>
the prior art.<br>
[0008]	In one aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a first jaw and a<br>
second jaw movable with respect to each other. A bendable needle is carried by the<br>
first jaw and adapted to carry a suture. The needle is movable between a first position<br>
wherein the needle is substantially housed within the jaw and a second position<br>
wherein a distal portion of the needle protrudes from the first jaw. The apparatus<br>
further comprises means for securing the suture in place prior to being carried by the<br>
bendable needle, and a suture receiver spaced apart from the first jaw and configured<br>
to disengage the suture carried by the bendable needle.<br>
[0009]	The securing means may comprise a cantilevered spring included in<br>
a distal portion of the first jaw, a groove defined in a distal portion of the first jaw, a<br>
flap, or an elastomeric pad. The first jaw defines an axis and further comprises a<br>
transition block adapted to guide the bendable needle in a direction substantially<br>
perpendicular to the axis.<br>
[0010]	In another aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a first jaw<br>
defining an ingress, a second jaw movable with respect to the first jaw, and a bendable<br>
needle carried by the first jaw and movable between a proximal position and a distal<br>
position. The needle defines a needle slot that may be aligned with the ingress to<br>
enable loading of a suture through the ingress into the needle slot.<br><br><br>
[0011]	The apparatus further comprises a suture receiver which may be<br>
disposed adjacent to the second jaw, or integral with the second jaw. The apparatus<br>
further comprises an actuator coupled to the bendable needle and configured for<br>
moving the bendable needle between the proximal position and the distal position.<br>
The actuator preferably comprises a thumb lever. The first jaw defines an axis and<br>
further comprises an axial slot in communication with the ingress. The ingress may<br>
comprise a lateral opening, and the needle slot may comprise a lateral slot.<br>
[0012]	A suture retrieving apparatus is also provided. The suture retrieving<br>
apparatus comprises a first jaw and a second jaw movable with respect to each other,<br>
a suture receiver spaced apart from the first jaw, the suture receiver being adapted to<br>
releasably retain a suture, and a bendable needle carried by the first jaw. The bendable<br>
needle is movable between a proximal position and a distal position. The bendable<br>
needle has a distal needle portion adapted to engage with the suture when the<br>
bendable needle is in the distal position. The distal needle portion comprises a hook.<br>
The second jaw may comprise the suture receiver.<br>
[0013]	A method is provided for suturing a tissue. The method comprises<br>
the steps of clamping a piece of tissue to be sutured, securing a suture in place for<br>
engagement with a bendable needle, engaging a suture with a bendable needle,<br>
carrying the suture toward a receiver with the bendable needle, retaining the suture<br>
with the receiver, and retracting the bendable needle to release the suture.<br><br><br>
[0014]	The step of clamping a tissue to be sutured comprises the step of<br>
capturing the piece of tissue with a first jaw and a second jaw. The method further<br>
comprises the step of advancing the bendable needle in an axial direction.<br>
[0015]	The step of carrying the suture toward a receiver with the bendable<br>
needle comprises the step of bending the bendable needle, and moving at least a<br>
portion of the bendable needle in a transverse direction.<br>
[0016]	A method is also provided for loading a suture onto a suturing<br>
apparatus. The method comprises the steps of housing a needle with a needle slot in a<br>
first jaw, biasing the needle in a distal direction with respect the first jaw so that the<br>
needle slot is not aligned with an ingress of the first jaw, aligning the needle slot with<br>
the ingress, disposing a suture through the ingress into the needle slot, and releasing<br>
the biased needle such that the needle engages the suture and carries the suture<br>
distally.<br>
[0017]	The step of aligning the needle slot with the ingress may comprise<br>
the step of moving the needle either proximally or distally. The step of moving the<br>
needle proximally comprises moving the needle proximally with a finger slide. The<br>
step of disposing a suture through the ingress into the needle slot comprises looping<br>
the suture about the ingress.<br>
[0018]	In summary, a suturing apparatus comprises a pair of jaws. A<br>
bendable needle housed in one of the jaws is adapted to carry a suture toward a suture<br>
receiver disposed adjacent to the opposite jaw. A transition block curves the needle<br>
and directs it in a direction generally not parallel to an axis of the carrying jaw. The<br><br><br>
needle may also be configured to retrieve a suture. A retaining mechanism holds a<br>
suture in place to be engaged by the needle. The jaw housing the needle may include a<br>
lateral opening through which the suture may be inserted. The needle may also<br>
include a lateral notch which may be aligned with lateral opening to receive the suture.<br>
An actuator coupled to the needle enables the user to move the needle proximally to<br>
align the notch with the lateral slot.<br>
[0019]	In another aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a proximal<br>
handle and an elongated distal shaft having a distal end; a grasping mechanism<br>
positioned adjacent to the distal end, the grasping mechanism including a top jaw and<br>
a bottom jaw, at least one of the top jaw and the bottom jaw hinged to the shaft at a<br>
position proximal to the distal end, the grasping mechanism operationally coupled to<br>
the handle for opening and closing the top jaw and the bottom jaw with respect to one<br>
another at the distal end; a slot extending vertically through the top jaw and the<br>
bottom jaw and extending proximally from the distal end to a slot end within at least<br>
one of the top jaw and the bottom jaw, the slot having a slot width tapering proximally<br>
toward the slot end for frictionally retaining an intermediate portion of a length of<br>
suture; and a suture needle longitudinally positionable within and distally deployable<br>
from the shaft, the needle having a open-sided notch engageable with the intermediate<br>
portion of suture, for passing the suture when the needle is deployed from the shaft,<br>
the needle operationally coupled to the handle for positioning and deployment.<br>
[0020]	In another aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a ratchet that<br>
locks unless positive disabled. In a preferred embodiment, such a suturing apparatus<br>
comprises a proximal handle and an elongated distal shaft having a distal end; a<br><br><br>
grasping mechanism positioned adjacent to the distal end, the grasping mechanism<br>
including a top jaw and a bottom jaw, at least one of the top jaw and the bottom jaw<br>
hinged to the shaft at a position proximal to the distal end for movement between an<br>
open position and a closed position; a jaw movement mechanism that operationally<br>
couples the grasping mechanism to the handle for opening and closing the top jaw and<br>
the bottom jaw with respect to one-another at the distal end; a spring that biases<br>
grasping mechanism to the open position; and a ratchet latch assembly that prevents<br>
the jaw movement mechanism from moving toward the open position unless positive<br>
action is taken to disable the ratchet latch assembly.<br>
[0021]	In another aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a needle<br>
movement mechanism that moves the needle distally when the needle movement<br>
mechanism is moved proximally. In a preferred embodiment, such a suturing<br>
apparatus comprises a bendable needle having a generally flat, narrow and elongate<br>
configuration, and a distal needle tip; a first jaw defining an axis and a needle channel<br>
that guides the bendable needle along the needle channel to a channel exit; a second<br>
jaw movable with respect to the first jaw for holding tissue to be sutured between the<br>
first and second jaws; the bendable needle reciprocally movable between a proximal<br>
needle position where the needle tip is resting inside the first jaw and a distal needle<br>
position where the needle tip is protruding from the first jaw; and a needle movement<br>
mechanism comprising a needle trigger that reciprocally moves between a distal<br>
trigger position and a proximal trigger position, the needle trigger operatively<br>
connected to the bendable needle to move the bendable needle distally when the<br>
needle trigger is pulled proximally.<br><br><br>
[0022]	In another aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a needle that<br>
automatically returns to a loading position. In a preferred embodiment, such a<br>
suturing apparatus comprises a handle assembly; an elongate shaft extending from a<br>
distal end of the handle assembly; a first jaw extending distally from the elongate shaft,<br>

sutured between the first and second jaws; a bendable needle having a generally flat,<br>
narrow and elongate configuration, a distal needle tip, and an open-sided needle notch,<br>
the bendabie needle reciprocally movable between a proximal needle position where<br>
the needle tip and open-sided needle notch are resting inside the first jaw and the<br>
suturing apparatus is ready for suture to be loaded into the first jaw via the suture<br>
loading ingress and a distal needle position where the needle tip and open-sided<br>
needle notch are protruding from the first jaw with the suture loaded into the first jaw<br>
via the suture loading ingress located on an opposite side of the tissue in the open-<br>
sided needle notch; a needle movement mechanism that reciprocally moves the needle<br>
distally and proximally between the proximal needle position and the distal needle<br>
position; and a spring that automatically returns the bendable needle to the proximal<br>
needle position and readies the suturing apparatus for suture to be loaded into the first<br>
jaw via the suture loading ingress.<br>
[0023]	In another aspect, a suturing apparatus comprises a means for<br>
loading suture in a single step. In a preferred embodiment, such a suturing apparatus<br>
comprises a handle assembly; an elongate shaft extending distally from the handle<br>
assembly; a first jaw extending distally from the elongate shaft, the first jaw having an<br><br><br>
axis, a top, a bottom, a needle channel that runs along the first jaw's axis and around a<br>
curve to a channel exit, and a suture loading ingress that extends through the first jaw<br>
from the top to the bottom and leads to a suture channel that also extends through the<br>
first jaw from the top to the bottom, the suture channel being in communication with<br>
and in substantial alignment with the needle channel; a second jaw movable with<br>
respect to the first jaw for holding-tissue to be sutured between the first and second<br>
jaws; a bendable needle having a generally flat, narrow and elongate configuration, a<br>

movable between a proximal needle position where the needle tip and open-sided<br>
needle notch are resting inside the first jaw and the suturing apparatus is ready for<br>
suture to be loaded into the first jaw via the suture loading ingress and a distal needle<br>
position where the needle tip and open-sided needle notch are protruding from the<br>
first jaw with the suture loaded into the first jaw via the suture loading ingress located<br>
on an opposite side of the tissue in the open-sided needle notch; and means for<br>
retaining suture loaded into the first jaw via the suture loading ingress prior to<br>
deployment of the bendable needle, the suture being loaded into the first jaw in a<br>
single step without regard to the position of the bendable needle and its open-sided<br>
needle notch.<br>
[0024]	In yet another aspect, a novel suturing needle comprises a needle<br>
with a proximal end and a distal end, with at least a distal portion of the needle formed<br>
from a bendable material having a generally flat, narrow and elongate configuration,<br>
and with a sharp needle tip located at a distal end of the distal portion; and a finger tab<br><br><br>
connected to the bendable needle at or near a proximal end of the needle for loading<br>

the end slot, the forward translation and momentary sideways movement of the needle<br>
as it engages the suture, the creation of a suture loop, and the retraction of the needle<br>
to the resting position.<br>
[0082]	The invention and its various embodiments can now be better<br>
understood by turning to the following detailed description wherein illustrated<br>
embodiments are described. It is to be expressly understood that the illustrated<br>
embodiments are set forth as examples and not by way of limitations on the invention<br>
as ultimately defined in the claims.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
AND BEST MODE OF INVENTION<br>
[0083]	A first preferred embodiment of a suturing apparatus is illustrated in<br>
Figure 1 and designated generally by the reference numeral 10. The apparatus 10 is<br>
illustrated to have an elongate configuration with a proximal end 12 and a distal end 14.<br>
A handle assembly 16 is disposed at the proximal end 12 and includes scissor handles<br>
18 and 21 as well as an actuator 23. A pair of opposing jaws 25 and 27 are disposed at<br>
the distal end and are coupled to the handle assembly 16 through an elongate shaft or<br>
tube 29. In one embodiment, the upper jaw 25 is pivotal with respect to the lower jaw<br>
27 as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
[0084]	In the illustrated embodiment the lower jaw 27 includes a needle 32<br>
of particular interest to the present invention. In this case, the needle 32 includes a<br>
body having a generally flat, narrow and elongate configuration. As shown in Figures 1-<br>
3, the needle 32 is formed from a bendable material so that it can be moved generally<br>
with an axial force provided, for example, by a user's thumb, and can be bent on a<br>
curve, for example, to 90°, to move generally perpendicular to the axis and toward the<br>
opposing upper jaw 25. It is to be expressly understood that the needle 32 can be<br>
substantially straight, as shown in Figure 1, and then be bent at any angle and<br>
advanced in any direction away from the axis. The actuator 23, which preferably<br>
comprises a thumb rocker or slide, is coupled to the needle 32. The actuator 23<br>
enables a user to advance the needle 32 distally to a protruding, operative position and<br>
proximally to a retracted, inoperative position.<br><br><br>
[0085]	Threading this needle 32 with a suture 34 enables the needle to be<br>
deployed through the tissue and to carry with it the suture 34 to be threaded. The<br>
opposing jaw 25 may include an optional receiver which is adapted to remove the<br>
suture from the needle 32 as the needle 32 is withdrawn back into the lower jaw 27.<br>
At this point, the suture extends through the tissue and into the upper jaw. Removal of<br>
the jaws from the tissue, as illustrated in Figure 4 permits withdrawal of the apparatus<br>
10 leaving the suture in place for tying or further manipulation. A suture receiver is<br>
optional since the tissue itself may frequently serve as a receiver for the suture once<br>
the needle is retracted.<br>
[0086]	In this embodiment, the lower jaw is illustrated in Figure 5A to<br>
include an elongate configuration and a channel 36 adapted to receive the needle 32.<br>
The needle is bent at the distal end of this jaw 27 and up through a transition block 38<br>
which aides in curving the needle 32 and directing it toward a suture receiver. Though<br>
the illustrated embodiment shows the transition block 38 curving the needle 32<br>
perpendicularly with respect to the axis of the lower jaw 27, the transition block 38<br>
may be configured to curve and direct the needle 32 at any particular angle or direction<br>
that is generally unparallel to the axis of the fower jaw 27. Figure 5A shows the needle<br>
retracted and Figure 5B shows the needle 32 deployed and provided with a slot 40 to<br>
carry the suture 34 to the opposing jaw 25. This configuration is further illustrated in<br>
the radial cross-section view of Figure 6.<br>
[0087]	In the upper jaw 25, a suture receiver 41 is provided to remove the<br>
suture 34 from the needle 32. A metal or elastomeric flap, or paddle, 43 is provided to<br>
engage the needle 32 and threaded suture 34 as illustrated in Figure 7A. This flap 43<br><br><br>
forces the suture 34 from the needle slot 40 as the needle 32 is withdrawn as<br>
illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
[0088]	In a similar embodiment, the needle 32 and threaded suture 34 is<br>
forced through an elastomeric pad 45 which similar engages the suture 34 and<br>
removes it from the needle slot 40 as the needle 32 is withdrawn as illustrated in<br>
Figure 8B.<br>
[0089]	A second preferred embodiment of a suturing apparatus is<br>
illustrated in Figure 9 which is a cross-section view similar to Figure 6, but showing a<br>
needle 32 which functions as a retriever rather than a carrier. In this embodiment, the<br>
suture 34 is initially carried by the upper jaw 25. A needle slot 42 in this case extends<br>
distally from the side of the needle 32. When this needle 32 and slot 42 are extended,<br>
as illustrated in Figure 10A, the slot 42 engages the suture 34 in the upper jaw 25. As<br>
the needle 32 is withdrawn, the suture is retrieved in the needle slot 42 and carried<br>
back through the tissue. The final step in this process is the same as previously<br>
discussed with reference to Figure 4.<br>
[0090]	It will be apparent that this apparatus 10 could also operate with the<br>
needle 32 carried by the upper jaw 25. Such a feature is shown in a third preferred<br>
embodiment illustrated in the cross-sectional view of Figure 11 where the needle 32<br>
functions as a suture carrier. In particular, a suture slot 40 defined in the needle 32<br>
comprises an opening 50 that is located distally to an end 52 such that the slot 40<br>
faces the receiver, or lower jaw 27. A suture 34 is thus carried by the needle 32<br>
toward the opposing, lower jaw 27.<br><br><br>
[0091]	In Figure 12, a fourth preferred embodiment of a suturing apparatus<br>
comprises a suture retrieving device wherein the needle 32 is carried by the upper jaw<br>
25, In this case, the needle 32 functions as a retriever of the suture 34. The needle 32<br>
defines a slot 42 with an opening 54 that is located proximally to an end 56 such that<br>
the slot 42 faces away from the opposing, lower jaw 27. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
a distal portion of the needle 32 is thus preferably shaped as a hook.<br>
[0092]	A fifth preferred embodiment of a suturing apparatus is illustrated in<br>
Figure 13 and designated generally by the reference numeral 110. In Figures 13-15, the<br>
apparatus 110 includes an elongate configuration with a proximal end 112 and a distal<br>
end 114. A handle assembly (not shown) is disposed at the proximal end 112 and may<br>
include scissor handles which are operatively coupled to a pair of opposing suturing<br>
jaws 116 and 118 at the distal end 114. An elongate shaft or tube 121 couples the jaws<br>
116,118 to the handle assembly. In one embodiment, the upper jaw 116 is pivotal with<br>
respect to the lower jaw 118 as illustrated in Figure 13-15.<br>
[0093]	In the illustrated embodiment, the lower jaw 118 includes a retaining<br>
mechanism 123 of particular interest to the present invention. The apparatus 110 may<br>
include a handle assembly, a bendable needle 125 housed in one of the jaws 116,118,<br>
and a suture receiver included in the other of the jaws 116,118 as described above.<br>
Since the retaining mechanism 123 serves to securely hold a suture 127 while easily<br>
permitting its release when engaged by the needle 125, the mechanism 123 is<br>
preferably included in the jaw that houses the needle 125. For example, if the needle<br>
125 is housed in the upper jaw 116, then the retaining mechanism 123 would also be<br>
included in the upper jaw 116.<br><br><br>
[0094]	A first preferred securing mechanism 123 comprises a spring 129<br>
formed at a distal tip 132 of the jaw 118. The spring 129 includes a cantilever portion<br>
134 bent back on itself. A wedge, or groove/136 is defined between the cantilever<br>
portion 134 and an opposite wall 138 as shown more clearly in Figures 16 and 17. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment of Figures 13-16, the securing mechanism 123 is formed<br>
integrally with the jaw 118. To assemble the suture 127, a first end 141 is held beneath<br>
the jaw 118 and the other end 143 above the jaw 118. The ends 141,143 may be pulled<br>
in a proximal direction such that the suture 127 is wedged into the groove 136. When<br>
disposed in the groove 136, the cantilever portion 134 biases the suture 127 against the<br>
opposite wall 138, thus pinching the suture 127 securely in place for engagement by the<br>
needle 125.<br>
[0095]	The biasing force of the spring 129 is configured such that the suture<br>
127 is both held securely absent engagement by the needle 125, and yet is permitted to<br>
be easily released upon engagement, it is to be expressly understood, therefore, that<br>
the spring 129 may comprise a variety of mechanisms capable of abutting, or pinching,<br>
the suture 127 against an opposing surface while permitting its release upon<br>
engagement with a needle. The groove 136 is preferably aligned with or disposed<br>
adjacent to a needle exit port 145 such that when the ends 141,143 are tugged<br>
proximally, a portion 147 of the suture 127 lies along the path of the transversely<br>
extending needle 125.<br>
[0096]	In Figure 18, a second preferred retaining mechanism 123a may<br>
include a spring mechanism 129a formed separately from the jaw 118a. The spring<br><br><br>
mechanism 129a includes an anchor 149 configured to fit within a slot 152 defined in<br>
the jaw 118a.<br>
[0097]	In Figures 19 and 20, a third preferred retaining mechanism 123b<br>
comprises a zigzag groove 154 that becomes increasingly narrow as it extends<br>
proximally. The zigzag pattern in combination with the proximal tapering facilitates a<br>
tight fit when the suture 127 is drawn proximally. In particular, the proximally tapered<br>
configuration of the groove 154 pinches the suture in place as it drawn proximally<br>
while the zigzag pattern prevents the suture 127 from being distally disengaged from<br>
the jaw 118b.<br>
[0098]	A sixth embodiment of a suturing apparatus is shown in Figures 21-<br>
27 and designated generally by the reference numeral 210. The apparatus 210<br>
comprises a first jaw 220 and a second jaw 222 that are pivotal with respect to each<br>
other. In Figures 21-23, the first jaw 220 is configured to house a bendable needle 224.<br>
This needle carrying jaw 220 may comprise either the lower or upper jaw of the<br>
apparatus 210. The bendable needle 224 is substantially disposed in a channel 226<br>
within the first jaw 220 when the needle 224 is in a non-operative, or non-piercing,<br>
position.<br>
[0099]	In Figure 22, the first jaw 220 defines an opening, or ingress 228,<br>
that is in communication with an axial slot 231. The ingress 228 is preferably provided<br>
with a relatively wide mouth 233 is open to one of the sides of the first jaw 220. This<br>
preferably lateral ingress 228 tapers as it approaches the axial slot 231.<br><br>
[0100]	In Figure 23, the needle 224 of particular interest to the invention is<br>
shown out of position, overlaying the first jaw 220 for clarity. When assembled, the<br>
needle 224 would reside in the channel 226 as discussed above. The needle 224<br>
comprises a lateral slot, or notch 235 (see Figure 28). An edge defining the notch 235<br>
is preferably radiused, or smoothed, such it would not cut a suture. As best shown in<br>
original Figure 28, the needle 224-comprises distal portions that define a sharp needle<br>
tip 242, notch or slot portions that define the notch or slot 235 and its associated<br>
opening, and first and second void portions that define a first distal crescent-shaped<br>
void 237 and an adjacent second proximal crescent-shaped void 239. In the preferred<br>
needle of original Figure 28, the distal portions that define the sharp needle tip 242 are<br>
equally bifurcated by the needle's axis. As further shown in Figure 28, the slot portions<br>
defining the slot 235 define a base and a channel extending laterally of the base, the<br>
preferred base being configured as a circle with a diameter that is greater than a width<br>
of the channel. The voids 237, 239 collectively provide flexibility that is spread out on<br>
either side of the notch 235, over a greater length of the needle 224, such that all<br>
stresses do not collect at the notch 235 when the needle 224 is bent. The notch 235 is<br>
preferably disposed between the voids 237,239. As further shown in original Figure<br>
28, the first void 237 is shaped like a crescent with a first radius and a first axial length<br>
and the second void 239 is shaped like a crescent with a second radius greater than<br>
the first radius and with a second axial length greater than the first axial length.<br>
[0101]	In a rest state, as shown in original Figure 23, the needle 224 is<br>
generally straight and may be biased to any rest position with respect to the ingress<br>
228. For example, the rest position may comprise the notch 235 being disposed<br><br><br>
distally to the ingress 228, as shown in Figure 23, or proximally to the ingress 228. To<br>
load a suture, the needle 224 is moved to a loading position whereby the notch 235 is<br>
aligned with the ingress 228 as shown in Figure 24. If the needle 224 is biased such<br>
that the notch 235 is distal to the ingress 228, alignment is reached by moving the<br>
needle 224 in a proximal direction with respect to the first jaw 220. Accordingly, if the<br>
needle 224 were biased such that the notch 235 is proximal to the ingress 228,<br>
alignment is reached by moving the needle 224 in a distal direction with respect to the<br>
first jaw 220. Figure 25 illustrates a preferred handle assembly 243 of the suturing<br>
apparatus 210. In Figure 25, a manually operable actuator 244 is coupled to the needle<br>
to enable movement, proximally and distally, thereof. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
the actuator 244 preferably comprises a thumb lever, or rocker, that may be cocked<br>
backward by a user's thumb, thereby moving the needle proximally to align the notch<br>
with the ingress, and moved forward, thereby advancing the needle distally.<br>
[0102]	Figure 26 illustrates a suture 246 being loaded onto the apparatus<br>
210. The suture 246 is formed into a loop and threaded into the ingress 228. With the<br>
suture 246 held slightly taut across the first jaw 220, the suture 246 has entered the<br>
ingress 228 and is now disposed in the notch of the needle. The finger slide, shown in<br>
Figure 25, may now be released, thereby distally biasing the needle with the captured<br>
suture 246 to the resting position as shown in Figure 27. It will be appreciated that the<br>
axial slot 231 of the first jaw 220 allows the captured suture 246 to travel freely as it is<br>
carried by the needle 224.<br>
[0103]	A transition block 248 is provided at a distal portion of the first jaw<br>
220 and may be integral with or separate from the jaw 220, The transition block 248<br><br><br>
may be adapted to curve the needle and direct it at any desired angle, shown in the<br>
illustrated embodiment as generally perpendicular to the axis of the first jaw 220.<br>
[0104]	In Figures 26 and 27, the second jaw 222 comprises a distal hook<br>
251 that defines an aperture 253 with a side opening 255. When the jaws 220, 222 are<br>
clamped on a piece of tissue, the aperture 253 is configured to enable the needle to<br>
pass through after piercing the tissue. As the needle 224 is retracted the tissue acts as<br>
a suture receiver by holding on to the suture 246 while the needle 224 is withdrawn.<br>
This leaves a loop or free line of suture 246 on the side of the tissue in contact with the<br>
jaw 222. The hook 251 can then be placed in the loop and pulled. Alternatively, the<br>
two jaws 220,222 can be grasped on the free line of suture and pulled through the<br>
tissue. In Figure 25, a stationary finger support 257 serves as a counterforce plate for<br>
the actuator 244.<br>
[0105]	In Figure 28, the preferred bendable needle 224 comprises a distal<br>
geometry that facilitates a smooth piercing of tissue by preventing the tissue from<br>
being snagged or caught by any part of the needle 224. The needle 224 comprises a<br>
notch side 259 and an opposite, void side 262. In particular, the needle 224 comprises<br>
a straight, notch-side edge 264 located proximally to a notch edge defining the notch<br>
235. The needle 224 also defines a needle axis "A" that extends generally parallel to<br>
the notch-side edge 264.<br>
[0106]	As the needle 224 pierces a tissue, the tissue will travel along a<br>
notch-side ramp 266 that leads to a distal ledge 268 disposed distally of the notch<br>
edge defining the notch 235. As shown, a distal notch edge extends from the base and<br><br><br>
laterally from the axis for a first distance and a proximal notch edge that extends<br>
laterally from the base and laterally from the axis for a second distance that is less than<br>
the first distance. It will be appreciated that the distal ledge 268 is spaced a transverse<br>
distance "B" from the axis "A" while a proximal ledge 271 is spaced a transverse<br>
distance "C" from the axis "A." In the preferred embodiment, distance "B" is greater<br>
than distance "C" such that the distal ledge 268 pushes the pierced tissue outward to<br>
help keep the tissue from getting caught in the notch 235. As the tissue travels over<br>
the notch 235, a generally rounded bump that is associated with the proximal ledge<br>
271 further prevents the tissue from getting snagged.<br>
[0107]	On the opposite, void side 262, first and second void edges define<br>
the first and second voids 237, 239 that distribute the stresses more evenly across the<br>
needle 224 and around the notch 235 when the needle 224 is bent, such that the<br>
stresses are minimized near the notch 235. The opening to the notch 235 is directed<br>
distally such that the suture is forced into the needle during deployment through the<br>
tissue and so that the suture releases easily as the needle is retracted.<br>
[0108]	A further preferred embodiment of a suture receiver 280 is<br>
illustrated in Figures 29 and 30. The receiver 280 may, for example, be carried by a<br>
jaw opposite to the jaw housing a needle. The suture receiver 280 comprises a pair of<br>
flaps, or paddles, 282 disposed in a receiver housing 284. The paddles 282 are<br>
preferably configured to abut one another at a pinch point 286, as shown in Figure 30,<br>
to permit a needle to travel therebetween while retaining a carried suture when the<br>
needle is retracted. As discussed above, employment of a suture receiver is optional<br>
as the pierced tissue itself may often time serve as a suture receiver. In particular,<br><br><br>
after a needle carrying a suture has pierced the piece of tissue, the pierced tissue often<br>
times sufficiently retains the suture in the form of a loop as the needle is retracted.<br>
[0109]	In Figure 31, a first preferred embodiment of a hook, or barb 291, is<br>
formed at the distal end of a jaw, preferably the second jaw opposite to the first jaw<br>
housing the bendable needle. The barb 291 is configured to hook a looped suture that<br>
is retained, for example, by the tissue itself after the bendable has been retracted. In<br>
Figure 32, a distal end of a jaw may alternatively be formed with a pair of barbs 293.<br>
[0110]	The above-described embodiments generally represent a significant<br>
advance in the suture passing art because they permit suture to be retained in a device<br>
for delivery to a surgical site and in particular via an arthroscopic cannula, permit the<br>
tissue to be grasped and re-grasped if necessary, and permit the suture to be pushed<br>
through the tissue with a reciprocating bendable needle. However, improvements are<br>
still possible in terms of how the suture is loaded into the passer for capture by the<br>
needle, the construction of the needle, and the overall simplification of needle<br>
deployment.<br>
[0111]	FIGS 33-48 relate to a new, seventh, and presently preferred<br>
embodiment that adds a number of significant advancements.<br>
[0112]	FIG. 33 is a side view of a novel suture passing apparatus 310 and<br>
FIGS. 34-36 show an improved bendable needle 400 for use with the suture passing<br>
apparatus 310. As shown in FIG. 33, the suture passing apparatus 310 generally<br>
comprises a handle assembly 320 located at a proximal end 312, an elongate shaft 330<br>
extending from the handle assembly 320, and a grasping mechanism formed by a pair<br><br><br>
of jaws 340,350 supported at a distal end 314 of the elongate shaft 330 and a jaw<br>
movement mechanism 360 and related ratchet latch assembly 370 (described more<br>
fully below). The preferred handle assembly 320 is formed from two halves, a left half<br>
321 and a right half 322 (not shown) held together by a plurality of screws 323, and the<br>
elongate shaft 330 is held between the two halves with a handle-to-shaft pin 324 that<br>
engages a notch (not shown) at a-proximal end of the shaft 330. The jaws include a<br>
fixed jaw 340 and a moveable jaw 350. The moveable jaw 350, as shown, is pivotally<br>
secured to a distal end of the shaft with a jaw-to-shaft pin 352.<br>
[0113]	As further shown in FIG. 33, and described more fully below, the<br>
novel suture passing apparatus 310 includes two mechanisms, a jaw movement<br>
mechanism 360 (and related ratchet latch assembly 370) for opening and closing the.<br>
jaw assembly, and a needle movement mechanism 380 for translating the needle back<br>
and forth.<br>
[0114]	The jaw movement mechanism 360 opens and closes the moveable<br>
jaw 350 and is manipulated by way of a jaw trigger 361. The prior embodiments<br>
required the surgeon to proactively move the jaw in both the open and closed<br>
directions. For simplified use in this embodiment, the moveable jaw 350 is optionally<br>
biased open and then moved toward the closed position relative to the fixed jaw 340<br>
when the surgeon squeezes the jaw trigger 361. In addition, the jaw movement<br>
mechanism 360 may optionally include a superelastic element that deforms under<br>
load to limit jaw closing force.<br><br><br>
[0115]	As already noted, the ratchet latch assembly 370 relates to the jaw<br>
movement mechanism 360. The preferred ratchet latch assembly 370 is transparent<br>
in its operational nature in that it locks without positive action by the user, but can be<br>
disabled with simple depression of a release button, and all without the operator<br>
having to change his hand position. In particular, then the jaw trigger 361 is pulled, a<br>
moving portion 373 of the ratchet latch assembly 370 travels freely into the handle<br>
assembly 320, but through a mechanical interaction more fully described below,<br>
prevents the jaw trigger 361 from returning to an open position until later released. For<br>
that purpose, the preferred ratchet latch assembly 370 features a ratchet release or<br>
finger pad 371 such that the ratchet latch assembly 370 acts like a ratchet when no<br>
load is applied to the finger pad 371, while a simple depression of the finger pad 371<br>
releases the ratchet latch assembly 370 and permits the surgeon to vary the position<br>
of the jaw trigger 361 and moveable jaw 350 as desired (e.g. for repositioning the jaws<br>
as necessary prior to placement of the suture), and if permitted, to return to their open<br>
positions.<br>
[0116]	FIGS. 34-36 illustrate the bendable needle 400 that is intended for<br>
use with the suture passing apparatus of FIG. 33. For referential purposes of, the<br>
needle 400 has a proximal end 412 and a distal end 414. As shown, the needle 400 is<br>
formed from a proximal needle body 401 that has a slotted distal end 402, and a flat<br>
bendable extension 403 that within and is welded to the slotted distal end 402 of the<br>
needle body 401. The distal end 414 of the bendable needle 400 is similar to the<br>
previously preferred needle of FIG. 28 in that it has a needle tip 404, a needle notch<br>
405 on its side, and a notch-side ramp 406 between the tip 404 and the notch 405.<br><br><br>
However, the presently preferred needle 400 uniquely cooperates with the suture<br>
passing apparatus for purposes of loading the suture in a novel way (as described<br>
below), and it includes some novel construction features that make it easier to use and<br>
safer.<br>
[0117]	Focusing on the differences that constitute the novel construction<br>
for the moment, one can see that the previously disclosed needle body had a right-<br>
angle bend at its proximal end that engaged an aperture in a thumb-operated actuator<br>
(see e.g. FIG. 25), whereas the needle 400 may include a plastic tab 406 at its<br>
proximal end 412 that functions as a proximal loading flag. The preferred plastic tab<br>
406 is made of HDPE, polyethylene, and formed onto the needle body 401 in known<br>
manners, but any suitable material and or assembly method may be used.<br>
[0118]	The plastic tab 406 offers some unique advantages. First, it<br>
provides a convenient finger grip for loading the bendable needle 400 into the suture<br>
passer 310. In addition, it optionally melts upon autoclaving, thereby enhancing<br>
patient safety by effectively preventing reuse of the needle 400.<br>
[0119]	FIG. 37 is a partially-exploded perspective view of the preferred<br>
suture passing apparatus 310 and the bendable needle 400 that is loaded into the<br>
suture passing apparatus. In particular, the dashed line shows how the needle 400 is<br>
loaded into the breech or proximal end of the elongate shaft 330 via a chamber 325<br>
located on a top side of the handle assembly 320. As will be more fully described with<br>
reference to further figures, after the needle 400 is fully inserted into the elongated<br>
shaft 330, the loading flag 406 is pressed down into a needle receiver 390. The needle<br><br><br>
receiver 390 is moved back and forth by the surgeon's manipulation of the needle<br>
trigger 381.<br>
[0120]	FIG. 38 is a fully-exploded perspective view of the preferred suture<br>
passing apparatus 310 and the bendable needle 400. Here, one can see the detailed<br>
construction of the preferred device, including the components of the jaw movement<br>
mechanism 360, ratchet latch assembly 370, and needle movement mechanism 380.<br>
For ease of description, the foregoing mechanisms will be described with reference to<br>
FIGS. 39-41, which can be reviewed in conjunction with the fully-exploded perspective<br>
view of FIG 38.<br>
[0121]	FIGS. 39-41 are cross-section side views of the suturing apparatus<br>
310 and bendable needle 400 loaded therein. FIG. 39 is a full cross-section, whereas<br>
FIGS. 40 and 41 that selectively omit some of the other components, or only shown<br>
them in broken line, in order to emphasize the construction and operation of the jaw<br>
movement and needle movement mechanisms, 360, 380, respectively.<br>
[0122]	FIG. 40 focuses on the jaw movement mechanism 360 and related<br>
ratchet latch assembly 370 by showing much of the overall apparatus 310 in broken<br>
lines and by strategically eliminating the components associated with the needle<br>
movement mechanism 380 (see Figure 42). As shown, the jaw movement<br>
mechanism 360 comprises a jaw trigger 361, a jaw trigger pin 362, a jaw trigger push<br>
rod 363, a jaw lever spring 364, a link 365, an actuator 368, and, lastly, the moveable<br>
jaw 350 itself. In operation, when the jaw trigger 361 is squeezed, it pivots about the<br>
jaw trigger pin 362 along arc J1, and the jaw trigger push rod 363 compresses the jaw<br><br><br>
lever spring 364 which, as noted earlier, tends to bias the jaw trigger 361, moveable<br>
jaw 350, and overall jaw motion mechanism 360 in the open position.<br>
[0123]	As the jaw trigger 361 is moved along arc J1, an upper portion of the<br>
jaw trigger 362 is moved through a corresponding, but smaller radius arc J2. In this<br>
vicinity, a trigger-to-link pin 366 connects the jaw trigger 361 to the link 365, and<br>
further downstream, a link-to-actuator pin 367 connects the link 365 to the actuator<br>
368. Through this series of connections, the arcuate motion of the jaw trigger 361<br>
along arcs J1 and J2 is converted into translational movement of the actuator 368<br>
along arrow J3. As best shown by FIGS. 38, 39 and 40, the elongate shaft 330 is<br>
provided with a plurality of guide pins 331, two from each side, and an actuator channel<br>
333 that runs along its length. The actuator 368 slides back and forth within shaft's<br>
actuator channel 333.<br>
[0124]	The actuator 368 is, in turn, connected to a lower portion of the<br>
moveable jaw 350 via an actuator-to-jaw pin 351 that is located slightly below the jaw-<br>
to-shaft pin 352 about which the moveable jaw 350 rotates. As such, when the jaw<br>
trigger 361 is squeezed along arc J1 the upper portion of the trigger 361 is moved along<br>
arc J2, the actuator 368 is translated along arrow J3, the proximal end of the moveable<br>
jaw 350 is rotated along arc J4, and the distal end of the moveable jaw 350 is rotated<br>
along arc J5, i.e. moved toward a closed direction.<br>
[0125]	FIG. 40 also illustrates the preferred ratchet latch assembly 370 that<br>
includes a finger pad 371, a moving portion 373 having sloped teeth 374, and a<br>
separate fixed portion 377 that also has sloped teeth 378. The ratchet latch assembly<br><br><br>
also includes a ratchet latch spring 375 that provides a light spring force to bias sloped<br>
teeth 374 of the moving portion 373 against the sloped teeth 378 of the fixed portion<br>
377. The ratchet latch assembly 370 prevents the jaw trigger 361, biased to the<br>
opened position by the jaw lever push rod 363 and jaw lever spring 364, from moving<br>
to the open position until desired. In particular, the sloping teeth 374 readily slide over<br>
the sloping teeth 378 when the jaw trigger is squeezed along arc J1 in a<br>
counterclockwise direction to close the moveable jaw 350, but the teeth 374,378 tend<br>
to lock together to prevent the jaw trigger 361 from returning in the clockwise direction<br>
and opening the moveable jaw 350. When the surgeon desires to open the moveable<br>
jaw 350, he simply depresses the finger pad 371 which rocks the sloped teeth on the<br>
moveable portion 373 away from the sloped teeth 378 on the fixed portion 377. At<br>
that point, the jaw spring 365 tends to open the jaw movement mechanism 360, as<br>
controlled by the surgeon's finger on the finger pad 371. A further beneficial aspect of<br>
the novel handle mechanism is a "ratchet on demand" feature. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, this feature is provided by the placement of the ratchet button or finger<br>
pad 371 on an upper portion of the jaw trigger 361. This enables the surgeon to choose<br>
whether or not to use the locking feature by varying how he grips the handle with his<br>
fingers — squeezing the jaw trigger 361 without depressing the finger pad 371 permits<br>
the ratchet latch assembly 370 to naturally engage, whereas moving the jaw trigger<br>
361 with light but continuous finger pressure on the finger pad 371 enables a repeated<br>
opening and closing of the jaw 350 without engaging the ratchet latch assembly 370.<br>
In order to permit the surgeon to enable or disable the ratchet latch assembly as<br>
desired by varying the pressure applied to the finger pad 371 through the motion of the<br>
jaw trigger 361, the spring force of the ratchet latch spring 375 that affects the finger<br><br>
pad 371 is much less than the spring force of the jaw lever spring 364 that affects the<br>
overall jaw trigger 361.<br>
[0126]	FIG. 41 focuses on the needle movement mechanism 380 in the<br>
context of the overall apparatus 310 shown in broken lines and, in this case, by<br>
strategically eliminating the components associated with the jaw movement<br>
mechanism 360 and ratchet latch assembly 370 (see Figure 41). As shown, the<br>
needle movement mechanism 380 comprises a needle trigger 381, a trigger rack 384,<br>
a needle spring 386, a gear 387, a needle rack 388 having a needle receiver 390, and<br>
lastly, the needle 400. The needle trigger 381 is connected to the needle rack 384, as<br>
shown, by a cap screw 382 and a pin 384. Each of the gear racks 384, 388 includes a<br>
corresponding rack guide 385,389, which provides a low surface-area contact surface<br>
for ease of movement.<br>
[0127]	The needle spring 386 biases the needle in the non-deployed or<br>
resting state, as shown in FIG. 41. In operation, as the trigger rack 384 is translated<br>
toward the proximal end 312 of the device 310 along arrow N1 (to the right), the gear<br>
387 translates the needle rack 388 and needle toward the distal end 314 of the device<br>
310 along arrow N2 (to the left). When the needle 400 is translated toward the distal<br>
end 312, it moves through a needle channel 343 in the fixed jaw 340 and ultimately,<br>
curves upward, where it temporarily extends from the lower, fixed jaw 340 along<br>
arrow N3.<br>
[0128]	The needle spring 386 must provide sufficient spring force to<br>
automatically retract the needle 400 when the needle trigger 381 is released. And, the<br><br><br>
surgeon must overcome this spring force when he squeezes the needle trigger 381 to<br>
deploy the needle 400. It is desirable, therefore, to reduce the required spring force to<br>
minimize or even eliminate hand fatigue relating to repeated actuations. For this<br>
purpose, the preferred needle 400 is coated with a lubricious coating that makes it<br>
easier to slide the needle 400 back and forth in the device 310 and within the patient's<br>
tissue. This lubricious coating reduces the needle's coefficient of friction and thereby<br>
lowers the spring force needed to retract the needle 400. The use of a lubricious<br>
coating makes the suturing device 310 easier to use by reducing the required spring<br>
force by about 20%. The preferred coating is a cured polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)<br>
coating, but any other fluoropolymer or ultra-low sheer solid would suffice. The needle<br>
400 may be coated by simply dipping it into a container of PTFE particles that have<br>
been suspended in a suitable solvent (the solvent flashing off after the needle is<br>
removed from the suspension and leaving behind the PTFE coating). Preferably,<br>
however, the needle 400 is heat cured after being coated in order to melt the PTFE to<br>
itself and form a more abrasion resistant coating.<br>
[0129]	FIGS. 42-48 collectively focus on the unique construction of the<br>
suture loading and deployment arrangement as embodied in the novel suturing<br>
apparatus' lower jaw 340. As shown throughout FIGS. 42-48, the lower or fixed jaw<br>
340 is located at a distal end of the elongated shaft 330. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, the fixed jaw 340 is formed from a lower jaw body 341 that is integrally<br>
formed from the same stock as the elongate shaft 330, in combination with a jaw<br>
insert 342 that is generally shaped like a ski tip. During assembly, the jaw insert 342 is<br><br><br>
dropped into and secured to the lower jaw body 341 in any suitable manner, e.g.<br>
welding.<br>
[0130]	The jaw insert 342 helps define a needle channel 343 which guides<br>
the needle 400 forward and then up and out during deployment. In particular, as best<br>
understood by viewing FIG. 43, and then FIGS. 44 and 48, the jaw insert 342 ultimately<br>
rests on and spans a pair of ledges 349 (only one is visible) that surrounds the floor<br>
and side walls of the needle channel 343 already formed in the lower jaw body. In<br>
essence, the bottom of the jaw insert 342 serves as the ceiling of the needle channel<br>
343. As explained in more detail below, the needle 400 (not shown in FIGS. 42-48) is<br>
translated horizontally through the needle channel 343 which includes a curve that<br>
directs the needle upward toward and ultimately out of channel exit 344.<br>
[0131]	FIGS. 42-48 also illustrate a unique construction that relates to the<br>
initial loading of the suture (not shown). In particular, the lower jaw 340 has a forked<br>
distal end 345 that includes a suture loading ingress provided as an end slot 346 that<br>
leads to a suture slot 347 contained in both the lower jaw body 341 and jaw insert 342.<br>
The suture slot 347 proximally terminates at a proximal suture retention node or slot<br>
end 348 where the suture resides, as further detailed below, prior to deployment when<br>
the suture is picked up by the needle and a loop of the suture is passed through the<br>
tissue held between the jaws..<br>
[0132]	In this embodiment, as best shown in FIGS. 44 and 46, the suture<br>
slot 37 has varying dimensions along its length in order to provide friction within<br>
portions of the slot relative to the suture to be deployed. As such, these dimensions<br><br><br>
vary relative to the suture to be passed by the device 310. The presently preferred<br>
device is intended for use with a range of suture, from #2 suture to #2-0 suture. The<br>
thicker #2 suture has a nominal diameter of about .5mm, or about .0196", and the<br>
thinner #2-0 suture has a nominal diameter of about .3mm, or about .0118". All further<br>
dimensions will be in inches. While this embodiment can accommodate a particular<br>
range of suture sizes, e.g., #2 to #2-0 suture, the dimensions can be adjusted as<br>
needed to accommodate any conventional suture size or range of conventional suture<br>
sizes.<br>
[0133]	Although this is an exemplary embodiment and the principals of the<br>
underlying invention can be varied to accommodate different size suture, a detailed<br>
review of this embodiment's dimensions may be helpful to the reader. At location "a"<br>
near the suture loading ingress or end slot 346, the width is much larger than the<br>
diameter of the suture so that the suture is easily pulled into the end slot 346 and<br>
down into the suture slot 347. At location "b" which extends on either side of the<br>
vertical portion of needle channel 343, the width is .024 + 001 such that the #2 suture<br>
may continue to pass freely through this portion of the suture channel 347. At location<br>
"c," the width of the suture channel 347 narrows to .020 + 001 such that the channel<br>
begins to closely conform to the suture's nominal diameter. At locations labeled "d,"<br>
the suture channel 347 narrows further to .019 + 001 such that there is a friction fit<br>
between the channel 347 and the suture. And finally, when the suture is pulled allows<br>
to the end of the suture channel 347 and into its proximal suture retention node 348,<br>
the width expands to .026 + 001, thereby allowing the surgeon to make vertical<br>
adjustments to the suture as desired prior to deployment to the surgical site.<br><br><br>
Generally, the surgeon will leave a relatively short tag of suture extending below the<br>
underside of the lower jaw 340 such that, after the device passes a loop of suture<br>
through the tissue, only that amount of suture need be pulled through the tissue by<br>
subsequently pulling on the loop before a single strand of suture remains. Moreover,<br>
after the device 310 is retracted from the surgical site, it is immediately ready to be<br>
reloaded with suture because the needle spring 386, shown in FIG. 41 and described<br>
above, automatically retracts the needle to the non-deployed or resting state and<br>
biases it in that position, whereby a new suture can be loaded.<br>
[0134]	FIGS. 49a and b to 56a and b are a succession of paired figures that<br>
illustrate some structural nuances and overall operation of the preferred embodiment.<br>
In particular, these figures show the overall operation - all the way from the loading of<br>
the suture through the suture loading ingress or end slot, the forward translation and<br>
momentary sideways movement of the needle as it engages the suture, the creation of<br>
a suture loop passed through the target tissue (the tissue has been omitted for clarity),<br>
and the retraction of the needle to the resting position.<br>
[0135]	Figures 49a and b show the position of the needle 400 relative to<br>
the suture slot 347 and proximal suture retention node 348 when the needle 400 is in<br>
the retracted or resting state.<br>
[0136]	FIGS. 50a and b show a length of suture 34 being initially pulled<br>
through the end slot 346 and down into the suture slot 347. Normally, the moveable<br>
jaw 350 would be closed prior to the loading of the suture 34, or at least prior to<br><br><br>
introduction of the device 310 to the surgical site, but here the moveable jaw 350 is<br>
consistently shown in the open position order to simplify the view.<br>
[0137]	FIGS. 51a and b show the suture 34 pulled a bit deeper into the<br>
suture slot 347. At this junction, in this particular embodiment, the suture 34 is being<br>
pulled into that part of the suture slot 347 that takes a non-linear path and that begins<br>
to narrow (see FIGS. 44 and 46 and related description). This geometry, or equivalent,<br>
provides sufficient friction to keep the suture in the suture slot 347 during deployment.<br>
[0138]	FIGS. 52a and b show the suture 34 at the point where it has been<br>
fully loaded into the proximal suture retention node 348 at the end of the suture slot<br>
347. In this embodiment, as can best be seen by looking back and forth between FIGS.<br>
51b and 52b, the non-linear geometry of the suture slot 347 also causes the needle tip<br>
404 to be laterally tucked off to the side of the suture slot 347 so that the suture 34<br>
does not hang up on the tip 404 when being pulled toward the proximal end of the<br>
suture slot 347. This arrangement beneficially prevents the suture 34 from being<br>
nicked as it is loaded. Also, as best shown in FIG. 52b, after the suture 34 is safely<br>
located proximally to the needle tip 404, the sideward or lateral deflection of the<br>
needle provides a subtle spring force that is directed to the right (upward in the figure).<br>
This squeezes the suture 34 between the needle's notch-side ramp 406 and the<br>
opposite of the proximal suture retention node 348, thereby helping retain the suture<br>
in place prior to placement without any further action by the surgeon. The foregoing<br>
arrangement constitutes a means for retaining the suture 34 within the suture slot 347<br>
prior to deployment. Other suitable structure may be used to accomplish this<br>
retention function, of course, including, but not limited to squeezing or pinching<br><br><br>
arrangements, friction based arrangements, a close relationship between the diameter<br>
of the suture and the dimensions of the suture slot, etc..<br>
[0139]	Continuing with the remaining FIGS. 53-56, please note that tissue<br>
would ordinarily be clamped between the lower jaw 340 and the moveable jaw 350<br>
prior to and during deployment of the needle 400 and placement of the suture 34. In<br>
other words, during needle deployment, the moveable jaw 350 would ordinarily be<br>
partially closed, as opposed to fully open as shown. However, in order to keep FIGS.<br>
53-56 similar to FIGS. 49-52 and clarify what is shown, the tissue is omitted and the<br>
moveable jaw 350 in shown in the fully open position.<br>
[0140]	FIGS. 53a and b show the position of the needle 400 relative to the<br>
lower jaw 340, suture slot 347, and suture 34, as the needle 400 is translated forward<br>
to the distal end of the device with the needle trigger 381 (see FIG. 41). As shown in<br>
FIG. 53b, the suture channel 343 (see also the side view in FIG. 48) includes a<br>
deflection relief 349 that permits the needle 400 to deflect to the left as it slides<br>
forward past the suture 34.<br>
[0141]	FIGS. 54a and b show the position of the various components after<br>
the needle 400 has been moved forward to the point that its needle notch 405 is<br>
aligned with the proximal suture retention node 348 and an intermediate portion of the<br>
suture 34 contained therein. By this point, a notch-side ramp 406 of the needle has<br>
cleared the suture 34 such that the needle 400 snaps back in line or springs back to<br>
the right and the intermediate portion of the suture 34 is surrounded by or captured in<br>
the needle notch 405.<br><br><br>
[0142]	FIGS. 55a and b shows the system after the needle 400 and needle<br>
notch 405 has been bent around the curve of the lower jaw's needle channel 343,<br>
thereby carrying a loop of the suture 34 out bf the needle exit 344 of the lower jaw<br>
340. If tissue were held between the lower and upper jaws 340, 350, then this loop of<br>
suture 343 would have been pushed or passed through that tissue.<br>
[0143]	FIGS. 56a and b, lastly, shows the needle 400 after it has<br>
automatically returned to its internal resting state within the needle channel 343 of<br>
the lower jaw 340. In this position, i.e. after passing the suture, the overall suture<br>
passing device 310 can be simply pulled proximally away from the surgical site, the<br>
loop of suture 340 sliding out of the end slot 346 at the distal end of the device 310.<br>
The jaws 340, 350 of the suture passing device 310, or a separate set of forceps, can<br>
then be used to pull the loop of suture 34 through the tissue. Note that the device 310,<br>
if desired by the surgeon, is automatically ready to load another length of suture 34<br>
into the end slot 346 for further suture passing activity.<br>
[0144]	In all embodiments, it is to be expressly understood that a<br>
disposable needle may be employed. It will be appreciated, therefore, that a system or<br>
kit is provided wherein the suturing apparatus (excluding the needle) may be re-used<br>
while the disposable needles are replaced.<br>
[0145]	Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Therefore, it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth<br>
