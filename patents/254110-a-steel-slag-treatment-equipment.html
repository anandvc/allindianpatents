				<td>A Steel Slag Treatment Equipment by Barrel Method<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an equipment for treating metallurgical molten slag in hot state.<br>
Background Art<br>
The existing metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method is one of currently advanced slag treatment equipments. It has advantages of short flow path, less investment, safety, reliability and low energy consumption, the slag, after having been treated, can be utilized directly, and the pollution is low. The metallurgical slag treatment technology and equipment by barrel method, in particular, a vertical feed double cavity barrel equipment can overcome the inadequacy of traditional slag treatment process and equipments, it has the advantages of short flow path, less investment, convenient operation, low energy consumption and good quality of treated product slag. A prior art patent CN 1141401 C discloses "A Steel Slag Treatment Equipment by Double Cavity Barrel method" for treating steel slag. Please refer to Fig.l, the equipment has two oppositely open squirrel-cage type barrel bodies consisting of backing rings 16, grid sections 31 and rotary end covers, wherein the grid sections and backing rings are connected together with bolts. Between the open sides of the two barrel bodies there is disposed a flow branching pan 9 capable of synchronously rotating, which divides the two barrel bodies into two relatively independent cavity bodies. The force moment causing the rotation of flow branching pans comes from a mandrel 6. The lower part of flow branching pan is a stationery retaining ring 12 of semi-ring shape having the function of separating the two cavity body and preventing the leakage of slag material 7 and cooling media 8. Below the barrel body is a discharge funnel 13 for discharging pulverized slag. Below the four backing rings are disposed eight sets of supporting roller devices 15 arranged respectively at a certain definite angle supporting the rotating parts of the equipment. A fixed hood 14 having a sealing function is located outside the rotary barrel body. During operation, steel slag is fed into funnel 1, falls onto the flow branching pan 9, and is guided respectively into two barrel bodies, after being cooled and crushed, by cooling body 8 (steel balls) leaks out through the slits between the grid sections, and is discharged out of the<br>
equipment through discharge funnel 13. The vapor generated in the process is collected by the fixed hood and discharged through specially provided shell and flue. The equipment uses vertical slag feeding, thus solving the problem of feeding slag of high viscosity relatively perfectly. But its disadvantages are, the barrel is a single layer barrel body construction, thus the cooling of slag material is not sufficient and red slag tends to appear; there are relatively too many supporting devices and the equipment is heavy; its lower space is limited, thus maintenance and repair are inconvenient.<br>
In addition, in the existing double cavity type metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method, the retaining ring is located at the lower part of the rotating flow branching pan within the barrel body. The retaining ring comprises a base plate and side plates on which there are many concave pits. The base plate and side plates form a V-shaped cell, in which slag material and many steel balls are filled. Through the base plate there is drilled a discharge hole. Although such a construction protects the retaining ring, the resistance during rotation of barrel body is large and further affects the operation of barrel body and the service life of the retaining ring.<br>
Further as is shown in Fig.8 and 9, the existing metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method uses a barrel body in the shape of a circular table, its cone portion is outside an inner barrel body and on its cylindrical portion there are many sending plates uniformly distributed peripherally. The sending plates have an inclination angle a with respect to the radial direction. The slag material after being treated in the inner barrel body falls by gravity to the inside of the conical surface of the outer barrel body and is guided on the inclined surface of the conical body into the cylindrical barrel portion , and under the action of sending plates is sent into a discharge chute and through it out of the equipment. This barrel body suffers the disadvantages that it must have a conical shape of inclination angle a in order to discharge slag material, the value of a being equal to the rest (repose) angle of slag material, generally 45 Â°. In this way the slag material coming down from the inner barrel body can be sent axially to the lower part of the discharge chute. According to the geometrical relationship of the construction, the diameter of the outer barrel body equals to the diameter of the inner barrel body plus twice the process width of inner barrel body, as a result, the outer diameter of barrel body is very large, the weight is large and investment is high.<br>
In addition, referring to Fig 12 and 13, the process of the existing metallurgical slag treatment by barrel method is such, through a slag feed inlet slag material enters the rotating inner barrel body, which is a squirrel-cage shape barrel body formed by many grid sections, at two ends of which are two end covers, under the inertia the slag material is thrown onto the surface of cooling media (steel balls), then penetrates by gravity into the slits between steel balls to be cooled and crushed, discharged through the grid sections at the bottom of inner barrel body into the outer barrel body. Generally, with the rotation of inner barrel body only the balls and slag material on the upper surface layer and those near the inner barrel body (lower surface layer) will move along the trajectories shown by arrows in Fig 13 under the action of frictional and gravitational forces, the steel balls in the middle kidney-shaped portion are far away from the inner barrel body, and are thus subjected to less frictional force by the surrounding steel balls, the motion region of which is smaller, even stationery and undergoes no normal heat exchange. As the hot slag material penetrates downward, the temperature of steel balls in this region increases rapidly and can not be cooled timely, that is, loses the normal effect of heat transfer, especially when the viscosity of hot slag material is high and thus the ability of slag material to penetrate into the slits between steel balls is weak, a large part of slag material will cover the upper surface of steel balls region of kidney shape and form " slag crust", where the contact area between slag material and steel balls is small, the steel balls taking part in cooling the slag material are those steel balls at the upper surface layer of balls in the kidney-shaped region, and, therefore, their cooling effect is low, tending to give rise to bursting in the barrel body, and the pulverizing effect is bad, tending to result in the discharge of red slag out of the equipment, not only affecting the service life of subsequent equipments, but also yielding product slag of low performance negating its direct utilization.<br>
Summary of The Invention<br>
The abject of the invention is to provide a double cavity type steel slag treatment equipment by barrel method with mandrel support to reduce weight and cost of equipment and at the same time to increase the space for maintenance and repair of the lower part.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a double cavity type steel slag treatment equipment by barrel method with mandrel support which can increase the<br>
cooling time of slag material in the equipment and thus improve the cooling effect, resulting in improving the product slag performance.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a retaining ring for a double cavity type steel slag treatment equipment by barrel method. The retaining ring overcomes the drawback that the existing retaining ring construction affects the rotation of barrel body, while the side plates of the retaining ring of the invention have smooth surface offering less frictional resistance to the motion of cooling media and slag material and thus less affecting the rotation of barrel body. The service life of the retaining ring of the invention is long, and the construction of the retaining ring is simple and its cost is low.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a barrel body for the rotation of barrel body, which overcomes the drawback that the existing barrel is large and its investment is high. The barrel body of the invention employs spiral sending plates, making the barrel body have the ability of transporting slag material in axial direction , decreasing the diameter of the barrel body, and reducing the equipment in vestment.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide sending hands for a double cavity metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method, which overcomes the drawback that the contact between the highly viscous molten slag and steel balls in existing inner barrel body is small, causing the molten slag in the barrel body of the invention to be sufficiently cooled and crushed.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a double cavity metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method with a mandrel support, comprising left and right barrel bodies, flow branching pans, a mandrel and a feed funnel, wherein the pan is disposed between the left and right barrel bodies and opposed to the flow branching pan are the opening parts of the left and right barrel bodies; over the flow branching pans is disposed a feed funnel, while below the flow branching pan is disposed a retaining ring; the mandrel fixedly connects the left and right barrel bodies and the flow branching pans, wherein, outside the left and right barrel bodies at both ends of the mandrel supporting bearings are mounted.<br>
Preferably, the left and right barrel bodies have two portions, namely inner and outer portions. The inner barrel body consists of grid section, one end of grid section is fixed to the end cover of outer barrel body through the insertion opening formed by supporting rings, the other end of the grid section is joined with the<br>
supporting rings on the outer barrel body. The mandrel fixedly connects the outer barrel body. Outside the outer barrel body are mounted geared rings for transmitting force moment, the geared rings are fixedly connected with one end of the outer barrel body.<br>
Preferably, between the inner and outer barrel bodies are mounted spiral sending plates, which are fixed on the inner surface of outer barrel body. The axis of the spiral sending plates forms a certain definite angle (30Â°-55Â°) with the axis of the outer barrel body.<br>
Preferably, the said retaining ring has supporting ribbed plates radially arranged between the side plates of the left and right barrel bodies. There is a fixed hood at the periphery of the retaining ring. The retaining ring and fixed hood are fixed on the foundation.<br>
As compared with prior art, this invention adds supporting bearings at two ends of the mandrel while maintaining double barrel bodies and vertical feed, the weight of equipment is shared equally by two bearing seats. Further, this invention eliminates the use of supporting rollers and backing rings, greatly decreasing the weight and manufacturing cost of the equipment, and simplifies the lower construction, giving a large space for maintenance and repair. The whole construction of equipment is compact. Because of the use of mandrel support, the bearings can accomplish good axial orientation, solving the problem of axial scurry which troubles the barrel equipment.<br>
Further, at the periphery of inner barrel body an outer barrel body capable of synchronously rotating is added, and within the outer barrel body are provided spiral sending plates, the axis of which forms a certain definite angle with the axis of the barrel. The spiral sending plates causes a certain definite quantity of water to be present in the outer barrel body, intensifying the cooling effect of the outer barrel body. This increases the cooling time of slag material in the barrel body and ensures that the product slag be discharged at the set regions.<br>
At the same time, in order to prevent seizure of the retaining ring, the mother board at the lower part of the retaining ring is eliminated and the left and right side plates are supported by ribbed plates of radial shape, causing all the slag material that can enter the clearance between the retaining ring and flow branching pan to be rapidly and smoothly discharged, meanwhile effectively reducing the weight of equipment, the upper part of discharge funnel is fixedly connected with the fixed<br>
hood, its lower part is connected with the inlet of a slag material transport device. The invention can effectively ensure that the metallurgical slag of various states (liquid state, glass state, even solid state less 300 mm in size can smoothly enter the equipment; the slag material is cooled sufficiently, and the performance of product slag is stable, the weight of equipment is small and its cost is low; the space available for maintenance and repair is large.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a retaining ring for the double cavity type metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method, comprising a base plate, side plates and ribbed plates, the base plate being a circular strip plate for the most part, side plates being annular plates. The arrangement of side plates and the base plate is \- shaped, two side plates are mounted in parallel on the base plate at an inward distance from the side surface of the base plate, the distance being equal to the width of the base plate itself. At the inside of the side plate is mounted a ribbed plate.<br>
Preferably, the inward distance at which the side plate is mounted on the base plate is 50-150 cm; the mounting position of side plate is semi-ring in shape, high at the rear and low at the front.<br>
As compared with the prior art, the surface of the side plates of the invention is smooth, and the side plate is mounted at an inward distance from the side face of the base plate, this inward distance from the side face of the base plate is just for the cooling media (steel balls) to stick to the side plate, being motionless or slightly moving during rotation of the barrel body, and thus accomplishing the object that the side plate is less worn out and at the same time the rotation of barrel body is less affected. The retaining ring is of a semicircular ring construction and has a certain clearance with both the barrel body and the flow branching pan, in this way, playing a role of closing the slag material and process media and protecting the flow branching pan to prevent the direct wear of the surface of the flow branching pan by the action of the slag material and process media. This invention has features of long service life, low resistance to the rotation of barrel body, simple constriction and low cost.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a barrel body for a metallurgical slag treatment equipment by barrel method, within the barrel body is disposed an inner barrel body, on the inner surface of the barrel body there are spiral sending plates uniformly distributed along the inner surface of the barrel.<br>
The above-mentioned metallurgical slag treatment equipment uses a barrel body. The said sending plates have planar or spiral shaped surface.<br>
As compared with the prior art, the barrel body of the invention employs spiral sending plates in place of the conical face of the original barrel body, while securing normal discharge, it simplifies the circular table type barrel body, decreasing the diameter of barrel body, optimizing the equipment construction, reducing the weight of the equipment. The construction is simple and the manufacturing cost of the equipment is reduced.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, on the inner wall of the inner barrel body of the inner barrel there are mounted convex sending hands. Preferably, on the grid sections of the inner barrel there are sending hands, the cross-section of which being L-shaped or inverted H-shaped. The steel balls can fall down from the L-shaped or inverted H-shaped sending hands.<br>
Preferably, on the end cover of the said inner barrel body are mounted sending hands at the end of which is mounted a guide plate. The sending hands are radially arranged about the center of the end cover.<br>
As compared with the prior art, on the grid sections of the inner barrel body and the end cover of the present invention are mounted convex sending hands, which scoop up the steel balls near the surface of inner barrel body and throw the steel balls onto the fallen slag region according to the set direction and angle via the sending hands on the grid section and the guide plates of the sending hands on the end cover, striking, crushing and cooling intensively the slag piles or slag crusts produced by the highly viscous molten slag. Meanwhile, the steel balls and slag material near the grid sections and end cover are continuously carried off, the nearby steel balls are continuously supplied, resulting in the downward and sidewise movement of the steel balls and slag material in the original relatively "motionless" kidney shaped region (see the arrows in Fig. 14 and 16), and thus eliminating the kidney-shaped "dead zone", giving full play to the heat transfer function of all steel balls. The treatment method of the invention, therefore, has features of easy implementation, simple construction, low-cost and excellent effect.<br>

Between inner barrel body 3 and outer barrel body 2 are mounted sending plates 17 fixed on the inner surface of outer barrel body 2. The axis of sending plates 17 form an angle (35Â° - 55Â°) with the axis of outer barrel body. Between left and right barrel bodies there is disposed a flow branching pan 9 fixedly connected to mandrel 6. Mandrel 6 is supported by bearings 4 located at outer sides of the left and right barrel bodies. At one end of mandrel 6 a driving geared ring 5 is fixedly connected, which is located at the outer side of the outer barrel body 2. At the lower part of flow branching pan 9 is disposed a retaining ring 12, which forms a gap fit respectively with flow branching pan 9 and inner barrel body 3. Retaining ring 12 has supporting ribbed plates radially disposed between two side plates of left and right barrel bodies. The lower pant of retaining ring 12 is empty. Retaining ring 12 is directly fixed on the foundation. At the periphery of retaining ring 12 is disposed a fixed hood 14, which forms a gap fit with outer barrel body 2.<br>
