				<td>This invention relates to a data carrier with an optically variable structure having<br>
an embossed structure with raised areas and a first coating contrasting with the surface<br>
of the data carrier, the embossed structure and the coating being so combined that at<br>
least parts of the coating are completely visible upon perpendicular viewing but con-<br>
cealed upon oblique viewing so that a tilt effect arises upon alternate perpendicular<br>
and oblique viewing. The invention further relates to a method for producing such a<br>
data carrier.<br>
It has been known for some time to equip data carriers, such as bank notes, pa-<br>
pers of value, credit cards or ID cards or the like, with optically variable security ele-<br>
ments, in particular optically variable diffraction structures such as holograms. Protec-<br>
tion from forgery by holograms is based on the different optical impression of said<br>
holograms that occurs upon a change of viewing angle relative to trie hologram. Said<br>
optically variable impression cannot be rendered by copying machines since copying<br>
machines only render the appearance of the hologram from a certain viewing angle. A<br>
data carrier with such a hologram is known for example from EP 0 440 045 A2. This<br>
print proposes applying the hologram to the data carrier as a prefabricated element or<br>
as an embossing in a lacquer layer applied to the data carrier.<br>
However, there are other optically variable security elements that can be pro-<br>
vided on a data carrier. Thus, it is known for example from CA 1 019 012 to provide a<br>
bank note in a partial area of its surface with a parallel printed line pattern. To produce<br>
the optically variable effect, a line structure is additionally embossed into the data car-<br>
rier in the area of the printed line pattern so as to form flanks visible only at certain<br>
viewing angles. Selectively disposing the printed line pattern on like-oriented flanks of<br>
the embossed line structure causes the line pattern to be visible upon oblique viewing<br>
of the flanks provided with the lines. Upon oblique viewing of the rear side of the<br>
flanks the line pattern is not recognizable.<br>
The antiforgery effect of such embossed optically variable security elements can<br>
be improved further if additional visually recognizable effects are produced by selec-<br>
tively changing the line pattern or embossed structure. Examples of such additional<br>
effects are described in WO 97/17211 and WO 02/20280.<br>
The optically variable effect of the latter known security elements arises funda-<br>
mentally from the combination of a print with a blind embossing that is preferably<br>
produced by intaglio printing. Blind embossing has the disadvantage that it cannot be<br>
integrated into a colored intaglio image but can only be used as an isolated security<br>
feature. This is because a relatively great distance between the blind embossing areas<br>
and the ink-carrying areas is required to make sure that absolutely no ink gets into the<br>
blind embossing depressions when the intaglio printing plate is inked.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of proposing a data carrier with<br>
an optically variable security element of the abovementioned kind that can be inte-<br>
grated into a printed image.<br>
This problem is solved by the features of the independent claims. Developments<br>
are the subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that the optically variable effect of the se-<br>
curity element is retained if an ink-carrying embossing is used instead of the blind em-<br>
bossing. That is, the optically variable structure has at least in partial areas a second<br>
coating likewise contrasting with the data carrier surface and disposed congruent to the<br>
raised areas of the embossed structure. The second coating offers the advantage of sta-<br>
bilizing the embossed structure without an additional printing operation.<br>
Moreover, the inventive security element has the advantage that it can be inte-<br>
grated into an intaglio motif and thus into the representational and color design of the<br>
main motif.<br>
Intaglio printing is characterized in that linear depressions are provided in the<br>
printing plates to produce a printed image. Areal representations are also produced by<br>
closely adjacent engraved lines, the individual engraved lines normally being fractions<br>
of a millimeter wide.<br>
For the printing operation the engraved lines of the plate are filled with ink. Sur-<br>
plus ink is removed from the plate with the help of a wiping cylinder or doctor blade<br>
such that the engraved lines are filled with ink up to the edge. During the printing op-<br>
eration the data carrier to be printed, normally paper, is finally pressed onto the plate<br>
with high pressure by means of a pressure cylinder having an elastic surface. The data<br>
carrier is thereby pressed into the ink-filled engraved lines of the plate, thus coming in<br>
contact with the ink. When the data carrier is detached it pulls the ink out of the de-<br>
pressions of the engraved lines. The thus produced printed image has printed lines that<br>
vary in ink layer thickness depending on the depth of engraving. The data carrier is<br>
pressed into the depressions of the plate so strongly that it not only receives ink from<br>
the depressions but is also simultaneously embossed.<br>
When translucent inks are used in intaglio printing, light color tones are obtained<br>
if a white data carrier is printed with thin ink layers, and darker color tones if printed<br>
with thick ink layers. This effect can also be utilized within the scope of the invention<br>
to produce different color effects and increase the contrast of the tilt effect. Likewise,<br>
it is possible to combine translucent and nontranslucent inks.<br>
The inventive optically variable structure can therefore be integrated into the<br>
printing plate of an intaglio motif in a very simple way by providing the embossed<br>
structure likewise in the form of depressions in the plate. During the printing operation<br>
the depressions belonging to the embossed structure are filled with an ink having for<br>
example the same color as the intaglio motif to be printed. This ink layer, which is<br>
transferred to the data carrier with the embossing operation, forms the inventive sec-<br>
ond coating disposed congruent to the raised areas of the embossed structure.<br>
It is not necessary for the total embossed structure to be inked with this color.<br>
Only partial areas of the embossed structure can also be provided with a color. Alter-<br>
natively, it is also possible to provide the embossed structure with different colors or a<br>
color flow. Such a color flow can be produced via a color split whereby the printing<br>
plate is accordingly inked by means of single color stencils. Preferably, the color of the<br>
second coating is integrated into the color design of the intaglio motif.<br>
The color split and a corresponding choice of printing inks employed are used se-<br>
lectively here to control the contrast of the optically variable structure.<br>
The color split can also be used to make parts of the optically variable structure<br>
machine-readable by adding at least one feature substance, such as a luminescent sub-<br>
stance, magnetic substance or electrically conductive substance, to at least one of the<br>
inks. Different parts of the optically variable structure can also be provided with dif-<br>
ferent feature substances. Alternatively, the total optically variable structure can also<br>
be equipped with a uniform machine-readable property.<br>
The optically variable structure can be directly adjacent to the intaglio motif or<br>
else be part of the steel intaglio motif.<br>
Since such intaglio motifs are primarily applied in security printing, the inventive<br>
data carrier is preferably a paper of value, in particular a bank note. The paper of value<br>
can be a security paper made of cotton fibers, a paper containing synthetic fibers<br>
and/or chemical pulp, or consist of pure plastic foils. Such a paper of value can also be<br>
used advantageously for protecting any products and goods.<br>
The second coating disposed in the area of the embossed structure can moreover<br>
have a color contrasting with the first coating and be disposed at least in partial over-<br>
lap with the first coating. Further, one of the coatings can have machine-readable<br>
properties at least in certain areas. These may be for example magnetic, electrically<br>
conductive or luminescent properties. Finally, the data carrier can have a metallic<br>
background layer in the area of the optically variable structure.<br>
The embossed structure is preferably executed as a screen structure. It can be tri-<br>
angular, but also trapezoidal, sinusoidal, semicircular or another shape. Preferably, the<br>
embossed structure is executed as a line screen with a constant screen ruling. In some<br>
embodiments, however, it can also be expedient to use different screen rulings. For<br>
example, the screen ruling can increase continuously in the edge area of the optically<br>
variable structure so that the embossed structure quasi tapers out. The same effect can<br>
be obtained by a continuous reduction of line width with constant or increasing screen<br>
ruling. In this edge area the first coating can be adapted in accordance with the em-<br>
bossed structure or be completely lacking.<br>
Further effects can be obtained if the flank angles vary within a line of the em-<br>
bossed structure executed as a line screen.<br>
To better bring out the optically variable effects, the embossed structure can be<br>
subdivided into partial areas where different partial embossed structures are provided,<br>
as described in WO 02/20280. The disclosure of this print is incorporated in the pres-<br>
ent invention by reference.<br>
The partial areas preferably form a two-dimensional matrix having m partial ar-<br>
eas in the horizontal direction and n partial areas in the vertical direction, where m, n =<br>
1, preferably m,n = 2. The partial embossed structures in at least two adjoining partial<br>
areas are disposed mutually offset by a fraction, in particular one third, of the screen<br>
ruling.<br>
The first coating is preferably a print likewise formed as a screen structure,<br>
whereby the individual screen elements can be designed at will. However, a line<br>
screen, with a constant screen ruling is preferably used. According to a preferred em-<br>
bodiment, said line screen consists of printed lines of any desired color design. The<br>
print is done by any desired printing process, such as offset or screen printing. Any<br>
desired indirect printing processes, such as indirect letterpress, can also be applied.<br>
The methods moreover make it possible to provide the first coating with a color flow,<br>
a so-called "rainbow blend."<br>
Printed screen and embossed structure are adjusted to each other, preferably such<br>
that the width of the printed screen lines is somewhat smaller than the length of the<br>
flanks of the embossed structure lines and that they extend parallel or largely parallel.<br>
Printed screen and embossed structure need not necessarily extend in a straight line,<br>
they can instead also be designed in the form of wavy lines, etc. The line widths are<br>
between 25 microns and 300 microns, preferably between 55 microns and 150 mi-<br>
crons. If the line screen is composed of printed, spaced-apart lines, a ratio of about 1 :1<br>
is preferably selected for the ratio of printed to unprinted areas. If a line width in the<br>
order of magnitude of about 100 microns is additionally selected, the lines can virtu-<br>
ally no longer be resolved by the eye and a homogeneous color effect arises. That is,<br>
the line screen is visually perceived only as a homogeneous colored surface. Addition-<br>
ally, the lines can be executed thicker in certain areas and thus represent for example a<br>
halftone image or another motif. Preferably, the lines only have thickened areas on one<br>
side. This likewise leads to stronger contrast. Alternatively, the lines can have gaps.to<br>
produce an additional visually recognizable pattern. The first coating and/or the em-<br>
bossed structure can also be executed so as to repeat the content of other information<br>
present on the document of value to make comparison possible.<br>
Quite generally it is to be underlined that the color design of the security element<br>
can be adjusted at will by a corresponding color choice of first and second coatings,<br>
since the mixture of the two colors is always perceived at least in a top view. Likewise,<br>
the information perceptible from different viewing angles can be adjusted by a corre-<br>
sponding choice of parameters, such as color, line thickness and line modulation of the<br>
first coating and flank angle, flank height and flank modulation of the embossed struc-<br>
ture.<br>
Rasterization of the print can be dispensed with if optically variable inks are<br>
used, i.e. inks having different optical effects dependent on the angle of vision. These<br>
may be high-gloss, e.g. metallic, layers or else inks that change their color effect them-<br>
selves in angle-dependent fashion, as is the case for example with liquid crystal pig-<br>
ment inks.<br>
However, an inventive optically variable structure with a rasterized first coating<br>
can also be additionally underlaid or covered with an optically variable printed image.<br>
This is preferably done with printing inks having interference layer and/or liquid crys-<br>
tal pigments. An additional metallic background is also conceivable. The printed im-<br>
age can be executed to be positive or negative. The use of liquid crystals additionally<br>
provides elevated protection from forgery since the printed image in this case has<br>
light-polarizing properties that can be read by machine. This holds in particular when<br>
the printed image is composed of partial printed images, with liquid crystals having<br>
different polarization properties being used for the partial printed images.<br>
The inventive optically variable structure can be underlaid or covered, not with<br>
an additional printed image, but with a foil element, such as a diffraction structure em-<br>
bossed into a lacquer layer. Here, any desired layer structures and types of foil ele-<br>
ments can be used, such as real holograms, lattice structures, volume holograms that<br>
are executed to be transparent, semitransparent or opaque.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the inventive optically variable structure<br>
consists of a print in the form of a printed line screen, a first color and an embossed<br>
structure superimposed on said line screen and likewise executed in linear fashion<br>
whose raised areas are provided with a further color contrasting with said first color.<br>
Said second color is preferably produced by means of translucent printing inks that<br>
have a certain transparency so that the color of the first coating shines through said<br>
color and the viewer thus perceives a mixed color in the superimposed areas. Espe-<br>
cially good effects are achieved if there is a complementary contrast between the first<br>
and second colors.<br>
When viewing said optically variable structure perpendicular to the data carrier<br>
surface, the viewer ideally recognizes only a uniform color effect. When the data car-<br>
rier is tilted or the viewing angle changed, parts of the first and/or second coating are<br>
concealed by the embossed structure, so that in certain areas the color effect of the first<br>
or second coating or of the mixed color of the two coatings predominates and thus<br>
variable color effects arise.<br>
This interplay of colors appears all the more clearly the better-contrasting the<br>
colors of the two coatings are. For example, a dark, e.g. black, line screen can be com-<br>
bined with a well-contrasting colored intaglio print with translucent inks, such as yel-<br>
low or other light color tones. The first coating in the form of a black line screen is<br>
preferably printed on here by the offset process.<br>
Alternatively, a further preferably all-over ink layer can be disposed under the<br>
first preferably screenlike coating. Said layer serves to stabilize the paper in the area of<br>
the security element and permits sharper edges in the area of the embossed structure.<br>
Said layer can be executed as a primer or colored lacquer layer or else contribute addi-<br>
tionally to the color design of the security element if said layer has a color contrasting<br>
with the first coating. One can use conventional printing inks or else special-effect<br>
inks, such as luminescent inks or printing inks containing interference or liquid crystal<br>
pigments.<br>
Finally, additional information can also be incorporated by designing the em-<br>
bossed structure and/or first coating accordingly. For example, the raised areas of the<br>
embossed structure can have different heights. If the embossed structure is produced<br>
by intaglio printing, this means that the engraving depths for the embossed structure<br>
are selected differently. The areas of lower engraving depth are filled with less ink in<br>
the printing or embossing operation and produce areas with a lighter color tone if<br>
translucent inks are used. In this way the inventive second coating can be used to pro-<br>
duce additional information visually recognizable at all viewing angles. Due to the<br>
different embossing heights, however, a change of viewing angle yields additional op-<br>
tically variable effects that are caused by the relative position of the first and second<br>
coatings as well as the embossed structure and the interplay thereof.<br>
The additional information can also be emphasized by an unembossed edge con-<br>
tour, as already described in WO 02/20280. Alternatively, the edge contour can also be<br>
provided with the second coating and the embossed structure according to the inven-<br>
tion.<br>
As mentioned above several times, the inventive optically variable security ele-<br>
ment is preferably produced in two printing operations. In a first printing operation,<br>
preferably by the offset process or an indirect printing process, the first coating is<br>
printed on the data carrier. In the second printing operation, which is preferably done<br>
by intaglio according to the invention, the embossed structure and the second coating<br>
are finally transferred to the data carrier simultaneously.<br>
Similar optical effects can be achieved if the two coatings are printed on in regis-<br>
ter to each other by offset and/or screen printing and this printed area is then provided<br>
with a blind embossing likewise in register. All embodiments described within the<br>
scope of the invention can be produced in this way. According to a special embodi-<br>
ment, for example, a line screen in a first color can be applied and at least partly in<br>
overlap therewith a second coating of translucent inks all over. In a last step, the total<br>
printed area is provided with a blind embossing in the form of a line screen in register.<br>
However, it is also possible to use the reverse order, providing first the embossed<br>
structure and second coating on the data carrier and then the first coating.<br>
Further embodiments and advantages of the invention will be explained with ref-<br>
erence to the figures, in which:<br>

the embossed structure is present in the form of a matrix,<br>
Fig. 11 shows a special embodiment of the embossed structure of the inventive<br>
security element.<br>
Fig. 1 shows inventive data carrier 1 with optically variable structure 2. Optically<br>
variable structure 2 is a security feature that can be checked without aids and is used<br>
optionally alongside further security features for checking the authenticity of the data<br>
carrier. The further security features may be for example a security thread, watermark<br>
or the like. As preferred within the scope of the invention, optically variable structure<br>
2 is disposed in the area of intaglio motif 3 of document of value 1. The geometrical<br>
and color design of optically variable security element 2 can be adapted to intaglio<br>
motif 3. Depending on the execution of intaglio motif 3, optically variable structure 2<br>
can also be integrated completely into said intaglio motif.<br>
However, the inventive security element can alternatively be disposed at any<br>
other place on document of value 1.<br>
It is especially advantageous to use inventive optically variable structure 2 in<br>
bank notes, as well as other papers of value such as shares, checks or the like. Labels<br>
or other elements for product protection can also be provided with such an optically<br>
variable structure.<br>
Optically variable structure 2 consists according to the shown embodiment of a<br>
first coating in the form of a print contrasting with the surface of the data carrier as<br>
well as an embossed structure and a second coating that likewise contrasts in color<br>
with the data carrier surface and is disposed congruent to the raised areas of the em-<br>
bossed structure. The various elements of optically variable structure 2 are combined<br>
with each other such that at least partial areas of the first coating are completely visible<br>
upon perpendicular viewing but concealed upon oblique viewing.<br>
This principle is made clear by the section along A-A shown in Fig. 2. First<br>
coating 4 consists of line screen 4, in the case shown here, and embossed structure 5 is<br>
also designed in the form of a line screen structure. Second ink layer 6 is disposed<br>
congruent to embossed structure 5, thus completely covering first coating 4. Upon per-<br>
pendicular viewing from viewing direction A, the viewer ideally recognizes only a<br>
colored surface whose color largely corresponds to the mixed color of first coating 4<br>
and second coating 6. Upon oblique viewing from viewing direction B, the viewer is<br>
faced by the flank of embossed structure 5 that coincides with the printed lines of<br>
printed screen 4. The viewer therefore perceives from viewing direction B an almost<br>
uniform colored print in the color of the mixed color from first coating 4 and second<br>
coating 6. In viewing direction C the viewer is faced by the flanks of embossed struc-<br>
ture 5 that coincide with the particular gap of line screen 4, so that from this direction<br>
the viewer perceives a likewise uniformly colored surface in the color of second coat-<br>
ing 6.<br>
Embossed structure 5 and second coating 6 are preferably transferred to docu-<br>
ment of value 1 by the intaglio printing plate. This has the advantage that the security<br>
element can be produced simultaneously with intaglio motif 3 in one operation. For<br>
this purpose, both the negative of desired embossed structure 5 and the intaglio motif<br>
are engraved into the printing plate. During the printing operation the printing plate is<br>
filled with ink and then data carrier material 1 is pressed into the engraved areas of the<br>
plate and lastingly deformed. The high contact pressure causes embossing 5 to also be<br>
noticeable on the back of data carrier material 1.<br>
The printing plate can be inked with a uniform color for the printing operation so<br>
that second coating 6 and intaglio motif 3 have the same color. Different colors can<br>
also be used, however.<br>
Since translucent inks are preferably used for second coating 6, the viewer can<br>
recognize the mixed color of the two colors in the overlap area between first and sec-<br>
ond coatings 4, 6.<br>
Embossed structure 5 shown in Fig. 2 consists of directly adjoining triangular<br>
profiles when viewed in cross section. However, the triangular profiles can also be<br>
slightly spaced apart. The relative position of first coating 4 and second coating 6 or<br>
embossed structure 5 can also vary, as made clear by Figs. 3 to 5. Here, only the em-<br>
bossed profile and the relative position of coatings 4, 6 are shown.<br>
In Fig. 3 the triangular profiles of embossed structure 5 are spaced apart, which is<br>
indicated by connection bars 7. First coating 4 is disposed on one of the flanks of em-<br>
bossed structure 5 below second coating 6, as shown in Fig. 2. Connection bars 7 are<br>
coating-free, however, so that the data carrier surface is visible in this area.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a variant in which first coating 4 completely covers connection bars<br>
7 and part of the flanks of embossed structure 5. In this example, second coating 6<br>
covers first coating 4 only partly, so that first coating 4 is also visible in partial areas.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further embodiment in which the relative position of embossed<br>
structure 5, first coating 4 and second coating 6 corresponds to the embodiment al-<br>
ready shown in Fig. 3. However, the raised areas of embossed structure 5 have differ-<br>
ent heights in this example. If embossed structure 5 and coating 6 are produced by ink-<br>
carrying intaglio printing, this means that more ink is transferred in the areas of the<br>
embossed structure with the higher raised areas. Due to the higher ink layer thickness<br>
in area 8 of embossing 5, partial areas 8 of embossing 5 appear in a darker color tone<br>
than partial areas 9 of embossing 5. In this way, additional information can be pro-<br>
duced in the optically variable element.<br>
However, such visually recognizable additional information can also be produced<br>
in other ways. If translucent printing inks are used, the additional information can also<br>
be represented by a higher ink layer thickness in certain areas of the printed image.<br>
Fig. 6 shows in cross section printing plate 30 for producing such additional in-<br>
formation. First printed image 31 is engraved into plate 30 with depth t1. Second<br>
printed image 32, which is superimposed on first printed image 31, is engraved into<br>
plate 30 with depth t2. Since the engraving for second printed image 32 is deeper than<br>
the engraving for first printed image 31, more ink is transferred in the area of printed<br>
image 32. When translucent printing inks are used, a darker color effect therefore re-<br>
sults in the area of printed image 32, and printed image 32 is recognizable against<br>
lighter printed image 31. According to this example, the two printed images 31, 32<br>
form the second coating that is transferred to the document of value simultaneously<br>
with the embossed structure in the printing operation.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further variant for producing additional information in the second<br>
coating. It again shows printing plate 30, into which a line with width b is milled. Said<br>
line is composed of different areas 33, 34 that differ in their depth and flank steepness.<br>
In the finished printed image said line shows different color effects along its length<br>
since the inking is different in areas 33, 34.<br>
If the line depth is too great, paper tears might occur during the embossing opera-<br>
tion. To therefore permit the same line width to be retained, it might therefore be nec-<br>
essary to make the line just as wide but less deep. If a milling tool is used for produc-<br>
ing the printing plate, it might therefore be necessary to produce the line by means of a<br>
narrower engraving tool that nevertheless produces the width of the desired engraved<br>
line by corresponding guidance of the milling tool.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further embodiment of the inventive optically variable structure.<br>
In this example, the first coating consists of two crosswise disposed line screens 10, 11<br>
that can also be designed in different colors. In the shown example, the lines of printed<br>
screen 11 are disposed on one of the flanks of embossed structure 5. This association<br>
emerges from the profile sketches at the lower edge of Fig. 8, which shows a detail of<br>
embossed structure 5 and coating 6 in cross section.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an embodiment of the inventive optically variable structure in<br>
which the first coating consists of one-sided screen 40. Said screen starts at straight<br>
baseline 41. Opposite line 42 of the screen element is of irregular design and can vary<br>
from screen element to screen element. This particular screen can be used to represent<br>
very well-contrasting halftone images. As explained above with reference to Fig. 8,<br>
said screen elements 40 preferably come to lie on the flanks of embossed structure 5<br>
and are covered by second coating 6.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a top view of the basic structure of inventive optically variable<br>
structure 2. It consists of the first coating in the form of line screen 4 with a constant<br>
screen ruling, the line screen consisting of spaced-apart printed lines. Embossed struc-<br>
ture 5 is disposed in overlap with print 4, being indicated only by the dash-lined frame<br>
for clarity's sake. Shown embossed structure 5 is subdivided into six partial areas 50,<br>
51, 52, 53, 54, 55 where partial embossed structures are disposed, being omitted from<br>
the drawing as mentioned above. The second coating, which is disposed congruent to<br>
the raised areas of the partial embossed structures, is not shown either. Partial areas 50,<br>
51, 52, 53, 54, 55 are directly adjacent here and form a two-dimensional matrix. De-<br>
pending on the embodiment, said matrix can have n partial areas in the vertical direc-<br>
tion and m partial areas in the horizontal direction, where n, m = 1, preferably n, m = 2.<br>
In the shown example, n = 3 and m = 2. A second coating, which is likewise omitted<br>
from the drawing, is disposed congruent to the raised areas of embossed structure 5 in<br>
this example as well.<br>
The relative position of the partial embossed structures and line screen 4 varies<br>
within embossed structure 5 from partial area to partial area, so that partial areas 50,<br>
51, 52, 53, 54, 55 differ in their color, color tone or brightness and are thus visually<br>
recognizable as contrasting partial areas. Upon a change of viewing angle, the color<br>
and light/dark impressions of the partial areas vary. This impression is strengthened by<br>
superimposed second coating 6.<br>
Fig. 11 schematically shows a further special embodiment of embossed structure<br>
5. It is composed of partial areas 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 where different partial em-<br>
bossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 are disposed. The sloping lines in Fig. 11 indi-<br>
cate the course and arrangement of particular partial embossed structure 20, 21, 22, 23,<br>
24, 25. The shown lines mark the valleys of the embossed structure, as is made clear<br>
by the sketch in the left area under embossed structure 5, which shows partial em-<br>
bossed structure 23 in cross section. For clarity's sake, the zeniths of partial embossed<br>
structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 have not been shown with lines in the figures.<br>
All partial embossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 have same screen ruling a.<br>
However, pairs of adjoining partial embossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 are mu-<br>
tually offset. In the shown example, the offset is preferably a fraction 1/x of screen<br>
ruling a. Preferably, a pair of adjacent partial embossed structures is mutually offset by<br>
one third of screen ruling a. The first coating has been omitted in Fig. 11 for clarity's<br>
sake. Since the arrangement of the partial embossed structures and congruently dis-<br>
posed second coating varies from partial area to partial area, however, the relative po-<br>
sition between the first coating and particular partial embossed screen 20, 21, 22, 23,<br>
24, 25 also varies accordingly. This produces frequently changing light/dark contrasts<br>
and changing color effects that visually stand out clearly and are well recognizable. If<br>
the offset is selected for example so that the partial embossed structures recur within<br>
embossed structure 5, a plurality of partial areas show the same appearance from one<br>
viewing angle. However, partial embossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 of inven-<br>
tive embossed structure 5 need not be fundamentally offset by a fraction of screen rul-<br>
ing a. Any other offset is equally conceivable. Also, not all partial embossed structures<br>
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 need be mutually offset. In some circumstances it is sufficient if<br>
only two of partial areas 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 are provided with mutually offset par-<br>
tial embossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. The latter also need not necessarily be<br>
directly adjacent. Likewise, single partial areas 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 can be provided<br>
with partial embossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 with different screen ruling a.<br>
The extending direction of single partial embossed structures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 can<br>
also vary with respect to the extending direction of adjacent partial embossed struc-<br>
tures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. For example, partial embossed structure 20 can be dis-<br>
posed at an angle of 90° to partial embossed structure 21.<br>
In the shown examples, the first coating was always applied first and then em-<br>
bossing 5 or second coating 6. Alternatively, it is of course also possible to first apply<br>
the embossed structure and the second coating and then print the first coating on the<br>
second coating.<br>
