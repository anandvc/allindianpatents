				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a sheath device for an endoscopic instrument, such as a catheter or cystoscope, which, said sheath when mounted onto any optical device, allows for the surgeon to examine or manipulate within an orifice or through a incision, whilst easily manipulating the endoscopic device. The device allows for delivery by means of an agent to the target organ or tissue at variable positions whilst maintaining a fixed position of the optical device or fluid inlet/outlet device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In medical practise, whether for purposes of examination or surgical procedures, the devices used in the practice must allow for the surgeon to easily interact with the patient's organs and cavities. Devices cumbersome to handle or manipulate may result in unsuccessful surgical procedures, misdiagnoses and, particularly in the case where the patient is not anaesthetised, great discomfort to the patient.<br>
UK 2 284 158 discloses an injection catheter consisting of an outer sheath and a needle means located in and axially movable with relation to the outer sheath. Thus, when performing multiple injections, retraction of the needle means and rotation of the outer sheath is required. Moreover, the device does not allow for visualisation during the medical procedure.<br>
WO 99/47069 discloses an instrument for guiding delivery of an injectable material for treating urinary incontinence. The device does not allow for variable positions of injection nor for visualisation during the medical procedure.<br>
US 5,020,514 discloses an endoscope for nasal surgery. Said endoscope comprises an outer shaft with a handle incorporating a switching valve for connecting/disconnecting a source of negative pressure and a source of a flushing fluid. A working insert, for insertion into the outer shaft, comprising a shaft for receiving an optical system, proximally connected to the working insert, a shaft for receiving an auxiliary instrument, and two guides for wires and rods, which are movable by means of handles.<br>
US 5,287,845 describes an endoscope for transurethral surgery, which has a main body irrotationally supporting an optic and a surgical instrument, an outer tube affixed to the main body and tubular enclosing the optics and the surgical instrument. The outer tube is rotational relative to the remaining endoscope parts.<br><br><br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of injecting a material into the human<br>
body comprising the use of the device of the invention. The invention further relates to a<br>
kit comprising the device and a material suitable for injection into the human body, such<br>
as a polymeric hydrogel comprising polyacrylamide.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a device for use in the examination or surgical<br>
treatment of a mammalian body, such as a human.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an endoscopic device that allows for the<br>
surgeon to manipulate the working element during operation and/or diagnosis while keep<br>
non-working elements immobile.<br>
Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide for a sheath of an endoscopic<br>
equipment which needs minimal sterilisation and is disposable.<br>
According to the invention, the above objectives is fulfilled by a sheath device suitable for<br>
endoscopic instruments, the device comprising:<br>
a) an elongated tubular member comprising:<br>
a proximal end,<br>
a distal open end, and<br>
at least one fluid channel extending longitudinally from said proximal end to a fluid<br>
exit; and<br>
b) a flushing unit connected to said proximal end of the tubular member and comprising:<br>
a proximal open end suitable for receiving a first endoscopic instrument,<br>
a fluid inlet being in contact with said fluid channel, and<br>
a fluid outlet,<br>
the tubular member and the flushing unit together define a first interior guiding<br>
passage extending longitudinally from the proximal open end of the flushing unit to the<br>
distal open end of the tubular member for sheathing at least a part of said first<br>
endoscopic instrument,<br>
and wherein the connection between the tubular member and the flushing unit allows for<br>
axial rotation of the tubular member in relation to the flushing unit.<br>
The term "internal organ" is intended to mean an organ, tissue or any cellular structure<br>
located inside the body cavity.<br>
The term "endoscopic instrument" is intended to mean any kind of scope for surgery or<br>
diagnosing of internal cavities of a human body.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the elongated tubular member and the flushing unit each<br>
comprises an interior guiding passage, which together defines said first interior passage,<br>
when the two elements are connected to each other. Thus, the first endoscopic instrument<br>
may be received through the proximal open end of the flushing unit and pushed into the<br>
guiding passage. The first endoscopic instrument may be a lens for viewing internal tissue<br>
or organs during operation or diagnosing, said instrument being coupled to a camera that<br>
may be connected to a television/screen.<br>
The tubular member sheaths at least the part of the endoscopic instrument to be<br>
positioned inside the body, and while sheathing said part, the open distal end of the<br>
tubular member is introduced e.g. through a cavity in the body into the tissue or organ.<br>
The sidewall of tubular member may have a smooth outer surface so as to expose the<br>
patient for as less pain as possible, when introducing it into the cavity, e.g. the urethra,<br>
vagina or rectum. Preferably, the cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction<br>
of the tubular member is substantially circular, but it may be substantially oval shaped.<br>
The entire tubular member or just be the part, which is to be introduced to the body, e.g.<br>
5-15 cm of the tubular member (measured from the distal end), may have a circular or an<br>
oval outer cross-section.<br>
The diameter of the tubular member may differ depending on the sort of endoscopy, such<br>
as from 3 mm and up to 15 mm. For treatment of incontinence, the diameter of the part,<br>
which is to be introduced through the urethra, is preferably 7-8 mm.<br>
Also the length of the tubular member may vary depending of the sort of endoscopy, so<br>
the length can be e.g. 5-30 cm, such as 10-25 cm, such as 15-20 cm.<br>
The flushing unit is arranged for providing a flush of water (or other fluids) through the<br>
fluid exit, which preferably is located near said distal end or in said distal end. The flush<br>
may be used for flushing e.g. removed tissue or bone parts out of the body during an<br>
operation, or for flushing e.g. the bladder when operating for incontinence. The fluid<br>
channel is preferably placed between said interior guiding passage and the sidewall of the<br>
tubular member, but it may be placed separately inside the interior guiding passage of the<br>
tubular member. The diameter of the outlet may be larger than the diameter of the inlet.<br>
In case the sheath device e.g. is used for treatment of anal incontinence, it is not needed<br>
to flush water into the rectum and therefore the flushing unit may be removed. Thus, the<br>
sheath device may in this case be rotationally connected directly to the endoscopic<br>
instrument.<br>
The fluid exit is preferably positioned in the distal open end, but alternatively it may<br>
comprise one or more holes provided in the sidewall near the distal open end of the<br>
tubular member, so that the water exits the tubular member in an angle in relation to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the tubular member.<br>
The tubular member and the flushing unit are preferably fixed (but still rotatable)<br>
connected to each other, but they may be detachable connected so that the two elements<br>
can be separated.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tubular member further comprises a<br>
second guiding passage extending substantially longitudinal from a location near the<br>
proximal end or from the proximal end to the distal end of the tubular member, the second<br>
passage being suitable for receiving and guiding a second endoscopic instrument.<br>
As the second guiding passage is positioned in the tubular member, it allows for rotation of<br>
the second endoscopic instrument in relation to the first endoscopic instrument and<br>
flushing unit. This is a major advantage during operation, as an endoscopic operation<br>
requires movement and rotation of one or more of the instruments positioned inside the<br>
body during the operation, and which can be complicated to control. As the second guiding<br>
passage can be rotated separately, the surgeon only needs to move the tubular member<br>
with the second instrument and not the flushing unit and first endoscopic instrument, when<br>
moving the second instrument e.g. from one tissue area to another. This provides an<br>
easier handling of the equipment and a less painful operation for the patient.<br>
In particular, the second guiding passage is useful when treating a patient for<br>
incontinence. This treatment comprises i.a. the step of injecting a bulking agent in<br>
different tissue areas of the urethra near the bladder neck. In that case, the first<br>
instrument may comprise a lens and second instrument may comprise a needle to be<br>
introduced to the tissue, the needle being guided into the second guiding passage upon<br>
introducing the tubular member into the bladder through the urethra. The needle is<br>
introduced to the tissue area and the bulking agent injected, and if the surgeon wants to<br>
inject agent in another tissue area, he/she, may just retract the needle from the tissue,<br>
rotating the tubular member without moving the lens and flushing unit, and introducing<br>
the needle in another tissue area. Thus, the surgeon can maintain the lens in the same<br>
orientation while moving the needle (by the tubular member) inside the body.<br>
The tubular member may be rotatable within an angle range of 0° to 360° in relation to<br>
said flushing unit, such as 45° or 90°. The connection between the tubular member and the<br>
flushing unit may comprise indicating means for indicating the axially angular rotation<br>
between the tubular member and the flushing unit + the first instrument.<br>
Preferably, the second guiding passage comprises an inlet in its end closest to said<br>
proximal end of the tubular member, the inlet being arranged in an outer surface of said<br>
tubular member. The inlet may be substantially conical shaped so as to provide a better<br>
guidance of said second instrument into the passage. The inlet may comprise a penetrable<br>
sealing to be penetrated by the instrument. Preferably, inlet may comprise the conical<br>
shaped inlet made of rubber.<br>
In order to improve the bending moment of the tubular member and thus prevent a<br>
breakage of the member, it may comprise reinforcement ribs extending on the outer<br>
surface of the tubular member from its proximal end and along at least a part of the<br>
tubular member towards the distal end. The inlet of the second guiding passage may be<br>
incorporated in one of the reinforcement ribs.<br>
The second endoscopic instrument may comprise a needle, such as a needle for injecting<br>
bulking agent or another medical, the needle being flexible over a substantial portion of its<br>
length. The needle may be an ablation needle having cutting edge(s) for ablating and/or<br>
penetrating tissue.<br>
Alternatively, the second instrument may comprise a fibre optic probe for operation of<br>
internal tissue.<br>
Preferably, the sheath device may be disposable (onetime use) in order to provide a<br>
surgical equipment that requires as less sterilisation time as possible. Also the flushing unit<br>
may be disposable, in particular if the tubular member and the unit is fixed connected to<br>
each other.<br>
In order to prevent reuse of the disposable sheath device and the flushing unit, a rubber<br>
sealing may be provided e.g. between the flushing unit and the tubular member, the<br>
rubber sealing being destroyed when exposing the sheath device to a sterilisation process<br>
e.g. in an autoclave.<br>
The flushing unit is provided for the purpose of flushing water into the internal organ of the<br>
body so as to flush out removed tissue or bone parts. The fluid inlet may be connected to a<br>
water reservoir via a flexible tube for flushing clean water through the fluid channel and<br>
out of said fluid exit into the organ. The outlet may also be connected via a flexible tube to<br>
another water reservoir for flushing filthy water away from the internal organ via said<br>
interior passage.<br>
The fluid outlet may be in contact with said open distal end of the tubular member via an<br>
interior passage extending longitudinally in said tubular member. Preferably, the interior<br>
passage is composed by the first guiding interior guiding passage of the tubular member,<br>
the diameter of which being larger than the diameter of the endoscopic instrument<br>
introduced therein. Thus, filthy water may flow into said distal open end, along the outer<br>
surface of the endoscopic instrument and out through the outlet. Alternatively, the outlet<br>
may be in contact with the distal open end via a separate passage/fluid channel provided<br>
in the tubular member.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the flushing unit comprises an inner tube and an outer tube<br>
surrounding the inner tube with a space therebetween. The inlet is connected to the space<br>
created between the outer and inner tube, and the outlet is connected to the space inside<br>
the inner tube. When assembling the flushing unit with tubular member, the inner tube will<br>
be connected to the first guiding passage, and the outer tube will be connected to the fluid<br>
channel(s). Thus, when e.g. flushing the bladder and/or urethra the fluid that exits the<br>
distal end of the tubular member will be flushed back into the first interior guiding passage<br>
without applying a suction in the first passage. This is a substantially faster process than<br>
for devices described in the prior art where flushing and suction are turned on separately.<br>
However, a suction may be provided in the first guiding passage so that the fluid is sucked<br>
out of the bladder and/or urethra.<br>
The first interior guiding passage of the flushing unit may be arranged coextendingly inside<br>
the inner tube, so that this passage is connected to the interior guiding passage of the<br>
tubular member when connecting the flushing unit thereto. Thus, the first interior guiding<br>
passage, extending longitudinally from the proximal open end of the flushing unit to the<br>
distal open end of the tubular member for sheathing at least a part of said first endoscopic<br>
instrument, is defined, cf. claim 1.<br>
The proximal open end of the flushing unit is suitable for receiving and guiding the first<br>
endoscopic instrument into said interior guiding passage. Sealing means may be provided<br>
in said proximal open end of the flushing unit to obtain a tight connection to the<br>
endoscopic instrument.<br>
The first and second guiding passages and the fluid channel preferably extends<br>
substantially parallel to each other. When seeing the tubular member in the cross-section<br>
perpendicular to its longitudinal direction, it may have a honeycomb-like cross-section,<br>
wherein the first guiding passage is provided in the middle (on the centre line of the<br>
tubular member) and the fluid channel(s), second guiding passage or more guiding<br>
passages are provided between the first guiding passage and the sidewall of the tubular<br>
member.<br>
Due to ease of production of the sheath device, the fluid channel and guiding passages<br>
may provided by a detachable wall member positioned inside the tubular member, and<br>
which is not moulded simultaneously with the tubular member, but inserted therein<br>
afterwards. The detachable wall member may, together with the sidewall of the tubular<br>
member, define said fluid channel(s) and passages.<br>
The tubular member may comprise two or three further longitudinal extending guiding<br>
passages for further endoscopic instruments.<br>
The distal end of the tubular member may comprise a circumferential inwardly extending<br>
bulge for guidance of a distal end of said second endoscopic instrument, in particular the<br>
abovementioned flexible needle. The bulge is useful in connection with the<br>
abovementioned treatment for incontinence, because the distal end of the needle can be<br>
bend, so as to provide an even better control of the needle tip. The bulge may bend the<br>
distal end of the needle such that it may emergence the tubular member at angle of 5-45°<br>
in relation to the centre line of the tubular member.<br>
Depending on the sort of endoscopic operation/diagnosing, the sheath device may be<br>
suitable for different kinds of endoscopic instrument. The instruments to be introduced to<br>
the first interior guiding passage may comprise a cystoscope or a gastroscope or an<br>
ureteroscope or a resectoscope or an arthroscope or a telescope or an obturator.<br>
The first endoscopic instrument may also comprise a camera lens e.g. for viewing internal<br>
tissue or organs. The lens is connected to a camera so that the surgeon can view the<br>
inside of the body on a screen. Due to the second guiding passage, the surgeon only has<br>
to look at the screen and not on the endoscopic equipment, as the passage guides e.g. the<br>
needle.<br>
The lens may be disposable (onetime use). A type of lens used for this purpose could be<br>
the sort of lenses used in the "night vision goggles" in the military. The disposable lens<br>
may be incorporated in the tubular member, so that the surgeon only has to connect the<br>
sheath device to the endoscopic instruments needed for the operation and connect the lens<br>
to a camera. After the operation, the sheath device with the lens incorporated is thrown<br>
away, and the sterilisation process is dispensed with.<br>
Preferably, the distal end of the tubular member exceeds a distal end of the lens, so that<br>
the surgeon, when introducing an instrument through the second guiding passage, may<br>
view the tip of the instrument on the screen, before the instrument is introduced into the<br>
tissue or organ.<br>
When treating for incontinence known methods and equipment require a visual survey<br>
meaning that the surgeon need to view an outflow of urine before knowing the right<br>
location to be treated in the bladder neck. As the sheath device according to the invention<br>
allows for use of both a camera lens and an injection needle at the same time, a visual<br>
survey is dispensed with, as the surgeon can find the right location to be treated on the<br>
television/screen.<br>
The sheath device may be made of an appropriate plastic material or a metal.<br>
A generally interesting aspect of the invention relates to a method of injecting a material<br>
into the human body comprising the use of the device of the invention.<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sheath device suitable for an endoscopic device, such as<br>
a catheter or cystoscope, which, said sheath when mounted onto any optical device, allows<br>
for the surgeon to examine or manipulate within an orifice or through a incision, whilst<br>

agent to the target organ or tissue at variable positions whilst maintaining a fixed position<br>
of the optical device or fluid inlet/outlet device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In medical practise, whether for purposes of examination or surgical procedures, the<br>
devices used in the practice must allow for the surgeon to easily interact with the patient's<br>
organs and cavities. Devices cumbersome to handle or manipulate may result in<br>
unsuccessful surgical procedures, misdiagnoses and, particularly in the case where the<br>
patient is not anaesthetised, great discomfort to the patient.<br>
UK 2 284 158 discloses an injection catheter consisting of an outer sheath and a needle<br>
means located in and axially movable with relation to the outer sheath. Thus, when<br>
colon (or canalis analis); and the ureter for the treatment of urinary incontinence, anal<br>
incontinence, and vesicouretal reflux, respectively; wherein said device is injectable and<br>
comprising the hydrogel as described herein.<br>
The method of the invention preferably includes the administering of the hydrogel by<br>
means of injecting the hydrogel into the appropriate conduit. In the treatment of urinary<br>
incontinence, the hydrogel is typically injected into the urethra, specifically under the<br>
submucosal membrane of the urethra. Injection is via the external surface of the urethra<br>
and toward the submucosal membrane.<br>
The present investigators have found that typically 2 to 5 mL of the hydrogel are suitable<br>
to provide adequate resistance in the urethra by bulking the urethra. Typically, 3 ml of<br>
hydrogel is injected and preferably the 2-5 mL are distributed by depositing the gel at<br>
more than one cross-sectional position along a single longitudinal position of the urethra.<br>
In a particularly suitable embodiment, 3 or more depots are made along a single<br>
longitudinal position of the urethra. The present investigators have found that depots 0.5<br>
cm distally from the neck of the bladder are particularly suitable.<br>
The present investigators have found that submucosal injections at positions 10, 2, and 6<br>
