				<td>This invention relates to a method of producing a dry gypsum-based composition containing special oleochemical additives and to the use of this composition for the production of gypsum components and for special building plasters, gypsum plasters and grouting compounds.<br>
By virtue of its ability to set with water, gypsum in the form of the anhydride or hemihydrate has long been a valued raw material with many interesting properties, for example minimal shrinkage, fire resistance and a neutral pH value during curing. Today, large quantities of gypsum are also formed in the desulfurization of waste gases and need to be put to an ecologically safe use.<br>
However, one disadvantage of set gypsum mortars, screeds and coatings is the relatively poor water resistance of these systems. The exterior use of gypsum, for example as a plaster, still remains an unsolved problem.<br>
It is already known that gypsum can be hydrophobicized by addition of special polysiloxanes in quantities of up to 2% by weight. However, this is a disadvantage insofar as the addition of polysiloxanes causes serious harm to the environment due to their biological non-degradability and their unfavorable ecobalance. In addition, correspondingly modified gypsums are not of sufficient quality for exterior applications.<br>
DE-OS 32 38 390 describes a ready-made mortar which contains gypsum or cement as binder and, in addition, a quantity of 0.5 to 1% by volume, based on the volume of the ready-made mortar, of a mixture of 60 to 88% of a C 10-20 paraffin hydrocarbon mixture and/or a glycerol ester, a higher fatty acid or a fat and 12 to 40% of a surfactant as emulsifier. The mixture in question has hydrophobicizing properties so that the mortar shows better heat-insulating properties and frost resistance.<br>
JP-A-82/61648 describes a dispersant for gypsum which contains a	<br><br>
condensate of an (alkyl) naphthalene sulfonic acid and formaldehyde, a silicon dioxide powder and optionally an oil selected from mineral oils, synthetic lubricating oils and natural oils. The gypsum disperses thoroughly in water until its sets by reacting with water. The separation of water from the mixture of gypsum and water, i.e. the gypsum suspension, is reduced during the setting process and the cured gypsum is obtained in a high quality.<br>
JP-A-73/73427 describes both fire-resistant and water-resistant plaster mortar walls containing cellulose ethers which are obtained by reacting a suspension of calcined gypsum together with a water-containing cellulose resin, asbestos or glass fibers in a mold in the presence of a metal salt of a higher fatty acid and applying heat to drive out the water.<br>
JP-A-79/10974 describes building boards with improved resistance to water which are obtained by adding a higher fatty acid or a salt thereof in a relatively large quantity to a hydraulic material, such as cement or calcined gypsum.<br>
Belgium patent application 873812 describes a solidified gypsum concrete which is obtained by thoroughly mixing gypsum and water, the gypsum being partly replaced by a substantially insoluble metal salt of a fatty acid. A calcium, aluminium, barium, lead, magnesium, zinc, copper or nickel salt of stearic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid or similar acids is used for hydrophobicization.<br>
JP-A-82/3751 describes water-resistant, set gypsum moldings which are obtained by reacting a hydrophobicizing agent with calcium oxide hemi-hydrate, adding water, molding and heating in an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide. The hydrophobicizing agent is used in a quantity of 0.5 to 12% by weight in the form of a higher fatty acid, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, coconut oil fatty acids, etc. and alkali/alkaline earth metal salts thereof.<br>
JP-A-83/41750 describes a material for boards which is obtained by reacting a hydraulic material, such as cement, a mixture of cement, granu-<br><br>
lated slag and gypsum, etc., an inorganic fiber-containing material, such as rock wool, glass fibers, etc., a viscosity-increasing material, such as methyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, etc., and a metal salt of a higher fatty acid, for example sodium stearate, potassium stearate, sodium oleate, potassium oleate, etc.<br>
JP-A-83/36955 relates to mortar compositions in which granulated blast-furnace slag of very high uniform quality is used as aggregate. The mixtures in question contain 10 parts by weight of calcium sulfate monohy-drate and 50 to 200 parts by weight of granulated blast-furnace slag as aggregate, 0.03 to 3 parts by weight of phosphate, 0.03 to 3 parts by weight of a protein-based retarder and, if necessary, additives including inter alia a fatty acid salt.<br>
JP-A-82/175764 describes a water-repellent board of an inorganic material which is obtained, for example, by adding an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt of a fatty acid to a suspension containing a hydraulic inorganic material, for example cement or gypsum, a fibrous material and an aggregate. This mixture is introduced into a mold and set and is then dried by heat treatment until the internal temperature is above 80C. The addition of the aluminium salt of the fatty acid prevents overheating and also fracture and the flaking of layers.<br>
It is known from EP-A-321816 that ethoxylated C12-22 fatty alcohols with an HLB value of 4.5 to 11 can be added as surfactant components to gypsum-based compositions to which hydroxyalkylated methyl cellulose is optionally added. The compounds thus produced may be used as mortars, fillers, etc. The addition of the ethoxylated fatty alcohols prevents the composition from forming lumps when it is mixed with water.<br>
Gypsum additives based on fatty alcohols containing at least 10 carbon atoms are described in "ConChem Journal" Vol. 2 (1994), page 23.<br>
JP-A-90/296780 relates to a low-density gypsum product obtained by foaming a gypsum suspension using a sulfonate of a C10-6 fatty acid alkyl<br><br>
ester as foaming agent.<br>
EP-A-54175 describes mortar mixtures based on cement, gypsum and/or calcium hydroxide, standard fillers and auxiliaries, in which 0.05 to 0.5% of a water-soluble nonionic cellulose ether and 0.01 to 0.05% of an ethylene oxide adduct of a fatty alcohol and/or fatty acid or an amide thereof is added to the water-free mortar mixture. These mortar mixtures are used in the production of an air-entraining mortar, gypsum and calcium-hydroxide-containing adhesive mortars, for example for laying roof tiles and mosaics, and for air-entraining Portland cement based on a mortar binder.<br>
DE 2908271 describes the subsequent coating of gypsum plaster-boards, for example, with water-based wax, paraffin and resign dispersions.<br>
The problem addressed by the present invention was to provide a gypsum-based composition which uses a special oleochemical additive or mixtures of different additives to modify the properties of the gypsum. Property modifications in the present context include, in particular, hydrophobicization, control of the setting times, rheology and water retention capacity and also elasticization.<br>
This problem has been solved by the characterizing features of claim 1.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of producing a dry gypsum-based composition using 0.1 to 30% by weight based on the dry mixture as a whole of at least one oleochemical additive selected from<br>
-	at least one fatty compound containing at least one carboxyl group and at least 8 carbon atoms and/or a salt thereof with a molecular weight of 143 to 20,000,<br>
-	at least one fatty compound containing at least one hydroxyl group and at least 8 carbon atoms with a molecular weight of 130 to 20,000,<br>
-	at least one fatty compound containing at least one ester group, the acid component and/or the alcohol component containing at least 8 carbon<br><br>
atoms, with a molecular weight of 158 to 20,000,<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one ether group, at least<br>
one of the two ether groups containing at least 8 carbon atoms with a<br>
molecular weight of 144 to 20,000,<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one amino group or at<br>
least one quaternary ammonium salt, at least one of the three or four<br>
groups arranged around the nitrogen atom containing at least 8 carbon<br>
atoms, with a molecular weight of 129 to 20,000,<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one amide group, the acid<br>
component of the amide containing at least 8 carbon atoms, with a<br>
molecular weight of 157 to 20,000,<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one epoxide group and<br>
at least 8 carbon atoms with a molecular weight of 128 to 20,000,<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one anhydride group and<br>
at least 8 carbon atoms with a molecular weight of 210 to 20,000,<br>
at least one organophosphorus fatty compound containing at least 8<br>
carbon atoms with a molecular weight of 193 to 20,000,<br>
at least one organoboron fatty compound containing at least 8 carbon<br>
atoms with a molecular weight of 174 to 20,000,<br>
at least one organosulfur fatty compound containing at least 8 carbon<br>
atoms with a molecular weight of 164 to 20,000,<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one urethane group and<br>
at least 8 carbon atoms with a molecular weight of 213 to 20,000 and/or<br>
at least one fatty compound containing at least one keto group and at<br>
least 8 carbon atoms with  molecular weight of 130 to 20,000,<br>
with the proviso that a higher fatty acid or salt thereof is not used on its<br>
own as the at least one fatty compound containing at least one carboxyl<br>
group, with the further proviso that a fatty alcohol or ethoxylated fatty<br>
alcohol is not used on its own as the at least one fatty compound<br>
containing at least one hydroxyl group, with the further proviso that a<br><br>
natural fat or oil is not used on its own as the at least one fatty compound containing at least one ester group,<br>
with the further proviso that a sulfonate of a C10-16 fatty acid alky! ester is not used on its own as the organosulfur fatty compound and with the proviso that an ethylene oxide adduct of a fatty acid amide is not used as the at least one fatty compound containing at least one amide group. The main component of the gypsum-based composition according to the invention is a gypsum in the form of the anhydride or hemihydrate, including all the chemical modifications (a- and 3-hemihydrate, anhydrite I, II, III), based on natural gypsum, synthetic gypsum or gypsum from the desul-furization of waste gases. In principle, these hydraulically setting versions based on CaS04 may be present both in pure form and also in the form of mixtures.<br>
The natural gypsum used is normally a P-gypsum of the type obtained in the kiln process or in the kettle process. A corresponding multiphase gypsum is obtained by the travelling grate process while an a-gypsum is obtained by the autoclave process.<br>
In the case of the gypsums used in the form of synthetic gypsums, the 3-gypsum is obtained by the Knauf kiln process, by the Knauf kettle process and by the kettle process without recrystallization. A corresponding multiphase gypsum is obtained as synthetic gypsum by the Knauf aggregate calcination process while an a-gypsum is obtained by Giulini autoclave process.<br>
Today, however, large quantities of gypsum come from the desulfur-ization of waste gases, for example by the Bischoff process, by the Saarberg-Holter process and also by the mining research process. In 1990, for example, around 2 million tonnes of residual gypsum were produced. The a-hemihydrate from WGDP gypsum (WGDP = waste gas desulfurization plant) has acquired particular significance in this regard.<br><br>
In the gypsum-based compositions, gypsum from the provenances mentioned above is present as the principal product In quantities of 50 to 99.9% by vkeight and preferably in quantities of 70 to 98% by weight, based on the inorganic binder component of the dry mixture.<br>
Fatty compounds in the context of the present invention are fatty acids, fatty alcohols and derivatives or secondary products thereof obtainable from natural oils, more especially vegetable and animal oils.<br>
In nature, they occur in the form of natural mixtures of various fatty acid glycerol esters, for example in the form of palm oil, palm kernel oil, palm stearin, olive oil, rapeseed oil, coriander oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, linseed oil, lard oil, fish oil, fish train oil or lard.<br>
It can be of particular advantage to start out from coconut oil, palm kernel oil or beef tallow by virtue of their high natural content of saturated fatty acids.<br>
In addition to these fatty mixtures, the corresponding individual substances may also be used.<br>
Examples of saturated fatty acids containing 8 to 26 and preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms are caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachic, behenic, cerotic, pentadecanoic, margaric, tridecanoic and lignoceric acid. Examples of unsaturated fatty acids containing 8 to 26 and preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms are myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, elaidic, petroselic, erucic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, clupanodonic, docosa-hexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic and gadoleic acid.<br>
Examples of saturated fatty alcohols containing 8 to 26 and preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms, which are industrially synthesized by reduction (hydrogenation) of fatty acid methyl esters, are caproic alcohol, caprylic alcohol, pelargonic alcohol, capric alcohol, lauric alcohol, myristic alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, gadoleyl alcohol and behenyl alcohol.<br>
Fatty compounds derived from the above-mentioned structural elements and functionalized in accordance with the required effect in the<br><br>
gypsum are used in accordance with the invention. Derivatives with a molecular weight of &gt; 129 to 20,000, as determined by GPC, or oligomerized fatty compounds with a molecular weight of &gt; 1,000 and polymeric fatty compounds with a molecular weight of &gt; 2,000 are preferably used.<br>
Since these substances are generally complex mixtures, the fatty compounds according to the invention are characterized in the following by the most important functional groups present in them.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment, the oleochemical additive is at least one fatty compound containing a carboxyl group selected above all from oxidation products of Guerbet alcohols. Guerbet alcohols may be obtained, for example, by autocondensation of fatty alcohols in the presence of alkalis (Soap, Cosm. Chem. Spec. 53 (1987)). Examples include 2-hexyl decanoic acid, 2-octyl dodecanoic acid, 2-decyl tetradecanoic acid, 2-dodecyl hexadecanoic acid, 2-tetradecyl octadecanoic acid, 2-hexadecyl eicosanoic acid, etc. Mixtures of technical Guerbet alcohols may optionally be used.<br>
The fatty compound containing at least one carboxyl group may also be selected from adducts of unsaturated fatty acids with dieneophiles such as, for example, acrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, acetylene dicarboxylic acid, styrene, cyclopentadiene and a-olefins.<br>
Reference is also made in this regard to the polymerization of fatty acids by radical polymerization or heat treatment. The fatty acids may also be obtained by polymerization of fatty acid esters and subsequent hydrolysis of the ester group. Examples include dimer and trimer fatty acids and also the branched fatty acids formed as secondary dimerization products, for example isostearic acid and isopalmitic acid.<br>
Other suitable fatty compounds containing at least one carboxyl group are fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis of blown and oxidized triglycerides. Examples include fatty acid mixtures of blown fish oil and blown rapeseed oil.<br>
Finally, this definition also encompasses undecylenic acid as a secondary product of the pyrolysis of ricinoleic acid methyl ester.<br><br>
In a first preferred embodiment, the fatty compounds used are in particular those which contain at least one hydroxyl group in addition to at least one carboxyl group. Examples of such fatty compounds are ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid and 11-hydroxyundecanoic acid as an inter¬mediate product in the synthesis of Nylon-11, reaction products of epoxidized fatty acid esters with water, for example 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid or 9,10,12,13-tetrahydroxystearic acid.<br>
In addition, after the first class of fatty compounds, the oleochemical additive preferably contains at least one hydroxy group in addition to at least one carboxyl group. Examples of this class of oleochemical additives are partial esters of polybasic carboxylic acids or anhydrides with fatty com¬pounds containing several hydroxyl groups. Examples of such products are partial esters of citric acid with C8.26 fay alcohols or castor oil, semiesters of maleic acid with dimer alcohol or semiesters of phthalic anhydride with castor oil.<br>
Also suitable are reaction products of epoxidized C8.100 fatty acid esters with an excess of polybasic carboxylic acids, for example the reaction product of epoxidized soybean oil with adipic acid.<br>
Finally, reaction products of fatty compounds containing ester and hydroxyl groups (for example castor oil) with a,3-unsaturated acids, such as acrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid or maleic acid using radical initiators may also be used.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the first class of fatty compounds consists of compounds which contain at least one carboxyl function, at least one hydroxyl function and at least one ether group. Fatty compounds of this class include reaction products of epoxidized fatty acid esters with monohy-dric or polyhydric alcohols in which the ester group is subsequently hydrolyzed. Examples are hydroxymethoxystearic acid and hydroxybutoxy-stearic acid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the first class of fatty compounds<br><br>
contain both at least one ester group and at least one carboxyl group. Examples of such fatty compounds are addition products of unsaturated fatty acid esters with dieneophiles, such as acrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and acetylene dicarboxylic acid and addition products of unsaturated 0.26 fatty acids with the corresponding esters.<br>
Reaction products of maleicized fatty acid esters with monohydric and higher alcohols to semiesters are also suitable. The products may be oligomeric or polymeric in character.<br>
It is also possible to use carboxyl-terminated esters of fatty acids, polyhydric alcohols and polybasic carboxylic acids, as described in "Resins for Surface Coatings", Volume III, Edited by Dr. P Oldring &amp; G. Hayward, SITA Technology (London), 1987, page 188. Corresponding products may also be obtained by transesterification of fatty acid esters with polyhydric alcohols and subsequent esterification with polybasic carboxylic acids.<br>
Finally, esters of hydroxyfunctional fatty compounds with polybasic carboxylic acids in excess may also be used.<br>
Another class of substances within the first group of fatty compounds are those which contain at least one ester group and at least one ether group in addition to at least one carboxyl group. Examples of such fatty compounds are carboxyl-terminated polyesters of ring-opening products of epoxidized fatty acid esters with monohydric and polyhydric alcohols with subsequent reaction with a molar excess of polybasic carboxylic acids. Reaction products of methanol-ring-opened epoxidized rapeseed oil with phthalic anhydride are mentioned as an example of such fatty compounds. Another subclass of fatty compounds belonging to the first class comprises fatty compounds which contain at least one ester group and at least one anhydride group in addition to at least one carboxyl group. Adducts of fatty acid esters with maleic anhydride partly reacted with water or monohydric or polyhydric alcohols belong to this other subclass of fatty compounds of the first class. Partial reaction products of maleicized soybean oil with butanol are mentioned as<br><br>
examples.<br>
Another subgroup of fatty compounds belonging to the first class are those which contain at least one anhydride group in addition to at least one carboxyl group. This other subgroup includes reaction products of unsatu¬rated fatty acids with maleic anhydride. The reaction may be carried out both thermally and also radically. Representative examples of this other subgroup include maleicized linoleic acid and maleicized oleic acid. The second class of oleochemical additives according to the invention includes fatty com¬pounds which contain at least one hydroxyl group. They are obtained by guerbetization of saturated and unsaturated fatty alcohols. Examples of such Guerbet alcohols are 2-hexyl decanol, 2-octyl dodecanol, 2-decyl tetra-decanol, 2-dodecyl hexadecanol, 2-tetradecyl octadecanol, 2-hexadecyl eicosanol, Guerbet alcohol from erucyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol and ocenols. Mixtures resulting from the guerbetization of technical fatty alcohols may optionally be used.<br>
Fatty compounds containing several hydroxyl groups, for example ricinoleyl alcohol, 12-hydroxystearyl alcohol, dimer diol containing 18 to 52 carbon atoms and trimer triol (hydrogenation products of dimer and trimer fatty acid esters).<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the second class of oleochemical additives may contain both at least one hydroxyl group and at least one ester group. Examples of such oleochemical additives belonging to the second class are castor oil, partly dehydrated castor oils, castor oils partly acylated with monobasic and polybasic carboxylic acids, polyesters of ricinoleic acid and 12-hydroxystearic acid (Estolids); reaction products of epoxidized fatty compounds with monobasic and polybasic carboxylic acids or monohydric and polyhydric alcohols; transesterification products of fatty acid esters with polyhydric alcohols (partial glycerides); transesterification products of castor oil with other triglycerides, such as rapeseed oil, sunflower oil under alkaline randomization conditions; esters of fatty alcohols with hydroxycarboxylic<br><br>
acids, for example tartaric acid, citric acid, glucose acid. These products may also be obtained by a reaction similar to the alkyd resin synthesis of fatty acids, monohydric and polyhydric alcohols and polybasic carboxylic acids to form hydroxyl-terminated oligomers. Corresponding products may also be prepared by transesterification of fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and subsequent esterification with polybasic carboxylic acids. Other typical representatives are partial esters of fatty acids with polyhydric alcohols, for example glycerol monooleate, trimethylol propane distearate, pentaglycerol monolaurate, sorbitan monococoate. Hydroxyl-terminated esterification products of hydroxyl-containing fatty compounds with polybasic carboxylic acids.<br>
Another subclass of the second class includes fatty compounds which contain at least one amine group or a corresponding quaternary ammonium salt in addition to at least one hydroxyl group and at least one ester group. Examples of these fatty compounds are reaction products of epoxidized fatty acid esters with monofunctional and polyfunctional amines without amidation of the ester function. One example of such a reaction product is the reaction product of epoxystearic acid methyl ester and 1,6-diaminohexane, amidation of fatty acid esters, more especially triglycerides, with ammonia, monofunc¬tional and polyfunctional amines without removal of the glycerol, optionally with partial amidation.<br>
In another preferred subclass of the second class, the fatty compounds contain not only at least one hydroxyl group, but also at least one ester group and at least one amide group. Corresponding products are obtained by amidation of fatty acid esters, more especially triglycerides, with ammonia, monofunctional and polyfunctional amines without removal of the alcohol component from the ester (glycerol). One example of such a product is the reaction product of rapeseed oil with less than the equivalent quantity of stearylamine.<br>
In another preferred subclass of the second preferred embodiment of<br><br>
ir<br>
fatty compounds, the fatty compounds may contain at least one ester group and at least one anhydride group in addition to at least one hydroxyl group. Examples of such fatty compounds are reaction products of a hydroxyl-containing fatty acid ester, such as castor oil, with maleic anhydride in the  presence as catalysts of radical initiators such as, for example, ditert.butyl peroxide, AIBN, tert.butyl hydroperoxide and dibenzoyi peroxide.<br>
In another preferred subclass of the preferred second class, the oleochemical additives may contain at least one ether group in addition to at least one hydroxyl group. Corresponding compounds are obtained by etherification (for example by dehydration using acidic catalysts) of fatty compounds containing several hydroxyl group (for example ricinoleyl alcohol, 12-hydroxystearyl alcohol, dimer diol, trimer triol) to oligomeric hydroxyl-terminated polyethers. The production of such fatty compounds is described in DE 4316245 (A1).<br>
Another preferred subclass of the second class of preferred fatty compounds includes those fatty compounds which contain at least one amide group in addition to at least one hydroxyl group.

It is obvious that not only mixtures of oleochemical additives belonging to each class, but also mixtures of any components belonging to the individual classes with one another may be used.<br>
The oleochemical additive mentioned above may be blended with gypsum and, optionally, other ingredients in various ways. First, there is the so-called one-component variant where the gypsum-based composition contains gypsum, the oleochemical additive and the other auxiliaries and additives. Accordingly, the user need only add water so that this variant is particularly preferred. The oleochemical components may be mixed either purely physically with the gypsum powder and the other auxiliaries and additives. Alternatively, however, these components may also be applied to the gypsum or adsorbed thereon or applied by coating, i.e. at temperatures above room temperature (&gt; 25°C).<br>
Alternatively, there is of course also a two-component in situ variant<br><br>
where the gypsum is mixed with water before the addition of water either after or at the same time as the oleochemical components and the other auxiliaries and additives.<br>
In a third preferred embodiment of the invention, the salts of carboxyl-containing fatty compounds, for example of the corresponding fatty acids with amines, for example monoethanolamine, are added at room temperature and may then be reacted to the corresponding amines, for example in the production of gypsum plasterboards, with elimination of water.<br>
Finally, the present invention also relates to the use of the oleo¬chemical additives mentioned above for the impregnation or coating of prefabricated gypsum components or gypsum plasters. To this end, the oleo¬chemical components may be applied either directly or even in the form of a solution in a solvent or in the form of a dispersion or emulsion in water. Any of the usual methods of application, such as dip coating, spray coating, roll coating, brush coating, etc., may be applied.<br>

for the subsequent treatment of gypsum components and gypsum plasters.<br>
As already mentioned, the oleochemical additives containing carboxyl groups, i.e. additives belonging to the first class, may be used both as such and in the form of their salts. The counterion of the carboxyl group may be selected both from inorganic ions, such as monovalent or polyvalent metal ions, or ammonia and from the corresponding organic bases, such as alkanolamines, amines, etc.<br>
The salts are prepared in the same way as metal soaps from the acids<br><br>
r<br>
and the metal or amine compounds under mildly to strongly alkaline conditions. In many cases, the oxides or hydroxides are also used in equimolar quantities for salt formation. Salt formation may also be carried out in situ during preparation of the gypsum/water mixture. In addition, salt conversion, i.e. the conversion of sodium soaps or salts into calcium salts or others, is also possible. Salt forming processes are described in the synoptic article entitled "Metallic Soaps" in Ullmann, Encyclopedia of Technical Chemistry, Vol. A 16, pages 361 et seq.<br>
In the case of oleochemical additives containing fatty compounds with at least one amine group, corresponding salt formation can be carried out by alkylation or protonation with acids. In the case of oleochemical additives containing at least one carboxyl group in addition to at least one amine group, inner salts may even be formed. Since both calcium sulfate hemihydrate and calcium sulfate dihydrate have a certain solubility in water, free calcium ions are present and are also capable of subsequently forming salts with the carboxyl groups.<br>
In addition, gypsums also contain other metal ions, for example sodium, magnesium, potassium, strontium, lithium, rubidium, iron(ll), barium, molybdenum(ll), zinc, aluminium and manganese(ll), which are also capable of forming salts with carboxyfunctional fatty compounds during mixing of the gypsum or even after curing, cf. for example the article in "Chemie in unserer Zeit", Vol. 19 (1985), pages 137 to 143. Salt formation can take place during stirring of the gypsum by adding the substances capable of forming salts, for example carboxyfunctional fatty compounds and bases (for example Ca(0H)2, amines), eithf;;r at the same time or after certain time intervals. In the case of amine-containing fatty compounds, the correspond¬ing acids have to be added.<br>
Other components of the gypsum-containing compositions according to the invention are, for example, typical fillers, auxiliaries and additives which vary according to the application envisaged. These additional components<br><br>
are, above all, mineral and/or inorganic fillers, for example clays, sand, gravel, cement, slags, glass, silica gels, sulfates (for example calcium sulfate dihydrate), oxides (for example magnesium oxide, calcium oxide), glass and mineral fibers, synthetic fibers, hollow microbeads, light organic fillers (for example polystyrene foam), granules (refined) from recycling plants, paper powder, wood chips and sawdust, cellulose fibers, etc. Other suitable additives are preservatives, rustproofing agents and dyes.<br>
Drying agents of the type typically used in paints, varnishes and printing inks may be added as another ingredient of the gypsum-based composition according to the invention. According to 55901 (March 1988), drying agents are understood to be metal salts of organic acids which are soluble in organic solvents and binders and which are added to oxidatively drying products to accelerate the drying process. Chemically, drying agents belong to the metal soaps and may be present both in solid and in dissolved form as so-called siccatives. However, they may also be applied in water-emusifiable form in combination with emulsifiers. The acid component may be, for example, an aliphatic carboxylic acid, such as octanoic acid, or a fatty acid, a naphthenic acid or even a resin acid. Corresponding salts of cobalt, manganese or lead, but preferably cobalt or manganese, are used as primary drying agents which directly accelerate oxidation of the fatty compounds. Salts of zinc, iron, calcium, cerium, lead and barium may be used as secondary drying agents which do not have any catalytic effect of their own, but act synergistically in combination with the drying agents mentioned above. Finally, salts of zirconium and aluminium may be used as co-ordinative drying agents. Examples of commercially available drying agents are the products Additol VXM 6206 and 4940, Soiingen, Cobalt 10, linseed oil varnish, Nuodex Cerium 6 and Zinc 8, Alusec 591 and Nourydrier 973. However, there is no need for the salts mentioned above where the fatty compounds according to the invention containing at least one carboxyl group are used. In that case, inorganic salts, for example hydroxides, of the above-<br><br>
mentioned metals may be used so that the drying agents are formed in situ. The drying agents are normally used in quantities of 0.01 % by weight to 1 % by weight, based on the oleochemical additive.<br>
Other ingredients of the gypsum-based composition according to the invention are substances with a setting effect which reduce the water demand and which are normally referred to as plasticizers. Examples are alkylaryl sulfonates, lignin sulfonic acid salts or melamine resins. A review of plasticizers can be found, for example, in "Zement, Kalk, GIps", Vol. 21, pages 415 to 419 (1968). The plasticizers are normally used in quantities of 0 to 10%, based on the composition according to the invention as a whole.<br>
The water demand may also be increased by addition of substances with a flocculating effect, for example the polyethylene oxides described, for example, in GB-A-1,049,184. These auxiliaries may be added in quantities of 0 to 10% by weight, based on the dry mixture.<br>
A water/gypsum mix may be stabilized to prevent sedimentation or separation by addition of thickening chemicals, for example cellulose and starch ethers. These thickeners have hardly any effect on the water demand. The thickeners are added to the dry mixture according to the invention in quantities of 0 to 5% by weight, based on the dry mixture. Polymer disper¬sions may also be added to the gypsum during stirring, in particular to improve elasticity and adhesion.<br>
In addition, the compositions according to the invention may contain auxiliaries acting as accelerators. The accelerators may be selected in particular from various inorganic acids and salts thereof, more particularly sulfuric acid and salts thereof. Calcium sulfate dihydrate occupies a special position in this regard. In finely dispersed form, it has a strong accelerating effect and, accordingly, has to be completely removed during the calcination of raw gypsum. The accelerating effect of these substances is generally based on an increase in the solubility and dissolving rate of the calcined gypsum and on an increase in the nudeation rate.<br><br>
other auxiliaries in the gypsum-based composition according to the invention are known retarders which slow down the stiffening and hardening process. They include above all organic acids and salts thereof, organic colloids which are also formed, for example, as degradation products in the hydrolysis of high molecular weight natural substances, for example proteins, and also salts of phosphoric acid or boric acid. Dextrins and hibiscus roots are also suitable. The retarding mechanism is variable. Colloids of relatively high molecular weight prolong the induction period because they are nucleus poisons. Other retarders slow down the dissolving rate of the hemihydrate and the growth of the dihydrate crystals. Retardation of anhydride II Is generally of no practical interest because it already changes into dihydrate sufficiently slowly and always has to be accelerated. The percentage content of this component in the gypsum compositions according to the invention may be from 0 to 5% by weight, based on the dry mixture.<br>
As known to the expert, the quantity of water used depends upon the type of gypsum starting material used, i.e. to obtain a free-flowing mix of uniform consistency, a kiln 3-gypsum requires more than one kettle gypsum which in turn requires more than one multiphase gypsum which, for its part, requires more than one autoclave gypsum. In addition, the quantity of water also has a significant bearing both on the unit weight and on the strength of the gypsum product formed. Without any special measures, a-gypsums which can be processed with very small quantities of water give gypsum products of high unit weight and high strength which are avoided in the building industry on account of their unwanted brittleness. p-Gypsums and multiphase gypsums require more water than a-gypsums for a free-flowing consistency. Accordingly, they give gypsum products of average strength and relatively high elasticity for lower unit weights which are used throughout the building industry. To produce lightweight or porous gypsum, it is possible for example to add hydrogen peroxide (evolution of oxygen) or dilute acids and carbonates (evolution of CO2).<br><br>
The present invention also relates to a gypsum-based composition of the type mentioned above which, in addition to gypsum and the oleochemical additive, also contains 0 to 80% of a filler, 0 to 2% of a wetting agent, 0 to 5% of a plasticizer, 0 to 5% of an accelerator, 0 to 5% of a retarder, based in each case on the mixture as a whole.<br>
Another problem addressed by the present invention was to enable the gypsum-based compositions according to the invention to be used for the production of gypsum products.<br>
The products in question are, on the one hand, so-called prefabricated gypsum components used widely in the building industry in the form of gypsum plaster boards, gypsum wall boards and gypsum ceiling boards. A relevant overview can be found in Ullmann's En7yklop3die der technischen Chemie, Vol. 12, page 307 (1976). The gypsum-based compositions according to the invention may also be used in the form of grouting com¬pounds and gypsum plasters, more particularly during further processing to machine-applied gypsum plasters and ready-mixed gypsum plasters. Finally, the gypsum-based compositions according to the invention may also be used for floor screeds, for longwall packs in mining and, where they are based on a-gypsum, as a hard mold material in the roof tile industry, in metal foundries and in dental laboratories. A relevant overview can be found in Ullmann's Enzyklopadie dertechnischen Chemie, Vol. 12, page 308 et seq. (1976).<br>

The measurements of the setting rate and the water absorption capacity were carried out as follows:<br>
The oleochemical additive was added to 70 ml of water. 140 g of gypsum (CaS04 • HjO) (Alfor, a product of Bbrgardts-Sachsenstein; density 2.63, apparent density 900 g/l) were then added with vigorous stirring. When the mixture was homogeneous, a test specimen was cast in an 85 mm diameter aluminium dish and its setting rate was measured. After storage for 48 hours, water absorption was measured by pouring 10 ml of water into a depression in the test specimen and measuring the time (in minutes) required for complete permeation. The percentage of additives shown is based on the water/gypsum mixture as a whole (210 g). So far as this test is concerned, it is important to remember that, where the permeation time is several hours, as is possible in the case of additive 1, a large part of the water also<br><br>
evaporates.<br>
The results are set out in the following Table. All the oleochemical additives act as setting retarders and, in some cases, as hydrophobicizing agents.<br><br><br><br>
