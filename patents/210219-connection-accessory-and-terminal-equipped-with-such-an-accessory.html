The present invention relates to a connection accessory for connection of an electrical conductor such as an aluminum cable to a contact strip of an electrical apparatus such as a circuit breaker, and also to a terminal equipped with such an accessory.<br>
Conventional connection terminals are designed to perform connection of copper cables to the contact strips of apparatuses such as circuit breakers, but are not suitable for connection of aluminum cables. This results in the user, when he wants to use aluminum cables, having to replace the kit formed by the tunnel and screw by another kit designed for connection of aluminum cables.<br>
One of the reasons for this is that aluminum has a strong tendency to oxidize in the open air, which results in aluminum cables over the course of their use becoming covered with insulating alumina reducing the quality of the contact between the cable and contact strip.<br>
The other reason is that aluminum presents a high expansion coefficient due to the effect of temperature variations. Circuit breakers, since variable currents supply them, do however go through alternate heating and cooling phases. This results in temperature variations giving rise to variations in the dimensions of the cables by differential expansion. The cables are, however, in general in contact on the one<br><br>
hand with the contact strip most frequently made of copper, and on the other hand either with the steel screw or with the tunnel also made of steel. But these three materials present different expansion coefficients, which results in them not retracting in the same manner during the cooling phases. This leads to a connection-loosening phenomenon which on the one hand, in itself, reduces the quality of the electrical contact, and on the other hand fosters formation of a layer of alumina also liable to reduce the quality of the electrical contact.<br>
Several solutions have been imagined to overcome these shortcomings.<br>
One of the solutions is described in the German Patent DE 4,026,037. In this document, the cable is brought into contact with the contact strip by a steel tunnel moved in translation by the terminal screw. In order to overcome the problem of oxidation of the aluminum, the copper contact strip and the aluminum tunnel respectively present two serrations facing one another forming elongate claws designed to pass through the layer of alumina covering the cable, so as to improve the contact between the contact strip and tunnel.<br>
In this document, one of the above-mentioned problems has therefore been solved by achieving a specific system for connection of aluminum cables, which due to the presence of these claws presents a high cost price.<br>
Another solution is known wherein the terminal is formed by an aluminum block comprising on the one hand an elongate passage for passage of the contact strip and on the other hand a threaded orifice designed for passage of the terminal screw also made of aluminum. In this embodiment, the bottom wall of the tunnel presents a U-<br><br>
shaped cross section so as to match the shape of the cable, and the screw presents a convex end so that the cable is held captive between the bottom of the tunnel and the screw. In this embodiment, all the component parts being made of aluminum, no differential expansion occurs. The absence of differential expansion of the different elements and the fact that the cable is closely surrounded enable the problem of expansion of the aluminum cables and of formation of alumina on the cable to be satisfactorily solved. However, this solution still presents certain drawbacks resulting on the one hand from the fact that this tunnel has to present a large thickness whence a large quantity of alloy being necessary, and on the other hand from the fact that the tunnel being liable to oxidize itself needs to be tinned. This results in a terminal which is delicate to manufacture, costly and bulky.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves these problems and proposes a connection accessory enabling standard terminals to be used to perform connection of aluminum cables in simple and reliable manner.<br>
For this purpose, an object of the present invention is to achieve a connection accessory of the kind mentioned above, this accessory being characterized in that it comprises a pad made of a conducting material, said pad being designed to be fixed in removable manner onto the contact strip and to receive a conductor designed to be clamped against the pad by a clamping means in order to establish the electrical contact between the contact strip and the cable.<br><br>
Thus, when aluminum cables are to be connected, it is no longer necessary to replace the whole of the terminal, and a standard terminal can be used.<br>
According to  a  particular embodiment,  the above-mentioned  pad  presents an appreciably U-shaped transverse cross section.<br>
This particular pad shape enables a good electrical contact quality to be obtained.<br>
According to a particular feature, the above-mentioned pad comprises, on its face facing the conductor, serrations extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the conductor<br>
According to a particular feature, the pad is secured to the contact strip by means of a support, said support comprising a flexible blade fixed to the pad via one of its ends and comprising a curved part underneath the pad extending in a direction appreciably parallel to said pad, so as to enable flexible clamping of the contact strip between the pad and the curved part.<br>
According to another feature, the accessory being designed to be fitted in the tunnel of an electrical terminal, it comprises in addition at least one lug extending from the plane of the curved part in an inclined direction with respect to said plane and in a direction away from the pad, said at least one lug pressing against a wall of the tunnel so as to absorb the expansion differences between the different elements taking part in clamping.<br><br>
Advantageously the at least one lug is molded in the same material as the blade.<br>
Preferably the support comprises three lugs arranged in a triangle.<br>
Advantageously the curved part comprises a boss, on its face facing the pad, designed to enable the pad to be fitted onto contact strips of different thick nesses.<br>
An object of the invention is also to achieve a terminal equipped with an accessory comprising the previously mentioned features taken alone or in combination.<br>
The terminal can be of the fixed tunnel or of the movable tunnel type.<br>
Advantageously the tunnel comprises a recess in its bottom wall designed to receive the lug(s) of an accessory.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
But other advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from the following description which refers to the accompanying drawings given as a non-restrictive example only and in which:<br>
•	Figure 1 is a partial perspective view illustrating the rear part of a circuit breaker comprising a terminal equipped with a connection accessory according to the invention, the terminal and accessory having been removed from the apparatus,<br>
•	Figure 2 is a similar view to figure 1. the terminal and accessory being fitted in the rear part of the apparatus.<br><br>
Figures 3 and 4 are perspective views of the accessory,<br>
Figure 5 is a similar perspective view to figure 1, but illustrating a terminal<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In figures 1 and 2, a terminal 5 can be seen designed to be fitted in a housing 2 provided in the rear part of a circuit breaker 3 to perform connection of an electrical cable 6 to the contact strip 4 of the circuit breaker. This terminal is mainly formed by a metal block 5 of appreciably parallelepiped shape comprising an elongate passage 5b designed to receive the above-mentioned contact strip 4, and comprises at its upper part a tapped orifice into which a screw 7 called the terminal screw is screwed, designed to perform clamping of the cable 6 onto the contact strip 4. This screw 7 is accessible from the upper part of the apparatus and comprises at its end situated inside the terminal 5, a pad 8 comprising claws 8a designed to operate in conjunction with complementary recesses 4a provided in the contact strip 4.<br>
According to the invention, this terminal 5 is equipped with a connection accessory 9 designed to be used for performing connection of an aluminum cable to the contact<br>
strip.<br>
As is more particularly illustrated in figures 3 and 4, this accessory 9 comprises a pad 10 mounted on a support 11, the assembly being designed to be fixed flexibly to the circuit breaker contact strip 4. This pad 10 presents an appreciably U-shaped cross section and comprises, on its face 14 designed to receive the conductor 6, a set of<br><br>
serrations 12 extending perpendicularly to the direction of the cable 6 when it is inserted in the terminal.<br>
The support 11 is formed by a flexible blade fixed via one lib of its ends to one of the ends of the pad 10 and folded twice appreciably at right angles so as to form a curved part 11a extending underneath the pad 10 in a direction appreciably parallel to the pad 10.<br>
It can also be seen in these figures that the curved part 11a of the blade comprises three tabs or lugs 11c, lid, lie molded in the same material as the flexible blade and extending according to an inclined direction with respect to the plane of the curved part forming an angle a of about 30° with this plane. These tabs are designed to press via their end on the bottom wall 5c of a recess 5a provided in the terminal 5 to house these lugs.<br>
It can also be noted that the curved part 11a comprises a boss 11f, on its face facing the pad 10, designed to enable the pad 10 to be fitted either onto a 2.5 mm contact strip or onto a 1.6 mm contact strip.<br>
Advantageously, the screw 7 and its pad 8 are made of steel, whereas the block 5 is made of aluminum. The blade of the support 11 is made of stainless spring steel and riveted to the pad 10 of the accessory, which pad is advantageously made of tinned copper.<br>
According to the embodiment illustrated in figure 5, the circuit breaker terminal comprises a tunnel 13 mounted movable in translation in the terminal housing 2 of<br><br>
the apparatus between a disconnection position and a position wherein the tunnel 13 performs clamping of the cable 6 onto the contact strip (not represented).<br>
The connection operation of an aluminum cable onto the contact strip will be described hereafter with reference first of all to figures 1 and 2 and then to figure 5.<br>
According to the embodiment illustrated in figures 1 and 2, the block 5 is first of all inserted into the rear part 3 of the apparatus by sliding of said block 5 into the corresponding housing 2. Then the accessory 9 is fitted onto the contact strip 4 in such a way that the contact strip 4 is held flexibly between the pad 10 and the curved part 1 la of the flexible blade. The conductor 6 is then inserted in the passage 5b of the block and placed on the pad 10. Then tightening of the terminal screw 7 has the effect of applying the pad 8 with claws 8a onto the cable 6 and of performing clamping of the conductor 6 onto the contact strip 4 In this clamping position, the U-shape of the pad 10 enables the cable strands to be contained between the clawed pad 8 of the screw 7 and the pad 10 of the accessory 9 in order to prevent buckling thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the flexible lugs or tabs 11c, lid, 11e serve the purpose of maintaining a constant pressure on the screw thread to prevent the tunnel screw from coming loose due to the effect of the expansion differences of the aluminum cable and of the steel tunnel screw. They moreover reduce the risks of the screw coming loose due to the effect of vibrations.<br>
The connection operation by means of a device according to figure 5 is carried out in the same way as previously described for the first embodiment, the only difference<br><br>
being that it is the tunnel 13 which moves in translation and not the screw, and which performs clamping of the cable, said cable being fitted between the pad 10 of the accessory and the tunnel 13.<br>
This accessory enables standard terminals to be used (at present designed for copper cables) for connection of the aluminum cables while preserving a satisfactory electrical contact quality.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
