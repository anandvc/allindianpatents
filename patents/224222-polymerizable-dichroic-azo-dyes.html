[See section 10, Rule 13]<br><br><br><br>
POLYMERIZABLE DICHROIC AZO DYES;<br><br><br>
ROLIC AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS CHAMERSTRASSE 50, 6301 ZUG, SWITZERLAND.<br>
GRANTED<br>
26-2-2007<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. <br><br><br>
The invention relates to new polymerizable dichroic azo dyes, mesogenic polymeri-zable mixtures containing the same and their use for the preparation of dichroic polymer networks and gels, which for instance may find application as uniform or patterned polarizers.<br>
Many dyes have been developed for a variety of applications such as dyeing of fabrics, printing of textiles, coloring of plastics, color image formation in photography, etc. To provide the requisite properties, such as hue, solubility, affinity for the substrate, chemical resistance, and compatibility with the medium from which the dye is applied, the molecular structure and bond rigidity of the dye are specially designed for each application. Important properties required for the present application in mesogenic, polymerizable mixtures and dichroic polymer networks and gels, include the following: dichroism, solubility, high order parameter and stability of the dichroic polymer.<br>
Dichroism is the property whereby an oriented assembly of dye molecules exhibits relatively low absorption of a given wavelength of light in one state of orientation and a relatively high absorption of the same wavelength in another state of orientation with respect to the polarization direction of the light source. The orientation of the dye molecules can be brought about for example by dissolution in a solvent of liquid crystals or by embedding the dye in a stretched plastic.<br>
Solubility must be sufficiently high so that thin layers, e.g. in the range of micrometers, may contain enough dye molecules to have adequate light absorption in one of the orientate states. Ionic dyes will be generally inadequate because of their low solubility.<br>
Order parameter is a quantitative measure of the degree of molecular order or alignÂ¬ment in a given system. High order parameter is promoted by dyes with elongated shape having a large ratio of molecular length to width, similar to the shape of molecules of the liquid crystal host material. To assure an elongated shape, the molecules should have a rigid structure, which can be obtained, for example, by a substantially linear arrangement of benzene or heterocyclic rings.<br><br>
  Brightness and contrast of dichroic polymer networks or gels are both related to the order parameter S of the dye, where<br><br>
and I and  are the optical densities of a dichroic dye in a liquid crystal measured for light polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the liquid crystal director.<br>
Advantageously, the order parameter should exceed 0.70 and preferably should be as high as possible.<br>
Stability of the dichroic polymer means that the properties of the polymer containing the dichroic dye should not alter during time due to diffusion processes or inhomoge-neities caused by partial crystallization of the dye. It also means that the dichroic dyes should not migrate into adjacent layers if such polymers are designed for use in multilayer systems.<br>
Various dichroic dyes have been proposed as materials, which fulfill partly the above-described requirements. There are, however, still drawbacks, which should be improved. In particular, those having high order parameters have poor solubility or cause instability of the dichroic polymer, and those showing good stability of the dichroic polymer do not have a high order parameter. Thus, there is clearly a need for a concept whereby all or at least some of the above-described requirements may be fulfilled.<br>
With the forgoing in view, the present inventors have carried out extensive investigations and found that the incorporation of ring systems, which increase the width of the molecule, into azo-chromophores leads to dyes combining sufficient solubility and a very high order parameter, when at least one standard mesogenic ring system is attached at the chromophore, and that the above described stability problem can be overcome if the dichroic dye contains at least one polymerizable group.<br><br>

The dichroic azo dyes of the invention may readily be prepared using methods well known to the person skilled in the art, such as those documented in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart.<br>
For the preparation of dichroic polymer networks and gels, such as unstructured and structured polarizers, the dyes according to the present invention may be used singly. Alternatively, two or more of the dyes may also be used in combination. The number of dyes of formula I present in the prevailing host may depend mainly on the spectral working range of the polymer and on the solubility of the dyes. Colored polarizers, which are absorbing in a selective spectral range, may preferably be achieved by the presence of one or two dyes in the host. Black polarizers, selectively absorbing in the whole visible range, may preferably be achieved by the presence of three or more dyes.<br>
In general, the total content of the dichroic dyes of formula I according to the invention in the respective host may depend on different factors such as solubility in the host and absorption ability (extinction) of the dyes involved. Preferred dye concentrations may be in the range of 0.01 to 50 %wt, more preferably from 0.01 to 20 %wt, most preferably from 0.01 to 10 %wt.<br><br>
It is also feasible to mix a dichroic dye of this invention with another dichroic or non-dictiroic dye to use the resultant mixture as a dichroic dye of a desired color hue. No limitation is imposed in this concern.<br>
The mesogenic, polymerizable mixtures containing at least one dichroic dye of this invention comprise at least one polymerizable liquid crystal (LCP). Polymerizable liquid crystals are well known to the skilled person and are described e.g. in EP 0331233, WO 95/24454, US 5,567,349, US 5,650,534, WO 00/04110, WO 00/07975, WO 00/48985, WO 00/55110 and WO 00/63154. For adjustment of mesomorphic properties and suppression of crystallization, mixtures of two or more LCP components may also be used. The addition of isotropic compounds comprising two or more polymerizable groups, so called crosslinkers, may also be possible. Furthermore well known additives such as e.g. phenol derivatives for stabilization and photoinitiators such as e.g. IrgacureÂ® may also be present in the mixture.<br>
Preferred mixtures of the invention consequently comprise at least one dichroic dye according to the general formula I and at least one polymerizable liquid crystal and optionally additives, such as crosslinkers, stabilizers and photoinitiators.<br>
Particularly preferred are mixtures comprising one to four dichroic dyes of formula I and at least one polymerizable liquid crystal compound comprising two polymerizable groups and optionally additives such as crosslinkers, stabilizers and photoinitiators.<br>
The dichroic azo dyes according to the invention are also suitable for the creation of dyed cholesteric layers.<br>
When added to a cholesteric mixture the polymerizable dichroic azo dyes according to the invention can contribute to the enhancement of special color effects, and therefore their further use in the formation of dyed cholesteric devices is an additional and valuable asset.<br>
Further preferred mixtures of the invention therefore comprise at least one dichroic dye according to the general formula I and either at least one chiral polymerizable liquid crystal compound and optionally additives, such as crosslinkers, stabilizers and<br><br>
photoinitiators, or at least one polymerizable liquid crystal compound and at least one chiral component inducing the cholesteric phase and optionally additives, such as crosslinkers, stabilizers and photoinitiators, in order to produce dyed cholesteric mixtures.<br>
The polymerizable liquid crystalline mixtures according to the present invention may further be formed into dichroic polymer networks and gels. Dichroic polymer networks (hereinafter called dichroic liquid crystalline polymer films (LCP films)) have been found to be of particular use and, thus, a further aspect the invention provides dichroic films formed from mixtures according to the present invention.<br>
Such LCP films may readily be prepared by UV or thermal polymerization of the mixtures of the present invention. A film comprising a mixture according to the present invention is formed on a substrate, for example, by first preparing a solution of a mixture, which is subsequently applied to a support by different coating techniques, such as spincoating, miniscuscoating, wirecoating, slotcoating, offsetprinting, flexoprinting, gravureprinting and inkjet-printing. After evaporation of the solvent, the obtained film is polymerized using UV light to give a cross-linked dichroic liquid crystal film of preferably 0.5 to 5 micrometer thickness. If required, such films may further be coated with other layers, such as e.g. protective layers for protection against oxygen, UV irradiation or mechanical stress. Such films may be used in the manufacture of devices such as polarizers or optical filters.<br>
Examples of substrates used in the preparation of dichroic LCP films may include transparent substrates, such as glass or plastic, including an orientation layer, which is able to induce a uniform orientation to the mixture. Such orientation layers may include rubbed polyimide, or polyamide or preferably layers of photo-orientable materials. A well-suited kind of photo-orientable orientation layers are Linearly Photopolymerizable Polymers (LPP), also sometimes referred to as Photooriented Polymer Networks (PPN). Backgrounds and manufacturing of such orientation layers are disclosed in, for example, US 5,389,698, US 5,838,407, US 5,602,661, US 6,160,597, US 6,144,428, US 6,300,991 all of the applicant. Using LPP layers, segments (pixels) of locally varying orientation may be formed. Thus, not only uniformly aligned dichroic LCP layers but also structured complex orientation patterns within the dichroic LCP layers may be produced. Furthermore multilayer systems formed from stacks of alternating<br><br>
LPP and LCP layers, wherein at least one of the LCP layers is a dichroic LCP layer are feasible. Such layers or stacks of layers may additionally be covered by other well known functional layers, such as, e.g. protecting layers against oxygen or humidity or layers for protection against ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Recently it has been shown, e.g. in WO 99/64924, that photo-orienting materials like LPPs may also be able to orient liquid crystals, such as LCPs, if they are admixed to the mixture to be oriented prior to illumination with polarized light. In this way, orientation layers and LCP layers need not be formed separately. Thus, an analogous preparation of a dichroic LCP film using an inventive mixture, which in addition contains a photo-orientable material, is also be possible.<br>
The dichroic mixtures and films of the present invention may be used to prepare electro-optical and optical devices including security devices. A further aspect of the invention therefore provides an electro-optical or optical component or a security device comprising a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film formed from a mixture of the invention. Examples of optical or electro-optical components may include structured or unstructured optical filters, polarizers, etc. Security or authentication devices may for instance be used to safeguard banknotes, credit cards, securities, identity cards and the like against forgery and copying.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides an orientation layer containing at least one dichroic dye according to formula I. Such orientation layers, which are able to induce a uniform orientation to a liquid crystalline mixture, may include rubbed polyimide, or polyamide or preferably layers of photo-orientable materials. Such dyed orientation layers can be used in the manufacture of optical or electro-optical components, which may include structured or unstructured optical filters, polarizers or elements of security devices.<br>

EXAMPLES FOR THE PREPARATION OF DICHROIC MIXTURES<br>
The order parameter shown hereinafter in the examples 24-30 were each obtained by dissolving a dichroic dye in a LCP mixture MLCP- The mixture MLCP was composed of 99 weight % of the LCP monomer:<br><br>

EXAMPLES FOR THE PREPARATION OF DICHROIC LCP FILMS<br>
Samples of dichroic LCP films were prepared, whereby each sample comprised an alignment layer and a dichroic liquid crystal polymer layer. The alignment layers were made using the linearly photo-polymerizable aligning (LPP) technique. The preparation of the samples is described in the following.<br>
Suitable LPP materials for the production of an LPP orientation layer are, for example, described in patent publications EP 0 611 786, WO 96/10049 and EP 0 763 552, and include cinnamic acid derivatives and ferulic acid derivatives. For the examples, the following LPP material was chosen:<br><br>
A 2 % solution of this LPP material in methylpropylketone (MPK) as a solvent was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds at room temperature (20 Â°C). The layer was then dried for 5 to 10 minutes at 130 to 150 Â°C on a hot stage. Subsequently, the layer was exposed to linearly polarized light from a mercury high-pressure lamp for 10 to 550 seconds (depending on the strength of the lamp and on the characteristics of LPP and dichroic LCP layers) at room temperature. The layer was then used as an orientation layer for a liquid crystal material comprising dichroic dyes.<br>
For the production of the dichroic LCP layers, the mixtures MLCP/DYE were dissolved in anisole to give a 30 wt% solution. These LCP mixtures were then spin-coated at 800 rpm for 60 seconds on top of the photo-exposed LPP layers. The spin-coated dichroic LCP layers were then dried at 60 Â°C for approximately 1 minute on a hot stage. For photo-initiated cross-linking of the liquid crystals and dye components, the layers were exposed to isotropic light from a xenon lamp for about 5 minutes (depending on the strength of the lamp) in an inert atmosphere.<br>
