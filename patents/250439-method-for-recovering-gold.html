				<td>The invention relates to a method for recovering gold in connection with the<br>
hydrometallurgical production of copper from a waste or intermediate product<br>
containing sulphur and iron that is generated in the leaching of the copper<br>
raw material. The recovery of both copper and gold occurs in a chloride<br>
environment. The gold contained in the waste or intermediate is leached by<br>
means of divalent copper, oxygen and bromide in a solution of copper (II)<br>
chloride-sodium chloride, in conditions where the oxygen-reduction potential<br>
 is a maximum of 650 mV and the pH between 0.5 - 2.5.<br>
The Hydrocopper™ method for fabricating copper hydrometallurgically from<br>
a raw material containing copper such as copper sulphide concentrate is<br>
described in US patent publication 6,007,600. According to the method, the<br>
raw material is leached counter-currently with an alkali chloride-copper<br>
chloride solution in several stages to form a monovalent copper (I) chloride<br>
solution. Part of the solution that is formed is routed to oxidation performed<br>
with chlorine gas, whereupon the copper (II) chloride generated is circulated<br>
back to concentrate leaching. Solution purification is performed on the<br>
 remainder of the solution formed in raw material leaching. The pure cuprous<br>
chloride solution is precipitated by means of alkali hydroxide into copper (I)<br>
oxide and the oxide is reduced further into elemental copper. The alkali<br>
chloride solution formed during copper (I) oxide precipitation is processed<br>
further in chlorine-alkali electrolysis, from which the chlorine gas and/or<br>
chloride solution obtained is used for oxidising copper (I) chloride and/or raw<br>
material leaching, the alkali hydroxide generated in electrolysis is used for<br>
oxide precipitation and the hydrogen generated is used for elemental copper<br>
reduction. Gold recovery from the leaching residue is not described<br>
separately in connection with the method.<br>
Several methods are known in the prior art, which are used for leaching golcr /<br>
from materials containing sulphur and iron in connection with a chloride-<br>
based copper recovery process.<br>
US patent 4,551,213 describes a method, according to which gold can be<br>
leached from sulphur-containing materials, particularly from the residues of<br>
hydrometallurgical processes. The preferred starting material for the method<br>
is residue from the CLEAR process. The CLEAR process is a<br>
hydrometallurgical copper recovery process, which takes place in a chloride<br>
environment and at raised pressure. The gold-containing residue is elutriated<br>
into water and the suspension obtained is adjusted so that it contains 12 - 38<br>
weight percent of chloride. The oxidation-reduction potential is adjusted to<br>
the range of 650 - 750 mV and the pH value to be below 0. Copper (II)<br>
chloride or iron (III) chloride is added to the suspension to oxidise the gold<br>
contained in the raw material, whereupon it dissolves. It is mentioned in the<br>
publication that the oxidation-reduction potential must not rise above 750<br>
mV, because above this value the sulphur will dissolve. There is no<br>
information in the publication about the amount of dissolved sulphur or iron.<br>
EP patent 646185 concerns the recovery of copper from sulphidic<br>
concentrates by chloride leaching in atmospheric conditions. In the final<br>
stage of countercurrent leaching, gold is leached directly into the electrolyte<br>
from copper, zinc and lead electrolysis with a high oxidation potential. It is an<br>
essential feature of the method that the high oxidation potential is achieved<br>
by means of a halide complex such as BrCI"2, which is formed in electrolysis.<br>
According to example 4, which describes gold leaching, gold dissolves at an<br>
oxidation-reduction potential of about 700 mV vs Ag/AgCI.<br>
WO patent application 03/091463 describes a method for leaching gold from<br>
a leaching residue or intermediate containing iron and sulphur, which is<br>
generated in the atmospheric chloride leaching of copper sulphide<br>
concentrate. It states in the publication that it is possible to leach gold from a<br>
material containing iron and sulphur into an aqueous solution of copper (II)<br>
chloride and sodium chloride by means of divalent copper and oxygen in<br>
conditions where the oxidation-reduction potential is below 650 mV and the<br>
pH value of the solution is in the range of 1 - 3. In these conditions the iron<br>
does not yet dissolve and the sulphur remains largely undissolved, thus<br>
avoiding the costs that are incurred when removing iron and sulphur from the<br>
solution. The recovery of gold from the solution is carried out by means of<br>
one of the methods of the prior art such as electrolysis or activated carbon.<br>
The method in question is fairly good in itself, but in practice however it is a<br>
little slow.<br>
Now a new method has been developed for leaching gold from a leaching<br>
residue or intermediate containing iron and sulphur, which is generated in the<br>
atmospheric chloride leaching of copper sulphide concentrate and is<br>
essentially free of copper. We have found that when gold is leached from a<br>
material containing iron and sulphur into an aqueous solution of copper (II)<br>
chloride and alkali chloride and an oxygen-containing gas is fed into the<br>
solution, a small amount of bromide accelerates the time required for the<br>
gold to dissolve. Leaching takes place thus by means of divalent copper in<br>
conditions where the oxidation-reduction potential is regulated with oxygen in<br>
the range of 600 - 650 mV vs. Ag/AgCI electrode and the pH value of the<br>
solution is adjusted to the range of 0.5 - 2.5, preferably 0.5 - 1.5. The feed<br>
of bromide accelerates gold dissolution without causing the oxidation-<br>
reduction potential of the leaching to rise above the value of 650 mV.<br>
The gold-containing residue or intermediate is elutriated into an alkali<br>
chloride solution containing copper (II) chloride making a suspension and the<br>
oxidation-reduction potential required for gold leaching is achieved just by<br>
means of divalent copper and oxygen. To enhance leaching some alkali<br>
bromide such as sodium or potassium bromide is fed into the suspension<br>
that is formed so that the Br ion concentration of the gold leaching step is 0.5<br>
- 30 g/l, preferably 8-15 g/l. After the gold leaching stage the gold-containing<br>
solution is routed to the gold recovery step, after which the solution is<br>
circulated back to the leaching stage.<br>
Leaching occurs in atmospheric conditions at a temperature which is in the<br>
range between room temperature and the boiling point of the suspension,<br>
preferably however at a temperature between 80°C and the boiling point of<br>
the suspension. Gold recovery from the solution is made using some method<br>
known in the prior art such as electrolysis or by means of activated carbon.<br>
The remaining residue is a dischargeable residue. When the gold has been<br>
recovered from the solution, the solution is circulated back to the gold<br>
leaching stage.<br>
The essential features of the invention will be made apparent in the attached<br>
claims.<br>
It is advantageous to connect the method now developed to a copper<br>
concentrate chloride leaching process as a sub-process. As mentioned<br>
above, one such process is described in e.g. US patent 6,007,600. In the<br>
method in question a raw material containing copper sulphide such as<br>
concentrate is leached countercurrently with a solution of alkali chloride and<br>
copper (II) chloride, NaCI-CuCI2, in several stages to form a solution of<br>
monovalent copper (I) chloride, CuCI. The alkali chloride solution formed in<br>
the process is processed in chlorine alkali electrolysis and the alkali<br>
hydroxide, chlorine and hydrogen formed in electrolysis are exploited in<br>
various stages of the process. A residue remains after concentrate leaching,<br>
which mainly contains the sulphur and iron of the raw material as well as the<br>
gold contained in the raw material. The method now developed focuses on<br>
the residue of gold leaching, which is formed in the type of process<br>
mentioned above. The leaching step of a waste or intermediate that contains<br>
gold occurs in principle separately from the actual concentrate leaching step,<br>
since the solution from which gold is separated, instead of being returned to<br>
the concentrate leaching circuit, is circulated back to gold leaching.<br>
The oxidation-reduction potential in the gold leaching stage is measured with<br>
Pt and Ag/AgCI electrodes and the potential is kept at a value of maximum<br>
650 mV, preferably at a maximum of 640 mV. When the oxidation-reduction<br>
potential is kept below a value of 650 mV, sulphur does not yet dissolve from<br>
the residue, and remains as elemental sulphur. The preferred pH range is<br>
between 0.5 and 1.5, so that the iron in the residue remains mostly<br>
undissolved. The oxidation gas used may be air, oxygen-enriched air or<br>
oxygen. The amount of divalent copper, Cu2+, in solution is preferably 40 -<br>
100 g/l and the amount of sodium chloride in the range of 200 - 330 g/l.<br>
If the chloride solution used in gold leaching is a sodium chloride solution,<br>
the alkali bromide to be fed is also preferably sodium bromide. Sodium is<br>
lower in price than potassium, so its use is therefore justified. The majority of<br>
bromide to be fed into the gold leaching stage is in circulation inside the<br>
leaching stage. A small part of it, 0.5 - 10%, however, is removed with the<br>
filtrate, which is formed during the filtration performed on the gold leaching<br>
residue. To avoid bromine losses, the filtrate is routed to the oxidation stage<br>
belonging to the concentrate leaching step. In the oxidation stage, part of the<br>
copper (I) chloride formed in concentrate leaching is oxidised back to copper<br>
(II) chloride by means of the chlorine formed in chlorine alkali electrolysis,<br>
which is fed into the final stage of the concentrate leaching process. Chlorine<br>
gas also oxidises the bromide in the filtrate into bromine gas, which is<br>
recovered in a scrubber connected to the oxidation stage, in which it<br>
dissolves into the washing fluid. As for the scrubber washing fluid, it is routed<br>
to the gold leaching stage. The scrubber washing fluid is circulated back to<br>
the gold leaching stage, in which the leaching stage slurry reduces the<br>
bromine back into bromide.<br>

example 2.<br>
The flow chart according to Figure 1 is one example of an embodiment of our<br>
invention. The solid arrows in Figure 1 describe the flow of solids and the<br>
dashed arrows the flow of the solution.<br>
A copper sulphide raw material, such as copper sulphide concentrate, is fed<br>
into the first leaching stage 1, into which is circulated a solution 3, which is<br>
an aqueous solution of copper (II) chloride and alkali chloride exiting the<br>
second leaching stage 2. When we speak later of alkali chloride for the sake<br>
of simplicity there is only mentioned sodium chloride, although some other<br>
alkali can be used in its place if necessary. Each leaching stage is presented<br>
as a single block, but it is clear that each stage generally consists of several<br>
reactors and thickening. In the copper concentrate leaching stages the<br>
copper dissolves into the process solution, and the solution is routed to<br>
thickening. After the first leaching stage thickening, the overflow solution 4<br>
contains copper chloride, in which there is about 70 g/l of mainly monovalent<br>
copper, and this is routed according to the Hydrocopper™ process to copper<br>
recovery (not shown in detail in the drawing). The leaching of the solids<br>
contained in underflow 5 is continued in the second leaching stage 2 with<br>
chloride solution 6. The chloride solution is formed from the sodium chloride<br>
solution which is obtained from chlorine alkali electrolysis belonging to the<br>
Hydrocopper™ process, and the copper (II) chloride solution, which is<br>
formed in oxidation stage 7 by oxidizing part of the copper (I) chloride 4<br>
formed in the first leaching stage.<br>
The solution 3 exiting the thickening of the second leaching stage 2 is routed<br>
to the first leaching stage 1 to leach the concentrate. Leaching of the residue<br>
8 exiting the second leaching stage is continued in a separate leaching stage<br>
9 to leach out the gold contained in it. The gold leaching stage 9 also<br>
generally takes place in several reactors, but for the sake of simplicity the<br>
whole stage is depicted as one unit. The precipitate in the gold leaching<br>
stage is leached with a concentrated solution of copper (II) chloride and<br>
sodium chloride 10, in which the Cu2+ concentration is 40-100 g/l and the<br>
sodium chloride concentration is 200 - 330 g/l and the amount of bromide<br>
calculated as bromine ions is 0.5 - 30 g/l. Oxygen is in addition routed into<br>
the leaching stage, which allows the oxidation-reduction potential of the<br>
solution to be raised to an adequate level for gold leaching i.e. a range of<br>
600-650 mV vs. Ag/AgCI electrode.<br>
The alkali bromide is preferably potassium or sodium bromide and in the<br>
early stage of leaching bromide is routed as a finely ground solid into the<br>
gold leaching stage. Since there is a closed circulation of solution in the gold<br>
leaching stage, the continuous addition of bromide is not required, and only<br>
the small amount that is consumed in the process is replaced subsequently<br>
with a bromide feed. The bromide feed shortens the gold leaching time,<br>
because the gold dissolved as a result of the bromide remains in solution<br>
and is not precipitated back. Gold also possibly dissolves as a bromide<br>
complex more easily than as a chloride complex.<br>
At the end of the gold leaching stage 9, solids separation is carried out. The<br>
overflow 11 that is formed is routed either as it is or filtered to gold recovery<br>
12, which takes place for instance by means of activated carbon in carbon<br>
columns. A gold product 13 is obtained from the columns. The solution<br>
removed from the columns is a gold-free solution 10, which is circulated back<br>
to the gold leaching stage 9. The thickening underflow from the gold recovery<br>
stage i.e. the precipitate, after normal further treatment such as filtration and<br>
washing 14 comprises the final residue 15, which includes almost all the<br>
sulphur of the concentrate and the majority of the iron. The residue filtrate<br>
and wash water 16 contains dissolved iron and a small amount of the<br>
bromide circulating in the gold leaching stage. The filtrate and wash water 16<br>
are routed to the oxidation stage 7 of the concentrate leaching process. The<br>
chlorine fed into the oxidation stage oxidises the bromide into bromine gas.<br>
The gas generated in the oxidation stage is routed to the gas scrubber<br>
belonging to the stage, where the bromine that is generated dissolves into<br>
the scrubber washing fluid. The scrubber washing fluid 17 is routed to the<br>
gold leaching stage, and the leaching stage slurry reduces the bromine back<br>
into bromide. This ensures that the bromide circulates only in this stage.<br>
The invention is described further by means of the attached examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
In a test a residue containing an average of 7g/t of gold, which was formed in<br>
the leaching of a raw material containing copper sulphide, was leached as a<br>
batch test. The residue was leached in batch tests in a 5-litre reactor, which<br>
was equipped with online electrodes for the measurement of pH and the<br>
oxidation-reduction potential. The tests were carried out at a temperature of<br>
95°C. The estimated gold leaching time was 30 - 40 h. At the start of<br>
leaching the pH was adjusted to a value of 2.0 by means of oxygen and<br>
hydrochloric acid feed, after which the pH was allowed to fall freely, but not<br>
below the value of 0.5. The pH should be below a value of 2.5 at the start of<br>
leaching too, to prevent the copper in the solution from precipitating as<br>
atacamite. During leaching the redox potential was raised gradually (over 5-8<br>
hours) to a value of 580 mV and subsequently 15 g/I of sodium bromide was<br>
added to improve gold leaching. The bromide addition was repeated at 10-<br>
hourly intervals and at that point the amount was 10 g/I. The results are<br>
depicted in diagram 2. The addition of bromide has a beneficial effect on the<br>
dissolving of gold particularly at lower potential levels. When there was<br>
sodium bromide in the solution, gold dissolved at a potential of 630 mV,<br>
which is an easy potential to achieve with a feed of oxygen.<br>
Example 2<br>
The effect of bromine in a continuous leaching circuit was tested in a<br>
laboratory pilot run. The gold circuit leaching circulation was not connected to<br>
the copper concentrate leaching circuit; only the copper-free solids from the<br>
copper concentrate leaching circuit were transferred to the gold leaching<br>
stage. There were two 5-litre leaching reactors in the gold leaching stage, in<br>
both of which were baffles, mixers and online electrodes for measurement of<br>
the pH and redox potential. The temperature of the leaching circuit in the<br>
leaching reactors was 95°C. The retention time of the solids in the reactors<br>
was 10-15 hours. The pH of the first leaching reactor was kept at a value of<br>
1.0 and the pH of the second reactor was 0.9. The redox potential in leaching<br>
was a maximum of 630 mV. The Cu2+ ion concentration of the solution was<br>
60 g/l and the NaCI concentration 250 g/l. The progress of leaching is<br>
depicted in diagram 3. 8 - 10 g/l of bromine was added to the gold circuit<br>
solution at point number 5. As the diagram shows, after the addition of<br>
bromine the gold concentration of the solution doubled.<br>
