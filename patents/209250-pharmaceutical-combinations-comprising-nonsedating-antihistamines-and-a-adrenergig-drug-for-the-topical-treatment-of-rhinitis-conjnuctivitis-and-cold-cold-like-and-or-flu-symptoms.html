Use of combinations comprising non-sedating antihistamines and  -adrenergic drugs for the topical treatment of rhinitis/conjunctivitis and cold, cold-like and/or flu symptoms<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates generally to novel pharmaceutical compositions containing , topical decongestants", preferably epinephrine, fenoxazoline, indanazoline, naphazoline, oxedrine, oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, tefazoline, tetryzoline, tramazoline, tymazoline or xylometazoline and a non-sedating antihistamine, applicable topically such as levocabastine, efletirizine, however preferably azelastine. The combinations are useful in the management of allergic and/or vasomotoric rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cold, cold-like and/or flu symptoms.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In industrialized countries, more than 10-15 % of the population suffer from alleraic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis. Allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis are type I allergic responses that are mediated by IgE antibodies. As a part of an allergic response to antigen, reaginic antibodies (IgE) are generated and bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils via high affinitiy Fc receptors (Fc RI) that are specific for IgE. Antigen cross-linking the lgE-molekules leads to cellular responses involving release of performed mediators (e.g. histamine), lipid mediator formation and release, and cytokine generation. Mast cells with their mediators can be regarded as central to the initiation and mediation of the early phase of allergic inflammation.<br>
Symptoms of rhinitis are sneezing, itching (nasal irritation), rhinorrhea (nasal secretion) and nasal blockage (congestion). Nasal blockage is the result of the pooling of blood in the capacitance vessels of the mucosa, and to some degree the result of tissue oedema. Patients with allergic conjunctivitis show similar symptoms.<br><br>
2<br>
Itching, eye rubbing and tearing are very common, and cause much distress. Conjunctival oedema and hyperemia cause the bulbar surface to take on a ,glassy" appearance, with dilated blood vessels.<br>
The common cold is usually not a serious illness but it is highly prevalent, discomforting, and annoying infliction. The term ,,common cold" is applied to minor upper respiratory illnesses caused by a variety of different respiratory viruses, in where rhinoviruses are the major known cause of common cold. Symptoms such as nasal discharge, nasal blockage, and sneezing usually commence on the first day of illness and progress to maximum severity by the 2nd and 3rd day. Along with nasal symptoms may come other symptoms such as cough, burning of the eyes, headache. Fever can also occur.<br>
Antihistamines are generally used in the symptomatic treatment of these disorders. They are effective in reducing itching, sneezing and watery secretion. Based on the ICAM-1(rhinovirus binding site) down-regulating effect of azelastine, it may be particularly useful in the treatment of common cold/flu. Antihistamines are, in general, less effective in the reduction of nasal congestion (blockage). To achieve a further reduction of nasal congestion and ocular oedema, a-adrenergic agonists are often used either alone or in combination with antihistamines.<br>
Non-sedating antihistamines especially such administered topically represent a new generation of histamine H1 receptor antagonists. They possess strong antagonistic activity at histamine H1 receptors without causing sedation. For example, azelastine, a phthalazinone derivative, belongs to this so-called second-generation, non-sedating antihistamines. It is characterized by a long-lasting antiallergic activity and shows a broad spectrum of pharmacologic activities including not only antagonism of histamine Hi-receptors but also inhibition of histamine release following antigen and non-antigen stimuli (Chand, N. et al. Inhibition of allergic and nonallergic leukotriene C4-formation and histamine secretion by azelastine: Implication for its mechanism of action. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 90:67-70, 1989). Recently, it has also been demonstrated that topically administered azelastine down-regulates ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion<br><br>
3<br>
molecule-1), the binding site for rhinoviruses (Ciprandi, M. D. et al. Topical azelastine reduces eosinophif activation and intraceilular adhesion molecule-1 expression on nasal cells: An antiallergic activity. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 98:1088-1096, 1996). Azelastine is free of cardiovascular side effects. Because the drug is administered topically, the plasma levels following topical azelastine application are extremely low, even if it is overdosaged. By contrast, oral formulations containing antihistamines of the second generation such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine may cause cardiovascular side effects (e.g. tachyarrhythmias) when the recommended dosage is not kept.<br>
With regard to allergic diseases and common cold, either topical or oral a-adrenergic agonists are used as disclosed in WO 94/ 08551. Oral decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine as disclosed in, for example, WO 92/ 04021, WO 92/ 04022, WO 94/ 08550, WO 94/14449 and WO 95/ 23591) carry the risk of inducing systemic adverse effects such as tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and CNS stimulation (e.g. insomnia). Topical a-adrenergic agonists such as epinephrine, fenoxazoline, indanazoline, naphazoline, oxedrine, oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, tefazoline, tetryzoline, tramazoline, tymazoline, xylometazoline are used as local decongestants in patients with allergic or vasomotor rhinitis, conjunctivitis or with upper respiratory infections (e.g. common cold, flu). a-Adrenergic drugs probably decrease resistance to airflow by decreasing the volume of the nasal mucosa. This may occur by activation of a-adrenergic receptors in venous capacitance vessels in nasal tissues. Topical decongestants are particularly useful because of their more selective site of action. Although their topical administration is associated with few systemic adversed effects, prolonged use may result in rebound congestion and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, the use of formulations containing a nasal vasoconstrictor compound is not recommended longer than 7-10 days. In addition, the recommended daily dosage should not be exceeded.<br>
For oral use, combinations containing antihistamines and a-adrenergic agonists are widely used both for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and common cold as disclosed in WO 88/ 09656, WO 94/14476, WO 94/ 25009 and WO 95/ 07103. It has been<br><br>
4<br>
demonstrated that patients suffering from common cold or allergic rhinitis have benefit from oral antihistamine + decongestant therapy (Anonymus. The management of hay fever. Drug Ther. Bull. 23:25-27, 1985; Berkowitz, R. B. et al. The effectiveness of the nonsedating antihistamine loratadine plus pseudoephedrine in the symptomatic management of the common cold. Ann. Allergy 63:336-339, 1989). Topical a-adrenergic agonists in combination with antihistamines are administered in which sedating antihistamines(e.g. antazoline) are used. Topical formulations containing antihistamines of the second generation and a-adrenergic agonists are not available and unknown at the moment Topical decongestants (a-adrenergic agonists) provide quick relief of nasal or ocular oedema. Therefore, they could improve the therapeutic effectiveness of topically applied antihistamines such as azelastine.<br>
Formulations for the treatment of cold, cold-like and/or flu symptoms often contain antihistamines and decongestants. Until now, only oral combination preparations are on the market. The therapeutic activity of a non-sedating antihistamine, applied topically as for instance azelastine, a histamine Hi-receptor antagonist can effectively be supported by a-adrenergic agonists without increasing the risk of adverse effects.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical combinations of matter, applicable topically, comprising an effective amount of a non-sedating antihistamine, preferably acrivastine, antazoline, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, efletirizine, epinastine, fexofenadine, loratidine, levocabastine, mizolastine, oxatomide, setastine, temelastine or terfenadine in combination with an a-adrenergic agonist, preferably epinephrine, fenoxazoline, indanazoline, naphazoline, oxedrine, oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, tefazoline, tetryzoline, tramazoline, tymazoline or xylometazoline and further optionally including pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluting agents or auxiliary substances therefor.<br><br>
