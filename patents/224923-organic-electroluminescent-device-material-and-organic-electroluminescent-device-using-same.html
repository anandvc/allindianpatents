ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE MATERIAL AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE USING SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescent ('electroluminescent" and 'electroluminescence" will be referred to as "EL". hereinafter) device material and an organic EL device using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a material for organic EL devices which utilizes emission of phosphorescent light, exhibits a great current efficiency and has a long lifetime and an organic EL device using tiie material.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An organic EL device is a spontaneous light emitting device which utilizes the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by energy of recombination of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is applied. Since an organic EL device of the laminate type driven under a low electric voltage was reported by C. W. Tang of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Volume 51, Pages 913, 1987), many studies have been conducted on organic EL devices using organic materials as the constituting materials. Tang et al. used a laminate structure using tris(8"hydroxyquinolinol)aluminum for the light emitting layer .and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer.    Advantages<br><br>
of the laminate structure are that the efficiency of hole injection into the light emitting layer can be increased, that the efficiency of forming excited particles which are formed by blocking and recombining electrons injected from the cathode can be increased, and -that excited particles formed within the light emitting layer can be enclosed. As the structure of the organic EL device, a two-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer and a three-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known. To increase the efficiency of recombination of injected holes and electrons in the devices of the laminate type, the structure of the device and the process for forming the device have been studied.<br>
As the light emitting material of the organic EL device, chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum, coumarine dei*ivatives. tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives and oxadiazole derivatives are known. It is reported that light in the visible region ranging from blue light to red light can be obtained by using these light emitting materials, and development of a device exhibiting color images is expected (refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. Heisei 8(l996)-239655, Heisei 7(l995M38561 and Heisei 3(l991)-200289).<br>
It is recently proposed that an organic phosphorescent materials is used in the light emitting layer of an organic EL device in combination with a light emitting material (for example, D. F. O'Brien, M. A. Baldo et al., "Improved energy transfer in electrophosphorescent devices*',. Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 74, No. 3, Pages 442 to 444, January 18, 1999; and M.<br><br>
A. Baldo et al., "Very high-efficiency green organic light-emitting devices based on electrophosphorescence", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 75, No. 1. Pages 4 to 6, July 5, 1999).<br>
As described above, a great efficiency of light emission is achieved by utilizing an organic phosphorescent material excited to the singlet state and the triplet state in the light emitting layer of an organic EL device. It is considered that singlet excimers and triplet excimers are formed in relative amounts of L3 due to the difference in the multiplicity of spin when electrons and holes are recombined in an organic EL device, Therefoz*e, it is expected that an efficiency of light emission 3 to 4 times as great as that of a device utilizing fluorescence alone can be achieved by utilizing a material emitting phosphorescent light.<br>
The organic EL device utilizing phosphorescent light emission is<br>
still under study, and an organic EL device exhibiting a great efficiency<br>
of light emssion and having a long lifetime is also being studied. As one<br>
of such studies, a device containing a phosphorescent emissive compound<br>
in the light emitting layer and emitting turquoise light at an external<br>
quantum efficiency of 10% is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 2002-100476. However, neither the efficiency of light<br>
emission nor the luminance of the device is mentioned in the specification<br>
of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-100476, and it is not<br>
known whether the device has the properties useful for practical<br>
applications.	Therefore,     an    organic    EL    device     utilizing    the<br>
phosphorescent light emission which exhibits an efficiency of light emission and a lifetime sufficient for practical applications has been desired.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems and has an object of providing an organic EL device which utilizes phosphorescent light emission, exhibits a great current efficiency and has a long lifetime.<br>
As the result of extensive studies by the present inventors to achieve the above object, it was found that an organic EL device which utilized phosphorescent light emission, exhibited a great efficiency of light emission and had a long lifetime could be obtained by using a compound having a specific condensed cyclic structure having nitrogen atom. The present invention has been completed based on this knowledge.<br>
The present invention provides a material for organic EL devices which comprises a compound represented by following general formula<br><br>

Examples of the compound represented by general formula (l) comprised in the material for organic EL devices of the present invention are - shown in the following. However, the material of the present invention is not limited to the compounds shown as the examples.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is preferable that the material for organic EL devices of the present invention comprising the compound represented by general formula (l) has an energy gap of the triplet state of 2.5 to 3.3 eV and more preferably 2.6 to 3.2 eV.<br>
It is preferable that the material for organic EL devices of the present invention comprising the compound represented by general formula (1) has an energy gap of the singlet state of 2.8 to 3.8 eV and more preferably 2.9 to 3.6 eV.<br>
The organic EL device comprises a cathode, an anode and an organic thin film layer which is sandwiched between the cathode and the anode and comprises at least one layer, and at least one layer in the organic thin film layer contains the material for organic EL devices comprising the material represented by general formula (l) described above.<br>
It is preferable that the light emitting layer, the electron transporting layer and/or the electron injecting layer or the hole transporting layer an/or the hole injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention contains the material for organic EL devices comprising the material represented by general formula (1) described above.<br>
It is preferable that the organic thin film layer in the organic EL device of the present invention contains a phosphorescent emissive compound. As the phosphorescent emissive compound, metal complexes emitting light by a multiplet excitation which is the excitation to the triplet state or higher are preferable. Examples of the metal complex include the following compounds-<br><br><br><br><br>
It is preferable that the material for organic EL devices is a host material of the organic EL device. The host material is a material into which holes and electrons can be injected and which has the function of transporting holes and electrons and emitting fluorescence by recombination of holes and electrons.<br>
The compound represented by general formula (1) in the present invention is useful also as the organic host material for phosphorescence devices since the energy gap of the singlet state is as great as 2.8 to 3.8 eV and the energy gap of the triplet state is as'great as 2.5 to 3.3 eV.<br>
The phosphorescence device is an organic device which comprises a substance emitting light based on the transition from the energy level in the triplet state to the energy level in the ground singlet state with a stronger intensity than those emitted from other substances, examples of which include phosphorescent substances such as organometallic complexes comprising at least one metal selected from Groups 7 to 11 of the Periodic Table, and emits light under an electric field utilizing the<br><br>
so-called phosphorescence.<br>
In the light emitting layer of the organic EL device, in general the singlet exciton and the triplet exciton are contained in the formed excited molecules as a mixture, and it is said that the triplet exciton is formed in a greater amount such that the ratio of the amount of the singlet exciton to the amount of the triplet exciton is 1-3. In conventional organic EL devices using the fluorescence, the exciton contributing to the light emission is the singlet exciton, and the triplet exciton does not emit light. Therefore, the triplet exciton is ultimately consumed as heat, and the light is emitted by the singlet exciton which is formed in a smaller amount. Therefore, in these organic EL devices, the energy transferred to the triplet exciton causes a great loss in the energy generated by the recombination of holes and electrons.<br>
In contrast, it is considered that, by using the material of the present invention for the phosphorescence device, the efficiency of light emission three times as great as that of a device using fluorescence can be obtained since the triplet exciton can be used for the emission of light. It is also considered that, when the compound of the present invention is used for the light emitting layer of the phosphorescence device, an excited triplet level in an energy state higher than the excited triplet level of a phosphorescent organometallic complex comprising a metal selected from the Group 7 to 11 of the Periodic Table contained in the layer, is achieved; the film having a more stable form is provided; the glass transition temperature is higher (Tg: 80 to 160°C): holes and/or electrons are efficiently transported; the compound is electrochemically and chemically stable; and the formation of impurities which may work as a trap or cause<br><br>
loss in the light emission is suppressed during the preparation and the use.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention comprises, as described above, a cathode, an anode and an organic thin film layer comprising at least one layer and sandwiched between the cathode and the anode. When the organic thin film layer comprises a single layer, a light emitting layer is formed between the anode and the cathode. The light emitting layer contains a light emitting material and may further contain a hole injecting material for transporting holes injected from the anode to the light emitting material or an electron injecting material for transporting electrons injected from the cathode to the light emitting material. It is preferable that the light emitting material exhibits a very excellent quantum yield, has a great ability of transporting both holes and electrons and forms a uniform thin layer. Examples of the organic EL device of the multi-layer type include organic EL devices comprising a laminate having a multi-layer structure such as (the anode / the hole injecting layer / the light emitting layer / the cathode), (the anode / the light emitting layer / the electron injecting layer / the cathode) and (the anode / the hole injecting layer / the light emitting layer / the electron injecting layer / the cathode).<br>
For the light emitting layer, in addition to the material comprising the compound represented by general formula (l) of the present invention, conventional host materials, light emitting materials, doping materials, hole transporting materials and electron transporting materials and combinations of these materials may be used in combination, where -necessary.    By using a multi-layer structure for the organic EL device,<br><br>
decreases in the luminance and the lifetime due to quenching can be prevented, and the luminance of emitted light and the efficiency of light emission can be improved with other doping materials. By using other doping materials contributing to the light emission of the phosphorescent light in combination, the luminance of emitted light and the efficiency of light emission can be improved in comparison with those of conventional devices.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the hole transporting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron transporting layer may each have a multi-layer structure. When the hole transporting layer has a multi-layer structure, the layer into which holes are injected from the electrode is called the hole injecting layer, and the layer which receives holes from the hole injecting layer and transports holes to the light emitting layer is called the hole transporting layer. Similarly, when the electron transporting layer has a multi-layer structure, the layer into which electron are injected from the electrode is called the electron injecting layer, and the layer which receives electrons from the electron injecting layer and transports electrons to the light emitting layer is called the electron transporting layer. The layers are selected in accordance with various properties such as the energy levels of the material, heat resistance and adhesion with the organic thin film layers and the metal electrodes.<br>

As the electrically conductive material used for the cathode, a material having a work function smaller than 4 eV is suitable, and magnesium, calcium, tin, lead, titanium, yttrium, lithium, ruthenium, manganese, aluminum and alloys of these metals are used.    However, the electrically conductive material<br><br>
used for the cathode is not limited to these materials.    Typical examples<br>
of    the     alloy    include     magnesium/silver,     magnesium/indium    and<br>
lithium/aluminum.    However, the allov is  not limited to these allovs.<br>
The composition of the alloy is controlled by the temperature of the source<br>
of vaporization, the atmosphere and the degree of vacuum, and a suitable<br>
composition is selected.    The anode and the cathode may be formed with<br>
a structure having two or more layers, where necessary.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention may comprise an<br>
inorganic compound layer between at least one of the electrodes and the<br>
above organic thin film layer.    Examples of the inorganic compound used<br>
for the inorganic compound layer include various types of oxides, nitrides<br>
and oxide nitrides such as alkali metal oxides, alkaline earth metal oxides,<br>

preferable since a stable interface layer of injection is formed.    As the component contacting the cathode, LiF, MgF2, CaF2, MgF2 and NaF are<br>
preferable.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable that at least one surface is sufficiently transparent in the region of the wavelength of the light emitted by the device so that the light emission is achieved efficiently. It is preferable that the substrate is also transparent.<br>
For the transparent electrode, the' conditions in the vapor deposition or the sputtering are set so that the prescribed transparency is<br><br>
surely obtained using the above electrically conductive material. It is<br>
preferable that the electrode of the light emitting surface has a<br>
trans mi ttance of lighr of 10% or greater. The substrate is not<br>
particularly limited as long as the substrate has the mechanical and<br>
thermal strength and is transparent. Examples of the substrate include<br>
glass substrates and transparent films of resins. Examples of the<br>
transparent film of a resin include films of polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl<br>

For the formation of each layer of the organic EL device of the present invention, any of the dry processes of film formation such as the vacuum vapor deposition, the sputtering, the plasma plating and the ion plating and the wet processes of film formation such as the spin coating, v the dipping and the flow coating, can be conducted. The thickness of each film is not particularly limited.    However, it is necessary that the<br><br>
thickness of the film be set at a suitable value. When the thickness is excessively great, application of a greater voltage is necessary to obtain the same output of the light, and the current efficiency decreases. When the thickness is excessively small, pin holes are formed, and sufficient light emission cannot be obtained even when an electric field is applied. In general, a thickness in the range of 5 nm to 10 urn is suitable and a thickness in the range of 10 nm to 0.2 jam is preferable.<br>
When the wet process of film formation is used, the material forming each layer is dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, and a thin film is formed from the obtained solution or suspension. Any of the above solvents can be used. For any of the layers, suitable resins and additives may be used to improve the property for film formation and to prevent formation of pin holes in the film. Examples of the resin which can be used include insulating resins such as polystyrene, polycarbonates, polyarylates, polyesters, polyamides, polyure thanes, polysulfones, polymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate, cellulose and copolymer resins derived from these resins; photoconductive resins such as polyN*vinylcarbazole and polysilanesJ and electrically conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrol. Examples of the additive include antioxidants, ultraviolet light absorbents and plasticizers.<br>
