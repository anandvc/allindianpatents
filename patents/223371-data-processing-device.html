				<td>DATA PROCESSING DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to devices, equipment and methods for distributing,<br>
billing and paying for digital media content.<br>
The Internet, as a global digital network, is extremely suitable for use as a<br>
technical platform for distributing digital data of content providers to their<br>
customers. Media content such as texts, audio content such as music or<br>
speech, images and moving video content are currently produced almost<br>
completely in digital form or can be digitized with little effort. By using highly<br>
developed compression techniques such as, for example, MP3 (for the audio<br>
field) or MPEG (for the video field), it is also possible to convey data-intensive<br>
content over the current Internet infrastructure, which still has a relatively<br>
narrow band at the consumer end. Software which is intended for use by the<br>
customer is also included within the digital content mentioned above in the<br>
context of the present invention.<br>
A provider of such multimedia content typically operates a particularly powerful<br>
computer, referred to as a server, which is continuously connected to the<br>
Internet via a broadband dedicated line. The customers of the content providers<br>
must respectively have access to a computer which is connected or can be<br>
connected to the Internet, for example to what is referred to as a personal<br>
computer (PC), and by using suitable Internet for example service protocols<br>
such as, in the simplest case, for example the "hypertext transport protocol"<br>
(HTTP) they download the data representing the content from the server onto<br>
the local computer (client). In this context, the digital content are frequently<br>
stored initially in the form of a file on the local computer before they can be<br>
used there. Alternatively, what are referred to as streaming protocols are<br>
available, in which the data representing the content is converted directly into<br>
perceptible sensory impressions during the download from the server<br>
computer to the client computer without a file which corresponds to the digital<br>
content being generated and stored on the client computer.<br>
For a long time not only fixed equipment in the form of a PC which is connected<br>
or can be connected to the Internet via lineâ€”bound transmission paths have<br>
been considered as client computers. Mobile equipment is available which can<br>
easily be carried on the person. Examples of this are compact playback devices<br>
(players), for example for MP3 audio files or for digital reading matter (e-<br>
books). Recently, equipment for converting digital content into perceptible<br>
sensory impressions which has a wirefree radio-frequency connection to the<br>
Internet, for example via mobile telephone networks such as GSM or UMTS,<br>
has also become known.<br>
Usually, different types of media are differentiated with respect to the technical<br>
devices and methods which are used to convert a digital content into a form<br>
which can be perceived by sensory means by the consumer. In the case of texts<br>
and images, including video sequences, the sense of sight is stimulated, and<br>
the terms "display devices" and "display methods" are used. In the case of audio<br>
media, which stimulate the sense of hearing, the terms "playback devices" and<br>
"playback methods" are used. Digital media can also stimulate other senses, in<br>
particular the sense of touch and the sense of smell. The subject matter of this<br>
invention relates, in its most general form, to the conversion of all these<br>
different types of media into a form which is suitable in a given situation for<br>
perception by the senses. The generally inventive aspects which are explained<br>
in the following text apply, despite specific expressions such as "display",<br>
"playback", "playing back" etc., basically to all forms of the consumption of<br>
media as long as they are not restricted expressly to specific types of media<br>
such as page-orientated items of text, for example. The use of software is also<br>
subsumed under this because even when software, for example a computer<br>
game or a piece of text processing software, runs the consumer interacts on the<br>
level of sensory perception. Despite this, it appears unavoidable that specific<br>
examples which are introduced for the sake of illustration will be restricted to<br>
specific types of media.<br>
There are unsolved problems with respect to billing and payment concepts for<br>
this type of modern distribution of digital content.<br>
Experience has shown that the first and fundamental question is whether the<br>
customer is at all willing to pay the respective content providers for the<br>
consumption of digital content via the Internet above and beyond the costs<br>
incurred for the actual Internet connection. The answer to this question<br>
depends essentially on the technical infrastructure required.<br>
For example, a company (MP3.COM) which is based in the United States offers<br>
a service which includes providing all Internet users with the possibility of<br>
downloading free of charge content in the form of audio files in the MP3 format,<br>
which originally could only be purchased as audio CDs (compact discs). The<br>
original concept originally included a control component which was such that<br>
the downloading of the MP3 audio file which was associated with a specific<br>
audio CD from a central server which was operated by the company was<br>
enabled for an individual customer only if this customer had previously trans-<br>
mitted a characteristic data sample of a corresponding audio CD to the server,<br>
the purpose of this being to prove that the respective customer had already<br>
purchased a copy of this CD and that the provision of a corresponding MP3<br>
audio file was covered by restricting provisions of copyright law. This approach<br>
cannot be considered promising for the future, for a number of reasons:<br>
1. On the one hand, at least for the United States, it has since become<br>
clear, as a result of court cases, that at least the original business model<br>
might not be covered by the qualifying provisions of U.S. copyright law.<br>
2. On the other hand, according to the theory of this business model, the<br>
flow of money from the consumer to the provider is still based on the<br>
sale of material goods, because the consumer should be able to obtain<br>
access to the server only by purchasing a corresponding audio CD. This<br>
must be considered a disadvantage in the age of the digital Internet<br>
economy.<br>
3. As a result of the fact that the MP3 audio files which are downloaded<br>
from the server represent, in extremely good quality, the items which<br>
were originally marketed on the audio CD, and furthermore can be<br>
distributed further over the Internet without a large degree of expen-<br>
diture and without a further loss in quality, there is an incentive for the<br>
customers of the company to make available themselves the<br>
downloaded MP3 audio files free of charge not only, for example, to<br>
close friends or relatives but also to the public at large. As a result, the<br>
service providers lose income as the MP3 audio files are distributed to a<br>
much wider public than the original purchasers of the audio CDs.<br>
4. Finally, the temporary possession of a suitable audio CD is not<br>
equivalent to legitimate ownership of this data carrier, i.e. it is not<br>
possible to exclude situations in which audio CDs are lent for a short<br>
time by the owner to third parties exclusively for the purpose of gaining<br>
access to the server.<br>
Possibly also in view of the shortcomings of the billing and payment concept of<br>
MP3.COM described above, another company, Napster Inc., which is based in<br>
the United States has developed another business model whose users are<br>
provided with access free of charge to, in particular, digital content which are<br>
present as MP3 audio files.<br>
In this concept (peerâ€”to-peer file sharing), there is no longer a central server<br>
for storing digital content; the MP3 audio files and other content are stored<br>
exclusively on the local client computers under the control of the customers of<br>
this company. The central Napster server provides merely the function of an<br>
intermediary, i.e. it receives requests from Napster customers for a specific<br>
digital content and then supplies the Internet address of client computers from<br>
which a corresponding file can be retrieved and downloaded. According to this<br>
system, it is only possible to retrieve what at least one Napster customer keeps<br>
ready for retrieval and downloading at a given point in time on a computer<br>
which is under his control. The original business concept is based on the idea<br>
that the noncommercial exchange of items which are protected by copyright<br>
among private individuals is covered by qualifying provisions of copyright law,<br>
it being assumed that the commercial intermediary activity by Napster does not<br>
infringe the noncommercial-private character of the distribution of digital<br>
content. In this case too, it now seems to have become clear that the business<br>
model does not comply at least with the qualifying provisions of U.S. copyright<br>
law.<br>
With the known peerâ€”to-peer concepts, there is no provision within the<br>
concepts for a flow of money from the consumer to the content provider. The<br>
owners of the copyrights of digital content have therefore experienced a<br>
significant deficiency in available technical concepts in order to be able to<br>
charge and collect appropriate payment even under the conditions of the<br>
Internet economy.<br>
In this context, technical approaches which basically wish to prevent peerâ€”toâ€”<br>
peer transactions on the Internet, for example at the level of the infrastructure<br>
of the Internet access providers through compulsory filtering of the Internet<br>
data streams, seem to be problematic. On the one hand, for political and legal<br>
reasons it is doubtful whether these concepts could be implemented on the<br>
necessary wide scale. On the other hand, new technical concepts for protecting<br>
the exchange of files through peer-to-peer transactions, including not least<br>
against legal or administrative intervention, are continuously being developed.<br>
An example of this is the peer-to-peer file transfer protocol "Gnutella" which,<br>
in contrast to the Napster concept, does not require a central server as inter-<br>
mediary. The ability to identify the client subscribers of such a protocol and the<br>
associated possibility of taking steps against the use of these technologies at a<br>
legal or administrative level are now being undermined by cryptographic<br>
anonymity techniques such as have been included in what is referred to as the<br>
"freenet" protocol.<br>
Adequate protection against unauthorized reproduction is a basic technical<br>
precondition for the possibility of sustained billing of a payment for the use of<br>
digital content by consumers. If this problem is not solved, economically viable<br>
billing does not appear possible.<br>
Cryptographic concepts which present themselves for this purpose are ones in<br>
which<br>
- files incorporating digital content are distributed both over the Internet<br>
and by means of physical data carriers such as CDs, exclusively in<br>
encrypted form, and/or<br>
- in which files incorporating digital content are provided with stegan-<br>
ographically concealed information, referred to as "watermarks", which<br>
provide information on the copyright status of the items contained in<br>
said files and which cannot be removed again from the files representing<br>
the digital content by the consumer by means of illegitimate technical<br>
manipulations.<br>
As a result of this approach, the cryptographic keys which are necessary to<br>
decrypt the files have to be effectively and reliably protected against any<br>
unauthorized access by third parties, in particular also access by consumers.<br>
This can be implemented particularly advantageously by content providers<br>
putting on the market, or having other interested companies put on the market,<br>
special equipment whose functional reliability the service provider trusts and in<br>
which, in particular, cryptographic keys are included, preferably for example in<br>
special sealed assemblies, in which suitable technical measures ensure that the<br>
cryptographic keys stored in them are deleted instantaneously as soon as an<br>
attempt at manipulation is detected.<br>
The embedding of watermarks in digital content does not, in itself, yet provide a<br>
sustained basis for a practical way of billing for the use of media by consumers.<br>
This also requires, on the part of the service provider, monitoring of the level of<br>
equipment by means of which consumers bring about the use of the digital<br>
content. In this context, the equipment whose functional reliability the service<br>
provider or providers trust is constructed in such a way that said equipment<br>
filters out the steganographically embedded copyright information and<br>
evaluates it in a suitable way in order to effectively prevent unauthorized use<br>
processes, in particular unauthorized reproduction.<br>
An example of such a technical infrastructure is known from the SDMI (Secure<br>
Digital Music Initiative) project.<br>
Generally, devices and methods which have the purpose of technically imple-<br>
menting the monopoly position, according to copyright law, of the copyright<br>
holder or his legal successor with respect to digital content are referred to as<br>
"Digital Rights Management Systems (DRMS)".<br>
Technical concepts for DRMS are known, for example, from US-A-6,112,181<br>
as well as from US-A-6,138,119.<br>
However, such a closed technical infrastructure with a DRMS which, on an<br>
effective and sustained basis, prevents the consumer from making any use of<br>
digital content which is not authorized by the content provider does not yet<br>
solve the problem of permitting as far as possible flexible distribution of, billing<br>
of and payment for digital content both over the Internet and by means of<br>
physical data carriers such as CDs.<br>
Nevertheless, in a method according to the invention for distributing, billing and<br>
paying for digital media content, as well as in a corresponding device, providing<br>
a connection to a DRMS which is cryptographically protected against misuse<br>
represents only one preferred form of implementation; such a cryptographically<br>
protected DRMS is not absolutely necessary.<br>
DRMS with which charge scheme information can be added to digital content<br>
by means of suitable technical concepts are known. For example, the XrML<br>
(Extensible rights Markup Language), which is based on XML (Extensible<br>
Markup Language) and whose specification can be obtained at<br>
http://www.xrml.org/, contains measures for configuring charge scheme infor-<br>
mation in a form which is suitable for data processing systems. However, such<br>
approaches still do not satisfactorily solve problems arising in the area of the<br>
technical execution of billing and payment processes.<br>
As things stand, such closed systems including a DRMS will gain acceptance on<br>
the market only if they also provide the consumer with perceptible advantages<br>
because the presence of the DRMS at first tends to be viewed as a hindrance by<br>
the consumer. However, it is also not at all the case that consumers would not<br>
be prepared to pay charges to the content provider for the use of digital<br>
content; what is significant is rather the fact that the modalities of the billing and<br>
payment processes do not correspond to customers' wishes. In this respect,<br>
there are considerable shortcomings with the present state of the art.<br>
One of the problems of previous technical systems for distributing, billing and<br>
paying for digital content has been that they are based on concepts of a<br>
purchasing charge scheme or subscription charge scheme which are too<br>
inflexible.<br>
For example, systems are known in which, for example by means of credit card<br>
payment, it is necessary to pay a full purchase price before a file constituting a<br>
digital content can be downloaded from a server. This leads in particular to a<br>
situation in which previous freeâ€”ofâ€”charge viewing of the digital content by<br>
the consumer to determine whether it is suitable, pleases him and so on and so<br>
forth is no longer possible. This presents a considerable barrier to the acqui-<br>
sition of a digital content by purchasing as if the customer is not satisfied it is<br>
generally impossible to reverse the purchase since, in contrast to, for example,<br>
the purchase of a physical book or a CD, it is very difficult reliably to rescind<br>
from the consumer the relevant right of disposal over the file which has been<br>
supplied to him as a copy.<br>
On the other hand, systems are known which permit use-dependent distri-<br>
bution of, billing of and payment for digital content using the "video on demand"<br>
method. However, such systems have the disadvantage that the detailed nature<br>
of the billing process is associated with the presence of a data link between the<br>
terminal (client) and a server of the content provider. Although the costs for<br>
data transmission using modern telecommunications equipment are continu-<br>
ously dropping, it is currently unrealistic to assume that when consumers use<br>
digital content they will always have uninterrupted and secure access to<br>
telecommunications networks at low cost.<br>
An important social aspect relating to the use of media is the option of the<br>
consumer to be able to act anonymously when acquiring media, for example by<br>
purchasing physical media for cash payment at a kiosk. Known digital distri-<br>
bution, billing and payment concepts using data traffic networks such as the<br>
Internet in particular are based on the possibility of identifying the individual<br>
consumers. There is a need for an improved technical infrastructure for distrib-<br>
uting, billing and paying for digital content in which the consumer can also act<br>
anonymously.<br>
It is known that both the market for digital content and the market for technical<br>
equipment with which digital content can be presented to the consumer in the<br>
form of sensory perceptions are characterized by a level of competition which is<br>
giving rise to a wide variety of different technical embodiments of this technical<br>
infrastructure. However, for the customer it is a significant disadvantage if this<br>
diversity also gives rise to a large number of billing and payment systems. In<br>
practice, the result of this diversity is that the consumer is expected to enter<br>
into numerous individual contracts with providers of payment systems, for<br>
example credit card companies, companies for mobile-radio -based payment<br>
systems and others. The level of acceptance of technical infrastructures for the<br>
controlled distribution of, billing of and payment for digital content is percep-<br>
tively reduced by these disadvantages.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to specify a device and a method for<br>
distributing, billing and paying for digital content in which the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages are diminished or overcome and in which, in particular, a more<br>
finely detailed billing process is possible without a permanent data link to a<br>
billing server, for example.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by means of the features of<br>
the independent patent claims. Advantageous refinements of the invention are<br>
contained in the subclaims which are respectively referred back to said claims.<br>
The solution according to the invention permits an improved technical infra-<br>
structure for the distribution of, billing of and payment for digital content, which<br>
infrastructure permits the implementation of a partial or total departure from the<br>
rigid connection between the use of media and the purchase of material data<br>
carriers such as CDs, DVDs or video cassettes. According to the principles of<br>
the conventional use of media, the consumer acquires, through a purchasing<br>
transaction, a single copy of a physical data carrier with content recorded on it,<br>
and he can use said copy at his own discretion:<br>
- on the one hand, this approach leads to a situation in which the full<br>
purchase price is charged even if the consumer uses only a part of the<br>
content stored on the data carrier.<br>
- In addition, the distribution of media content through the sale and<br>
marketing of physical copies requires complex and costly logistics for<br>
the manufacture, storage and retailing of the data carriers.<br>
- However, on the other hand, the physical nature of the data carriers<br>
permits the billing of the charges to be paid by the consumer to be<br>
handled comparatively easily, provided that the uncontrolled duplication<br>
of the data carriers is sufficiently unattractive for the consumer, for<br>
example in view of the effort involved in making copies or in view of<br>
unavoidable decreases in quality levels such as inevitably occur when<br>
analog copies are made of content on audio or video cassettes.<br>
Although the high transaction costs due to the physical nature of data carriers<br>
are automatically eliminated by the changeover to the nonphysical distribution<br>
of digital content over data networks, at the same time any possibility of distin-<br>
guishing between the "original" of a file representing digital content, which was<br>
legitimately acquired through a purchasing transaction, and copies, which were<br>
manufactured virtually without effort or without incurring costs, is lost. When<br>
files are distributed digitally over data traffic networks such as, in particular, the<br>
Internet, the distinction between "original" and "copy" no longer makes any<br>
sense whatsoever.<br>
The solution according to the invention is therefore based on the approach that<br>
in a digital economy the purchase of copies of a file representing digital<br>
content, with the subsequent right of disposal of the consumer acquiring the<br>
copy, which right follows logically from the purchase, must be replaced or at<br>
least supplemented by the concept of the granting (generally for payment) of<br>
rights of access and use ("access rights") to the consumer, who however is as a<br>
result no longer able to exert the relevant right of disposal over a data carrier<br>
which is typical of its possession.<br>
As a result of this paradigm change away from purchase and ownership and<br>
toward temporary granting of rights of access and use,<br>
- on the one hand a solution is provided to the problem that files which<br>
represent digital content can be copied at will since a suitably configured<br>
technical infrastructure means that the possession of ("original") files by<br>
the consumer is no longer decisive for the use process; whereas in fact<br>
in the context of the solution according to the invention the files as such<br>
can in principle be copied and distributed at will by the consumer<br>
without adversely affecting the interests of the owners of the rights,<br>
according to the inventive solution, only the critical access-rights infor-<br>
mation which is necessary to use the content of the files now in turn has<br>
to be kept strictly under control using technical means;<br>
- on the other hand, the risk arising from the dependence of the consumer<br>
on the continued granting of rights of access and rights of use by the<br>
service providers potentially becomes greater because, in contrast to the<br>
conventional model of purchasing and ownership, the model of access<br>
and use is based on the assumption that the consumer can continue to<br>
have access to a service provider who is willing, ready and also actually<br>
able to provide the service to which the customer is entitled on the basis<br>
of rights of access and use. If the service provider, for whatever reasons,<br>
closes down his business or discontinues marketing a specific content,<br>
for example for economic reasons or in response to external pressure,<br>
the consumer is no longer able to access his acquired copy, which he<br>
has taken into his possession and archived, for continued consumption<br>
and use, something which would be possible with the purchasing and<br>
possession model.<br>
The solution according to the invention therefore provides, in particular, a<br>
technical infrastructure with which a concept of access and use is made<br>
technically possible as a replacement of, or supplement to, the purchasing and<br>
possession model:<br>
The aspect of integrating a card module into a solution according to the<br>
invention as explained in more detail below also makes it possible to synthesize<br>
"use" and "possession" as the right of use can be tied to a physical object which<br>
is difficult to duplicate and furthermore incorporates for the consumer in a<br>
perceptible form the rights of use which are transferred to him.<br>
By virtue of the advantages of the solution according to the invention it is<br>
possible to make charge-incurring concepts for the use of digital concepts by<br>
the consumer more attractive in comparison with free-of-charge file sharing<br>
facilities as the consumer is provided with more than just a file which incorpo-<br>
rates a digital content:<br>
- on the one hand, a uniform quality standard is ensured, i.e. in contrast to<br>
noncommercial free-of-charge file sharing facilities, the consumer<br>
does not need to allow for files which have been conditioned in a<br>
technically inadequate way, and<br>
- by virtue of the concept - explained in more detail below - of the status<br>
rights and its technical implementation, it is possible, at the commercial<br>
level, to configure products which provide the consumer with attractive<br>
added features, above and beyond the file which represents the digital<br>
content.<br>
Technical portal solution<br>
A first aspect in conjunction with the invention is that the distribution of, billing<br>
of and payment for digital media content can be carried out for a large number<br>
of content providers and for a large number of consumers by means of one<br>
technical portal data processing device. In particular, wide area networks (WAN)<br>
can be used both by content providers to load files constituting digital content<br>
onto the portal data processing device, and also by the consumer to download<br>
said files from this portal data processing device. Here, in particular two<br>
embodiments are provided:<br>
- selective individual transmission of specific content "on demand" from<br>
the portal data processing device to a specific device which is operated<br>
at the consumer end, and<br>
- nondirected transmission of specific content by "broadcast" techniques<br>
from the portal data processing device to a nonspecific number of<br>
devices operated by a set of consumers.<br>
The, portal data processing device can also manage rights of access and use<br>
and collect billing data from the devices which are operated by the consumers,<br>
and on the basis of this billing data it can perform the billing both of the charges<br>
for use which are to be paid by the individual consumers as well as the billing of<br>
the royalties to be paid to the individual content providers. Finally, the portal<br>
data processing device can also carry out the corresponding payment<br>
processes.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the portal data processing device is operated in<br>
a mode in which content of numerous owners of rights are marketed jointly:<br>
- on the one hand, the consumer is spared the need to enter into a<br>
number of individual contracts with owners of rights; all that is<br>
necessary is a single global contract with the portal operator.<br>
- On the other hand, the portal data processing system can be set up to<br>
be a content archive for all the files with digital content which have ever<br>
been marketed, as a result of which the portal operator is placed, in<br>
comparison with the consumer, in a position of assuming a type of<br>
"guarantor position" with respect to the further availability of the service<br>
which is associated with the right of access and use. Even if the owner<br>
of the right has dispensed with a certain content and does not wish to<br>
continue managing and archiving the respective files (referred to as<br>
"abandonwave"), the consumer can be provided with a consideration, in<br>
accordance with his rights of access and use, via the portal data<br>
processing device.<br>
The portal data processing device can also be configured in such a way that it<br>
can be operated as a component of "Peer-To-Peer" file sharing facilities. In<br>
such a context, the files which incorporate digital content are held available for<br>
retrieval on, for example, client computers which are operated by the<br>
consumer. The management of rights of access and use and the functions<br>
relating to the billing and payment then typically remain with the portal data<br>
processing device.<br>
Offline mode<br>
A second aspect relating to the invention consists in the fact that the billing<br>
and/or the payment of charges which have been incurred for the use of digital<br>
content does not necessarily need to be configured so as to be synchronous<br>
with the use process itself. That is to say, depending on the credit policy of<br>
content providers or billing companies, the consumer can be allowed to use the<br>
digital content to a specific degree by means of a suitable device according to<br>
the invention without there having to be an uninterrupted data traffic<br>
connection to some form of billing center, in particular to the portal data<br>
processing device, during this time. For this purpose, during a time interval<br>
between two billing times, all the necessary data relating to the use behavior of<br>
the consumer is collected locally in order to be able to use it at the next billing<br>
time as the basis for billing the contractually liable charge for use. This recorded<br>
data is preferably secured, using suitable technologies, against unauthorized<br>
manipulations, in particular by the consumer. It is possible to provide for the<br>
consumer to have to make a deposit in order to cover the credit risk from<br>
processes of the use of digital content which are to be billed later. It is<br>
preferable to have a system in which the risk for the content provider or the<br>
billing company is limited by the fact that a further use of digital content is<br>
prevented if the sum to be paid which has been run up exceeds a specific<br>
threshold value. Further use of the digital content is not enabled again until<br>
billing and payment have taken place.<br>
Card module<br>
A third aspect of the invention is that preferably an exchangeable, module-like<br>
element, for example a chipcard or a flash memory module, can be used in<br>
particular for storing identity information, billing information and payment<br>
information.<br>
This module does not necessarily need to be embodied as a card; it is also<br>
possible to use other forms, for example ones which are suitable for<br>
attachment, for example sewing in or bonding in, to items of clothing.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, the term "card module" will be used below; however,<br>
other forms are also to be expressly considered as included in this.<br>
The card module has an interface by means of which it can exchange data with<br>
other devices, in particular with a piece of equipment which is suitable and<br>
designed for making digital content perceptible to the consumer by sensory<br>
means, said piece of equipment being referred to below as "use equipment".<br>
This data transmission may take place, for example, in a lineâ€”bound fashion, by<br>
means of electrical plug-type connectors, contact fields or connection lines.<br>
Likewise, the transmission of data can take place in a wirefree fashion by means<br>
of a radio link, for example according to the Bluetooth standard, or by magnetic<br>
induction or visually, for example using an infrared connection according to the<br>
IrDA standard.<br>
A card module can advantageously be used in conjunction with the solution<br>
according to the invention<br>
- for the distribution of digital content, for example by storing item-<br>
specific address information, i.e. reference information about network<br>
paths via which digital content can be accessed, or by storing the files<br>
representing digital content on the card module;<br>
- for billing by storing billing-related data on the card module, and<br>
- for payment by storing data on the card module which relates to the<br>
payment method and the payment path.<br>
Using a card module also facilitates, in particular, contract bundling as the card<br>
module can be used in conjunction with a number of individual pieces of<br>
equipment for which otherwise it would be necessary to conclude separate<br>
contracts for use and payment.<br>
DRMS<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention is that all the files which incorporate digital<br>
content are preferably distributed in encrypted form. As a result, it is possible,<br>
in conjunction with a cryptographic DRMS, to effectively prevent unauthorized<br>
use of digital content. With respect to the use of a cryptographic DRMS it is<br>
necessary to store the key or keys, the cryptographic keys which are necessary<br>
for lawfully decrypting the files representing digital content, in a suitable<br>
technical way so that the consumer can use the content which have been<br>
distributed in encrypted form. In this context, when a card module is used, two<br>
cases are to be differentiated:<br>
- when a card module is used, the multimedia items can, on the one hand,<br>
be encrypted in a decoder-specific way, not in a card-specific way, i.e.<br>
the card is used for providing authorization with respect to the decoder,<br>
whereas the data of the files representing the digital content to be used<br>
is decrypted by the use device by means of cryptographic decryption<br>
keys stored in the decoder, and is converted into a form which can be<br>
perceived by the senses. In this context, the card module preferably<br>
provides authentication for itself to the use device by means of suitable<br>
cryptographic protocols using the data transmission interface.<br>
- When a card module is used, the multimedia items can, on the other<br>
hand, be encrypted in a cardâ€”specific way, not in a decoderâ€”specific<br>
way, i.e. the card is used to store the cryptographic decryption keys<br>
which are necessary to decrypt the digital content, it being possible to<br>
transmit these decryption keys to the decoder via an adequately secured<br>
data transmission link. The data of the files representing the digital<br>
content to be used can then be decrypted by the use device by means of<br>
the cryptographic decryption keys which are transmitted by the card<br>
module, and converted into a form which can be perceived by the<br>
senses.<br>
Flexible charge scheme models<br>
A fifth aspect of the invention is that the consumer of digital content is regis-<br>
tered in a finely detailed way and billed fairly. This means in particular that a<br>
possible way is provided of enabling the consumer to pay a charge to the<br>
content provider only for those portions of multimedia items which he has also<br>
actually used. If only a part of a multimedia item is used, it is possible to provide<br>
a charge scheme which also demands only a part of the charge which was set<br>
for use of the entire item. Here, a distinction is made between<br>
- an item-specific item charge level in which the billing is carried out<br>
independently of the device according to properties of the item, and<br>
- an equipmentâ€”specific equipment charge level in which the billing is<br>
carried out independently of the item according to properties of the<br>
equipment, and<br>
hybrid charge level structures composed of an item charge level and<br>
equipment charge level in which, for example, a higher charge can be<br>
demanded for an item if it is used on a piece of equipment which<br>
permits better presentation quality (larger screen, better sound quality or<br>
the like).<br>
Basic instruments for the item charge level are<br>
- timeâ€”specific billing, for example listening time used in the case of<br>
audio content;<br>
- volumeâ€”specific billing, for example the number of pages of a page-<br>
oriented text content which have been used;<br>
- hybrid billing models, for example volumeâ€”oriented billing which is<br>
modified to have portions with a timeâ€”specific charge scheme, in the<br>
case of a page-oriented text content.<br>
For example, the charge for use which is provided for use of half of the volume<br>
of a digital content could be set at half the charge provided for use of the entire<br>
content. In the case of a digital content in the form of a text item (book),<br>
measurement could be carried out for example by reference to the pages used<br>
in relation to the overall number of pages. However, other nonlinear charge<br>
scheme models are also possible. In addition, this makes it possible to differ-<br>
entiate as to whether the consumer would like to use a multimedia item as<br>
often as desired, like a conventional purchased item, once payment has been<br>
made on a single occasion or whether limitation of the use processes in terms<br>
of number, for a significantly reduced charge, is considered. It is also possible,<br>
for example in the case of a text item, to determine the charge as a function of<br>
how often its individual pages of text have been used by the consumer.<br>
If the charge for the use of a page-oriented text item is calculated exclusively<br>
per page-display process, there is a serious disadvantage that the intuitive<br>
search process of "leafing through" is billed in an extremely costly way for the<br>
consumer as in this process a large number of pages may possibly be<br>
displayed in a short time without the consumer actually having been able to use<br>
the respective page content, as is assumed in this charge scheme model. If, on<br>
the other hand, the charge for the use of a page-oriented text item is calcu-<br>
lated purely as a function of time, a slow reader would be unacceptably disad-<br>
vantaged as a consumer in comparison with a fast reader. An advantageous<br>
complex charge scheme model can provide, in particular, one predetermined<br>
page-related charge per page displayed and a predetermined orientation time<br>
is fixed, it being assumed that a page cannot be absorbed by the reader until<br>
this time has expired. This permits a nondiscriminatory leafing function.<br>
Furthermore, each page can be assigned a predetermined reading time, after<br>
the expiry of which it is assumed, in terms of the charge scheme, that the<br>
consumer will have been able to completely absorb the page content provided.<br>
If the time period for which a specific page is presented on the display consis-<br>
tently after the expiry of the orientation time is shorter than the predetermined<br>
reading time, the system acts, for example, as if the reader had only used a<br>
proportion of the content which corresponds to the ratio of the actual display<br>
time, in excess of the orientation time, to the predetermined reading time. For<br>
the remaining (residual) proportion of the reading time, the reader is assigned a<br>
time credit, i.e. if the consumer displays the same page again, a renewed page<br>
use charge is demanded of him, once a new orientation time has expired, only<br>
if the credited residual proportion time has expired. It is also possible to collect<br>
all the time credits which have arisen due to premature termination of the<br>
reading of a page in a user-specific time credit account. Further pages can<br>
 then be considered free of charge from this account.<br>
In the case of equipment charge levels, in particular time-dependent enabling<br>
charge levels are possible in which, for example, a specific individual piece of<br>
equipment is enabled for the use of any desired items for 24 hours.<br>
Even if the represented aspect relates to a technical infrastructure which<br>
permits fair and finely graduated billing for the use of digital content by the<br>
consumer, this of course does not preclude charge schemes which are based<br>
on flat rates. This applies both to unit charge levels and to equipment charge<br>
levels.<br>
Billing<br>
A sixth aspect of the invention is that the use of the digital content is billed on<br>
the basis of the charge scheme models. For billing, a specific amount to be paid<br>
by the consumer in a currency which is recognized as a payment means or a<br>
fraction or a multiple of other value units is determined on the basis of the<br>
details of the use actions performed by the consumer, on the basis of the<br>
respectively applicable charge scheme model. For billing, in particular two<br>
secondary aspects are significant:<br>
- on the one hand, it is possible to prepare, for the consumer, an invoice-<br>
like listing of the use processes of digital content which he has carried<br>
out, for example, in a billing period, from which the consumer can see<br>
how the final amount is made up.<br>
- On the other hand, it is possible to produce, for the content providers, a<br>
listing indicating how often, and if appropriate also at what charge<br>
levels, specific parts of their digital content have been used, and what<br>
overall charge to be paid to the content provider was calculated on this<br>
basis.<br>
Consequently, the solution according to the invention makes it possible to<br>
provide a billing service for the use of digital content not only for the consumer<br>
but also for the content providers in a fact-based fashion and without flat rates.<br>
Status rights<br>
A seventh aspect of the invention is the storage of data features corresponding<br>
to status and priority rights ("privileges") which the consumer can acquire by<br>
completing use processes which are made possible and billed using the card. It<br>
is possible, for example, to provide for the user to be able to use for free those<br>
pages of a text item which he has used sufficiently often on a charge-paying<br>
basis in the past. It is also possible to provide for the consumer to be allowed<br>
discounts as a function of previously executed use processes. Status rights may<br>
be allocated, in particular, on the following level:<br>
- Consumerâ€”specific status rights, i.e. specific status rights are tied to the<br>
identity of the consumer or, if appropriate, to a pseudonym identity of<br>
the consumer, but not to a specific, digital content ("item"). An example<br>
of this category of status rights are the turnover sums which have been<br>
incurred in total in the past and which can be used, for example, as the<br>
basis for a discount.<br>
- Consumer-related, item-specific status rights, i.e. these status rights<br>
are tied simultaneously both to the identity of the consumer or to his<br>
pseudonym identity and to a file which represents a digital content<br>
("item"). An example of this category of status rights is an item-specific<br>
statement that a particular consumer has already used a particular<br>
page-orientated text item so extensively that according to the charge<br>
scheme he is now given the right to use this text item without further<br>
restrictions and without further billing of use actions.<br>
- Item-specific status rights which are tied to consumers can also be tied<br>
to a group of items, for example all items which are marketed by a<br>
specific content provider, for example by a specific publishing house.<br>
- Substatus rights which are tied to the consumer and to an item. These<br>
status rights are tied not only to the identity or pseudonym identity of a<br>
specific consumer but also to a specific part of an item. An example of<br>
this category of status rights is the right assigned to a specific consumer<br>
of being able to use, with respect to the use of a specific page-oriented<br>
text item, specific individual pages of the item without additional subse-<br>
quent billing as a maximum charge, according to the charge scheme,<br>
has already been paid for the use of these pages in the past.<br>
Status rights respectively form the basis for a claim, by the consumer to which<br>
they pertain, to a specific service which, depending on the circumstances of the<br>
individual case, may have to be provided, for example, by the content provider<br>
or by the operator cf the portal data processing device. The possible service in<br>
this context is, in particular:<br>
- the payment of sums of money or other value units, if appropriate also<br>
when setting them off against existing charges arising from other use<br>
processes which have already been carried out or are to be carried out<br>
in the future by the consumer;<br>
- free-of-charqe use of specific digital content with or without time<br>
restrictions;<br>
- discount for other media consumption actions by the consumer, for<br>
example for cinema visits, visits to festivals etc., in which case in<br>
particular various forms of marketing of one and the same item can be<br>
combined, for example when a discount is given for a conventional book<br>
purchase if the film associated with the book has been consumed<br>
digitally by means of the solution according to the invention;<br>
- provision of a physical data carrier with specific digital items, for<br>
example a CO-ROM with a specific music title if said item has been<br>
consumed a sufficient number of times (i.e. at least one predetermined<br>
number of processes) in return for payment using the solution according<br>
to the invention.<br>
The acquisition of status rights by means of a consumption history can<br>
- take place offline, i.e. the device operated at the consumer end deter-<br>
mines, from the consumption data, the status rights accruing to the<br>
consumer by direct reference to the consumption history, or<br>
- take place online, i.e. the portal data processing device does not<br>
determine the status rights accruing to the consumer until after the<br>
consumption history of the consumer has been transmitted from the<br>
device operated by the consumer to the portal data processing device.<br>
In this variant, there is the advantage that the consumer is motivated to<br>
make an online connection for the transmission of the consumption<br>
history as frequently as possible.<br>
Payment method<br>
An eighth aspect ot the invention is that, on the one hand, the payment of the<br>
incurred charges can be adapted to known payment systems which have been<br>
introduced onto the market, but on the other hand the payment is preferably<br>
possible by means of technical measures both<br>
- anonymously, i.e. without knowledge of the identity of the consumer<br>
and without the possibility of being able to link a plurality of media use<br>
processes by accessing a pseudonym,<br>
- pseudonymously, i.e. without knowledge of the identity of the<br>
consumer, but with the possibility, by accessing a pseudonym, of being<br>
able to link a plurality of media use processes, as well as<br>
- with all the details about the identity of the consumer being revealed, i.e.<br>
with the name and address of the consumer being revealed.<br>
Within the scope of the solution according to the invention it is possible to<br>
provide, in particular, for:<br>
- payment on a credit basis, i.e. the consumer must store an amount of<br>
money before the consumption actions are accepted, no further use<br>
being made possible, through technical disabling means, as soon as the<br>
credit has been used up, or<br>
- payment in arrears, i.e. the content provider or the operator of the portal<br>
data processing device provides an advance performance by permitting<br>
the consumer to use his service without previously storing a credit, the<br>
consumer having to pay after billing has been performed.<br>
- Also in the case of payment on an arrears basis it is possible to provide<br>
for a technical disabling means to prevent further use actions on the part<br>
of the consumer when a specific amount for payment in arrears is<br>
outstanding.<br>
In principle, the processing of the payment can be performed using conven-<br>
tional channels such as a credit card, debit note or bank transfer. However, a<br>
variant of the solution according to the invention in which the payment process<br>
is performed by interacting with a card module (see the third aspect above)<br>
proves particularly advantageous. In this context, the data relating to the<br>
payment path which has been agreed with the consumer can be stored digitally<br>
on the card module and used by applying online payment techniques.<br>
Appliances with reduced complexity<br>
A ninth aspect of the invention is the use of use devices (appliances) with<br>
reduced complexity in order to make digital content perceptible by the senses<br>
of the consumer. For some time, data processing devices which have been<br>
interconnected by the Internet or other telecommunications systems have been<br>
used not only by companies but also by end users for participating in "e-<br>
commerce" in order to carry out commercial transactions of all types.<br>
The use of the Internet and of other telecommunications systems such as, for<br>
example, proprietary online systems by the end user is almost always carried<br>
out using a personal computer, also referred to as PC, or a comparable piece of<br>
equipment, for example a workstation, of a portable computer (notebook) or of<br>
a piece of mini equipment which is to be held in the hand (palmtop).<br>
Personal computers and such comparable pieces of equipment have the<br>
advantage that the scope of functionality which can be made available by them<br>
to the end user is not determined solely by the hardware used but also can be<br>
changed in an extremely flexible way by loading various programs at any<br>
desired time. For example, it is possible subsequently to download and install a<br>
specific piece of software if the end user wishes to use additional function-<br>
alities.<br>
The disadvantage of this universality is the burgeoning complexity of PCs or<br>
workstations which are equipped with customary operating systems such as<br>
Windows or Unix. The end user must firstly acquire a considerable amount of<br>
background knowledge about the structure and the functional relationships of<br>
the complex overall system in order to be able to use in a practical way the<br>
potential universality provided in said system, in order to carry out specific<br>
tasks.<br>
It becomes apparent that considerable groups of end users or prospective end<br>
users do not wish to use, or cannot use, telecommunication services, in<br>
particular for the purposes of e-commerce, because they are not capable of<br>
mastering the complexity of PCs or comparable pieces of equipment whose use<br>
has hitherto been de facto a necessary precondition for participation in or use<br>
of telecommunication services.<br>
The technical problems which occur for the end user with conventional data<br>
processing devices are varied. They generally start with the fact that it is<br>
necessary not only to set up the operating system but also to configure and<br>
finally establish a link to a telecommunication system, for example the Internet.<br>
The modalities of the access to the Internet here vary, inter alia, locally<br>
depending on the country or region and also from provider to provider at the<br>
same location.<br>
Finally, once a networked data processing device which is capable of use has<br>
been obtained, the end user is presented, for example on the Internet, with an<br>
unstructured profusion of offers for commercial activity. In conventional data<br>
processing devices, the end user himself has to work through and acquire<br>
extensive knowledge from references in order to be able to use the offers which<br>
are of interest to him via the telecommunications network.<br>
Finally, if the end user has found a provider with which he wishes to establish a<br>
stronger business connection, it is generally necessary to take into account<br>
numerous particular features for each provider relating to the identification and<br>
the authentication of the customer as well as the delivery of the ordered goods<br>
and the processing of payments.<br>
In view of this problem, it has previously been suggested to provide extremely<br>
specialized data processing devices which are capable of providing only a<br>
single functionality or at most a small number of functionalities. An example of<br>
this is the mobile phone which is a data processing device which is connected<br>
to a telecommunications network and which serves essentially only a single<br>
purpose, namely making a telephone call. However, restriction to a single<br>
functionality per type of equipment proves cumbersome given the increasing<br>
significance of networked data processing devices since the number of different<br>
types of equipment required for the various use areas increases too much.<br>
When there is an increase in the number of functionalities per piece of<br>
equipment using conventional procedures, for example by adding text message<br>
calling to a mobile telephone, a level of complexity in terms of the operator<br>
control of the piece of equipment which acts as a deterrent for wide groups of<br>
users is again reached quickly.<br>
An important field of application of e-commerce relates to the distribution of<br>
files which may include data processing programs, texts, diagrams, multimedia<br>
items or video animations to customers by content providers. In this field of<br>
application there is the particular feature that the exchange of performances<br>
between the content provider and the customer can take place in a completely<br>
virtual fashion as both the catalogue of goods and services, the ordering<br>
process, the delivery of the ordered goods and the billing can be processed in<br>
the form of data which is exchanged via telecommunications devices. A disad-<br>
vantage of previous approaches to solutions for distributing items is that the<br>
customer generally has to acquire a copy of the item as a purchased item even<br>
if he only wishes to use it for a brief time or only wishes to use parts of it.<br>
The invention therefore relates to a technical infrastructure which is suitable for<br>
such purposes.<br>
Telecommunications cards<br>
A tenth aspect of the invention is the approach in which the technical infra-<br>
structure according to the invention for distributing, billing and paying for digital<br>
media content, including a card module in conjunction with SIM cards and<br>
similar devices, is implemented in mobile communications radio networks, for<br>
example GSM or UMTS. As a result, the functionality of a telecommunications<br>
card can advantageously be combined with the functionality of multimedia<br>
consumption by virtue of the fact that the card serves at the same time as a<br>
card module.<br>
The advantage which is provided by this aspect is particularly that using such a<br>
multifunction card it is possible to combine<br>
- the distribution of digital content over a mobile radio network,<br>
- the identification and authentication of the identity of the media<br>
consumer,<br>
the billing for the consumption of digital content, possibly with the<br>
interaction of a billing server which can be accessed via the mobile radio<br>
network, and<br>
- the payment of consumed and billed digital content, in particular with<br>
the interaction of the telecommunications service provider,<br>
in a single application device ("appliance") in a way which is transparent to the<br>
consumer.<br>
Even if the present invention does not preclude the distribution of digital<br>
content by means of the sale and marketing of physical data carriers, a virtual<br>
transmission is nevertheless more important in terms of minimizing the costs of<br>
business transactions. A suitable digital wide area network (WAN) is necessary<br>
for this. Mobile radio devices constitute, by definition, a means of accessing a<br>
digital wide area network in the form of a digital mobile radio network.<br>
Even if the virtual distribution of digital content by means of wire-bound wide<br>
area networks is also completely possible within the framework of the present<br>
invention, such wirefree transmission, for example by means of a mobile radio<br>
network, appears particularly advantageous as in this case the consumer can<br>
carry out his consumption transactions without being tied to a network infra-<br>
structure which is linebound and therefore not available everywhere.<br>
The identity or at least pseudonym of a consumer is known to the telecommu-<br>
nications service provider who issues the SIM card. In the case of SIM cards<br>
which are used on a credit basis without the need for stored value, the<br>
telecommunications service provider must already know at least the name and<br>
a billing address of his customer for billing purposes. In the case of SIM cards<br>
which allow credit, the telecommunications service provider frequently has<br>
information on a specific payment path, for example in the form of a standing<br>
order allowing said provider to deduct amounts due from a specific account.<br>
In the case of SIM cards which are issued by the telecommunications service<br>
provider as prepaid stored value cards, the charges for the use of digital<br>
content can be deducted from the amount of stored value managed by the<br>
telecommunications service provider. In theory, pseudonymous or even<br>
anonymous services are technically possible in this context. As far as the<br>
territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is concerned, pseudonymous or<br>
even anonymous issuing of SIM cards for GSM networks is not possible<br>
according to the relevant regulations of the telecommunications law which are<br>
intended to permit the authorized authorities to monitor the telecommunica-<br>
tions traffic without difficulty. However, in other countries this may be different<br>
in certain cases.<br>
An eleventh aspect of the solution according to the invention is the approach in<br>
which a specific appliance is provided for distributing, billing and paying for<br>
digital content as video on demand. This may, for example, take the form of<br>
what is referred to as a "set top box", i.e. a converter device between a cable<br>
television network and a television set. This set top box can also be provided<br>
with a digitization device for adapting analog television channels, which device<br>
detects, samples and digitizes the analog signal representing a television frame,<br>
for example by what is referred to as a "frame grabber" device.<br>
Play and Order<br>
A twelfth aspect relates to a particularly suitable solution for ordering and<br>
playing items and can be implemented with an independent inventive idea.<br>
Conventionally, virtual items and the like have to be selected and downloaded,<br>
or streamed, via the internet. By means of broadcasting it is possible to<br>
broadcast specific items in real time in an encrypted or nonencrypted form at<br>
predetermined times and to make them available to the consumer when<br>
specific conditions are fulfilled. However, this entails considerable costs for the<br>
content provider if films are to be supplied, for example, on demand. As in this<br>
case one and the same film has to be transmitted at different times over a<br>
plurality of channels in order to be able to implement as it were the "on<br>
demand" effect for the consumer, not only is the air interface overstretched but<br>
also the transmission is still ineffective. The invention is based on the object of<br>
only broadcasting video material in the form of trailers or in abbreviated form<br>
with an advert over such channels in order to make the consumers familiar with<br>
as many items as possible in one time period. This is in any case already done<br>
in the case of radio transmission as the broadcaster has to earn its money by<br>
means of advertising revenues. By means of a suitable technical device at the<br>
consumer end it is possible to mark such items by making inputs on the device<br>
if there is a corresponding uniquely defined identifying facility, for example by<br>
means of verbal or written information from a presenter, or technically by<br>
adding an item identifier in the transmitted item (analogous to the DaB in car<br>
radios). By marking specific items, for example corresponding filters are set up<br>
on the reception part of the device. It is possible to broadcast the trailers over<br>
days at several intervals. These may be pieces of music (radio), games<br>
(gameshow), films (video trailers) etc.<br>
At a later time or on another channel it is possible, depending on the items, to<br>
transmit them simultaneously by broadcasting to a large number of consumers,<br>
if appropriate in the same sequence of presentation, but this time compressed<br>
and encrypted over their entire length. The preset device at the consumer<br>
selects, by means of the filters, the desired items by filtering out the undesired<br>
items and stores them on a suitable storage medium which is provided for this<br>
purpose. If the user is legitimized by corresponding rights, for example by<br>
means of a rights card (smartcard), he is able to consume stored items. Charges<br>
are preferably incurred only when the items are actually used. The items can<br>
also be ordered over the Internet or offline, the items being delivered in this<br>
case in an addressed fashion.<br>
Charge-incurring transmission of data on the part of the consumer<br>
A thirteenth aspect of the solution according to the invention is the approach in<br>
which technical facilities are provided which are suitable and intended for<br>
transmitting person-specific data from the field of the consumer, for example<br>
relating to his consumption habits, to the operator of the portal data processing<br>
system or to individual content providers, the consumer being granted status<br>
rights in return for this transmission of data.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a networked data processing device<br>
according to the invention with a server part 110 and a client part 120. The<br>
server part 110 and the client part 120 are connected to one another via a<br>
telecommunications network 130 which is designated as a WAN (Wide Area<br>
Network), for example via the analog telephone network, via the ISDN network,<br>
via the Internet or via a satellite link for exchanging data. The server part 110<br>
and the client part 120 are typically each assigned a unique address or identifier<br>
112, 122, for example a telephone number, an Internet address or the like, for<br>
the purpose of exchanging data via the WAN 130. If the client part 120 wishes<br>
to set up a link to the server part 110 via the WAN 130, it requires information<br>
about its address 112. Conversely, the server part 110 requires information<br>
about the address 122 of the client part 120.<br>
The client part 120 is designed to hold a mobile card module 140. The card<br>
module 140 comprises at least one storage device for the nonvolatile storage of<br>
data {not illustrated) and can exchange data with the client part 120 via a data<br>
communications device (not illustrated). The card module 140 may be<br>
configured in particular as a chipcard; however, other easily transportable<br>
designs are also possible. Basic properties of chipcards are disclosed, inter alia,<br>
in Wolfgang Rankl and Wolfgang Effing: "Handbuch der Chipkarten [Chipcard<br>
manual]", Munich: Carl Hanser Verlag, 2nd edition 1996. The disclosures of this<br>
publication are included by reference in the present description. A card module<br>
140 which can be used as a chipcard which is printed on both sides is particu-<br>
larly preferred. Here, for example one side of the chipcard may be formed by a<br>
media content provider who issues this card to his customers. When the card is<br>
inserted with this side facing upward into a terminal, a preferred connection to a<br>
selection page of this provider is set up. The other side is formed, for example,<br>
by the operator of the portal data processing device. When this side of the card<br>
is inserted facing upward, a connection to a register and/or a search engine of<br>
this operator of the portal data processing device is preferably made available,<br>
said connection permitting items to be selected independently of a media<br>
content provider. However, on the specific side of the media content provider<br>
who takes up one side of the card there is preferably at least a link to the side of<br>
the operator of the portal data processing device so that the user does not have<br>
to remove the card and turn it around but rather can also change over to other<br>
providers and the media content which they provide by clicking on a link<br>
button.<br>
The server part 110 is a computer which is typically assigned to a commercial<br>
provider of goods and/or services. The server part 110 may be, for example, a<br>
computer which is connected to the telephone network via a modem or ISDN<br>
and which can be dialed up for data communication via a dialed line connection<br>
from the client part 120. In another embodiment, the server part 110 is a "World<br>
Wide Web" server ("WWW server") which is connected to the Internet and which<br>
can communicate with the client part 120 via the hypertext transport protocol<br>
(HTTP protocol). In a further embodiment, the server part is embodied, for<br>
example, as a computer which is connected to the Internet and which can<br>
exchange electronic mail (e-mail) with the client part 120 via the simple mail<br>
transport protocol (SMTP) and via the Post Office Protocol (POP). The invention<br>
is not restricted to certain types of telecommunications networks or to specific<br>
protocols; to this extent, the information given above is exclusively for the<br>
purpose of illustration.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic view of various aspects of the commercial use of a<br>
data processing device according to the invention. The inventive interaction<br>
between the card module 140 and the client part 120 permits the end user (not<br>
illustrated) who is accessing the server part 110 via the client part 120 to carry<br>
out advantageous processing of transactions.<br>
- Aspect (1): On the one hand, the card module 140 permits, by inter-<br>
acting with the client part 120, a system-independent setup of the<br>
communication relationship to the server part 110, for example by<br>
means of a system-independent dialing-in process. For this purpose,<br>
access data, access configurations or access procedures are stored in<br>
the memory of the card module 140. This avoids the need for the end<br>
user to carry out complex configuration of the access data, for example<br>
with an Internet access provider, with a server for electronic mail or with<br>
a server for processing electronic subscriptions. In one preferred variant,<br>
the client part 120 may be configured with the card module 140 in such<br>
a way that the end user merely has to plug the card module 140 into the<br>
client part 120 in order to initiate the setup of a telecommunications link<br>
to a server part 110. Where it is displayed, the initiation of the setup of a<br>
telecommunications link to the server part 110 can additionally be made<br>
dependent on the activation of an operator control element, in particular<br>
on the client part 120, and/or on the inputting of an item of security<br>
information, for example a PIN.<br>
Aspect (2): The card module 140 permits, by interacting with the client<br>
part 120, the end user to be differentiated and/or identified with respect<br>
to the server part 110. Three cases are to be distinguished here: on the<br>
one hand there may be cases in which it is not necessary or not<br>
desirable or legally unacceptable to identify the end user by name,<br>
address etc., but nevertheless various end users who each have<br>
separate card modules 140 are to be capable of being distinguished<br>
from one another in said cases. This may take place, on the one hand,<br>
by means of pure serialization of the card module 140, for example by<br>
means of a uniquely defined serial number which is written into a<br>
memory area, which cannot be overwritten, of the card module 140 and<br>
which does not repeat; if the end user successively uses various card<br>
modules 140 with different serial numbers, it is not possible to infer the<br>
identity of the end user without additional logic linking information. A<br>
third variant includes a pseudonym identification of the end user over a<br>
plurality of card modules 140 which, however, does not permit the<br>
identity of the end user to be inferred without additional information. In<br>
the case of prepaid card modules 140, it will frequently be possible to<br>
dispense with identification of the end user. If payment processing by<br>
the submission of an invoice, credit card, direct debit etc. is provided,<br>
data for completely identifying the end user will generally be necessary.<br>
A pseudonym is always appropriate if the intended exchange of<br>
performance is to be carried out even without knowledge of the identity<br>
of the end user but taking into account the knowledge of which different<br>
card modules 140 are to be assigned to the same end user (see also in<br>
particular aspect 7).<br>
Aspect (3): The card module 140 also permits, by interacting with the<br>
client part 120, authentication with respect to the server part 110, i.e.<br>
specific authenticity properties of a card module 140 can be checked<br>
from the server part. Preferably known cryptographic methods can be<br>
used for this purpose. It is possible, for example, to store in a nonvolatile<br>
area of the memory (not illustrated) of the card module 140 -said area<br>
being tamper-proof - a secret cryptographic key which is assigned to a<br>
specific end user. However, the cryptographic key does not need to be<br>
assigned to an end user in all cases; it is also possible to use these<br>
technologies to distinguish card modules 140 which have been legiti-<br>
mately placed in circulation by an authorized manufacturer from card<br>
modules which have been simulated by unauthorized third parties.<br>
Aspect (4): In addition, the card module 140 permits, by interacting with<br>
the client part 120, chronologically recurring transactions with the server<br>
part 110, in particular subscriptions for specific services, to be<br>
controlled.<br>
Aspect (5): Furthermore, the card module 140 permits, by interacting<br>
with the client part 120, card-moduleâ€”specific decryption of files which<br>
are supplied by the server part 110 and which can represent, for<br>
example, software, text and/or multimedia items. This provides an<br>
effective technical protection of copyrights.<br>
Aspect (6): The card module 140 also permits, by interacting with the<br>
client part 120, files which are supplied by the server part 110, and which<br>
may represent, for example, multimedia items, to be used in a way<br>
which is metered in a timed fashion. As a result, a technical infra-<br>
structure for the useâ€”timeâ€”dependent calculation of copyrights can be<br>
implemented (see also in particular Aspect 7).<br>
Aspect (7): The card module 140 also permits, by interacting with the<br>
client part 120, payment transactions with the server part 110 to be<br>
processed, for example by transmitting credit card numbers or digital<br>
cash. Various alternatives are to be distinguished here: on the one hand,<br>
a card module 140 which is placed in circulation may incorporate a<br>
specific amount of prepaid credit which is represented by means of a<br>
corresponding, predetermined data element which is stored in the<br>
memory (not illustrated) of the card module. On the other hand, the<br>
payment may be made in a person-specific fashion by the submission<br>
of an invoice, a credit card or a direct debit, the necessary details<br>
relating to the identity and the payment transaction data (account<br>
number, credit card number, billing address etc.) being stored in the<br>
memory (not illustrated) of the card module 140. In both cases it is<br>
advantageous to protect the authenticity of the card module 140 and the<br>
data elements stored in its memory by means of a digital signature<br>
which is generated by the legitimate issuing office. Irrespective of the<br>
above distinction between prepaid credit and ongoing billing, there is an<br>
alternative between the acquisition of files according to the principle of<br>
purchasing, i.e. after a purchase price is paid once there is a chrono-<br>
logically unlimited possibility of use, and billing according to intensity of<br>
use, preferably measured with respect to the use time or the volume of<br>
actually used data from a file. Finally, there is a further independent<br>
alternative between card modules 140 which, even at the time at which<br>
they are placed in circulation, have already been provided with all the<br>
necessary billing-related data elements and card modules 140 in which<br>
the billing-related data elements are not transmitted from the server<br>
part 110 to the memory (not illustrated) of the card module 140 until said<br>
card modules 140 have been issued to the end user. The eight individual<br>
cases which originate from the combination of these three alternatives<br>
each condition a particular technical embodiment of the card module<br>
and its interaction within the scope of the solution according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Aspect (8): If the card module 140 is equipped with sufficient storage<br>
capacity, for example in the form of what is referred to as a flash<br>
memory, files which represent, for example, programs for data<br>
processing systems, texts or multimedia items can be stored temporarily<br>
or permanently in the card module. As a result, in particular the technical<br>
implementation of systems which have already been referred to in<br>
Aspect (4) for the automated periodic acquisition of software, text and/or<br>
files which represent multimedia items and are distributed by the server<br>
part 110 is improved.<br>
- Aspect (9): Finally, the card module 140 can be used, by interacting with<br>
the client part 120, to enable or disable specific functionalities by the<br>
server part 110 in a telematic fashion.<br>
In a data processing device according to the invention, it is not necessary to<br>
implement all the aspects simultaneously.<br>
The exemplary embodiments and their variants which are described below<br>
make use, to a certain extent, of specific cryptographic techniques such as, for<br>
example, asymmetrical cryptography and digital signatures. An introduction to<br>
applied cryptography can be found, for example, in: Bruce Schneier: "Applied<br>
Cryptography", New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994. The disclosures of this<br>
document are incorporated by reference in the present description.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a first application of the invention by means of a schematic view of<br>
a data processing device according to the invention. As already illustrated in<br>
fig. 1, a client part 120 is connected via a WAN 130 to a server part 110. The<br>
client part 120 is provided with a display device 125 which is illustrated only<br>
schematically. The card module 140 which is held by the client part identifies a<br>
specific end user (not illustrated) to whom the card module 140 is assigned<br>
personally or by means of a pseudonym. In particular, an item of identity infor-<br>
mation 141, which can be transmitted to the server part 110 via the WAN 130, is<br>
stored in the card module 140. The identity information 141 may be additionally<br>
secured in a customary fashion on pages of the client part 120, for example by<br>
means of a PIN or by means of biometric identity detection devices (not illus-<br>
trated). In addition to the card module 140, there may be other card modules<br>
140a, 140b, 140c which are each assigned to the identities SN1, SN2 and SN3. If<br>
the card module 140 which is associated with the identity SN4 141 is replaced<br>
with one of the other card modules 140a, 140b, 140c, the respective assigned<br>
identity information SN1, SN2 and SN3 can be transmitted to the server part<br>
110. The first application of the invention which is illustrated in fig. 3 is<br>
significant particularly if an acting subject is to be capable at least of being<br>
distinguished for example in its property as a contractual partner with respect<br>
to the server part 110, or else is to be capable of being identified directly or by<br>
means of a pseudonym.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a second application of the invention by means of a schematic<br>
view of a data processing device according to the invention. As already illus-<br>
trated in fig. 1, a client part 120 is connected to a server part 110 via a<br>
WAN 130. The client part 120 is provided with a display device 125 which is<br>
illustrated only schematically. The card module 140 which is held by the client<br>
part can identify a specific contractual relationship AbD 141, in particular by<br>
means of a predetermined data element, said relationship including in the<br>
present example the regular supply (subscription) of a digital multimedia<br>
product. In addition to the card module 140, other card modules 140a, 140b,<br>
140c which are each assigned to the contractual relationships AbA, AbB and<br>
AbC (141a, 141b, 141c) may also exist. If the card module 140 which is<br>
associated with the contractual relationship 141 is replaced with one of the<br>
other card modules 140a, 140b, 140c, the respective assigned contractual<br>
relationship information 141a, 141b and 141c can be transmitted to the server<br>
part 110. The respective contractual relationship information 141, 141a, 141b,<br>
141c is a characteristic variable which controls an automated selection process<br>
with respect to the file (not illustrated) which is to be transmitted from the<br>
server part 110 to the client part 120 and represents a multimedia represen-<br>
tation, as well as with respect to the transmission time.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a fourth application of the invention by means of a schematic view<br>
of a data processing device according to the invention. As already illustrated in<br>
fig. 1, a client part 120 is connected to a server part 110 via a WAN 130. The<br>
client part 120 is provided with a display device 125 which is illustrated only<br>
schematically. The card module 140 which is held by the client part identifies, in<br>
particular, a specific server part 110 which may be assigned, for example, to an<br>
associated specific service provider SPr4. In addition to the card module 140,<br>
there may be other card modules 140a, 140b, 140c which are each assigned to<br>
the service providers SPr1, SPr2 and SPr3 (141a, 141b, 141c). If the card<br>
module 140 which is associated with the service provider 141 is replaced with<br>
one of the other card modules 140a, 140b, 140c, the respective assigned<br>
service provider information 141a, 141b and 141c can be transmitted to the<br>
server part 110. The respective service provider information 141, 141a, 141b,<br>
141c is a characteristic variable which brings about in particular an automatic<br>
selection process with respect to the data transmission parameters from the<br>
client part 120 so that automatic initiation of a data exchange between the client<br>
part 120 and server part 110 is made possible.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a first variant of an embodiment of the solution according to the<br>
invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in fig. 1, a client part<br>
120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 is connected to a server part<br>
110 via a WAN 130. The client part 120 is provided with a display device 125<br>
which is illustrated only schematically. Fig. 6 thus shows a solution in which the<br>
client part 120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 and the display<br>
device 125 form a piece of equipment which is essentially embodied mechani-<br>
cally in one piece.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a second variant of an embodiment of the solution according to<br>
the invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in fig. 1, a client<br>
part 120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 is provided. The client<br>
part 120 is connected via a data communications device 123 to a display device<br>
125 which is illustrated only schematically and which is connected to a server<br>
part 110 via a WAN 130. Fig. 7 thus shows a solution in which the client part 120<br>
which is designed to hold a card module 140, on the one hand, and the display<br>
device 125 which is connected to the WAN 130, on the other, each independ-<br>
ently form a piece of equipment which is essentially embodied in one piece in<br>
mechanical terms, the exchange of data between the client part 120 and the<br>
display part 125 being carried out by means of the data communications device<br>
123. Wirefree and wirebound devices and methods, in particular by means of a<br>
data transmission cable (not illustrated), by radio (not illustrated) or by infrared,<br>
for example IrDA (not illustrated), are possible as technical implementations of<br>
the data communications device.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a third variant of an embodiment of the solution according to the<br>
invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in fig. 1, a client part<br>
120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 and which is connected to a<br>
server part 110 via a WAN 130 is provided. The client part 120 is connected via<br>
a data communications device 123 to a display device 125 which is illustrated<br>
only schematically. Fig. 8 thus shows a solution in which the client part 120<br>
which is designed to hold a card module 140 and is connected to the WAN 130,<br>
on the one hand, and the display device 125, on the other, each form in<br>
themselves a device which is essentially embodied in one piece in mechanical<br>
terms, the exchange of data between the client part 120 and the display part<br>
125 being carried out by means of the data communications device 123.<br>
Wirefree and wirebound devices and methods, in particular by means of a data<br>
transmission cable (not illustrated), by radio (not illustrated) or by infrared, for<br>
example IrDA (not illustrated), are possible as technical implementations of the<br>
data communications device.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a fourth variant of an embodiment of the solution according to the<br>
invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in fig. 1, a client part<br>
120 which is designed to hold at least one card module 140 and which is<br>
connected to a server part 110 via a WAN 130 is provided. In addition to the<br>
client part 120 there is a display device 125 which is illustrated only schemati-<br>
cally and which is also designed to hold at least one card module 140. Fig. 9<br>
thus shows a solution in which the client part 120 which is designed to hold a<br>
card module 140 and is connected to the WAN 130, on the one hand, and the<br>
display device 125, on the other, each form in themselves a piece of equipment<br>
which can be embodied essentially in one piece in mechanical terms, the<br>
exchange of data between the client part 120 and the display part 125 being<br>
carried out by reinserting the card module 140. For example, the card module<br>
140 can be held in the client part 140 in order to store data which is supplied by<br>
the server part 110. After the respective data has been stored in the card<br>
module 140, this data can be presented in a sensorially perceptible form by<br>
reinserting the card module into the display device. Conversely it is also<br>
possible to store, for example, data relating to ordering processes in the card<br>
module 140 if it has been held by the display device 125. After the card module<br>
140 has been reinserted into the client part 140, this ordering data can be fed to<br>
the server part 110 via the WAN 130.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a fifth variant of an embodiment of the solution according to the<br>
invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in fig. 1, a client part<br>
120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 is provided. The client part<br>
120 is connected via a data communications device 123 to a display device 125<br>
which is illustrated only schematically and is connected to a server part 110 via<br>
a WAN 130. Fig. 10 thus shows a solution in which the client part 120 which is<br>
designed to hold a card module 140, on the one hand, and the display device<br>
125 which is connected to the WAN 130, on the other, each form in themselves<br>
a piece of equipment which is essentially embodied in one piece in mechanical<br>
terms, the exchange of data between the client part 120 and the display part<br>
125 being carried out by means of the data communications device 123.<br>
Wirefree and wirebound devices and methods, in particular by means of a data<br>
transmission cable (not illustrated), by radio (not illustrated) or by infrared, for<br>
example IrDA (not illustrated), are possible as technical implementations of the<br>
data communications device.<br>
The client part 120 which is illustrated in fig. 10 is designed to hold a multiplicity<br>
of card modules 140a-140e which can respectively initiate and control<br>
independently of one another communications processes with the server part<br>
110 by means of the card module data (not illustrated) which is stored on said<br>
card modules 140aâ€”140e, and which can be addressed independently of one<br>
another, from the point of view of the server part 110, during communications<br>
transactions which are initiated by the server part 110. For example, at least one<br>
of the card modules 140a-140e may act as a component of a system which is<br>
illustrated in fig. 4, i.e. a card module or several card modules serve as a<br>
memory for digital multimedia products which are supplied in digital form by<br>
the server part 110 via the WAN 130, regularly but asynchronously with respect<br>
to operator control actions of the user.<br>
The particular feature of the arrangement illustrated in fig. 10 in comparison<br>
with the arrangement illustrated in fig. 7 is in particular the fact that a master<br>
card module 140 is provided with which the display device 125 can identify and<br>
authenticate itself in a particular way with respect to the client part 120 and the<br>
other card modules 140a-140e inserted in it. For example, the master card<br>
module 140 can be inserted into a digital book which is used as a display device<br>
125. The digital book is then configured by the master card module 140 in such<br>
a way that, with respect to the client part and the further card modules 140a-<br>
140e inserted in it, specific privileged operator control transactions, for example<br>
the enabling or disabling of the client part 120 for supplies by the server part<br>
110 or the performance of ordering transactions with respect to the server part<br>
110, can be carried out by the user using the data communications device 123.<br>
For this purpose, the data communication via the data communications device<br>
123 is preferably protected against tapping and manipulation by means of<br>
suitable technologies, in particular cryptographic technologies.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a sixth variant of an embodiment of the solution according to the<br>
invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in fig. 1, a client part<br>
120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 and which is connected to a<br>
server part 110 via a WAN 130 is provided. The client part 120 is connected via<br>
a data communications device 123 to a display device 125 which is illustrated<br>
only schematically. Fig. 10 also thus shows a solution in which the client part<br>
120 which is designed to hold at least one card module 140, on the one hand,<br>
and the display device 125 which is connected to the WAN 130, on the other,<br>
each form in themselves a piece of equipment which is essentially embodied in<br>
one piece in mechanical terms, the exchange of data between the client part<br>
120 and the display part 125 being carried out by means of the data communi-<br>
cations device 123. The particular feature of the arrangement illustrated in<br>
fig. 11 with respect to the arrangement illustrated in fig. 7 is in particular the fact<br>
that the client part 120 is designed, as also in the case illustrated in fig. 10, to<br>
hold a plurality of card modules 140a-140e which, by means of the card<br>
module data (not illustrated) which is stored on them, can each respectively<br>
initiate and control communications transactions with the server part 110<br>
independently of one another and which can be addressed independently of<br>
one another, from the point of view of the server part 110, during communica-<br>
tions transactions which are initiated by the server part 110. For example, at<br>
least one of the card modules 140a-140e may act as a component of a system<br>
(illustrated in fig. 4), i.e. a card module or a plurality of card modules serve as a<br>
memory for digital multimedia products which are supplied in digital form by<br>
the server part 110 via the WAN 130, regularly but asynchronously with respect<br>
to operator control transactions of the user.<br>
In the variant illustrated in fig. 11, it proves particularly advantageous to<br>
implement the client part 120 as a fixed card module station which is connected<br>
essentially continuously to the WAN 130 and can thus always initiate data<br>
communication transactions with respect to the server part 110, and<br>
furthermore can receive data communication transactions initiated by the<br>
server part 110, asynchronously with respect to use transactions of the user,<br>
even if the display device 125 is embodied as a mobile device which the user<br>
carries on his person even when he is not present at the location.<br>
Both with respect to the variant illustrated in fig. 10 and with respect to the<br>
variant illustrated in fig. 11, it may prove to be advantageous to embody the<br>
display device 125 to hold at least one card module 140 so that the mode of use<br>
illustrated in fig. 9 can be used by reinserting a card module.<br>
While the client part 120 is designed to hold at least one card module 140 in the<br>
variants illustrated in figs 6 to 11, figures 12 and 13 each show a variant in<br>
which a client part 120 is used without a separate card module. Fig. 13 shows a<br>
client part 120 which is designed to hold a complete display device 125, the<br>
display device 125 being in turn designed to hold at least one card module 140.<br>
Data communication takes place between the server part 110 and card module<br>
140 in a method in which the exchanged data is passed through the display<br>
device 125 by means of suitable electronic measures. Admittedly, it is not<br>
absolutely necessary for the client part 120 to be designed to hold a complete<br>
display device 125. The exchange of data between the client part 120, on the<br>
one hand, and the display device 125 which is prepared so as to hold at least<br>
one card module 140, on the other, may, for example, also be implemented, as<br>
illustrated in fig. 13, by means of a data communications device 123. Wirefree<br>
and wirebound devices methods, in particular by means of data transmission<br>
cables (not illustrated), by radio (not illustrated) or by infrared, for example IrDA<br>
(not illustrated), are possible as technical implementations for the data<br>
communications device.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 show further variants of an embodiment of the solution<br>
according to the invention which is illustrated in fig. 1. As already illustrated in<br>
fig. 1, a client part 120 which is designed to hold a card module 140 and which<br>
is connected to a server part 110 via a WAN 130 is also provided in fig. 14. A<br>
display device 125 is also connected to the WAN 130a. The WAN 130 can be<br>
identical to the WAN 130a. An interaction - triggered by means of the display<br>
device 125 and transmitted via the WAN 130a - with the server part 110 causes<br>
multimedia data to be transmitted from server 110 to the client part 120 via the<br>
WAN 130. As a result, the user (not illustrated) may call, for example when on<br>
route, data from the server part 110 which is transmitted via the WAN 130 to<br>
the client part 120 which is, for example, installed at home.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a variant in which the client part 120 is provided with a display<br>
device 125. The data (not illustrated) which is called at the server part 110 is<br>
transmitted to a secondary client part 120a via the WAN 130.<br>
Figure 16 shows a schematic blockâ€”diagramâ€”like view of a device 100<br>
according to the invention for distributing, billing and paying for digital media<br>
content.<br>
Files 104, 106, 108 which are made available by content providers 102 are held<br>
ready for distribution on a server 110. The distribution of the files to individual<br>
client computers is preferably carried out in encrypted form by downloading via<br>
the Internet or by the sales and marketing of physical data carriers such as CDs,<br>
DVDs, flash memories etc. (not illustrated). Here, when dialing in to a service<br>
provider, specific item formats can be selected using means in the client<br>
computer or in the playback device so that, for example, an MP3 player is<br>
provided only with MP3â€”compatible items for downloading. By means of a<br>
personal computer or notebook or television with an Internet connection it<br>
would be possible to view all the formats of distributable items using specific<br>
rubrics for selecting and ordering (download, upload, streaming or broadcast).<br>
The digital content which is made available to the client computer is repre-<br>
sented symbolically and marked with the reference symbol 112. The billing and<br>
payment of the charges for these digital content 112 are carried out by an<br>
exemplary function block 120.<br>
The function block 120 has a decoder 122 which firstly decrypts (reference<br>
symbol 124) the digital content cryptographically and then makes them acces-<br>
sible in some suitable technical fashion to sensory perception by the consumer<br>
128. In the case of MP3 audio files, this may be done, for example, by gener-<br>
ating an analog audio signal which can be reproduced with a loudspeaker 126<br>
or headset (not illustrated). In the case of other content (for example texts,<br>
images, videos; not illustrated), there may also be, for example, a visual display<br>
on a display device (not illustrated).<br>
An evaluation device 130 is connected to the decoder 120 in order to generate<br>
data continuously for a consumption history 132 while the media is being used<br>
by the consumer 128, said data describing the respective use process with<br>
sufficient precision to allow billing to be carried out later. The consumption<br>
history contains, for example, data on the duration of use of an audio title or, in<br>
the case of other formats of items (for example text; not illustrated), also<br>
contains data on used pages of text and the individual use times with respect to<br>
individual pages of text. Other possibilities for registering or metering use are<br>
also possible.<br>
A limiter 134 is provided in order to supply a calculation of the charge total<br>
which is accumulated according to the data in the consumption history 132,<br>
continuously or at specific time intervals as a function in the consumption<br>
history, and to transmit a disable signal 136 to the decoder 122 when predeter-<br>
mined charge totals are exceeded. As soon as the decoder 122 receives the<br>
disable signal 136 from the limiter 134, the use of the encrypted content 112 is<br>
interrupted until the limiter 134 cancels the disable signal 136. Instead of a<br>
charge total, time credits or credits in terms of volume of use are possible. A<br>
hybrid variant of the possibilities described above is also possible.<br>
A stored-value memory 140 stores a data value which represents a sum of<br>
money, an available use time or an available use volume which the consumer<br>
128 has stored in order to cover future billing totals, for example through<br>
payment in advance in the form of a security. The stored-vaiue memory 140<br>
can be topped up by means of all customary micropayment systems. These<br>
include, for example, click and buy, paysafe (prepaid) or loading on by means<br>
of a service number such as, for example, a 0190 number. When the stored<br>
value is loaded on by means of a 0190 number, it is possible, for example, to<br>
load specific amounts of stored value by means of different telephone numbers<br>
which may be configured as end numbers for a master number, and for these<br>
amounts to be billed by the telecommunications companies. Loading up a<br>
storedâ€”value memory, in particular for offline use of digital items, programs or<br>
the like, by means of a service number is an independent inventive idea for<br>
which protection is independently claimed. In particular, loading up a stored-<br>
vaiue memory in a connectable payment module, for example a smartcard, by<br>
means of a service number is advantageously possible. This stored value can in<br>
turn be stored value in terms of money, a time credit or a volume-related<br>
credit. Items-specific rights of use and/or privileges can also be set up by<br>
means of a service number.<br>
The limiter 134 preferably fulfills its functionality by interacting with the storedâ€”<br>
value memory 140, i.e. as long as a stored value is present, the decoder 122 is<br>
not blocked.<br>
The function block 120 contains critical data and functionalities which have to<br>
be protected against any unauthorized manipulation from the outside, in<br>
particular by the consumer. The decryption key 123 by means of which the<br>
decoder 122 cryptographically decrypts the data 112 representing the digital<br>
content, and thus makes it available to further processing, is particularly<br>
sensitive. The amount of stored value (not illustrated) stored in the storedâ€”<br>
value memory 140 is also highly sensitive. The consumption measuring means<br>
130 and the limiter 134 are critical functionalities because the aimed-at billing<br>
of charges can be sabotaged by manipulating these devices.<br>
It is therefore advantageous to set up the function block 120 as a particularly<br>
protected (tamper-proof) assembly. In the simplest case, the individual<br>
elements of this assembly 120 can be embedded, for example, in a sealing<br>
compound, for example artificial resin. In further developed solutions it is<br>
possible to provide sensors (not illustrated) which are suitable for detecting<br>
unacceptable mechanical and/or electrical manipulations. The output signal of<br>
these sensors can then be used to delete instantaneously critical data such as,<br>
for example, cryptographic keys 123 or amounts of stored value in the stored-<br>
value memory 140. The stored-value memory 140 and/or limiter 134 compo-<br>
nents which, in the exemplary embodiment shown according to figure 16, are<br>
combined in one functional block 120 can also be contained in a separate<br>
module or separate modules which can be connected to the function module<br>
120.<br>
All the components which are combined in the function module 120 can be<br>
implemented either as separate hardware components or as individual software<br>
modules or else completely as a software solution, for example in the form of<br>
plug-ins for a browser.<br>
The consumption history 132 also represents an aggregation of sensitive data<br>
which has to be protected against manipulation. To do this, the memory (not<br>
illustrated) for storing the consumption history 132 can also be included in the<br>
protected function block 120 (not illustrated). Another possibility is to protect<br>
the data values of the consumption history 132 against unauthorized changes<br>
by one or more digital signatures. To do this, a digital signature generating and<br>
testing component (not illustrated) which is advantageously included in the<br>
protected critical function block 120 is then provided.<br>
When the binding billing and payment is carried out, the data content of the<br>
consumption history is preferably transmitted in a suitable way over a data<br>
network link, protected cryptographically against unauthorized monitoring and<br>
data manipulation, to a billing server 145. The billing server calculates, by<br>
reference to the data of the consumption history, the charge which is to be paid<br>
by the consumer and deducts the corresponding amount, for example by<br>
means of a debit transaction from a (dummy) account 150 which is assigned to<br>
the consumer. The consumer can then carry out a payment transaction in a<br>
conventional way, for example by means of a money transfer or by means of a<br>
credit card clearing house. The account 150 is not obligatory; if such payment<br>
systems are to be used which do not require a (dummy) account 150, such as<br>
anonymous digital cash, it is possible to dispense with the account 150.<br>
After payment has been made, or, given appropriate creditworthiness of the<br>
consumer, also after billing by the billing server 145 has taken place, the<br>
amount of stored value which is stored in the stored-value memory 140 can be<br>
increased by a specific amount of stored value by transmitting a stored-value<br>
message 155, protected cryptographically against manipulations, from the<br>
billing server 145 to the function unit 120 or to the stored-value memory 140.<br>
The stored-value memory 140 is particularly preferably accommodated on a<br>
smartcard in order to be able to use the stored amount of stored value<br>
independently of a system and in a mobile fashion, even on other pieces of<br>
equipment. The function module 120 contains in this case a smartcard reader<br>
(not shown). The component which contains the smartcard reader may be<br>
embodied, for example, as a PCMCIA card which has the functionalities of the<br>
function module 120.<br>
An alternative (not illustrated) to fig. 16 is for a module which can be coupled to<br>
a playback device to be preferably capable of being plugged in, for example<br>
PCMCIA, with an integrated memory in which, inter alia, what are referred to as<br>
players and/or playback licenses can be stored in such a way that when the<br>
module is connected to another playback device or computer the license with<br>
the corresponding playback rights or rights of use can be used and is not made<br>
unusable or invalid by using another playback device. Here, already existing<br>
license solutions of other providers can easily be modified and/or the module<br>
can be provided with means such that the system-independent use of the<br>
license or licenses of the player or players and/or of the items of the providers<br>
by means of the module is possible, but it is not possible to produce a copy of<br>
licenses, rights or amounts of stored value. In one further embodiment (not<br>
illustrated), means are used to embody a smartcard as a rights card in such a<br>
way that they make it possible, by interacting with a software license installed<br>
on a computer, to play back correspondingly provided multimedia data (items).<br>
Here, in particular information for identifying and/or checking the authorization<br>
to use the license, the player and/or specific items is made available by means<br>
of the smartcard. In one further development, a software license or a player can<br>
be modified in such a way that different users can use items or application<br>
programs etc., which are made available by means of a separate smartcard,<br>
without having to install a new license on the computer or playback device.<br>
Payment by means of a smartcard is possible, for example by means of units of<br>
money, setting off against a time credit and/or a credit in terms of usable data<br>
volume. It is likewise possible to embody the smartcard as a debit card and/or<br>
credit card.<br>
Fig. 17 shows a schematic block-diagram-like illustration of a detail of the<br>
device illustrated in fig. 16. The server 110 makes available digital content (not<br>
illustrated) and can be connected to the protected function block 120, for<br>
example, by means of a wide area data network (WAN) 210 via a modem 212.<br>
The function block 120 is connected in this case to a playback device and has a<br>
browser/player 1500 which can also be embodied as a plug-in for an existing<br>
browser and which is capable of also representing status information relating to<br>
consumed units, times or prices or remaining amounts of stored value, in<br>
addition to the decrypted data. Instead of a modem, another suitable network<br>
functionality device, for example for ISDN, GSM or UMTS, can also be used.<br>
Specific details from fig. 16, such as in particular the consumption measuring<br>
means 130, limiter 134 and stored-value memory 140, are not illustrated in<br>
fig. 17.<br>
In fig. 17, a card module 215 is provided which can optionally be used as a<br>
rights card and control card for controlling the decoder 122, which card is<br>
preferably embodied as a smartcard.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a schematic view of a first exemplary system architecture of a<br>
device according to the invention for distributing, billing and paying for digital<br>
media content.<br>
A use device for the use of digital content by the consumer is designated by the<br>
reference symbol 310. The use device 310 can be provided with a connection<br>
device for connecting a card module 315.<br>
A media server 320 keeps ready content files 330 which each contain digital<br>
content and charge scheme information. The media server 320 can be<br>
connected via a data network link 340, preferably via the Internet, to the use<br>
device 310, in particular for downloading content files 330.<br>
Individual providers of digital content may operate delivery servers 350A, 350B,<br>
350C which are each connected via a data network connection 352A, 352B,<br>
325C, for example via the Internet, to the media server 320.<br>
In the arrangement illustrated in fig. 18, it is the responsibility of the providers<br>
350A, 350B, 350C to keep available files 354A, 354B, 354C with digital content<br>
and charge scheme information 356A, 356B, 356C. If a specific digital content is<br>
requested by the consumer (not illustrated) by means of the use device 310, the<br>
content provider 350A, 350B, 350C of the corresponding content file 354A,<br>
354B, 354C assigns specific charge scheme information 356A, 356B, 356C and<br>
transmits the content files 354A, 354B, 354C to the media server 320 from<br>
where they can be transmitted to the use device 310 for use by the consumer.<br>
Fig. 19 shows a schematic view of a second exemplary system architecture of a<br>
device according to the invention for distributing, billing and paying for digital<br>
media content.<br>
In the variant of the arrangement from fig. 18 which is shown in fig. 19, prede-<br>
termined tariff categories 322A, 322B, 322C, 322D are set up on the media<br>
server 320, and the providers of content files 354A, 354B, 354C stipulate the<br>
valid charge scheme model for each of the content files by virtue of the fact that<br>
the data transmission 352A, 352B, 352C, 352D takes place in a file-specific<br>
fashion into an area 322A, 322B, 322C, 322D of the media server 320 which is<br>
categorized according to charge scheme categories.<br>
Fig. 20 shows a first diagram relating to the discussion of the dependence of the<br>
volume - received by the consumer - of pages of a page-oriented text<br>
document (not illustrated) on the vertical axis on the use time, used for this<br>
page, on the horizontal axis. Here, the scaling of the vertical axis is to be<br>
understood in such a way that a page of text which has been read a plurality of<br>
times also counts to the extent corresponding to this plurality of times. The<br>
number of pages of the text item assumed in the illustrated example is<br>
120 pages.<br>
Assuming a constant reading speed, for example the reading curve which is<br>
designated C, has a low degree of steepness and in which each of the 120<br>
pages of the item has been read once by the consumer after approximately<br>
15 hours of reading time is obtained for an exemplary, slow reader.<br>
Correspondingly, for example the reading curve which is designated by B and<br>
has a high degree of steepness and in which each of the 120 pages of the item<br>
has been read once by the consumer after approximately 4 hours of reading<br>
time is obtained for an exemplary, fast reader.<br>
Finally, for example the reading curve which is designated by A and has a low<br>
degree of steepness and in which each of the 120 pages of the item has been<br>
read once by the consumer after approximately 7.5 hours of reading time is<br>
obtained for an exemplary, average-speed reader.<br>
With respect to the reading curve A, the charge scheme is selected in such a<br>
way that the distance from the zero point to the point at which approximately<br>
240 pages have been read by the consumer after approximately 15 hours is<br>
assigned to a charge amount of DM6.00. Accordingly, to read the item once<br>
costs DM3.00 in approximately 7.5 hours. Fractions or multiples thereof are<br>
correspondingly billed proportionally.<br>
Fig. 21 shows a curve diagram relating to the discussion of the dependence<br>
between the intensity of use of an item and the assigned price. Whereas in the<br>
diagram illustrated in fig. 20 the charge increases proportionally to the number<br>
of pages read, alternative, nonlinear charge scheme curves are illustrated in<br>
fig. 21.<br>
In this respect, in the illustrated example "sensory items" such as texts of "high"<br>
literature are distinguished from "functional items".<br>
In the case of sensory items, it may be desirable, in view of marketing consid-<br>
erations, to charge for the use of digital content by means of a corresponding<br>
technical infrastructure in such a way that the first quantity components of the<br>
use of the item by the consumer are billed with a lower charge so that the<br>
consumer can orientate himself, without worry, in terms of high expected use<br>
charges, and he is motivated to continue with the consumption.<br>
Correspondingly, it may be desirable with functional items to adopt a charge<br>
scheme for the use of digital content by means of a corresponding technical<br>
infrastructure in such a way that the first quantity components of the use of the<br>
item are billed with a higher charge in comparison with the use of later parts of<br>
the item by the consumer since the information which is extracted from the<br>
item by the consumer at the beginning frequently represents, on a subjective<br>
level, the most important useful value for the consumer.<br>
Fig. 22 shows a first diagram relating to the discussion of the dependence of the<br>
volume - received by the consumer - of a page of a text document on the use<br>
time spent on using this page.<br>
The time which the consumer takes to read a single page of a text-orientated<br>
item is plotted on the horizontal axis. The percentage of the quantity of text<br>
already read by the consumer in respect of the overall quantity of text on the<br>
page is represented on the vertical axis.<br>
The reading curve plotted in the diagram shown takes into account a certain<br>
orientation time t1 of, for example, 15 seconds, i.e. for all the times in the time<br>
interval between 0 and 15 seconds it is assumed that the reader has not<br>
absorbed reading matter to any substantial degree. At a time t1 + t2 which is<br>
taken by way of example, in the example therefore after 2 minutes and<br>
53 seconds, the reader will be assumed to have read approximately 75% of the<br>
quantity of text on the page of text under consideration. After an overall time<br>
t1 + t2 4-13 of 3 minutes and 45 seconds, the page has been completely read.<br>
The invention makes possible, for example, in particular a charge scheme in<br>
which a page-oriented item of text is billed as a function of the volume, an<br>
individual page which is displayed on a display not being completely calculated<br>
immediately after it becomes visible. Instead, during the orientation time [0,t1],<br>
in terms of the charge scheme the page is considered not to be used and is not<br>
billed at all. The page is considered to have been used entirely by the consumer<br>
in terms of the charge scheme only after a predetermined time t1 + t2 + t3.<br>
Fig. 23 shows in a schematic and exemplary form time profiles for the use of a<br>
page of a page-orientated item of text by the consumer for a charge scheme<br>
methodology which is illustrated in fig. 22.<br>
The rectangles symbolize, by way of example, the same page of a page-<br>
orientated item of text; here a page with the page number 21. After the page<br>
has been displayed on a display device, the page is considered as not being<br>
used within the orientation time of, for example, 15 seconds (fig. 23A). After the<br>
orientation time has expired, the price for the use of the page of, for example,<br>
DM 0.025 is billed completely (fig. 23B) even if the user has received only a<br>
fraction of the text content of the page. The period of time during which this<br>
page is displayed on the display is registered continuously (fig. 23C). Assuming<br>
that the reader terminates the display of the respective page after 15 seconds<br>
starting from the beginning of the charge-incurring use of the page after the<br>
expiry of the orientation time, by moving on to another page (in the example to<br>
page 36), aborting the use of the respective item or even switching off the<br>
display device (fig. 23D), the use time which is stored for this page up until then<br>
is buffered. A free-ofâ€”charge orientation time of 15 seconds is allocated for<br>
the orientation on the new page 36. If the consumer then causes the same page<br>
21 to be displayed again at a later time (fig. 23E), firstly a new orientation time is<br>
allocated. After the expiry of the new orientation time (fig. 23F), the billing of<br>
time continues taking into account the time already cumulatively spent viewing<br>
this page by the consumer in the past. If the time which has been predeter-<br>
mined for a single use of the page has expired, the page is considered to have<br>
been completely read (fig. 23G). There is no further time-dependent billing as<br>
long as the page continues to be displayed without interruption on the display<br>
(fig. 23H). Instead of individual storage of times of use which have been started<br>
for specific pages, it is also easily possible to run a time credit account in which<br>
unused times of all the pages which are exited prematurely are cumulated and<br>
made available to the user in order to view the same page or other, completely<br>
new pages.<br>
Fig. 24 shows a second diagram relating to the discussion of the dependence of<br>
the volume â€” received by the consumer - of a page of a text document on the<br>
use time spent on using this page.<br>
Here, the reading curve illustrated in fig. 24 corresponds to the reading state of<br>
the page illustrated in fig. 23C.<br>
Fig. 25 shows a third diagram relating to the discussion of the dependence of<br>
the volume â€” received by the consumer - of a page of a text document on the<br>
use time spent on using this page.<br>
Here, the reading curve illustrated in fig. 25 corresponds to the reading state of<br>
the page illustrated in fig. 23H.<br>
Fig. 26 shows a schematic view of the reading process with the acquisition of<br>
status rights.<br>
The charge scheme options which are made possible by the invention include,<br>
in particular, charge scheme models in which, in the case of a page-orientated<br>
text item, status rights can be acquired and presented in a suitable way in terms<br>
of information technology at the level of an entire item and/or at the level of a<br>
page. For example, the complex volume/time billing mode which is illustrated<br>
in figs 20 to 25 makes it possible for the consumer to be credited with residual<br>
components of the reading time which is respectively page-related. This is<br>
indicated symbolically in fig. 26 by virtue of the fact that the consumed time<br>
components per page are respectively represented in hatched form, whereas<br>
the remaining residual time components are not hatched. In addition, at the<br>
provider end rules can be predefined which describe the transition from a<br>
volume-orientated billing system, a time-orientated billing system or complex<br>
volume/time billing system to a purchase-orientated billing system.<br>
For example, for a specific item (identified in fig. 26 by an item identification<br>
number 2349457) it is possible to predefine that after reading twice the reader<br>
acquires a chronologically unrestricted right of use without an obligation to pay<br>
a further charge.<br>
In fig. 26, further possible charge scheme rules are given purely symbolically,<br>
for example rules that a degressive charge scheme is applied, or that the<br>
content cannot be used further after having been read twice.<br>
Fig. 27 shows a schematic view of a device according to the invention with a<br>
card.<br>
A first device for using and billing for the use of digital content and a second<br>
device for using and billing for the use of said content are respectively desig-<br>
nated by the references 1202 and 1204. The distribution server 110 is<br>
connected via the data traffic network (WAN) 210 to the devices 1202 and 1204<br>
for downloading files which are kept available on the server and have digital<br>
content which are provided for use by the consumer (not illustrated). It goes<br>
without saying that these files can also be transferred to the consumer for use<br>
by the devices 1202 and 1204 by exchanging physical data carriers (for<br>
example CDs, CD-ROM, DVD etc.).<br>
The devices 1202 and 1204 each have a device 1206 and 1208, respectively, for<br>
accommodating a card module 1210. Each of the devices 1202 and 1204 also<br>
has a design which corresponds to the details illustrated in figures 16 and 17,<br>
i.e. in particular a decoder 1212 and 1214 is respectively provided. The other<br>
components which are necessary for billing, such as consumption measuring<br>
means, limiter, stored-value memory and consumption history, are not illus-<br>
trated.<br>
Fig. 27 illustrates, on the one hand, that the consumer (not illustrated) uses, by<br>
means of the device 1202, an item with an item identification 333 and in doing<br>
so has used in total 420% of, that is to say more than 4 times, the volume of the<br>
item. The privileges acquired by repeatedly playing back the item 333 are<br>
stored here on the card module 1210. If the user changes over to another<br>
device 1204 (in the rightâ€”hand half in figure 27) and requests again the item<br>
which is not present on the device 1204, with the result that said item has to be<br>
made available again by the server 110 via the WAN 210, this is coded in a<br>
different form for the decoder B. The acquired privileges nevertheless become<br>
effective through the insertion of the card module 1210 into the device 1204,<br>
with the result that, depending on the charge scheme model, the playing back<br>
of the item 333 again is considered, for example, degressively in a cumulative<br>
fashion, for example as being 600% at the end, and is correspondingly billed.<br>
The example in figure 27 shows that the same item can be made available<br>
encrypted in a different form in different devices and nevertheless can be called<br>
by means of the same card module 1210.<br>
Fig. 28 shows a schematic view of a scheme for managing and transmitting<br>
rights by means of a card module. Figure 28 illustrates that the same card<br>
module 1210 is capable of calling digital media content from one or more<br>
servers on different playback devices in different formats. As a result, the card<br>
module 1210 is illustrated in the left-hand part in conjunction with an MP3<br>
player, in order to play back sound signals or music, in the central part it is<br>
inserted into a set top box B, or a television set or some other terminal<br>
connected to the latter, in order to display video signals, and in the rightâ€”hand<br>
part in conjunction with an eâ€”book reader for displaying pages of text and/or<br>
pages of images.<br>
Fig. 29 shows a schematic view of another scheme for managing and trans-<br>
mitting rights by means of a card module. In particular there is an illustration<br>
here of module-related encryption which makes it possible to make telephone<br>
calls and transmit data online, and consume offline. The user requests an item<br>
from a multimedia content provider CPr1 via his telecommunications service<br>
using a telecommunications module (for example GSM or UMTS) which is<br>
equipped with a rights card. The rights card is additionally provided with an<br>
encryption module whose key type is known to the telecommunications<br>
service. The multimedia content provider CPr1 as a synergy partner of the<br>
telecommunications service inquires, from the telecommunications service<br>
using the telephone number of the end user, which key is to be used for this<br>
telephone number and transmits its item directly to the end user together with<br>
the corresponding encryption. Said end user can consume the item only using<br>
his rights card with the matching individual decryption module, either in life-<br>
streaming mode or offline in the viewing mode. Billing is performed via the<br>
telecommunications service.<br>
A device for using and billing for the use of digital content is designated by the<br>
reference 1410. A technical IT infrastructure of a telecommunications provider<br>
is designated by the reference symbol 1415. Technical IT infrastructures of<br>
content providers for files with digital (multimedia) content are designated by<br>
the references 1420A, 1420B, 1420C or 1420D.<br>
Fig. 30 shows a flowchart of a downloading process in conjunction with<br>
Fig. 31 shows various possible solutions for implementing the invention. In the<br>
simplest and least reliable case, the entire encryption of the media files and of<br>
the user data and charge scheme data is carried out on a conventional PC by<br>
means of a software solution. In order to increase the reliability, said PC can<br>
additionally communicate with a token solution, for example a chipcard. The<br>
highest level of security is obtained with an integrated terminal which is as far<br>
as possible encapsulated (appliance solution, for example MP3 player), in which<br>
opening causes data to be lost.<br>
Universal mobile device<br>
Fig. 32 shows an advantageous digital mobile device in a particular<br>
embodiment as a wearable computer 127010, which can be used in particular<br>
as a multimedia player, preferably including a digital rights management<br>
system (DRMS). The mobile device 127010 may have a PCMCIA slot 127020<br>
which can be used in particular for holding a smartcard chipcard, for example<br>
for distribution and payment systems.<br>
The PCMCIA interface can thus also be used for other functionalities or expan-<br>
sions, for example for adapter cards for smart media modules or similar storage<br>
cards, processor cards or other software and/or hardware expansions. It is then<br>
also possible to equip the mobile device 127010 with a mobile phone function-<br>
ality, for example WAP, SMS, GSM, GAPS, UMTS.<br>
One embodiment is to embody a PCMCIA card as a decoder module for digital<br>
rights management with an integrated memory, smartcard reader and/or<br>
means for making telephone calls and/or for data communication/data trans-<br>
mission using WAN (GSM, UMTS, GPRS etc.). In addition, it is advantageous to<br>
provide customary functions of a personal digital assistant (PDA) such as<br>
appointment planning, notes etc.<br>
These can also be implemented in the mobile device 127010 itself, in the<br>
display and operator control part 127030 or in a connection module, for<br>
example 127020.<br>
All the functions can, if appropriate, be used individually or in combination.<br>
Further functionalities are also possible. The disclosed content of<br>
PCT/EP 01/03738, in particular the description of particular embodiments of<br>
wearable computers, is herewith expressly made the subject matter of this<br>
patent application.<br>
The reference 127030 designates a display and operator control unit. The<br>
display and operator control unit 127030 has a display 127040 which is used for<br>
displaying texts and graphics, including videos, of the applications which run on<br>
the mobile device 127010. The connection between the mobile device 127010<br>
and the display and operator control unit 127030 can also be made by means of<br>
a cable (not illustrated), but a cableless data communications connection, for<br>
example by means of radio waves using, for example, the Bluetooth standard<br>
or by means of infrared data transmission using, for example, the IrDA<br>
standard, is preferred. The display and operator control unit 127030 can<br>
advantageously also be provided with an audio subsystem, for example an<br>
earpiece/microphone combination 127050. For pure hearing purposes, it is also<br>
possible to use, for example, a HiFi headset. In another variant (not illustrated),<br>
the microphone can also be integrated into the display and operator control unit<br>
127030.<br>
The display and operator control unit 127030 is advantageously dimensioned in<br>
such a way that it can be comfortably held in the hand. If the display and<br>
operator control unit 127030 is embodied with a touch screen, the user can<br>
easily carry out input operations with the thumb of the hand with which he is<br>
holding the unit. Alternatively, operator control using an input pen (not illus-<br>
trated) can also be provided. In one development, the microphone/headset<br>
127050 has a switching device 127060 with which, for example, music playback<br>
can be switched off and an incoming telephone call connected. After the end of<br>
the telephone call, the music playback can be switched on again by activating<br>
again.<br>
The display and operator control unit 127030 can be equipped with its own<br>
processor or control device and its own rechargeable battery. For this reason,<br>
in this variant the playback software can run directly on the display and<br>
operator control unit 127030. As a result, it is in particular possible to resolve<br>
copy-protected data formats only in the display and operator control unit<br>
127030 and feed them to the earpiece. The encryption of the data stream<br>
between the mobile device 127010 and the display and operator control unit<br>
127030 can be carried out, for example, by means of the SSL protocol. With<br>
such a configuration, the item decoder (not illustrated) can be provided with the<br>
digital rights management system in the mobile device 127010 without there<br>
being a risk of unauthorized copying. In this embodiment, it is possible, for<br>
example, to stream content from the wearable computer to a player or browser<br>
installed for that purpose in the display and operator control unit, for as long as<br>
the preconditions for this are fulfilled, for example by means of a connected<br>
rights smartcard in the wearable part or in the display and operator control part.<br>
One particular embodiment of the display and operator control unit is the<br>
possibility of representing the operator control function of the piece of<br>
equipment to be controlled and the possibility of displaying, for example,<br>
multimedia content which have just been played back, together with associated<br>
information such as title, amount of stored value, playing time etc., or lists of<br>
multimedia items which can be played back or ordered. With a multifunctional<br>
embodiment of the display and operator control unit, for example both as a<br>
media player and as a mobile telephone, it is possible to switch to and fro<br>
automatically between displaying, for example, telephone numbers and<br>
displaying titles which are being played at that particular time, or titles which<br>
are available or can be ordered, depending on the operating mode or in<br>
response to an input. If a telephone call is being made at that particular time,<br>
the subscriber can be displayed or even represented by an image, and if, for<br>
example, a piece of music is being played (suppressed during a telephone call),<br>
corresponding information is presented on the display.<br>
The mobile device 127010 can interact, via a LAN data connection, with other<br>
devices such as an e-book reader, PDA, web tablet, PC or beamer in the same<br>
or similar form, if provisions are made for that purpose. The mobile device can<br>
also interact with the Internet via a WAN connection other than a wirefree one<br>
by GSM, GPRS, UMTS etc., said connection being for example by analog<br>
telephone line, by ISDN line or by DSL.<br>
Fig. 32B shows a side view of the mobile device 127010. For pleasant carrying<br>
comfort when the mobile device is attached to a belt for clothing (not illus-<br>
trated), the housing has an ergonomic shape which has a depression 127070 on<br>
the side facing the belt. For reasons of convenience, rechargeable batteries (not<br>
illustrated) are advantageously arranged in the lower region of the housing.<br>
An embodiment in which the housing can rotate approximately relatively on the<br>
belt by means of a connection part (not illustrated) so that it can always<br>
orientate itself in the direction of gravity is particularly advantageous.<br>
Customary peripherals, for example printers etc., can be connected to the<br>
mobile device 127010 in a developed embodiment.<br>
Fig. 33 shows the display and operator control unit 127040 from fig. 32. In a<br>
particularly preferred development, the display and operator control unit<br>
127040 has, on the upper and lower end sides 128010a, 128010b, in each case<br>
a plug-in and latchable device (not illustrated) by means of which a cover<br>
module 128020 can be pushed and locked onto the display and operator control<br>
unit 127040, and possibly also establish electrical connection with it. In one<br>
specific embodiment, the cover module 128020 is equipped with a telephone<br>
keypad and has a viewing window for displaying the display and operator<br>
control unit 127040, and may have an earpiece and microphone (not illus-<br>
trated), if the microphone is not included in the display and operator control<br>
unit 127040.<br>
The cover module 128020 may be embodied in a wide and fashionable range of<br>
shapes and colors. The purpose is:<br>
a) to permit the user to make a telephone call in the same way as he is<br>
used to from a conventional mobile telephone, and<br>
b) to permit a device which is originally configured as a playback device to<br>
be possibly subsequently easily retrofitted to form a mobile telephone,<br>
or vice versa.<br>
The cover module 128020 is, in the connectable embodiment, able to be<br>
plugged from above or below onto the display and operator control unit 127040<br>
depending on the left-handedness or right-handedness of the user. What<br>
appears on the display of the display and operator control unit 127040 is corre-<br>
spondingly automatically orientated so that texts and images can always be<br>
read. In a simplified embodiment, this feature can also be omitted. A further<br>
advantageous possible embodiment of the display and operator control unit is<br>
the lateral formation of input or operator control elements facing away from the<br>
display, at the edge of the display, with which the display and operator control<br>
unit 127040 can both be held with a hand and operated. One particular<br>
embodiment is to implement the input feature by means of at least three input<br>
pushbutton keys, permitting certain basic functions, for example leafing,<br>
scrolling and the triggering of marked functions or menus. The position and<br>
number of the plug-in and the latchable connections (if present) and the input<br>
possibilities may vary in an individual case.<br>
The plug-in connection is particularly advantageous by virtue of the possibility<br>
of connecting to an accommodating means, for example in vehicles (not illus-<br>
trated), the operator control and the inputting and outputting of sound taking<br>
place via the same interface as that of the cover module. The advantage of the<br>
separate display and operator control unit 127040 is in particular the compact<br>
design which can be made very lightweight.<br>
In mobile radio applications, the GSM or UMTS transmission antenna can be<br>
arranged at a distance from for particularly sensitive body parts such as the<br>
head by mounting it on the mobile device 127010 which can possibly even be<br>
positioned away from the body, for example on a table.<br>
The display and operator control unit and the wearable part (computer) may<br>
also be embodied in one piece, provided that the disclosed embodiments<br>
and/or functionalities, for example a DRM solution using a smart module and/or<br>
PCMCIA module, reception and/or transmission module for telephony, media<br>
player and PDA combination, remote controls for terminals and/or a lid with<br>
viewing window solution are implemented.<br>
Of course, the embodiment of a handheld mobile device with a cover which can<br>
be unfolded and folded closed or folded over and which has a viewing window<br>
for the display below it is possible in a wide variety of embodiments. The<br>
advantageous cover with a viewing window serves as the basis for an<br>
independent inventive idea. The advantage of the viewing window in the<br>
folding cover of mobile, handheld devices is in particular to permit a display<br>
which is present to be read even when the protective cover is closed, and other<br>
functionalities can be made possible by closing the lid or the functionality of the<br>
mobile device can be expanded by folding over the lid, without a further display<br>
being required for this purpose. As a result, the use of the lid therefore covers<br>
all mobile handheld devices with functionalities which are specified in this<br>
disclosure, for example PDA, telephony (wirefree and/or using cables) and/or<br>
media player with or without a remote control function. It is also possible to<br>
embody the particular design of cover to be permanently associated with one<br>
mobile display and operator control part, regardless of whether the display and<br>
operator control part is embodied in one piece with a control unit or in more<br>
than one piece with an external wearable computer.<br>
Fig. 34 shows the possibility of using the display and operator control unit<br>
127040 from fig. 32 for different pieces of equipment and applications. The<br>
display and operator control unit 127040 can always be kept ready for use on<br>
the person or in the vicinity of the person and can cooperate with numerous<br>
other electronic devices within the distance which can be spanned using, for<br>
example, Bluetooth or infrared (IrDA). For example for monitoring houses,<br>
games consoles, television set, fixed network telephone, set top box, video<br>
recorder, multimedia player, mobile telephone or PDA. Furthermore, fig. 34<br>
shows a fixed version 129010 which is similar to the mobile device with the<br>
same functional and technical embodiment possibilities, including that of<br>
streaming DRM-protected content onto corresponding display components.<br>
The difference with respect to the mobile device 127010 from fig. 32 is that, for<br>
example, relatively large hard disk storage systems can be readily integrated.<br>
Furthermore, with the fixed version 129010, a fixed network connection possi-<br>
bility and a satellite communication connection possibility are provided as a<br>
primary WAN connection, while in the case of the mobile device it is preferably<br>
GSM, UMTS or a fixed network. In the fixed variant 129010 it is possible to<br>
provide an external audio output since it is advantageous to separate image<br>
and sound from one another by means of a digital rights management system.<br>
The display and operator control unit 127040, described above, of the mobile<br>
device can also be used to perform operator control of the fixed station, which<br>
is advantageous for the user since he can carry out operator control and display<br>
functions, and have them displayed, in the usual way using his universal display<br>
unit, without requiring another remote control. A further advantage of the<br>
display and operator control unit 127040 is that it is possible both to perform<br>
operator control of different devices, as shown, and to receive audio channels<br>
without having to pass via the external output of the fixed device, to which<br>
external output loudspeaker systems are usually connected (remote control<br>
with headset).<br>
A wide variety of applications, for example monitoring of a house, games<br>
console, television set, fixed network telephone, set top box, video recorder,<br>
multimedia player, mobile telephone or PDA, can also run on the fixed station<br>
129010.<br>
The display and operator control unit 127040 detects advantageously if it is in<br>
range of a signed-on terminal for which it can perform operator control. In the<br>
display, a corresponding symbol is then displayed for the terminals which can<br>
be respectively operated. If different transmission paths, for example a fixed<br>
network or radio network for the transmission of signals between the display<br>
and operator control unit 127040 and the respective terminal are possible, in<br>
one particularly preferred embodiment the respectively most cost-effective<br>
transmission is selected. When it is used as a telephone, the display and<br>
operator control unit 127040 uses a uniform address and telephone number<br>
register and decides, depending on the telephone number of the subscriber<br>
participating in the call, which transmission path is selected as the most<br>
favorable or better one.<br>
All the functions of the display and operator control unit can also be triggered<br>
by means of voice command control, irrespective of whether said unit is<br>
embodied in one part or two parts.<br>
The reference 129020 designates the PCMCIA module which represents, in one<br>
embodiment, a digital rights management system (DRMS) with decoder<br>
function and which can easily be connected to and fro between the fixed station<br>
129010 and the mobile device 127010. In particular the functionalities 129030<br>
can be supported by the DRMS. As in the case of the mobile device, the<br>
PCMCIA module can be embodied with a smartcard reader and/or an internal<br>
data memory for storing, for example, licenses, DRM software, decoder<br>
software, player software, browser, rights information, status information, user<br>
privileges and/or consumer histories in as far as these are not implemented by<br>
means of hardware technology or are provided at all. Of course, the entire<br>
disclosure content of the possibilities described above, in particular of the<br>
distribution and payment system and its aspects can be applied in various<br>
embodiments either for the mobile or fixed solution.<br>
Fig. 35 shows a preferred embodiment of the distribution and payment possi-<br>
bilities described above, in the form of a PCMCIA card with a smartcard reader,<br>
which permits, by interacting with a playback device, the consumption of<br>
protected multimedia data, with a corresponding basis for the billing of this<br>
data.<br>
Fig. 47 shows a schematic block diagram of a further device according to the<br>
invention for distributing, playing back, billing and paying for digital media<br>
content.<br>
A provider of digital media content (not illustrated) operates a server computer<br>
which is connected via a digital network, for example via the Internet (not illus-<br>
trated), to a media playback component 4720 which is located at the media<br>
consumer end (not illustrated). In the exemplary embodiment depicted the<br>
media playback component 4720 is an audio player with at least one<br>
loudspeaker or headset 4722 which obtains digital audio data from the server<br>
4710 by means of a streaming protocol, and converts them into sound which<br>
can be perceived by the media consumer. Of course, the invention is not<br>
restricted to audio media; it is likewise also possible to distribute and consume<br>
video media, electronic books or other media content in modified embodi-<br>
ments, a precondition being corresponding display means.<br>
The playback function of the media playback component 4720 is dependent on<br>
control signals of a transaction control component 4730 which transmits an<br>
enable signal (not illustrated) to the media playback component 4720 only if<br>
billing of the consumed media content in accordance with the charge scheme is<br>
ensured. For this purpose, firstly sufficiently secure identification and authenti-<br>
cation of the media consumer are necessary. An identification and authenti-<br>
cation component 4740 is connected to the transaction control component 4730<br>
and has a suitable user interface (not illustrated) with which the media<br>
consumer can identify and authenticate himself. In a very simple variant this<br>
may take place, for example, by the media consumer being required to enter<br>
his user name and his password by a request on a display (not illustrated). If the<br>
entered user name and the entered password correspond to a pair composed<br>
of the user name and password which are securely stored in the identification<br>
and authentication component 4740, it is assumed that the entered user name<br>
matches and that all the further media consumption actions are to be billed to<br>
this media consumer who is identified in this way. In an advanced variant of the<br>
identification and authentication component 4740 it is also possible for a<br>
hardware token 4745, for example a smartcard, to be used to secure the identi-<br>
fying and authenticating process. Other authentication means such as, for<br>
example, fingerprint, voice recognition and/or other known biometric identifi-<br>
cation and authentication means may also be provided.<br>
In addition, the transaction control component 4730 is connected to a money<br>
transfer control component 4750. The money transfer control component 4750<br>
accepts, from the transaction control component 4730, instructions relating to<br>
amounts of money for which the media consumer is to be billed, and signals to<br>
the transaction control component 4730 whether the billing of these amounts of<br>
money has been completed, or if it is at least to be considered as secured. The<br>
transaction control component 4730 controls the media playback component<br>
4720 in a specific way so that the media consumption is interrupted as soon as<br>
the money transfer control component 4750 no longer signals that the billing of<br>
the amounts of money which are owed by the media consumer has been<br>
completed, or is at least to be considered as secured. The money transfer<br>
control component 4750 is preferably connected to a first computer system<br>
4760 of a financial institution at which the media provider or a billing entity<br>
commissioned by the provider has an account, as well as to a second computer<br>
system 4765 of a financial institution at which the media consumer has an<br>
account. This connection may be made, in particular, via the customary billing<br>
data centers of the banks or the credit card company. If necessary, the money<br>
transfer control component triggers the transfer of a specific amount of money<br>
from the account of the media consumer to the account of the media provider<br>
or the billing entity commissioned by him.<br>
In order to avoid rapid repetition of a large number of money transactions for<br>
very small amounts of money, which unnecessarily increase the money transfer<br>
costs, it is expedient to allocate the media consumer a credit framework, to<br>
demand payment in advance or to combine both and provide a money account<br>
memory 4755 in which a number is stored which corresponds to the amount<br>
which is owed by the media consumer, or to the amount paid in advance which<br>
is associated with the media consumer. The money transfer control component<br>
4750 can then preferably be configured in such a way that a money transfer<br>
order which is effective to the outside with respect to the computer systems<br>
4760 and 4765 of the financial institute is issued only from time to time if a<br>
predefined available credit limit of the media consumer has been reached or<br>
exceeded by continued media consumption, or if an advance payment which<br>
has been made by the media consumer has been used up. In addition, a bonus<br>
point storage component 4735 in which at least one number (bonus point<br>
number), which corresponds to units of financial value accrued to the media<br>
consumer without however expressing an amount of money in a national<br>
currency, is stored is connected to the transaction control system 4730. The<br>
charge scheme for media consumption actions which are carried out by the<br>
media consumer and the generation of additional bonus points, dependent on<br>
these consumption actions, in the bonus point storage component 4735 is<br>
carried out in particular in accordance with the principles and features specified<br>
in parts of the description above. An alternative embodiment is described in<br>
figures 16 and 17.<br>
In order to make the use of the media as simple as possible for the media<br>
consumer, in one preferred embodiment there is provision for, for example, the<br>
media provider to make available a catalogue server 4770 with a search<br>
component (search engine) 4775. By means of the catalogue server 4770 with<br>
the search component (search engine) 4775, the media consumer can<br>
comfortably search through the offer of the media provider, for example by<br>
reference to data relating to the title, composer, genre, album and/or<br>
performers. When less extensive information is made available, an alphabetic<br>
index may be sufficient; in the case of very extensive amounts of information a<br>
full text search is advantageous. If the media consumer has found, by means of<br>
the catalogue server 4770 and the search engine 4775, an item which is of<br>
interest to him, he can set up a data record for this item in an item list 4780 by<br>
means of suitable dialogs at the operator interface (not illustrated). Beyond<br>
listening to or viewing samples, the media playback component 4720 can be<br>
activated only by means of the item list 4780; the media consumer cannot<br>
consume an item for which there is no data record in the item list 4780.<br>
Conversely, the generation of a data record for a specific item in the item list<br>
4780 does not necessarily mean that a charge-incurring consumption action<br>
has to be carried out. The item list 4780 instead constitutes a data structure<br>
which combines data on those items which the media consumer considers<br>
potentially interesting. From the results list of the search component it is<br>
possible to play back items for a predetermined time, for example.<br>
However, the item list 4780 serves not only as a notes memory merely for<br>
item-specific information such as author or title, it also constitutes the basis for<br>
item-specific management of the item usage options by the media consumer.<br>
In particular it is preferably possible for information to be stored for each item in<br>
the item list 4780, indicating:<br>
- whether any use of the respective item is consumption-dependent, that is<br>
to say is billed as a function for example of time or volume, or whether the item<br>
is classified as "obtained free of charge" according to the applicable charge<br>
scheme rules, i.e. the item can be consumed to an unlimited degree without<br>
further billing;<br>
- whether a physical copy of the respective item has been acquired at a price<br>
which is reduced according to the charge scheme owing to a previous online<br>
use.<br>
Corresponding information can also be represented in the results list of the<br>
search component, in particular also information indicating whether items have<br>
already been registered, and if so in which item list.<br>
An operator control interface (not illustrated) which is assigned to the item list<br>
4780 can in particular also comprise measures for transmitting, by means of an<br>
item management component 4790 an order, reduced according to bonus<br>
points stored in the bonus point storage component 4735, for the purchase of a<br>
physical item to a dealer system 4795. In conjunction with the purchase<br>
process, the number of bonus points which is stored in the bonus points<br>
storage component 4735 is then reduced in accordance with the charge<br>
scheme. Conversely, in one preferred embodiment, it is also possible to<br>
provide for the media consumer to acquire, by purchasing, a physical item, for<br>
example an audio CD, a shop. If at least one item which is stored on the audio<br>
CD can also be called online via the server 4710, it is possible to provide for the<br>
media consumer to be allowed to note, in a corresponding item entry in the<br>
item list 4780, that according to the charge scheme it is possible for him to<br>
make online use of this item in future free of charge or under preferred condi-<br>
tions insofar as this does not take place automatically at the provider end, for<br>
example when a product is purchased, by means of suitable methods and/or<br>
technical provisions. The protection against misuse can be provided by the<br>
dealer feeding into the dealer system 4795 the purchasing action together with<br>
an item identification and together with the personal data of the media<br>
consumer, insofar as necessary, in order to uniquely identify him, so that the<br>
item management component 4790 can verify the purchasing action. Another<br>
form of protection against misuse may take the form of each purchased item,<br>
that is to say for example of each purchased audio CD, being provided with a<br>
uniquely defined, concealed code number. This code number may be imple-<br>
mented as a sufficiently large random number which is printed onto an accom-<br>
panying slip and covered with a nontransparent covering layer. The random<br>
number must have a number of digits which is such that the probability of<br>
being able to guess it as a function of the issue is sufficiently small for practical<br>
purposes. All the random numbers which are respectively issued as a code<br>
number are stored in a database in the dealer system. In addition, for each<br>
issued code number there is a note indicating whether or not it has already<br>
been used for a discount according to the charge scheme. The media consumer<br>
can then remove the nontransparent cover layer and transmit the code number<br>
into the item management component 4790 via a suitable operator control<br>
interface (not illustrated). The item management component 4790 transfers this<br>
code number to the dealer system 4795 where testing is carried out to<br>
determine whether it is a valid code number which is registered in the database<br>
and marked as unused. In such a discount transaction, the code number is<br>
marked in the database as used and in return a corresponding discount is<br>
entered in the respective data record (or in the case of a plurality of items it is<br>
also entered in a plurality of respective data records) in the item list 4780. It is<br>
also possible to make corresponding rights registration by means of a token<br>
solution, for example a smartcard. One embodiment variant provides for rights<br>
pertaining to an item (rights of use) to be stored, together with a uniquely<br>
defined item identification, directly on the smartcard. Here it is possible for the<br>
data to be accessed and modified only by the provider or the dealer system.<br>
The invention therefore makes it possible to combine the virtual online use of<br>
digitizable items and the acquisition of items by purchasing with one another in<br>
a most advantageous way. If the media consumer firstly starts with the online<br>
use of a specific item, the proposed technical infrastructure makes it possible<br>
for him, when this media consumption is billed in accordance with a charge<br>
scheme, to acquire a corresponding physical copy at a discounted rate.<br>
Conversely, if the media consumer firstly starts with the purchase of a physical<br>
copy, a discounted, possibly free-of-charge online access to the same item<br>
may be made possible for him according to the charge scheme.<br>
If the technical arrangement described above is operated in a way in which<br>
there is no provision for individual items to be "acquired free of charge",<br>
consumptionâ€”dependent billing in accordance with a charge scheme remains<br>
possible. In this case, a simple authentication with a password may be sufficient<br>
with respect to the identification and authentication component 4740, since the<br>
media consumer will then develop, on the basis of the cost consequences<br>
associated with each consumption action, a high degree of motivation to<br>
protect his access data and in particular not divulge it to third parties. The<br>
situation is different as soon as it is permitted to "acquire" items free of charge.<br>
By limiting the cost consequences there is the risk here of individual media<br>
consumers liberally passing on their access data to third parties. Under such<br>
circumstances, the hardware token 4745 which is difficult to simulate proves<br>
very advantageous for authentication purposes.<br>
Fig. 48 shows a schematic view of a development of the arrangement shown in<br>
fig. 47. Whereas only one catalogue server 4770 and one content server 4710 of<br>
an individual service provider was provided in each case in the arrangement<br>
shown in fig. 47, the development shown in fig. 48 includes corresponding<br>
computers of a plurality of service providers, specifically in each case one<br>
catalogue server 4770A, 4770B, 4770C, as well as in each case one streamer<br>
server 4710A, 4710B, 4710C of a first, second and third service provider. The<br>
media consumer accesses the individual provider-specific catalogue servers<br>
4770A, 4770B, 4770C, or the provider-specific streamer servers 4710A, 4710B,<br>
4710C, in this case via a multiâ€”provider portal with a metacatalogue server<br>
4770X and with a metastreamer server 4710X. One particular embodiment<br>
provides for individual providers to provide their products via the system<br>
described in fig. 47 and do the billing processes for them themselves, it being<br>
possible, for example, for online items which are acquired free of charge to be<br>
registered and played back not only in the item lists of the individual providers<br>
but also for all the corresponding items of a wide variety of providers to be<br>
registered and played back via a link to the metaportal in a type of universal<br>
item list. For this purpose the item list of the metaportal is used as a quasi -<br>
depot for all the items which can be acquired free of charge from various<br>
providers (for example publishing houses) and thus played back free of charge.<br>
A token solution which is preferably designed for this purpose, for example in<br>
the form of a smartcard, has the purpose of unambiguously authenticating a<br>
user, and prevents free-of-charge passing on of a PIN or password to third<br>
parties. The management of free-of-charge items by means of the item lists of<br>
the metaportal is particularly advantageous as the consumer can use individual<br>
publishing houses, but when he wishes only to consume he can preferably<br>
access the item list of the metaportal via one of the content providers or directly<br>
in order to play back all the items there which have been acquired free of<br>
charge, without having to change to and fro between the item lists of individual<br>
providers.<br>
Fig. 49 shows a schematic view of a development of the arrangement shown in<br>
fig. 48. Whereas no local storage of digital items is provided in the arrangement<br>
shown in fig. 48 and media consumption therefore always requires an online<br>
connection to a content server 4710, the development shown in fig. 49 includes<br>
an item memory component 4712 which is equipped with a sufficiently dimen-<br>
sioned mass storage medium (not illustrated) and in which content data of<br>
digital items which have been downloaded from one of the content servers<br>
4710 can be stored so that it can also be consumed offline by the media<br>
consumer, that is to say without an open online data network link. The local<br>
offline availability of an item in the item memory component 4712 is entered in<br>
the corresponding data record of the item list 4780 which is associated with the<br>
respective item. The various charge scheme modes according to the invention<br>
which are described above are also applied in offline consumption of items<br>
which are stored in the item memory component 4712. As no financial trans-<br>
actions can be performed via the financial institutions 4760, 4765 during offline<br>
consumption, in this variant the money account memory 4755 is not only<br>
advantageous but also necessary.<br>
In all the arrangements illustrated in figs 47, 48 and 49, a DRMS (not illustrated)<br>
is preferably used with an implementation component (not illustrated) in order<br>
to protect the digital content data against misuse.<br>
The arrangements illustrated in figs 47, 48 and 49 can be implemented techni-<br>
cally in a variety of ways. In particular, they can also be represented by<br>
computer programs running on universal computers. While the servers 4770,<br>
4710, 4760, 4765 and 4795 are generally embodied as computers which are<br>
installed and operated outside the sphere of the media consumer, the other<br>
components, with the exception of the token 4795, can be incorporated, for<br>
example, by software running on a PC. However, it is also possible to use<br>
particular application-specific devices which implement these components in<br>
another way, for example by means of suitable electronic circuits.<br>
Fig. 50 shows a schematic overview of a phase model for marketing multimedia<br>
products for purchase on the basis of the arrangements illustrated in figs 47 to<br>
49. Three phases are distinguished:<br>
a) Phase 1: an arrangement according to fig. 47 is typically applied in<br>
phase 1, three operator control steps being available on a provider-<br>
specific basis, that is to say without a multi-provider functionality;<br>
b) Phase 2: an arrangement according to fig. 48 is typically applied in<br>
phase 2 in which items which are "acquired free of charge" from various<br>
content providers can be combined, managed and played back on a<br>
multiâ€”provider basis.<br>
c) Phase 3: an arrangement according to fig. 49 is typically applied in<br>
phase 3 in which items from various content providers can be<br>
downloaded on a multi-provider basis onto a mass storage medium of<br>
a multimedia application of the media consumer, managed and played<br>
back either online or offline.<br>
Fig. 51A shows a schematic view of an exemplary operator control interface of<br>
a first aspect of a first substep according to the first phase of the phase model<br>
from fig. 50. A menu bar 5110 is displayed on a display device (not illustrated in<br>
more detail). The menu bar 5110 permits a search function to be activated,<br>
divided into categories of music items, videos, games and electronic books. An<br>
alphabetic index bar 5112 permits alphabetical index searching for the name of<br>
the performer by leafing through the alphabetic index. A corresponding alpha-<br>
betical index search is also possible according to other criteria such as the title<br>
of the item, the album, the genre etc (not illustrated in more detail). As a result<br>
of the search process, a result list 5115 appears in which all the items which are<br>
contained in the result quantity are listed in tabular form with one row each. In<br>
the case of an example from the "music" column, consecutive numbering, the<br>
title of the item, the name of the performer and the name of the album are<br>
given. In addition, a first operator control element 5115a is generated per item,<br>
the triggering of which first operator control element 5115a, for example by<br>
clicking on a mouse, causing the respective title to be displayed briefly for a<br>
time which is predetermined depending on the item, for example for<br>
30 seconds. In addition, a second operator control element 5115b is generated<br>
for each item, the triggering of which second operator control element 5115b<br>
causing, for example by clicking on a mouse, an item which has been searched<br>
for to be marked for later transferring to the "play list", that is to say in the item<br>
list 4780 from fig. 47. A direct transfer of individual items is also possible if an<br>
an operator control element (not illustrated) is provided for this purpose.<br>
Fig. 51B shows a schematic view of an exemplary operator control interface of<br>
a second aspect of the first substep according to the first phase of the phase<br>
model from fig. 50. The media consumer (not illustrated) has caused an appro-<br>
priate data record in the item list 4780 to be generated in the result list 5115 by<br>
triggering the second operator control element 5115b for a number of marked<br>
items 5117a, 5117b, 5117c, 5117d, and the consumer is provided with an online<br>
play list display 5120 on the operator control interface. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the online play list display 5120 may be configured in such a way<br>
that it can be sorted and/or grouped according to genres or user-defined<br>
categories 5122a, 5122b, 5122c, 5122d, 5122e.<br>
Fig. 51C shows a schematic view of an exemplary operator control interface of<br>
a second substep according to the first phase of the phase model from fig. 50. It<br>
is possible, for example by clicking on a mouse, to select and play back an<br>
individual item or an entire play list with a plurality of items from the online play<br>
list display 5120. The media playback component 4720 from fig. 47 then<br>
appears on the operator control interface in the form of an "online player" object<br>
5130 with the customary functionalities such as start/stop, fast forward, fast<br>
rewind. The playback function of the "online player" object 5130 is enabled only<br>
if the transaction control which is described in conjunction with figs 47, 48 and<br>
49 permits the money transfer according to regulations. When the playback<br>
function of the "online player" object 5130 is triggered by means of the corre-<br>
sponding operator control element, the consumption-orientated billing of<br>
charges for use starts, or, as shown in fig. 51C, the conversion of official<br>
payment means into content-provider-specific amounts of monetary value<br>
starts, and said amounts can advantageously be used only for purchasing<br>
products and/or services from the respective content provider.<br>
Fig. 51D shows a schematic view of an exemplary operator control interface of<br>
a first aspect of a third substep according to the first phase of the phase model<br>
from fig. 50. The item administration 4790 from fig. 47 appears on the operator<br>
control interface in the form of a "product manager" object with a product list<br>
5142 in which physical Copies of items which can be acquired, here by way of<br>
example CD albums, are listed and preferably illustrated by means of icons, in<br>
which it proves particularly advantageous to configure the icons in accordance<br>
with the front page of the CD booklets in order to ensure a high recognition<br>
effect. By clicking on an icon of the product list 5142, the respective icon in the<br>
product field 5144 is displayed. Operator control elements 5146a, 5146b, 5146c<br>
relating to the product field 5144 are generated in order to be able to trigger<br>
various commercial transactions relating to the CD album which is symbolized<br>
by the icon in the product field 5144. Triggering the first operator control<br>
element 4146a causes the number of bonus points which are stored in the<br>
bonus point storage component 4735 from fig. 47 to be reduced by 400, and as<br>
a result all the items of the album are acquired free of charge for online use,<br>
which is also marked in the item list. Triggering the second operator control<br>
element 4146b has the effect, in the case of rights of use which have already<br>
been previously acquired (see above), of reducing the number of bonus points<br>
stored in the bonus point storage component 4735 from fig. 47 by 800, and as a<br>
result a contractual promise of the content provider or of a commissioned<br>
intermediary agent to supply a physical copy of the respective album to the<br>
respective media consumer is triggered under the control of the item<br>
management component 4790 and of the dealer system 4795. Triggering of the<br>
third operator control element 4146c causes the stored value of the media<br>
consumer which is represented in the money account memory 4755 to be<br>
reduced by 15 Euros, and an order for a physical copy of the respective CD<br>
album from the content provider or from an intermediary agent which is<br>
commissioned by said provider is triggered, without the precondition of rights<br>
of use having been already acquired. For this purpose, the order is advanta-<br>
geously carried out by means of a goods basket (not illustrated). Of course,<br>
other products or services of the provider can also be purchased using the<br>
acquired points.<br>
Fig. 51E shows a schematic view of an exemplary operator control interface of<br>
a second aspect of the third substep according to the first phase of the phase<br>
model from fig. 50. After rights of use are acquired for all the items of the<br>
respective CD album by triggering the first operator control element 5146a, a<br>
data record is displayed in the online play list display 5120 of the media<br>
consumer ("Hans Mustermann") for each of the items contained in the CD<br>
album, said data record indicating that the rights of use have been acquired, i.e.<br>
that the item is "acquired free of charge". A play list with all the titles on the<br>
album is advantageously created automatically. Titles which are already located<br>
in individual item lists are also marked and if they are included on the album<br>
which has been acquired free of charge they can be played back free of charge.<br>
Of course, the relationships explained above with reference to a CD album can<br>
also readily be transferred to other digitizable media such as, for example,<br>
videos or electronic books.<br>
An on-demand distribution of digital content, for example via a data network<br>
such as the Internet or via a terrestrial transmitter channel or via a cable channel<br>
or satellite channel proves extremely broadband intensive, in particular if<br>
relatively small numbers of different items are requested by a large number of<br>
individual users at different times. There is therefore in practice a considerable<br>
need to propose a device which saves broadband capacity, or a corresponding<br>
method which saves broadband capacity.<br>
In the inventive solution of this object it is possible to use a channel, for<br>
example a terrestrial transmitter channel, preferably during a certain first time<br>
window, for example from 09.00 a.m. local time to 24.00 p.m. local time for the<br>
continuous sequential emission of nonencrypted exert samples of digital items,<br>
referred to as trailers. The trailers can relate in particular to video films, audio<br>
media or games. By means of a device according to the invention, for example<br>
in the form of what is referred to as a set top box, it is possible for the media<br>
consumer to then view, during the day, the sequence of trailer emissions and<br>
finally arrive at a decision, after a process of deliberation, to view specific items,<br>
for example video films, associated with the individual trailers which have been<br>
seen, in the long version on the next day, for example. With the method<br>
according to the invention, the media consumer then indicates, during the<br>
running time of the corresponding trailer, that he wishes to consume the<br>
corresponding long version by activating an operator control means which may<br>
be arranged, for example, on the set top box or on a remote control which is<br>
associated with the set top box. For this purpose, a remote control (not illus-<br>
trated) which is equipped with a display, such as has been presented before as<br>
a universal remote control in figs 32 to 34, is advantageous. On the display it is<br>
possible to display corresponding item identifications such as, for example,<br>
titles and to trigger, by means of a direct key, a function which carries out a<br>
setting in the set top box. This may be a filter setting which makes it possible to<br>
detect and download an item which is to be transmitted later by broadcast.<br>
Other items which are not marked in the set top box are not permitted for<br>
downloading. Another possibility is to preset a time window setting, trans-<br>
mitted with the trailer, for example, which makes it possible to receive a specific<br>
program at a specific time on a predetermined channel, which program is<br>
transmitted in unaddressed form by means of a broadcast mode. It is optionally<br>
possible for the device, for example in the form of the set top box, to forward<br>
the consumption request via a suitable back channel, for example via a<br>
telephone line or via the Internet, to a server of the content provider. During a<br>
second time window, for example from 01.00 a.m. local time to 08.00 a.m. local<br>
time, the server of the content provider distributes the digital content requested<br>
by the individual media consumers, via the same channel which was used for<br>
distributing the trailers during the first time window. The set top box is then<br>
configured with a mass storage medium (for example a hard disk with a<br>
capacity of 160Gbytes) and a control unit in such a way that it is possible,<br>
during this second time window, to filter out, from the set of all the digital items<br>
which are emitted in encrypted form in the broadcast mode, those items whose<br>
trailers the media consumer had marked during the first time window, and to<br>
store said items in encrypted form on the hard disk. During this automatic<br>
downloading and storage process, there is no need for any operator control<br>
intervention on the part of the media consumer whatsoever. At the latest after<br>
the second time window has been terminated, all the digital items which are<br>
ordered by the media consumer are stored on the hard disk and can be<br>
consumed by the consumer after decryption. It is advantageous to protect the<br>
content data by means of a DMRS and to identify and authenticate the<br>
authorized media consumer before access to the content data; the latter being<br>
preferably again carried out by means of a hardware token, for example by<br>
means of a smartcard.<br>
Fig. 53A shows a schematic view of a device and a method for broadcast<br>
distribution of digital content in a first method step. On a channel 5210, product<br>
presentations with trailers are broadcast continuously in broadcast mode<br>
during the first time window from 09.00 a.m. to 24.00 a.m. Between the trailers<br>
it is possible, where necessary, also to intersperse blocks of advertisements. In<br>
a still further improved variant it is possible to provide the media consumer with<br>
monetary advantages, for example in the form of bonus points, for consuming<br>
these blocks of advertisements. A variant which is improved even more is<br>
defined by the fact that a specific symbol, for example a number or a combi-<br>
nation of letters, is included in each block of advertisements (advertisement).<br>
The media consumer is then awarded bonus points in this ultimate<br>
improvement only if during the inputting or within a short time window after-<br>
wards he inputs the symbol which is recognized by him, for example by means<br>
of a keyboard provided in the remote control of the set top box, and in this way<br>
proves that he has actually consumed the block of advertisements. The channel<br>
5310 is evaluated by a set top box 5320 according to the invention. The<br>
individual trailers and the associated long versions can be identified by means<br>
of suitable measures, for example by means of a uniquely defined item<br>
identifier or by the specification of a precise time window during which the<br>
corresponding long version is broadcast. The consumer (not illustrated) marks<br>
the trailer A in the example shown by activating an operator control means on<br>
the operator control part (for example remote control) 5330 of the set top box<br>
5320. The trailers can be consumed, for example, by means of a screen 5340<br>
and/or a loudspeaker 5350.<br>
Fig. 53B shows a schematic view of a device and of a method for broadcast<br>
distribution of digital content in a second method step. On the channel 5210,<br>
the long versions corresponding to the trailers are broadcast encrypted in the<br>
broadcast mode during the second time window from 01.00 a.m. to 08.00 a.m.,<br>
and filtered out under the control of the control unit 5360 and stored in the<br>
storage module 5370.<br>
Fig. 53C shows a schematic view of a device and of a method for broadcast<br>
distribution of digital content in a third method step. By means of a token<br>
(smartcard), the authorized media consumer identifies and authenticates<br>
himself with respect to a clearing house from which a decoder-specific<br>
decryption key for the digital content stored in the storage module 5370 is<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 53D shows a schematic view of a device and of a method for broadcast<br>
distribution of digital content in a fourth method step. The digital content, for<br>
example a video film associated with the trailer A, which is stored in the storage<br>
module 5370 can be decrypted and consumed under the control of the control<br>
unit 5360.<br>
