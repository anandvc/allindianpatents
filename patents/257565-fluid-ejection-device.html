Cross-Reference To Related Applications This application is related to Patent Application Serial No. [Not Yet Assigned], Attorney Docket No. 200210152-1, entitled "Fluid Ejection Device," Patent Application Serial No. [Not Yet Assigned], Attorney Docket No. 200208780-1, entitled "Fluid Ejection Device With Address Generator," Patent Application Serial No. [Not Yet Assigned], No. 200311485-1, entitled "Device With Gates Configured In Loop Structures," Patent Application Serial No. [Not Yet Assigned], No. 200209559-1, entitled "Fluid Ejection Device," and Patent Application Serial No. [Not Yet Assigned], Attorney Docket No. 200209237-1, entitled "Fluid Ejection Device With Identification Cells," each of which are assigned to the Assignee of this application and are filed on even date herewith, and each of which is fully incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
Background An inkjet printing system, as one embodiment of a fluid ejection system, may include a printhead, an ink supply that provides liquid ink to the printhead, and an electronic controller that controls the printhead. The printhead, as one embodiment of a fluid ejection device, ejects ink drops through a plurality of orifices or nozzles. The ink is projected toward a print medium, such as a sheet of paper, to print an image onto the print medium. The nozzles are typically arranged in one or more arrays, such that properly sequenced ejection of ink from the nozzles causes characters or other images to be printed on the print medium as the printhead and the print medium are moved relative to each other.<br><br>
In a typical thermal inkjet printing system, the printhead ejects ink drops through nozzles by rapidly heating small volumes of ink located in vaporization chambers. The ink is heated with small electric heaters, such as thin film resistors referred to herein as firing resistors. Heating the ink causes the ink to vaporize and be ejected through the nozzles.<br>
To eject one drop of ink, the electronic controller that controls the printhead activates an electrical current from a power supply external to the printhead. The electrical current is passed through a selected firing resistor to heat the ink in a corresponding selected vaporization chamber and eject the ink through a corresponding nozzle. Known drop generators include a firing resistor, a corresponding vaporization chamber, and a corresponding nozzle.<br>
As inkjet printheads have evolved, the number of drop generators in a printhead has increased to improve printing speed and/or quality. The increase in the number of drop generators per printhead has resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of input pads required on a printhead die to energize the increased number of firing resistors. In one type of printhead, each firing resistor is coupled to a corresponding input pad to provide power to energize the firing resistor. One input pad per firing resistor becomes impractical as the number of firing resistors increases.<br>
The number of drop generators per input pad is significantly increased in another type of printhead having primitives. A single power lead provides power to all firing resistors in one primitive. Each firing resistor is coupled in series with the power lead and the drain-source path of a corresponding field effect transistor (FET). The gate of each FET in a primitive is coupled to a separately energizable address lead that is shared by multiple primitives.<br>
Manufacturers continue reducing the number of input pads and increasing the number of drop generators on a printhead die. A printhead with fewer input pads typically costs less than a printhead with more input pads. Also, a printhead with more drop generators typically prints with higher quality and/or printing speed. To maintain costs and provide a particular printing swath height, printhead die size may not significantly change with an increased number of drop generators. As drop generator densities increase and the<br><br>
umber of input pads decrease, printhead die layouts can become increasingly omplex.<br>
For these and other reasons, there is a need for the present invention.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the I     accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as "top," "bottom," "front,"<br><br>
"back," leading," "trailing," etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described.   Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of an inkjet printing system 20. Inkjet printing system 20 constitutes one embodiment of a fluid ejection system that includes a fluid ejection device, such as inkjet printhead assembly 22, and a fluid supply assembly, such as ink supply assembly 24. The inkjet printing system 20 also includes a mounting assembly 26, a media transport assembly 28, and an electronic controller 30. At least one power supply 32 provides power to the various electrical components of inkjet printing system 20.<br>
In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 includes at least one printhead or printhead die 40 that ejects drops of ink through a plurality of orifices or nozzles 34 toward a print medium 36 so as to print onto print medium 36. Printhead 40 is one embodiment of a fluid ejection device. Print medium 36 may be any type of suitable sheet material, such as paper, card stock, transparencies, Mylar, fabric, and the like. Typically, nozzles 34 are arranged in one or more columns or arrays such that properly sequenced ejection of ink from nozzles 34 causes characters, symbols, and/or other graphics or images to be printed upon print medium 36 as inkjet printhead assembly 22 and print medium 36 are moved relative to each other. While the following description refers to the ejection of ink from printhead assembly 22, it is understood that other liquids, fluids or flowable materials, including clear fluid, may be ejected from printhead assembly 22.<br>
Ink supply assembly 24 as one embodiment of a fluid supply assembly provides ink to printhead assembly 22 and includes a reservoir 38 for storing ink. As such, ink flows from reservoir 38 to inkjet printhead assembly 22. Ink<br><br>
supply assembly 24 and Inkjet printhead assembly 22 can form either a one-way ink delivery system or a recirculating ink delivery system. In a one-way ink delivery system, substantially all of the ink provided to inkjet printhead assembly 22 is consumed during printing. In a recirculating ink delivery system, only a portion of the ink provided to printhead assembly 22 is consumed during printing. As such, ink not consumed during printing is returned to ink supply assembly 24.<br>
In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 and ink supply assembly 24 are housed together in an inkjet cartridge or pen. The inkjet cartridge or pen is one embodiment of a fluid ejection device. In another embodiment, ink supply assembly 24 is separate from inkjet printhead assembly 22 and provides ink to inkjet printhead assembly 22 through an interface connection, such as a supply tube (not shown). In either embodiment, reservoir 38 of ink supply assembly 24 may be removed, replaced, and/or refilled. In one embodiment, where inkjet printhead assembly 22 and ink supply assembly 24 are housed together in an inkjet cartridge, reservoir 38 includes a local reservoir located within the cartridge and may also include a larger reservoir located separately from the cartridge. As such, the separate, larger reservoir serves to refill the local reservoir. Accordingly, the separate, larger reservoir and/or the local reservoir may be removed, replaced, and/or refilled.<br>
Mounting assembly 26 positions inkjet printhead assembly 22 relative to media transport assembly 28 and media transport assembly 28 positions print medium 36 relative to inkjet printhead assembly 22. Thus, a print zone 37 is defined adjacent to nozzles 34 in an area between inkjet printhead assembly 22 and print medium 36. In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 is a scanning type printhead assembly. As such, mounting assembly 26 includes a carriage (not shown) for moving inkjet printhead assembly 22 relative to media transport assembly 28 to scan print medium 36. In another embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 is a non-scanning type printhead assembly. As such, mounting assembly 26 fixes inkjet printhead assembly 22 at a prescribed position relative to media transport assembly 28. Thus, media transport assembly 28 positions print medium 36 relative to inkjet printhead assembly 22.<br><br>
Electronic controller or printer controller 30 typically includes a processor, firmware, and other electronics, or any combination thereof, for communicating with and controlling inkjet printhead assembly 22, mounting assembly 26, and media transport assembly 28. Electronic controller 30 receives data 39 from a host system, such as a computer, and usually includes memory for temporarily storing data 39. Typically, data 39 is sent to inkjet printing system 20 along an electronic, infrared, optical, or other information transfer path. Data 39 represents, for example, a document and/or file to be printed. As such, data 39 forms a print job for inkjet printing system 20 and includes one or more print job commands and/or command parameters.<br>
In one embodiment, electronic controller 30 controls inkjet printhead assembly 22 for ejection of ink drops from nozzles 34. As such, electronic controller 30 defines a pattern of ejected ink drops that form characters, symbols, and/or other graphics or images on print medium 36. The pattern of ejected ink drops is determined by the print job commands and/or command parameters.<br>
In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 includes one printhead 40. In another embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 is a wide-array or multi-head printhead assembly. In one wide-array embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 includes a carrier, which carries printhead dies 40, provides electrical communication between printhead dies 40 and electronic controller 30, and provides fluidic communication between printhead dies 40 and ink supply assembly 24.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating a portion of one embodiment of a printhead die 40. The printhead die 40 includes an array of printing or fluid ejecting elements 42. Printing elements 42 are formed on a substrate 44, which has an ink feed slot 46 formed therein. As such, ink feed slot 46 provides a supply of liquid ink to printing elements 42. Ink feed slot 46 is one embodiment of a fluid feed source. Other embodiments of fluid feed sources include but are not limited to corresponding individual ink feed holes feeding corresponding vaporization chambers and multiple shorter ink feed trenches that each feed corresponding groups of fluid ejecting elements. A thin-film structure 48 has an<br><br>
ink feed channel 54 formed therein which communicates with ink feed slot 46 formed in substrate 44. An orifice layer 50 has a front face 50a and a nozzle opening 34 formed in front face 50a. Orifice layer 50 also has a nozzle chamber or vaporization chamber 56 formed therein which communicates with nozzle opening 34 and ink feed channel 54 of thin-film structure 48. A firing resistor 52 is positioned within vaporization chamber 56 and leads 58 electrically couple firing resistor 52 to circuitry controlling the application of electrical current through selected firing resistors. A drop generator 60 as referred to herein includes firing resistor 52, nozzle chamber or vaporization chamber 56 and nozzle opening 34.<br>
During printing, ink flows from ink feed slot 46 to vaporization chamber 56 via ink feed channel 54. Nozzle opening 34 is operatively associated with firing resistor 52 such that droplets of ink within vaporization chamber 56 are ejected through nozzle opening 34 (e.g., substantially normal to the plane of firing resistor 52) and toward print medium 36 upon energizing of firing resistor 52.<br>
Example embodiments of printhead dies 40 include a thermal printhead, a piezoelectric printhead, an electrostatic printhead, or any other type of fluid ejection device known in the art that can be integrated into a multi-layer structure. Substrate 44 is formed, for example, of silicon, glass, ceramic, or a stable polymer and thin-film structure 48 is formed to include one or more passivation or insulation layers of silicon dioxide, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, tantalum, polysilicon glass, or other suitable material. Thin-film structure 48, also, includes at least one conductive layer, which defines firing resistor 52 and leads 58. In one embodiment, the conductive layer comprises, for example, aluminum, gold, tantalum, tantalum-aluminum, or other metal or metal alloy. In one embodiment, firing cell circuitry, such as described in detail below, is implemented in substrate and thin-film layers, such as substrate 44 and thin-film structure 48.<br>
In one embodiment, orifice layer 50 comprises a photoimageable epoxy resin, for example, an epoxy referred to as SU8, marketed by Micro-Chem, Newton, MA. Exemplary techniques for fabricating orifice layer 50 with SU8 or other polymers are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,162,589, which is<br><br>
herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, orifice layer 50 is formed of two separate layers referred to as a barrier layer (e,g., a dry film photo resist barrier layer) and a metal orifice layer (e.g., a nickel, copper, iron/nickel alloys, palladium, gold, or rhodium layer) formed over the barrier layer. Other suitable materials, however, can be employed to form orifice layer 50.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot 46 in one embodiment of printhead die 40. Ink feed slot 46 includes opposing ink feed slot sides 46a and 46b. Drop generators 60 are disposed along each of the opposing ink feed slot sides 46a and 46b. A total of n drop generators 60 are located along ink feed slot 46, with m drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot side 46a, and n - m drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot side 46b. In one embodiment, n equals 200 drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot 46 and m equals 100 drop generators 60 located along each of the opposing ink feed slot sides 46a and 46b. In other embodiments, any suitable number of drop generators 60 can be disposed along ink feed slot 46.<br>
Ink feed slot 46 provides ink to each of the n drop generators 60 disposed along ink feed slot 46. Each of the n drop generators 60 includes a firing resistor 52, a vaporization chamber 56 and a nozzle 34. Each of the n vaporization chambers 56 is fluidically coupled to ink feed slot 46 through at least one ink feed channel 54. The firing resistors 52 of drop generators 60 are energized in a controlled sequence to eject fluid from vaporization chambers 56 and through nozzles 34 to print an image on print medium 36.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a firing cell 70 employed in one embodiment of printhead die 40. Firing cell 70 includes a firing resistor 52, a resistor drive switch 72, and a memory circuit 74. Firing resistor 52 is part of a drop generator 60. Drive switch 72 and memory circuit 74 are part of the circuitry that controls the application of electrical current through firing resistor 52. Firing cell 70 is formed in thin-film structure 48 and on substrate 44.<br>
In one embodiment, firing resistor 52 is a thin-film resistor and drive switch 72 is a field effect transistor (FET). Firing resistor 52 is electrically coupled to a fire line 76 and the drain-source path of drive switch 72. The drain-<br><br>
source path of drive switch 72 is also electrically coupled to a reference line 78 that is coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground. The gate of drive switch 72 is electrically coupled to memory circuit 74 that controls the state of drive switch 72.<br>
Memory circuit 74 is electrically coupled to a data line 80 and enable lines 82. Data line 80 receives a data signal that represents part of an image and enable lines 82 receive enable signals to control operation of memory circuit 74. Memory circuit 74 stores one bit of data as it is enabled by the enable signals. The logic level of the stored data bit sets the state (e.g., on or off, conducting or non-conducting) of drive switch 72. The enable signals can include one or more select signals and one or more address signals.<br>
Fire line 76 receives an energy signal comprising energy pulses and provides an energy pulse to firing resistor 52. In one embodiment, the energy pulses are provided by electronic controller 30 to have timed starting times and timed duration to provide a proper amount of energy to heat and vaporize fluid in the vaporization chamber 56 of a drop generator 60. If drive switch 72 is on (conducting), the energy pulse heats firing resistor 52 to heat and eject fluid from drop generator 60. If drive switch 72 is off (non-conducting), the energy pulse does not heat firing resistor 52 and the fluid remains in drop generator 60.<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic diagram illustrating one embodiment of an inkjet printhead firing cell array, indicated at 100. Firing cell array 100 includes a plurality of firing cells 70 arranged into n fire groups 102a-102n. In one embodiment, firing cells 70 are arranged into six fire groups 102a-102n. In other embodiments, firing cells 70 can be arranged into any suitable number of fire groups 102a-102n, such as four or more fire groups 102a-102n.<br>
The firing cells 70 in array 100 are schematically arranged into L rows and m columns. The L rows of firing cells 70 are electrically coupled to enable lines 104 that receive enable signals. Each row of firing cells 70, referred to herein as a row subgroup or subgroup of firing cells 70, is electrically coupled to one set of subgroup enable lines 106a-106L The subgroup enable lines 106a-106L receive subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL that enable the corresponding subgroup of firing cells 70.<br><br>
The m columns are electrically coupled to m data lines 108a-108m that receive data signals D1, D2 ... Dm, respectively. Each of the m columns includes firing cells 70 in each of the n fire groups 102a-102n and each column of firing cells 70, referred to herein as a data line group or data group, is electrically coupled to one of the data lines 108a-108m. In other words, each of the data lines 108a-108m is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in one column, including firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n. For example, data line 108a is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in the far left column, including firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n. Data line 108b is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in the adjacent column and so on, over to and including data line 108m that is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in the far right column, including firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n.<br>
In one embodiment, array 100 is arranged into six fire groups 102a-102n and each of the six fire groups 102a-102n includes 13 subgroups and eight data line groups. In other embodiments, array 100 can be arranged into any suitable number of fire groups 102a-102n and into any suitable number of subgroups and data line groups. In any embodiment, fire groups 102a-102n are not limited to having the same number of subgroups and data line groups. Instead, each of the fire groups 102a-102n can have a different number of subgroups and/or data line groups as compared to any other fire group 102a-102n. In addition, each subgroup can have a different number of firing cells 70 as compared to any other subgroup, and each data line group can have a different number of firing cells 70 as compared to any other data line group.<br>
The firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n are electrically coupled to one of the fire lines 110a-110n. In fire group 102a, each of the firing cells 70 is electrically coupled to fire line 110a that receives fire signal or energy signal FIRE1. In fire group 102b, each of the firing cells 70 is electrically coupled to fire line 110b that receives fire signal or energy signal FIRE2 and so on, up to and including fire group 102n wherein each of the firing cells 70 is electrically coupled to fire line 110n that receives fire signal or energy signal FIREn. In addition, each of the firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-<br><br>
102n is electrically coupled to a common reference line 112 that is tied to ground.<br>
In operation, subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL are provided on subgroup enable lines 106a-106L to enable one subgroup of firing cells 70. The enabled firing cells 70 store data signals D1, D2 ... Dm provided on data lines 108a-108m. The data signals D1, D2 ... Dm are stored in memory circuits 74 of enabled firing cells 70. Each of the stored data signals D1, D2 ... Dm sets the state of drive switch 72 in one of the enabled firing cells 70. The drive switch 72 is set to conduct or not conduct based on the stored data signal value.<br>
After the states of the selected drive switches 72 are set, an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided on the fire line 110a-110n corresponding to the fire group 102a-102n that includes the selected subgroup of firing cells 70. The energy signal FIRE1-FIREn includes an energy pulse. The energy pulse is provided on the selected fire line 110a-110n to energize firing resistors 52 in firing cells 70 that have conducting drive switches 72. The energized firing resistors 52 heat and eject ink onto print medium 36 to print an image represented by data signals D1, D2 ... Dm. The process of enabling a subgroup of firing cells 70, storing data signals D1, D2 ... Dm in the enabled subgroup and providing an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn to energize firing resistors 52 in the enabled subgroup continues until printing stops.<br>
In one embodiment, as an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided to a selected fire group 102a-102n, subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL change to select and enable another subgroup in a different fire group 102a-102n. The newly enabled subgroup stores data signals D1, D2 ... Dm provided on data lines 108a-108m and an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided on one of the fire lines 110a-110n to energize firing resistors 52 in the newly enabled firing cells 70. At any one time, only one subgroup of firing cells 70 is enabled by subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL to store data signals D1, D2 ... Dm provided on data lines 108a-108m. In this aspect, data signals D1, D2 ... Dm on data lines 108a-108m are timed division multiplexed data signals. Also, only one subgroup in a selected fire group 102a-102n includes drive switches 72 that are set to conduct while an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided to<br><br>

Figure 6 is a schematic diagram illustrating one embodiment of a pre-charged firing cell 120. Pre-charged firing cell 120 is one embodiment of firing cell 70. The pre-charged firing cell 120 includes a drive switch 172 electrically coupled to a firing resistor 52. In one embodiment, drive switch 172 is a FET including a drain-source path electrically coupled at one end to one terminal of firing resistor 52 and at the other end to a reference line 122. The reference line 122 is tied to a reference voltage, such as ground. The other terminal of firing resistor 52 is electrically coupled to a fire line 124 that receives a fire signal or energy signal FIRE including energy pulses. The energy pulses energize firing resistor 52 if drive switch 172 is on (conducting).<br>
The gate of drive switch 172 forms a storage node capacitance 126 that functions as a memory element to store data pursuant to the sequential activation of a pre-charge transistor 128 and a select transistor 130. The drain-source path and gate of pre-charge transistor 128 are electrically coupled to a pre-charge line 132 that receives a pre-charge signal. The gate of drive switch 172 is electrically coupled to the drain-source path of pre-charge transistor 128 and the drain-source path of select transistor 130. The gate of select transistor 130 is electrically coupled to a select line 134 that receives a select signal. The storage node capacitance 126 is shown in dashed lines, as it is part of drive switch 172. Alternatively, a capacitor separate from drive switch 172 can be used as a memory element.<br>
A data transistor 136, a first address transistor 138 and a second address transistor 140 include drain-source paths that are electrically coupled in parallel. The parallel combination of data transistor 136, first address transistor 138 and second address transistor 140 is electrically coupled between the drain-source path of select transistor 130 and reference line 122. The serial circuit including select transistor 130 coupled to the parallel combination of data transistor 136, first address transistor 138 and second address transistor 140 is electrically coupled across node capacitance 126 of drive switch 172. The gate of data transistor 136 is electrically coupled to data line 142 that receives data signals<br><br>
-DATA. The gate of first address transistor 138 is electrically coupled to an address line 144 that receives address signals -ADDRESS 1 and the gate of second address transistor 140 is electrically coupled to a second address line 146 that receives address signals -ADDRESS2. The data signals -DATA and address signals -ADDRESS1 and -ADDRESS2 are active when low as indicated by the tilda (-) at the beginning of the signal name. The node capacitance 126, pre-charge transistor 128, select transistor 130, data transistor 136 and address transistors 138 and 140 form a memory cell.<br>
In operation, node capacitance 126 is pre-charged through pre-charge transistor 128 by providing a high level voltage pulse on pre-charge line 132. In one embodiment, after the high level voltage pulse on pre-charge line 132, a data signal -DATA is provided on data line 142 to set the state of data transistor 136 and address signals -ADDRESS1 and -ADDRESS2 are provided on address lines 144 and 146 to set the states of first address transistor 138 and second address transistor 140. A voltage pulse of sufficient magnitude is provided on select line 134 to turn on select transistor 130 and node capacitance 126 discharges if data transistor 136, first address transistor 138 and/or second address transistor 140 is on. Alternatively, node capacitance 126 remains charged if data transistor 136, first address transistor 138 and second address transistor 140 are all off.<br>
Pre-charged firing cell 120 is an addressed firing cell if both address signals -ADDRESS1 and -ADDRESS2 are low and node capacitance 126 either discharges if data signal -DATA is high or remains charged if data signal -DATA is low. Pre-charged firing cell 120 is not an addressed firing cell if at least one of the address signals -ADDRESS1 and -ADDRESS2 is high and node capacitance 126 discharges regardless of the data signal -DATA voltage level. The first and second address transistors 136 and 138 comprise an address decoder, and data transistor 136 controls the voltage level on node capacitance 126 if pre-charged firing cell 120 is addressed.<br>
Pre-charged firing cell 120 may utilize any number of other topologies or arrangements, as long as the operational relationships described above are<br><br>
maintained.   For example, an OR gate may be coupled to address lines 144 and 146, the output of which is coupled to a single transistor.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic diagram illustrating one embodiment of an inkjet printhead firing cell array 200. Firing cell array 200 includes a plurality of pre-charged firing cells 120 arranged into six-fire groups 202a-202f. The pre-charged firing cells 120 in each fire group 202a-202f are schematically arranged into 13 rows and eight columns. The fire groups 202a-202f and pre-charged firing cells 120 in array 200 are schematically arranged into 78 rows and eight columns, although the number of pre-charged firing cells and their layout may vary as desired.<br>
The eight columns of pre-charged firing cells 120 are electrically coupled to eight data lines 208a-208h that receive data signals -D1, ~D2 ... ~D8, respectively. Each of the eight columns, referred to herein as a data line group or data group, includes pre-charged firing cells 120 in each of the six fire groups 202a-202f. Each of the firing cells 120 in each column of pre-charged firing cells 120 is electrically coupled to one of the data lines 208a-208h.

The rows of pre-charged firing cells 120 are electrically coupled to address lines 206a-206g that receive address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7, respectively. Each pre-charged firing cell 120 in a row of pre-charged firing cells 120, referred to herein as a row subgroup or subgroup of pre-charged firing cells 120, is electrically coupled to two of the address lines 206a-206g. All pre-<br><br>

The subgroups of the fire groups 202a-202f are identified as subgroups SG1-1 through SG1-13 in fire group one (FG1) 202a, subgroups SG2-1 through SG2-13in fire group two (FG2) 202b and so on, up to and including subgroups SG6-1 through SG6-13 in fire group six (FG6) 202f. In other embodiments, each fire group 202a-202f can include any suitable number of subgroups, such as 14 or more subgroups.<br>
Each subgroup of pre-charged firing cells 120 is electrically coupled to two address lines 206a-206g. The two address lines 206a-206g corresponding to a subgroup are electrically coupled to the first and second address transistors 138 and 140 in all pre-charged firing cells 120 of the subgroup. One address line 206a-206g is electrically coupled to the gate of one of the first and second address transistors 138 and 140 and the other address line 206a-206g is electrically coupled to the gate of the other one of the first and second address transistors 138 and 140. The address lines 206a-206g receive address signals ~A1, ~A2 ...~A7 and are coupled to provide the address signals ~A1, ~A2 ...<br><br><br>
Subgroups of pre-charged firing cells 120 are addressed by providing address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 on address lines 206a-206g. In one embodiment, the address lines 206a-206g are electrically coupled to one or more address generators provided on printhead die 40.<br>
Pre-charge lines 210a-21 Of receive pre-charge signals PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 and provide the pre-charge signals PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 to corresponding fire groups 202a-202f. Pre-charge line 210a is electrically coupled to all of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a. Pre-charge line 210b is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG2 202b and so on, up to and including pre-charge line 21 Of that is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 202f. Each of the pre-charge lines 210a-21 Of is electrically coupled to the gate and drain-source path of all of the pre-charge transistors 128 in the corresponding fire group 202a-202f, and all pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 202a-202f are electrically coupled to only one pre-charge line 210a-210f. Thus, the node capacitances 126 of all pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 202a-202f are charged by providing the corresponding pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 to the corresponding pre-charge line 210a-210f.<br>
Select lines 212a-212f receive select signals SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 and provide the select signals SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 to corresponding fire groups 202a-202f. Select line 212a is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a. Select line 212b is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG2 202b and so on, up to and including select line 212f that is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 202f. Each of the select lines 212a-212f is electrically coupled to the gate of all of the select transistors 130 in the corresponding fire group 202a-202f, and all pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 202a-202f are electrically coupled to only one select line 212a-212f.<br>
Fire lines 214a-214f receive fire signals or energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6 and provide the energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6to corresponding fire groups 202a-202f. Fire line 214a is electrically coupled to all<br><br>
pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a. Fire line 214b is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG2 202b and so on, up to and including fire line 214f that is electrically coupled to all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 2021 Each of the fire lines 214a-214f is electrically coupled to all of the firing resistors 52 in the corresponding fire group 202a-202f, and all pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 202a-202f are electrically coupled to only one fire line 214a-214f. The fire lines 214a-214f are electrically coupled to external supply circuitry by appropriate interface pads. (See, Figures 25A and 25B). All pre-charged firing cells 120 in array 200 are electrically coupled to a reference line 216 that is tied to a reference voltage, such as ground. Thus, the pre-charged firing cells 120 in a row subgroup of pre-charged firing cells 120 are electrically coupled to the same address lines 206a-206g, pre-charge line 210a-210f, select line 212a-212f and fire line 214a-214f.<br>
In operation, in one embodiment fire groups 202a-202f are selected to fire in succession. FG1 202a is selected before FG2 202b, which is selected before FG3 and so on, up to FG6 202f. After FG6 202f, the fire group cycle starts over with FG1 202a.   However, other sequences, and non-sequential selections may be utilized.<br>
The address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 cycle through the 13 row subgroup addresses before repeating a row subgroup address. The address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 provided on address lines 206a-206g are set to one row subgroup address during each cycle through the fire groups 202a-202f. The address signals ~A1 ~A2 ... ~A7 select one row subgroup in each of the fire groups 202a-202f for one cycle through the fire groups 202a-202f. For the next cycle through fire groups 202a-202f, the address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 are changed to select another row subgroup in each of the fire groups 202a-202f. This continues up to the address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 selecting the last row subgroup in fire groups 202a-202f. After the last row subgroup, address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 select the first row subgroup to begin the address cycle over again.<br>
In another aspect of operation, one of the fire groups 202a-202f is operated by providing a pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 on the pre-<br><br>
charge line 210a-210f of the one fire group 202a-202f. The pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 defines a pre-charge time interval or period during which time the node capacitance 126 on each drive switch 172 in the one fire group 202a-202f is charged to a high voltage level, to pre-charge the one fire group 202a-202f.<br>
Address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 are provided on address lines 206a-206g to address one row subgroup in each of the fire groups 202a-202f, including one row subgroup in the pre-charged fire group 202a-202f. Data signals ~D1, ~D2 ... ~D8 are provided on data lines 208a-208h to provide data to ail fire groups 202a-202f, including the addressed row subgroup in the pre-charged fire group 202a-202f.<br>
Next, a select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 is provided on the select line 212a-212f of the pre-charged fire group 202a-202f to select the pre-charged fire group 202a-202f. The select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 defines a discharge time interval for discharging the node capacitance 126 on each drive switch 172 in a pre-charged firing cell 120 that is either not in the addressed row subgroup in the selected fire group 202a-202f or addressed in the selected fire group 202a-202f and receiving a high level data signal ~D1, ~D2 ... ~D8. The node capacitance 126 does not discharge in pre-charged firing cells 120 that are addressed in the selected fire group 202a-202f and receiving a low level data signal ~D1, ~D2 ... ~D8. A high voltage level on the node capacitance 126 turns the drive switch 172 on (conducting).<br>
After drive switches 172 in the selected fire group 202a-202f are set to conduct or not conduct, an energy pulse or voltage pulse is provided on the fire line 214a-214f of the selected fire group 202a-202f. Pre-charged firing cells 120 that have conducting drive switches 172, conduct current through the firing resistor 52 to heat ink and eject ink from the corresponding drop generator 60.<br>
With fire groups 202a-202f operated in succession, the select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 for one fire group 202a-202f is used as the pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 for the next fire group 202a-202f. The pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 for one fire group 202a-202f precedes the select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 and energy signal FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6forthe<br><br>
one fire group 202a-202f. After the pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6, data signals ~D1, ~D2 ... ~D8 are multiplexed in time and stored in the addressed row subgroup of the one fire group 202a-202f by the select signal SEL1.SEL2... SEL6. The select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 for the selected fire group 202a-202f is also the pre-charge signal PRE1, PRE2 ... PRE6 for the next fire group 202a-202f. After the select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 for the selected fire group 202a-202f is complete, the select signal SEL1, SEL2 ... SEL6 for the next fire group 202a-202f is provided. Pre-charged firing cells 120 in the selected subgroup fire or heat ink based on the stored data signal ~D1, HD2 ... ~D8 as the energy signal FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6, including an energy pulse, is provided to the selected fire group 202a-202f.<br>
Figure 8 is a timing diagram illustrating the operation of one embodiment of firing cell array 200. Fire groups 202a-202f are selected in succession to energize pre-charged firing cells 120 based on data signals ~D1, ~D2 ... ~D8, indicated at 300. The data signals ~D1, ~D2 ... ~D8 at 300 are changed depending on the nozzles that are to eject fluid, indicated at 302, for each row subgroup address and fire group 202a-202f combination. Address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 at 304 are provided on address lines 206a-206g to address one row subgroup from each of the fire groups 202a-202f. The address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 at 304 are set to one address, indicated at 306, for one cycle through fire groups 202a-202f. After the cycle is complete, the address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 at 304 are changed at 308 to address a different row subgroup from each of the fire groups 202a-202f. The address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 at 304 increment through the row subgroups to address the row subgroups in sequential order from one to 13 and back to one. In other embodiments, address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 at 304 can be set to address row subgroups in any suitable order.<br>
During a cycle through fire groups 202a-202f, select line 212f coupled to FG6 202f and pre-charge line 210a coupled to FG1 202a receive SEL6/PRE1 signal 309, including SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse 310. In one embodiment, the select line 212f and pre-charge line 210a are electrically coupled together to receive the same signal. In another embodiment, the select line 212f and pre-<br><br>
charge line 210a are not electrically coupled together, but receive similar signals.<br>
The SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse at 310 on pre-charge line 210a, pre-charges all firing cells 120 in FG1 202a. The node capacitance 126 for each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a is charged to a high voltage level. The node capacitances 126 for pre-charged firing cells 120 in one row subgroup SG1-K, indicated at 311, are pre-charged to a high voltage level at 312. The row subgroup address at 306 selects subgroup SG1-K, and a data signal set at 314 is provided to data transistors 136 in all pre-charged firing cells 120 of all fire groups 202a-202f, including the address selected row subgroup SG1-K.<br>
The select line 212a for FG1 202a and pre-charge line 210b for FG2 202b receive the SEL1/PRE2 signal 315, including the SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 316. The SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 316 on select line 212a turns on the select transistor 130 in each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a. The node capacitance 126 is discharged in all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a that are not in the address selected row subgroup SG1-K. In the address selected row subgroup SG1-K, data at 314 are stored, indicated at 318, in the node capacitances 126 of the drive switches 172 in row subgroup SG1-K to either turn the drive switch on (conducting) or off (non-conducting).<br>
The SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse at 316 on pre-charge line 210b, pre-charges all firing cells 120 in FG2 202b.

The row subgroup address at 306 selects subgroup SG2-K, and a data signal set at 328 is provided to data transistors 136 in all pre-charged firing cells 120 of all fire groups 202a-202f, including the address selected row subgroup SG2-K.<br>
The fire line 214a receives energy signal FIRE1, indicated at 323, including an energy pulse at 322 to energize firing resistors 52 in pre-charged firing cells 120 that have conductive drive switches 172 in FG1 202a. The FIRE1 energy pulse 322 goes high while the SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 316 is high and while the node capacitance 126 on non-conducting drive switches 172<br><br>
are being actively pulled low, indicated on energy signal FIRE1 323 at 324. Switching the energy pulse 322 high while the node capacitances 126 are actively pulled low, prevents the node capacitances 126 from being inadvertently charged through the drive switch 172 as the energy pulse 322 goes high. The SEL1/PRE2 signal 315 goes low and the energy pulse 322 is provided to FG1 202a for a predetermined time to heat ink and eject the ink through nozzles 34 corresponding to the conducting pre-charged firing cells 120.<br>
The select line 212b for FG2 202b and pre-charge line 210c for FG3 202c receive SEL2/PRE3 signal 325, including SEL2/PRE3 signal pulse 326. After the SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 316 goes low and while the energy pulse 322 is high, the SEL2/PRE3 signal pulse 326 on select line 212b turns on select transistor 130 in each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG2 202b. The node capacitance 126 is discharged on all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG2 202b that are not in the address selected row subgroup SG2-K. Data signal set 328 for subgroup SG2-K is stored in the pre-charged firing cells 120 of subgroup SG2-K, indicated at 330, to either turn the drive switches 172 on (conducting) or off (non-conducting). The SEL2/PRE3 signal pulse on pre-charge line 210c pre-charges all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG3 202c.<br>
Fire line 214b receives energy signal FIRE2, indicated at 331, including energy pulse 332, to energize firing resistors 52 in pre-charged firing cells 120 of FG2 202b that have conducting drive switches 172. The FIRE2 energy pulse 332 goes high while the SEL2/PRE3 signal pulse 326 is high, indicated at 334. The SEL2/PRE3 signal pulse 326 goes low and the FIRE2 energy pulse 332 remains high to heat and eject ink from the corresponding drop generator 60.<br>
After the SEL2/PRE3 signal pulse 326 goes low and while the energy pulse 332 is high, a SEL3/PRE4 signal is provided to select FG3 202c and pre-charge FG4 202d. The process of pre-charging, selecting and providing an energy signal, including an energy pulse, continues up to and including FG6 202f.<br>
The SEL5/PRE6 signal pulse on pre-charge line 21 Of, pre-charges all firing cells 120 in FG6 202f. The node capacitance 126 for each of the pre-<br><br>
charged firing cells 120 in FG6 202f is charged to a high voltage level. The node capacitances 126 for pre-charged firing cells 120 in one row subgroup SG6-K, indicated at 339, are pre-charged to a high voltage level at 341. The row subgroup address at 306 selects subgroup SG6-K, and data signal set 338 is provided to data transistors 136 in all pre-charged firing cells 120 of all fire groups 202a-202f, including the address selected row subgroup SG6-K.<br>
The select line 212f for FG6 202f and pre-charge line 210a for FG1 202a receive a second SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse at 336. The second SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse 336 on select line 212f turns on the select transistor 130 in each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 202f. The node capacitance 126 is discharged in all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 202f that are not in the address selected row subgroup SG6-K. In the address selected row subgroup SG6-K, data 338 are stored at 340 in the node capacitances 126 of each drive switch 172 to either turn the drive switch on or off.<br>
The SEL6/PRE1 signal on pre-charge line 210a, pre-charges node capacitances 126 in all firing cells 120 in FG1 202a, including firing cells 120 in row subgroup SG1-K, indicated at 342, to a high voltage level. The firing cells 120 in FG1 202a are pre-charged while the address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 304 select row subgroups SG1-K, SG2-K and on, up to row subgroup SG6-K.<br>
The fire line 214f receives energy signal FIRE6, indicated at 343, including an energy pulse at 344 to energize fire resistors 52 in pre-charged firing cells 120 that have conductive drive switches 172 in FG6 202f. The energy pulse 344 goes high while the SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse 336 is high and node capacitances 126 on non-conducting drive switches 172 are being actively pulled low, indicated at 346. Switching the energy pulse 344 high while the node capacitances 126 are actively pulled low, prevents the node capacitances 126 from being inadvertently charged through drive switch 172 as the energy pulse 344 goes high. The SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse 336 goes low and the energy pulse 344 is maintained high for a predetermined time to heat ink and eject ink through nozzles 34 corresponding to the conducting pre-charged firing cells 120.<br><br>
After the SEL6/PRE1 signal pulse 336 goes low and while the energy pulse 344 is high, address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 304 are changed at 308 to select another set of subgroups SG1-K+1, SG2-K+1 and so on, up to SG6-K+1. The select line 212a for FG1 202a and pre-charge line 210b for FG2 202b receive a SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse, indicated at 348. The SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 348 on select line 212a turns on the select transistor 130 in each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a. The node capacitance 126 is discharged in all pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 202a that are not in the address selected subgroup SG1-K+1. Data signal set 350 for row subgroup SG1-K+1 is stored in the pre-charged firing cells 120 of subgroup SG1-K+1 to either turn drive switches 172 on or off. The SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 348 on pre-charge line 210b pre-charges all firing cells 120 in FG2 202b.<br>
The fire line 214a receives energy pulse 352 to energize firing resistors 52 and pre-charged firing cells 120 of FG1 202a that have conducting drive switches 172. The energy pulse 352 goes high while the SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse at 348 is high. The SEL1/PRE2 signal pulse 348 goes low and the energy pulse 352 remains high to heat and eject ink from corresponding drop generators 60. The process continues until printing is complete.<br>

The timing pulse in fourth pre-charge signal PRE4 charges a first one of the direction lines 408 to a high voltage level. The direction circuit 404 receives a reduced voltage level timing pulse from timing signal T4 in fourth evaluation signal EVAL4. If direction circuit 404 receives a control pulse in control signal CSYNC coincident with (at the same time as) the fourth evaluation signal EVAL4, direction circuit 404 discharges the first direction line 408.

forward direction. If the first direction line 408 remains at a high voltage level and the second direction line 408 is discharged to a low voltage level, the signal levels on direction lines 408 set up shift register 402 to shift in the reverse direction. If both the first and second direction lines 408 are discharged to low voltage levels, shift register 402 is prevented from providing a high voltage level shift register output signal S01-S013.

If the internal node in a shift register cell 403 is at a low voltage level, such as after receiving the control pulse from control signal CSYNC coincident with the timing pulse in first evaluation signal EVAL1, shift register 402 maintains the shift register output signal S01-S013 at the high voltage level. If the internal node in a shift register cell 403 is at a high voltage level, such as in all other shift register cells 403, shift register 402 discharges<br><br>
the shift register output line 410a-410m to provide low voltage level shift register output signals S01-S013. The shift register 402 is initiated in one series of the six timing pulses. The shift register output signals S01-S013 become valid during the timing pulse from timing signal T4 in second evaluation signal EVAL2 and remain valid until the timing pulse from timing signal T3 in the next series of six timing pulses.

If shift register 402 is initiated, one shift register output signal S01-S013 remains at a high voltage level after the timing pulse from timing signal T4. Logic array 406 receives the timing pulse from timing signal T5 to charge evaluation signal line 474 and turn on address evaluation transistor 440.

provide high voltage level address signals ~A1, ~A2, ... ~A7. The high voltage level address signals ~A1, ~A2,... ~A7 prevent firing cells 120 and firing cell subgroups from being enabled for activation.<br>

Shift register 402 receives a control pulse in control signal CSYNC and provides a single high voltage level output signal. As described above and described in detail below, the shifting direction of shift register 402 is set in response to direction signals DIRF and DIRR, which are generated during timing pulses in timing signals T3-T6 based on the control signal CSYNC on control signal line 430. If shift register 402 is shifting in the forward direction, shift register 402 sets shift register output line 410a and shift register output signal S01 to a high voltage level in response to the control pulse and timing pulses on timing signals T1-T4. If shift register 402 is shifting in the reverse direction, shift register 402 sets shift register output line 410m and shift register output signal S013 to a high voltage level in response to the control pulse and<br><br>
timing pulses in timing signal T1-T4. The high voltage level output signal S01 or S013 is shifted through shift register 402 from one shift register cell 403 to the next shift register cell 403 in response to timing pulses in timing signals T1-T4.<br>
The shift register 402 shifts in the control pulse and shifts the single high level output signal from one shift register cell 403 to the next shift register cell 403 using two pre-charge operations and two evaluate operations. The first stage 500 of each shift register cell 403 receives forward direction signal DIRF and reverse direction signal DIRR. Also, the first stage 500 of each shift register 403 receives a forward shift register input signal SIF and a reverse shift register input signal SIR. All shift register cells 403 in shift register 402 are set to shift in the same direction and at the same time as timing pulses are received in timing signals T1-T4.<br>
The first stage 500 of each shift register cell 403 shifts in either the forward shift register input signal SIF or the reverse shift register input signal SIR. The high or low voltage level of the selected shift register input signal SIF or SIR is provided as the shift register output signal S01-S013. The first stage 500 of each shift register cell 403 pre-charges internal node 522 during a timing pulse from timing signal T1 and evaluates the selected shift register input signal SIF or SIR during a timing pulse from timing signal T2. The second stage 502 in each shift register cell 403 pre-charges shift register output lines 410a-410m during a timing pulse from timing signal T3 and evaluates the internal node signal SN (e.g., SN1) during a timing pulse from timing signal T4.<br>
The direction signals DIRF and DIRR set the forward/reverse direction of shifting in shift register cell 403a and all other shift register cells 403 in shift register 402. Shift register 402 shifts in the forward direction if forward direction signal DIRF is at a high voltage level and reverse direction signal DIRR is at a low voltage level. Shift register 402 shifts in the reverse direction if reverse direction signal DIRR is at a high voltage level and forward direction signal DIRF is at a low voltage level. If both direction signals DIRF and DIRR are at low voltage levels, shift register 402 does not shift in either direction and all shift register output signals S01-S013 are cleared to inactive low voltage levels.<br><br>
In operation of shifting shift register cell 403a in the forward direction, fon/vard direction signal DIRF is set to a high voltage level and reverse direction signal DIRR is set to a low voltage level. The high voltage level forward direction signal DIRF turns on forward direction transistor 512 and the low voltage level reverse direction signal DIRR turns off reverse direction transistor 514. A timing pulse from timing signal T1 is provided to shift register 402 in first pre-charge signal PRE1 to charge internal node 522 to a high voltage level through first pre-charge transistor 504. Next, a timing pulse from timing signal T2 is provided to resistor divide network 412 and a reduced voltage level T2 timing pulse is provided to shift register 402 in first evaluation signal EVAL1. The timing pulse in first evaluation signal EVAL1 turns on first evaluation transistor 506. If the forward shift register input signal SIF is at a high voltage level, forward input transistor 508 is turned on and with forward direction transistor 512 already turned on, internal node 522 is discharged to provide a low voltage level internal node signal SN1. The internal node 522 is discharged through first evaluation transistor 506, forward input transistor 508 and forward direction transistor 512. If the forward shift register input signal SIF is at a low voltage level, forward input transistor 508 is turned off and internal node 522 remains charged to provide a high voltage level internal node signal SN1. Reverse shift register input signal SIR controls reverse input transistor 510. However, reverse direction transistor 514 is turned off such that internal node 522 cannot be discharged through reverse input transistor 510.<br>
The internal node signal SN1 on internal node 522 controls internal node transistor 520. A low voltage level internal node signal SN1 turns off internal node transistor 520 and a high voltage level internal node signal SN1 turns on internal node transistor 520.<br>
A timing pulse from timing signal T3 is provided to shift register 402 as second pre-charge signal PRE2. The timing pulse in second pre-charge signal PRE2 charges shift register output line 410a to a high voltage level through second pre-charge transistor 516. Next, a timing pulse from timing signal T4 is provided to a resistor divide network 414 and a reduced voltage level T4 timing pulse is provided to shift register 402 as second evaluation signal EVAL2. The<br><br>
timing pulse in second evaluation signal EVAL2 turns on second evaluation transistor 518. If internal node transistor 520 is off, shift register output line 410a remains charged to a high voltage level. If internal node transistor 520 is on, shift register output line 410a is discharged to a low voltage level. The shift register output signal S01 is the high/low inverse of the internal node signal SN1, which was the high/low inverse of the forward shift register input signal SIF. The level of the forward shift register input signal SIF was shifted to the shift register output signal SOL<br>
In shift register cell 403a, the forward shift register input signal SIF is control signal CSYNC on control line 430. To discharge internal node 522 to a low voltage level, a control pulse in control signal CSYNC is provided at the same time as a timing pulse in first evaluation signal EVAL1. The control pulse in control signal CSYNC that is coincident with the timing pulse from timing signal T2 initiates shift register 402 for shifting in the forward direction.<br>
In operation of shifting shift register cell 403a in the reverse direction, forward direction signal DIRF is set to a low voltage level and reverse direction signal DIRR is set to a high voltage level. The low voltage level forward direction signal DIRF turns off forward direction transistor 512 and the high voltage level reverse direction signal DIRR turns on reverse direction transistor 514. A timing pulse from timing signal T1 is provided in first pre-charge signal PRE1 to charge internal node 522 to a high voltage level through first pre-charge transistor 504. Next, a timing pulse from timing signal T2 is provided to resistor divide network 412 and a reduced voltage level T2 timing pulse is provided in first evaluation signal EVAL1.

Figure 16 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a latch register 1220. The latch circuit 1202 includes seven latch registers, such as latch register 1220. Each latch register 1220 latches in one of the seven address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 and provides the corresponding latched address signals -B1, ~B2, ...~B7. The latch register 1220 includes a first latch stage 1222, a second latch stage 1224 and a latch transistor 1226. The first latch stage 1222 is electrically coupled at 1228 to one side of the drain-source path of latch transistor 1226 and the second latch stage 1224 is electrically coupled at 1230 to the other side of the drain-source path of latch transistor 1226. The gate of latch transistor 1226 is electrically coupled to signal line 1208a that conducts select signal SEL1 to latch transistor 1226 as latch signal LATCH.<br><br>
The first latch stage 1222 includes a first pre-charge transistor 1234, a select transistor 1236, an address transistor 1238 and an address node capacitor 1240. The gate of the first pre-charge transistor 1234 is electrically coupled to the drain of first pre-charge transistor 1234 and to a signal line 1208f that conducts select signal SEL6 to first pre-charge transistor 1234 as first pre-charge signal PRE1. The source of first pre-charge transistor 1234 is electrically coupled at 1228 to one side of the drain-source path of latch transistor 1226 and to one side of address node capacitor 1240. The other side of address node capacitor 1240 is electrically coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground. In addition, the source of first pre-charge transistor 1234 is electrically coupled to one side of the drain-source path of select transistor 1236. The gate of select transistor 1236 is electrically coupled to select line 1208a that conducts select signal SEL1 to select transistor 1236. The other side of the drain-source path of select transistor 1236 is electrically coupled to one side of the drain-source path of address transistor 1238. The other side of the drain-source path of address transistor 1238 is electrically coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground. The gate of address transistor 1238 is electrically coupled to one of the address lines 1206.<br>
The second latch stage 1224 includes a second pre-charge transistor 1246, an evaluation transistor 1248, a latched address transistor 1250 and a latched address node capacitor 1252. The gate of the second pre-charge transistor 1246 is electrically coupled to the drain of second pre-charge transistor 1246 and to signal line 1208a that conducts select signal SEL1 to the second pre-charge transistor 1246 as second pre-charge signal PRE2. The source of second pre-charge transistor 1246 is electrically coupled to one side of the drain-source path of evaluation transistor 1248 and to one of the latched address lines 1212. The gate of evaluation transistor 1248 is electrically coupled to evaluation signal line 1214. The other side of the drain-source path of evaluation transistor 1248 is electrically coupled to the drain-source path of latched address transistor 1250. The other side of the drain-source path of latched address transistor 1250 is electrically coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground. The gate of latched address transistor 1250 is electrically<br><br>
coupled at 1230 to the drain-source path of latch transistor 1226. In addition, the gate of latched address transistor 1250 is electrically coupled at 1230 to one side of latched address node capacitor 1252. The other side of latched address node capacitor 1252 is electrically coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground.<br>
The first pre-charge transistor 1234 receives pre-charge signal PRE1 through signal line 1208f, and select transistor 1236 receives select signal SEL1 through signal line 1208a. If select signal SEL1 is set to a low voltage level and pre-charge signal PRE1 is set to a high voltage level, select transistor 1236 is turned off (non-conducting) and address node capacitor 1240 charges to a high voltage level through pre-charge transistor 1234.<br>
The address transistor 1238 receives one of the address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 through address line 1206. If the received address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 is set to a high voltage level, address transistor 1238 is turned on (conducting) and if the received address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 is set to a low voltage level, address transistor 1238 is turned off (non-conducting). Select transistor 1236 is turned on as select signal SEL1 transitions to a high voltage level. If address transistor 1238 is on, address node capacitor 1240 is discharged to a low voltage level. If address transistor 1238 is off and address node capacitor 1240 is charged to a high voltage level, address node capacitor 1240 is not discharged and remains at the high voltage level.<br>
The latch transistor 1226 receives latch signal LATCH through signal line 1208a. If latch signal LATCH is set to a high voltage level, latch transistor 1226 is turned on and if latch signal LATCH is set to a low voltage level, latch transistor 1226 is turned off. The latch transistor 1226 is turned on to pass the voltage level on address node capacitor 1240 to latched address node capacitor 1252. The capacitance of the address node capacitor 1240 is about three times larger than the capacitance of the latched address node capacitor 1252 such that when charge is moved between address node capacitor 1240 and latched address node capacitor 1252, adequate high or low voltage levels remain on capacitors 1240 and 1252.<br><br>
If latch transistor 1226 is off as address node capacitor 1240 charges to a high voltage level through first pre-charge transistor 1234, the voltage level on latched address node capacitor 1252 remains unchanged. The address node capacitor 1240 is pre-charged without affecting the second latch stage 1224 of latch register 1220, including the latched address signal on latched address line 1212. If the latch transistor 1226 is on as address node capacitor 1240 charges to a high voltage level through first pre-charge transistor 1234, latched address node capacitor 1252 is charged to a high voltage level and latched address transistor 1250 is turned on. The second latch stage 1224, including the latched address signal on latched address line 1212, is affected as the address node capacitor 1240 and latched address node capacitor 1252 are charged to a high voltage level through first pre-charge transistor 1234. In one embodiment, latch transistor 1226 is removed from between first latch stage 1222 and second latch stage 1224. In addition, latched address node capacitor 1252 can be removed and the capacitance value of address node capacitor 1240 can be reduced as the address node capacitor 1240 no longer needs to charge or discharge latched address node capacitor 1252. In this embodiment, address node capacitor 1240 is pre-charged through first pre-charge transistor 1234 to turn on latched address transistor 1250 in the second latch stage 1224 and pre-charging of address node capacitor 1240 is not isolated from second latch stage 1224.<br>
The second pre-charge transistor 1246 receives pre-charge signal PRE2 through signal line 1208a, and evaluation transistor 1248 receives an evaluation signal EVAL through evaluation signal line 1246. If evaluation signal EVAL is set to a low voltage level and pre-charge signal PRE2 is set to a high voltage level, evaluation transistor 1248 is turned off and latched address line 1212 charges to a high voltage level through pre-charge transistor 1246.<br>
The latch transistor 1226 is turned on to pass the voltage level on address node capacitor 1240 to latched address node capacitor 1252. A high voltage level turns on latched address transistor 1250 and a low voltage level turns off latched address transistor 1250. The evaluation signal EVAL is set to a high voltage level to turn on evaluation transistor 1248 and discharge the<br><br>
latched address signal to a low voltage level if latched address transistor 1250 is turned on. If the latched address transistor 1250 is off as evaluation transistor 1248 is turned on, the latched address line 1212 remains at a high voltage level. The latch transistor 1226 is turned off to latch in the voltage level on latched address node capacitor 1252 and the state of latched address transistor 1250.<br>
In an example operation of one embodiment of latch register 1220, first pre-charge signal PRE1, select signal SEL1 and latch signal LATCH are set to a low voltage level. In addition, second pre-charge signal PRE2 is set to a low voltage level and evaluation signal EVAL is set to a high voltage level. With latch signal LATCH at a low voltage level, latch transistor 1226 is turned off to latch in the voltage level on latched address node capacitor 1252 that sets the on/off state of latched address transistor 1250. With evaluation signal EVAL set to a high voltage level, evaluation transistor 1248 is turned on to discharge the latched address signal if latched address transistor 1250 is turned on. With pre-charge signal PRE2 set to a low voltage level, the voltage level on latched address line 1212 corresponds to the state of latched address transistor 1250. If latched address transistor 1250 is on, latched address signal ~B1, ~B2, ... ~B7 on latched address line 1212 is actively driven to a low voltage level. If latched address transistor 1250 is off, latched address signal ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7 on latched address line 1212 remains at a pre-charged high voltage level.<br>
The first pre-charge signal PRE1 is set to a high voltage level to pre-charge address node capacitor 1240 to a high voltage level. As address node capacitor 1240 is charged to a high voltage level, a valid address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 is provided on address line 1206 to address transistor 1238. The valid address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 sets the on/off state of address transistor 1238 and pre-charge signal PRE1 transitions to a low voltage level at the end of the first pre-charge time period.<br>
Next, select signal SEL1, latch signal LATCH and pre-charge signal PRE2 are set to a high voltage level and evaluation signal EVAL is set to a low voltage level. The select signal SEL1 turns on select transistor 1236 and latch signal LATCH turns on latch transistor 1226. If the valid address signal -A1, ~A2, ...~A7 on signal line 1206 is at a high voltage level, address transistor<br><br>
1238 is turned on and address node capacitor 1240 and latched address node capacitor 1252 are discharged to a low voltage level. If the valid address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 on signal line 1206 is at a low voltage level, address transistor 1238 is turned off and address node capacitor 1240 charges latched address node capacitor 1252 to a high voltage level. The inverse of the valid address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 received on signal line 1206 is stored on capacitors 1240 and 1252.<br>
The voltage level on latched address capacitor 1252 sets the on/off state of latched address transistor 1250. With evaluation signal EVAL set to a low voltage level and pre-charge signal PRE2 set to a high voltage level, evaluation transistor 1248 is turned off and latch address line 1212 is charged to a high voltage level. The select signal SEL1, latch signal LATCH and pre-charge signal PRE2 are set to a low voltage level at the end of the select time period. With latch signal LATCH at a low voltage level, latch transistor 1226 is turned off to latch in the state of latched address transistor 1250.<br>
Next, evaluation signal EVAL is set to a high voltage level to turn on evaluation transistor 1248. If the latched address node capacitor 1252 is charged to a high voltage level to turn on latch address transistor 1250, the latched address line 1212 is discharged to a low voltage level. If the latched address node capacitor 1252 is at a low voltage level to turn off latched address transistor 1250, latched address line 1212 remains charged to a high voltage level. Thus, the inverse of the address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 is present on the latched address node capacitor 1252 and the inverse of the voltage level on the latched address node capacitor 1252 is present on the latched address line 1212 as latched address signal ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7. The address signal ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 is latched into latch register 1220 and provided as latched address signal ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7 on latched address line 1212. The latched address signal ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7 remains valid as pre-charge signal PRE1 is toggled high to charge address node capacitor 1240 with latch transistor 1226 turned off. The latched address signal ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7 becomes invalid as select signal SEL1, latch signal LATCH and pre-charge signal PRE2 are set to a high voltage level and evaluation signal EVAL is set to a low voltage level.<br><br>
Figure 17 is a timing diagram illustrating an example operation of one embodiment of latch register 1220. Address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 at 1300 are in transition at 1302. Pre-charge signal PRE1 at 1304 is set to a high voltage level at 1306 for one time period, indicated at 1308. During time period 1308, select signal SEL1 at 1310 and latch signal LATCH at 1312 are set to a low voltage level to turn off select transistor 1236 and latch transistor 1226, respectively. The high voltage level of pre-charge signal PRE1 at 1306, charges address node capacitor 1240 through pre-charge transistor 1234.

Drop generators 60 between ink feed slot 1704 and one side 1700a of printhead die 1700 are in data line groups D1 at 1710a and 1710d, D3 at 1714a and 1714d, D5 at 1718a and 1718d and D7 at 1722a and 1722d. Drop generators 60 between ink feed slot 1708 and the other side 1700b of printhead die 1700 are in data line groups D2 at 1712c and 1712f, D4 at 1716c and 1716f, D6 at 1720c and 1720f and D8 at 1724c and 1724f. Thus, four data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g are routed between ink feed slot 1704 and one side 1700a of printhead die 1700, as opposed to routing all eight data lines 208a-208h. Also, four data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are routed between ink feed slot 1708 and the other side 1700b of printhead die 1700, as opposed to routing all eight data lines 208a-208h.<br>
In addition, drop generators 60 between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 are in data line groups D2 at 1712a, 1712b, 1712d and 1712e, D4 at 1716a, 1716b, i     1716d and 1716e, D6 at 1720a, 1720b, 1720d and 1720e, and D8 at 1724a, 1724b, 1724d and 1724e.

Thus, four data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 and four data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g are routed between ink feed slots 1706 and 1708, as opposed to routing all eight data lines 208a-208h between the ink feed slots 1704 and 1706, and ink feed slots 1706 and 1708. The size of printhead die 1700 is reduced by routing four data lines instead of eight data lines 208a-208h.<br>
In one embodiment, printhead die 1700 includes 600 drop generators 60. Each of the six fire groups 1702a-1702f includes 100 drop generators 60.

Further, the printhead die may include a fewer or greater number of fluid feed sources<br>
Figure 22 is a diagram illustrating another aspect of the example layout of one embodiment of printhead die 1700. The printhead die 1700 includes data lines 208a-208h, fire lines 214a-214f, ink feed sources, e.g. ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708 and the six fire groups 1702a-1702f. In addition, printhead die 1700 includes address generators 1800a and 1800b and two sets of address lines 1806a-1806g and 1808a-1808g. Address generator 1800a is electrically coupled to address lines 1806a-1806g, and address generator 1800b is electrically coupled to address lines 1808a-1808g. Address lines 1806a-1806g are electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in row subgroups in fire groups 1702a-1702c, and address lines 1808a-1808g are electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in row subgroups in fire groups 1702d-1702f. The address lines 1806a-1806g and 1808a-1808g are electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in row subgroups as previously described for address lines 206a-206g, respectively.<br><br>
The address generators 1800a and 1800b are similar to address generators 1000 and 1002 illustrated in Figure 13. Accordingly, suitable embodiments of address generators 1800a and 1800b can be implemented as illustrated in Figures 9-12.<br>
The address generators 1800a and 1800b supply address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... -A7 and ~B1, -B2 ... ~B7 to fire groups 1702a-1702f through address lines 1806a-1806g and 1808a-1808g. Address generator 1800a supplies address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 to fire groups 1702a-1702c through address lines 1806a-1806g. Address generator 1800b supplies address signals ~B1, ~B2 ... -B7 to fire groups 1702d-1702f through address lines 1808a-1808g. The address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 are supplied by address generator 1800a to fire groups 1702a-1702c as the select signals SEL1, SEL2 and SEL3 are provided on select lines 212a-212c. The address signals ~B1, ~B2 ... ~B7 are supplied by address generator 1800b to fire groups 1702d-1702f as the select signals SEL4, SEL5 and SEL6 are provided on select lines 212d-212f. In one cycle through fire groups 1702a-1702f, address generator 1800a supplies address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 to half the fire groups 1702a-1702c and address generator 1800b supplies address signals ~B1, ~B2 ... ~B7 to the other half of the fire groups 1702d-1702f. In one embodiment, the address generators 1800a and 1800b are synchronized to provide the same address on address lines 1806a-1806g and 1808a-1808g during one cycle through fire groups 1702a-1702f. After each cycle through fire groups 1702a-1702f, the address generators 1800a and 1800b change address signals ~A1, ~A2 ... ~A7 and ~B1, ~B2 ... ~B7 to address the next sequential row subgroup in the sequence of thirteen row subgroups.<br>
The address generators 1800a and 1800b are located in opposite corners of printhead die 1700. Address generator 1800a is located in the corner bounded by printhead die sides 1700b and 1700c. Address generator 1800b is located in the corner bounded by printhead die sides 1700a and 1700d.<br>
The seven address lines 1806a-1806g are routed between ink feed slot 1708 and printhead die side 1700b, and along printhead die side 1700c to between ink feed slot 1704 and printhead die side 1700a. In addition, address<br><br>
ines 1806a-1806g are routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706, and between ink feed slots 1706 and 1708. The address lines 1806a-1806g are outed along one half of the length of ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708 to electrically couple with pre-charged firing cells 120 in fire groups 1702a-1702c. The layout of address generators 1800a and 1800b may vary, and may be jtilized to increase the frequency of operation by reducing the length of the signal paths to the pre-charged firing cells 120.<br>
The seven address lines 1808a-1808g are routed between ink feed slot 1704 and printhead die side 1700a, and along printhead die side 1700d to between ink feed slot 1708 and printhead die side 1700b. In addition, address ines 1808a-1808g are routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706, and Detween ink feed slots 1706 and 1708.

Data line 208a is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D1 at 1710 to provide data signal ~D1. Data line 208c is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D3 at 1714 to provide data signal ~D3. Data line 208e is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D5 at 1718 to provide data signal ~D5, and data line 208g is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D7 at 1722 to provide data signal ~D7. The data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g receive data signals ~D1, ~D3, ~D5 and ~D7 and provide the data signals ~D1, ~D3, ~D5 and ~D7 to pre-charged firing cells 120 in each of the fire groups 1702a-1702f. In one<br><br>
embodiment, data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g are not routed the entire length of ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708. Instead, each of the data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g is routed to its respective data line group from a bond pad located along the side of printhead die 1700 nearest the data line group in the fire groups 1702a-1702f. Data lines 208a and 208c are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1700c of printhead die 1700, and data lines 208e and 208f are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1700d of printhead die 1700.<br>
Data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 and between ink feed slot 1708 and printhead die side 1700b. Each of the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h that are routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in four fire groups 1702a, 1702b, 1702d and 1702e. Each of the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h that are routed between ink feed slot 1708 and printhead die side 1700b is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in two fire groups 1702c and 1702f. Data line 208b is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D2 at 1712 to provide data signal ~D2. Data line 208d is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D4 at 1716 to provide data signal ~D4. Data line 208f is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D6 at 1720 to provide data signal ~D6, and data line 208h is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in data line group D8 at 1724 to provide data signal ~D8. The data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h receive data signals ~D2, ~D4, -D6 and ~D8 and provide the data signals ~D2, ~D4, ~D6 and ~D8 to pre-charged firing cells 120 in each of the fire groups 1702a-1702f. In one embodiment, the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are not routed the entire length of ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708. Instead, each of the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h is routed to its respective data line group from a bond pad located along the side of printhead die 1700 nearest the data line group in fire groups 1702a-1702f. Data line 208b and 208d are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1700c of printhead die 1700, and data lines 208f and 208h are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1700d of printhead die 1700.<br><br>
The conductive fire lines 214a-214f are located along ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708 to supply energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6 to the fire groups 1702a-1702f, respectively. The fire lines 214a-214f supply energy to firing resistors 52 in conducting pre-charged firing cells 120 to heat and eject ink from drop generators 60. To uniformly eject ink from each drop generator 60 in a fire group 1702a-1702f, the corresponding fire line 214a-214f is configured to uniformly supply energy to each firing resistor 52 in the fire group 1702a-1702f.<br>
Energy variation is the maximum percent difference in power dissipated through any two firing resistors 52 in one of the fire groups 1702a-1702f. The highest amount of power is found in the first firing resistor 52 of a fire group 1702a-1702f, the firing resistor 52 nearest the bond pad receiving the energy signal FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6, as only a single firing resistor 52 is energized. The lowest amount of power is found in the last firing resistor 52 of a fire group 1702a-1702f as all firing resistors 52 in a row subgroup are energized. Layout contributions to energy variation include fire line width, ground line width, metal thickness and the length of the fire line 214a-214f. One embodiment of ground line layout and sizing is depicted and disclosed in co-pending patent application Serial No. [Not Yet Assigned], entitled "Fluid Ejection Device", filed on the same date as the current application and assigned to the Assignee of this application, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Energy variations of 10 to 15 percent are preferred and energy variations up to 20 percent have been found to be suitable energy variations.<br>
Fire groups 1702a-1702f and fire lines 214a-214f are laid out along ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708 to achieve a suitable energy variation. The pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 1702a-1702f are located along opposing sides of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708. Instead of having all pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 1702a-1702f along the entire length of one side of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708, the pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 1702a-1702f are located along half of the length of each of the opposing sides of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708. The length of the corresponding fire line 214a-214f is reduced to half the length of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708 from one end of the ink feed slot 1704, 1706 and 1708, as compared to<br><br>
:he entire length of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 and 1708. Each of the fire lines 214a-214f are disposed on both sides of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708 and electrically coupled at one end of the ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708 to Form a substantially U-shaped fire line 214a-214f. The substantially U-shaped fire lines 214a-214f are effectively half the length of a fire line that extends the entire length of an ink feed slot 1704,1706 and 1708. The table below compares energy variation for substantially U-shaped fire lines 214a-214f with that of linear fire lines, that is, fire lines that run the entire length of one side of an ink feed slot 1704,1706 and 1708.<br><br>
As shown in the table, using a linear fire group with the same fire line, ground line and die width results in a larger and unsuitable energy variation (11 percent verses 52 percent). The energy variation difference is improved slightly by increasing metal thickness by four times to reduce fire line resistance. However, the energy variation is still unsuitable (11 percent verses 36 percent). Alternatively, to reduce the energy variation to 11 percent in a linear fire group arrangement, the die width is increased.<br>
The substantially U-shaped fire lines 214a-214f are electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 located along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slots 1704,1706 and 1708. Fire line 214a is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 at 1702a. The fire line 214a is disposed<br><br>
along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1704 and extends from one and of ink feed slot 1704 to half the length of ink feed slot 1704 in the y-direction. The fire line 214a supplies energy signal FIRE1 and energy pulses to FG1 at 1702a.<br>
Fire line 214b is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG2 at 1702b. The fire line 214b is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1706 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1706 to half the length of ink feed slot 1706 in the y-direction. The fire line 214b supplies energy signal FIRE2 and energy pulses to FG2 at 1702b.<br>
Fire line 214c is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG3 at 1702c. The fire line 214c is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1708 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1708 to half the length of ink feed slot 1708 in the y-direction. The fire line 214c supplies the energy signal FIRE3 and energy pulses to FG3 at 1702c.<br>
Fire line 214d is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG4 at 1702d. The fire line 214d is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1704 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1704 to half the length of ink feed slot 1704 in the y-direction. The fire line 214d supplies the energy signal FIRE4 and energy pulses to FG4 at 1702d.<br>
Fire line 214e is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG5 at 1702e. The fire line 214e is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1706 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1706 to half the length of ink feed slot 1706 in the y-direction. The fire line 214e supplies the energy signal FIRE5 and energy pulses to FG5 at 1702e.<br>
Fire line 214f is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 at 1702f. The fire line 214f is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1708 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1708 to half the length of ink feed slot 1708 in the y-direction. The fire line 214f supplies the energy signal FIRE6 and energy pulses to FG6 at 1702f.<br>
Figure 23 is a diagram illustrating a plan view of a section 1820 of one embodiment of printhead die 1700. The section 1820 is located in the channel between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706, and adjacent data line groups D6 at<br><br>
1720a and 1720b. The section 1820 includes address lines 1806a-1806g, fire lines 214a and 214b and data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h. In addition, section 1820 includes cross-connection lines 1822a-1822c. The address lines 1806a-1806g, data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h and fire lines 214a and 214b are disposed parallel to each other and parallel to the length of ink feed slots 1704 and 1706. The cross-connection lines 1822a-1822c are disposed orthogonal to ink feed slots 1704 and 1706.<br>
The address lines 1806a-1806g and data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are conductive lines formed as part of first layer metal. The fire lines 214a and 214b are conductive lines formed as part of second layer metal and cross-connection lines 1822a-1822c are formed as part of polysilicon. The polysilicon layer is insulated from the first layer metal by a first insulating layer. The first layer metal is separated and insulated from the second layer metal by a second insulating layer.<br>
The address lines 1806a-1806g are disposed between fire lines 214a and 214b, such that address lines 1806a-1806g and fire lines 214a and 214b do not overlap. Overlapping substantially all of address lines 1806a-1806g and fire lines 214a and 214b along the length of ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 is minimized to reduce cross-talk between fire lines 214a and 214b and address lines 1806a-1806g, as compared to the cross-talk between overlapping fire lines 214a and 214b and address lines 1806a-1806g. The data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h and fire lines 214a and 214b overlap along the length of ink feed slots 1704 and 1706.<br>
The address lines 1806a-1806g receive address signals ~A1, ~A2, ... ~A7 from onboard address generator 1800a and data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h receive data signals ~D2, ~D4, ~D6 and ~D8 from external circuitry. The cross-connection lines 1822a-1822c are electrically coupled to selected data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h or selected address lines 1806a-1806g through vias between the polysilicon layer and first layer metal. The cross-connection lines 1822a-1822c receive and supply signals across the channel between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706, to the individual pre-charged firing cells<br><br>
120. The fire lines 214a and 214b receive fire signals FIRE1 and FIRE2 from external circuitry.<br>
The routing scheme in section 1820 is used between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706, between ink feed slots 1706 and 1708, between ink feed slot 1704 and one side 1700a of printhead die 1700, and between ink feed slot 1708 and the other side 1700b of printhead die 1700.<br>
Figure 24 is a diagram illustrating an example layout of one embodiment of a printhead die 1900. The printhead die 1900 includes components that are similar to components in printhead die 1700 and similar numbers are used for similar components. The printhead die 1900 includes data lines 208a-208h, fire lines 214a-214f, ink feed slots 1704,1706 and 1708, and the six fire groups, indicated at 1702a-1702f. In addition, printhead die 1900 includes address generator 1902, address latch 1904, address lines 1908a-1908g and latched address lines 1910a-1910g. Address generator 1902 is electrically coupled to address lines 1908a-1908g and address latch 1904 is electrically coupled to latched address lines 1910a-1910g. In addition, address generator 1902 is electrically coupled to address latch 1904 through interconnect lines 1906a-1906g.<br>
One embodiment of address generator 1902 is similar to address generator 1200 shown in Figure 15. Accordingly, a suitable embodiment of address generator 1902 can be implemented as illustrated in Figures 9-12.<br>
Address latch 1904 is one embodiment of an address generator and may be utilized in lieu of a second address generator on printhead die 1900. While address generator 1902 generates addresses based on all external signals (e.g., CSYNC and Timing Signals T1-T6), address latch 1904 generates addresses based on a received internal address provided by address generator 1902 and on external timing signals. A suitable embodiment of address latch 1904 is similar to latch circuit 1202, shown in Figure 15, which includes seven latch registers, such as latch register 1220, illustrated in Figures 16 and 17.<br>

The address lines 1908a-1908g and latched address lines 1910a-1910g are electrically coupled to row subgroups as previously described for address lines 206a-206g, respectfully. That is, address line 1908a/1910a is electrically coupled to row subgroups as address line 206a is coupled to row subgroups, address line 1908b/1910b is electrically coupled to row subgroups as address line 206b is coupled to row subgroups and so on, up to and including address line 1908g/1910g being electrically coupled to row subgroups as address line 206g is coupled to row subgroups.<br>

The address generator 1902 supplies valid address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 for three time periods. During these three time periods, select signals SEL1, SEL2 and SEL3 are supplied to fire groups 1702a-1702c, respectively, one select signal SEL1, SEL2 or SEL3 per time period. The address latch 1904 latches in valid address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 as select signal SEL1 is supplied to fire group 1702a. The outputs of the address latch 1904 settle to valid latched address signals ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7 as select signal SEL2 is supplied to fire group 1702b.

During these four time periods, select signals SEL3, SEL4, SEL5 and SEL6 are supplied to fire groups 1702c-1702f, respectively, one select signal SEL3, SEL4, SEL5 or SEL6 per time period.<br>
The address generator 1902 changes address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 to address the next row subgroup of the thirteen row subgroups after the time period including select signal SEL3. The new address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 are valid before the beginning of the next cycle and the time period including select signal SELL The address latch 1904 latches in the new address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 after the time period including select signal SEL6. The latched address signals ~B1, ~B2, ...~B7 are valid during the next cycle before the time period including select signal SEL3.<br><br>
In one cycle through fire groups 1702a-1702f, address generator 1902 supplies address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...-A7 to fire groups 1702a, 1702b and the first part of 1702c as select signals SEL1, SEL2 and SEL3 are supplied to fire groups 1702a, 1702b and 1702c.

The address generator 1902 and address latch 1904 supply the same address on address lines 1908a-1908g and latched address lines 1910a-1910g during one cycle through fire groups 1702a-1702f.<br>
The address generator 1902 is disposed adjacent address latch 1904 in one corner of printhead die 1900 bounded by printhead die side 1900b and printhead die side 1900c. With address generator 1902 and address latch 1904 adjacent one another, the reliability of passing address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 from address generator 1902 to address latch 1904 is improved as compared to passing address signals ~A1, ~A2, ...~A7 through longer interconnect lines 1906a-1906g.<br>
In other embodiments, address generator 1902 and address latch 1904 can be disposed in different locations on printhead die 1900. In one embodiment, address generator 1902 can be disposed in the corner of printhead die 1900 bounded by printhead die side 1900b and printhead die side 1900c, and address latch 1904 can be disposed between fire groups 1702c and 1702f along printhead die side 1900b.

In one embodiment, data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g are not routed the entire length of ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708. Instead, each of the data lines 208a, 208c, 208e and 208g is routed to its<br><br>
respective data line group from a bond pad located along the side of printhead die 1900 nearest the data line group in fire groups 1702a-1702f. Data lines 208a and 208c are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1900c of printhead die 1900, and data lines 208e and 208f are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1900d of printhead die 1900.<br>
Data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 and between ink feed slot 1708 and printhead die side 1900b. Each of the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h routed between ink feed slots 1704 and 1706 is electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 in four fire groups 1702a, 1702b, 1702d and 1702e.

In one embodiment, the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h are not routed the entire length of ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708. Instead, each of the data lines 208b, 208d, 208f and 208h is routed to its respective data line group from a bond pad located along the side of printhead die 1900 nearest the data line group in fire groups 1702a-1702f. Data line 208b and 208d are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1900c of printhead die 1900, and data lines 208f and 208h are electrically coupled to a bond pad along side 1900d of printhead die 1900.<br>
The conductive fire lines 214a-214f are located along ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708 to supply energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6 to fire groups 1702a-1702f, respectively. The fire lines 214a-214f supply energy to firing<br><br>
resistors 52 in conducting pre-charged firing cells 120 to heat and eject ink from drop generators 60. To uniformly eject ink from each drop generator 60 in a fire group 1702a-1702f, the corresponding fire line 214a-214f is configured to uniformly supply energy to each firing resistor 52 in the fire group 1702a-1702f.<br>
Energy variation is the maximum percent difference in power dissipated through any two firing resistors 52 in one of the fire groups 1702a-1702f. The highest amount of power is found in the first firing resistor 52 of a fire group 1702a-1702f as only a single firing resistor 52 is energized, where the first firing resistor 52 is the firing resistor 52 nearest the bond pad receiving the energy signal FIRE1, FIRE2 ... FIRE6. The lowest amount of power is found in the last firing resistor 52 of a fire group 1702a-1702f as all firing resistors 52 in a row subgroup are energized. Layout contributions to energy variation include fire line width, ground line width, metal thickness and the length of the fire line 214a-2141 Energy variations of 10 to 15 percent are preferred and energy variations up to 20 percent have been found to be suitable energy variations.<br>
Fire groups 1702a-1702f and fire lines 214a-214f are laid out along ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708 to achieve a suitable energy variation. The pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 1702a-1702f are located along opposing sides of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708. Instead of having all pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 1702a-1702f along the entire length of one side of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708, the pre-charged firing cells 120 in a fire group 1702a«1702f are located along half of the length of each of the opposing sides of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708. The length of the corresponding fire line 214a-214f is reduced to half the length of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708 from one end of the ink feed slot 1704, 1706 and 1708, as compared to the entire length of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 and 1708. Each of the fire lines 214a-214f are disposed on both sides of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708 and electrically coupled at one end of the ink feed slot 1704, 1706 or 1708 to form a substantially U-shaped fire line 214a-214f. The substantially U-shaped fire lines 214a-214f are effectively half the length of a fire line that extends the entire length of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 and 1708. The table below compares energy variation for substantially U-shaped fire lines 214a-214f with<br><br>
that of linear fire lines, that is, fire lines that run the entire length of one side of an ink feed slot 1704, 1706 and 1708.<br>

ground line and die width results in a larger and unsuitable energy variation (11 percent verses 52 percent). The energy variation difference is improved slightly by increasing metal thickness by four times to reduce fire line resistance. However, the energy variation is still unsuitable (11 percent verses 36 percent). Alternatively, to reduce the energy variation to 11 percent in a linear fire group arrangement, the die width is increased.<br>
The substantially u-shaped fire lines 214a-214f are electrically coupled to pre-charged firing cells 120 disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slots 1704, 1706 and 1708. Fire line 214a is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG1 at 1702a. The fire line 214a is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1704 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1704 to half the length of ink feed slot 1704 in the y-direction. The fire line 214a supplies energy signal FIRE1 and energy pulses to FG1 at 1702a.<br>

half the length of ink feed slot 1706 in the y-direction. The fire line 214b supplies energy signal FIRE2 and energy pulses to FG2 at 1702b.<br>
Fire line 214c is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG3 at 1702c.

The fire line 214c supplies the energy signal FIRE3 and energy pulses to FG3 at 1702c.<br>
Fire line 214d is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG4 at 1702d. The fire line 214d is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1704 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1704 to half the length of ink feed slot 1704 in the y-direction. The fire line 214d supplies the energy signal FIRE4 and energy pulses to FG4 at 1702d.<br>
Fire line 214e is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG5 at 1702e. The fire line 214e is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1706 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1706 to half the length of ink feed slot 1706 in the y-direction. The fire line 214e supplies the energy signal FIRE5 and energy pulses to FG5 at 1702e.<br>
Fire line 214f is electrically coupled to each of the pre-charged firing cells 120 in FG6 at 1702f. The fire line 214f is disposed along each of the opposing sides of ink feed slot 1708 and extends from one end of ink feed slot 1708 to half the length of ink feed slot 1708 in the y-direction. The fire line 214f supplies the energy signal FIRE6 and energy pulses to FG6 at 1702f.<br>
While Figures 21 through 24 depict layouts that show address generators and/or an address latch on the printhead die, the address signals may be provided from an external source as well. Where the address signals are provided from an external source, address generators and/or address latches need not be provided on the printhead die.   In this case, the layouts described in Figures 21 through 24 may be exactly the same.<br>
Referring to Figures 25A and 25B, diagrams illustrating contact areas 2000 of a flex circuit 2002 that may be utilized to couple external circuitry to a printhead die 40 are illustrated. The contact areas 2000 are electrically coupled<br><br>

Enable line contact areas E0-E6 are configured to receive enable signals from an external source and to provide the enable signals, e.g. select signals SEL1-SEL6, precharge signals PRE1-PRE6, and the LATCH signal.   However, it should be noted that the relationship between the lines described with respect to Figures 4-8 and 11-24 and the contact areas E0-E6 need not be one to one, e.g. signal PRE1 need not be provided at contact area EO. All that is required is that appropriate select lines and precharge-lines are coupled to the appropriate enable contact areas.<br>
Data line contact areas D1-D8 are configured to receive signals which provide print data representative of an image to be printed and to provide data signals D1-D8 respectively, to the individual data line groups, e.g. data line groups D1-D8. Fire line contact areas F1-F6 configured to receive energy pulses and to provide the energy signals along fire lines Fire1-Fire6 to the appropriate fire groups, e.g. fire groups 202a-202f and 1702a-1702f. Ground line contact areas GD1-GD6 are configured provide a return path for signals that are conducted by the firing resistors from the fire groups, e.g. fire groups 202a-202f or fire groups 1702a-1702f.

A temperature sense resistor return contact area TSR-RT provides a return path for signals provided at temperature sense resistor contact area TSR. One approach to utilize a temperature sense resistor is described in co-owned patent application serial no.<br>
An identification bit contact area ID is coupled to identification circuitry on printhead die that allows a printer to determine the operating parameters of the printhead die and print cartridge.<br>
In one embodiment, an electrical path between contact areas 2000 and the pre-charged firing cells 120 comprises conductive paths 2004, contacts<br><br>
2006, and the appropriate signal lines, e.g. data lines 208a-208h, pre-charge lines 210a-210f, select lines 212a-212f, or ground lines. It should be noted that pre-charge lines 210a-210f and select lines 212a-212f may be coupled to enable line contact areas E0-E6.<br>
