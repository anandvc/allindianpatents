A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula HetI-C(=O)R" [where R" is OH or a leaving group, such as Cl, Br, F or OC(=O)C1-4 alky]] in an inert organic solvent [such as ethylacetate, dichloromethane, dioxane or DMF] and at a temperature between -10°C and the boiling point of the solvent [preferably at ambient temperature]. If R" is OH, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an activating agent [for example BOP-C1] and two equivalents of a base [such as a tertiary amine, an inorganic carbonate or a hydrogen carbonate]. Alternatively, if R" is a leaving group, the reaction is carried out in the presence of at least one equivalent of base [such as pyridine, a tertiary amine, an inorganic carbonate or a hydrogen carbonate].<br>
Method C<br>
A compound of formula (I) [where R1 is as defined above but is not hydrogen] may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I) [where R1 is hydrogen] with a compound of formula R'-L1 [where R1 is as defined above but is not hydrogen; and L1 is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, a sulfonate (for example a mesylate or a tosylate) or OC(O)C1-4 alkyl] in a solvent [such as a halogenated solvent (for example dichloromethane), an ether, ethylacetate, DMF or even water (as a biphasic mixture, optionally in the presence of a phase transfer<br><br>
catalyst such as tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate)] and in the presence of a base [such as a tertiary amine, an alkali carbonate, an alkali bicarbonate, an alkali hydroxide or NaH; though if L1 is O(CO) C1-4 alkyl then simply heating without base is possible].<br>
Method D<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (IV) [where Hal is preferably bromo or iodo] with a compound of formula Het1-C(=O)NH2 in the presence of a Cu(I) compound and an aprotic solvent [such as a cyclic ether, for example dioxane] at an elevated temperature and preferably at reflux. The preferred conditions are Cul used at 2% to 100%mole/mole, relative to the compound of formula (IV), in the presence of a 1,2-diamine as a ligand-forming substance (such as 1,2-diamino cycJohexane or ethylene diamine) and at least 1 equivalent of a base (such as an alkali carbonate or an alkali phosphate. The article by A-Klapars et al. J.Am.Chem.Soc. 123,7727 (2001) provides details of analogous preparations.<br>
Method E<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by conversion of a compound of formula (V)<br>
  (V)<br>
[where FG is a functional group which is convertible to R6 in one or more synthetic steps]. Functional group interconversions are standard procedures for a person skilled in the art. There are many methods described in the literature, which can be used as such or with modifications according to the functionalities present; Table A gives literature references (some of which also cite further appropriate references) which are specifically relevant to the preparation of a compound of formula (I) by the interconversion of FG to R6' It is apparent to the person skilled in the art that the literature examples given in Table A are not necessarily<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
compound of formula (V) and T is either halogen, nitro, amino, NHR1 or a protected amino group T (for example a carbamate, an amide, a cyclic imide, an N-alkyK N-alkenyl-, N-ben2yK N-diphenylmethyl- or N-trityl-derivative, an inline derivative or an N-silyl- or N-disilyl-derivative). Starting from a compound of formula (VI) the functional group FG may be converted to R by applying a method analogous to method E above. This conversion leads directly to a compound of formula (II) [when T is NHR1], to a compound of formula (HI) [when T is nitro], to a compound of formula (TV) [when T is halogen (preferably chloro, bromo or iodo)] or to a compound of formula (VH) [when T is T].<br>
In a second step a compound of formula (II) [when R1 is other than H], (HI) or (VTT) can be converted to a compound of formula (II) [where R1 is H] by applying the methods as generically described above.<br>
Examples of versatile values forT' plus methods for deprotection are given in T.W.Green and P.Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons 1999), Chapter 7.<br>
Compilations of useful values for T" plus literature to convert T" into NH2, T or NHR1 can be found in M.B. Smith, Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods, Vols. 1-10, Chapter 7 (Wiley, Vol .10: 2002).<br><br>
A compound of formula (II), (HI), (TV) or (VII) may be prepared by a coupling reaction between a compound of formula (VIII) and a compound of formula (IX) [where Ra and Ra' are each, independently, halogen (preferably Cl, Br or I), triflate or a metal-containing<br><br>
functionality containing, for example, B, Sn, Mg, Zn or Cu as the metal; examples are B(OH)2, esters of boronic acid (preferably esters derived from 1,2- or 1,3-diols), trialkyltin (preferably Sn(CH3)3 or Sn(nBu)3), a halogen salt of Mg , a halogen salt of Zn or Cu. If either Ra or Ra' is a metal containing functionality, the other substituent must be halogen or triflate.<br>
Such coupling reactions are widely known in the literature. Especially suitable are the Pd (0), Ni(0), or copper catalysed couplings which are well known to the person skilled in the art as Stille coupling, Suzuki coupling, Negishi coupling or Ullmann reaction. Comprehensive reviews of these reactions can be found in Metal-Catalysed Cross-Coupling Reactions; F.Diederich and P.Stang (eds.); Wiley-VCH; Weinheim 1998 and in Handb. Organopalladium Chem. Org. Synth (2002).<br>
In a second step a compound of formula (II) [when R1 is other than H], (HI) or (VII) can be converted to a compound of formula (II) [where R1 is H] by either applying the methods as generically described above.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the novel compounds of formula (I) have, for practical purposes, a very advantageous spectrum of activities for protecting plants against diseases that are caused by fungi as well as by bacteria and viruses.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be used in the agricultural sector and related fields of use as active ingredients for controlling plant pests. The novel compounds are distinguished by excellent activity at low rates of application, by being well tolerated by plants and by being environmentally safe. They have very useful curative, preventive and systemic properties and<br>
aroused for protecting numerous cultivated plants. The compounds of formula I can be used to inhibit or destroy the pests that occur on plants or parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) of different crops of useful plants, while at the same time protecting also those parts of the plants that grow later e.g. from phytopathogenic microorganisms.<br>
Therefore the invention relates also to a method of controlling or preventing infestation of useful plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, wherein a compound of formula I is applied as acitve ingredient to the plants, to parts thereof or the locus thereof.<br><br>
It is also possible to use compounds of formula (I) as dressing agents for the treatment of plant propagation material, in particular of seeds (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings (for example rice), for the protection against fungal infections as well as against phytopathogenic fungi occurring in the soil.<br>
Furthermore the compounds according to present invention may be used for controlling fungi in related areas, for example in the protection of technical materials, including wood and wood related technical products, in food storage, in hygiene management, etc.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, effective against the phytopathogenic fungi of the following classes: Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Botrytis, Pyricularia, Helminthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora and Alternaria) and Basidiomycetes (e.g. Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia). Additionally, they are also effective against the Ascomycetes classes (e.g. Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula) and of the Oomycetes classes (e.g. Phytophthora, Pythium, Plasmopara). Outstanding activity has been observed against powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.) and rust (Puccinia spp.). Furthermore, the novel compounds of formula I are effective against phytopathogenic bacteria and viruses (e.g. against Xanthornpnas spp, Pseudomonas spp, Erwinia amylovora as well as against the tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Within the scope of the invention, useful plants to be protected typically comprise the following species of plants: cereal (wheat, barley, rye, oat, rice, maize, sorghum and related<br>
spades); beet (sugar'Beet and fodder beet); pomes, drupes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucumber plants (pumpkins, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamomum, camphor) or plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals.<br><br>
The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides like bromoxynil or classes of herbicides (such as, for example, HPPD inhibitors, ALS inhibitors, for example primisulfuron, prosulfuron and trifloxysulfuron, EPSPS (5-enol-pyrovy]-shikimate-3-phosphate-synthase) inhibitors, GS (glutamine synthetase) inhibitors) as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. An example of a crop that has been rendered tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g: imazamox, by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis) is Clearfield® summer rape (Canola). Examples of crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by genetic engineering methods include glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant maize varieties commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady® , Herculex I® and LibertyLink®.<br>
The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of synthesising one or more selectively acting toxins, such as are known, for example, from toxin-producing bacteria, especially those of the genus Bacillus.<br>
Toxins that can be expressed by such transgenic plants include, for exampleTirisecticidal proteins, for example insecticidal proteins from Bacillus cereus or Bacillus popliae; or insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as 5-endotoxins, e.g. CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CryIF(a2), CryIIA(b)&gt; CrylllA, CryfflB(bl) or Cry9c, or vegetative ins?eticidal"prbteins"(VIP), e.g. VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; or insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonising nematodes, for example Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp.&gt; such as Photorhabdus luminescens, Xenorhabdus nematophilus; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins and other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such as Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea lectins, barley lectins or snowdrop lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsine inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin, papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-REP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroidoxidase, ecdysteroid-UDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases,<br><br>
ecdysone inhibitors, HMG-COA-reductase, ion channel blockers, such as Mockers of sodium or calcium channels, juvenile hormone esterase, diuretic hormone receptors, stilbene synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases and glucanases.<br>
In the context of the present invention there are to be understood by 5-endotoxins, for example CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CryIF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylEA, CryI0B(bl) or Cry9c7 or vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), for example VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VTP3A, expressly also hybrid toxins, truncated toxins and modified toxins. Hybrid toxins are produced recombinantly by a new combination of different domains of those proteins (see, for example, WO 02/15701). An example for a truncated toxin is a truncated CrylA(b), which is expressed in the Btl 1 maize from Syngenta Seed SAS, as described below. In the case of modified toxins, one or more amino acids of the naturally occurring toxin are replaced- In such amino acid replacements, preferably non-naturally present protease recognition sequences are inserted into the toxin, such as, for example, in the case of CryIIIAO55, a cathepsin-D-recognition sequence is inserted into a CrylUA toxin (see WO 03/018810)<br>
Examples of such toxins or transgenic plants capable of synthesising such toxins are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 427 529, EP-A-451 878 and WO 03/052073.<br>
The processes for the preparation of such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above.<br>
CryFtype deoxyribonucleic acids and their preparation are known, for example, from WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 367 474, EP-A-0 401 979 and WO 90/13651.<br>
The toxin contained in the transgenic plants imparts to the plants tolerance to harmful insects. Such insects can occur in any taxonomic group of insects, but are especially commonly found in the beetles (Coleoptera), two-winged insects (Diptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera).<br><br>
Transgenic plants containing one or more genes that code for an insecticidal resistance and express one or more toxins are known and some of them are commercially available. Examples of such plants are: YieldGard® (maize variety that expresses a CrylA(b) toxin); YieldGard Rootworm® (maize variety that expresses a CrylDB(bl) toxin); YieldGard Plus® (maize variety that expresses a CrylA(b) and a CryEDB(bl) toxin); Starlink® (maize variety that expresses a Cry9(c) toxin); Herculex I® (maize variety that expresses a CryEF(a2) toxin and the enzyme phosphinothricine N-acetyltransferase (PAT) to achieve tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium); NuCOTN 33B® (cotton variety that expresses a CrylA(c) toxin); Bollgard I® (cotton variety that expresses a CrylA(c) toxin); Bollgard II® (cotton variety that expresses a CrylA(c) and a CryllA(b) toxin); VIPCOT® (cotton variety that expresses a VIP toxin); NewLeaf® (potato variety that expresses a CrylEA toxin); NatureGard® and Protecta®.<br>

Transgenic crops of insect-resistant plants are also described in BATS (Zentrum fur Biosicherheit und Nachhaltigkeit, Zentrum BATS, Clarastrasse 13,4058 Base], Switzerland) Report 2003, (http://bats.ch).<br>
The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of synthesising antipathogenic substances having a selective action, such as, for example, the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PRPs, see e.g. EP-A-0 392 225). Examples of such antipathogenic substances and transgenic plants capable of synthesising such antipathogenic substances are known, for example, from EP-A-0 392 225, WO 95/33818, and EP-A-0 353 191. The methods of producing such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above.<br><br>
Antipathogenic substances which can be expressed by such transgenic plants include, for example, ion channel blockers, such as blockers for sodium and calcium channels, for example the viral KP1, KP4 or KP6 toxins; stilbene synthases; bibenzyl synthases; chitinases; glucanases; the so-called npathogenesis-re]ated proteins" (PRPs; see e.g. EP-A-0 392 225); antipathogenic substances produced by microorganisms, for example peptide antibiotics or heterocyclic antibiotics (see e.g. WO 95/33818) or protein or polypeptide factors involved in plant pathogen defence (so-called "plant disease resistance genes", as described in WO 03/000906).<br>
The term "locus" of a useful plant as used herein is intended to embrace the place on which the useful plants are growing, where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants are sown or where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants will be placed into the soil. An example for such a locus is a field, on which crop plants are growing.<br>
The term "plant propagation material" is understood to denote generative parts of the plant, such as seeds, which can be used for the multiplication of the latter, and vegetative material, such as cuttings or tubers, for example potatoes. There may be mentioned for example seeds (in the strict sense), roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes and parts of plants. Germinated plants and young plants which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from the soil, may also be mentioned. These young plants may be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion. Preferably "plant propagation material" is understood to denote seeds.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation.<br>
Therefore the invention also relates to compositions for controlling and protecting against phytopathogenic microorganisms, comprising a compound of formula I and an inert carrier, and to a method of controlling or preventing infestation of useful plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, wherein a composition, comprising a compound of formula<br><br>
I as acitve ingredient and an inert carrier,is applied to the plants, to parts thereof or the locus thereof.<br>
To this end they are conveniently formulated in known manner to emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granulates, and also encapsulations e.g. in polymeric substances. As with the type of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The compositions may also contain further adjuvants such as stabilizers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders or tackifiers as well as fertilizers, micronutrient donors or other formulations for obtaining special effects.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are substances useful in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers. Such carriers are for example described in WO 97/33890.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the crop area or plant to be treated, simultaneously or in succession with further' compounds. These further compounds can be e.g. fertilizers or micronutrient donors or other preparations which influence the growth of plants. They can also be selective herbicides as<br>
well as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of<br>
- ■—«——— ■     . ^  »■	'*<br>
several of these preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or<br>
application promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of formulation.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula (I), or an agrochemical composition which contains at least one of said compounds, is foliar application. The frequency of application and the rate of application will depend on the risk of infestation by the corresponding pathogen. However, the compounds of formula I can also penetrate the plant through the roots via the soil (systemic action) by drenching the locus of the plant with a liquid formulation, or by applying the compounds in solid form to the soil, e.g. in granular<br><br>
Form (soil application). In crops of water rice such granulates can be applied to the flooded rice field. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seeds (coating) by impregnating the seeds or tubers either with a liquid formulation of the fungicide or coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
A formulation [that is, a composition containing the compound of formula (I)) and, if desired, a solid or liquid adjuvant, is prepared in a known manner, typically by intimately mixing and/or grinding the compound with extenders, for example solvents, solid carriers and, optionally, surface active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The agrochemical formulations will usually contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of the compound of formula I, 99.9 to 1% by weight, preferably 99.8 to 5% by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 5g to 2kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from 1Og to 1kg a.i ./ha, most preferably from 20g to 600g a.i./ha.<br>
When used as seed drenching agent, convenient dosages are from lOmg to lg of active substance per kg of seeds.<br>
The rate of application for the desired action can be determined by experiments. It<br>
depends for example on the type of action, the developmental stage of the useful plant, and on the the application (location, timing, application method) and can, owing to these parameters, vary within wide limits.<br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutical salt thereof, described above have also an advantageous spectrum of activity for the treatment and/or prevention of microbial infection in an animal.<br>
"Animal" can be any animal, for example, insect, mammal, reptile, fish, amphibian, preferably mammal, most preferably human. 'Treatment" means the use on an animal which has microbial infection in order to reduce or slow or stop the increase or spread of the infection, or to reduce the infection or to cure the infection. "Prevention" means the use on an animal which has no apparent signs of microbial infection in order to prevent any future infection, or to reduce or slow the increase or spread of any future infection.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided the use of a compound of formula I in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment and/or prevention of microbial infection in an animal. There is also provided the use of a compound of formula I as a pharmaceutical agent. There is also provided the use of a compound of formula I as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of an animal. According to the present invention there is also provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. This composition can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of antimicrobial infection in an animal. This pharmaceutical composition can be in a form suitable for oral administration, such as tablet, lozenges, hard capsules, aqueous suspensions, oily suspensions, emulsions dispersible powders, dispersible granules, syrups and elixirs.<br>
AttSrnatively this pHarmaceutical composition can be in a form suitable for topical application, such as a spray, a cream or lotion. Alternatively this pharmaceutical composition can be in a form suitable for parenteral administration, for example injection. Alternatively this pharmaceutical composition can be in inhalable form, such as an aerosol spray.<br>
The compounds of formula I are effective against various microbial species able to cause a microbial infection in an animal. Examples of such microbial species are those causing Aspergillosis such as Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terms, A. nidulans and A. niger; those causing Blastomycosis such as Blastomyces dermatitidis; those causing<br><br>
Candidiasis such as Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicaiis, C parapsilosis, C. krusei and C. lusitaniae; those causing Coccidioidomycosis such as Coccidioides immitis; those causing Cryptococcosis such as Cryptococcus neoformans; those causing Histoplasmosis such as Histoplasma capsulatum and those causing Zygomycosis such as Absidia corymbifera, Rhizomucor pusillus and Rhizopus arrhizus. Further examples are Fusarium Spp such as Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani and Scedosporium Spp such as Scedosporium apiospermum and Scedosporium prolificans. Still further examples are Microsporum Spp, Trichophyton Spp, Epidermophyton Spp, Mucor Spp, Sporothorix Spp, Phialophora Spp, Cladosporium Spp, Petriellidium spp, Paracoccidioides Spp and Histoplasma Spp.<br>
