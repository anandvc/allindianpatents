METHOD  OF   DETECTING  HUMAN   PAPILLOMA  VIRUS BY  USING  NUCLEIC  ACID AMPLIFICATION  METHOD AND  NUCLEIC  ACID  CHAIN-IMMOBILIZED  CARRIER<br>
Technical   Field<br>
The  present   invention relates  to a  nucleic  acid primer   sequence,   a   kit,   and a   nucleic acid  chain-immobilized  carrier   for  detection  of  human  papilloma virus   and  identification  of  its   genotype,   and  a  method of   detecting human  papilloma  virus  by using  a   nucleic acid   amplification  method.<br>
Background  Art<br>
Human  papilloma  virus   (HPV)   infection  was   reported as   a   cause  of  uterine  cervical   cancer  in  the   1980's, and   in  particular,   the  relationship between  cancer malignancy  and  HPV  genotype   is   attracting  attention. HPV  is   also  considered  to be  the   cause  of  cancers  other than   uterine  cervical   cancer   such   as  cancers   of   the genital   organs   and  oral  mucosa,   and  there  has   been  a demand   for  a  rapid  and  accurate  method of. detecting HPV.      Hitherto   known  were  a method  of detecting   a malignant   or  benign   genotype   by   using  a   DNA/RNA-recognizing  antibody,   and a  method  of amplifying  a region  containing   a   sequence   characteristic  to  a genotype   in  polymerase   chain   reaction   (PCR)   and identifying  the   genotype   finally  by  using  a   genotype-specific  probe.      However,   the   former method,   which  does<br>
not identify the genotype, is not applicable to the test for vaccine administration currently under development.  Alternatively, the latter method of using the PCR method had disadvantages such as complicated procedure of pretreatment for example nucleic acid extraction, demand for a complex temperature-regulating device such as thermal cycler, and longer reaction period of two hours or more.  In addition, the PCR method has a possibility that, if an incorrect complementary strand happens to be synthesized, the product may be used as a template in amplification, consequently leading to incorrect judgment.  Actually, it is difficult to control specific amplification only with' a difference of one nucleotide at the terminal of a primer.<br>
For detection by using a DNA chip, gene products amplified by the PCR method are generally double-stranded chains.  Thus, there emerged a problem that the complementary strands became competitors to the probe, lowering hybridization efficiency and detection sensitivity in the hybridization reaction with a probe. Accordingly, for example, a method of decomposing or separating the complementary strand is employed to make the target gene product into a single strand.  However, these methods still have problems such as the higher cost and complicated procedure because of the use of enzymes or magnetic beads, and there exists a need for<br>
a new method replacing such conventional methods.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a nucleic acid primer for detection of an HPV nucleotide sequence present in LAMP amplification products when principle of a LAMP method allowing simple and rapid detection of nucleic acids is applied, and an HPV-detection method using the nucleic acid primer.<br>
The inventions employed a method different from the PCR method, i.e., LAMP method, for identification of the HPV genotype.  Thus, it is possible to identify the genotype easily.  However, the LAMP products, which have complicated high-order structures, cause physical hindrance with the probe-bound support during hybridization, which in turn lead to deterioration of the hybridization efficiency (see, for example, JP-A 2005-095043(KOKAI)).  Accordingly, in the present invention, the primer is so designed that the human papilloma virus-derived target sequence becomes located in the single-stranded loop region of the LAMP product, differently from before.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a nucleic acid primer for LAMP amplification for use in the detection of human papilloma virus and identification of its genotype, the nucleic acid primer being selected from the following (a)-(f); (a) a nucleic acid primer containing, on the<br>
came chain, a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in a first sequence group listed in Table 1 and a sequence selected from those in a second sequence group listed in Table z; (b) a nucleic acid primer containing, on the same chain, a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the first sequence group and a sequence selected from those in z   third sequence group listed in Table 3; (c) a nucleic acid primer containing, on the same chain, a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the second sequence group and a sequence selected from those in the third sequence group; (d) a nucleic acid primer containing a sequence that differs from a selected sequence of one of the nucleic acid primers (a) , (b), and (c) , by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more bases, and capable to hybridize with a nucleic acid chain having a sequence complementary to the selected sequence of one of the nucleic acid primers (a), (b), and (c) ; (e) a nucleic acid primer containing a sequence selected from those in a fourth sequence group listed in Table 4 or a sequence complementary thereto; and (f) a nucleic acid primer containing a sequence that differs from a selected sequence of one of the nucleic acid primers (e), by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more bases, and capable to hybridize with a nucleic acid chain having a sequence complementary to the<br>
selected sequence  of  one of   the   nucleic  acid  primers<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of detecting human papilloma virus and identifying its genotype, comprising a step of amplifying the nucleic acid chains in a sample in LAMP reaction by using multiple primers including at least one primer selected from the nucleic acid primers above and a step of detecting presence of amplified products after the amplification reaction and identifying their genotypes.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a nucleic acid chain-immobilized support carrying an immobilized human papilloma virus- or genotype-specific nucleic acid chain for detection of human-papilloma-virus LAMP amplification products.  Preferably, the nucleic acid chain immobilized is (g) a nucleic acid probe containing a sequence selected from those in a fifth sequence group listed in Table 5 or a sequence complementary thereto, or (h) a nucleic acid probe containing a sequence that differs from a selected sequence of one of the nucleic acid probe (g), by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more bases, and capable to hybridize with a nucleic acid chain having a sequence complementary to the selected sequence of one of the nucleic "acid probe (g) .<br>

Best MCCIP for Carrying Out the Invention An amplification method used in the present invention, the "LAMP method", is a kind of isothermal polymerase chain reaction, and uses 4 or 6 kinds of primers.  The LAMP method is reported to be higher in amplification efficiency than the PCR method and also resistant to the influence by impurities in a sample. It is thus possible to detect human papilloma virus in a smaller amount easily with simple pretreatment of the sample.<br>
The primer design and amplification products obtained in the LAMP method will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.  FIG. 1 shows a double strand DNA to be detected.  Conventionally, a target sequence has been located in the center of a stem-and-loop structure of LAMP amplification products (FIG. 2). In amplifying and detecting the target sequence, a total of four kinds of primer sequences (FIP, F3, BIP, and B3 primers) are determined from the sequences located at both sides of the target sequence.  The FIP and BIP primers each contain two regions (FIP = Flc + F2, BIP = B2 + Blc).  A total of six regions used in these primers will be called primer regions below. LAMP amplification by using the four kinds of primers gives amplification products with the dumbbell-shaped stem-and-loop structure shown in FIG. 2, each of them being complementary to each strand of the DNA shown in<br>
Fin  1.  The amplification mechanism is not dtiacribed here, but may be referred, for c::c~:ple, to in JP-A 2002-186781(KOKAI),<br>
On the other hand, in the present invention, the primers are designed such that the target sequence is placed in the  single-stranded loop region, unlike the conventional target-sequence site shown in FIG. 2. Specifically as shown in FIG. 3, in the invention, six primer regions are so placed that the target sequence (any one of FPc, FP, BP, and BPc in FIG. 3) is located between primer regions Fl and F2 (including F2 region), between primer regions F2c and Flc (including F2c region), between primer regions Bl and B2 (including B2 region), and/or between primer-regions B2c and Blc (including B2c region).  The target sequence may be placed in any one of the single-stranded loop regions formed between the regions above, and thus, the loop region between primer regions Fl and F2 includes the F2 region.  A part of LAMP amplification products, which is shown in FIG. 4, are obtained by preparing four kinds of primers according to the six primer regions thus determined and performing LAMP amplification by using these primers.  In the LAMP amplification products, target sequences FPc, FP, BP, and BPc are located in the single-stranded loops in the dumbbell structure of the amplification products.  On the other hand, primer regions Flc and Fl, and Blc and Bl, have<br>
sequences complementary to each other, and thus, IOMM double strands by selfhybridization.  Some of the target sequences contained in the amplification products are in the single stranded state as shown in FIG. 4.  For this reason, it is possible to detect the target sequences by specific hybridization to probe nucleic acids (FP, FPc, BP, and BPc) complimentary to respective target sequences without denaturation processing, as shown in the figure.  The term "specific hybridization" means that it is possible to detect a slight difference caused by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or mutation if present.<br>
The present invention detects the genotype of HPV virus by applying such a primer structure to HPV virus.<br>
A sequence shown in FIG. 11 is an HPV virus sequence.  A region containing SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the figure is known to be preserved among many HPV viruses.  Alternatively, the SEQ ID No. 4 shows a region where it is known that there is polymorphism between malignant and benign tumors.  In detecting the HPV viral genotype, polymorphism is detected, for example, by using a sequence of the region corresponding to the SEQ ID No. 4 as a target sequence. In such a case, for example, sequences selected from first sequence group (Table 1) and second sequence group (Table 2), or for example sequences selected from first sequence group and third sequence group (Table<br>
3), are used as the sequence corresponding to the primer regions Fl and F2.  The first, second, and third sequence groups are the sequence groups shown in the following Tables 1 to 3, and respectively correspond to the regions of SEQ ID No. 1, 2, and 3 in FIG. 11.  The sequence in these regions varies according to its viral type, and is not always identical with the sequence shown in FIG. 11.  In addition, z  primer set consisting of BIP and B3 primers is also needed in actual LAMP amplification.  It is possible to use the sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 5 and 6 in FIG. 11 or the complementary sequences thereof.  The primer according to the invention for use is preferably a primer having, on the same chain in the direction from 5' to 3', a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the first sequence group and a sequence selected from those in the second sequence group bound to each other, a sequence selected from those in the second sequence group and a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the first sequence group bound to each other, a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the first sequence group and a sequence selected from those in the third sequence group bound to each other, a sequence selected from those in the third sequence group and a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the first sequence group bound to each other, a sequence<br>
complementary Lo a sequence selected from those in the second sequence group and a sequence selected from those in the third sequence group bound to each other, a sequence selected from those in the third sequence group and a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the second sequence group bound to each other, a sequence selected from those in the fourth sequence group (Table 4), or a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the fourth sequence group.  The complementary sequences include strictly complementary sequences and also sequences that can hybridize under a condition stringent to the sequence groups above.  Generally under such a condition, a sequential homology of 90 to 95% seems to be sufficient for progress of the reaction.  Such a stringent condition would be obvious for those skilled in the art, and is, for example, a temperature in the range of 20°C to 65°C, 2 x SSC buffer solution, and 0.1% w/v SDS.  Particularly favorable is a highly stringent condition at a temperature of at least 65°C, 0.1 x SSC buffer solution, and 0.1% w/v SDS.  Alternatively, the sequence may be sequences of at least one of the strands of SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3 or the complementary strands thereof that have one or more nucleotides (e.g., 1 to 5 nucleotides) thereof substituted, deleted, or inserted.  However, these substituted, deleted, or inserted sequences are<br><br>
sequences that can hybridize respectively with the complementary strands of unsubstituted, undeleted, or uninserted sequences under the stringent condition.  In addition, at least one of SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and the complementary strands thereof may be a mixed-nucleotide sequence of 1 to 5 nucleotides, or at least one of SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and the complementary strands thereof may be a sequence of 1 to 5 nucleotides bring a universal nucleotide.  Examples of the universal nucleotides for use include deoxyinosine (dI), and 3-Nitropyrrole, 5-Nitroindole, deoxyribofuranosyl (dP) , deoxy-5'-dimethoxytrityl-D-ribofuranosyl (dK) available from Gren Research.  It would be obvious for those skilled in the art that these primer regions may be bound to each other directly or via a spacer in the primer according to the invention.  A sequence (spacer) of about 1 to 100 nucleotides, preferably 2 to 30 nucleotides, may be present between the sequences or at the terminal of the primer.  The length of the nucleic acid primer is about 15 to 200 nucleotides, preferably 20 to 100 nucleotides, and more preferably 40 to 60 nucleotides. It is possible to amplify the polymorphic region only by using sequences in combination of those in the sequence groups 1 to 3 or in the sequence group 4 as the sequence corresponding to the primer regions Fl and F2, or Bl and B2 in the primer for detection of HPV<br><br>
viral genoLype according to the present invention -  It is thus possible to detect the polymorpnism present in SEQ ID No. 4 contained in LAMP amplification product with the probe.  Accordingly, the target sequence FPc, FP, BP, or BPc located in the single-stranded loop of the dumbbell structure of the product amplified with the LAMP primer correspond to the sequence of SEQ ID No. 4.<br>
As described in FIG. 4, it is possible to obtain an HPV-derived target sequence (i.e., sequence in the region corresponding to SEQ ID No. 4) contained in a single-stranded loop structure of a amplification product having a stem-and-loop structure, by amplification by the LAMP method of an HPV-containing sample with the above-mentioned primers in the structure having primer regions Fl and F2.<br>
The amplification reaction may be carried out by using one primer set per tube or multiple primer sets for various genotypes per tube.  It is more efficient to use the latter method for identification of multiple genotypes at the same time.<br>
The amplification products are detected, for example, by using probe nucleic acids (FP, FPc, BP, and BPc) having a sequence complementary to the SEQ ID No. 4.  Homogeneous hybridization is achieved by using nucleic acid probe labeled by such as fluorochrome (Fluorescein, Rhodamine, FITC, FAM, TET, JOE, VIC, MAX,<br><br>
ROX.- HEX, TAMRA, Cy3," Cy5, TexacRed, etc.), quencher(TAMRA, Eclipoe, babcyl, Au colloid, etc.), electron spin material and metal complex(Ruthenium, Cobalt, Iron, etc.).  For example molecular beacon, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electron spin resonance (ESR) technologies are often used for homogeneous hybridization using labeled probe. Invader and pyrosequenching technologies are also used for homogeneous hybridization without labeling. Homogeneous hybridization assay for LAMP products is not particularly limited.  The probe nucleic acids may be immobilized on the surface of a solid support for heterogeneous hybridization, and typically, a DNA chip is used, but a probe on another microarray may be used. As described above, the region of the SEQ ID No. 4 is a polymorphic region, and thus, the probe nucleic acids for detection of amplified products may be altered according to the polymorphism to be detected.<br>
The nucleic acid probe sequence for use in the present invention is preferably a nucleic acid probe having a sequence containing a sequence selected from those in the fifth sequence group (Table 5) or a sequence complementary to a sequence selected from those in the fifth sequence group, or the sequence selected from those in the fifth sequence group or the sequence of the complementary to a sequence thereof of which one or more nucleotides are substituted, deleted<br><br>
or insertion.  it is also possible to use trie sequences described in Kieter et ai., J. Clin. Microbiol., 37, 2508-17 (1999); Vernon et al., BMC Infectious Diseases, 3:12 (2003); JP-A 09-509062(KOKAI) and others.  The structure of the nucleic acid probe is also not particularly limited, and DNA, RNA, PNA, LNA, methyl phosphonate-skeleton nucleic acid, and other synthetic nucleic acid chains may also be used.  In addition, the chimeric nucleic acids thereof may also be used.  It is also possible to introduce a functional group such as amino group, thiol group, or biotin, for immobilization of the nucleic acid probe on a solid support, and a spacer may also be introduced additionally between the functional group and the nucleotide.  The kind of the spacer used herein is not particularly limited, and, for example, an alkane or ethylene glycol skeleton may be used.  Examples of the universal nucleotides for use in the present invention include deoxyinosine (dl) and 3-Nitropyrrole, 5-Nitroindole, deoxyribofuramsyl (dP), and deoxy-5'-dimethoxytrityl-D-ribofuranosyl (dK) available from Gren Research, and the like.<br>
The detection method for use in the invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include optical methods of using turbidity, visible light, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, chemifluorescence, fluorescent energy transfer, ESR, or the like, and<br><br>
electrical methods of using an electrical property such as electrical current, voltage, frequency, conductivity, or resistance.<br>
The support for immobilizing the nucleic acid probe for use in the invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include particles (e.g., resin beads, magnetic beads, metal fine particles, and gold colloid), plates (e.g., microtiter plate, glass plate, silicon plate, resin plate, electrode plate, and membrane), and the like.<br>
The raw material for the support for use in the invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include permeable materials such as a porous material and membrane and"non-permeable materials such as glass and resin.  Typical examples of the support materials include inorganic insulation materials such as glass, quartz glass, alumina, sapphire, forsterite, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, and silicon nitride, and organic materials such as polyethylene, ethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polymethyl methacrylate, polyethylene terephthalate, unsaturated polyesters, fluorine-containing resins, polyvinyl chloride, polychlorinated vinylidene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinyl acetal, acrylic resins, polyacrylonitrile, polystyrene, acetal resins, polycarbonate, polyamide, phenol resins, urea resins, epoxy resins, melamine resins, styrene-acrylonitrile<br><br>
copolymers, acylonitra1e butadiene styrene copolymers, silicone resins  polypnenyleneoxide, polysulfone, polyethylene glycol, agarose, acrylamide, nitrocellulose, nylon, and latex.<br>
The support surface on which the nucleic acid chain is immobilized may be formed, for example, with an electrode material.  The electrode material is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include pure metals such as gold, gold alloys, silver, platinum, mercury, nickel, palladium, silicon, germanium, gallium, and tungsten, and the alloys thereof; carbon materials such as graphite and glassy carbon; and the oxides and compounds thereof.  Other examples include semiconductor compounds such as silicon oxide, and various semiconductor devices such as CCD, FET, and CMOS.  The electrode can be produced by plating, printing, sputtering, vapor deposition, or the like. An electrode film may be formed in vapor deposition by resistance heating, high-frequency heating, or electron beam heating.  When in sputtering, the electrode film may be formed by DC bipolar sputtering, bias sputtering, asymmetric AC sputtering, getter sputtering, or high-frequency sputtering.  It is also possible to use an electrolytic-polymerization membrane such as polypyrrole or polyaniline or a conductive polymer.  The material for insulating the area other than the electrode is not particularly limited, but<br><br>
preferably, a photopolymer or   a photoresist material. Examples of the resist materials for use include photoresists for light irradiation, photoresists for far-ultraviolet light, photoresists for X-ray irradiation, and photoresists for electron beam irradiation.  Examples of the photoresists for light irradiation include photoresists containing cyclized rubber, poiycinnamic acid or novolak resin as the main raw material.  A cyclized rubber, a phenol resin, polymethylisopropenylketone (PMIPK), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), or the like is used as the far-ultraviolet photoresist.  Any one of COP, metal acrylate, as well as the substances described in the Thin Film Handbook (published by Ohmsha) may be used for the X-ray resist.  Further, the substances described in the literature above such as PMMA may be used for the electron-beam resist.  The resist for use desirably has a thickness of 100A or more and 1 mm or less.  It is possible to make the area constant by covering the electrode with a photoresist and performing lithography.  It is thus possible to uniformize the amount of DNA probe immobilized between electrodes and to make the measurement favorable in reproducibility.  The resist material has been generally removed finally, but it is possible to use the resist material as a part of the electrode for gene detection without removal.  In such a case, a substance<br><br>
higher- in water resistance is needed to De uspd as the resist material.  Materials other than the photoresist materials may be used for the insulation layer formed over the electrode.  Examples thereof include oxides, nitrides, and carbides of metals such as Si, Ti, Al, Zn, Pb, Cd, W, Mo, Cr, Ta, and Ni and the alloys thereof.  After a thin film is formed on the material, for example, by sputtering, vapor deposition, or CVD, the electrode-exposed regions are patterned to an area adjusted to a particular value by photolithography.  It is possible to prepare an electrode allowing tests on several kinds of targets by configuring several electrode units and immobilizing different probes thereon on a single chip.  It is also possible to test multiple samples at the same time by configuring several electrode units and immobilizing the same probe thereon on a single chip.  In such a case, multiple electrodes are patterned on a substrate previously by photolithography.  It is effective then to form an insulation film separating individual electrodes for prevention of contact of neighboring electrodes.  The thickness of the insulation film is preferably about 0.1 to 100 micrometers.<br>
The sample to be analyzed in the present invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include blood, serum, leukocyte, urine, feces, semen, saliva, vaginal fluid, tissue, biopsy sample, oral<br><br>
mucosa, cultured cell, sputum, -?.nd the like.  Nucleic acid components are extracted from these samples.  The extracting method is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include liquid-liquid extraction, for example with phenol-chloroform, and solid-liquid extraction by using a carrier.  Commercial nucleic acid-extracting kits such as QIAamp (manufactured by QIAGEN) , or Sumai test (manufactured by Sumitomo Metal Industries) may be used instead.  The extracted nucleic acid components are amplified by LAMP methods, and the amplified product is hybridized with the probe immobilized on the electrode for gene detection.  The reaction is carried out in a buffer solution at an ionic strength in the range of 0.01 to 5 and at a pH in the range of 5 to 10.  Other additives such as hybridization accelerator dextran sulfate, salmon sperm DNA, bovine thymic DNA, EDTA, and surfactant may be added to the solution.  The amplified product is added thereto.  Alternatively, hybridization may be performed by dropping the solution on the substrate.  The reaction may be accelerated, for example, by agitation or shaking during the reaction.  The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 10°C to 90°C, and the reaction period is about 1 minute or more to overnight.  After hybridization reaction, the electrode is separated and washed.  A buffer solution at an ionic strength of 0.01 to 5 and a pH in the range" of 5 to 10<br><br>
is   used  for   washing.<br>
The  extracted  nucleic  acid  sample  can  be  detected, by   labeling  with  a   fluorescent   dye  such  as   FITC,   Cy3, Cy5,   or  rhodamtine;   biotin,   hapten,   an  enzyme   such  as oxidase  or  phosphatase,   or   an   electrochemically  active substance  such  as   ferrocene  or  quinone,   or  by  using  a second probe  previously  labeled  with  the   substance described  above.<br>
For  example  with  an  electrochemically  active  DNA-binding substance,   nucleic  acid  components   are  analyzed in   the  following  manner.     A  substrate  is   first   cleaned, a   DNA-binding   substance   selectively binding   to   the double-stranded  region  formed  on  the  electrode   surface is   allowed   to   react,   and   the   substrate   is   analyzed electrochemically.      The   DNA-binding   substance   for  use is   not  particularly  limited,   and  examples   thereof include Hoechst   33258,   acridine  orange,   quinacrine, daunomycin,   metallointercalators,   bisintercalators   such as  bisacridine,   trisintercalators,   and polyintercalators.      In  addition,   these   intercalators may  be modified   with  an   electrochemically   active metallocomplex   such   as   ferrocene   or  viologen.      The concentration   of   the  DNA-binding   substance  may  vary according  to  the   kind  thereof,   but  is  generally  in  the range  of  1  ng/ml   to   1  mg/ml.     A buffer   solution  at  an ionic   strength   in   the   range   of   0.001   to   5   and  a  pH   in the   range  of   5   to   10   is" used   then.     The   electrode   after<br>
reaction with the DNA-binding   substance is washed and analyzed electrocnemically.  The electrochemical measurement is performed in a three-electrode analyzer including reference, counter, and action electrodes or in a two-electrode analyzer including counter and action electrodes.  During measurement, a voltage high enough to cause electrochemical reaction of the DNA-binding substance is applied, and the reaction current derived from the DNA-binding substance is determined. The voltage may be varied linearly, or may be applied in the pulse shape or at a constant voltage.  The current and voltage during measurement are controlled by using a device such as a potentiostat, a digital multimeter, or a function generator.  The concentration of the target gene is calculated from the measured electric current with a calibration curve.  The gene-detecting device using the gene-detecting electrode includes a gene-extracting unit, a gene-reacting unit, a DNA-binding substance-reacting unit, an electrochemical measurement unit, a washing unit, and others.<br>
