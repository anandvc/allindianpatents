Title: ANTIBACTERIAL QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES<br>
Applicant: Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd. having its principal place of business at Eastgate Village, Eastgate, Little Island, Co Cork, Ireland<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068268		PCT/EP2007/063314<br>
ANTIBACTERIAL QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted quinoline derivatives useful for the 5     treatment of bacterial diseases, including but not limited to diseases caused by<br>
pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium andM. marinum, or pathogenic Staphylococci or Streptococci.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a serious and potentially fatal infection with a world-wide distribution. Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that more than 8 million people contract TB each year, and 2 million people die from tuberculosis yearly. In the last decade, TB cases have<br>
15     grown 20% worldwide with the highest burden in the most impoverished communities. If these trends continue, TB incidence will increase by 41% in the next twenty years. Fifty years since the introduction of an effective chemotherapy, TB remains after AIDS, the leading infectious cause of adult mortality in the world. Complicating the TB epidemic is the rising tide of multi-drug- resistant strains, and the deadly symbiosis<br>
20     with HIV. People who are HIV-positive and infected with TB are 30 times more likely to develop active TB than people who are HlV-negative and TB is responsible for the death of one out of every three people with HIV/AIDS worldwide<br>
Existing approaches to treatment of tuberculosis all involve the combination of multiple 25     agents. For example, the regimen recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service is a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin alone for a further four months. These drugs are continued for a further seven months in patients infected with HIV. For patients infected with multiÂ¬drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, agents such as ethambutol, streptomycin, 30     kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine, ciprofoxacin and<br>
ofloxacin are added to the combination therapies. There exists no single agent that is effective in the clinical treatment of tuberculosis, nor any combination of agents that offers the possibility of therapy of less than six months' duration.<br>
35     There is a high medical need for new drugs that improve current treatment by enabling regimens that facilitate patient and provider compliance. Shorter regimens and those that require less supervision are the best way to achieve this. Most of the benefit from<br><br>
WO 2008/068268<br><br><br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063314<br><br>
treatment comes in the first 2 months, during the intensive, or bactericidal, phase when four drugs are given together; the bacterial burden is greatly reduced, and patients become noninfectious. The 4- to 6-month continuation, or sterilizing, phase is required to eliminate persisting bacilli and to minimize the risk of relapse. A potent sterilizing 5     drug that shortens treatment to 2 months or less would be extremely beneficial. Drugs that facilitate compliance by requiring less intensive supervision also are needed. Obviously, a compound that reduces both the total length of treatment and the frequency of drug administration would provide the greatest benefit.<br>
10     Complicating the TB epidemic is the increasing incidence of multi-drug- resistant<br>
strains or MDR-TB. Up to four percent of all cases worldwide are considered MDR-TB - those resistant to the most effective drugs of the four^drug standard, isoniazid and rifampin. MDR-TB is lethal when untreated and cannot be adequately treated through the standard therapy, so treatment requires up to 2 years of "second-line" drugs. These<br>
15     drugs are often toxic, expensive and marginally effective. In the absence of an effective therapy, infectious MDR-TB patients continue to spread the disease, producing new infections with MDR-TB strains. There is a high medical need for a new drug with a new mechanism of action, which is likely to demonstrate activity against drug resistant, in particular MDR strains.<br>
20<br>
The term "drug resistant" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter is a term well understood by the person skilled in microbiology. A drug resistant Mycobacterium is a Mycobacterium which is no longer susceptible to at least one previously effective drug; which has developed the ability to withstand antibiotic attack by at least one previously<br>
25      effective drug. A drug resistant strain may relay that ability to withstand to its progeny. Said resistance may be due to random genetic mutations in the bacterial cell that alters its sensitivity to a single drug or to different drugs.<br>
MDR tuberculosis is a specific form of drug resistant tuberculosis due to a bacterium resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin (with or without resistance to other drugs),<br>
30     which are at present the two most powerful anti-TB drugs. Thus, whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter "drug resistant" includes multi drug resistant.<br>
Another factor in the control of the TB epidemic is the problem of latent TB. In spite of decades of tuberculosis (TB) control programs, about 2 billion people are infected by 35     M. tuberculosis, though asymptomaticaliy. About 10% of these individuals are at risk of developing active TB during their lifespan. The global epidemic of TB is fuelled by infection of HIV patients with TB and rise of multi-drug resistant TB strains<br><br>
WO 2008/068268		PCT/EP2007/063314<br>
(MDR-TB). The reactivation of latent TB is a high risk factor for disease development and accounts for 32% deaths in HIV infected individuals. To control TB epidemic, the need is to discover new drugs that can kill dormant or latent bacilli. The dormant TB can get reactivated to cause disease by several factors like suppression of host 5     immunity by use of immunosuppressive agents like antibodies against tumor necrosis factor a or interferon-^. In case of HIV positive patients the only prophylactic treatment available for latent TB is two- three months regimens of rifampicin, pyrazinamide.   The efficacy of the treatment regime is still not clear and furthermore the length of the treatments is an important constrain in resource-limited environments.<br>
10     Hence there is a drastic need to identify new drugs, which can act as chemoprophylatic agents for individuals harboring latent TB bacilli.<br>
The tubercle bacilli enter healthy individuals by inhalation; they are phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages of the lungs. This leads to potent immune response and formation of granulomas, which consist of macrophages infected with M, tuberculosis<br>
15     surrounded by T cells. After a period of 6-8 weeks the host immune response cause death of infected cells by necrosis and accumulation of caseous material with certain extracellular bacilli, surrounded by macrophages, epitheloid cells and layers of lymphoid tissue at the periphery. In case of healthy individuals, most of the mycobacteria are killed in these environments but a small proportion of bacilli still<br>
20     survive and are thought to exist in a non-replicating, hypometabolic state and are tolerant to killing by anti-TB drugs like isoniazid. These bacilli can remain in the altered physiological environments even for individual's lifetime without showing any clinical symptoms of disease. However, in 10% of the cases these latent bacilli may reactivate to cause disease. One of the hypothesis about development of these<br>
25     persistent bacteria is patho-physiological environment in human lesions namely,<br>
reduced oxygen tension, nutrient limitation, and acidic pH. These factors have been postulated to render these bacteria phenotypically tolerant to major anti-mycobacterial drugs.<br>
30     In addition to the management of the TB epidemic, there is the emerging problem of resistance to first-line antibiotic agents. Some important examples include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multi-resistant salmonellae.<br>
35     The consequences of resistance to antibiotic agents are severe. Infections caused by<br>
resistant microbes fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Treatment failures also lead to longer periods ofinfectivity, which<br><br>
WO 2008/068268<br><br><br><br>
PGT/EP2007/063314<br><br>
increase the numbers of infected people moving in the community and thus exposing the general population to the risk of contracting a resistant strain infection. Hospitals are a critical component of the antimicrobial resistance problem worldwide. The combination of highly susceptible patients, intensive and prolonged antimicrobial 5     use, and cross-infection has resulted in infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens.<br>
Self-medication with antimicrobials is another major factor contributing to resistance. Self-medicated antimicrobials may be unnecessary, are often inadequately dosed, or 10     may not contain adequate amounts of active drug.<br>
Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Patients forget to take medication, interrupt their treatment when they begin to feel better, or may be unable to afford a full course, thereby creating an ideal environment for 15     microbes to adapt rather than be killed.<br>
Because of the emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics, physicians are confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy. The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections impose an increasing burden for health care systems 20     worldwide.<br>
Therefore, there is a high need for new compounds to treat bacterial infections, especially mycobacterial infections including drug resistant and latent mycobacterial infections, and also other bacterial infections especially those caused by resistant 25     bacterial strains.<br>
WO2004/011436, WO2005/070924, WO2005/070430 and WO2005/075428 disclose certain substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against Mycobacteria, in particular against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. WO2005/117875 describes substituted<br>
30     quinoline derivatives having activity against resistant Mycobacterial strains.<br>
WO2006/067048 describes substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against latent tuberculosis. One particular compound of these substituted quinoline derivatives is described in Science (2005), 307, 223-227 and its mode of action is described in WO2006/035051.<br>
35<br>
Other substituted quinolines are disclosed in US-5,965,572 (The United States of America) for treating antibiotic resistant infections and in WO00/34265 to inhibit the<br><br>

growth of bacterial microorganisms.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, in particular substituted quinoline derivatives, having the property of inhibiting bacterial growth especially of Streptococci, Staphylococci or mycobacteria and therefore useful for the treatment of bacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the latent disease and including drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains), M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium and M. marinum.<br>

Whenever used herein, the term "compounds of formula (la) or (lb)" or "compounds according to the invention" is meant to also include their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts or their TV-oxide forms.<br>
15<br>
The compounds of formula (la) and (lb) are interrelated in that e.g. a compound according to formula (lb), with R9 equal to oxo and R8 equal to hydrogen, is the tautomeric equivalent of a compound according to formula (la) with R2 equal to hydroxy (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
20<br>
In the definition of Het, it is meant to include all the possible isomeric forms of the heterocycles, for instance, pyrrolyl comprises l//-pyrrolyl and 2/f-pyrrolyl.<br>
The aryl, aryl1 or Het listed in the definitions of the substituents of the compounds of 25     formula (la) or (lb) (see for instance R3) as mentioned hereinbefore or hereinafter may be attached to the remainder of the mo lecule of formula (la) or (lb) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate, if not otherwise specified. Thus, for example, when Het is imidazolyl, it may be 1-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl and the like.<br>
30<br>
Lines drawn from substituents into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.<br>
The pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts as mentioned hereinbefore or hereinafter are 35     meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds according to formula (la) or formula (lb) are able to form. Said acid<br><br>
WO 2008/068268<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063314<br><br>
addition salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to formula (la) or formula (lb) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; organic acids, for example acetic acid, 5     hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
10     The compounds of formula (la) or (lb) containing acidic protons may be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts as mentioned hereinbefore or hereinafter are meant to also comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms (base addition salt forms) which the<br>
15     compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are able to form. Appropriate base addition salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine<br>
20     isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-H-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, Af-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example,<br>
25     arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
Conversely, said acid or base addition salt forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
30     The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt also comprises the quaternary ammonium salts (quaternary amines) which the compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (Ta) or (lb) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted Ci^alkylhalide, arylCi-6alkylhalide, Ci^alkylcarbonylhalide, arylcarbonylhalide,<br>
35     HetCualkylhalide or Hetcarbonylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide.<br>
Preferably, Het represents a monocyclic heterocycle selected from furanyl or thienyl; or a bicyclic heterocycle selected from benzofuranyl or benzothienyl; each monocyclic<br><br>
WO 2008/068268		PCT/EP2007/063314<br>
and bicyclic heterocycle may optionally be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents, each substituent independently selected from the group of halo, alkyl and aryl. Preferably, the quatemizing agent is Ci-6alkylhalide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as Chalky! trifluoromethanesulfonates, Chalky! 5     methanesulfonates, and Cj^alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate, acetate, triflate, sulfate, sulfonate. Preferably, the counterion is iodo. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins. 10<br>
The term solvate comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms which the compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are able to form, as well as the salts thereof. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
15     In the framework of this application, a compound according to the invention is<br>
inherently intended to comprise all stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines allthe possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (la) and (lb), and their JV-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or physiologically functional derivatives<br>
20     may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms. In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or transÂ¬configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z<br>
25     (zusammen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (la) and (lb) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention. Of special interest are those compounds of formula (la) or (lb) which are<br>
30     stereochemically pure.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the 35     reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R* ] or [R*fS*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and [R *tjR *] indicates centers with the same chirality and [R *,5*] indicates<br><br>
WO 2008/068268		PCT/EP2007/063314<br>
centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R*t S*]. If "a" and "p" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring 5     number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "p", if it is on the other side of the mean plane 10     determined by the ring system.<br>
When a specific stereoisomeric form is indicated, this means that said form is substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50 %, preferably less than 20 %, more preferably less than 10 %, even more preferably less than 5 %, further preferably less 15     than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomers). Thus, when a<br>
compound of formula (la) or (lb) is for instance specified as (R,S), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (S,R) isomer.<br>
Compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) and some of the intermediate compounds 20     invariably have at least two stereogenic centers in their structure which may lead to at least 4 stereochemically different structures.<br>
The compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) may be synthesized in the foim of mixtures, in particular racemic mixtures, of enantiomers which can be separated from<br>
25     one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the<br>
30     enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will<br>
35     be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br><br>

Therefore resazurin (0.6 mg/ml) was added in a volume of 20 ul to all wells 3 hours after inoculation, and the plates were re-incubated overnight. A change in colour from blue to pink indicated the growth of bacteria. The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor<br>

Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds may be determined in a time kill assay using the broth microdilution method *. In a time kill assay on 35     Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the starting inoculum of S. aurues and MRSA is 106 CFU / ml in Muller Hinton broth.

The plates containing the microorganism and the test compounds are incubated at 37 Â°C. After 0, 4, 24, and 48 hrs of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10"' to 10"6) in sterile 5     PBS and plating (200 |il) on Mueller Hinton agar. The plates are incubated at 37 Â°C for 24 hrs and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by plotting the logjoCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of'CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The potential carryover effect of the drugs is removed by serial dilutions and counting the 10     colonies at highest dilution us.ed for plating.<br>
