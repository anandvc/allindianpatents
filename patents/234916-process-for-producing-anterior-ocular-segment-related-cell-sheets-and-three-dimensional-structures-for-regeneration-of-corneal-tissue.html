ANTERIOR OCULAR SEGMENT RELATED CELL SHEETS,<br>
THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES, AND PROCESSES<br>
FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to anterior ocular segment<br>
related cell sheets and three-dimensional structures in<br>
biology, medicine and other fields, as well as processes<br>
for producing such sheets, and therapeutic methods using<br>
them.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
With marked advances in medical technology, it has<br>
recently become popular to perform organ transplants, i.e.,<br>
replacing a difficult-to-treat organ with another person's<br>
organ. The organs that can be transplanted are quite<br>
diverse and include the skin, cornea, kidney, liver and<br>
heart, and in addition, the postoperative progress of organ<br>
transplants has improved so remarkably that they are<br>
already becoming established as a medical procedure.<br>
Keratoplasty is one example and as early as 40 years ago,<br>
an eye bank was organized in Japan to start transplanting<br>
activities. However, as of today, the number of donors in<br>
Japan is very small and notwithstanding the fact that there<br>
are annually about 20,000 patients who need keratoplasty,<br>
only a tenth of them (ca. 2,000 in number) can actually be<br>
treated by that procedure. Although keratoplasty is a<br>
virtually established procedure, it suffers the problem of<br>
shortage in donors, giving rise to the need for the<br>
development of a next-generation medical procedure.<br>
With this background, attention has been drawn to the<br>
procedure of directly transplanting artificial substitutes<br>
or cells that were cultured into assembly. Typical<br>
examples of this approach are the artificial skin and the<br>
cultured skin. However, the artificial skin using<br>
synthetic polymers has the potential to cause rejection and<br>
other side effects that make it undesirable as skin grafts.<br>
On the other hand, the cultured skin is prepared by<br>
cultivating a portion of the normal skin of the patient<br>
until it grows to a desired size, so it can be used without<br>
the risk of causing rejection and any other side effects<br>
and may well be described as the most natural masking<br>
agent.<br>
Conventionally, such cell culture has been performed<br>
either on the surface of glass or on the surface of<br>
synthetic polymers that were subjected to a variety of<br>
treatments. For example, a variety of polystyrene vessels<br>
that were subjected to surface treatments such as y~ray<br>
irradiation and silicone coating have become popular for<br>
use in cell culture. Cells that have been cultivated to<br>
grow on those vessels for cell culture are detached and<br>
recovered from the surfaces of the vessels by treatment<br>
with proteinases such as trypsin or chemical reagents.<br>
However, it has been pointed out that the recovery of<br>
grown cells by treatment with chemical reagents involves<br>
some disadvantages such as the processing steps becoming<br>
cumbersome to increase the chance of contamination by<br>
impurities and the grown cells becoming denatured or<br>
damaged by the chemical treatment to have their inherent<br>
functions injured. In order to overcome these<br>
disadvantages, several techniques have been proposed to<br>
date .<br>
JP 2-23191 B describes a method for producing a<br>
transplantable membrane of keratin tissue which comprises<br>
the steps of cultivating human neonatal keratinized<br>
epidermic cells in a culture vessel under conditions that<br>
enable a membrane of keratin tissue to form on the surface<br>
of the vessel and detaching the membrane of keratin tissue<br>
using an enzyme. Specifically, with 3T3 cells used as a<br>
feeder layer, the epidermic cells are grown and stratified<br>
as a cell sheet which is recovered using the proteinase<br>
dispase. However, the method described in JP 2-23191 B has<br>
had the following defects.<br>
(1) Dispase is of microbial origin and the recovered cell<br>
sheet needs to be washed thoroughly.<br>
(2) The conditions for dispase treatment differ from one<br>
batch of cell culture to another and great skill is<br>
required in the treatment.<br>
(3) The cultured epidermic cells are pathologically<br>
activated by dispase treatment.<br>
(4) The extracellular matrix is decomposed by dispase<br>
treatment.<br>
(5) As the result, the diseased site to which the cell<br>
sheet has been grafted is prone to infection.<br>
However, anterior ocular segment related cells that<br>
are contemplated in the present invention, such as corneal<br>
epithelial cells, corneal endothelial cells and<br>
conjunctival epithelial cells, do not have as strong<br>
intercellular binding as dermal cells and it has been<br>
impossible to detach and recover cultivated cells as a<br>
single sheet even if the dispase is employed.<br>
In order to solve this problem, a technique has<br>
recently been devised, according to which corneal<br>
epithelial cells or conjunctival epithelial cells are<br>
cultured into assembly on an amnion deprived of the spongy<br>
layer and the epithelial layer and the assembly is used as<br>
a cell graft together with the amnion (JP 2001-161353 A).<br>
Since the amnion has adequate strength as a membrane but<br>
has no antigenicity, it is favorable as a support of cell<br>
grafts; however, the amnion is not inherently in the eye<br>
and in order to construct a more precise intraocular<br>
tissue, it has been desired that a satisfactorily strong<br>
sheet be prepared solely from the intraocular cells.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished with a<br>
view to solving the aforementioned problems of the prior<br>
art. Therefore, the present invention has as an object<br>
providing an anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or<br>
a three-dimensional structure that have only a few<br>
structural defects as they have been recovered retaining<br>
the intercellular desmosome structure and the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate. Another<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a process by<br>
which cultivated and grown cells can be detached and<br>
recovered from a substrate's surface easily and as a<br>
satisfactorily strong, single sheet by changing the ambient<br>
temperature without treatment with an enzyme such as<br>
dispase.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to attain the stated objects, the present<br>
inventors engaged in R&amp;D activities taking various angles<br>
of study. As a result, the inventors found that an<br>
anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure having fewer structural defects could<br>
be obtained by a process comprising the steps of<br>
cultivating anterior ocular segment related cells on a cell<br>
culture support comprising a substrate having its surface<br>
covered with a temperature responsive polymer, optionally<br>
stratifying the layer of cultured cells, thereafter<br>
adjusting the temperature of the culture solution to either<br>
above an upper critical dissolution temperature or below a<br>
lower critical dissolution temperature, bringing the<br>
cultured anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or<br>
three-dimensional structure into close contact with a<br>
polymer membrane, and detaching the sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure together with the polymer membrane.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of<br>
this finding.<br>
Thus, the present invention first provides an<br>
anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure that have only a few structural<br>
defects as they have been recovered retaining the<br>
intercellular desmosome structure and the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for<br>
producing an anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or<br>
three-dimensional structure, comprising the steps of<br>
cultivating cells on a cell culture support comprising a<br>
substrate having its surface covered with a temperature<br>
responsive polymer having an upper or lower critical<br>
dissolution temperature of 0-80°C with respect to water,<br>
optionally stratifying the layer of cultured cells by the<br>
usual method, and thereafter,<br>
(1) adjusting the temperature of the culture solution to<br>
either above the upper critical dissolution temperature or<br>
below the lower critical dissolution temperature,<br>
(2) bringing the cultured anterior ocular segment related<br>
cell sheet or three-dimensional structure into-close<br>
contact with polymer membrane, and<br>
(3) detaching the sheet or three-dimensional structure<br>
together with the polymer membrane.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a process<br>
for producing a three-dimensional structure by stratifying<br>
the anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure in close contact with polymer<br>
membrane as obtained by the process described in the<br>
foregoing paragraph, the stratification being effected by<br>
repeating the sequence of the steps of attaching said<br>
anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure to a cell culture support, with or<br>
without being covered on a surface with a temperature<br>
responsive polymer, a polymer membrane, another cell sheet,<br>
or the like, and thereafter stripping the polymer membrane<br>
out of close contact.<br>
Further in addition, the present invention provides<br>
the above-described anterior ocular segment related cell<br>
sheet or three-dimensional structure for the treatment of a<br>
tissue that has become deficient and/or wounded to a deeper<br>
area .<br>
Still further in addition, the present invention<br>
provides a method of treatment characterized in that the<br>
above-described anterior ocular segment related cell sheet<br>
or three-dimensional structure is grafted to a tissue that<br>
has become deficient and/or wounded to a deeper area.<br>
Still further, the present invention provides an<br>
anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure that are useful not only in the<br>
medical field but also as cells for safety assessment of<br>
chemical substances, poisons or medicines.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Cells that can suitably be used in the preparation of<br>
the anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure of the present invention include<br>
corneal epithelial cells, corneal endothelial cells,<br>
conjunctival epithelial cells, and epithelial stem cells<br>
but the applicable cells are by no limited in type. In the<br>
present invention, the anterior ocular segment related cell<br>
sheet means a sheet obtained by cultivating a single layer<br>
of the above-described various kinds of anterior ocular<br>
segment forming cells in the living body on a culture<br>
support and thereafter detaching the layer from the<br>
support; the three-dimensional structure means a sheet that<br>
is obtained by stratifying the above-described sheet of<br>
various cultured epithelial cells, either on its own or in<br>
combination with a sheet or sheets of other cells.<br>
The anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or<br>
three-dimensional structure in the present invention is<br>
such that they have not been damaged during cultivation by<br>
proteinases typified by dispase and trypsin. Therefore,<br>
the anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or threedimensional<br>
structure as detached from the substrate<br>
retains the intercellular desmosome structure, has only a<br>
few structural defects, and features high strength. This<br>
means that if the obtained anterior ocular segment related<br>
cell sheet or three-dimensional structure is applied for<br>
such purposes as grafting, the anterior ocular segment<br>
related cell sheet or three-dimensional structure of the<br>
present invention having sufficient strength helps the<br>
diseased site to be completely isolated from the outside.<br>
In addition, the sheet of the present invention is<br>
characterized in that the basement membrane-like protein<br>
formed between cell and substrate during cultivation has<br>
not been destroyed by enzyme. Hence, the sheet can attach<br>
satisfactorily to the living tissue of the diseased site to<br>
which it has been grafted and this enables an efficient<br>
treatment to be performed. This is described below more<br>
specifically. If an ordinary proteinase such as trypsin is<br>
employed, the intercellular desmosome structure and the<br>
basement membrane-like protein between cell and substrate<br>
are hardly retained and, hence, the cell sheet is detached<br>
with the cells separated into discrete masses. As for the<br>
proteinase dispase, it destroys almost all of the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate but the<br>
cell sheet can be detached with 10-60% of the intercellular<br>
desmosome structure being retained and yet the cell sheet<br>
obtained has only low strength. In contrast, the cell<br>
sheet of the present invention keeps at least 80% of each<br>
of the desmosome structure and the basement membrane-like<br>
protein intact, thus providing the various advantages<br>
described above.<br>
As described above, the anterior ocular segment<br>
related cell sheet or three-dimensional structure in the<br>
present invention is a cell sheet that retains both the<br>
intercellular desmosome structure and the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate and which<br>
still features high strength; it has not been possible at<br>
all to obtain it by the prior art.<br>
The temperature responsive polymer which is used to<br>
cover the substrate of the cell culture support is<br>
characterized by having an upper or lower critical<br>
dissolution temperature of 0°C - 80°C, more preferably 20°C<br>
- 50°C, in aqueous solution. If the upper or lower<br>
critical dissolution temperature exceeds 80°C, cells may<br>
die, which is not preferred. If the upper or lower<br>
critical dissolution temperature is below 0°C, the cell<br>
growth rate will generally drop by an extreme degree or<br>
cells will die, which also is not preferred.<br>
The temperature responsive polymer to be used in the<br>
present invention may be a homopolymer or a copolymer.<br>
Examples of such polymers include the polymers described in<br>
JP 2-211865 A. Specifically, they are obtained by homo- or<br>
copolymerization of the following monomers. Monomers that<br>
can be used include, for example, (meth)acrylamide<br>
compounds, N- (or N,N-di)alkylsubstituted (meth)acrylamide<br>
derivatives, and vinyl ether derivatives; in the case of<br>
copolymers, any two or more of those monomers may be used.<br>
In addition, those monomers may be copolymerized with other<br>
monomers, or polymers may be grafted together or<br>
copolymerized, or alternatively, mixtures of polymers and<br>
copolymers may be employed. If desired, the polymers may<br>
be crosslinked to the extent that will not impair their<br>
properties.<br>
The substrate that is to be covered with the<br>
temperature responsive polymer may be chosen from among the<br>
glass, modified glass, compounds such as polystyrene and<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate) , and all other substances that<br>
can generally be given shape, as exemplified by polymer<br>
compounds other than those compounds, and ceramics.<br>
The method of covering the support with the<br>
temperature responsive polymer is not limited in any<br>
particular way but one may follow the methods described in<br>
JP 2-211865 A. Specifically, the covering operation can be<br>
achieved by either subjecting the substrate and the abovementioned<br>
monomers or polymers to electron beam (EB)<br>
exposure, y-ray irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation,<br>
plasma treatment, corona treatment or organic<br>
polymerization reaction or by means of physical adsorption<br>
as effected by application of coating solutions or the<br>
kneading step.<br>
The support material shown in the present invention<br>
is characterized by having two regions, region A covered<br>
with the temperature responsive polymer, and the following<br>
region B on its surface:<br>
(1) a region covered with a polymer having less affinity<br>
for cells;<br>
(2) a region covered with a different amount of the<br>
temperature responsive polymer than in region A;<br>
(3) a region covered with a polymer responsive to a<br>
different temperature than in region A; or a combination of<br>
any two of regions (l)-(3) or a combination of the three.<br>
The method of preparing the support material is not<br>
limited at all as long as the final product has the abovementioned<br>
structures; to mention a few examples, they<br>
include (1) a method comprising the steps of first forming<br>
region B over the entire surface of the substrate and then<br>
superposing region A with the area masked which eventually<br>
serves as region B, or vice versa, (2) a method comprising<br>
the steps of covering the substrate with two layers of A<br>
and B and scraping either layer by an ultrasonic or<br>
scanning device, and (3) a method of offset printing the<br>
covering substances, which methods may be employed either<br>
alone or in combination.<br>
The morphology of the covered regions are not limited<br>
in any way and may include the following patterns as seen<br>
above: (1) a combination of lines and spaces, (2) polka<br>
dots, (3) a grid, or patterns made of other special shapes,<br>
or patterns of their mixtures. Considering the state of<br>
each intraocular tissue, the pattern of dots (2) is<br>
preferred.<br>
The size of the covered areas is not limited in any<br>
way but considering the size of each intraocular tissue and<br>
the possibility that a cultured anterior ocular segment<br>
related cell sheet or three-dimensional structure may<br>
shrink as they are detached from the support, the following<br>
can at least be said about a dotted pattern: if the cells<br>
within each dot are to be used, the dot diameter is<br>
generally no more than 5 cm, preferably no more than 3 cm,<br>
and more preferably 2 cm or less; if the cells outside each<br>
dot are to be used, the dot diameter is generally no more<br>
than 1 mm, preferably no more than 3 mm, and more<br>
preferably 5 mm or less.<br>
The coverage of the temperature responsive polymer is<br>
suitably in the range of 0.3-6.0 ng/cm2, preferably 0.5-3.5<br>
(j.g/cm2, more preferably 0.8-3.0 ng/cm2. If the coverage of<br>
the temperature responsive polymer is less than 0.2 |J,g/cm2,<br>
the cells on the polymer will not easily detach even if<br>
they are given a stimulus and the operating efficiency is<br>
considerably lowered, which is not preferred. If, on the<br>
other hand, the coverage of the temperature responsive<br>
polymer is greater than 6.0 ng/cm2, cells will not easily<br>
adhere to the covered area and adequate adhesion of the<br>
cells becomes difficult to achieve.<br>
The polymer having high affinity for cells as<br>
used in the present invention is not limited in any way as<br>
long as it is free from cell adherence; examples include<br>
hydrophilic polymers such as polyacrylamide, poly(dimethyl<br>
acrylamide), polyethylene glycol and celluloses, or highly<br>
hydrophobic polymers such as silicone polymers and<br>
fluoropolymers.<br>
In the present invention, cell cultivation is<br>
effected on the cell culture support (e.g. cell culture<br>
dish) that has been prepared in the manner described above.<br>
The temperature of the culture medium is not limited in any<br>
particular way, except that it depends on whether the<br>
aforementioned polymer the substrate's surface has been<br>
covered with has an upper critical dissolution temperature<br>
or a lower critical dissolution temperature; in the former<br>
case, the medium's temperature should not be higher than<br>
the upper critical dissolution temperature and, in the<br>
latter case, it should not be less than the lower critical<br>
dissolution temperature. It goes without saying that it is<br>
inappropriate to perform cultivation in a lower-temperature<br>
range where the cultured cells will not grow or in a<br>
higher-temperature range where the cultured cells will die.<br>
The culture conditions other than temperature may be as<br>
adopted in the usual method and are not limited in any<br>
particular way. For instance, the culture medium to be<br>
used may be one that is supplemented with serum such as<br>
known fetal calf serum (FCS); alternatively, it may be a<br>
serum-free medium.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the culture<br>
time may be set in accordance with the above-described<br>
method depending on the object of using the anterior ocular<br>
segment related cell sheet or three-dimensional structure.<br>
The cultured cells may be detached and recovered from the<br>
support material by first bringing the cultured anterior<br>
ocular segment related cell sheet or three-dimensional<br>
structure into close contact with the polymer membrane,<br>
then adjusting the temperature of the support material with<br>
adhering cells to either above the upper critical<br>
dissolution temperature of the overlying polymer on the<br>
support substrate or below its lower critical dissolution<br>
temperature, whereupon the cells can be detached together<br>
with the polymer membrane. Detachment of the anterior<br>
ocular segment related cell sheet or three-dimensional<br>
structure can be effected within the culture solution in<br>
which the cells have been cultivated or in other isotonic<br>
fluids, whichever is suitable depending on the object. The<br>
polymer membrane to be brought into close contact with the<br>
anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or three-<br>
dimensional structure may be exemplified by polyvinylidene<br>
difluoride (PVDF), polypropylene, polyethylene, celluloses,<br>
cellulose derivatives, chitin, chitosan, collagen,<br>
urethane, etc.<br>
The method of producing the three-dimensional<br>
structure in the present invention is not limited in any<br>
particular way but may be exemplified by a method in which<br>
generally known 3T3 cells are grown as a feeder layer to<br>
effect stratification, or a method in which the cultured<br>
epithelial cell sheet in close contact with the<br>
aforementioned polymer membrane is utilized to produce the<br>
three-dimensional structure. The following specific<br>
methods may be mentioned as examples.<br>
(1) The cell sheet in close contact with the polymer<br>
membrane is adhered to the cell culture support and,<br>
thereafter, the culture medium is added, whereby the<br>
polymer membrane is stripped from the cell sheet, to which<br>
another cell sheet in close contact with the polymer<br>
membrane is adhered, the process being repeated to form a<br>
stratified cell sheet.<br>
(2) The cell sheet in close contact with the polymer<br>
membrane is inverted and fixed on the cell culture support,<br>
with the polymer membrane side facing down, and another<br>
cell sheet is adhered to the first cell sheet and,<br>
thereafter, the culture medium is added, whereby the<br>
polymer membrane is stripped from the cell sheet, to which<br>
yet another cell sheet is adhered, the process being<br>
repeated to form a stratified cell sheet.<br>
 (3) Two cell sheets, each in close contact with the polymer<br>
membrane, are held together in such a way that they face<br>
each other in close contact.<br>
(4) A cell sheet in close contact with the polymer membrane<br>
is pressed against the diseased site of a living body so<br>
that it is adhered to the living tissue and, thereafter,<br>
the polymer membrane is stripped away and another cell<br>
sheet is superposed on the first cell sheet.<br>
The three-dimensional structure of the present<br>
invention need not necessarily be made of corneal<br>
epithelial cells. It is also possible to overlie the cell<br>
sheet or three-dimensional structure made of corneal<br>
epithelial cells with a corneal endothelial cell sheet<br>
and/or a conjunctival epithelial cell sheet that have been<br>
prepared by following the same procedure. This procedure<br>
is extremely effective for the purpose of creating a<br>
structure closer to anterior ocular segment tissues in the<br>
living body.<br>
In order to detach and recover the anterior ocular<br>
segment related cell sheet or three-dimensional structure<br>
with high yield, the cell culture support may be lightly<br>
tapped or rocked or the culture medium may be agitated with<br>
the aid of a pipette; these and other methods may be<br>
applied either independently or in combination. In<br>
addition, the cultured cells may optionally be washed with<br>
an isotonic fluid or the like so that they are detached for<br>
recovery.<br>
The anterior ocular segment related cell sheet or<br>
three-dimensional structure obtained by the process<br>
described above far excels what are obtained by the prior<br>
art methods in terms of both easy detachment and high<br>
degree of non-invasiveness and have a great potential in<br>
clinical applications, as exemplified by corneal grafts.<br>
In particular, unlike the conventional graft sheets, the<br>
three-dimensional structure of anterior ocular segment<br>
related cells according to the present invention retains<br>
the basement membrane-like protein, so even if the diseased<br>
tissue to which it is going to be grafted is scraped by<br>
great thickness, the three-dimensional structure of the<br>
invention will take effectively. This contributes not only<br>
to improving the efficiency of treatment of the diseased<br>
site but also to reducing the burden on the patient, hence,<br>
it is anticipated to materialize as a very effective<br>
technique. Note that the cell culture support used in the<br>
process of the present invention allows for repeated use.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
On the following pages, the present invention is<br>
described in greater detail by reference to examples which<br>
are by no means intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Examples 1 and 2<br>
To a commercial polystyrene cell culture dish (FALCON<br>
3001 petri-dish with a diameter of 3.5 cm manufactured by<br>
Beckton Dickinson Labware), a coating solution having N-<br>
isopropylacrylamide monomer dissolved in isopropyl alcohol<br>
to give a concentration of 40% (Example 1) or 50% (Example<br>
2) was applied in a volume of 0.10 ml. Placed on the<br>
coated surface of the Petri-dish was a metallic mask having<br>
a diameter of 3.5 cm with a center hole having a diameter<br>
of 2 cm. While being kept in that state, the surface of<br>
the culture dish was exposed to electron beams with an<br>
intensity of 0.25 MGy, whereupon an N-isopropylacrylamide<br>
polymer (PIPAAm) was immobilized in a circular form (as an<br>
island, with the area under the mask being left as the sea<br>
which was covered with nothing since it was not exposed to<br>
electron beams). Then, the metallic mask was removed and a<br>
coating solution having N-isopropylacrylamide monomer<br>
dissolved in isopropyl alcohol to give a concentration of<br>
20% was applied in a volume of 0.10 ml. This time, a<br>
circular metallic mask having a diameter of 2 cm was placed<br>
just to cover the circular area. While being kept in that<br>
state, the culture dish was exposed to electron beams with<br>
an intensity of 0.25 MGy, whereupon an acrylamide polymer<br>
was immobilized outside the circular PIPAAm layer. After<br>
the irradiation, the metallic mask was removed and the<br>
culture dish was washed with ion-exchanged water to remove<br>
the residual monomer and the PIPAAm that did not bind to<br>
the culture dish; the culture dish was then dried in a<br>
clean bench and sterilized with an ethylene oxide gas to<br>
provide a cell culture support material. The coverage of<br>
PIPAAm in the island area was determined from a cell<br>
culture support material prepared under identical<br>
conditions to the above except that no mask was used. As<br>
the result, it was found that under the conditions<br>
employed, the substrate's surface was covered with the<br>
temperature responsive polymer in an amount of 1.6 |J.g/cm2<br>
(Example 1) or 2.2 |j,g/cm2 (Example 2). On the obtained<br>
cell culture support material, normal rabbit corneal<br>
epithelial cells were cultivated by the usual method<br>
(medium used: CORNEPAK (product of KURABO INDUSTRIES,<br>
LTD.); 37°C under 5% C02)  As it turned out, each of the<br>
cell culture support materials was such that the corneal<br>
epithelial cells adhered and grew normally in the central<br>
circular area. At day 14 of the culture, a 2 cm<br>
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was placed over<br>
the cultivated cells and the culture medium, as gently<br>
aspirated, was subjected to incubating and cooling at 20°C<br>
for 30 minutes together with the cell culture support<br>
material, whereupon the cells on each of the cell culture<br>
support materials were detached together with the overlying<br>
membrane. The overlying membrane could be easily stripped<br>
from each of the cell sheets. The cell sheets thus<br>
detached retained the intercellular desmosome structure and<br>
the basement membrane-like protein between cell and<br>
substrate and had adequate strength as a single sheet.<br>
In each of Examples 1 and 2, "low-temperature<br>
treatment" was performed by incubating at 20°C for 30<br>
minutes but the "low-temperature treatment" to be performed<br>
in the present invention is not limited to the aboveindicated<br>
temperature and time. The preferred temperature<br>
condition for the "low-temperature treatment" which is to<br>
be performed in the present invention is in the range of<br>
0°C - 30°C and the preferred treatment time is in the range<br>
from two minutes to an hour.<br>
Example 3<br>
By repeating the procedure of Example 1, normal<br>
rabbit corneal epithelial cells were cultivated on the same<br>
cell culture support, except that the medium was changed to<br>
the ordinary medium of Green et al. containing mitomycin C<br>
(DMEM+AB (for making a feeder layer); for human neonatal<br>
keratinized epithelial cells). As the result, the corneal<br>
epithelial cells on the cell culture support material<br>
adhered and grew normally in the central circular area, and<br>
the cell layer even stratified. At day 16 of the culture,<br>
the cells were incubated and cooled at 20°C for 30 minutes<br>
together with the cell culture support material, whereupon<br>
the stratified, corneal epithelial cell sheet was detached.<br>
The stratified corneal epithelial cell sheet (threedimensional<br>
structure) as detached was circular in shape<br>
and retained the intercellular desmosome structure and the<br>
basement membrane-like protein between cell and substrate<br>
to have adequate strength as a single sheet.<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2<br>
Cell culture support materials were prepared as in<br>
Example 1, except that the monomer solution for preparing<br>
the cell culture support in Example 1 was adjusted to 5%<br>
 (Comparative Example 1) or 60% (Comparative Example 2).<br>
The resulting coverage on the cell culture supports was<br>
respectively 0.1 |ig/cm2 (Comparative Example 1) and 6.2<br>
[ig/cm2 (Comparative Example 2). Thereafter, normal rabbit<br>
corneal epithelial cells were cultivated by the same<br>
procedure as Example 1 and an attempt was made to detach<br>
them. As it turned out, the cells on the support of<br>
Comparative Example 1 were difficult to detach even if they<br>
were given the low-temperature treatment; on the other<br>
hand, cells were difficult to adhere to the support of<br>
Comparative Example 2 and, hence, it was difficult to grow<br>
them satisfactorily. Thus, neither of the comparative cell<br>
culture supports was preferred as a cell substrate.<br>
Example 4<br>
Corneal endothelial cells were recovered from a<br>
rabbit's cornea by the usual method. The culture dish of<br>
Example 1 which had been grafted with polyisopropylamide<br>
(PIPAAm) was inoculated with those cells at a cell density<br>
of 2 x 106 cells/cm2 and cultivation was performed by the<br>
usual method (medium used: DMEM containing 10% fetal calf<br>
serum; 37°C under 5% C02) . Again, the corneal endothelial<br>
cells normally adhered and grew only in the central<br>
circular area. Ten days later, it was confirmed that the<br>
corneal endothelial cells had become confluent; thereafter,<br>
as in Example 1, a 2 cm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)<br>
membrane was placed over the cultivated cells and the<br>
culture medium, as gently aspirated, was subjected to<br>
incubating and cooling at 20°C for 30 minutes together with<br>
the cell culture support material, whereupon the cells were<br>
detached together with the overlying membrane. The<br>
overlying membrane could be easily stripped from the cell<br>
sheet. The cell sheet thus detached retained the<br>
intercellular desmosome structure and the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate and had<br>
adequate strength as a single sheet.<br>
Example 5<br>
The procedure of Example 2 for preparing a cell<br>
culture support material was repeated, except that a<br>
circular metallic mask having a diameter of 2 cm was put in<br>
the center of the culture dish, PIPAAm was immobilized<br>
around the mask, then a metallic mask with a center hole<br>
having a diameter of 2 cm was overlaid, thereby making a<br>
cell culture support material having the polyacrylamide<br>
immobilized in the central area (as in Example 1, except<br>
that the inner polymer layer was placed outside and the<br>
outer polymer layer, inside). The coverage of PIPAAm<br>
outside the hole was 2.1 (J,g/cm2. Subsequently, corneal<br>
endothelial cells were recovered from a rabbit's cornea by<br>
the usual method. The culture dish of Example 1 which had<br>
been grafted with polyisopropylamide (PIPAAm) was<br>
inoculated with those cells at a cell density of 2 x 106<br>
cells/cm2 and cultivation was performed by the usual method<br>
(medium used: DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum; 37°C<br>
under 5% 002) . Again, the corneal endothelial cells<br>
normally adhered and grew only in the central circular<br>
area. Ten days later, it was confirmed that the corneal<br>
endothelial cells had become confluent; thereafter, as in<br>
Example 1, a 2 cm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)<br>
membrane was placed over the cultivated cells and the<br>
culture medium, as gently aspirated, was subjected to<br>
incubating and cooling at 20°C for 30 minutes together with<br>
the cell culture support material, whereupon the cells were<br>
detached together with the overlying membrane. The -<br>
overlying membrane could be easily stripped from the cell<br>
sheet. The cell sheet thus detached retained the<br>
intercellular desmosome structure and the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate and had<br>
adequate strength as a single sheet.<br>
Example 6<br>
The corneal epithelial cell sheet on the culture dish<br>
of Example 2 from which the medium had been gently removed<br>
without cooling was immediately overlaid with the corneal<br>
epithelial cell sheet detached in Example 1. Thereafter,<br>
the culture medium used in Example 3 was gently placed to<br>
detach the polymer membrane out of close contact with the<br>
cell sheet. Kept this way, the cells were cultivated for<br>
2 days to make a stratified sheet (three-dimensional<br>
structure) of corneal epithelial cells. The stratified<br>
sheet of corneal epithelial cells was given the same lowtemperature<br>
treatment as in Example 3, whereupon it was<br>
detached from the surface of the support. The stratified<br>
sheet (three-dimensional structure) of corneal epithelial<br>
cells as detached had satisfactory strength as a single<br>
sheet.<br>
Example 7<br>
The corneal endothelial cell sheet on the culture<br>
dish of Example 4 from which the medium had been gently<br>
removed without cooling was immediately overlaid with the<br>
stratified sheet of corneal epithelial cells that was<br>
detached in Example 3. Thereafter, the culture medium used<br>
in Example 3 was gently placed to detach the polymer<br>
membrane out of close contact with the cell sheet. Kept<br>
this way, the cells were cultivated for 2 days to make a<br>
stratified sheet (three-dimensional structure) of corneal<br>
epithelial cells having the corneal endothelial cell layer.<br>
The stratified sheet of corneal epithelial cells was given<br>
the same low-temperature treatment as in Example 3,<br>
whereupon it was detached from the surface of the support.<br>
The detached three-dimensional structure, retaining the<br>
intercellular desmosome structure and the basement<br>
membrane-like protein between cell and substrate, had<br>
satisfactory strength as a single sheet.<br>
Example 8<br>
The corneal endothelial cell sheet on the culture<br>
dish of Example 4 from which the medium had been gently<br>
removed without cooling was fed with a 5% IV type,<br>
dissolved collagen containing medium (the same as the<br>
medium used in Example 4, except that it contained<br>
collagen) and left to stand as such for 20 minutes.<br>
Thereafter, the medium was again gently removed without<br>
cooling. The remaining corneal endothelial cell sheet on<br>
the culture dish was immediately overlaid with the<br>
stratified sheet of corneal epithelial cells that was<br>
detached in Example 3. Thereafter, the culture medium used<br>
in Example 3 was gently placed to detach the polymer<br>
membrane out of close contact with the cell sheet. Kept<br>
this way, the cells were cultivated for 2 days to make a<br>
stratified sheet (three-dimensional structure) of corneal<br>
epithelial cells having the corneal endothelial cell layer.<br>
The stratified sheet of corneal epithelial cells was given<br>
the same low-temperature treatment as in Example 3,<br>
whereupon it was detached from the surface of the support.<br>
The detached three-dimensional structure had satisfactory<br>
strength as a single sheet.<br>
Example 9<br>
The perforated, conjunctival epithelial cell sheet on<br>
the culture dish of Example 5 from which the medium had<br>
been gently removed without cooling was immediately<br>
overlaid partly with the stratified sheet (threedimensional<br>
structure) of corneal epithelial cells having<br>
the corneal endothelial cell layer that was detached in<br>
Example 7. Thereafter, the culture medium used in Example<br>
3 was gently placed to detach the polymer membrane out of<br>
close contact with the cell sheet. Kept this way, the<br>
cells were cultivated for 2 days to make a stratified sheet<br>
(three-dimensional structure) of corneal epithelial cells<br>
having the corneal endothelial cell layer to which the<br>
conjunctival epithelial cell sheet had adhered. The<br>
obtained three-dimensional structure was given the same<br>
low-temperature treatment as in Example 3, whereupon it was<br>
detached from the surface of the support. The detached<br>
three-dimensional structure had satisfactory strength as a<br>
single sheet.<br>
Example 10<br>
The stratified sheet (three-dimensional structure) of<br>
corneal epithelial cells obtained in Example 3 was grafted<br>
to a rabbit deficient of a corneal epithelial cell portion<br>
in accordance with the usual method. After grafting, the<br>
stratified sheet of corneal epithelial cells was sutured to<br>
the wound site. About 3 weeks later, the suture was<br>
removed and the stratified sheet of corneal epithelial<br>
cells had took well on the eyeball.<br>
From the foregoing results, it became clear that<br>
using the procedure of the present invention, one can<br>
fabricate satisfactorily strong sheets solely from<br>
intraocular cells. This is believed to provide a very<br>
effective technique for reducing the burden on patients by<br>
making the treatment protocol more efficient, and for<br>
constructing even more precise tissues.<br>
