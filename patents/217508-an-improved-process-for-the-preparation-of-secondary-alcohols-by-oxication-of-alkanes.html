				<td>Background of the information<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of secondary alcohols<br>
by oxidation of n-paraffms. The invention is particularly concerned with a process for the<br>
oxidation of n-paraffin in presence of boric acid, or boric acid esters, mixed with water,<br>
selectively, yields secondary alcohols.<br>
Fatty alcohols, having C12.C15 carbon chains and their derivatives are important<br>
commercial products as plasticizers, surfactants and in the production of polymers,<br>
monomers, lubricating oils. Viscosity improvers and pour point depressants greases etc.<br>
Fatty alcohol derivatives are used to a great extent in the premium house hold<br>
detergents for performance and environmental reasons. These surfactants are readily<br>
biodegradable and are finding increased use in low phosphate and non-phosphate<br>
detergents. The alcohol provides the starting material for all types of surfactants e.g.<br>
non-ionics anianics, catiaric and zwitterianics of Ci2-Cis find applications in consumer<br>
products e.g. Toothpaste, hair shampoos, carpet shampoos and light duty house hold<br>
detergent. Polyethoxyiates alcohols sulphates and neutralized products gives anionic<br>
surfactants had wide applications as light duty detergent and heavy duty house hold<br>
liquid &amp; granular detergent. Polyethoxylated alcohols have numerous industrial<br>
applications as wetting agents, dispersing agents and errfulsifiers.<br>
It is well known in the literature that these fatty alcohols can be produced directly via<br>
oxidation of n-paraffins. Studies to prepare fatty alcohols via oxidation of n-paraffins.<br>
Studies to prepare fatty alcohols via oxidation of n-paraffins in presence of boric acid<br>
*<br>
and arsenous acids, aluminium and chromic hydroxides and potassium permanganate<br>
are described in J. Soc. Chem. Ind. Jpn., 47, pp. 475-477, 1944; ibid-46, pp. 765-7,<br>
1943 and Ann. Chim. Appl., 39, pp. 311-20, 1949.<br>
In all the above investigations the alcohol formation is accompanied by the formation of<br>
large amount of by-products such as acids, esters and carboxyl compounds etc.,<br>
resulting in a complex mixture of oxygenated compound; the isolation of alcohols from<br>
such complex mixture is very difficult.<br>
Baskhirov et.al. and Baskirov and Kamzolkim (Proc. Acad. Sci. U.S.S.R. Chem. Tech.<br>
Sec., 1, pp 118-119, 1956 and World Pet. Congr. 4, pp. 175-183, 1959) described the<br>
process for oxidation of individual n-paraffins with nitrogen-oxygen mixture containing<br>
3.0 to 4.5% oxygen at 165 -170°C mixture containing 3.0 to 4.5% oxygen in liquid phase<br>
at 165-170°C in presence of boric acid or to produce secondary fatty alcohols with same •<br>
number of carbon atoms and the same skeletal structure of the starting paraffin. The<br>
yield of alcohols was reported to be about 70% of the n-paraffms feedstock.<br>
Various boron derivatives e.g. tributoxy boroxine, tributoxy borane, boron trioxide with or<br>
without lithium oxide have also been reported to be used in the oxidation of n-paraffin to<br>
alcohols. The yield of alcohols were however low in the range of 16-21% at 10-30%<br>
paraffin conversion.<br>
In US patent no. 3,238,238 (1966), use of oxidation catalysts such as Mg, Co or V<br>
napthenate, oleate or acetate with t-butylborate and an inert diluent oxidize aliphatic<br>
hydro-carbons to alcohols at 130-180°C.<br>
Japanese patent no 6,27,267 (1987) describes a process to prepare alcoholic waxes by<br>
liquid-phase oxidation of C2o-Ceo paraffins waxes with oxygen in presence of 1.0:0.5 -<br>
1.0 mol mixture of HaBQs and 8263; about 73% conversion to alcohols were reported.<br>
A process for preparing secondary alcohols by oxidation of Cio-C30 n-paraffins using<br>
finely divided orthoboric acid at 156-60°C has been claimed to given about 70%<br>
selectivity to alcohol formation. (Neth. Patent appl. 6, 50g857 (1966)).<br>
Use of promoters such as ammonia, amines, imides, amides, pyridine etc. were found<br>
to promote the oxidation of alkanes or cycloalkane with boric acid or dehydrate boric<br>
acid (French patent no- 1,501,429 (1967)).<br>
US patent no 4,970,346 (1990) disclose a process for the production of detergent range<br>
alcohols and ketones from Ci0-C18 alkanes by reacting with a hydroperoxide in the<br>
presence of dicyano bis (1,10 = phenanthrolene) iron (II) catalyst.<br>
The use of transition metal catalysts to prepare C10-Ci8 alcohols have been described in<br>
US patent no's-4,978,800 (1990) and 4,978,799 (1990); the conversion to alcohols<br>
obtained were low (~ 2% wt) even at longer reaction time of 20 h.<br>
The oxidation of alkanes in presence of boric acid or esters to produce alcohols was<br>
claimed to be accelerated by use of 50-100.ppm transition metal as a 3d-carboxylate.<br>
(Brit. Patent no- 1,035,624 (1966)).<br>
Various oxidation catalysts were reported in literature including Mn-Naphthenate<br>
Mn02KMnO4 t-Butyl per oxide, Co-strearate, TiCU, etc. to increase the yield of Borate<br>
ester. Amine &amp; NH3 were used to reduce the deactivation effect of aromatics.<br>
Use of additives such as boron trioxide, tributyl oxyboroxine, oxybis (di-n-butoxy<br>
borane) and t-butyl hydroperoxide is known to increase the formation of alcohols but<br>
only marginally. In the hitherto known processes, generally the yield of alcohols and<br>
conversion of n-paraffins perpass range between 16-21% and 10-30% respectively. The<br>
selectivity of alcohols and ketones combined together range between 80-90% based on<br>
paraffin. Further in these processes there is always a possibility of coagulation of boric<br>
acid or boric acid esters due to their poor solubility and density difference between boric<br>
acid and hydrocarbon phase. This leads to poor activity of boric acid and decrease the<br>
yield of alcohols.<br>
The main object of the present invention to provide improved process for the oxidation<br>
of paraffins. It is an object of the present invention to provide a procer.s in which the<br>
boric acid as solution in water is used to improve the yield of secondary alcohols in the<br>
oxidation of paraffins.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that boric acid solution in<br>
water improves the selectivities and yield of secondary alcohols when used to produce<br>
secondary alcohols via oxidation of n-paraffms.<br>
During the investigation related to the research of using boric acid solution and<br>
developing a process for the oxidation of n-alkanes the inventors of the present<br>
invention found that when boric acid is used as solution in water, it improves dispersion<br>
of boric acid in the reaction mixture. Since the oxidation reaction is performed at<br>
relatively higher temperature than the boiling point of water, the water present in the<br>
system is converted into water vapour which provides increased mixing and dispersion ,<br>
of boric acid. Further reprecipitation of boric acid from the boiling solution converts boric<br>
acid into very small particles thus improves the available surface area of contact with nalkanes<br>
per oxides producing alcohols at a faster rate.<br>
The reaction was carried out in cylindrical glass reactor having a thermometer pocket, a<br>
sintered disc at the bottom to bubble the N2 + O2 mixture. The reactor was connected to<br>
a reflex condenser through Dean and Stark receiver-to remove water. Out let gases<br>
were passed though a gas meter. The reactor can be heated electrically from the<br>
outside. The paraffin feed is taken in the reactor while N2 + O2 mixture of known<br>
concentration is bubbled through the paraffin at a required rate. The contents of the<br>
reactor is heated to the desired temperature for a specified and then boric acid water<br>
i<br>
solution is added to it. The reaction is continued for same. The water formed in the<br>
reaction or water added is removed with the help of liquid separator. After the reaction is<br>
over product is cooled and taken out in a RB flask. The unreacted paraffin is removed<br>
under reduced pressure to the extent possible. The extent &amp; yield of the alcohols were<br>
monitored in terms of the yield of Borate ester which was worked up usual work<br>
procedure as given below:<br>
The borate ester left as residue is hydrolysed with equal quality of water at reflux<br>
temperature. The aqueous layer is evaporated to get boric acid. The organic portion is<br>
digested with alkali to remove organic acid which can be recovered by neutralization of<br>
aqueous portion.<br>
The organic portion is again distilled to recover the secondary alcohols.<br>
According to the specific feature of the present invention, there is provided an improved<br>
process for the preparation of secondary alcohols which comprises:<br>
(a) Contacting n-alkanes having 10-20 carbon atom with boric acid water solution.<br>
(b) Contacting the resulting mixture with air, 02 or oxygen containing inert gas such as<br>
N2 at a temperature in the range of 150-250°C and at a pressure of atmospheric to<br>
10 bar for a period in the range of 1-10 h at a space velocity of CVnitrogen mixture<br>
of1-200h'1.<br>
(c) Separating the unreacted n-alkanes, secondary alcohol borate esters and unreacted<br>
boric acid by distillation.<br>
(d) Recovering the secondary alcohols by hydrolysis of borate esters; and<br>
(e) Recycling, if desired the n-alkanes and boric acid in step (a) and (b).<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of<br>
secondary alcohols which comprises of contacting n-alkanes with air, nitrogen &amp; 02<br>
mixture in presence of aqueous boric acid, which provides higher selectivity of<br>
secondary alcohols.<br>
The invention has been described in conjunction with examples and by reference to the<br>
.embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations<br>
will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description,<br>
accordingly it is intended in the invention to embrace these and all such alternatives,<br>
variations, aid modifications as may fall within the spirit and scope of the appended<br>
claims:<br>

glass reactor with a reflux condenser at the top and heated electrically from outside and<br>
have a sintered disc at the bottom to bubble the oxygen, nitrogen mixture. The O2/N2<br>
mixture was fed at a rate of 41 lit/hr. The temperature of the paraffin was increased to<br>
155°C in 1 hr. The reaction was continued for 270 minutes.<br>
After the reaction was out reacted paraffin was removed by distillation under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was hydrolysed by boiling with water to decompose the borate<br>
esters of sec-alcohol. The organic layer thus obtained was treated with alkali to remain<br>
traces of boric acid and other acids. The organic product was distilled to attain secalcohol.<br>
The yield of the sec-alcohol was only 0.26%.<br>
Example-2<br>
The experiment was carried out as described in example-1 except that the paraffinic<br>
mixture was having n-paraffine for C10-15 and the reaction temperature was 180°C<br>
instead of 1552°C. The yield of the alcohols after usual workup was 15.5%.<br>
Example -3<br>
The experiment was carried out as described in example-2 except that a feed of C10-<br>
C14 was taken instead of C11-C15 and two lots of 3g boric acid in 25 ml paraffine<br>
mixture were added in 10 min time after attaining the reaction temperature respectively.<br>
Total reaction time was 150 minutes. The yield of sec-alcohol after workup was 14.5%.<br>
Example -4<br>
The experiment was carried out as example-2 except that 3g boric acid was added as<br>
solution in 100 ml water during 90 minutes and total reaction time was 180 minute. The<br>
yield of sec-alcohol after work up was 18.6%.<br>

recovered paraffin mixture was used. The CVNa mixture feed rate was 80 lit/hr and 6 g<br>
boric acid in 65 ml water was added in 40 min. The addition of boric acid was done ak<br>
the bottom of the reactor. Reaction time was 70 min. The yield of sec-alcohol was found<br>
to be 21.4%.<br>
Example-6<br>
The experiment was carried out as described in example 4 except that 200 g of<br>
paraffine mixture was used with catalyst A and O2/N2 mixture feed rate was 80 lit/hr.<br>
Two lots of 6 g each of boric acid were added as solution in 65 ml water. The boric acid<br>
