				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ASSEMBLING A PLURALITY OF RADIO<br>
FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TAGS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the assembly of electronic<br>
devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to the assembly of<br>
radio frequency identification (RFID) tags.<br>
Related Art<br>
Pick and place techniques are often used to assemble electronic<br>
devices. Such techniques involve a manipulator, such as a robot arm, to<br>
remove integrated circuit (IC) dies from a wafer and place them into a die<br>
carrier. The dies are subsequently mounted onto a substrate with other<br>
electronic components, such as antennas, capacitors, resistors, and inductors to<br>
form an electronic device.<br>
Pick and place techniques involve complex robotic components and<br>
control systems that handle only one die at a time. This has a drawback of<br>
limiting throughput volume. Furthermore, pick and place techniques have<br>
limited placement accuracy, and have a minimum die size requirement.<br>
One type of electronic device that may be assembled using pick and<br>
place techniques is an RFID "tag." An RFID tag may be affixed to an item<br>
whose presence is to be detected and'or monitored. The presence of an RFID<br>
tag, and therefore the presence of the item to which the tag is attixed, may be<br>
checked and monitored by devices known as "readers."<br>
As market demand increases for products such as RFID tags, and as<br>
die sizes shrink, high assembly throughput rates for very small die;, and low<br>
production costs are crucial in providing commercially-viable products.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a method and apparatus for high volume<br><br>
assembly of electronic devices, such as RFID tags, that overcomes these<br>
limitations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to methods, systems, and apparatuses<br>
for producing one or more electronic devices, such as RFID tags, that each<br>
include a die having one or more electrically conductive contact pads that<br>
provide electrical connections to related electronics on a substrate.<br>
In a first aspect, a plurality of RFID tags is assembled according to the<br>
present invention. A plurality of dies are separated from a scribed wafer and<br>
attached to a transfer or support surface (commonly referred to as a "green<br>
tape" in the industry). The dies are transferred from the support surface to<br>
corresponding tag substrates either directly or via one or more intermediate<br>
surfaces.<br>
In a first aspect, dies are transferred between surfaces using an<br>
adhesive surface mechanism and process.<br>
In another aspect, dies are transferred between surfaces using a<br>
punching mechanism and process.<br>
In another aspect, dies are transferred between surfaces using a multi-<br>
barrel die collet mechanism and process.<br>
In another aspect, a die frame is formed. Furthermore, dies are<br>
transferred using the die frame.<br>
In one aspect for making a die frame, a wafer that comprises a plurality<br>
of dies is attached to a surface of a tape structure. A grid of grooves is formed<br>
in the wafer to separate the plurality of dies on the surface of the tape<br>
structure. A portion of the tape structure that is accessible through the grooves<br>
of the grid is caused to harden into a grid shaped structure. The grid shaped<br>
structure removably holds the plurality of dies. One or more dies of the<br>
plurality of dies can be moved from the grid shaped structure onto a target<br>
surface.<br><br>
In another aspect for making a die frame, a wafer that comprises a<br>
plurality of dies is attached to a surface of a tape structure. The tape structure<br>
comprises an encapsulated hardening material. A grid of grooves is formed in<br>
the wafer to separate the plurality of dies on the surface of the tape structure.<br>
The surface of the tape structure is breached in the grooves while forming the<br>
grooves to cause the encapsulated hardening material to harden in the grooves<br>
into a grid shaped hardened material in the grooves of the grid.<br>
In an aspect, dies may be transferred from a die frame made according<br>
to the present invention. A die frame is positioned closely adjacent to a<br>
surface of a substrate such that a die of a plurality of dies removably held in<br>
the die frame is closely adjacent to the substrate. The die is transferred onto<br>
the closely adjacent substrate from the die frame. Each die may be transferred<br>
from the die frame to the closely adjacent surface in this manner. Dies may be<br>
transferred from the die frame one by one, or multiple dies may be transferred<br>
at a time.<br>
In one aspect, dies may be transferred between surfaces in a "pads up"<br>
orientation. When dies are transferred to a substrate in a "pads up"<br>
orientation, related electronics can be printed or otherwise formed to couple<br>
contact pads of the die to related electronics of the tag substrate.<br>
la an alternative aspect, the dies may be transferred between surfaces<br>
in a "pads down" orientation. When dies are transferred to a substrate in a<br>
"pads down" orientation, related electronics can be pre-printed or otherwise<br>
pre-deposited on the tag substrates.<br>
In another aspect, a system for forming a die frame is described. A<br>
wafer preparation module applies a wafer to a surface of a tape structure. The<br>
wafer preparation module forms a grid of grooves in the wafer to separate the<br>
plurality of dies on the surface of the tape structure. A hardening agent source<br>
causes a portion of the tape structure that is accessible through the grooves of<br>
the grid to harden into a grid shaped structure. The grid shaped structure<br>
removably holds the plurality of dies. One or more dies of the plurality of dies<br>
can be moved from the grid shaped structure onto a target surface.<br><br>
In still another aspect, another system for forming a die frame is<br>
described. A wafer preparation module applies a wafer to a surface of a tape<br>
structure. The wafer preparation module forms a grid of grooves in the wafer<br>
to separate the plurality of dies on the surface of the tape structure. The tape<br>
structure comprises an encapsulated hardening material. A wafer singulation<br>
module forms a grid of grooves in the wafer to separate the plurality of dies on<br>
the surface of the tape structure. The wafer singulatiorA module breaches the<br>
surface of the tape structure in the grooves when forming the grooves to cause<br>
the encapsulated hardening material to harden in the grooves into a grid<br>
shaped hardened material<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a system and apparatus<br>
enables the assembly of RFID tags. A die transfer module is present to<br>
transfer a plurality of dies from the support surface to the tag substrates in<br>
either a pads up or down manner<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, an alternative system and<br>
apparatus enables the assembly of RFID tags. A wafer preparation module is<br>
present to transfer the dies from the support surface to a transfer surface. A<br>
die transfer module transfers the dies from the transfer surface to the tag<br>
substrates in either a pads up or down manner.<br>
These and other advantages and features will become readily apparent<br>
in view of the following detailed description of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides improved processes and systems for<br>
assembling electronic devices, including REID tags. The present invention<br>
provides improvements over current processes. Conventional techniques<br>
include vision-based systems that pick and place dies one at a time onto<br>
substrates. The present invention can transfer multiple dies simultaneously.<br>
Vision-based systems are limited as far as the size of dies that may be handled,<br>
such as being limited to dies larger than 600 microns square. The present<br>
invention is applicable to dies 100 microns square and even smaller.<br>
Furthermore, yield is poor in conventional systems, where two or more dies<br>
maybe accidentally picked up at a time, causing losses of additional dies.<br>
The present invention provides an advantage of simplicity.<br>
Conventional die transfer tape mechanisms may be used by the present<br>
invention. Furthermore, much higher fabrication rates are possible. Current<br>
techniques process 5-8 thousand units per hour. The present invention can<br>
provide improvements in these rates by a factor of N. For example,<br>
embodiments of the present invention can process dies 5 times as fast as<br>
conventional techniques, at 100 times as fast as conventional techniques, and<br>
at even faster rates. Furthermore, because the present invention allows for<br>
flip-chip die attachment techniques, wire bonds are not necessary.<br>
Elements of the embodiments described herein may be combined in<br>
any manner. Example RFID tags are described in the section below.<br>
Assembly embodiments for RFID tags are described in the next section.<br>
Further processing processes are then described, followed by a description of<br>
tag assembly systems.<br><br>
1.0 RFID Tag<br>
The present invention is directed to techniques for producing electronic<br>
devices, such as RFID tags. For illustrative purposes, the description herein<br>
primarily relates to the production of RFID tags. However, the description is<br>
also adaptable to the production of further electronic device types, as would be<br>
understood by persons skilled in, the relevant art(s) from the teachings herein.<br>
FIG. 1A shows a block diagram of an exemplary RFID tag 100,<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1A,<br>
RFID tag 100 includes a die 104 and related electronics 1.06 located on a tag<br>
substrate 116. Related electronics 106 includes an antenna 114 in the present<br>
example. FIGS. 1B and 1C show detailed views of exemplary RFID tags 100,<br>
indicated as RFID tags 100a and 100b. As shown in FIGS. IB and 1C, die<br>
104 can be mounted onto antenna 114 of related electronics 106. As is further<br>
described elsewhere herein, die 104 may be mounted in either a pads up or<br>
pads down orientation.<br>
RFID tag 100 may be located in an area having a large number or pool<br>
of RFID tags present. RFID tag 100 receives interrogation signals transmitted<br>
by one or more tag readers. According to interrogation protocols, RFID tag<br>
100 responds to these signals. Each response includes information that<br>
identifies the corresponding RFID tag 100 of the potential, pool of RFID tags<br>
present. Upon reception of a response, the tag reader determines the identity<br>
of the responding tag, thereby ascertaining the existence of the tag within a<br>
coverage area defined by the tag reader.<br>
RFID tag 100 may be used in various applications, such as inventory<br>
control, airport baggage monitoring, as well as security and surveillance<br>
applications. Thus, RFID tag 100 can be affixed to items such as airline<br>
baggage, retail inventory, warehouse inventory, automobiles, compact discs<br>
(CDs), digital video disks (DVDs), video tapes, and other objects. RFID tag<br>
100 enables location monitoring and real time tracking of such items.<br>
In the present embodiment, die 104 is an integrated circuit that<br>
performs RFID operations, such as communicating with one or more tag<br><br>
readers (not shown) according to various interrogation protocols. Exemplary<br>
interrogation protocols are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,002,344 issued<br>
December 14, 1999 to Bandy et al. entitled System and. Method for Electronic<br>
Inventory, and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/072,885, filed on February 12,<br>
2002. Die 104 includes a plurality of contact pads that each provide an<br>
electrical connection with related electronics 106.<br>
Related electronics 106 are connected to die 104 through a plurality of<br>
contact pads of IC die 104. In embodiments, related electronics 106 provide<br>
one or more capabilities, including RF reception and transmission capabilities,<br>
sensor functionality, power reception and storage functionality, as well as<br>
additional capabilities. The components of related electronics 106 can be<br>
printed onto a tag substrate 116 with materials, such as conductive inks.<br>
Examples of conductive inks include silver conductors 5000, 5021, and 5025,<br>
produced by DuPont Electronic Materials of Research Triangle Park, N.C.<br>
Other materials or means suitable for printing related electronics 106 onto tag<br>
substrate 116 include polymeric dielectric composition 5018 and carbon-based<br>
PTC resistor paste 7282, which are also produced by DuPont Electronic<br>
Materials of Research Triangle Park, N.C. Other materials or means that may<br>
be used to deposit the component material onto the substrate would be<br>
apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) from the teachings herein.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1A-1C, tag substrate 116 has a first surface that<br>
accommodates die 104, related electronics 106, as well as further components<br>
of tag 100. Tag substrate 116 also has a second surface that is opposite the<br>
first surface. An adhesive material or backing can be included on the second<br>
surface. When present, the adhesive backing enables tag 100 to be attached to<br>
objects, such as books and consumer products. Tag substrate 116 is made<br>
from a material, such as polyester, paper, plastic, fabrics such as cloth, and/or<br>
other materials such as commercially available Tyvec®.<br>
In some implementations of tags 100, tag substrate 116 can include an<br>
indentation or "cell" (not shown in FIGS. 1A-1C) that accommodates die 104.<br><br>
An example of such an implementation is included in a "pads up" orientation<br>
of die 104, as is further described elsewhere herein.<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B show plan and side views of an example die 104.<br>
Die 104 includes four contact pads 204a-d that provide electrical connections<br>
between related electronics 106 and internal circuitry of die 104. Note that<br>
although four contact pads 204a-d are shown, any number of contact pads may<br>
be used, depending on a particular application. Contact pads 204 are made of<br>
an electrically conductive material during fabrication of the die. Contact pads<br>
204 can be further built up if required by the assembly process, by the<br>
depostion of additional and/or other materials, such as gold and solder flux.<br>
Such post processing, or "bumping," will be known to persons skilled in the<br>
relevant arts.<br>
FIG. 2C shows a portion of a substrate 116 with die 104 attached<br>
thereto, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. As<br>
shown in FIG. 2C, contact pads 204a-d of die 104 are coupled to respective<br>
contact areas 210a-d of substrate 116. Contact areas 210a-d provide electrical<br>
connections to related electronics 106. The arrangement of contact pads 204a-<br>
d in a rectangular shape allows for flexibility in attachment of die 104 to<br>
substrate 116, and good mechanical adherement. This arrangement allows for<br>
a range of tolerance for imperfect placement of IC die 104 on substrate 116,<br>
while still achieving acceptable electrical coupling between contact pads 204a-<br>
d and contact areas 210a-d. For example, FIG. 2D shows an imperfect<br>
placement of IC die 104 on substrate 116. However, even though IC die 104<br>
has been improperly placed, acceptable electrical coupling is achieved<br>
between contact pads 204a-d and contact areas 210a-d.<br>
Note that although FIGS. 2A-2D show the layout of four contact pads<br>
204a-d collectively forming a rectangular shape, greater or lesser numbers of<br>
contact pads 204 may be used. Furthermore, contact pads 204a-d may be laid<br>
out in other shapes in embodiments of the present invention.<br><br>
2.0 RFID Tag Assembly<br>
The present invention is directed to continuous-roll assembly<br>
techniques and other techniques for assembling tags, such as RFID tag 100.<br>
Such techniques involve a continuous web (or roll) of the material of the tag<br>
antenna substrate 116 that is capable of being separated into a plurality of tags.<br>
As described herein, the manufactured one or more tags can then be post<br>
processed for individual use. For illustrative purposes, the techniques<br>
described herein are made with reference to assembly of RFID tag 100.<br>
However, these techniques can be applied to other tag implementations and<br>
other suitable devices, as would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant<br>
art(s) from the teachings herein.<br>
The present invention advantageously eliminates the restriction of<br>
assembling electronic devices, such as RFID tags, one at a time, allowing<br>
multiple electronic devices to be assembled in parallel. The present invention<br>
provides a continuous-roll technique that is scalable and provides much higher<br>
throughput assembly rates than conventional pick and place techniques.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a flowchart 300 with example steps relating to<br>
continuous-roll production of RFID tags 100, according to example<br>
embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 3 shows a flowchart illustrating a<br>
process 300 for assembling tags 100. Process 300 begins with a step 302. In<br>
step 300, a wafer 400 having a plurality of dies 104 is produced. FIG. 4A<br>
illustrates a plan view of an exemplary wafer 400. As illustrated in FIG. 4A, a<br>
plurality of dies 104 are arranged in a plurality of rows 402a-n.<br>
In a step 304, wafer 400 is applied to a support surface 404. Support<br>
surface 404 includes an adhesive material to provide adhesiveness. For<br>
example support surface 404 may be an adhesive tape that holds wafer 400 in<br>
place for subsequent processing. FIG. 4B shows an example view of wafer<br>
400 in contact with an example support surface 404.<br>
In a step 306, the plurality of dies 104 on wafer 400 are separated. For<br>
example, step 306 may include scribing wafer 400 according to a process,<br>
such as laser etching. FIG. 5 shows a view of wafer 400 having example<br><br>
separated dies 104 that are in contact with support surface 404. FIG. 5 shows<br>
a plurality of scribe lines 502a-l that indicate locations where dies 104 are<br>
separated.<br>
In a step 308, the plurality of dies 104 are transferred from support<br>
surface 404 to tag substrate 116. In an embodiment, step 308 may allow for<br>
"pads down" transfer. Alternatively, step 308 may allow for "pads up"<br>
transfer. As used herein the terms "pads up" and "pads down" denote<br>
alternative implementations of tags 100. In particular, these terms designate<br>
the orientation of connection pads 204 in relation to tag substrate 116. In a<br>
"pads up" orientation for tag 100, die 104 is transferred to tag substrate 116<br>
with pads 204a-204d facing away from tag substrate 116. In a "pads down"<br>
orientation for tag 100, die 104 is transferred to tag substrate 116 with pads<br>
204a-204d facing towards, and in contact with tag substrate 116. An example<br>
of step 308 involving "pads up" transfer is described in greater detail herein<br>
with reference to FIG. 11. An example of step 308 involving "pads down"<br>
transfer is described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 16.<br>
In a step 310, post processing is performed. During step 310, assembly<br>
of RFID tag(s) 100 is completed. Step 310 is described in further detail below<br>
with reference to FIG. 54.<br>
2.1 Die Transfer Embodiments<br>
Step 308 shown in FIG. 3, and discussed above, relates to transferring<br>
separated dies from a support surface to a tag substrate. The separated dies<br>
that are attached to the support surface (e.g., as shown in FIG. 5) can be<br>
transferred to the tag substrate by a variety of techniques. Conventionally, the<br>
transfer is accomplished using a pick and place tool. The pick and place tool<br>
uses a vacuum die collet controlled by a robotic mechanism that picks up the<br>
die from the support structure by a suction action, and holds the die securely in<br>
the die collet. The pick and place tool deposits the die into a die carrier or<br>
transfer surface. For example, a suitable transfer surface is a "punch tape"<br>
manufactured by Mulbauer, Germany. A disadvantage of the present pick and<br><br>
place approach is that only one die at a time may be transferred. Hence, the<br>
present pick and place approach does not scale well for very high throughput<br>
rates.<br>
The present invention allows for the transfer of more than one die at a<br>
time from a support surface to a transfer surface. In fact, the present invention<br>
allows for the transfer of more than one die between any two surfaces,<br>
including transferring dies from a support surface to an intermediate surface,<br>
transferring dies between multiple intermediate surfaces, transferring dies<br>
between an intermediate surface and the final substrate surface, and<br>
transferring dies directly from a support surface to the final substrate surface.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a flowchart 600 providing steps for transferring dies<br>
from a first surface to a second surface, according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Structural embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the following<br>
discussion. These steps are described in detail below.<br>
Flowchart. 600 begins with step 602. In step 602, a plurality of dies<br>
attached to a support surface are received. For example, the dies are dies 104,<br>
which are shown attached to a support surface 404 in FIG. 4A. The support<br>
surface can be a "green tape" as would be known to persons skilled in the<br>
relevant art(s).<br>
In step 604, the plurality of dies are transferred to a subsequent surface.<br>
For example, dies 104 may be transferred according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention. For example, the dies may be transferred by an adhesive<br>
tape, a punch tape, a multi-barrel transport mechanism and/or process, or a die<br>
frame, such as are further described below, and may be transferred by other<br>
mechanisms and processes, or by combinations of the mechanisms/processes<br>
described herein. In embodiments, the subsequent surface can be an<br>
intermediate surface or an actual final substrate. For example, the<br>
intermediate surface can be a transfer surface, including a "blue tape" as<br>
would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art(s). When the subsequent<br><br>
surface is a substrate, the subsequent surface may be a substrate structure that<br>
includes a plurality of tag substrates, or may be another substrate type.<br>
In step 606, it is determined whether the subsequent surface is a final<br>
surface. If the subsequent surface is a substrate to which the dies are going to<br>
be permanently attached, the process of flowchart 600 is complete. Thus, as<br>
shown in FIG. 6, the process proceeds to step 310 of flowchart 300, as shown<br>
in FIG. 3. If the subsequent surface is not a final surface, then the process<br>
proceeds to step 604, where the plurality of dies are then transferred to another<br>
subsequent surface. Steps 604 and 606 may be repeated as many times as is<br>
required by the particular application.<br>
Any of the intermediate/transfer surfaces and final substrate surfaces<br>
may or may not have cells formed therein for dies to reside therein. Various<br>
processes described below may be used to transfer multiple dies<br>
simultaneously between first and second surfaces, according to embodiments<br>
of the present invention. In any of the processes described herein, dies may be<br>
transferred in either pads-up or pads-down orientations from one surface to<br>
another.<br>
The die transfer processes described herein include transfer using an<br>
adhesive surface, a parallel die punch process, a multi-barrel die collect<br>
process, a die frame, and a die support frame. Elemenis of the die transfer<br>
processes described herein may be combined in any way, as would be<br>
understood by persons skilled in the relevant art(s). These die transfer<br>
processes, and related example structures for performing these processes, are<br>
further described in the following subsections.<br>
2.1.1 Die Transfer Using an Adhesive Surface<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, an adhesive<br>
substance coated onto a second surface may be pressed against separated die<br>
that reside on a first surface, causing the die to attach to the adhesively coated<br>
second surface. The second surface may be moved away from the first<br>
surface, to carry the attached die away from the first surface. The die can then<br><br>
be transferred to subsequent intermediate/transfer surfaces, or to a final<br>
surface, such as a substrate.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a flowchart 700 providing steps for transferring a<br>
plurality of dies from a first surface to a second surface using an adhesive<br>
surface. For illustrative purposes, flowchart 700 will be described in reference<br>
to FIGS. 8-10, although the process of flowchart 700 is not limited to the<br>
structures shown in FIGS. 8-10.<br>
Flowchart 700 begins with step 702. In step 702, the second surface is<br>
positioned to be closely adjacent to the first surface that has a plurality of dies<br>
attached thereto. For example, as shown in FIG. 8, a plurality of dies 104 are<br>
attached to a first surface 802. A second surface 804 is positioned closely to<br>
first surface 802. In embodiments, for example, surface 802 may be a scribed<br>
wafer or support surface, or may be an intermediate surface. Furthermore,<br>
second surface 804 may be an intermediate or transfer surface, or may be a<br>
substrate surface. An example support surface is shown in FIG. 4A, as<br>
support surface 404. Second surface 804 may be a green tape or a blue tape,<br>
as they are known in the industry, for example.<br>
In step 704, a distance between the first surface and a second surface is<br>
reduced until the plurality of dies contact the second surface and attach to the<br>
second surface due to an adhesiveness of the second surface. An example of<br>
this is shown in FIG. 9. As shown in FIG. 9, second surface 802 is in contact<br>
with plurality of dies 104. Either or both of first and second surfaces 802 and<br>
804 may be moved to cause the contact. Note that second surface 804 may<br>
have the adhesiveness because it is an adhesive tape, or may be a surface that<br>
has an adhesive material, such as an epoxy, glue, or wax applied thereto, to<br>
cause it to be adhesive.<br>
In step 706, the first surface and second surface are moved apart,<br>
whereby the plurality of dies remain attached to the second surface. For<br>
example, this is illustrated in FIG. 10. As shown in FIG. 10, first surface 802<br>
and second surface 804 have been moved apart, and the plurality of dies 104<br>
remain attached to second surface 804. The plurality of dies 104 are detached<br><br>
from first surface 802. The plurality of dies 104 remain attached to second<br>
surface 804 due to a greater adhesiveness of second surface 804 relative to<br>
first surface 802.<br>
In an embodiment, flowchart 700 may include the additional step<br>
where an adhesive material is applied to the second surface so that the<br>
adhesiveness of the second surface is greater than that of the first surface.<br>
Note that overlapping (including identical) means may be used to<br>
perform steps 704 and 706 to reduce the distance between the first and second<br>
surfaces, and to move the first and second surfaces apart, or different means<br>
may be used. For example, the means used for performing steps 704 and/or<br>
706 may include the use of rollers, piston-type punching techniques, air jets,<br>
and/or any other suitable mechanisms described elsewhere herein or otherwise<br>
known.<br>
Note that flowchart 700 is applicable to dies being oriented in a pads-<br>
up or pads-down orientation on either of first and second surfaces 802 and<br>
804. For example, flowchart 700 may include the further step where the<br>
plurality of dies attached to the first surface are oriented so that at least one<br>
contact pad of each die of the plurality of dies is facing away from the first<br>
surface. Hence, when the first surface and second surface are moved apart, the<br>
plurality of dies will remain attached to the second surface in a pads-down<br>
manner. Alternatively, flowchart 700 can include the step where the plurality<br>
of dies attached to the first surface are oriented so that at least one contact pad<br>
of each die of the plurality of dies is facing towards the :5xst surface. Hence,<br>
when the first surface and second surface are moved apart, the plurality of dies<br>
remain attached to the second surface in a pads-up manner.<br>
In embodiments, the process of flowchart 700 may be implemented on<br>
any portion of, or all of the separated die on the first surface. For example,<br>
this process may be accomplished in one or more iterations, using one or more<br>
strips of an adhesive coated second surface 804 that each adhere to and carry<br>
away a single column of die 104 from first surface 802. Alternatively, a sheet<br><br>
sized adhesive coated second surface 804 may be used to adhere to and carry<br>
away multiple columns/any size array of die 104 from first surface 802.<br>
The following two subsections are presented herein to provide more<br>
detailed examples of die transfer using an adhesive surface, for illustrative<br>
purposes. However, the present invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
2.1.1.1 Pads Up Transfer<br>
As described herein with reference to FIG. 3, in step 308, dies 104 can<br>
be transferred from support surface 404 to tag substrate 116 in a "pads up"<br>
manner. When a die 104 is transferred to tag substrate 116 in this manner, it is<br>
oriented so that connecting pads 204a-d face away from tag substrate 116.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating performance of step 308 in greater<br>
detail for "pads up" transfer. This performance begins with a step 1102. In<br>
step 1102, one or more dies 104 are oriented for "pads up" transfer from<br>
support surface 404 onto tag substrate 116. Step 1102 is described in greater<br>
detail with reference to FIGs. 12A, 12B, 13, 14, and 15, which provide<br>
exemplary views of dies 104, support surface 404, a transfer surface 1202, and<br>
tag substrate 116 during various stages of a "pads up" transfer operation.<br>
Step 1102 comprises transferring die(s) 104 onto a transfer surface.<br>
Thus, step 1102 includes steps 1120 and 1122. In step 1120, die(s) 104 are<br>
placed in contact with transfer surface 1202. A performance of this step is<br>
illustrated in FIGs. 12A and 12B, which provide views of a die 104 in contact<br>
with support surface 404 and transfer surface 1202. Transfer surface 1202 is<br>
an adhesive material, such as tape. Placing die(s) 104 in contact with transfer<br>
surface 1202 can include the step of reducing the physical separation between<br>
support surface 404 and transfer surface 1202 until die 104 contacts transfer<br>
surface 1202. This can be performed through the use of rollers, piston-type<br>
punching techniques, and/or air jets.<br>
Step 1120 further includes the step of aligning transfer surface 1202<br>
with one or more rows 402. For example, FIG. 12A shows transfer surface<br>
1202 aligned with row 402a. In this example, transfer surface 1202 has a<br><br>
width 1204 that is selected to contact a single row 402 of dies 104. However,<br>
other widths 1202 can be employed that enable contact with multiple rows<br>
402.<br>
In step 1122, die(s) 104 are removed from support surface 404, thereby<br>
resulting in the transfer of die(s) 104 from support surface 404 to transfer<br>
surface 1202. FIG. 13 is a view of a plurality of dies 104 transferred to<br>
transfer surface 1202. Removal of die(s) 104 from support surface 404 can<br>
include the steps of providing a stronger adhesive on transfer surface 1202<br>
than on support surface 404, and increasing the physical separation between<br>
support surface 404 and transfer surface 1202. Alternatively, removal of dies<br>
104 from support surface 404 can include the steps of providing a release<br>
adhesive on support surface 404 that loses its adhesive properties upon a<br>
release action, such as exposure to thermal energy, radiation, or ultraviolet<br>
light, and creating a release action at a time when removal is desired.<br>
After performance of 1102, a step 1104 is performed. Li step 1104, an<br>
adhesive is applied to tag substrate 116. This adhesive will provide a bond<br>
between die 104 and tag substrate 116.<br>
A step 1106 follows step 1104. In step 1106, die(s) 104 are transferred<br>
onto tag substrate 116 in a "pads up" manner. Step 1106 includes the steps of<br>
placing die(s) 104 in contact with tag substrate 116 and removing die(s) 104<br>
from transfer surface 1202. Snapshots from a performance of step 1106 are<br>
illustrated in FIGs. 14 and 15.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a die 104n in contact with a transfer surface 1202 and<br>
tag substrate 116. Die 104n is in contact with a cell or indentation 1402 that is<br>
formed on tag substrate 116. Indentation 1402 enables connection pads 204 to<br>
be substantially even with surface(s) on tag substrate 116 that accommodate<br>
related electronics 106. Placing die(s) 104 in contact with tag substrate 116<br>
includes the step of reducing the physical separation between transfer surface<br>
1202 and tag substrate 116 until die 104 contacts tag substrate 116. This can<br>
be performed through the use of rollers, piston-type punching techniques,<br>
and/or air jets. In addition, placing die(s) 104 in contact with tag substrate 116<br><br>
in a "pads up" orientation includes the step of aligning die(s) 104 with<br>
corresponding indentations 1402.<br>
Removal of die(s) 104 from transfer surface 1202 can include the steps<br>
of providing a stronger adhesive on tag substrate 116 than on transfer surface<br>
1202, and increasing the physical separation between transfer surface 1202<br>
and tag substrate 104. Alternatively, removal of dies 104 from support surface<br>
404 can include the steps of providing a release adhesive on transfer surface<br>
1202 that loses it adhesive properties upon a release action, such as exposure<br>
to thermal energy, radiation, or ultraviolet light, and creating a release action<br>
at a time when removal is desired.<br>
FIG. 15 shows a die 104n released from transfer surface 1202 and<br>
transferred to tag substrate 116. As illustrated in FIG. 15, pads 204 are<br>
substantially even with surfaces 1502 and 1504 of tag substrate 116, thereby<br>
enabling electrical connections to be easily formed between pads 204 and<br>
related electronics 106 printed on these surfaces.<br>
After step 1106, a step 1108 is performed. In step 1108, related<br>
electronics 106 are printed on tag substrate 116. Step 1106 can comprise the<br>
steps of printing related electronics 106 onto tag substrate 116 through a<br>
screen printing process, an ink jet process, and/or a thermal spray process.<br>
Alternatively, step 1106 can comprise the step of removing conductive<br>
material already disposed on tag substrate 116 through an oblation process.<br>
After step 1108, a step 1110 is performed. In step 1110, an<br>
overcoating is applied on tag substrate 116. This overcoating protects<br>
elements of tag 100, such as die 104 and related electronics 106, from<br>
mechanical forces. In addition, this overcoating provides electrical insulation.<br>
Moreover, this overcoating can provide a compression force on tag substrate<br>
116 to further ensure proper connections between related electronics 106 and<br>
die 104. Such a compression force can be provided through the use of heat<br>
shrinkable materials.<br><br>
2.1.1.2 Pads Down Transfer<br>
As described herein with reference to FIG. 3, in step 308, dies 104 can<br>
be transferred from support surface 404 to tag substrate 116 in a "pads down"<br>
manner. When a die 104 is transferred to tag substrate 116 in this manner, it is<br>
oriented so that connecting pads 204a-d face towards tag substrate 116.<br>
FIG. 16 is a flowchart illustrating a performance of step 308 in greater<br>
detail for "pads down" transfer. This performance begins with a step 1602. In<br>
step 1602, one or more dies 104 are oriented for pads down transfer from<br>
support surface 404 onto tag substrate 116. Step 1602 is described in greater<br>
detail with reference to FIGs. 12A, 12B, 13-15, and 17-20. These drawings<br>
provide exemplary views of dies 104, support surface 404, a transfer surface<br>
1202, a secondary transfer surface 1702, and tag substrate 116 during various<br>
stages of a "pads down" transfer operation.<br>
Step 1602 comprises a step 1620 of transferring die(s) 104 onto a<br>
primary transfer surface and a step 1622 of transferring die(s) 104 onto a<br>
secondary transfer surface.<br>
In step 1620, die(s) 104 are placed in contact with transfer surface<br>
1202 and removed from support surface 404, thereby resulting in the transfer<br>
of die(s) 104 from support surface 404 to transfer surface 1202.<br>
FIGs. 12A and 12B provide views of a die 104 in contact with support<br>
surface 404 and transfer surface 1202. Transfer surface 1202 is an adhesive<br>
material, such as tape. Placing die(s) 104 in contact with transfer surface<br>
1202 can include the step of reducing the physical separation between support<br>
surface 404 and transfer surface 1202 until die 104 contacts transfer surface<br>
1202. This can be performed through the use of rollers, piston-type punching<br>
techniques, and/or air jets.<br>
FIG. 13 is a view of a plurality of dies 104 removed from support<br>
surface 404 and transferred to transfer surface 1202. Removal of die(s) 104<br>
from support surface 404 can include the steps of providing a stronger<br>
adhesive on transfer surface 1202 than on support surface 404, and increasing<br>
the physical separation between support surface 404 and transfer surface 1202.<br><br>
Alternatively, removal of dies 104 from support surfaces 404 can include the<br>
steps of providing a release adhesive on support surface 404 that loses it<br>
adhesive properties upon a release action, such as exposure to thermal energy,<br>
radiation, or ultraviolet light, and creating a release action at a time when<br>
removal is desired.<br>
After step 1620, a step 1622 is performed. In step 1622, die(s) 104 are<br>
transferred from, transfer surface 1202 onto secondary transfer surface 1702.<br>
In step 1622, die(s) 104 are placed in contact with secondary transfer surface<br>
1702. FIG. 17 provides an exemplary view of such contact, where die(s) 104<br>
are in contact with transfer surface 1202 and secondary transfer surface 1702.<br>
Placing die(s) 104 in contact with secondary transfer surface 1702 can include<br>
the step of reducing the physical separation between support surface 404 and<br>
transfer surface 1202 until die 104 contacts transfer surface 1202. This can be<br>
performed through the use of rollers, piston-type punching techniques, and/or<br>
air jets.<br>
Next, pursuant to step 1622, die(s) 104 are removed from transfer<br>
surface 1202 to complete the transfer to secondary transfer surface 1702. FIG.<br>
18 is a view of a die 104 that has been removed from transfer surface 1202,<br>
and is therefore transferred to secondary transfer surface 1702. As described<br>
herein, both transfer surface 1202 and secondary transfer surface 1702 are<br>
adhesive surfaces. Thus, removal of die(s) 104 from transfer surface 1202 can<br>
include the steps of providing a stronger adhesive on secondary transfer<br>
surface 1702 than on transfer surface 1202, and increasing the physical<br>
separation between transfer surface 1202 and secondary transfer surface 1702.<br>
Alternatively, removal of die(s) 104 from transfer surface 1202 can include the<br>
steps of providing a release adhesive on transfer surface 1202 that loses it<br>
adhesive properties upon a release action, such as exposure to thermal energy,<br>
radiation, or ultraviolet light, and creating a release action at a time when<br>
removal is desired.<br>
In step 1604, related electronics 106 are printed onto tag substrate 116.<br>
Step 1604 can comprise the steps of printing related electronics 106 onto tag<br><br>
substrate 116 through a screen printing process, an ink jet process, and/or a<br>
thermal spray process. Alternatively, step 1604 can comprise the step of<br>
removing conductive material already disposed on tag substrate 116 through<br>
an oblation process.<br>
In step 1606, a layer of conductive adhesive is placed on tag substrate<br>
116. This step comprises applying an anisotropic adhesive that conducts<br>
electricity in a single dimension. One such adhesive is commercially available<br>
"z-axis" adhesive, which is well-known in the relevant arts. Anisotropic<br>
adhesives conduct electricity in a single direction. Therefore, they<br>
advantageously enable electrical connections to be established between<br>
connecting pads 204 and related electronics 106 without shorting connecting<br>
pads 204 together.<br>
In step 1608, die(s) 104 are transferred onto tag substrate 116 in a<br>
"pads down" manner. The anisotropic adhesive layer placed on tag substrate<br>
116 in step 1606 provides an electrical connection between each connecting<br>
pad 204 and corresponding elements of related electronics 106. Step 1608<br>
comprises the steps of placing die(s) 104 in contact with tag substrate 116 and<br>
removing die(s) 104 from secondary transfer surface 1702.<br>
Placing die(s) 104 in contact with tag substrate 116 can include the<br>
step of reducing the physical separation between secondary transfer surface<br>
1702 and tag substrate 116 until die 104 contacts tag substrate 116. This can<br>
be performed through the use of rollers, piston-type punching techniques,<br>
and/or air jets. FIG. 19 is a view of a "pads down" oriented die 104 in contact<br>
with secondary transfer surface 1702 and tag substrate 116. As shown in FIG.<br>
19, a punching member 1902 can be used to punch secondary transfer surface<br>
1702 at a location opposite of die 104, to transfer die 104 from secondary<br>
transfer surface 1702 to tag substrate 116. As describe above, other transfer<br>
mechanisms and/or processes may be alternatively used.<br>
Removal of die(s) 104 from secondary transfer surface 1702 can<br>
include the steps of providing a stronger adhesive on tag substrate 116 than on<br>
secondary transfer surface 1702, and increasing the physical separation<br><br>
between secondary transfer surface 1702 and tag substrate 116. Alternatively,<br>
removal of dies 104 from secondary transfer surface 1702 can include the<br>
steps of providing a release adhesive on secondary transfer surface 1702 that<br>
loses its adhesive properties upon a release action, such as exposure to thermal<br>
energy, radiation, or ultraviolet light, and creating a release action at a time<br>
when removal is desired. FIG. 20 is a view of a "pads down" oriented die 104<br>
attached to tag substrate 116.<br>
2.1.2	Parallel Die Punch onto a Support Surface<br>
According to a parallel die punch process of the present invention, a<br>
second surface, such as a punch tape, is aligned over separated dies attached to<br>
a first surface. The punch tape has multiple die receptor holes, "divots," or<br>
cells formed in a surface. Each receptor cell in the punch tape is aligned with<br>
a corresponding die of the first surface. Multiple mechanical punches are<br>
actuated to push the die from the first surface into the corresponding receptor<br>
cell of the punch tape, in this manner, any number of dies, including tens and<br>
hundreds of dies, can be transferred simultaneously into the punch tape,<br>
instead of merely transferring one die at a time.<br>
FIG. 21 shows a flowchart 2100 providing steps for transferring a<br>
plurality of dies from a first surface to a second surface using a parallel<br>
punching process, according to embodiments of the present invention. Note<br>
that steps of flowchart 800 that are optional are shown enclosed in dotted<br>
lines. Further structural embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in<br>
the relevant art(s) based on the following discussion.<br>
Flowchart 2100 will be described in relation to FIGS. 22-29, for<br>
illustrative purposes. A perspective view of an example punch tape 2200 is<br>
shown in FIG. 22, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 23 shows a cross-sectional view of punch tape 2200. As shown in<br>
FIG. 22, punch tape 2200 has a plurality of cells 2202 formed in a top surface.<br>
In some embodiments, punch tape 2200 may further have a plurality of guide<br>
holes 2204 formed in the top surface.<br><br>
As the example shown in FIG. 23, punch tape 2200 may be formed<br>
from a punch tape body 2302 and an adhesive tape 2304. Adhesive tape 2304<br>
is attached to a bottom surface of punch tape body 2302. Punch tape body<br>
2302 is typically flexible, and may have a variety of thicknesses, including<br>
thicknesses ranging from 5 mils to 11 mils, or other thicknesses. Punch tape<br>
body 2302 may be made from plastic or from other flexible or non-flexible<br>
material. Adhesive tape 2304 may be any type of adhesive tape or other<br>
adhesive material. Alternatively, punch tape 2200 may be a conventional chip<br>
carrier as are available in the industry, and/or may be a single piece punch<br>
tape.<br>
Cells 2202 are open on a top surface of punch tape 2200 and are not<br>
open on the bottom surface of punch tape 2200. Plurality of cells 2202 are<br>
formed from a plurality of openings through punch tapis body 2302, having<br>
one end covered by adhesive tape 2304. The openings may be preformed, or<br>
may be formed in punch tape 2200 by laser etching, or by other process.<br>
When present, guide holes 2204 may penetrate all the way through<br>
punch tape 2200 to be open at the bottom and top surfaces of punch tape 2200,<br>
or may be open at only one of the two surfaces. Guide: holes 2204 may be<br>
used to align punch tape 2200 with a surface.<br>
In the discussion that follows, punch tape 2200 is described as<br>
receiving dies from a support surface, and transferring dies to a substrate.<br>
However, in embodiments, for example, punch tape 2200 may receive dies<br>
from a surface that is a scribed wafer or support surface;, or an intermediate<br>
surface. Furthermore, punch tape 220 may transfer dies to an Intermediate or<br>
transfer surface, or to a substrate surface.<br>
Flowchart 2100 shown in FIG. 21 begins with step 2102. In step 2102,<br>
a support surface is positioned closely adjacent to a surface of a punch tape,<br>
such that each die of a plurality of dies attached to a first surface of the support<br>
surface is closely adjacent to a corresponding empty cell of a plurality of<br>
empty cells in the surface of the punch tape. FIG. 24 illustrates step 2102.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 24, the support surface of step 2102 may be<br><br>
support surface 404, which is positioned closely adjacent to punch tape 2200.<br>
As shown in FIG. 24, a plurality of dies 104a are attached to support surface<br>
404, and another plurality of dies 104b are attached to the surface of support<br>
surface 404. Each die of plurality of dies 104a is positioned closely adjacent<br>
to an empty cell 2202 in punch tape 2200.<br>
FIG. 24 also shows a punching apparatus 2402 positioned adjacent to<br>
support surface 404, according to an example embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Punching apparatus 2402 includes a body 2404 and a plurality of<br>
punching members 2406. Punching members 2406 are attached to body 2404.<br>
In embodiments, punching body 2402 may be any type of applicable punching<br>
device, including a flat surface having punching members 2406 extending<br>
therefrom, or may be a rolling-pin type device with punching members 2406<br>
extending outward radially therefrom. Punching apparatus 2402 may be<br>
configured in additional ways.<br>
In step 2104, all dies of the plurality of dies are simultaneously<br>
transferred into closely adjacent, corresponding empty cells from the support<br>
surface. For example, as shown in FIG. 25, all dies of plurality of dies 104A<br>
are simultaneously being transferred into the corresponding empty cells 2202<br>
of punch tape 2200 by punching apparatus 2402. As shown in FIG. 25,<br>
punching mechanism 2402 has moved upward to push each of the plurality of<br>
dies 104A into their corresponding cells 2202 by pushing through substrate<br>
surface 404. As shown in FIG. 25, substrate surface 404 substantially flexes<br>
to allow punching members 2406 to push plurality of dies 104a upwards<br>
without substantial damage to support surface 404. Although not shown in<br>
FIG. 25, plurality of dies 104a become attached in cells 2202 due to the<br>
adhesiveness of adhesive tape 2304, and remain in cells 2202 after punching<br>
members 2406 are removed or retracted.<br>
In optional step 2106, the punch tape is incremented relative to the<br>
support surface to position each die of another plurality of dies attached to the<br>
first surface of the support surface closely adjacent to a corresponding empty<br>
cell of another plurality of empty cells in the surface of the punch tape. For<br><br>
example, as shown in FIG. 26, punch tape 2200 has been moved and<br>
positioned closely adjacent to plurality of dies 104b such that an empty cell<br>
2202 of punch tape 2200 is closely adjacent to each die of plurality of dies<br>
104b.<br>
Note that the process of incrementing punch tape 2200 relative to<br>
support surface 404 means that any one or more of punch tape 2200, support<br>
surface 404, and/or punching mechanism 2402 may be moved in order to<br>
properly position these elements relative to dies 104 on support surface 404.<br>
In optional step 2108, all dies of the another plurality of dies are<br>
simultaneously transferred from the support surface into closely adjacent<br>
corresponding empty cells. For example, as shown in FIG. 26, punching<br>
mechanism 2402 pushes each die of plurality of dies 104b into the adjacent<br>
cell 2202. Plurality of dies 104b become attached in cells 2202 due to an<br>
adhesiveness of adhesive tape 2304.<br>
In optional step 2110, steps 2106 and 2108 can be repeated until<br>
substantially all dies attached to the support surface have been transferred<br>
from the support surface to the punch tape. Note that optional steps 2106,<br>
2108, and 2110 apply to embodiments where multiple iterations are required<br>
to punch plurality of dies from one surface to another so that all dies attached<br>
to the first surface are transferred to the second surface. In other words, for<br>
example, the plurality of dies that are transferred in a single step may be<br>
substantially equal to one out of every N dies of a total number of dies<br>
attached to the support surface. Thus, in such an embodiment, the support<br>
surface may be positioned closely adjacent to the surface of the punch tape,<br>
such that each die of the one out of every N dies attached to the first surface of<br>
the support surface is closely adjacent to a corresponding empty cell of the<br>
plurality of empty cells in the surface of the punch tape. Hence, the plurality<br>
of dies are transferred, but not all dies.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the plurality of dies transferred may be<br>
all of the dies attached to the first surface, so that further iterations are not<br>
required. For example, FIG. 27 shows a plurality of dies 104 attached to<br><br>
support surface 404, where each die is positioned closely adjacent to<br>
corresponding cell 2202 in punch tape 2200. As shown in FIG. 27, punching<br>
mechanism 2402 has a plurality of punching memhers 2406 that correspond to<br>
plurality of dies 104. Hence, when punching members 2406 simultaneously<br>
punch upward into support surface 404, all dies of plurality of dies 104 are<br>
moved into corresponding cells 2202 of punch tape 2200, simultaneously.<br>
Note that the punch mechanism die transfer embodiments described<br>
herein are applicable to both pads-up and pads-down die orientations. Hence,<br>
plurality of dies 104 may be transferred into corresponding cells 2202 with<br>
pads facing in or out of the corresponding cells 2202, as desired. Furthermore,<br>
punching mechanism embodiments may be alternated with adhesive tape<br>
transfer embodiments described above in order to flip the orientation of dies<br>
104. Hence, an adhesive tape may be used to transfer dies one or more times<br>
followed by a final transfer of the plurality of dies 104 by the punching<br>
mechanism. Hence, the adhesive tape embodiments may be used to orient the<br>
dies with either pads up or pads down prior to being punched into cells 2202.<br>
For instance, in an example step 2106, support surface 404 may be<br>
incremented by one column of dies 104 relative to punch tape. Punch tape<br>
2200 may be spooled on a roll. Punch tape 2200 is advanced so that empty die<br>
receptor cells 2202 are aligned over a column of dies 104 on support surface<br>
404. Dies 104 in the column of support surface 404 are punched into the<br>
empty die receptor cells 2202 in step 2108. Support surface 404 may then be<br>
again incremented by one column, and punch tape 2200 is again advanced, so<br>
that the next column of dies 104 of support surface 404 may be punched into<br>
further empty die receptor cells of punch tape 2200. This procedure may be<br>
repeated until support surface 404 is exhausted of dies 104.<br>
Example die transfer embodiments using a punching mechanism are<br>
described in detail in the following subsection.<br><br>
2.1.2.1	Direct transfer from support surface to antenna substrate<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a punching<br>
mechanism may simultaneously transfer each die of a plurality of dies from a<br>
first surface directly onto a corresponding antenna substrate. In embodiments<br>
where the first surface is a support surface that attaches separated dies from a<br>
wafer, this process allows for extremely rapid fabrication of a large number of<br>
electronic devices, such as RFID tags 100.<br>
Steps 2102 and 2104 of flowchart 2100 support the transfer for die<br>
from a support surface to a substrate, where instead of using a punch tape as a<br>
second surface, an substrate is used as the second surface. FIG. 28 illustrates<br>
an example using punching mechanism 2402 to transfer a plurality of dies 104<br>
from a support surface 404 to a substrate structure 2802 that includes a<br>
plurality of tag substrate portions (i.e., tag substrates 116a-d).<br>
As shown in FIG. 28, punching mechanism 2402 has a plurality of<br>
punching members 2406 that are positioned adjacent to dies 104 on an<br>
opposite surface of support surface 404. In a modified step 2102, support<br>
surface 404 is positioned closely adjacent to a surface of substrate structure<br>
2802, such that each die 104 of the plurality of dies is closely adjacent to a tag<br>
substrate 116. Each tag substrate 116 has contact areas 210a and 210b for<br>
coupling to contact pads 204a and 204b of each die 104.<br>
Note that an underfill material layer 2804 can be optionally applied to<br>
the surface of substrate structure 2802. This allows foi each die 104 to be<br>
underfilled when attached to substrate structure 2802.<br>
In a modified step 2104, all dies 104 of the plurality of dies are<br>
simultaneously transferred onto the closely adjacent, corresponding tag<br>
substrate 116 from support surface 404. For example, as shown in FIG. 28,<br>
punching members 2408 may be moved in the direction of arrow 2408 to<br>
transfer dies 104. FIG. 29 shows substrate structure 2802 with each of dies<br>
104 attached to a corresponding one of tag substrates 116a-d. Underfill<br>
material layer 2804 provides for an underfill material to be located between<br><br>
each die 104 and tag substrate 116. Example underfill materials suitable for<br>
underfill material layer 2804 are further described in the following section.<br>
In this manner, a plurality of RFID tags 100 may be rapidly created,<br>
with fewer process steps. Tag substrates 116a-d shown in FIG. 29 may be<br>
subsequently separated to create a plurality of individual RFID tags 100. Note<br>
that while FIGS. 28 and 29 show the transfer of dies 104 directly to tag<br>
substrates 116 in a "pads down" orientation, it will be understood to persons<br>
skilled in the relevant art(s) from the teachings herein that this transfer of dies<br>
104 directly to tag substrates 116 may also be accomplished in a "pads up"<br>
orientation.<br>
2.1.2.2	Underfill Material Embodiments<br>
According to a parallel die punch embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a second surface, such as punch tape 2200, is aligned over separated dies 104<br>
attached to a first surface. Each receptor cell 2202 in punch tape 2202 has a<br>
corresponding die 104 placed therein. Each cell 2202 is then filled with an<br>
underfill material. Punching mechanism 2402 is actuated to move the die 104<br>
from punch tape 2202 onto corresponding tag substrates 116 of substrate<br>
structure 2802. In this manner, any number of dies, including tens and<br>
hundreds of dies, can be transferred simultaneously from punch tape 2200,<br>
instead of merely transferring one die at a time. Furthermore, by applying the<br>
underfill material prior to transferring dies 104 to tag substrates 116, each die<br>
can be easily underfilled on the respective tag substrate 116 during the transfer<br>
process, providing numerous advantages.<br>
FIG. 30 shows a flowchart 3000 providing steps for assembling RFID<br>
tags, according to embodiments of the present invention. Note that steps of<br>
flowchart 3000 that are optional are shown enclosed in dotted lines.<br>
Flowchart 3000 will be described in relation to FIGS. 31-47, for illustrative<br>
purposes. Further structural embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled<br>
in the relevant art(s) based on the following discussion.<br><br>
Flowchart 3000 begins with step 3002. In step 3002, a plurality of dies<br>
are transferred from a support surface to a chip carrier that has a plurality of<br>
cells accessible on a first surface of the chip carrier so that each die of the<br>
plurality of dies resides in a corresponding cell of the plurality of cells and is<br>
recessed in the corresponding cell with respect to the first surface. For<br>
example, the chip carrier is a punch tape, such as punch tape 2200 shown in<br>
FIG. 31. As shown in FIG. 31, punch tape 2200 has example empty first and<br>
second cells 2202a and 2202b. FIGS. 32 and 33 show first and second dies<br>
104a and 104b being transferred into first and second cells 2202a and 2202b.<br>
First and second dies 104a and 104b may be transferred into first and second<br>
cells 2202a and 2202b by any process described here or otherwise known,<br>
including by a pick and place process. First and second dies 104a and 104b<br>
may be transferred into first and second cells 2202a and 2202b one at a time,<br>
as shown in FIGS. 32 and 33, or simultaneously. Note that two dies are shown<br>
in the current example for illustrative purposes, and that the present invention<br>
is applicable to any number of dies.<br>
In step 3004, an underfill material is applied into each cell of the<br>
plurality of cells. For example, as shown in FIG. 34, an underfill material<br>
3402 is applied into first and second cells 2202a and 2202b to substantially<br>
cover each of dies 104a and 104b, shown as first and second underfill material<br>
portions 3402a and 3402b. Underfill material 3004 is used to underfill dies<br>
104 when attached to a substrate, such as a tag substrate 116, for purposes<br>
such as environmental and hermetic protection, among other reasons.<br>
In embodiments, underfill material 3402 may be any underfill material<br>
conventionally known to persons skilled in the relevant art(s). Underfill<br>
material 3402 may be electrically conductive, or electrically non-conductive.<br>
For example, underfill material 3402 may be isotropically conductive, i.e.,<br>
substantially uniformly conductive in all directions. Furthermore, underfill<br>
material 3402 may be anisotropically conductive, i.e., conductive in a desired<br>
direction. For example, underfill material 3402 may be a Z-axis epoxy.<br><br>
In an embodiment, the amount of underfill material 3402 applied in<br>
each cell 2202 can be controlled, so that an amount required by the particular<br>
application is present. For example, FIG. 34 shows first and second underfill<br>
material 3402a and 3402b have been applied so that the underfill material<br>
extends out of first and second cells 2202a and 2202b. In another example,<br>
FIG. 35 shows first and second underfill material 3402a and 3402b have been<br>
applied so that the underfill material is flush or even with the top surface of<br>
punch tape 2200. For example, in order to cause underfill material 3402 to be<br>
flush or even with the top surface of punch tape 2200, a "squeegee" process<br>
may be used. FIG. 36 shows an example squeegee process being performed.<br>
A squeegee element 3602 is passed along the top surface of punch tape 2200,<br>
smoothing first underfill material 3402a in first cell 2202a, for example. An<br>
excess underfill material 3604 is shown being removed. In the example of<br>
FIG. 36, underfill material 3402 was applied to cells 2202 before squeegee<br>
element 3602 was applied. Alternatively, underfill material 3402 may be<br>
applied by squeegee element 3602.<br>
In the example of FIGS. 34-36, a height of each die 104 is<br>
approximately equal to half of a height of the corresponding cell 2202.<br>
Underfill material 3604 fills a remaining half of the height of the cell 2202.<br>
With such an amount of underfill material 3604 in cell 2202 relative to the size<br>
of die 104, enough underfill material 3604 is present to underfill die 104 when<br>
attached to substrate 116, without having excess underfill material. However,<br>
the present invention is applicable to higher and lower proportions of underfill<br>
material 3604 in cells 2202.<br>
In optional step 3006 of flowchart 3000, the first surface of the chip<br>
carrier is positioned closely adjacent to a surface of a substrate structure<br>
having a plurality of tag substrate portions. For example, FIG. 37 shows an<br>
example substrate structure 2802. Substrate structure 2802 includes a plurality<br>
of tag substrate portions (i.e., tag substrates 116), also referred to as a web or<br>
array of tag substrates. Substrate structure 2802 includes any number of tag<br>
substrates 116, and may be shaped into any size column, row, or array of tag<br><br>
substrates 116. FIG. 38 shows substrate structure 2802 of FIG. 37 after having<br>
been separated into separate strip-shaped tag substrate structures 2802a,<br>
2802b, 2802c, and 2802d. Substrate structure 2802 may be separated into<br>
strips by sawing, cutting, by laser, and by other processes. A strip for<br>
substrate structure 2802 can be conveniently used to transfer dies 104 from<br>
punch tape 2200, which typically is also formed in a strip.<br>
FIG. 39 shows a view of a portion of strip-shaped substrate structure<br>
2802a. Substrate structure 2802 includes first and second tag substrates 116a<br>
and 116b. First tag substrate 116a includes an antenna 114a and a guide hole<br>
3902a. Second tag substrate 116b includes an antenna 114b and a guide hole<br>
3902b.<br>
Guide holes 3902 may be used to align substrate structure 2802a with<br>
punch tape 2200. For example, guide holes 3902 may be used with guide<br>
holes 2204 shown in FIG. 22 to provide alignment. Guide holes 3902 and<br>
guide holes 2204 may be used to mechanically or optically align substrate<br>
structure 2802a with punch tape 2202. For example, mechanical alignment<br>
can include aligning punch tape 2202 using a first wheel having spaced pegs<br>
that interlock with guide holes 2204, and aligning substrate structure 2802a<br>
using a second wheel having spaced pegs that interlock with guide holes 3902.<br>
The first wheel and second wheel are synchronized.<br>
FIG. 40 shows the top surface of the punch tape 2200 being positioned<br>
closely adjacent to substrate structure 2802a, according to step 3006. Tag<br>
substrate 116a is positioned closely adjacent to cell 2202a.<br>
In optional step 3008, a second surface of the chip carrier is punched<br>
proximate to a location opposite of each cell of the plurality of cells to move<br>
each die out of the corresponding cell such that the underfill material covering<br>
each die contacts a corresponding tag substrate of the plurality of tag substrate<br>
portions. For example, as shown in FIG. 41, a punching member 4102<br>
punches the bottom surface of punch tape 2200 opposite to first cell 2202a.<br>
First die 104 moves out of first cell 2202a towards tag substrate 116a.<br>
Underfill material 3402a contacts tag substrate 116a. As shown in FIG. 42,<br><br>
punching member 4102 moves first die 104 until first die 104 comes into<br>
contact with tag substrate 116a.<br>
In optional step 3010, the first surface of each die is attached to the<br>
corresponding tag substrate so that the at least one contact pad of each die is<br>
electrically coupled to at least one corresponding contact pad of the<br>
corresponding tag substrate. For example, first die 104 is attached to tag<br>
substrate 116a such that contact pads 204a-d are electrically coupled to contact<br>
areas 210a-d of tag substrate 116a. First die 104a may be attached to tag<br>
substrate 116a in a variety of ways. For example, step 3010 may include the<br>
step where underfill material 3402 is cured to attach each die 104 to the<br>
corresponding tag substrate 116. A curable underfill material 3402 may be<br>
flash curable, thermally curable, acoustically curable, electron beam curable,<br>
ultraviolet (UV) light curable, infrared (IR) light curable, pressure curable, and<br>
other type of curable material. Hence, heat, an acoustic; source, an electron<br>
beam, UV light, IR light, and/or pressure may be applied as needed to cure<br>
underfill material 3402. A two-party epoxy may be used for a flash curable<br>
underfill material, for example.<br>
In an embodiment, curing of underfill material 3402 causes underfill<br>
material 3402 to contract or shrink. By contracting, underfill material 3402<br>
can cause a decrease in a distance between each die 104 and the corresponding<br>
tag substrate 1161, leading to improved mechanical and/or electrical coupling<br>
of contact pads 204a-d of each die 104 to the corresponding contact areas<br>
210a-d of the corresponding tag substrate 116. In such an embodiment,<br>
underfill material 3402 has a thermal coefficient of expansion/contraction that<br>
dictates the amount of contraction when cured. By selecting the material used<br>
for underfill material 3402, this coefficient can be tuned. Hence., the thermal<br>
coefficient of underfill material 3402 can by tuned to match that of tag<br>
substrate 116, or otherwise. For instance, underfill material 3402 can be tuned<br>
to contract by a particular amount, such as 2 times or 3 times its mass, for<br>
example. Underfill material 3402 can be alternatively be tuned to apply a<br>
particular force over an area, such as 50 kg/cm2, for example.<br><br>
For example, the contraction of underfill material 3402 can cause<br>
contact pads 204a-d to come into contact with the corresponding contact areas<br>
210a-d, creating a sufficient electrical connection for operation of the resulting<br>
device. Contact pads 204a-d and/or contact areas 210a-d may be substantially<br>
uniform in their smoothness or flatness so mat a large area may come into<br>
contact between them. In another example, contact pads 204a-d and/or<br>
contact areas 210a-d may be non-uniform in smoothness or flatness to enhance<br>
connectivity. For instance, contact pads 204a-d (and/or contact areas 210a-d)<br>
may have one or more bumps, spikes, peaks, etc. Thus, when contact pads<br>
204a-d come into contact with contact areas 210a-d, the one or more bumps,<br>
spikes, or peaks can partially or completely penetrate or pierce contact areas<br>
210a-d, creating an enhanced electrical and mechanical connection.<br>
In another example, in an embodiment, underfill material 3402<br>
includes electrically conductive microspheres to provide electrical<br>
connectivity. The microspheres may be gold, silver, other metal, or<br>
combination/alloy of metals, for example. Hence, when curing the<br>
contractable underfill material causes the underfill material to contract, a<br>
pressure is created between each die and corresponding tag substrate. The<br>
increased pressure causes the microspheres to form a contact between the die<br>
and substrate, and to deform, to electrically couple contact pads 204a-d to<br>
contact areas 210a-d.<br>
After die 104a is attached to tag substrate 116a, die 104b can be<br>
similarly attached to tag substrate 116b. Alternatively, dies 104a and 104b can<br>
be simultaneously attached to their respective tag substrates.<br>
In the example of FIGS. 32-42, dies 104 are oriented to be mounted on<br>
tag substrate 116 in a pads down fashion. FIG. 43-47 shows an example<br>
where dies 104 are oriented to be mounted on tag substrate 116 in a pads up<br>
fashion. For example, as shown in FIG. 43, first and second dies 104a and<br>
104b have been inserted into cell 2202a and 2202b such that contact pads<br>
204a-d face into the cells.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 44, punch tape 2200 is positioned closely adjacent to<br>
tag substrate 116a of substrate structure 2802a. As shown in FIG. 45, punch<br>
tape 2200 is punched proximate to a location of cell 2202a to move die 104a<br>
out of cell 2202a into a corresponding cell or cavity 4402 in tag substrate 116a<br>
such that underfill material 3402a substantially fills a gap between an outer<br>
edge of die 104a and cavity 4402. As shown in FIG. 45, a surface of die 104a<br>
and a surface of underfill material 3402a is substantially flush or even with the<br>
surface of tag substrate 116a.<br>
FIG. 46 shows a single die 104 attached in a cavity of tag substrate<br>
116. As shown in FIG. 46, in the current example, contact pads 204a and<br>
204b of die 104 are not electrically coupled to signals of tag substrate 116.<br>
FIG. 47 shows contact pads 204a and 204b of die 104 having been electrically<br>
coupled to contact areas 210a and 210b of tag substrate 116 by first and<br>
second electrical conductors 4702a and 4702b. For example, electrical<br>
conductors 4702 can be printed, applied by a vapor deposition process,<br>
soldered, and otherwise formed between contact pads 204 of each die 104 and<br>
contact areas 210 on the surface of the corresponding tag substrate 116.<br>
2.1.3 Multi-Barrel Die Transfer<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
dies 104 may be transferred from a first surface to a second surface using a<br>
multi-barrel die transfer apparatus. FIG. 48A shows an example multi-barrel<br>
die transfer apparatus 4802, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Multi-barrel die transfer apparatus 4802 includes a body 4804, and<br>
a plurality of barrels 4806. Body 4804 couples barrels 4806 to a gas supply<br>
and vacuum source 4810. For example, a gas such as air, nitrogen, or other<br>
gas may be supplied by vacuum source 4810. In embodiments, any number of<br>
one or more barrels 4806 may be present, but typically multiple barrels 4806<br>
are present to increase the transfer rate of dies 104 by a factor of the number of<br>
barrels 4806 present. For example, tens or hundreds of barrels may be present.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 48A, multi-barrel transfer apparatus 4802 having a<br>
plurality of barrels 4806 is positioned over separated dies 104 attached to a<br>
first surface. The first surface is shown as support surface 404 in the example<br>
of FIG. 48A. Each barrel 4806 is positioned so that a respective end 4808 of<br>
the barrel 4806 is over a respective die 104 on support surface 404. Multi-<br>
barrel transfer apparatus 4802 receives the dies 104, storing them in stacks of<br>
dies 104 in the plurality of barrels 4806. As shown in FIG. 48B, multi-barrel<br>
transfer apparatus 4802 is then positioned over a second surface. The second<br>
surface is shown as transfer surface 1202 in the example; of FIG. 48B. Multi-<br>
barrel transfer apparatus 4802 deposits the dies 104 stored in the barrels 4806<br>
on the second surface.<br>
FIG. 49 shows a flowchart 4900 providing example steps for<br>
transferring dies, according to an embodiment of the present invention. For<br>
illustrative purposes, steps of flowchart 4900 may be further described in<br>
regards to multi-barrel transfer apparatus 4802, as shown in FIGS. 49-52.<br>
However, other structural embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in<br>
the relevant art(s) based on the following discussion. These steps are<br>
described in detail below.<br>
Flowchart 4900 begins with step 4902. In step 4902, each hollow<br>
barrel of a plurality of hollow barrels is applied in parallel to a respective die<br>
residing on the first surface. For example, FIG. 50 shows a cross-sectional<br>
view of multi-barrel transfer apparatus 4802 being applied to first, surface 802.<br>
The plurality of hollow barrels are barrels 4806. Barrels 4806 are hollow so<br>
that at least a single die 104 may pass into barrel 4806 at a time, and be stored<br>
therein. As shown in FIG. 48A, each barrel 4806 is applied in parallel with<br>
the other barrels 4806 to a respective die 104 on the first surface.<br>
In step 4904, the respective die is caused to move into each hollow<br>
barrel in parallel. For example, as shown in FIG. 50, each hollow barrel 4806<br>
has a respective die 104 that has moved into the respective hollow barrel 4806.<br>
In step 4906, steps 4902 and 4904 are repeated to create a stack of dies<br>
in each hollow barrel. Hence, for example, multi-barrel transfer apparatus<br><br>
4802 may be moved as many times as needed to position barrels 4806 over<br>
respective dies so that barrels 4806 may collect the respective dies 104. For<br>
example, as shown in FIG. 50, enough dies 104 have moved into each barrel<br>
4806 to create a stack 5002 of dies 104 in each barrel 4806. Stack 5002 as<br>
shown in FIG. 50 includes two dies 104, but in embodiments may include any<br>
number of dies 104, including tens, hundreds, thousands, and even more dies.<br>
In step 4908, dies from each hollow barrel are deposited in parallel<br>
onto the second surface until the stack of dies in each hollow barrel is<br>
substantially depleted. For example, FIGS. 51 and 52 show cross-sectional<br>
views of multi-barrel transfer apparatus 4802 being applied to various second<br>
surfaces 804. As shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, barrels 4806 of multi-barrel<br>
transfer apparatus 4802 are depositing dies 104 in parallel onto second surface<br>
804. Barrels 4806 deposit dies 104 until they are substantially depleted of dies<br>
104. In other words, barrels 4806 can deposit varying amounts of dies 104<br>
onto second surface 804, depending on the number of dies required by second<br>
surface 804, and/or until one or more barrels 4806 arc; near or completely<br>
depleted of dies 104.<br>
Second surface 804 may have an adhesiveness that allows for dies 104<br>
to stick thereto. For example, second surface 804 may be an adhesive tape, or<br>
may have an adhesive material, such as a wax substance applied thereto to<br>
provide the adhesiveness. As shown in FIG. 51, second surface 804 has cells<br>
5102 formed therein, in which dies 104 are deposited from barrels 4806.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 52, second surface 804 may have a<br>
substantially planar surface onto which dies 104 are deposited. Furthermore,<br>
as shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, dies may be deposited in a pads down or pads<br>
up orientation. Barrels 4806 may be reversed end for end after collecting dies<br>
104 in order to change the orientation of dies 104 before being deposited on<br>
second surface 804. For example, ends 4808 and 5004 shown in FIG. 50 may<br>
be reversed after collecting dies 104. Alternatively, barrels 4806 can be left<br>
un-reversed.<br><br>
In an embodiment, a vacuum may be used in steps 4904 and 4908 to<br>
move dies in and out of barrels 4806. For example, a vacuum, source 4810 is<br>
shown attached to multi-barrel transfer apparatus 4804 in FIGS. 48A, 48B,<br>
and 50-51. Vacuum source 4810 may be applied to multi-barrel transfer<br>
apparatus 4804 to cause a vacuum or suction in one or more barrels 4806 to<br>
move respective dies 104 into the barrel(s) 4806. The vacuum or suction may<br>
be continuous or applied in controlled bursts. Vacuum source 4810 may also<br>
be applied or varied to move dies 104 out of barrels 4806 onto second surface<br>
804. For example, vacuum source 4810 may apply bursts of positive pressure<br>
to move individual dies 104 out of barrels 4806.<br>
Barrels 4806 may be configured to allow for proper application of<br>
vacuum source 4810. FIG. 53 shows a cross-sectional top view of an example<br>
barrel 4806 with die 104 inside, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Barrel 4806 may be rectangular as shown in FIG. 53, or may be<br>
round, or other shapes. Barrel 4806 may have a smooth interior surface 5302<br>
in an embodiment of the present invention. Alternatively, as shown in FIG.<br>
53, interior surface 5302 may have a channel 5304 formed in one or more<br>
corners to allow gas to pass around dies 104. Channels 5304 may be used to<br>
control the vacuum or pressure in barrels 4806.<br>
Barrels 4806 may be made from a metal, plastic, or other applicable<br>
material. For example, barrels 4806 may be barrels, tubes, or needles similar<br>
to hypodermic needles. Barrels 4806 are configured to collectively hold any<br>
number of dies 104. In an embodiment, the number and length of each barrel<br>
4806 will be configured to have a cumulative die 104 holding capacity of at<br>
least one wafer worth of dies 104. For example, the cumulative holding<br>
capacity may be on the order of 50,000 to 100,000 of dies 104.<br>
The filled multi-barrel die collet can be moved, robotically or<br>
otherwise, to a die dispensing station for tag assembly. An empty multi-barrel<br>
die collet can then be positioned adjacent to a new wafer of separated die on a<br>
support surface to repeat the process.<br><br>
Note that other mechanisms and/or processes may alternatively be used<br>
in step 4904 to cause dies to move into each hollow barrel, and in step 4908 to<br>
deposit dies from each hollow barrel. For example, mechanical structures and<br>
forces, chemical processes and forces, electrostatic forces, adhesive materials,<br>
a gas pressure system, and further mechanisms and processes may be used, as<br>
would be understood by persons skilled in the relevant art(s) from the<br>
teachings herein.<br>
2.1.4 Die Transfer Using a Die Frame<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
dies 104 may be transferred to a target surface using a "die frame" or "wafer<br>
tape." The die frame or wafer tape is formed directly from a wafer to hold the<br>
dies of the wafer such that they may be easily transferred to the target surface.<br>
Dies may be transferred from the die frame/wafer tape to an intermediate<br>
surface, or directly to a final surface, such as a substrate. Thus, the die frame<br>
or wafer tape of the present invention allows for fewer required manufacturing<br>
steps when transferring dies to a substrate compared to conventional transfer<br>
processes. For example, in a typical conventional process, dies are<br>
individually transferred from the wafer to an intermediate transfer surface by a<br>
pick-and-place machine. The dies are then transferred from the intermediate<br>
surface to the final destination surface. This two step process allows for the<br>
dies to be flipped. According to the present invention, dies can be directly<br>
transferred from the die frame/wafer tape to a substrate, without transfer to an<br>
intermediate surface. Furthermore, the dies can be flipped or not flipped by<br>
the transfer, as needed.<br>
Note that the die frame/wafer tape of the present invention is referred<br>
to below as a die frame, for ease of description. The die frame may be formed<br>
according to processes of the present invention, some examples of which are<br>
described below for purposes of illustration, and not limitation. FIGS. 57A<br>
and 57B show flowcharts for making a die frame, according to example<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Further embodiments for the die frame<br><br>
of the present invention, and for making the die frame of the present invention,<br>
will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts based on the following<br>
discussion. Furthermore, FIGS. 66 and 68A-B show example flowcharts for<br>
transferring dies using a die frame, according to example embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Further embodiments for transferring dies using the die<br>
frame of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the<br>
relevant arts based on the discussion herein.<br>
FIG. 57A shows a flowchart 5700 providing example steps for making<br>
a die frame, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Flowchart<br>
5700 will be described below in relation to FIGS. 58-63, for illustrative<br>
purposes. Flowchart 5700 begins with step 5702. In step 5702, a ring shaped<br>
groove is formed in a first surface of a wafer around a plurality of dies formed<br>
in the first surface of the wafer. For example, FIG. 58 shows an example<br>
wafer 5800. As shown in FIG. 58, a ring shaped groove 5802 has been formed<br>
in a surface of wafer 5800 closely adjacent to an outer edge of wafer 5800.<br>
For example, the depth of ring shaped groove 5802 may be approximately<br>
equal to the thickness of an integrated circuit die, such as die 104, that is<br>
formed in the surface of wafer 5800 (not shown in FIG. 58). In the example of<br>
FIG. 58, ring shaped groove 5802 is substantially round or elliptical, and is<br>
continuous. In alternative embodiments, ring shaped groove 5802 may be<br>
formed in other shapes, including square or other polygon. Furthermore, ring<br>
shaped groove 5802 does not necessarily have to be continuous, as shown in<br>
the example of FIG. 58, but may be instead be non-continuous, and for<br>
example, may include two or more separate portions formed in the surface of<br>
wafer 5800.<br>
In step 5704, the first surface of the wafer is scribed to form a grid of<br>
grooves in the first surface of the wafer that separates the plurality of dies. For<br>
example, FIG. 59 shows wafer 5800 after having been scribed. The scribing<br>
of wafer 5800 has created a grid 5902 in the surface of wafer 5800. Grid 5902<br>
is formed from a plurality of horizontal and vertical grooves 5904 formed in<br>
the surface of wafer 5800. For example, a first groove 5904A, a second<br><br>
groove 5904B, a third groove 5904C, and a fourth groove 5904D of grid 5902<br>
are indicated in FIG. 59. Within grid 5902 resides a plurality of areas of the<br>
surface of wafer 5800 in which dies 104 may reside. For example, FIG. 59<br>
shows an area for a first die 104a and an area for a second die 104b that reside<br>
within grid 5902. Note that features of dies 104 are not shown in FIG. 58 and<br>
FIG. 59.<br>
FIG. 60 shows a cross sectional view of a portion of wafer 5800. As<br>
shown in FIG. 60, ring shaped groove 5802 and grooves 5904a and 5904b<br>
have a thickness or depth of depth 6002. For example, depth 6002 may be 100<br>
micrometers, or other thickness. Depth 6002 is typically equal to or greater<br>
than a thickness of a die of wafer 5800. As shown in FIG. 60, wafer 6004 has<br>
a thickness 6004. Thickness 6004 can be any thickness of a conventional or<br>
special purpose wafer, which may be 600 to 700 micrometers or other<br>
thickness, for example.<br>
In step 5706, a solidifiable material is applied to the first surface of the<br>
wafer to substantially fill the ring shaped groove and the grooves of the grid.<br>
FIG. 61 shows, for example, a solidifiable material 6102 that has been applied<br>
to the surface of wafer 5800 to substantially fill ring shaped groove 5802 and<br>
grooves 5904 of grid 5902. Solidifiable material 6102 substantially fills ring<br>
shaped groove 6102 and grooves 5904. For example, solidifiable material<br>
6102 may fill the grooves to a level below the surface of wafer 5800, to the<br>
same level as the surface of wafer 5800 (as shown in FIG. 62), or even to<br>
slightly protrude above the surface of wafer 5800. Solidifiable material 6102<br>
may be a polymer, epoxy, resin, urethane, glass, or other material, for<br>
example.<br>
A variety of processes may be used to cause solidifiable material 6102<br>
to fill grooves 5802 and 5904 when applied to wafer 5800, without leaving a<br>
substantial excess amount of solidifiable material 6102 otherwise on the<br>
surface of wafer 5800. For example, a vacuum source may be applied to the<br>
opposite surface of wafer 5800, or to a tape, such as a blue or green tape, to<br>
which wafer 5800 is attached, to cause solidifiable material. 6102 to be pulled<br><br>
into grooves 5802 and 5904. In another embodiment, a gas source may direct<br>
a gas towards the surface of wafer 5800 to which solidifiable material 6102 is<br>
being applied, to blow, force, or push solidifiable material 6102 into grooves<br>
5802 and 5904. In another embodiment, solidifiable material 6102 is applied<br>
to the surface of wafer 5800 in a spin-coating fashion, such that a spinning<br>
motion of wafer 5800 causes solidifiable material 6102 to move or "wick" into<br>
grooves 5802 and 5904. Solidifiable material 6102: may be applied in<br>
additional ways to fill grooves 5802 and 5904, including by "squeegee"<br>
application, spraying, vapor deposition, physical deposition, or chemical<br>
deposition.<br>
In step 5708, the solidifiable material is caused to harden into a ring<br>
shaped hardened material in the ring shaped groove, and into a grid shaped<br>
hardened material in the grooves of the grid to form the die frame. For<br>
instance, in the example of FIGS. 61 and 62, solidifiable material 6102 is<br>
caused to hardened in ring shaped groove 5802, and in grooves 5904 of grid<br>
5902. In an embodiment, the hardened material is formed by causing<br>
solidifiable material 6102 to hardened by a curing process. Hence, solidifiable<br>
material 6102 may be any curable material, such as a curable polymer, epoxy,<br>
resin, urethane, glass, or other material, for example. Solidifiable material<br>
6102 may be a material that is caused to harden in a variety of ways, including<br>
by heat, by allowing a sufficient amount of time for solidifiable material 6102<br>
to hardened on its own, by applying light, or by other ways described<br>
elsewhere herein or otherwise known.<br>
in step 5710, the wafer is thinned such that the grid shaped hardened<br>
material removably holds the plurality of dies. For example, FIG. 63 shows a<br>
die frame 6300 formed according to the present invention. Die frame 6300<br>
includes a hardened material 6304 resulting from the hardening of solidifiable<br>
material 6102 in ring shaped groove 5802 and grooves 5904 of grid 5902, as<br>
described above. Die frame 6300 further results from the thinning of wafer<br>
5800. As shown in FIG. 63, wafer 5800 has been thinned to form die frame<br>
6300 of a thickness of approximately depth 6002. In embodiments, die frame<br><br>
6300 can be formed or thinned to have a thickness of approximately equal to<br>
depth 6002, or a lesser thickness. Thus, because die frame 6300 has a<br>
thickness approximately equal to or less than depth 6002, die frame 6300<br>
removably holds dies 104 in corresponding openings 6302. In other words,<br>
dies 104 can be easily removed from openings 6302. For example, as shown<br>
in FIG. 63, die frame 6300 removably holds die 104A in opening 6302A, and<br>
removably holds die 104B in an opening 6302B. Die frame 6300 provides a<br>
support structure in the shape of ring shaped groove 5802 and grid 5904 that is<br>
capable of removably holding dies 104 in openings 6302. Dies 104 may be<br>
removed from die frame 6300 by pushing, poking, or otherwise forcing them<br>
out of openings 6302 from either surface of die frame 6300 onto another<br>
surface. Depending on which surface of die frame 6300 that dies 104 are<br>
forced from will determine whether dies 104 are transferred to a surface in<br>
either a pads up or a pads down orientation.<br>
Note that wafer 5800 may be thinned in step 5710 according to any<br>
conventional or otherwise known means. Furthermore, note that solidifiable<br>
material 6102 is selected so that it does not substantially adhere to die 104, so<br>
that dies 104 may be easily removed from die frame 6300 and are thus<br>
removably held therein.<br>
FIG. 57B shows a flowchart 5720 providing example steps for making<br>
a die frame, according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Flowchart 5720 will be described below in relation to FIGS. 64A-64C, 65A,<br>
and 65B, for illustrative purposes. Flowchart 5720 begins with step 5722. In<br>
step 5722, a wafer attached to an adhesive surface is scribed such that a<br>
resulting plurality of dies are separated by a grid of grooves that extend<br>
through the wafer to the adhesive surface. For example, FIG. 64A shows a<br>
scribed wafer 6402 attached to an adhesive surface 6404. Adhesive surface<br>
6404 is held in a wafer frame 6406. Wafer frame 6406 may also be referred to<br>
as a wafer carrier or tape ring. For example, adhesive surface 6404 may be a<br>
green tape, blue tape, or other adhesive surface type. Wafer frame 6406 holds<br>
and supports adhesive surface 6404 in a taut fashion so that scribed wafer<br><br>
6402 may be accessed. Because wafer 6402 has been scribed, wafer 6402 has<br>
a grid 5902 of grooves 5904 (not shown in FIG. 64A) that separates the dies<br>
104 of wafer 6402. Wafer 6402 is scribed so that grooves 5904 extend<br>
through wafer 6402 to adhesive surface 6404. Hence, dies 104 of wafer 6402<br>
are individually attached to adhesive surface 6404. FIG. 64B shows a cross-<br>
sectional view of an example scribed wafer 6402 having three dies 104<br>
separated by grooves 5904. Note that wafer 6402 is shown with three dies 104<br>
for purposes of illustration, and not of limitation. FIG. 64C shows a<br>
perspective view of a portion of an example scribed wafer 6402 attached to<br>
adhesive surface 6404, having a plurality of dies 104 separated by grooves<br>
5904 of grid 5902.<br>
In step 5724, a solidifiable material is applied to the scribed wafer to<br>
substantially fill the grooves of the grid. For example, as shown in FIG. 65 A,<br>
solidifiable material 6102 is applied to scribed wafer 6402 to partially or<br>
completely fill grooves 5904 between dies 104. As shown in FIG. 65A,<br>
solidifiable material 6102a fills grooves 5904 between dies 104. In an<br>
embodiment, solidifiable material 6102 may be applied such that solidifiable<br>
material 6102b is present to fill a space 6500 on adhesive surface 6404<br>
between an outer edge 6502 of wafer 6402 and an inner edge 6504 of wafer<br>
frame 6406. Note that in an embodiment, solidifiable material 6102 may even<br>
extend partially within wafer frame 6406, as shown in FIG. 65A, although this<br>
is not required. Solidifiable material 6102 may be applied in any manner<br>
described elsewhere herein, such as is described above in relation to FIGS. 61<br>
and 62, or otherwise known.<br>
In step 5726, the solidifiable material is caused to harden into a grid<br>
shaped hardened material in the grooves of the grid. For example, solidifiable<br>
material 6102a and 6102b shown in FIG. 65A is caused to harden into a grid<br>
shaped hardened material, such as is described above for hardened material<br>
6304 in relation to FIG. 63.<br>
In step 5728, the adhesive surface is removed so that the grid shaped<br>
hardened material removably holds the plurality of dies. For example, FIG.<br><br>
65B shows a die frame 6300 that results from the removal of adhesive surface<br>
6404. Hardened material 6304a is present between dies 104, and hardened<br>
material 6304b is present outside of dies 104. Hardened material 6304<br>
removably holds dies 104 in the shape of a grid in die frame 6300, as<br>
described above. Note that adhesive surface 6404 may be removed or<br>
detached by peeling, chemically dissolving, or otherwise removing it from die<br>
frame 6300.<br>
Note that die frame 6300 may be formed in a pads up or pads down<br>
fashion. For example, flowchart 5720 may include steps similar to steps 702,<br>
704, and 706 shown in flowchart 700 of FIG. 7, for flipping the orientation of<br>
dies 104 prior to performance of step 5722. Thus, the pads of dies 104 may be<br>
facing toward or away from adhesive surface 6404, depending on which<br>
orientation is selected.<br>
The structure of die frame 6300 has numerous advantages. For<br>
example, the portion of die frame 6300 formed in a ring shape in ring shaped<br>
groove 5802 allows for a holding mechanism, such as a clamp or jig, to<br>
reliably hold die frame 6300 when being used for transferring dies, for<br>
example. The portion of die frame 6300 formed in a grid shape in grid 5904<br>
allows for the holding of dies 104, with relative ease in removal of dies 104, as<br>
described below. The structure of die frame 6300 has further benefits. Note<br>
that in some embodiments, the ring shaped portion of die frame 6300 may not<br>
be necessary, and is not present.<br>
Preferably, excess solidifiable material 6102 is not left on the surface<br>
of wafer 5800. In embodiments, flowchart 5700 may include an additional<br>
step that is performed prior to step 5704, where a layer of protective material<br>
is applied onto the surface of the wafer. The protective material, for example,<br>
may be a photo-resist material, or other protective material, which may be spin<br>
coated or otherwise applied to the surface of the wafer. Thus, in an<br>
embodiment, flowchart 5700 may also include the step where the protective<br>
material is removed from the surface of the wafer. For example, removing the<br>
protective material from the wafer can cause the removal of excess solidifiable<br><br>
material 6102 in its hardened state or in its unhardened state (i.e., prior to or<br>
after step 5708). For example, wafer 5800 may be immersed in a solvent, or<br>
may have a solvent applied thereto to dissolve the protective material from the<br>
surface of wafer 5800. The protective material may be removed from 5800 by<br>
other ways that are known to persons skilled in the relevant arts.<br>
Die frame 6300 may be used to transfer dies 104 to a subsequent<br>
destination or transfer surface. The subsequent surface can be an intermediate<br>
surface, such as a blue or green tape, or intermediate surfaces otherwise<br>
known or described elsewhere herein, or may be used to transfer dies 104 to a<br>
final destination surface, such as a substrate. Furthermore, die frame 6300<br>
allows for precise transfer of dies. For example, because the location of dies<br>
removably held in die frame 6300 is accurately known, precise registration of<br>
dies is present. Thus, expensive optical and/or other type registration systems<br>
may not be required to locate and accurately place dies.<br>
FIG. 66 shows a flowchart 6600 providing steps for transferring a<br>
plurality of dies to a surface using a die frame, according to embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Note that steps of flowchart 6600 that are optional are<br>
shown enclosed in dotted lines. Flowchart 6600 will be described in relation<br>
to FIG. 67, for illustrative purposes. Further structural embodiments will be<br>
apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts based on the following<br>
discussion.<br>
Flowchart 6600 begins with step 6602. In step 6602, a die frame is<br>
positioned closely to a surface of a substrate tape that includes a plurality of<br>
substrates such that a die of a plurality of dies removably held in the die frame<br>
is closely adjacent to a corresponding substrate of the plurality of substrates of<br>
the substrate tape. For example, FIG. 67 shows a system 6700 for transferring<br>
dies to a surface using die frame 6300. System 6700 includes die frame 6300,<br>
punching member 2406, a die frame jig 6702, a first reel 6706, a second reel<br>
6708, and a substrate tape 6710. As shown in FIG. 67, substrate tape 6710<br>
includes a plurality of substrates 6712a-c. Substrate tape 6710 may include<br>
any number of substrates 6712. As shown in FIG. 67, die frame 6300 is<br><br>
positioned closely adjacent to a surface of substrate tape 6710. Die frame<br>
6300 is positioned closely adjacent to substrate tape 6710 such that a die 104<br>
may be punched from die frame 6300 to a substrate 6712 of substrate tape<br>
6710, as is described below.<br>
In step 6604, the die is transferred onto the closely adjacent<br>
corresponding substrate from the die frame. As shown in FIG. 67, die 104 has<br>
been transferred from die frame 6300 to a surface of substrate 6712b of<br>
substrate tape 6710. For example, as shown in FIG. 67, die 104 may be<br>
punched from die frame 6300, which removably holds die 104, onto substrate<br>
6712a. For example, a punching mechanism 2406 may be used to punch die<br>
104 from die frame 6300 onto substrate 6712a. In further embodiments, other<br>
mechanisms may be used to transfer die 104 from die frame 6300 to a<br>
substrate 6712.<br>
Multiple dies may be transferred from die frame 6300 to substrate tape<br>
6710 in this manner. In step 6606, the substrate tape is incremented. For<br>
instance, as shown in the example of FIG. 67, substrate tape 6710 may include<br>
a plurality of substrates 6712 that are serially arranged. Substrate tape 6710<br>
may be incremented according to a reel-to-reel system, such as shown in FIG.<br>
67. In FIG. 67, a first reel 6706 may supply substrate tape 6710 to a second<br>
reel 6708, which receives substrate tape 6710. By turning first and second<br>
reels 6706 and 6708, substrate tape 6710 may be incremented to move a next<br>
substrate 6712 into position to receive a die 104 from die frame 6300. Other<br>
mechanisms may be used to increment substrate tape 6710. Furthermore, in<br>
alternative embodiments, substrate tape may include an N x M array of<br>
substrates 6712, where N &gt; 1 and M &gt; 1, instead of having substrates 6712<br>
serially aligned.<br>
In step 6608, the die frame is positioned closely adjacent to the surface<br>
of the substrate tape such that another die of a plurality of dies removably held<br>
in the die frame is closely adjacent to a next corresponding substrate of the<br>
plurality of substrates of the substrate tape. For example, shown in FIG. 67,<br>
die frame 6300 is held in a die frame jig 6702. Die frame jig 6702 may be<br><br>
moved laterally relative to substrate tape 6710 to position the next die 104<br>
over the next substrate 6712, such as substrate 6712a or 6712b. Because the<br>
size of a die 104 is well known, the die frame jig 6702 may be repositioned by<br>
the width or length of a die 104, instead being repositioned by an optical<br>
and/or other registration system type which has to determine the location of a<br>
die. For example, in an embodiment, for a 500 x 500 micron sized die, die<br>
frame jig 6702 may be moved by 500 microns (possibly plus the width of a<br>
groove 5904) to place the next die 104 into position for transfer. Note that the<br>
present invention is applicable to any size die.<br>
In step 6610, another die is transferred onto the closely adjacent next<br>
corresponding substrate from the die frame. Thus, in this manner a plurality<br>
of dies 104 may be transferred from die frame 6300 on to corresponding<br>
substrates 6712 of substrate tape 6710. In this manner, for example, a large<br>
number of tag substrate/die combinations may be created in a relatively rapid<br>
fashion, in fewer steps than with conventional processes.<br>
Note that multiple die frames 6300 may be placed in a stack, from<br>
which dies 104 may be transferred to a destination surface. The dies 104 may<br>
be transferred from the stack of die frames 6300 to the destination surface<br>
using a punching mechanism, a vacuum/gas source, and any other mechanism<br>
described elsewhere herein or otherwise known. For example, FIG. 68A<br>
shows a flowchart 6800 providing steps for transferring a plurality of dies to a<br>
surface using a stack of die frames, according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Note that steps of flowchart 6800 that are optional are<br>
shown enclosed in dotted lines. Further structural embodiments will be<br>
apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts based on the following<br>
discussion.<br>
Flowchart 6800 will be described in relation to FIG. 69, for illustrative<br>
purposes. Flowchart 6800 begins with step 6802. In step 6802, a stack of die<br>
frames is formed, each die frame including a grid having a plurality of<br>
rectangular openings, wherein each opening of the plurality of rectangular<br>
openings removably holds a die, wherein corresponding rectangular openings<br><br>
of the die frames in the stack are aligned in a column to form a plurality of<br>
columns of openings. For example, FIG. 69 shows a stack of die frames 6902.<br>
Stack 6902 includes a plurality of die frames 6300. For illustrative purposes,<br>
stack 6902 is shown including six die frames 6300a-f, but may include any<br>
number of two or more die frames 6300. As described above, each die frame<br>
6300 includes hardened material 6304 shaped in the form of grid 5902. A<br>
plurality of openings 6302 are present in each die frame 6300, each removably<br>
holding a die 104. Die frames 6300 are aligned so that corresponding<br>
openings 6302 form columns in the stack 6902 (not shown in FIG. 69).<br>
In step 6804, a die removably held in an opening is transferred from at<br>
least one column of the plurality of columns to the destination surface. In<br>
other words, one or more dies 104 are transferred from stack 6902 from one or<br>
more columns to the destination surface. Dies 104 may be transferred in<br>
numerous ways from stack 6902. For example, as shown in FIG. 69, one or<br>
more punching members 2406 may be applied to corresponding columns of<br>
openings 6302 in stack 6902. A punching member 2406 pushes through stack<br>
6902 to move dies 104 from the respective column of openings 6302 in stack<br>
6902 to the destination surface. A punching member 2406 may be stepped to<br>
push out a single die 104 at a time. Any number of punching members 2406<br>
may operate in parallel, such as punching members 2406a-c as shown in the<br>
example of FIG. 69, to increase the rate of die transfer.<br>
Other processes for transferring dies 104 from stack 6902 may be used,<br>
including the use of a gas or vacuum source to apply gas pressure, electrostatic<br>
force, pick and place devices, and processes described elsewhere herein, or<br>
otherwise known. Another example such process is described in detail below<br>
with respect to FIG. 68B.<br>
Note that the destination surface may be a substrate tape or structure,<br>
as shown in FIG. 69. Alternatively, the destination surface may be a punch<br>
tape or chip carrier, such as shown in FIG. 22, any intermediate surface, such<br>
as a green tape or blue tape, or any other surface. Furthermore, dies 104 may<br>
be transferred to the destination surface in a pads up or down configuration,<br><br>
depending on the orientation of stack 6902. Stack 6902: may be inserted into a<br>
die deposition apparatus that holds and aligns the respective die frames 6300<br>
in a stack, and allows dies to be transferred therefrom.<br>
Further detail for an example embodiment of flowchart 6800 is shown<br>
in FIG. 68B. FIG. 68B will be described in relation to FIG. 70, for illustrative<br>
purposes. FIG. 70 shows a system 7000 for transferring dies from a die frame<br>
6300 using a multi-barrel die transfer apparatus 4802, according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 70, multi-barrel die<br>
transfer apparatus 4802 includes a plurality of barrels 4806a-c. Furthermore,<br>
system 7000 includes a stack 6902 of die frames 6300 which includes first,<br>
second, third, and fourth die frames 6300a-d. Stack 6902 may include any<br>
number of die frames 6300.<br>
In step 6802, a stack of die frames is formed, each die frame including<br>
a grid having a plurality of rectangular openings, wherein each opening of the<br>
plurality of rectangular openings removably holds a die, wherein<br>
corresponding openings of the die frames in the stack are aligned in a column.<br>
As shown in FIG. 70, for example, the die frames 630()a-d of die frame stack<br>
6902 are aligned such that a plurality of columns 7002 are formed. Each<br>
column 7002 includes a die removably held in an opening in each of die<br>
frames 6300a-d.<br>
In step 6812, each hollow barrel of a plurality of hollow barrels is<br>
applied to a respective column of openings of the stack of die frames. For<br>
example, as shown in FIG. 70, a first column 7002a has first barrel 4806a<br>
applied thereto, a second column 7002b has second barrel 4806b applied<br>
thereto, and a third column 7002c has a third barrel 4806c applied thereto.<br>
In step 6814, dies removably held in the openings of the respective<br>
column of openings are caused to move into each hollow barrel in parallel. As<br>
shown in FIG. 70, dies 104 that were removably held in die frames 6300a-<br>
6300d are caused to move into barrels 4806. Dies 104 may be caused to move<br>
into the hollow barrels 4806 by vacuum, by gas pressure, by mechanical<br>
means, or other means described elsewhere herein or otherwise known.<br><br>
In step 6816, steps 6812 and 6814 are repeated until each hollow barrel<br>
contains a stack of dies of a predetermined number. For example, steps 6812<br>
and 6814 may be repeated until one or more of barrels 4806a-c become full,<br>
until stack 6902 is depleted of dies, or when an arbitrary number of dies 104<br>
have been moved from stack 6902.<br>
In step 6818, a die from each hollow barrel is deposited onto the<br>
surface until the stack of dies contained by each hollow barrel is substantially<br>
depleted. Thus, dies 104 from hollow barrels 4806 may be deposited onto the<br>
destination or target surface, until the dies 104 in hollow barrels 4806 are<br>
depleted, or until the surface is full of dies 104, or until an arbitrary number of<br>
dies 104 have been transferred. As described above, dies 104 may be<br>
deposited from hollow barrels 4806 by mechanical means, by vacuum, by gas<br>
pressure or by other means described elsewhere herein or otherwise known.<br>
Hence, die frame 6300 may be used in a variety of ways to transfer<br>
dies to a target surface. Furthermore, die frame 6300 may be combined with<br>
any of the other die transfer mechanisms and processes described elsewhere<br>
herein to provide for enhanced die transfer mechanisms and processes.<br>
Further example die frame embodiments are described in the following<br>
subsections, for illustrative purposes.<br>
2.1.4.1	Die Frame Formed in a Tape Structure<br>
In an embodiment, a die frame may be formed in a flexible, planar tape<br>
structure, similar to a "blue tape" or "green tape" used to attach wafers/dies.<br>
The tape structure is fabricated to include a hardenable material or substance.<br>
A wafer is attached to the tape structure, and is separated into a plurality of<br>
dies. The tape structure is processed to cause a hardened grid structure to<br>
form in the tape structure, which removably holds the plurality of dies. FIG.<br>
71 shows a flowchart 7100 providing steps for making such a die frame or die<br>
support frame, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Flowchart 7100 is described below in relation to FIGS. 72, 73A, 73B, and 74<br>
for illustrative purposes.<br><br>
Flowchart 7100 begins with step 7102. In stop 7102, a wafer that<br>
comprises a plurality of dies is attached to a surface of a tape structure. For<br>
example, as described above, FIG. 4B shows a wafer 400 attached to an<br>
example support surface 404. As shown in FIG. 4A, wafer 400 includes a<br>
plurality of dies 104. In the present embodiment, wafer 400 is attached in a<br>
similar fashion to a tape structure. The surface of the tape structure and/or<br>
wafer 400 may have an adhesive material applied thereon to adhere wafer 400<br>
to the tape structure. The tape structure is described in further detail below.<br>
In step 7104, a grid of grooves is formed in the wafer to separate the<br>
plurality of dies on the surface of the tape structure. For example, FIG. 72<br>
shows wafer 400 attached to a surface 7202 of a tape structure 7200, according<br>
to an example embodiment of the present invention. Wafer 400 is separated<br>
into a plurality of dies 104 on surface 7202. Wafer 400 may be separated into<br>
a plurality of dies 104 on tape structure 7200 according to any conventional<br>
wafer separation technique, including scribing or separating wafer 400 by<br>
sawing, laser, mechanical or chemical etching, and other techniques. The<br>
separation of wafer 400 creates grid 5902 of grooves 5904 in wafer 400.<br>
Tape structure 7200 is a flexible structure that comprises a hardening<br>
or solidifiable material that can be caused to harden by various techniques.<br>
For example, tape structure 7200 may include a material that can be caused to<br>
harden by the application of light, including by application of ultraviolet (UV)<br>
or other frequency bands of light. Alternatively, tape structure 7200 may<br>
include a material that may be caused to harden by the application of a solid,<br>
liquid, or gas, that reacts with the material of tape structure 7200 to cause<br>
portions of tape structure 7200 to harden or solidify.<br>
All or a portion of tape structure 7200 may comprise the material that<br>
can be caused to harden. For example, FIG. 73 A shows a cross-sectional view<br>
of tape structure 7200 as a single layer stracture having the solidifiable or<br>
hardenable material throughout. Alternatively, FIG. 73B shows tape structure<br>
7200 as a multi-layer structure that includes a solidifiable or hardenable<br>
material layer 7302. Layer 7302 can be fabricated into tape structure 7200, or<br><br>
can be spread, applied, or sprayed onto tape structure 7200. For example, the<br>
solidifiable or hardenable material may be a photoresist material or an epoxy<br>
applied to tape structure 7200. Tape structure 7200 may further include a<br>
paper, tape, polymer, or other material layer to provide structural support.<br>
Note that steps 7102 and 7104 may be performed by structure(s)<br>
described herein or otherwise known, and may be performed by the same<br>
structure, or different structures. For example, a wafer preparation module<br>
may perform steps 7102 and 7104. An example such wafer preparation<br>
module is further described in sections 3.0-3.2 below. The wafer preparation<br>
module may include a wafer application apparatus, for applying a wafer to<br>
tape structure 7200, and/or may include a wafer singulation apparatus for<br>
separating/singulating the wafer on surface 7202.<br>
In step 7106, a portion of the tape structure that is accessible through<br>
the grooves of the grid is caused to harden into a grid shaped structure. For<br>
example, FIG. 74 shows an example system 7400 for causing the portion of<br>
tape structure 7200 that is accessible through grooves 5904 of grid 5902 to<br>
harden into a grid shaped structure. As shown in FIG. 74, a hardening agent<br>
source 7402 transmits a hardening agent 7404 towards separated wafer 400<br>
and tape structure 7200. Due to the location of dies 104, hardening agent 7404<br>
reaches tape structure 7200 through grooves 5904 and at peripheral areas.<br>
Thus, portions of tape structure 7200 that are accessible through grooves 5904<br>
and in peripheral areas are caused to harden, shown as hardened groove<br>
portions 7410 and hardened peripheral areas 7420, respectively. Portions of<br>
tape structure 7200 that are not accessible to hardening agent 7404 (due to the<br>
application of hardening agent 7404 being blocked by dies 104) do not harden.<br>
For example, FIG. 74 shows an example portion 7430 of tape structure 7200<br>
that is not hardened.<br>
Hardening agent source 7402 can include various sources for<br>
hardening agents, depending on the type of hardening or solidifiable material<br>
in tape structure 7200. For example, hardening agent source 7402 can include<br>
a light source and respective optics, including a UV light source or infrared<br><br>
(IR) light source, for a material that hardens with exposure to light. For<br>
example, the hardening material may be a photoresist material. In such an<br>
embodiment, hardening agent 7404 may be light, such as UV, IR, or other<br>
frequency band of light<br>
Alternatively, hardening agent source 7402 can include a gas or liquid<br>
supply for applying or spraying a gas or liquid towards separated wafer 400<br>
and tape structure 7200. For example, hardening agent 7404 may be an epoxy<br>
of a two-party epoxy, to react with a corresponding epoxy incorporated in tape<br>
structure 7200. Other hardening agent sources and hardening agents are<br>
applicable to the present invention, including a heat source.<br>
A die frame 7460 is thereby formed. The die frame 7460 formed<br>
according to flowchart 7100 removably holds the plurality of dies 104. Thus,<br>
one or more dies 104 of the plurality of dies 104 can be moved from the grid<br>
shaped structure of die frame 7460 onto a target surface. FIG. 75 shows a die<br>
frame 7460 that includes an example grid shaped structure 7500. Die frame<br>
7460 is held by a die frame jig 6702. As shown in FIG. 75, a die 104 is being<br>
moved from die frame 7460 to a substrate 6712. In the example of FIG. 75,<br>
die 104 is being moved by a punching member 2406. Die 104 may be moved<br>
from die frame 7460 in a variety of ways, including by punching, by action of<br>
a gas, and by other ways otherwise known or described elsewhere herein.<br>
Note that each non-hardened area 7430 may or may not tear from die<br>
frame 7460 when the respective die 104 is moved from die frame 7460.<br>
Die frame 7460 may be used in a variety of ways to transfer dies 104<br>
to a target surface, including any of the ways for transferring dies described<br>
elsewhere herein. Furthermore, die frame 7460 may be combined with any of<br>
the other die transfer mechanisms and processes described elsewhere herein to<br>
provide for enhanced die transfer mechanisms and processes.<br><br>
2.1.4.2	Die Frame Formed by Releasing Encapsulated<br>
Hardenable Material<br>
In an embodiment, a die frame may be formed on a planar tape<br>
structure, similar to a "blue tape" or "green tape" used to attach wafers/dies.<br>
The tape structure is fabricated to include an encapsulated, releasable material<br>
or substance that hardens. A wafer is attached to the tape structure, and is<br>
separated into a plurality of dies. The process of separating the wafer into dies<br>
breaches the tape structure, which releases the encapsulated material. The<br>
released material hardens to create a hardened grid structure on the tape<br>
structure, which removably holds the plurality of dies. The remainder of the<br>
tape structure may then be optionally removed. FIG. 76 shows a flowchart<br>
7600 providing steps for making such a die frame or die support frame,<br>
according to an another example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Flowchart 7600 will be described below in relation to FIGS. 77-82, for<br>
illustrative purposes.<br>
Flowchart 7600 begins with step 7602. In step 7602, a wafer that<br>
comprises a plurality of dies is attached to a surface of a tape structure,<br>
wherein the tape structure comprises an encapsulated releasable hardening or<br>
hardenable material. For example, as described above, FIG. 4B shows wafer<br>
400 attached to an example support surface 404. As shown in FIG. 4A, wafer<br>
400 includes a plurality of dies 104. In the present embodiment, wafer 400 is<br>
similarly attached to a tape structure. However, in the current embodiment,<br>
the tape structure comprises an encapsulated hardening or solidifiable material<br>
that can be released and hardened.<br>
For example, FIG. 77 shows wafer 400 attached to a surface 7706 of a<br>
tape structure 7702. Surface 7706 and/or wafer 400 may have an adhesive<br>
material applied thereto to adhere wafer 400 to surface 7706.<br>
Tape structure 7702 may be a single or multi-layer structure. An<br>
example multi-layer structure for tape structure 7702 is shown in FIG. 77. As<br>
shown in FIG. 77, tape structure 7702 includes a layer 7704. Layer 7704<br>
comprises an encapsulated hardening material that can be released and<br><br>
hardened. For example, layer 7704 may include a gas, liquid, or solid that is<br>
released from layer 7704, and hardens, when a proper agent is applied to layer<br>
7704. The operation and structure of layer 7704 is further described below.<br>
Tape structure 7702 is typically flexible, but may also be rigid. As<br>
shown in the example embodiment of FIG. 77, tape structure 7702 can include<br>
a tape layer 7708 for added structural support, although tape layer 7708 is not<br>
required. Tape layer 7708 may be made from a variety of materials. For<br>
example, tape layer 7708 may be a paper, a polymer, a substrate material, a<br>
glass, a metal or combination of metals/alloy, a plastic, or other suitable<br>
substance, or combination thereof.<br>
In step 7604, a grid of grooves in the wafer is formed to separate the<br>
plurality of dies on the surface of the tape structure, including the step of<br>
breaching the surface of the tape structure in the grooves to cause the<br>
encapsulated hardening material to harden in the grooves into a grid shaped<br>
hardened material in the grooves of the grid. For example, FIG. 78 shows a<br>
cross-sectional view of wafer 400 being separated into separate dies 104 on<br>
surface 7706 of tape structure 7702, according to an example embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The separation of wafer 400 creates grid 5902 of<br>
grooves 5904 (similarly to as shown in FIG. 59).<br>
Wafer 400 may be separated into a plurality of dies 104 on tape<br>
structure 7702 according to any conventional wafer separation technique,<br>
including scribing or separating wafer 400 by sawing, laser, mechanical or<br>
chemical etching, and other techniques. For example, FIG. 78 shows a cross-<br>
sectional view of wafer 400 being separated into a plurality of dies 104 using a<br>
laser 7810, according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 79<br>
shows a perspective view of a portion of wafer 400 being separated into a<br>
plurality of dies 104 using a saw 7910, according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
As recited in step 7604, forming the grid of grooves breaches the<br>
surface of the tape structure in the grooves to cause the encapsulated<br>
hardening material to harden in the grooves into a grid shaped hardened<br><br>
material. For example, as shown in each of FIGS. 78 and 79, surface 7706 of<br>
tape structure 7702 is breached. An example breach in surface 7706 is<br>
indicated as a breach 7820. A sufficient breach 7820 occurs in surface 7706<br>
along the length of each of grooves 5904 so that the encapsulated hardening<br>
material substantially fills each groove 5904. Breach 7820 may have any<br>
width and depth necessary to release a sufficient amount of encapsulated<br>
hardening material. Depending on the particular separation technique used to<br>
create a breach 7820, the respective breach 7820 may be an opening, a tear, a<br>
rupture, or a scratch in surface 7706.<br>
FIGS. 78 and 79 each show a released hardening material 7802 that<br>
partially or completely fills a respective groove 5904. Breach 7820 releases<br>
hardening material 7802 from layer 7704 of tape structure 7702. Hardening<br>
material 7802 can be a gas, liquid, solid, or combination thereof. For example,<br>
the material encapsulated in layer 7704 may be released as a foam, gel, epoxy,<br>
or other liquid. Hardening material 7802 may be caused to harden in a variety<br>
of ways. For example, in an embodiment, hardening material 7802 hardens<br>
when it meets the ambient air, or when it meets a selected gas or combination<br>
of gases. In another embodiment, hardening material 7802 hardens when it is<br>
heated by the particular wafer separation technique, such as the heat generated<br>
by contact with the beam of laser 7810 or by the action of saw 7910. In<br>
another embodiment, hardening material 7802 hardens when it contacts or<br>
mixes with an epoxy or other material.<br>
In another embodiment, layer 7704 may include micro-encapsulated<br>
spheres or beads that contain the hardening material. The spheres or beads are<br>
ruptured when the particular wafer separation technique breaches layer 7704.<br>
The hardening material is released from the spheres or beads and, and hardens<br>
when heated, when contacting air or other gas, or otherwise.<br>
FIG. 80 shows a perspective view of a portion of a separated wafer 400<br>
on tape structure 7702, with hardening material 7802 forming a grid shaped<br>
hardened material 8000 around a plurality of dies 104, according to an<br>
example embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Note that steps 7602 and 7604 may be performed by stracture(s)<br>
described herein or otherwise known, and may be performed by the same<br>
structure, or different structures. For example, a wafer preparation module<br>
may perform steps 7602 and 7604. An example such wafer preparation<br>
module is further described in section 3.0-3.2 below.. The wafer preparation<br>
module may include a wafer application apparatus, for applying a wafer to<br>
tape structure 7702, and/or may include a wafer singulation apparatus for<br>
separating/singulating the wafer on surface 7706, and for breaching surface<br>
7706. The wafer singulation apparatus may include laser 7810 and/or saw<br>
7910, for example.<br>
In step 7606, the tape structure is removed so that the grid shaped<br>
hardened material removably holds the plurality of dies. FIG. 81 shows a die<br>
frame 8100 that has been detached from tape structure 7702, according to an<br>
example embodiment of the present invention. Tape stracture 7702 may be<br>
peeled, dissolved, etched, or otherwise removed.<br>
Die frame 8100 is thus formed according to flowchart 7600. Die frame<br>
8100 may be used in a variety of ways to transfer dies to a target surface,<br>
including any of the ways for transferring dies described elsewhere herein.<br>
Furthermore, die frame 8100 may be combined with any of the other die<br>
transfer mechanisms and processes described elsewhere herein to provide for<br>
enhanced die transfer mechanisms and processes.<br>
