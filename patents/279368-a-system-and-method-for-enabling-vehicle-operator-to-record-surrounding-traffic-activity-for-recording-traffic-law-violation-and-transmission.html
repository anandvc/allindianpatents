				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to vehicular traffic monitoring systems, and<br>
specifically to devices used to allow individual drivers to accurately record and report<br>
violations of traffic laws by other drivers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Each year, traffic accidents kill thousands and injure many more. Too many<br>
of these accidents are due to the non-compliance by at least one driver to traffic laws,<br>
including exceeding posted speed limits, not stopping at stop signs, driving without<br>
seatbelts, and running red lights.<br>
Studies show that there is a higher level of compliance with traffic laws and a<br>
correlating drop in traffic accidents when drivers are aware that their driving is being<br>
monitored by persons having the authority to mete out penalties, such as, for example,<br>
police officers. Unfortunately, many jurisdictions are not equipped to provide such<br>
monitoring in quantities that are sufficient to produce consistently positive results.<br>
Rather, the authorities are often reduced to such stop-gap methods as establishing<br>
temporary speed traps or randomly flagging down drivers for breathalyzer tests and<br>
seat belt checks.<br>
Alternatively, automated monitoring devices may be implemented. While<br>
lack of compliance to traffic laws is of enormous concern and any tools that<br>
encourage safer driving habits are beneficial to everyone on the road, these automated<br>
devices are simply not as effective as live monitoring with regard to driver<br>
compliance with traffic laws.<br>
 <br>
Various attempts have been made to provide solutions to this non-compliance<br>
problem, by equipping private vehicles with cameras or other devices for the purpose<br>
of monitoring the activities of an individual driver and vehicle. Illustrative of such<br>
attempts are US2005259151, US2004113763, US5815093, US2003233261,<br>
US2003154009, and JP2005122671. However, these solutions rely on automated<br>
sensor activation and furthermore, are intended for individual use rather than for<br>
recording and monitoring general vehicular traffic activity.<br>
There is a need for a system that enables a driver to create visual records, in<br>
real time, of specific traffic violations that occur around the driver, without distracting<br>
the driver from the primary task of driving, and that further allows each record to be<br>
transmitted to the appropriate reporting authorities.<br>

Referring now in detail to the accompanying drawings, a traffic law violation<br>
recording and transmitting system of the present invention comprises a vehicle-<br>
mounted video camera 20 for recording surrounding traffic activity, a storage device<br>
30 detachably and operatively connected to video camera 20 for storing the recorded<br>
activities, a marking module 40 for manually identifying and marking specific images<br>
and portions of the recorded traffic activities, an editing module 50 for preparing the<br>
marked portions of the recorded traffic activities for transmission, and a transmission<br>
module 60 for transmitting the edited segments of the recorded traffic activities over a<br>
network 70 to the receiving authority's computing system 80. These components are<br>
represented in Figure 3.<br>
A conventional vehicle operator may be a driver who, for example, regularly<br>
commutes to and from a job or is regularly out and about, running errands.<br>
Video camera 20 may be mounted on, for example, the front of a motor<br>
vehicle 10, as described in Figure 1. According to some embodiments, video camera<br>
20 may also or only be mounted on the rear of a motor vehicle 10, as described in<br>
Figure 2, in order to facilitate recording, for example, tailgating activities. According<br>
to some embodiments, video camera 20 may be mounted at the eye level of the driver;<br>
according to other embodiments, video camera 20 may be mounted at another level or<br>
location on motor vehicle 10. According to embodiments, video camera 20 may<br>
record continuously while motor vehicle 10 is in operation.<br>
 <br>
According to some embodiments, video camera 20 is equipped with a wide-<br>
angle lens in order to enable the capture of not only the passing vehicular traffic but<br>
also the concurrent activities of the surrounding environs. By thus including the<br>
context within which each possible violation occurred, the authorities may be able to<br>
assess more accurately the cause, and even the severity, of each possible vehicular<br>
traffic violation.<br>
Video camera 20 is detachably and operatively connected to storage device 30.<br>
The storage device any be any type as known in the art, e.g. hard drive, Flash memory<br>
, ram memory. According to embodiments, the visual records captured by video<br>
camera 20 are automatically stored to storage device 30. Storage device 30 provides<br>
large capacity storage for storing the visual records amassed by video camera 20.<br>
Storage device 30 is capable of storing at least one hour of images. Additionally,<br>
storage device 30 is portable.<br>
a marking module 40 is operatively associated with video camera 20, in order<br>
to mark at least one of the images recorded by video camera 20. Marking module 40<br>
is activated manually by the vehicle operator.<br>
The vehicle operator may activate marking module 40 by use of, for example,<br>
a marking switch 42. According to embodiments, marking switch 42 may be, inter<br>
alia, a toggle switch, a push button switch, a slide switch, a rocker switch, a voice-<br>
activated switch, a rotary switch, or a tactile switch.<br>
According to some embodiments, marking switch 42 may further allow the<br>
operator to modify the aim of video camera 20, for example, tilt the lens left or right.<br>
Marking switch 42 may also or alternatively allow zooming in and out of video<br>
camera 20. According to some other embodiments, there may be an automatic zoom<br>
function.<br>
According to some embodiments, marking module 40 may position an<br>
indicator or mark on a sequential section of the recorded traffic activity, wherein said<br>
mark represents a predetermined period of time prior to and subsequent to the<br>
activation of marking module 40. For example, a beginning mark may be placed at a<br>
location that represents a predefined period of time, for example, five minutes, prior<br>
 <br>
to activation of marking module 40, and an ending mark may be placed at a location<br>
on the sequential images that represents a predefined period of time, for example, five<br>
minutes, after activation of marking module 40. This ensures the identification of the<br>
complete section of recorded video that contains the possible traffic law violation.<br>
The resulting marked portion of the recorded traffic activity contains sufficient<br>
information about the possible traffic law violation for a receiving authority to, for<br>
example, determine whether a traffic law violation occurred. Such information may<br>
include, for example, incidents leading up to the possible traffic law violation and the<br>
like.<br>
An editing module 50 uses the marks placed by marking module 40 in order to<br>
retrieve and prepare the aforementioned marked portions for transmission. Editing<br>
software embedded within editing module 50 enables identification of the required<br>
marked portions according to the marks placed thereon by marking module 40.<br>
According to some embodiments, editing module 50 may further be equipped with a<br>
zoom function that allows for zooming in on specific areas of at least one recorded<br>
image, in order to, for example, capture additional details of an event or object such<br>
as, for example, a license plate number.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, once the driver is<br>
finished recording, he may remove storage device 30 from motor vehicle 10 and<br>
connect storage device 30 to a computer, which is equipped with an editing module<br>
50, for editing.<br>
According to some other embodiments, editing module 50 may be contained<br>
within storage device 30, thereby enabling edits to the recorded video at the time of<br>
recording.<br>
Once the editing is complete, the recording may be transmitted to the<br>
appropriate receiving authority's computing system 80 through a transmission module<br>
60. Transmission module 60 may include, inter alia, a WIFI connection, a cellular<br>
telephone, a conventional internet connection, a wireless internet connection, or other<br>
suitable communication methods.<br>
 <br>
According to some embodiments, where storage device 30 contains an editing<br>
module 50 as described above, the edited video may be automatically transmitted via<br>
a transmission module 60 immediately upon completion of the editing.<br>
In order to more fully describe the present invention, the following describes a<br>
mode of use, with reference being made to Figure 4.<br>
Upon viewing a possible traffic violation, the vehicle operator may activate<br>
marking module 40 by, for example, depressing marking switch 42, in order to mark<br>
at least one of the recorded images as seen in box 100.<br>
A mode of use may further include marking module 40 adding a mark or other<br>
place indicator to a recorded video image, in real-time, for each depression of<br>
marking switch 42 by the vehicle operator, as indicated by box 200.<br>
As described in box 300, a mode of use may also include editing module 50<br>
editing the marked video images into prepared segments in accordance with the<br>
placement of the marks, as described previously.<br>
The prepared segments may then be transmitted by transmission module 60<br>
over a communication network 70 to a receiving authority's computing system 80, as<br>
suggested in box 400.<br>
After analysis by the appropriate personnel and where deemed applicable, said<br>
visual records of a possible traffic law violation may then be used, for example, by<br>
traffic law enforcement persons to assist in effectively addressing the recorded<br>
violation or violations.<br>
According to some embodiments, the present invention may be further<br>
equipped with a location identification module, wherein information reflecting the<br>
location of, for example, motor vehicle 10, is embedded into the recorded images<br>
when, for example, the marking module 40 is activated. Such a location identification<br>
module may utilize, inter alia, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, cellular<br>
telephone triangulation, or other coordinate positioning systems. According to some<br>
embodiments, said location identification module may translate, for example, the<br>
 <br>
recorded longitude and latitude, to a specific location such as, for example, a street<br>
address.<br>
According to some embodiments, vehicle operators may receive a monetary<br>
incentive in return for utilizing the traffic law violation recording and transmitting<br>
system of the present invention.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of<br>
embodiments, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the<br>
invention, but rather as exemplifications of some of the embodiments. Those skilled<br>
in the art will envision other possible variations, modifications, and applications that<br>
are also within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention<br>
should not be limited by what has thus far been described, but by the appended claims<br>
and their legal equivalents. Therefore, it is to be understood that alternatives,<br>
