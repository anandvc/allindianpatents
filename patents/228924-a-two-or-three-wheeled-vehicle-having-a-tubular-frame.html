				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a two or three wheeled vehicalse <br>
having a tubular frame <br>
The present invention refers to a compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles.<br>
It is evident that all traction vehicles feature tanks, such as tanks for the lubrication oil, for fuel in the case of combustion engines, for water if water-cooled etc. This naturally applies to both two-wheeled vehicles and vehicles provided with three, four and more wheels.<br>
Installation of these tanks is often very difficult especially in two and three-wheeled vehicles because the space available is extremely limited and because the arrangement must not alter the look of the vehicle, the tanks being almost always exposed to view. At present, in two and three-wheeled vehicles, in order to attempt to combine the tanks with the bodywork as best as possible, suitably shaped tanks are sometimes produced. At times this results in a rather contorted shape in order to adapt the tank to the vehicle bodywork and match the required look.<br>
In other cases the vehicle frame itself is used to create the tank. In this second case, the tank is made entirely inside the vehicle frame. In this way, there is no actual tank as the tank forms part of the frame. For example,  if  the  frame  is made of box-type or<br><br><br>
tubular elements, these elements (or portions of them) directly constitute the tank. In addition, said closed portion of the frame (tank) is provided with pipe unions, plugs and level/reserve indicators communicating with the outside for filling/emptying (oil, water, fuel).<br>
This solution, although immediate and at first sight economical, has a number of disadvantages. It is difficult, and often not economical, to produce perfectly sealed sheet metal or tubular frame structures or portions. In other words it is not simple and safe to produce tanks designed to contain fluids due to the welding which is inevitably necessary and often has to be performed at points that are difficult to weld; in this regard it should not be forgotten that the frame has a mainly structural function.<br>
Once the tank has been made as above, it is difficult or even impossible to access for inspection and cleaning. In addition, during production, machining scrap, remains of welding etc. can remain inside which cannot be subsequently removed and are therefore hazardous. In fact the tanks are not easy to inspect and to fully empty.<br>
Another factor that should not be neglected is that: in the event of breakage of the frame, which in this solution constitutes the entire tank, due to fracture or simply to detachment of the weld, leakage<br><br>
of the liquid can be dangerous. In fact leakage of the liquid can be dangerous due both to its flammability and to the fact that it can cause pollution due to dispersion in the external environment and on the ground.<br>
Lastly it should also be remembered that when the vehicle is scrapped, the tank cannot be recovered and re-used if necessary as a spare part.<br>
The main aim of the present invention is to solve the above problems, i.e. to eliminate all the disadvantages of the tanks known so far.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to identify a compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles characterised by simple construction with minimum overall dimensions and maximum safety.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a two or three-wheeled vehicle having a tubular frame and a tank provided with an inlet and an outlet, said tank being designed to receive a liquid from said inlet and to deliver the liquid from said outlet, characterized in that said tank is fitted and inserted in a removable way in a hollow portion of said tubular frame through connection/fixing elements, said hollow portion of the tubular frame being provided with an aperture for the insertion of a pipe union for liquid intake in which the inlet also acts as centering hole for positioning of the pipe union in the tank.<br><br>
Another aim of the present invention is to produce a tank arrangement that can be easily replaced, inspected and fitted and/or removed, in or from the vehicle.<br>
Yet another aim is to produce a tank arrangement that can be integrated with the frame.<br>
These and other aims according to the present invention are achieved by producing a compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles as described in claim 1.<br>
The further claims define the additional characteristics of the present invention.<br><br><br>
The characteristics and advantages of a compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles according to the present invention will become clearer from the following description, which is a non-restrictive example, referring to the schematic drawings attached in which:<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles according to the present invention/­Figures 2 to 4 show perspective views of the arrangement of Figure 1 in successive assembly phases and<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of the compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles fully assembled.<br>
With reference to the figures, a compact tank arrangement for two or three-wheeled vehicles is shown consisting essentially of an independent tank 12 provided with an inlet 19 and outlet 15 for a liquid, which is assembled and fixed so that it can be removed inside a portion 13 of hollow tubular frame of the two or three-wheeled vehicle (not shown).<br>
The main characteristic of the invention is that the tank 12 is an independent element, i.e. it is independent from the vehicle frame 13 and can, together with the related frame connection/fixing elements, be freely removed.<br><br>
An arrangement according to the invention comprises, in the non-restrictive example shown, a tank 12, made for example of two half-shells 12a and 12b, separated longitudinally. The lower half-shell 12a is provided with a cross fin 14, designed to prevent the liquid contained in it splashing around, and the above-mentioned outlet 15. Said outlet 15, via which the liquid content of the tank is delivered, can be connected to a filter 16 coupled to a plug 17 with seal, such as an 0-ring for example, fixed by means of an elastic clamp 18. The upper half-shell 12b features, in addition to the inlet 19, which acts also as upper centering hole 19 for positioning of the liquid intake pipe union 20, an upper hole 21 for insertion of a level/reserve indicator 22, connected to the outside by means of an electrical cable 41 connected to an instrument (not shown).<br>
In addition, the upper half-shell 12b is provided at one end with a first fixing bracket 23 provided with a hole 24 linked to an elastic plate 25 and at the other end a second fixing bracket 26. Both the half-shells 12a and 12b are provided with opposing perimeter edges 27 which permit coupling for closing and assembling the tank 12, when made in two parts.<br>
According to the present invention, furthermore, via the new arrangement the portion 13 of the frame in a hollow or tubular area 28 is fitted with the tank 12<br><br>
in such a way that, once assembled, said tank can be removed. For said purpose this frame portion 13 is provided with an end aperture 29 corresponding to a flange 30 provided with hole 31 for combination with the second bracket 26 and connection by screw or other fastening element 32.<br>
Almost corresponding to the other end, connected for example to a steering tube 33, an aperture 34 is located for insertion of the pipe union 20 with respective seals 35. A hole 36 made in the wall of frame portion 13 permits fixing of the pipe union 20 by means of a screw or other fixing element 37, once said pipe union has been inserted into the upper centering hole 19 of the upper half-shell 12b.<br>
It should be noted that said screw or other fixing element 37 of the pipe union 20, when it fits into the hole 36 of frame portion 13, also engages in the hole 24 of the first bracket 23, the elastic plate 25 having been fitted in between, and also determines fixing of the other end of the tank 12. The pipe union 20 is then naturally closed by means of a plug 38.<br>
The frame portion 13 can advantageously be fitted at its ends with fixing brackets 39 and 40 which permit fixing on one side (in 40) of parts of bodywork (not shown) and on the other (in 39, 30) provide a stable fixing point for welding or other connection to the remaining part of the frame, not shown. In this way the<br>
arrangement according to the present invention can be completely assembled and, once assembly has been completed, positioned in a stable fashion inside the frame of the two or three-wheeled vehicle.<br>
Said tank arrangement according to the invention is particularly advantageous as it solves the problems, described above, commonly encountered in existing arrangements.<br>
Furthermore, it has the advantage that it permits optimal fixing of the tank to the frame, with possibility of easy removal if necessary.<br>
Figures 1 to 5 show the elements of the invention and the assembly phases in succession, insertion and fixing in/on the vehicle frame.<br>
It is evident that in the example shown, which is non-restrictive, the tank 12 is made of plastic but it could be made of any other material. Furthermore, in the example it consists of two half-shells 12a and 12b welded with hot blade along the perimeter edges 27, but it could be welded differently, riveted etc. or even made in one single piece.<br>
It has been seen that the tank 12 features the usual characteristics, i.e. anti-splashing fins 14, liquid outlet 15, (clamp 18, filter 16, plug 17 and 0-ring etc.), level or reserve indicator 22, liquid inlet 19 etc.<br>
The novelty and originality of the arrangement is<br>
the initial separation of the tank from the frame, provided with a front fixing system (bracket 23 and elastic plate 24) and rear fixing system (bracket 26 and fastening screw 32) to a portion 13 of the vehicle frame, after its insertion into the inside 13 of said portion.<br>
The tank 12 centering system (centering hole 19) with respect to the frame portion 13 is also particularly innovative. This also permits correct insertion of the pipe union 20, ensuring exact positioning of the tank itself.<br>
As appears evident, said tank arrangement, i.e. independent element not forming part of the vehicle frame and of an appropriate shape and with appropriate elements for integration/connection with the frame, satisfies all the above-mentioned functions which are not implemented in the solutions present on the market.<br>
It has thus been seen that an arrangement according to the present invention achieves the previously described aims.<br>
The arrangement is particularly simple in the implementation phase and does not require complicated equipment for assembly.<br>
The compact tank arrangement of this invention thus conceived can be modified and varied in numerous ways, all falling within the same innovative concept.<br>
Furthermore, in practice any materials, dimensions<br>
and components  can be used according to  technical requirements.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
