				<td>The present invention relates to benzamide compound and process for preparing the same.<br>
This invention relates to benzamide derivatives, or pharmaceuticalry acceptable salts or in vivo hydrolysable esters or amides thereof. These benzamide derivatives possess histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with cancer (Marks et al,, Nature Reviews, 1,194-202, (2001)), cystic fibrosis (li, S. etal, J. Biol Chew.., 274,7803-7815, (1999)), Huntingdons chorea (Steffan, J. S. et al., Nature, 413, 739-743, (2001)) and sickle cell anaemia (Gabbianelli, M. et al., Blood, 95,3555-3561, (2000)), and accordingly are useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal, such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said benzamide derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them ' and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments to inhibit HDAC in a warm-blooded animal, such as man.<br>
Jh the eukaryotic cell, DNA is compacted to prevent transcription factor accessibility. When the cell is activated this compact DNA is made available to DNA-bmdmg proteins, thereby allowing the induction of gene transcription (Beato, M., J. Med. Chem., 74,711-724 ' (1996); Wolffe, A. P., Nature, 387,16-17 (1997)). Nuclear DNA associates with histones to form a complex known as chromatin. The core histones, termed H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 surrounded by 146 base pairs of DNA form the fundamental mat of chramatin, the nucleosome. The N-terminal tails of the core histones contain lysines mat are sites for post-transcriptional acetylation. Acetylation neutralizes the potential of the side chain to form a positive charge on the lysine side chain, and is thought to impact chromatin structure.<br>
Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) are zinc-containing enzymes which catalyse the removal of zcetyl groups from the s-amino termini of lysine residues clustered near the amino terminus of nucleosomal histones. HDACs may be divided into two classes, the first (HDAC 1,2,3 and 8) represented by yeast Rpd3-bTce proteins, and the second (HDAC 4,5,6,7,9 and 10) represented by yeast Hdal-lDce proteins. The reversible process of acetylation is important in transcriptional regulation and cell-cycle progression. HDAC deregulation has been associated with several cancers and HDAC inhibitors, such as Trichostatm A (a natural product isolated from Sireptomyces hygroscopicus), have been shown to exhibit significant anti-tumour effects and inhibition of cell-growth (Meinke, P, T., Current Medicinal Chemistry, 8, 211-235 (2001)). Yoshida et al, Exper. CellRes., 177, 122-l31 (1988) teaches<br><br>
that Trichostatin A causes arrest of rat fibroblasts at the Gl and G2 phases of the cell cycle, thereby implicating HDAC in cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, Trichostatin A has been shown to induce terminal differentiation, inhibit cell growth, and prevent the formation of tumours in mice (Finnin et al, Nature, 401,188-193 (1999)).<br>
To date only a few inhibitors of HDAC are known in the art. There is thus a need to identify additional HDAC inhibitors.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of the formula (I):<br>

-18-<br>
morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, or, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or a metal alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide.<br>
A suitable reactive group X is, for example, a halo, alkoxy, aryloxy or sulphonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methoxy, phenoxy, methanesulphonyloxy, trifluromethanesulphonyloxy or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group. The reactions are conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent or diluent, for example an alkanol or ester such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or ethyl acetate, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimernylfonnamide, HiN-dunethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulphoxide. The reactions are conveniently carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 250°C, preferably in the range 40 to 80°C; A suitable value for the ligands L1 and L2 which are present on the boron atom include, for example, a hydroxy, (l-4C)alkoxy or (l-6C)alkyl ligand, for example a hydroxy, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or butyl ligand. Alternatively the ligands L1 and L2 may be linked such that, together with the boron atom to which they are attached, they form a ring.

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately<br>
following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halo group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an arnino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or /-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a ?-butoxycarbonyI group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a<br><br>
primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
'-   A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art. Biological Assays<br>
