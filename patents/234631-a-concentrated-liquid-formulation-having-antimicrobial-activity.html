Nutrient	Casein soy flour peptone broth for growing the inoculum<br>
media:	Casein soy flour peptone agar with 3% polyoxyethylene(20)sorbitanmono-<br>
oleate; 0.3% lecithin; 0.1% L-histidine<br>
Dilution	Trypticase soy flour peptone broth with 10% polyoxyethylene(20)sorbitan-<br>

a. Use of the formulation of Example 6 as disinfectant<br>
These tests show that the liquid formulations according to the invention have a very potent microbicidal activity, even at low concentrations. These properties are important for disinfectants in general, but in particular for the disinfection of textiles.<br>
Procedure:<br>
0.1 ml of the formulation of Example 6 is diluted with 8.9 ml of water and the dilution is<br>
subsequently treated with 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of a culture of the test bacteria which is<br>
incubated for 16 to 24 hours at 37°C ( = 1% of the formulation of Example 6).<br>
The concentration of the test organisms in the batch is 108 microorganisms/ml.<br>
The batch is mixed thoroughly and subsequently incubated for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature with gentle stirring.<br>
After 5 minutes, 1 ml of the batch is removed and the live bacterial count is determined. To<br>
this end, dilutions are performed in dilution medium, and 0.1 ml each of these dilutions are<br>
plated onto agar media.<br>
The live bacterial count is determined after the plates have been incubated for 24 to 48 hours at 37°C by counting the colonies taking into consideration the dilution factor.<br>
The test results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
The tested formulation of Example 6 shows a reduction of all test microorganisms by at least 5 powers of ten after as little as 5 minutes in the suspension test.<br>
p. Liquid soap with a concentrated formulation comprising 2.4.4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxvdiphenyl ether<br>
The tests of Examples 14b. and 14c. show that soap formulations to which the liquid formulations according to the invention are added have a powerful microbicidal activity, which is required for use as a disinfectant or decontaminant for hands, but also for the microbicidal treatment of surfaces (surface disinfectants, antimicrobial dishwashing products, household detergents and the like).<br>
Test formulation:<br>
4%	of sodium lauryl sulfate<br>
10%	of formulation of Example 6<br>
to 100%	water<br>
The pH is brought to 5.5 using ethanolamine.<br>
Procedure:<br>
9 ml of the formulation are mixed with 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of a bacterial suspension which<br>
has been incubated at 37°C for 16 to 24 hours, and the mixture is subsequently incubated<br>
at room temperature with stirring.<br>
After an incubation time of 30 seconds, 1 ml of the test batch is removed, diluted in dilution<br>
medium, and 0.1 ml each of the dilutions are plated onto agar media.<br>
After the plates have been incubated for 24 to 48 hours at 37°C, the live microbial count is<br>
determined by counting the colonies taking into consideration the dilution factor.<br><br>
The test results are shown in Table 2. Table .2:<br>

10%	of concentrated formulation of Examples 9 to 14,<br>
to 100%	water<br>
The pH is brought to 5.5 using monoethanolamine.<br>
Procedure:<br>
9 ml of the formulation are mixed with 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of a bacterial suspension which<br>
has been incubated at 37°C for 16 to 24 hours, and the mixture is subsequently incubated<br>
at room temperature with stirring.<br>
After an incubation time of 1 minute, 1 ml of the test batch is removed, diluted in dilution<br>
medium, and 0.1 ml each of the dilutions are plated onto agar media.<br>
After the plates have been incubated for 24 to 48 hours at 37°C, the live microbial count is<br>
determined by counting the colonies taking into consideration the dilution factor.<br><br>

me lum.	sorbitanmonooleate; 3% lecithin; 0.1% L-histidine and 0.5% sodium<br>
thiosulfate.<br>
Procedure:<br>
20 g of the soap formulation in question are inoculated with 0.2 ml of a microorganism suspension in such a way that the resulting microbial stress of the product is 105 to 106 microorganisms/g of product.<br>
In order to determine the total microbial count at a particular point in time, 1 g of material is removed, and a dilution series is established in dilution medium. The total microbial count is determined by plating 0.1 ml of the dilutions onto agar media after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours (bacteria and yeasts) or incubation at 28°C for 5 days (Aspergillus).<br>
The total bacterial count in the product is determined after inoculation and also after 1 and 2 weeks. After 2 and 4 weeks, the product is again inoculated in the same manner with test microorganisms, and the total microbial counts are determined after a further 1 and 2 weeks in each case.<br>
The test results are shown in Table 4:<br>
