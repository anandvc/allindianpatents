DRUG PRE-TARGETING  BY MEANS  OF  BI-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES AND HAPTEN  CONSTRUCTS COMPRISING A  CARRIER PEPTIDE AND THE ACTIVE AGENT (S)<br>
[0001]  This application is a continuation-in-part of United States Serial No. 09/382,186, filed August 23, 1999 and a continuation-in-part of United States Serial No. 09/823,746, filed April 3,2001, both of which are continuations-in-part of United States Serial No. 09/337.756, filed June 22,1999, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]  Field of the Invention. The invention relates to immunological reagents for therapeutic use, for example, in radioimmunotherapy (RAIT), and diagnostic use, for example, in radioimmunodctection (RAID) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In particular, the invention relates to bi-specific antibodies (bsAb) and bi-specific antibody fragments (bsFab) which have at least one arm that specifically binds a targeted tissue and at least one other arm that specifically binds a targetable construct Further, the invention relates to monoclonal antibodies that have been raised against specific immunogens, humanized and chimeric monoclonal bi-specific antibodies and antibody fragments having at least one aim that specifically binds a targeted tissue and at least one other arm that specifically binds a targetable construct, DNAs that encode such antibodies and antibody fragments, and vectors for expressing the DNAs, Earlier provisional patent applications, U.S.S.N. 60/090,142 and U.S.S.N. 60/104,156 disclose a part of what is now included in this invention and are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Related Art<br>
10003]   An approach to cancer therapy and diagnosis involves directing antibodies or antibody fragments to disease tissues, wherein the antibody or antibody fragment can target a diagnostic agent or therapeutic agent to the disease site. One approach to this methodology which has been under investigation, involves the use of bsAbs having at least one arm that specifically binds a targeted diseased tissue and at least one other arm that specifically binds a low molecular weight hapten. In this methodology, a bsAb is administered and allowed to localize to target, and to clear normal tissue. Some time later, a radiolabeled low molecular weight hapten is given, which being recognized by the second specificity of the bsAb, also localizes to the original target.<br>
|0004|  Although low MW haptens used in combination with bsAbs possess a large number of specific imaging and therapy uses, it is impractical to prepare individual bsAbs for each possible application-Further, the application of a bsAb/low MW hapten system has to contend with several other issues. First,<br>
the arm of the bsAb that binds to the low MW hapten must bind with high affinity, since a low MW hapten is designed to clear the living system rapidly, when not bound by bsAb. Second, the non-bsAb-bound low MW hapten actually needs to clear the living system rappidly to avoid non-target tissue uptake and retention. Third, the detection and/'or therapy agent must remain associated with the low MW hapten throughout its application within the bsAb protocol employed.<br><br>
(0005) Of interest with this approach are bsAbs that direct chelators and metal chelate complexes to cancers using Abs of appropriate dual specificity. The chelators and metal chelate complexes used are often radioactive, using radionuclides such as cobalt-57 (Goodwin et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,863,713), indium-111 (Barbet et aL, U.S. Patent No. 5,256,395 and US. Patent No. 5,274,076, Goodwin et al.J. Nucl Med., 33:1366-1372 (1992), and Kranenborg et ai, Cancer Res (suppL), 55;5864s-5867s (1995) and Cancer (suppl.) 80:2390-2397 (1997)) and gallium-68 (Boden et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 6:373-379, (1995) and Schuhmacher et al., Cancer Res., 55:115'123 (1995)) for radioimmuno-imaging. Because the Abs were raised against the chelators and metal chelate complexes, they have remarkable specificity for the complex against which they were originally raised. Indeed, the bsAbs of Boden et aL have specificity for single cnantiomere of enantiomeric mixtures of chelators and metal-chelate complexes. This great specificity has proven to be a disadvantage in one respect, in that other nuclides such as yrrrium-90 and bismuth-213 useful for radioimmunotherapy (RAIT), and gadolinium useful for MRI, cannot be readily substituted into available reagents for alternative uses. As a result iodine-231, a non-metal, has been adopted for RAIT purposes by using an 1-13 l-labeled indium-metal-chelate complex in die second targeting step. A second disadvantage to this methodology requires that antibodies be raised against every agent desired for diagnostic or therapeutic use,<br>
[00061  Pretargeting methodologies have received considerable attention for cancer imaging and therapy. Unlike direct targeting systems where an effector molecule (e.g., a radionuclide or a drug linked to a small carrier) is directly linked to the targeting agent, in pretargeting systems, the effector molecule is given some time after the targeting agent This allows time for the targeting agent to localize in tumor lesions and, more importantly, clear from the body. Since most targeting agents have been antibody proteins, they tend to clear much more slowly from the body (usually days) than the smaller effector molecules (usually in minutes). In direct targeting systems involving therapeutic radionuclides, the body, and in particular the highly vulnerable red marrow, is exposed to the radiation all the while the targeting agent is slowly reaching its peak levels in the tumor and clearing from the body. In a pretargeting system, the radionuclide is usually bound to a small "effector" molecule, such as a chelate or peptide, which clears very quickly from the body, and thus exposure of normal tissues is minimized. Maximum tumor uptake of the radionuclide is also very rapid because the small molecule efficiently transverses the tumor vasculature and binds to the primary targeting agent. Its small size may also encourage a more uniform distribution in the tumor. (0007 j Pretargeting methods have used a number of different strategies, but most often involve an<br>
avidin/slreptavidin-biotin recognition systern or bi-specific antibodies that co-recognize a tumor antigen and the effector molecule. The avidin/streptavidin system is highly versatile and has been used in several configurations. Antibodies can be coupled with streptavidin or biotin, which is used as the primary targeting agent. This is followed sometime later by the effector molecule, which conjugated with biotin or with avidin/streptavidin, respectively. Another configuration relies on a 3-step approach first targeting a<br><br><br>
[0008]  Pretargeting with a bsAb also requires one arm of the antibody to recognize an effector molecule. Most radionuclide targeting systems reported to date have relied on an antibody to a chelate-metal complex, such as antibodies directed indium-loaded DTPA or antibodies to other chelates. Since the antibody is generally highly selective for this particular chelate-metal complex, new bsAbs would need to be constructed with the particular effector antibody. This could be avoided if the antibody was not specific to the effector, but instead reacted with another substance. In this way, a variety of effectors could be made so long as they also contained the antibody recognition substance. We have continued to develop the pretargeting system originally described by Janevik-Ivanovska et ah that used an antibody directed against a histamine derivative, histaminc-succinyl-glycl (HSG) as the recognition system on which a variety of effector substances could be prepared. Excellent pretargeting results have been reported using a radioiodinated and a rhenium-labeled divalent HSG-containing peptide. In this work, we have expanded this system to include peptides suitable for radiolabeling 90Y, 11 111In, and 177Lu  as well as an alternative 99mTc.binding peptide.<br>
[0009]   Thus, there is a continuing need for immunological agents which can be directed to diseased tissue and can specifically bind to a subsequently administered targetable diagnostic or therapeutic conjugate, and a flexible system that accommodates different diagnostic and therapeutic agents without alteration to the bi-specific or multi-specific antibodies. Objects of the Invention<br><br>

(0011]  Other objects of fee invention are to provide pre-targeting methods of diagnosis and therapy using fee combination of multi-specific antibody and targetable construct, mefeods of making fee multi-specifics, and kits for use in such methods.<br>
[0012]   In accomplishing fee foregoing object, fee present inventors have discovered feat it is advantageous to raise multi-specific Abs against a targetable construct that is capable of carrying one or more diagnostic or therapeutic agents. By utilizing this technique, fee characteristics of fee chelator, metal chelate complex, feerapeutic agent or diagnostic agent can be varied to accommodate differing applications, wifeout raising new multi-specific Abs for each new application.

Tissue-specific antibodies (e.g., against bone man-ow cells, such as CD34, CD74, etc., parathyroglobulin antibodies, etc.) as well as antibodies against non-malignant diseased<br><br>
tissues, such as fibrin of clots, macrophage antigens of atherosclerotic plaques (e.g., CD74 antibodies), and also specific pathogen antibodies (e.g., against bacteria, viruses, and parasites) are well known in the art. [0056] The peptides can be radiolabeled to a high specific activity in a facile manner that avoids the need for purification. In vivo studies in tumor bearing nude mice showed the radiolabeled peptides cleared rapidly from the body with minimal retention in tumor or normal tissues.  When administered 1 to 2 days after a pretargeting dose of the bsAbs, tumor uptake of the radiolabeled peptides increased from 28 to 175-fold with tumor/nontunior ratios exceeded 2:1 to 8:1 within just 3 hour of the peptide injection, which represented a marked improvement over that seen with a 99mTc-anti-CEA Fab' at this same time. The anti-CSAp x anti-HSG F(ab')2 bsAb had the highest and longest retention in the tumor, and when used in combinarioh with the IIIIn-labeled peptide, radiation dose estimates for therapeutic radionuclides, such as 90 and 1500cGy, suggested that as much 12,000 cGy could be delivered to tumors with the kidneys receiving 1500 cGy, but all other tissues receiving 500 cGy, Thus, this pretargeting system is highly flexible, being capable of using a wide array of compounds of diagnostic imaging and therapeutic interest, and by achieving excellent tumor uptake and targeting ratios, is highly promising for use in these applications.<br>
[0057J  Additionally, encompassed is a method for detecting and/or treating target cells, tissues or pathogens in a mammal, comprising administering an effective amount of a bi-specific antibody or antibody fragment comprising at least one arm that specifically binds a targeted tissue and at least one other arm that spec/fically binds a targetable construct. As used herein, the term pathogen" includes, but is not limited to fungi (e.g., Microsporum, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Sporothrix schenckii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma Capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida albicans), viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, rabies vims, influenza vims, hepatitis B vims, Sendai vims, feline leukemia virus, Reo virus, polio virus, human serum parvo-like vims, simian virus 40, respiratory syncytial virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, Varicella-Zoster virus, Dengue virus, rubella virus, measles virus, adenovims, human T-cell leukemia viruses, Epslein-Barr vims, murine leukemia vims, mumps vims, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis vims, wart vims and blue tongue virus), parasites, bacteria (e.g.. Anthrax bacillus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Legionella pneumophilia. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Neisseria meningitidis, Pneumococcus, Hemophilis influenzae B, Treponema pallidum. Lyme disease spirochetes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium leprae. Brucella abortus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tetanus toxin), mycoplasma (e.g.. Mycoplasma arthritidis, M. hyorhinis,<br>
M. orale, M. arginini, Acholeplasma laidlawii, M. salivamm, and M. pneumoniae) and protozoans (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax. Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rhodesiensei, Trypanosoma bmcei. Schistosoma mansom'.

10058]  Also provided herein are antibodies and antibody fragments. The antibody fragments are antigen binding portions of an antibody, such as F(ab')2, F(ab)2i Fab', Fab, and the like. The antibody fragments bind to the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. For example, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody fragment binds to an epitope of CD22,<br>
10059]  The term "antibody fragment" also includes any s}'nthetic or genetically engineered protein feat acts like an antibody by binding to a specific antigen to form a conq)lex. For example, andbody fragments include isolated fragments, "Fv" fragments, consisting of the variable regions of tiie heavy and light chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which Jight and heavy diain variable rsgions ars connected by a peptide linker ("sFv proteins"), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the "hypervariable regioa" Three of these so-called "hypervariable" regions or "complementarity-detennining regions" (CDR) are found in each variable region of the light or heavy chain. Each CDR is flanked by relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The FR are thought to maintain the structural integrity of the variable region. The CDRs of a light chain and the CDRs of a corresponding heavy chain form the antigen-binding site. The "hypervariability" of fee CDRs accounts for the diversity of specificity of antibodies.<br>
[0060] As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any ammal (i.e., vertebrates and invertebrates) including, but not limited to humans and other primates, rodents (e-g-, mice, rats, and guinea pigs),  lagamorphs (e.g., rabbits), bovines (e.g, cattle), ovines (e.g., sheep), caprines (e.g., goats), porcines (e.g., swine), equines (e.g., horses), canines (e.g., dogs), felines (e.g., cats), domestic fowl (e.g., chickens, tuikcys, ducks, geese, other gallinaceous birds, etc.), as well as feral or wild animals, including, but not limited to, such animals as ungulates (e.g., deer), bear, fish, lagamorphs, rodents, birds, etc. It is not intended that the term be limited to a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are encompassed by the term IL       Constructs Targetable to Antibodies<br>
[0061] The targetable construct can be of diverse structure, but is selected not only to diminish fee elicitation of immune responses, but also for rapid in vivo clearance when used within the bsAb targeting method. Hydrophobic agents are best at eliciting strong immune responses, whereas hydrophilic agents are preferred for rapid in vivo clearance, thus, a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic needs to be established. This is accomplished, in part, by relying on fee use of hydrophilic chelating agents to offset the inherent hydrophobicity of many organic moieties. Also, sub-units of fee targetable construct may be chosen which have opposite solution properties, for example, peptides, which contain amino acids, some of which are hydrophobic and some of which are hydrophih'c. Aside from peptides, carbohydrates may be used.<br><br><br>
j0065|   The peptides to be used as immunogens are synthesized conveniently on an automated peptide synthesizer using a solid-phase support and standard techniques of repetitive orthogonal deprotection and coupling. Free amino groups in the peptide, that are to be used later for chelate conjugation, are advantageously blocked with standard protecting groups such as an acetyl group. Such protecting groups wilL be known to the skilLed artisan. See Greene and Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 1999 (John Wiley and Sons, N.Y.). When the peptides are prepared for later use within the bsAb system, they<br><br>
are advantageously cleaved from the resins to generate the corresponding C-terminal amides, in order to<br>
inhibit in vivo carboxypeptidase activity.<br>

(0066]  The presence of hydrophilic chelate moieties on the targetable construct helps to ensure rapid in<br>
vivo clearance. In addition to hydrophilicity, chelators are chosen for their metal-binding properties, and<br>
may be changed at will since, at least for those targetable constructs whose bsAb epitope is part of the<br>
peptide or is a non-chelate chemical hapten, recognition of the metal-chelate complex is no longer an<br>

DOT A, and TETA (p-bromoacetamido-benzyl-tetraethylaminetetraacetic acid) are of use with a variety of metals and radiometals, most particularly with radionuclides of Ga, Y and Cu, respectively. [0068]  DTPA and DOTA-type chelators, where the ligand includes hard base chelating functions such as carboxylate or amine groups, are most effective for chelating hard acid cations, especially Group IIa and Group IIIa metal cations. Such metal-chelate complexes can be made very stable by tailoring the ring size to the metal of interest. Other ring-type chelators such as macrocyclic polyethers are of interest for stably binding nuclides such as 223Ra for RAIT. Porphyrin chelators may be used with numerous radiometals, and are also useful as certain cold metal complexes for bsAb-directed immuno-phototherapy. Also, more than one type of chelator may be conjugated to the targetable construct to bind multiple metal ions, e.g., cold ions, diagnostic radionuclides and/or therapeutic radionuclides.<br><br><br><br>
the linker, e.g., with different chelate ring sizes, to bind preferentially to two different hard acid or soft acid cations, due to the differing sizes of the cations, the geometries of the chelate rings and the preferred complex ion structures of the cations.  This will permit two different metals, one or both of which may be radioactive or useful for MRI enhancement, to be incorporated into a linker for eventual capture by a pretargeted bsAb.<br><br>
[0073]   Preferred chelators include NOT A, DOTA and Tscg and combinations thereof. These chelators have been incorporated into a chelator-peptide conjugate motif as exemplified in the following constructs:<br>
(0074)  The chelator-peptide conjugates (f) and (g), above, has been shown to bind 68Ga and is thus useful in positron emission tomography (PET) applications.<br>
10075]  Chelators are coupled to the peptides of the targetable construct using standard chemistries, some of which are discussed more fully in the working examples below. Briefly, the synthesis of the peptide Ac-Lys(HSG)-D-Tyr-Lys(HSO)-Lys(Tscg-Cys)-NH2 (SEQ ID NO; 4)was accomplished by first attaching Aloc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH to a Rink amide resin on the peptide synthesizer. The protecting group abbreviations<br>
"Aloe" and "Fnioc" used herein refer to die groups aliyloxycarbonyl and fluorenyimethyloxy carbonyl. The FmoC"Cys(Trt)-OH and TscG were then added to the side chain of the lysine using standard Fmoc automated synthesis protocols to form the following peptide: Aloc-Lys(Tscg-Cys(Trt))-rink resin. The Aloc group was then removed. The peptide synthesis was then continued on the synthesizer to make the ibJIowing peptide: Lys(A]oc)-D-Tyr-Lys(Aloc).Lys(Tscg"Cys(Trt)-rink resin (SEQ ID NO: 4). Following N-terminus acylation, and removal of the side chain Aloe protecting groups. The resulting<br><br><br>
10076]  Chelator-peptide conjugates may be stored for long periods as solids. They may be metered into unit doses for metal-binding reactions, and stored as unit doses either as solids, aqueous or semi-aqueous solutions, frozen solutions or lyophilized preparations. They may be labeled by well-known procedures, [0077] Typically, a hard acid cation is introduced as a solution of a convenient salt, and is taken vp by the hard acid chelator and possibly by the soft acid chelator. However, later addition of soft acid cations leads to binding thereof by the soft acid chelator, displacing any hard acid cations which may be chelated therein. For example, even in the presence of an excess of cold IIIInCl3, labeling with 99m-Tc(V) glucoheptonate or with Tc cations generated in situ with stannous chloride and Na99m-Tc04 proceeds quantitatively on the soft acid chelator.<br><br><br>
identify and treat them when they are ectopic (i.e,, displaced torn their normal location), such as in endometriosis.<br>
[0080]  The administration of a bsAb and the targetable construct discussed above may be conducted by administering the bsAb at some time prior to administration of the therapeutic agent which is associated with the linker moiety. The doses and liming of the reagents can be readily devised by a skilled artisan and are dependent on the specific nature of the reagents employed. If a bsAb-F(ab')2 derivative is given first, then a waiting time of 1-6 days before administration of the targetable construct may be appropriate. If an IgG-Fab' bsAb conjugate is the primary targeting vector, then a longer waiting period before administration of the linker moiety may be indicated, in the range of 3-15 days. Alternatively, the bsAb and the targetable construct may be administered substantially at the same time in either a cocktail fonn or by administering one after the other.<br>
|0081]  A wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents can be advantageously conjugated to the targetable construct. Generally, diagnostic and therapeutic agents can include isotopes, drugs, toxins, cytokines, conjugates with cytokines, hormones, growth factors, conjugates, radionuclides, contrast agents, metals, cytotoxic drugs, and immune modulators. For example, gadolinium metal is used for magnetic resonance imaging and fluorochromes can be conjugated for photodynamic therapy. Moreover, contrast agents can be MRI contrast agents, such as gadolinium ions, lanthanum ions, manganese ions, iron, chromium, copper, cobalt, nickel, dysprosium, rhenium, europium, terbium, holmium, neodymium or other comparable label, CT contrast agents, and ultrasound contrast agents. Addtional diagnostic agents can include fluorescent labeling compounds such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycocrytherin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine, chemiluminescent compounds including luminol, isoluminol, an aromatic acridinium ester, an imidazole, an acridinium salt and an oxalate ester, and bioluminescent compounds including luciferin, luciferase and aequorin. Radicmuclides<br><br>
the art. Therapeutic agents may also include, without limitation, others drugs, prodrugs and/or toxins. The terms "drug," 'prodrug," and "toxin" are defined throughout the specification. The terms "diagnostic agent" or "diagnosis" include, but are not limited to, detection agent, detection, or localization. |0083]  When the targetable construct includes a diagnostic agent, the bsAb is preferably administered prior to administration of the targetable construct with the diagnostic agent After sufficient time has passed for the bsAb to target to the diseased tissue, the diagnostic agent is administered, by means of (he targetable construct, so that imaging can be performed. Tumors can be detected in body cavities by means of directly or indirectly viewing various structures to which light of the appropriate wavelength is delivered and then collected, or even by special detectors, such as radiation probes or fluorescent detectors, and the like. Lesions at any body site can be viewed so long as nonionizing radiation can be delivered and recaptured from these structures. For example, PET which is a high resolution, non-invasive, imaging technique can be used with the inventive antibodies and targetable constructs for the visualization of human disease. In PET, 511 ke V gamma photons produced during positron annihilation decay are detected. X-ray, computed tomography (CT), MRl and gamma imaging (e.g.. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomogr^hy (SPECT)) may also be utilized through use of a diagnostic agent that functions with these modalities. 10084]  As discussed eariier, the targetable construct may include radioactive diagnostic agents that emit<br><br>
[0085] The present bsAbs or bsFabs can be used in a method of photodynamic therapy (PUT) as discussed in U.S. Patent Nos, 6,096,289; 4,331.647; 4,818,709; 4,348,376; 4,361,544; 4,444,744; 5,851,527. In PDT, a photosensitizer, e.g., a hematoporphyrin derivative such as dihematopoiphyiin ether, is administered to a subject. Anti-tumor activity is initiated by the use of light, e.g., 630 nm. Alternate photosensitizers can be utilized, including those useful at longer wavelengths, where skin is less photosensitized by the sun. Examples of such photosensitizers include, but arc not limited to, benzoporphyrin monoacid ring A (BPD-MA), tin etiopurpurin (SnET2), sulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (AlSPc) and lutetium texaphyrin (Lutex).<br>
[0086] Additionally, in PDT, a diagnostic agent may be injected, for example, systematically and laser-induced fluorescence can be used by endoscopes including wireless capsule-sized endoscopes or cameras to detect sites of cancer which have accreted the light-activated agent. For example, this has been applied to fluorescence bronchoscopic disclosure of early lung tumors.  Doiron et al Chest 76:32 (1979). In another<br>
example, the antibodies and antibody fragments can be used in single photon emission. For example, a Tc-<br><br><br>
00871] Therapeutically useful immunoconjugates can be obtained by conjugating photoactive agents or dyes to an antibody composite. Fluorescent and other chromogens, or dyes, such as porphyrins sensitive to visible light, have been used to detect and to treat lesions by directing the suitable light to the lesion. In therapy, this has been termed photoradiation, phototherapy, or photodynamic therapy (Jori et al (eds.),<br><br>
include iodine compounds, barium compounds, gallium compounds, thallium compounds, etc. Specific compounds include barium, diatrizoate, ethiodized oil, gallium citrate, iocarmic acid, iocetamic acid, iodamide, iodipamlde, iodoxamic acid, iogulamide, iohexol, iopamidol, iopanoic acjd, ioprocemic acid, josefamic acid, ioseric acid, iosulamide meglumine, iosemetic acid, iotasul, totetric acid, iothalamic acid, iotroxic acid, ioxaglic acid, ioxotrizoic acid, ipodate, meglumine, metrizamide, metrizoate, propyliodone, and thallous chloride. Ultrasound contrast materia] may also by used including  dcxtrsn and Uposomes, particularly gas-filled liposomes. In one embodiment, an immunomodulator, such as a cytokine, may also be conjugated to the targetable construct by a linker or through other methods known by those skilled in the<br><br>
construct having a low MW hapten is administered. After the enzyme is pretargeted to the target site by bsAb;targetable construct binding, a cytotoxic drug is injected that is known to act at the target site. The dnig may be one which is detoxified by the mammal's ordinary detoxification processes to form an<br>
intermediate of lower toxicity.  For example, the drug may be converted into the potentially less toxic<br><br>
glucuronide in the liver. The detoxified intermediate can then be reconverted to its more toxic form by the pretargeted enzyme at the target site, and this enhances cytotoxicity at the target site. (00901 Alternatively, an administered prodrug can be converted to an active drug by the pretargeted enzyme. The pretargeted enzyme improves the efficacy of the treatment by recycling the detoxified drug. This approach can be adopted for use with any enzyme-drug pair. Alternatively, the targetable construct with enzyme can be mixed with the targeting bsAb prior to administration to the patient. After a sufficient time has passed for the bsAb:targetable construct- conjugate to localize to the target site and for unbound targetable construct to clear from circulation, a prodrug is administered. As discussed above, the prodrug is then converted to the drug in situ by the pre-targeted enzyme.<br>
[0091]   Certain cytotoxic drugs that are useful for anticancer therapy are relatively insoluble in serum Some are also quite toxic in an unconjugated form, and their toxicity is considerably reduced by conversion to prodrugs. Conversion of a poorly soluble drug to a more soluble conjugate, e.g:, a glucuronide, an ester of a hydrophilic acid or an amide of a hydrophilic amine, will improve its solubility in the aqueous phase of serum and its ability to pass through venous, arterial or capillary cell walls and to reach the interstitial fluid bathing the tumor. Cleavage of the prodrug deposits the less soluble drug at the target site. Many examples of such prodrug-to-drug conversions are disclosed in U,S, Patent No. 5,851,527, to Hansen.<br><br><br>
[0094]  Eloposide is a widely used cancer drug that is detoxified to a major extent by fonnation of its glucuronide and is within the scope of the invention. See, e.g., Hande et aL Cancer Res. 48:1829-1834 (1988). Glucuronide conjugates can be prepared from cytotoxic dmgs and can be injected as therapeutics for tumors pre-targeted with mAb-glucuronidase conjugates. See, e.g., Wang et aL Cancer Res, 52:4484 4491 (1992). Accordingly, such conjugates also can be used with the pre-targeting approach described here. Similarly, designed prodrugs based on derivatives of daunomycin and doxorubicin have been described for use with carboxylesterases and glucuronidases. See, c.g., Baikina et aL J. Med Chem. ' 40:4013-4018 (1997), Other examples of prodrug/enzyme pairs that can be used within the present invention include, but are not limited to, glucuronide prodrugs of hydroxy derivatives of phenol mustards and beta-g/ucuronidase; phenol mustards or CPT-l I and carboxypeptidase; methotrexate-substituted alpha-amino acids and carboxypeptidase A; penicillin or cephalosporin conjugates of drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine and doxorubicin and beta-lactamase; etoposide phosphate and alkaline phosphatase.[<br>
[0095] The enzyme capable of activating a prodrug at the target site or improving the efficacy of a normal therapeutic by controlling the body's detoxification pathways may altematively be conjugated to the hapten. The enzyme-hap en conjugate is administered to the subject following administration of the pre-targeting bsAb and is directed to the target site. After the enzyme is localized at the target site, a cytotoxic drug is injected, which is known to act at the target site, or a prodrug form thereof which is converted to the drug in situ by the pretargeted enzyme. As discussed above, the drug is one which is detoxified to form an intermediate of lower toxicity, most commonly a glucuronide, using the mammal's ordinary detoxification processes. The detoxified intermediate, e.g., the glucuronide, is reconverted to its more toxic form by the pretargeted enzyme and thus has enhanced cytotoxicity at the target site. This results in a recycling of the drug. Similarly, an administered prodrug can be converted to an active drug through normal biological processes. The pretargeted enzyme improves the efficacy of the treatment by lecycling the detoxified drug. This approach can be adopted for use with any enzyme-drug pair. [0096] In an alternative embodiment, the enzyme-hapten conjugate can be mixed with the targeting bsAb prior to administration to the patient. After a sufficient time has passed for the enzyme-hapten-bsAb conjugate to localize to the target site and for unbound conjugate to clear from circulation, a prodrug is administered. As discussed above, the prodrug is then converted to the drug in situ by the pre-targeted enzyme,<br>
[0097] The invention further contemplates the use of the inventive bsAb and the diagnostic agent(s) in the context of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) protocols, BNCT is a binary system designed to<br>
deliver ionizing radiation to tumor cells by neutron irradiation of tumor-localized 10B atoms. BNCT is based on the nuclear reaction which occurs when a stable isotope, isotopically eiuiched 10B (present in 19.8% natural abundance), is irradiated with thermal neutrons to produce an alpha particle and a 7Li nucleus. These particles have a path length of about one cell diameter, resulting in high linear energy transfer. Just a few of the short-range 1.7 MeV alpha particles produced in this nuclear reaction are<br><br>
sufficient to target the cell nucleus and destroy it. Success with BNCT of cancer requires methods for localizing a high concentration of 10B at tumor sites, while leaving non-target organs essentially boron-free. Compositions and methods for treating tumors in subjects using pre-targeting bsAb for BNCT are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,228,362 and can easily be modified for the pujposes of the present invention.<br>
(00981  In another embodiment of the present invention, the peptide backbone of the targetabie construct is conjugated to a prodrug. The pre-targeting bsAb is administered to the patient and allowed to localize to the target and substantially clear circulation. At an appropriate later time, a targetabie construct comprising a prodrug, for example poly-glutamic acid (SN-38-ester)10 is given, thereby localizing the prodrug specifically  at the tumor target. Jt is known that tumors have increased amounts of enzymes released from intracellular sources due to the high rate of lysis of cells within and around tumors. A practitioner can capitalize on this fact by appropriately selecting prodrugs capable of being activated by these enzymes. For example, carboxylesterase activates the prodrug poly-glutamic acid (SN-38-ester)10 by cleaving the ester bond of the poly-glutamic acid (SN-38-ester)10 releasing large concentrations of free SN-38 at the tumor. Alternatively, the appropriate enzyme also can be targeted to the tumor site. /0099J  After cleavage from the targetabie construct, the drug is intemalized by the tumor cells. Alternatively, the drug can be intemalized as part of an intact complex by virtue of cross-linking at the target. The targetabie construct can induce internalization of tumor-bound bsAb and thereby improve the efficacy of the treatment by causing higher levels of the drug to be internalized, [0100]  A-vaiiety of peptide caniers-are-well-suited for conjugation to prodrugs,, including.polyaniino_ acids, such as polylysine, polyglutamic (E) and aspartic acids (D), including D-amino acid analogs of the same, co-polymers, such as poly(Lys-G3u} {poly[KE]}, advantageously from 1:10 to 10:1. Copolymers based on amino acid mixtures such as poly(Lys-Ala-Glu-Tyr (SEQ ID NO: 8) (KAEY; 5:6:2:1) can also be employed. Smaller polymeric carriers of defined molecular weight can be produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques, readily producing polypeptides of from 2-50 residues in chain length. A second advantage of this type of reagent, other than precise structural definition, is the ability to place single or any desired number of chemical handles at certain points in the chain. These can be used later for attachment of recognition and therapeutic haptens at chosen levels of each moiety. [0101]   Poly(ethylene) glycol [PEG] has desirable in vivo properties for a bi-specific antibody prodrug approach. Ester linkages between the hydroxyl group of SN-38 and both ends of a standard di-hydroxyl PEG can be introduced by insertion of diacids such as succinic acid between the SN-38 and PEG hydroxy] groups, to generate species such as SN-38-O-CO(CH2)2CO-O-PEG-O-CO(CH2)2CO-OSN-38. The di-SN-38-PEG produced can be considered as the shortest member of the class of SN-38-polymer prodrugs. The desirable in vivo properties ofPEG derivatives and the limited loading capacity due to their dimeric functionality led to the preparation of PEG co-polymers having greater haptcn-bearing capacity such as those described by Poiani et al See, e.g., Poiani et al Bioconjugate Chem,, 5:621-630,1994. PEG<br><br>
derivatives are activated at both ends as their bis(succinimidyl)carbonate derivatives and co-polymerized with multi-functional diamines such as lysine. The product of such co-polymerization, containing (-Lys(COOH)-PEG-Lys(COOH)-PEG-)n repeat units wherein the lysyl carboxyl group is not involved in the polymerization process, can be used for attachment of SN-38 residues. The SN-38 residues are reacted with the free carboxyl groups to produce SN-38 esters of the (-Lys-(COOH)-PEG-Lys(COOH)-PEG-)n chain.<br>
[0102]  Other synthetic polymers that can be used to cany recognition haptens and prodrugs include N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HMPA) copolymers, poly(styrene-co-maleic acid/anhydride (SMA), poly(divinylether maleic anhydride) (DIVEMA), polyethyleneimine, ethoxylated polyethylene-imine, starburst dendrimers and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) fPVP). As an example, DIVEMA polymer comprised of multiple anhydride units is reacted with a limited amount of SN-38 to produce a desired substitution ratio of drug on the polymer backbone. Remaining anhydride groups are opened under aqueous conditions to produce free carboxylate groups. A limited number of the free carboxylate groups are activated using standard water-soluble peptide coupling agents, e.g. l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethyIaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDO),-and coupled to a recognition moiety bearing a free amino group. An example of the latter is histamine, to which antibodies have been raised in the past<br>
[0103]  A variety of prodrugs can be conjugated to the targetable construct The above exemplifications of polymer use are concerned with SN-38, the active metabolite of the prodrug CPT-l 1 (irinotecan). SN-38 has an aromatic hydroxyl group that was used in the above descriptions to produce aryl esters susceptible to esterase-type enzymes. Similarly the camptothecin analog topotecan, widely used in chemotherapy, has an available aromatic hydroxyl residue that can be used in a similar manner as described for SN-38, producing esterase-susceptible polymer-prodrugs. [0104]  Doxorubicin also contains aromatic hydroxyl groups that can be coupled to caiboxylate-containing polymeric carriers using acid-catalyzed reactions similar to those described for the camptothecin family. Similarly, doxorubicin analogs like daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin can be coupled in the same manner. Doxorubicin and other drugs with amino 'chemical handles, active enough for chemical coupling to polymeric carriers can be effectively coupled to carrier molecules via these free amino groups in a number of ways. Polymers bearing free carboxylate groups can be activated en situ (EDC) and the activated polymers mixed with doxorubicin to directly attach the drug to the side-chains of the polymer via amide bonds. Amino-containing drugs can also be coupled to amino-pendant polymers by mixing commercially available and cleavable cross-linking agents, such as ethylene<br>
glycobis{succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) or bi5-[2-(5uccinimido-oxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone {BSOCOES, Molecular Biosciences, Huntsville, AL), to cross-link the two amines as two amides after reaction with the his(succinimidyl) ester groups. This is advantageous as these groups remain susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. For example, (doxorubicin-EGS)n-poly-lysine remains susceptible to enzymatic cleavage of the diester groups in the EGS linking chain by enzymes such as<br><br><br><br><br><br>
or It can be injected and localized at the target site and, after non-targeted antibody has substantially cleared from the circulatory system of the mammal, enzyme can be injected in an amount and by a route which enables a sufficient amount of the enzyme to reach a localized antibody or antibody fragment and bind to it to form the antibody-enzyme conjugate in situ.<br><br><br>
toxicity from the detoxified intermediate to a toxic form, and, therefore, of increasing the toxicity of the dnig at the target site. A second targetable construct may also be used which comprises a carrier portion which comprises or bears at least one epitope recognizable by the at least one other arm of the bi-specific antibody or antibody fragment, and a prodrug, when the enzyme is capable of converting the prodrug to a drug at the target site. Instruments which facilitate identiiying or treating diseased tissue also can be included in the kit. Examples include, but are not linuted to application devices, such as syringes. Solutions required for utilizing the disclosed invention for identifying or treating diseased tissue also can be included in the kit.<br>
(01161  The targetable construct may be administered intravenously, intraaterially, intraoperatively, endoscopically, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrapleurally, intrathecally, by perfusion through a regional catheter, or by direct intralesional injection, and can be by continuous infusion or by single or multiple boluses, or through other methods known to those skilled in the art for diagnosing (detecting) and treating diseased tissue. Further, the targetable construct may include agents for other methods of detecting and treating diseased tissue including, without limitation, conjugating dextran or liposome formulations to the targetable construct for use with ultrasound, or other contrast agents for use with other imaging modalities, such as X-ray, CT, PET, SPECT and ultrasound, as previously described VI.       Methods for Raising Antibodies<br>
j01l7)   Abs to peptide backbones and/or haptens are generated by well-known methods for Ab production. For example, injection of an immunogen, such as (peptide)n-KLH, wherein KLH is keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and n=I-30, in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by two subsequent injections of the same immunogen suspended in incomplete Freund's adjuvant into immunocompetent animals, is followed three days after an i.v. boost of antigen, by spleen cell harvesting. Harvested spleen cells are then fused with Sp2/0-Agl4 myeloma cells and culture supematants of the resulting clones aruilyzed for anti-pepdde reactivity using a direct-binding ELISA. Fine specificity of generated Abs can be analyzed for by using peptide fragments of the original immunogen. These fragments can be prepared readily using an automated peptide synthesizer. For Ab production, enzyme-deficient hybridomas are isolated to enable selection of fused cell lines. This technique also can be used to raise antibodies to one or more of the chelates comprising the linker, e.g., ln(ni)-DTPA chelates. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to an In(in)-di-DTPA are known (Barbel 395 supra).<br>
[0118] The antibodies used in the present invention are specific to a variety of cell surface or intracellular tumor-associated antigens as marker substances. These markers may be substances produced by the tumor or may be substances which accumulate at a tumor site, on tumor cell surfaces or within tumor cells, whether in the cytoplasm, the nucleus or in various organelles or sub-cellular structures. Among such tumor-associated maricers are those disclosed by Herberznan, "Immunodiagnosis of Cancer", in Fleishercd., 'The Clinical Biochemistry of Cancer", page 347 (American Association of Clinical Chemists, 1979) and in U.S. Patent<br><br>
Nos. 4.150,149; 4,361.544; and 4,444,744. See also U,S. Patent No. 5,965,132, to Thorpe et aL, U.S. Patent 6,004,554, to Thorpe et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,071,491, to Epstein et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,017,514, to Epstein et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,882,626, to Epstein et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,019,368, to Epstein et al., and U.S. Patent No. 6,342,221, to Thorpe et al, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. [0119] Tumor-associated markers have been categorized by Herberman, supra, in a number of categories including oncofetal antigens, placental antigens, oncogenic or tumor vims associated antigens, tissue associated andgens, organ associated antigens, ectopic hormones and normal andgens or variants thereof. Occasionally, a sub-unit of a tumor-associated marker is advantageously used to raise antibodies having higher tumor-specificity, e.g., the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or the gamma region of carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), which stimulate the production of antibodies having a greatly reduced cross-reactivity to non-tumor substances as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos, 4,361,644 and 4,444,744. Markers of tumor vasculature (e.g,, VEGF), of tumor necrosis (Epstein patents), of membrane receptor (e.g., folate receptor, EGFR), of transmembrane antigens (e.g., PSNfA), and of oncogene products can also serve as suitable tumor-associated targets for antibodies or antibody fragments. Markers of normal  cell constituents which are expressed copiously on tumor cells, such as B-cell complex antigens (e.g., CD19, CD20, C021, CD22, CD23, and HLA-DR on B-cell malignancies), as well as cytokines expressed by certain tumor cells (e.g., IL-2 receptor in T-cell malignancies) are also suitable targets for the antibodies and antibody fragments of this invention. Other well-known tumor associated antigens that can be taigeted by the antibodies and antibody fragments of this invention include, but are not limited to, CEA, CSAp, TAG-72, MUC-1, MUC-2, MUC-3, MUC-A, EGP-I, EGP-2, BrE3, PAM-4, KC-4, A3. KS-1, PSMA, PSA, tenascin, TlOl, SlOO, MAGE, HLA-DR, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD30, and CD74.<br>
[0120]  Another marker of interest is transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor (TAd). See Yu et al Nat Immunol 7252-256 (2000). Briefly, TACI is a marker for B-cell malignancies (e.g,, lymphoma). Further it is known that TACI and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) are bound by the tumor necrosis factor homolog a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). APRIL stimulates in vitro proliferation of primary B and T cells and increases spleen weight due to accumulation of B cells in vivo. APRIL also competes with TALL-I (also called BLyS or BAFF) for receptor binding. Soluble BCMA and TACI specifically prevent binding of APRIL and block APRIL-stimulated proliferation of primary  B cells, BCMA-Fc also inhibits production of antibodies against keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Pneumovax in mice, indicating that APRIL and/or TALL-I signaling via BCMA and/or TACI are required for generation of humoral immunity. Thus, APRIL-TALL-I and BCMA-TACI foim a two ligand-two receptor patiiway involved in stimulation of B and T cell function.<br>
|0121] After the initial raising of antibodies to the immunogen, the antibodies can be sequenced and subsequently prepared by recombinant techniques. Humanization and chimerization of murine antibodies and antibody fragments are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, humanized monoclonal antibodies are produced by transfenring mouse complementary determining regions from heavy and light<br><br>
variable chains of the mouse immunoglobulin into a human variable domain, and then, substituting human residues in the framework regions of the murine counterparts. The use of antibody components derived from humanized monoclonal antibodies obviates potential problems associated with the immunogenicity of murine constant regions. General techniques for cloning murine immunoglobulin variable domains are described, for example, by the publication of Oriandi et al, Proc, Nat'lAcad. Set USA 86:3833 (1989), which is<br><br>
stepwise process beginning with the formation of yeast artificial  chromosomes (YACs) containing either human heavy- or light-chain immunoglobulin loci in germline configuration. Since each insert is approximately 1 Mb in size, YAC construction requires homologous recombination of overlapping fragments of the immunoglobulin loci.

[0129] A chimeric Ab is constructed by ligating the cDNA fragment encoding the mouse light variable and heavy variable domains to fragment encoding the C domains from a human antibody. Because the C domains do not contribute to antigen binding, the chimeric antibody will retain the same antigen specificity as the original mouse Ab but will  be closer to human antibodies in sequence. Chimeric Abs still contain some<br><br>
[0133] Recombinant methods can be used to produce a variety of fusion proteins. For example a fusion protein comprising a Fab fragment derived from a humanized monoclonal anti-CEA antibody and a scFv derived from a murine anti-diDTPA can be produced A flexible linker, such as GGGS (SEQ ID NO: 10)<br><br>
connects the scFv to the constant region of  the heavy chain of the anti-CEA antibody. Alternatively, the scFv can be connected to the constant region of the light chain of hMN-14. Appropriate linker sequences necessary for the in-frame connection of the heavy chain Fd to Ae scFv are introduced into the VL and<br>
gestate. After birth, the progeny are screened for the presence of the introduced DNA by Southern analysis. Milk from transgenic females is analyzed for the presence and functionality of the bscAb using<br><br>

Also preferred are bi-specific antibodies which incorporate one or more of the CDRs of Mu-9 or 679, The antibody can also be a fusion protein or abi-specific antibody that incorporates a Class-Ill anti-CEA antibody and the Fv of 679.

(01701  The peptide, Ac-Phe-Lys(Ac)-Tyr-Lys(Ac)-OH (SEQ ID NO: 2), is assembled using a resin for solid-phase synthesis and attaching the first residue (lysine) to the resin as the differentially protected derivative alpha-Fmoc-Lys(Aloc)-OH. The alpha-Fmoc protecting group is selectively removed and die Fmoc-Tyr(OBut), alpha-Fmoc-Lys(Aloc)-OH, and Fmoc-Phe-OH added with alternate cycles of coupling and alpha-amino group deprotection. The Aloe - and OBut- side-chain protecting groups are then removed by reaction with TFA and the free alpha- and epsilon-amino groups are capped by reaction with acetic anhydride to give Ac-Phe-Lys(Ac)-Tyr.Lys(Ac)-OH (SEQ ID NO: 2).<br>

Keyhold limpet hemocyanin(KLH) buffered at pH 8.5 is treated with a 100-fold molar excess of the activated peptide and the conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4oC.

After repurification from excess iodoacetamide the Fab' is reacted with a 400-fold molar excess of the galactosylation agent, the ihio-imidate of cyanomethyl-23,4,6-tetra-0-acctyl-l-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (see Karacay et aJ.).

Activated DTPA and DTPA Addition<br>
[0185] The DTPA, 5 g was dissolved in 40 mL 1.0 M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in methanol. The methanol was removed under hi-vacuum to obtain a viscous oil. The oil was dissolved in 50 mL DMF and the volatile solvents were removed under hi-vacuum on the rotary evaporator. The DMF treatment was repeated two more times. The viscous oil was then dissolved in 50 ml DMF and mixed wife 5 g HBTU. An 8 ml aliquot of the activated DTPA solution was then added to the resin which was vortex mixed for 14 hr. The DTPA treatment was repeated until the resin gave a negative test for amines using the Kaiser test. Alternatively, DTPA Tetra-t-butyl ester could be used with conventional coupling agents such as DIC and HBTU. {See Arano Y, Uezono T. Akizawa H, Ono M, Wakisaka K, Nakayama M, Sakahara H,<br><br><br>

Twenty-four hours after the clearing dose of agalactose-WI2-Fab', the fusion protein in the blood is reduced 20-fold the concentration of the protein just prior to injection of the clearing agent The patient is then infused with the IMP 245 Y-90-di-B2-DTPA-peptide, containing 50 mCi of Y-90. ACT scan performed three months later demonstrates three of the lesions have disappeared, and the remaining two have not increased in size. The CEA blood serum level is decreased to 10 ng/mL at this time. No increase is seen in the CEA blood serum level for the following 6 months, and CT scans demonstrate no growth of the two tumor lesions. The therapy is repeated a year after the first therapy, when an increase in CEA is observed, and the two tumor lesions are observed to decrease in size at 3 months and six months after the second therapy. The blood serum CEA level after six months is less than 5 ng/mL.<br>
Example 29)      Preparation of a carboxylesterase-DTPA conjugate<br>
10204]  Two vials of rabbit liver caiboxylesterase (SIGMA; protein content -17 mg) are reconstituted in 2.2 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.7 and mixed with a 25-fold molar excess of CA-DTPA using a freshly prepared stock solution (- 25 mg/mJ) of the latter in OMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the conjugation mixture is 3 % (v/v). After 1 hour of incubation, the mixture is pre-purified on two 5-mL spin-columns (Sephadex G50/80 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.3) to remove excess reagent and DMSO. The eluate is purified on a TSK 3000G Supeico column using 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH 6.8 at 4 ml/min. The fraction containing conjugate is concentrated on a Centricon-10TM concentrator, and buffer-exchanged with 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 6.S. Recovery: 0.9 ml, 4.11 mg/ml (3.7 mg)'. Analytical HPLC analysis using standard conditions, with in-line UV detection, revealed a major peak with a retention time of 9.3 min and a minor peak at 10.8 min in 95-to-S ratio. Enzymatic analysis showed 115 enzyme units/mg protein, comparable to unmodified carboxylesterase. Mass spectral analyses (MALDI mode) of both unmodified and DTPA-modified CE shows an average DTPA substitution ratio near 1.5. A metal-binding assay using a known excess of indium spiked with radioactive indium confirmed the DTPA-.enzyme ratio to be 1.24 and 1.41 in duplicate experiments. Carboxylesterase-DTPA is labeled with In-111 acetate at a specific activity of 12.0 mCi/mg, then treated with excess of non-radioactive indium acetate, and finally treated with 10 mM EDTA to scavenge off excess non-radioactive indium. Incorporation by HPLC and ITLC analyses is 97.7%. A HPLC sample is completely complexed with a 20-fold molar excess of bi-speciiic antibody hMN-14 Fab' x 734 Fab', and the resultant product further<br><br>
complexes with WI2 (anti-ID to hMN-14), with the latter in 80-fold molar excess with respect to bi-specific antibody.<br>

samples were collected, stored on ice, and sent on ice as soon as possible for HPLC analysis. The HPLC<br>
(by size exclusion chromatography) of the urine samples showed that the In-111 labeled peptide could still<br>
bind to the antibody. The reverse phase HPLC analysis showed that the radiolabeled peptide was excreted<br>
intact in the urine. The amount of activity remaining in the scrum was too low to be analyzed by reverse pliase HPLC due to the poor sensitivity of the detector. Doxorubicin has -95 % hepatobiliary clearance. Thus, by attaching the his DTPA peptide in a hydrolyzeable manner, the biodistribution of the drug is altered to give - 100 % renal excretion. This renders the drug far less toxic because all of the nontargeted drug is rapidly excreted intact<br><br>

[0217]   Combinations of the bi-specific constructs described in the present invention or others of similar specificities are suitable for pretargeted RAIT, where IMP-192 peptide and its analogues are labeled with therapeutic radioisotopes such as IS8-Re, 2I3-Bi, 67-Cu and the like. It will be recognized that therapeutic chelates can be conjugated to peptides that have other than chelate epitopes for recognition by bsAbs, as described above.<br>
(0218]   It will be appreciated as well that detectable radiolabels can be directed to a site of interest, e.g. a tumor, which is to be excised or otherwise detected and /or treated in intra-operati, endoscopi intravascular or other similar procedures, using the pretargeting meths of the present invention, in combination with various linkers. The pretargeting is effected with non-radioactive bsAbs and the eventual administration and localization of the low molecular weight radiolabeled linker, and clearance of unbound linker, are both comparatively rapid, compatible with surgical procedures that should avoid needless delay and which can use radioisotopes with short half-lives. Additionally, the disclosed therapies can be used for post-surgical radioimmunotherapy protocols to ensure the eradication of residual tumor cells.<br>
Example 37)      Synthesis of DOTA-Phe-Lvs(GVD-Tvr-Ly(SGVLvsnrseg-Cys)NHo/SEQ ID N: I) (IMP245)<br><br>
[219] The peptide was synthesized by the usual double coupling procedure as described for the synthesis of IMP 192. The tri-t-butyl DOTA was added to the C-terminus of the pepde with a single benzotria2ole-l"yl-oxy"triS"(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hcxafluorophosphate (BOP) coupling using 5 eq of protected DOTA for 16 hr. The resin was then capped with acetic anhydride. The Aloc groups on the side chains were removed using the palladium catalyst and the N-trityl-HSG groups were added as described for the synthesis of IMP 243. The product was cleaved from the resin and purified by HPLC to afford 0.2385 g of product, from four fractions, after lyophilization.. ESMS MH+ 1832<br>
Example 38)      Tc-99m Kit Fonnulation<br>
(0220]  A formulation buffer was prepared which contained 22.093 g hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin, 0.45 g 2,4-d]hydroxybenzoic acid, 0.257 g acetic acid sodium salt, and 10.889g aplpha-g(ucoheptonic acid sodium salt dissolved in 170 mL nitrogen degassed water. The solution was adjusted to pH 5.3 with a few drops of 1 M NaOH then further diluted to a total volume of 220 mL. A stannous buffer solution was prepared by diluting 0.2 mL of SnCl2 (200 mg/mL) with 3.8 mL of the formulation buffer. The peptide. IMP 245 (0.0029g), was dissolved in 1 mL 1.6 x 10-3 M InCl3 in 0.1 M HCl. The peptide solution was mixed with 2 mL 0.5 M NH4OAC and allowed to incubate at room temperature for IS min. The formulation buffer, 75 mL, and 0.52 mL of the stannous buffer were then added to the peptide solution. The peptide solution was then filtered through a 0.22 µm Millex GV filter in 1.5 mL aliquots into 3 mL lyophilization vials. The filled vials were frozen immediately, lyophilized and crimp sealed under vacuum.<br>
Example 39)      Tc-99m Labeling of IMP 245 High Temperature (Boiling Water Bath)<br>
[0221]  The pertechnetate solution (29 mCi) in 1.5 mL of saline was added to the kit The kit was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The kit was cooled to room temperature before use.<br>
Low Temperature (3 loC)<br>
10222]  The pertechnetate solution (25 mCi) in 1.5 mL of saline was added to the kit The kit was incubated at room temperature for 14 min and heated in a 37oC water bath for 18 min. The kit was cooled to room temperature before use. The HPLC retention time for this label is slightly different because a different injector was used.<br>
Example 40)      Peptide Analysis (HPLC) of IMP 245<br>
10223]  The peptide was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC and size exclusion Iff LC (shown below). The size exclusion HPLC traces indicated that the peptide binds to two mMU-9 x m679 and two hMN-14 x m679 bi-specific antibodies {see "A Universal Pre-Targeting System for Cancer Detection and Therapy Using Bi-specific Antibody," Sharkey, R.M..
