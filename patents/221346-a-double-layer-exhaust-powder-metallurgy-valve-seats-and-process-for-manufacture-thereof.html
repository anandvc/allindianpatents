FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a Double Layer Exhaust Powder Metallurgy Valve Seats having uniform distribution of metal carbides useful in two/four stroke gasoline engine driven vehicles. This invention also relates to a process of manufacturing double layer powder metallurgy exhaust valve seats.<br>
BACK GROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
Using the casting route conventionally produced valve seats. However, Powder Metallurgy (PM) Route has become more popular as the PM process produces large volume of products at a low cost. 1 he production is faster and the products thus obtained are near to net shape. Further, the chemistry of the valve seat can be designed by way of blending various ingredients to form the part. Hence, each ingredient may be chosen to meet a specific property or requirement.<br>
Exhaust valve seats require room temperature properties such as hardness, and crushing strength, both required for handling are due to and for not failing during fitment. Further,  these properties are essential for performance during the initial few operating cycles during which time the seat would not have heated to the operating temperature. The operating temperature of exhaust valve seat is 350-450°C and in that condition, retention of hardness and resistance to wear is very critical. Commonly used PM alloys use Fe as the base material with addition of carbide forming elements such as Mo, Cr, Nb, V and W to form stable carbides that provide the above properties.<br>
In general materials containing Cobalt, Cr, Ni, and Mo are commonly added for valve seat production. Generally, in the valve seat, only the valve side of the part is subjected to severe working conditions as compared to the cylinder side material. Due to this, as a part of cost reduction, some of the manufacturers started using double layer valve seats with rich mix containing Iron, Co, Cr, Mo and C in the valve side and cylinder side containing Iron with Mo and Carbon additions.<br><br>
The disadvantages Co base materials addition is that it is a strategic material and is expensive. It also requires higher sintering temperature in the range of 1180-1220°C which makes the processor cost also to increase.<br>
The commercially available High-speed steel powder along with Iron Powder addition is an attractive alternative to reduce cost and commercially these types of valve seats are available. High-speed steel is still an expensive material. The cost of HSS powder M3/2 , which is the popular powder, used for valve seat is expensive.<br>
This type of high wear resistance, high temperature strength required only on the side where the valve comes in contact with the valve and on the Cylinder side good creep resistance is sufficient.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a double layer powder metallurgy exhaust valve seat with HSS containing alloy on the valve side and Fe-Cr-C on the cylinder side.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a double layer exhaust valve seats having a low cost raw material for use in two &amp; four-wheelers using PM Technology.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to minimize the cost of the raw material, by using a blend of commercially available alloy and Fe powder using PM Technology.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide double layer exhaust valve seats with good diffusion of alloying elements.<br><br>
Still, yet another object of the present invention is to provide double layer exhaust valve seats that can retain the hardness and resistance both at room temperature and high temperatures ranging 350-450°C.<br>
Further, another object of the present invention is to provide for a process for manufacturing double layer exhaust valve seats using Powder Metallurgy.<br>

To determine that the performance of this valve seat will be as good as the bench mark combination at higher temperatures, softening resistance trials are conducted. The present invention is to provide a double layer valve seats for automotive comprising a valve side component having a high temperature and friction resistance and a cylinder side component with a good creep resistance. The present invention also provides for a process of manufacturing double layer exhaust valve seats for automotive.<br>
In this test the samples are held at various high temperatures for 30 minutes and the samples cooled to room temperature to measure the hardness. The softening resistance of the benchmark valve side alloy and cylinder side alloy is compared with SFL materials in Figs.4 and 5 respectively. The softening resistance is obviously as good for SFL material as that of the bench mark. Further, as the SFL material will have better thermal conductivity due to low porosity and presence of Cu, the valve seat will be cooler during operation than the bench mark valve seat making the SFL valve seat performance superior.<br><br>
The benchmark alloys used for determining the efficacy of SFL valve seat are in the composition of Fe + Co 6-8% + Cr 3-5% + Mo 3-4% + Ni 1-2% + C 1.2-1.5% and the compositon of the Cylinder side is in the range of Fe + Mo 0.5-0.8 + Cu 3-5% + C 1.2-1.5% are blended and valve seats obtained as per the said process and the comparitive hardness of SFL Material vis-a-vis Benchmark Material is tabulated in Table 1 &amp; Table 2 indicating good diffusion of the alloying elements..<br><br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
1.	The cost of HSS is high. Hence, it is used only on the valve side where it requires high wear resistance and high temperature strength thereby reducing the cost of the product considerably.<br>
2.	PM Technology is used to meet the specific property of the alloy material to attain the desired product having net shape.<br><br>
