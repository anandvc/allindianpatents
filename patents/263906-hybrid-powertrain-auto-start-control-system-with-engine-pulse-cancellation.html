				<td>HYBRID POWERTRAIN AUTO START CONTROL SYSTEM WITH ENGINE<br>
PULSE CANCELLATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/073,104 filed on June 17, 2008. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to vehicle control systems and<br>
more particularly to electronic throttle control.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Hybrid powertrains typically include an internal combustion<br>
engine (ICE), an electric motor (EM), and one or more torque generators that<br>
provide torque to a driveline to propel a vehicle. Two types of hybrid powertrains<br>
include a full hybrid powertrain and a mild hybrid powertrain. In a full hybrid<br>
powertrain, the EM drives the drivetrain directly, without transferring torque<br>
through a component of the ICE. In a mild hybrid configuration the EM is<br>
coupled to the ICE through an accessory drive. Torque generated by the EM is<br>
transferred to the drivetrain through the ICE. An exemplary mild hybrid<br>
powertrain includes a so-called belt alternator starter (BAS) system. In the BAS<br><br>
system, the EM is coupled to the ICE via a belt and pulley configuration, which<br>
drives other accessory components, such as pumps and compressors.<br>
[0005] Powertrain torque control typically includes two torque control<br>
domains: axle torque and propulsion torque. In a mild hybrid powertrain, the<br>
propulsion torque is the output torque at the crankshaft of the ICE, which<br>
includes the EM torque contribution.<br>
[0006] During an auto start of the engine, a control module spins up the<br>
engine using the electric motor. A crankshaft of the engine is rotated at higher<br>
speeds during auto start than during a conventional startup of an engine via a<br>
starter. Since fuel is not initially enabled during an auto start, compression and<br>
expansion pulses of the engine cause the spin-up of the engine to include<br>
increases and decreases in a rate of change of the engine speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] In one embodiment, a control system for a hybrid powertrain is<br>
provided and includes an engine start detector that detects when an engine of<br>
the hybrid powertrain is activated via an electric motor during an auto start. An<br>
electric motor speed monitor determines a first speed of the electric motor for a<br>
first time and a second speed of the electric motor for a second time after<br>
detection of the engine in an active state. A control module determines a rate of<br>
change in speed of the electric motor based on the first speed and the second<br>
speed. The control module adjusts torque output of the electric motor during<br>
startup of the engine and based on the rate of change in speed.<br><br>
[0008] In other features, a hybrid powertrain system of a vehicle is<br>
provided and includes an engine and an electric motor that applies a torque on<br>
the engine during an auto start. An engine start detector detects when the<br>
engine is activated via the electric motor. A sensor generates a speed signal that<br>
indicates speed of the engine and/or the electric motor. A control module that<br>
determines a rate of change in speed of the engine and/or the electric motor<br>
based on the engine start detector detecting the engine in an active state and the<br>
speed signal. The control module adjusts torque output of the electric motor<br>
during startup of the engine and based on the rate of change in speed.<br>
t0009] In further features, a method of operating a hybrid powertrain<br>
control system is provided and includes detecting when an engine of the hybrid<br>
powertrain is activated by an electric motor during an auto start. A first speed of<br>
the engine is determined for a first time and a second speed of the engine is<br>
determined for a second time after detection of the engine in an active mode. A<br>
rate of change in speed of said engine is determined based on the first speed<br>
and the second speed. Torque output of the electric motor is adjusted during<br>
startup of the engine and based on the rate of change in speed.<br>

understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0021] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0022] Also, as used herein, the term combustion cycle refers to the<br>
reoccurring stages of an engine combustion process. For example, in a 4-stroke<br>
internal combustion engine, a single combustion cycle may refer to and include<br>
an intake stroke, a compression stroke, a power stroke and an exhaust stroke.<br>
The four-strokes are repeated during operation of the engine.<br>
[0023] In addition, although the following embodiments are described<br>
primarily with respect to example internal combustion engines, the embodiments<br><br>
of the present disclosure may apply to other internal combustion engines. For<br>
example, the present invention may apply to compression ignition, spark ignition,<br>
homogenous spark ignition, homogeneous charge compression ignition, stratified<br>
spark ignition, and spark assisted compression ignition engines.<br>
[0024] Furthermore, in the following description the term auto start<br>
refers to the startup of an engine by a control module via an electric motor. An<br>
auto start does not refer to a change in an ignition state. In a hybrid vehicle an<br>
engine may be depowered/deactivated during different situations, such as during<br>
low-power demand periods, etc. For example only, an auto start may occur after<br>
a vehicle has approached and stopped at a red traffic light and the engine has<br>
been shut down or deactivated. When a brake pedal of the vehicle is not<br>
depressed and/or when an accelerator pedal of the vehicle is depressed, an auto<br>
start may be initiated.<br>
[0025] During an auto start, an electric motor spins-up an engine at<br>
increased speeds over that commonly associated with a conventional starter.<br>
The electric motor provides a smoother and less fuel consuming start of the<br>
engine than starts performed using a starter. In spinning-up the engine, the<br>
electric motor may provide different levels of torque. This torque may be applied<br>
before fuel injection to the engine is enabled and before manifold absolute<br>
pressure of the engine is less than a predetermined manifold absolute pressure.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system 10 providing auto start engine pulse reduction/cancellation is shown.<br>
Although the powertrain system 10 is illustrated as a rear wheel drive (RWD)<br><br>
powertrain, it is appreciated that the embodiments of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented with any other powertrain configuration. The powertrain system<br>
10 includes a propulsion system 12 and a drivetrain system 14. The propulsion<br>
system 12 includes an internal combustion engine (ICE) 16 and an electric motor<br>
(EM) 18. The propulsion system 12 can also include auxiliary components<br>
including, but not limited to, an A/C compressor 20 and a steering pump 22. The<br>
EM 18 and the auxiliary components are coupled to the ICE 16 using a belt and<br>
pulley system 24. The belt and pulley system 24 may be coupled to a crankshaft<br>
26 of the ICE 16 and enable torque to be transferred between the crankshaft 26<br>
and the EM 18 and/or the auxiliary components. This configuration is referred to<br>
as a belt alternator starter (BAS) system.<br>
[0027] The crankshaft 26 drives the drivetrain system 14. The<br>
drivetrain system 14 includes a flexplate or flywheel (not shown), a torque<br>
converter or other coupling device 30, a transmission 32, a propeller shaft 34, a<br>
differential 36, axle shafts 38, brakes 40 and driven wheels 42. A propulsion<br>
torque (TPROp) that is output at the crankshaft 26 of the ICE 16 is transferred<br>
through the drivetrain system components to provide an axle torque (TAXLE) at the<br>
axle shafts 38 to drive the wheels 42. More specifically, TPROp is multiplied by<br>
several gear ratios provided by the coupling device 30, the transmission 32 and<br>
the differential 36 to provide TAXLE at the axle shafts 38. Essentially, TPROp is<br>
multiplied by an effective gear ratio, which is a function of a ratio introduced by<br>
the coupling device 30, a transmission gear ratio determined by transmission<br>
input/output shaft speeds, a differential ratio, as well as any other component that<br><br>
may introduce a ratio in the drivetrain system 14 (e.g., a transfer case in a four<br>
wheel drive (4WD) or all wheel drive (AWD) powertrain). For the purposes of<br>
torque control, the TAXLE domain includes the ICE 16 and the EM 18.<br>
[0028] The powertrain 10 also includes a control system 50, which<br>
regulates torque output of the EM 18 during auto starts of the engine 16. The<br>
control system 50 includes a main control module 51 that may include a<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 52, an engine control module (ECM) 54 and<br>
a hybrid control module (HCM) 56. The control system 50 may regulate the<br>
torque output of the EM 18 based on speed of the EM 18, which may be detected<br>
by a speed sensor 51. The information from the speed sensor 51 may be<br>
provided directly to the HCM 56. This allows for quick detection of the speed of<br>
the EM 18 and adjustment of the output torque of the EM 18. The output torque<br>
may be applied to a crankshaft of the engine 16.<br>
[0029] The main control module 51 controls output torque generated<br>
via the TCM 52, ECM 54 and HCM 56. The HCM 56 can include one or more<br>
sub-modules including, but not limited to, a BAS control processor (BCP) 58.<br>
The TCM 52, ECM 54 and HCM 56 communicate with one another via a<br>
controller area network (CAN) bus 60. A driver input 62 communicates with the<br>
ECM. The driver input 62 can include, but is not limited to, an accelerator pedal<br>
and/or a cruise control system. A driver interface 64 communicates with the<br>
TCM 52. The driver interface 64 includes, but is not limited to, a transmission<br>
range selector (e.g., a PRNDL lever).<br><br>
[0030] The control system 50 may operate based on coordinated<br>
torque control which may include an axle torque domain and a propulsion torque<br>
domain. TPROp is the crankshaft output torque, which may include the EM torque<br>
contribution. The coordinated torque control according to the present disclosure<br>
implements axle torque (TAXLE) arbitration in the ECM to provide an arbitrated<br>
axle torque (TAXLEARB) and splits the propulsion torque control responsibility to the<br>
ECM and the HCM. This split propulsion coordinated torque control facilitates<br>
component protection, engine overspeed prevention and system remedial action,<br>
among other torque requests, on the ECM. Hybrid propulsion torque control<br>
resumes in the HCM where the ECM leaves off and implements transmission<br>
torque control, regenerative braking, and engine overspeed prevention, among<br>
other torque requests.<br>
[0031] The coordinated torque control may monitor the accelerator<br>
pedal position (ΑPED) and the vehicle speed (VVEH). A driver intended or desired<br>
axle torque (TAXLEDES) is determined based on ΑPED and VVEH- For example, ΑPED<br>
and VVEH can be used as inputs to pre-calibrated, pre-stored look-up table, which<br>
provides a corresponding TAXLEDES- The ECM 54 arbitrates TAXLEDES and other<br>
torque requests to provide TAXLEARB- The other torque requests include one or<br>
more torque requests provided in an axle torque request set. The torque<br>
requests are generated by a torque feature and include, but are not limited to, an<br>
absolute torque value, a minimum torque limit value, a maximum torque limit<br>
value or a delta torque value request. The torque features associated with the<br>
axle torque request set include, but are not limited to, a traction control system<br><br>
(TCS), a vehicle stability enhancement system (VSES) and a vehicle overspeed<br>
protection system (VOS). Upon determining TAXLEARB, TAXLEARB is converted into<br>
a propulsion torque (TPROPECM) within the ECM 54 using the effective gear ratio.<br>
After having determined TPROPECM, the ECM 54 arbitrates TPROPECM and a plurality<br>
of other propulsion torque requests, for which the ECM 54 is responsible, to<br>
provide a final TPROPECM to the HCM 56.<br>
[0032] The HCM 56 may issue a torque request to set the engine<br>
torque to zero by deactivating the engine cylinders (e.g., by shutting-off the fuel<br>
to the cylinders). This can occur during vehicle coast down situations when the<br>
accelerator pedal position is zero. For example, the fuel is shut-off and the<br>
regenerative braking of the vehicle commences to transfer the kinetic energy of<br>
the vehicle into electric power via the EM 18. To facilitate this, a torque converter<br>
clutch that links the wheel torque to the crankshaft is engaged. Through this, the<br>
EM 18 is driven. Accordingly, a torque request going into the ECM 54 propulsion<br>
torque arbitration is provided from the HCM 56, such that two torque requesters<br>
input into the ECM 54 propulsion torque arbitration: the driver/cruise (axle torque<br>
arbitrated) propulsion torque request and an HCM 56 zero fuel torque request.<br>
[0033] The TCM 52 provides an arbitrated propulsion torque value<br>
(TPROPTCM)- More specifically, the TCM 52 arbitrates a plurality of torque requests<br>
from torque features. An exemplary TCM torque feature is a transmission<br>
protection algorithm that generates a maximum torque limit to limit the torque at<br>
the transmission input shaft. The maximum torque limit indicates the maximum<br><br>
allowable torque through the transmission input shaft in order to protect<br>
transmission components.<br>
[0034] Both TPROPECM from the ECM 54 and TPROPECM from the TCM 52<br>
are sent to the HCM 56, which completes the TPROP arbitration. More specifically,<br>
the HCM 56 arbitrates TPROPECM. TPROPECM and other torque requests to provide<br>
TPROPFINAL- The other torque requests include one or more torque requests<br>
provided in a propulsion torque request set. The torque requests are each<br>
generated by a torque feature and include, but are not limited to, an absolute<br>
torque value, a minimum torque limit value, a maximum torque limit value or a<br>
delta torque value request. The torque features associated with the propulsion<br>
torque request set include, but are not limited to, regenerative braking, engine<br>
overspeed protection and EM boost.<br>
[0035] The HCM 56 determines TICE and TEM based on TPROPFINAL-<br>
More specifically, the HCM 56 includes an optimization algorithm, which<br>
partitions TPROPFINAL based on the available torque output of each of the ICE 16<br>
and the EM 18. TICE is sent to the ECM 54, which generates control signals for<br>
achieving TICE using the ICE 16. The HCM 56 generates control signals based<br>
on TEM for achieving TEM using the EM 18.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Figure 2, a functional block diagram of an ICE<br>
system 150 incorporating control based on a secured count of fueled cylinders is<br>
shown. The ICE system 150 is on a vehicle 152 and includes the ICE 16 and an<br>
exhaust system 158.<br><br>
[0037] The ICE 16 has cylinders 160. Each cylinder 160 may have one<br>
or more intake valves and/or exhaust valves. Each cylinder 160 also includes a<br>
piston that rides on a crankshaft 162. The ICE 16 may be configured with an<br>
ignition system 164 with an ignition circuit 165. The ICE 16 is also configured<br>
with a fuel injection system 167 with a fuel injection circuit 168, and the exhaust<br>
system 158. The ICE 16 includes an intake manifold 166. The ICE 16 combusts<br>
an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. The ICE 16, as shown, includes<br>
four cylinders in an in-line configuration. Although FIG. 2 depicts four cylinders<br>
(N = 4), it can be appreciated that the engine 54 may include additional or fewer<br>
cylinders. For example, engines having 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are<br>
contemplated. It is also anticipated that the fuel injection control of the present<br>
invention can be implemented in a V-type or another type of cylinder<br>
configuration.<br>
[0038] An output of the ICE 16 is coupled by a torque converter 170, a<br>
transmission 32', a driveshaft 34' and a differential 36' to driven wheels 178. The<br>
transmission 32' may, for example, be a continuously variable transmission<br>
(CVT) or a step-gear automatic transmission. The transmission 32' is controlled<br>
by the main control module 51.<br>
[0039] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 166 via an electronic<br>
throttle controller (ETC) 190, or a cable-driven throttle, which adjusts a throttle<br>
plate 192 that is located adjacent to an inlet of an intake manifold 166. The<br>
adjustment may be based upon a position of an accelerator pedal 194 and a<br>
throttle control algorithm that is executed by the control module 51. The throttle<br><br>
192 adjusts output torque that drives the wheels 178. An accelerator pedal<br>
sensor 196 generates a pedal position signal that is output to the control module<br>
51 based on a position of the accelerator pedal 194. A position of a brake pedal<br>
198 is sensed by a brake pedal sensor or switch 200, which generates a brake<br>
pedal position signal that is output to the control module 51. During an auto start,<br>
the control module may adjust the output torque from the EM 18 based on the<br>
signals from the accelerator pedal sensor 196 and the brake pedal sensor 200.<br>
[0040] Air is drawn into the cylinders 160 from the intake manifold 166<br>
and is compressed therein. Fuel is injected into cylinders 160 by the fuel<br>
injection circuit 168 and spark may be generated by the ignition system 164,<br>
when included, to ignite the air/fuel mixtures in the cylinders 160. In diesel<br>
applications, the ignition circuit may include glow plugs. Exhaust gases are<br>
exhausted from the cylinders 160 into the exhaust system 158. In some<br>
instances, the ICE system 150 can include a turbocharger that uses an exhaust<br>
driven turbine to drive a compressor that compresses the air entering the intake<br>
manifold 166. The compressed air may pass through an air cooler before<br>
entering into the intake manifold 166.<br>
[0041] The fuel injection circuit 168 may include fuel injectors that are<br>
associated with each of the cylinders 160. A fuel rail provides fuel to each of the<br>
fuel injectors after reception from, for example, a fuel pump or reservoir. The<br>
control module 51 controls operation of the fuel injectors. The number and timing<br>
of fuel injections into each of the cylinders 51 is controlled, as well as the number<br>
of fuel injections per combustion cycle and the timing of the fuel injection(s)<br><br>
during each combustion cycle. The fuel injection timing may be relative to<br>
crankshaft positioning. Fuel injection may be initiated after spin-up of the engine<br>
26 and after a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) decreases below a<br>
predetermined MAP value. The MAP pressure may be monitored by the control<br>
module 51 via a MAP sensor 169.<br>
[0042] The ignition system 164 may include spark plugs or other<br>
ignition devices for ignition of the air/fuel mixtures in each of the cylinders 160.<br>
The ignition system 164 also may include the control module 51. The control<br>
module 51 may, for example, control spark timing relative to crankshaft<br>
positioning.<br>
[0043] The exhaust system 158 may include exhaust manifolds and/or<br>
exhaust conduits and a filter system 212. The exhaust manifolds and conduits<br>
direct the exhaust exiting the cylinders 160 into the filter system 212. Optionally,<br>
an EGR valve re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold<br>
166. A portion of the exhaust may be directed into a turbocharger to drive a<br>
turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the<br>
intake manifold 166. A combined exhaust stream flows from the turbocharger<br>
through the filter system 212.<br>
[0044] The filter system 212 may include a catalytic converter or an<br>
oxidation catalyst (OC) 214 and a heating element 216, as well as a particulate<br>
filter, a liquid reductant system and/or other exhaust filtration system devices.<br>
The heating element 216 may be used to heat the oxidation catalyst 214 during<br>
startup of the ICE 16 and a light off process of the OC 214 and be controlled by<br><br>
the control module 51. The liquid reductant may include urea, ammonia, or some<br>
other liquid reductant. Liquid reductant is injected into the exhaust stream to<br>
react with NOx to generate water vapor (H2O) and N2 (nitrogen gas).<br>
[0045] The ICE system 150 further includes an engine temperature<br>
sensor 218, an exhaust temperature sensor 220, and one or more oxygen<br>
sensors 221. The engine temperature sensor 218 may detect oil or coolant<br>
temperature of the ICE 16 or some other engine temperature. The exhaust<br>
temperature sensor 220 may detect temperature of the oxidation catalyst 214 or<br>
some other component of the exhaust system 158. The temperatures of the ICE<br>
16 and the exhaust system 158 may be indirectly determined or estimated based<br>
on engine and exhaust operating parameters and/or other temperature signals.<br>
Alternatively, the temperatures of the ICE 16 and the exhaust system 158 may<br>
be determined directly via the engine and exhaust temperature sensors 218, 220.<br>
[0046] Other sensor inputs collectively indicated by reference number<br>
222 and used by the control module 51 include an engine speed signal 224, a<br>
vehicle speed signal 226, a power supply signal 228, oil pressure signal 230, an<br>
engine temperature signal 232, and a cylinder identification signal 234. The<br>
sensor input signals 224-234 are respectively generated by engine speed sensor<br>
236, vehicle speed sensor 238, a power supply sensor 240, an oil pressure<br>
sensor 242, an engine temperature sensor 244, and cylinder identification sensor<br>
246. Some other sensor inputs may include an intake manifold pressure signal,<br>
a throttle position signal, a transmission signal, and manifold air temperature<br>
signal.<br><br>
[0047] The control module 51 may modulate torque based upon, for<br>
example, a pedal position signal from the pedal position sensor 196 and/or<br>
signals from other sensors. The pedal position sensor 196 generates the pedal<br>
position signal based upon actuation of the accelerator pedal 194 by a driver.<br>
The other sensors may include, for example, a mass air flow (MAF) sensor, the<br>
MAP sensor 169, an engine speed sensor, a transmission sensor, and a cruise<br>
control system sensor, and/or a traction control system sensor.<br>
[0048] Referring now also to Figure 3, a functional block diagram of a<br>
hybrid powertrain control system 300 that performs auto start engine pulse<br>
reduction and/or cancellation is shown. The hybrid powertrain control system<br>
300 includes the main control module 51. The main control module 51 is in<br>
communication with the electric motor 18, the ignition system 164, the fuel<br>
injection system 167 and other sensors and actuators 298. The other sensors<br>
and actuators 298 may include the sensors and actuators above-described. The<br>
main control module 51 includes an engine control module 301, an electric motor<br>
control module 302, an electric motor/engine speed monitor 304, an engine start<br>
detector 306 and hardware input/output (HWIO) devices 308. The main control<br>
module 51 is in communication with the electric motor 18, the ignition system<br>
164, the fuel injection system 167 and the other sensors and actuators 298 via<br>
the HWIO devices 308. The main control module 51 may be in communication<br>
with memory 310.<br>
[0049] The engine control module 300 may include a torque control<br>
module 312, a fuel control module 314 and an ignition control module 316. The<br><br>
torque control module may control the output torque of the engine and/or the<br>
torque provided to the transmission. The fuel control module 314 may control<br>
fuel pump and fuel injector timing, fuel pressures, etc. The ignition control<br>
module 316 may control ignition or spark timing within the cylinders of the<br>
engine. The fuel and ignition control may be in association with disabling and<br>
enabling of one or more cylinders.<br>
[0050] The HWIO devices 308 include an interface control module 320<br>
and hardware interfaces/drivers 322. The interface control module 320 provides<br>
an interface between the fuel control and ignition control software and the<br>
hardware interfaces/drivers 322. The hardware interfaces/drivers 322 control<br>
operation of, for example, fuel injectors, fuel pumps, ignition coils, spark plugs,<br>
throttle valves, solenoids and other torque control devices and actuators. The<br>
hardware interface/drivers 322 also receive sensor signals, which are<br>
communicated to the respective modules 312, 314 and 316.<br>
[0051] Although the embodiments of the following FIGs. 4-8 are<br>
described primarily with respect to motor speed, as an electric motor of a mild-<br>
hybrid system is coupled to an engine, the embodiments may apply directly to<br>
engine speed also. For example, engine speed changes proportionally with a<br>
change in electric motor speed. For this reason, electric motor speed and/or<br>
engine speed may be detected, monitored, and used in the various below<br>
described calculations, determinations and tasks.<br>
[0052] The electric motor speed may be detected, monitored and used<br>
in the described calculations over the engine speed to provide a quicker<br><br>
response. Electric motor speed may be detected and provided directly to a<br>
hybrid control module. This may be quicker and/or more accurate than, for<br>
example, detection of engine speed by a crankshaft rotation sensor.<br>
[0053] Referring now to FIGs. 4 and 5, a motor speed signal 350 is<br>
shown. The motor speed signal 350 corresponds to speed of an electric motor<br>
and an engine of a vehicle during an auto start. The motor speed signal 350<br>
includes multiple phases, which have corresponding engine pulses. The engine<br>
pulses occur due to compression and expansion strokes of the engine and refer<br>
to the decreasing and increasing changes in engine speed during the auto start<br>
process. As an example, four phases are shown and may be referred to as an<br>
initial phase 352, a compression phase 354, an expansion phase 356, and a final<br>
phase 358. Although the phases are based on strokes of the engine, each<br>
phase may be associated with different and/or multiple combustion cycle strokes.<br>
For example, during one of the phases a first cylinder may be in an intake stroke<br>
while a second cylinder is in one or more of an intake, a compression, an<br>
expansion or an exhaust stroke.<br>
[0054] During an auto start, compression and expansion strokes of the<br>
engine causes the motor speed to fluctuate. During a compression stroke of one<br>
or more cylinders of the engine the motor speed may decrease, as identified by<br>
motor speed signal portion 340. During an expansion stroke of one or more<br>
cylinders of the engine the motor speed may increase, as identified by motor<br>
speed signal portion 342.<br><br>
[0055] As a result in speed changes of the motor, an engine transitions<br>
through different spin-up phases. Two spin-up phases are identified by arrows<br>
344 and 346. The first spin-up phase 344 corresponds with motor speed prior to<br>
a compression stroke. The second spin-up phase 346 corresponds with motor<br>
speed during and after an expansion stroke. A first transition point 348 exists at<br>
the beginning of a compression stroke or between the first and second phases<br>
352, 354. A second transition point 350 between a compression stroke and an<br>
expansion stroke or between the second and third phases 340, 342.<br>
[0056] Torque output of an engine may be adjusted during an auto<br>
start based on a power limit curve, engine speed and a constant power source<br>
output. FIG. 6 provides a power limit curve relating engine torque output to<br>
engine speed.<br>
[0057] Referring now to FIG. 6, an exemplary engine torque versus<br>
engine speed diagram is shown. A power limit curve 400 is shown and<br>
represents a maximum power that may be provided by a power source, such as<br>
a battery. When operating based on a constant power source output, when<br>
speed of an electric motor/engine changes, torque output of the engine changes.<br>
[0058] For example, during engine pulses, when the engine speed<br>
decreases from n2 to n1 because of an approaching compression phase, the<br>
torque output of the engine may increase from T2 to T1. As another example,<br>
when the engine speed increases from n1 to n2 because of an approaching<br>
expansion phase, the torque output of the engine may decrease from T1 to T2.<br><br>
[0059] To rely on this relationship between engine speed and torque<br>
output of an engine for a constant power output of a power source has<br>
associated disadvantages. One disadvantage is that torque authority is limited.<br>
Torque output control of the engine is limited to the power limit curve. Another<br>
disadvantage is that torque output of the engine does not change until engine<br>
speed changes.<br>
[0060] The embodiments described herein provide increased flexibility<br>
in adjusting engine torque output during an auto start. The embodiments also<br>
anticipate a change in engine speed before a change in engine speed occurs.<br>
This allows for earlier adjustment in engine torque output via an adjustment in<br>
electric motor operation. The anticipation of engine speed changing also allows<br>
the control system to prevent a drop in engine speed during spin-up.<br>
[0061] Referring now to FIG. 7, a motor speed diagram that illustrates<br>
engine pulse reduction affect on motor speed in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present disclosure is shown. The vertical dashed lines 420 represent<br>
transitions between initial, compression, expansion and final phases.<br>
[0062] The embodiments herein include the monitoring of a change in<br>
engine speed or the derivative of a detected engine speed signal. The<br>
monitoring of the change in engine speed allows for the detection in a rate of<br>
change in engine speed. This allows for early detection of an approaching<br>
compression phase or an expansion phase of an engine. When a rate of change<br>
in electric motor and/or engine speed is detected, electric motor torque output<br>
may be adjusted. The electric motor torque output may be adjusted, for<br><br>
example, to compensate for a decrease in engine speed due to a compression<br>
phase or to compensate for an increase in engine speed due to an expansion<br>
phase.<br>
[0063] The motor speed diagram includes a first motor speed signal<br>
422 that corresponds to an engine operating in a normal state without engine<br>
pulse suppression and/or cancellation. A second motor speed signal 424 is also<br>
shown that corresponds with an engine operating in an engine pulse suppression<br>
and/or compression state.<br>
[0064] During an initial phase the electric motor output torque may be<br>
at a predetermined output torque level. The predetermined output torque level<br>
may correspond with a normal electric motor output torque for spin-up. When the<br>
rate of increase in engine speed begins to slow down or when the slope of the<br>
engine speed curve decreases, electric motor output torque may be increased<br>
above the predetermined output torque level. This increased output is shown by<br>
a compression portion of an electric motor output torque curve 426. The electric<br>
motor output torque curve 426 illustrates when a positive torque and a negative<br>
torque may be provided that has a magnitude that is greater than the<br>
predetermined output torque level. The predetermined output torque level<br>
corresponds with the horizontal axis 428. The unit-of-measure of the vertical axis<br>
of motor speed does not apply to the electric motor output torque curve 426,<br>
which may have a unit-of-measure of Newton-meters (Nm).<br>
[0065] The electric motor output torque may be increased when the<br>
slope of the motor speed signal 424 decreases or when the slope of the motor<br><br>
speed signal 424 decreases to a predetermined level. A first slop curve 430 is<br>
shown that corresponds with a point when the slope of the first engine speed<br>
curve 422 decreases. A second slope curve 432 is shown that corresponds with<br>
a point when the first engine speed signal 422 changes from increasing to<br>
decreasing, for example at a first inflection point. The change in electric motor<br>
output torque based on the first slope curve 430 provides earlier compensation<br>
due to a decrease in engine speed.<br>
[0066] During a compression phase, when the rate of decrease in<br>
engine speed begins to slow down or when the slope of the engine speed curve<br>
424 increases, electric motor output torque may be decreased below the<br>
predetermined output toque level. The electric motor output torque may be<br>
decreased when the slope increases or when the slope increases to a<br>
predetermined level. A third slope curve 434 is shown that corresponds with a<br>
point when the slope of the second engine speed curve 424 increases. A fourth<br>
slope curve 436 is shown that corresponds with a point when the engine speed<br>
changes from decreasing to increasing, for example at a second inflection point.<br>
The change in electric motor output torque based on the third slope curve 434<br>
provides earlier compensation due to an increase in engine speed.<br>
[0067] At approximately the beginning of the final phase the electric<br>
motor output torque may be returned to the predetermined output torque level.<br>
[0068] Referring now to FIG. 8, a logic flow diagram illustrating a<br>
method of controlling a hybrid powertrain system including performing electric<br>
motor torque control during an auto start is shown. Although the following steps<br><br>
are primarily described with respect to the embodiments of FIGs. 1-3 and 7, the<br>
steps may be easily modified to apply to other embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The method may begin at step 500.<br>
[0069] Steps 501-506 may be used to trigger engine pulse suppression<br>
and/or cancellation. In step 501, when an engine of the hybrid powertrain is<br>
activated via an electric motor that adjusts torque output of the engine, control<br>
proceeds to step 502.<br>
[0070] In step 502, electric motor speed and/or engine speed is<br>
monitored and an electric motor speed signal or engine speed signal is<br>
generated. This may be performed by the electric motor speed monitor. The<br>
electric motor speed and/or the engine speed may be continuously and/or<br>
repeatedly monitored and updated during all of the steps of this method.<br>
[0071] In step 504, when the electric motor speed RPMc is within a<br>
predetermined range RPMi<rpmc control proceeds to step in one></rpmc>
embodiment, RPMi is approximately 50 revolutions per minute and the RPM2 is<br>
approximately 1100 revolutions per minute.<br>
[0072] In the following steps, rate of changes in motor speed are<br>
determined. This may include determining a first speed S1 of an electric motor<br>
or engine for a first time T1 and a second speed S2 of the electric motor or<br>
engine for a second time T2. The rate of change in motor speed is equal to a<br>
difference in the first and second speeds S2-S1 divided by the difference in time<br>
T2-T1 is set. The current motor speed RPMC may be S1 or S2.<br><br>
[0073] In step 505, a speed derivative is determined based on the<br>
speed of the engine and/or electric motor. In step 506, when the rate of change<br>
(speed derivative) in motor speed or slope of a motor speed curve associated<br>
with the engine speed signal decreases or when the rate of change in engine<br>
speed decreases below a first threshold, control may proceed to step 508. As an<br>
alternative and as shown in FIG. 8, when the rate of change in motor speed is<br>
less than a first calibration value C1, control proceeds to step 508. This<br>
alternative is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
[0074] In step 508, control increases torque output of the electric<br>
motor. The output torque may be increased and biased above the<br>
predetermined output torque level. The increase may be based on manifold<br>
absolute pressure (MAP). This may be determined based on a MAP signal from<br>
a MAP sensor, such the map sensor or by calibration values stored in memory<br>
and used by motor control.<br>
[0075] In step 510, when the rate of change in motor speed is greater<br>
than or equal to a second calibration value C2, control proceeds to step 511. In<br>
step 511, when the motor speed is decreasing, control maintains the increased<br>
torque output of the electric motor. Control proceeds to step 512 when the rate<br>
of change in motor speed is less than the second calibration value C2 or the<br>
motor speed is constant or increasing. The calibration values C1 and C2 may be<br>
predetermined, stored in a lookup table, and stored in memory, such as the<br>
memory. In one embodiment, the second calibration value C2 is less than the<br>
first calibration value C1.<br><br>
[0076] In step 512, when the rate of change in motor speed increases<br>
control may proceed to step 514. In step 514, when the motor speed is less than<br>
a maximum motor speed RPMPEAK. control proceeds to step 516. In one<br>
embodiment, the maximum motor speed RPMPEAK may be approximately 50-<br>
1100 revolutions per minute.<br>
[0077] In step 516, control decreases output torque of the electric<br>
motor. The output torque may be decreased and biased below the<br>
predetermined output torque level. Control may maintain the decrease in output<br>
torque while the motor speed is less than the maximum motor speed and/or while<br>
the rate of change in motor speed is constant and/or increasing.<br>
[0078] In step 518, when the motor speed is greater than or equal to<br>
the maximum motor speed RPMPEAK, control may return to step 501 or ends this<br>
procedure.<br>
[0079] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br>
simultaneously, continuously, during overlapping time periods or in a different<br>
order depending upon the application.<br>
[0080] The embodiments of the present disclosure suppress and/or<br>
cancel engine pulses. Driveability is improved due to a reduction in the<br>
fluctuations in the rate of change of electric motor speed during an auto start.<br>
This provides for a smooth engine spin-up.<br>
[0081] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br><br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
