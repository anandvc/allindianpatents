DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to Figure l thereof, there is illustrated an implementation of the present invention providing a jab scheduling and administrative tool for POEMS enabled products (Platinum point products, for example) under a common application programming interface.<br>
In Fig. 1, a suite of point products 100 (point products i..n), each including a point product GUI lio, are linked together with various POEMS enabling application programming interfaces (API"s), and a Platinum Enterprise Communicator (PEC) ISO. At least one Lightweight Enterprise Scheduler (LES) agent 170 is installed on a node. The point product GUI 110 provides a user interface to the point product 100 and communicates user selections by sending job data to a GUI API 115.<br>
The GUI API 115 incorporates LES provided property pages, performs data checks and job allocation, and calls relevant scheduling functions in the job scheduling API 130 according to the job parameters. The GUI API 115 is used by the point product GUI no.<br>
The job scheduling API 13 0 performs scheduling services, allocates and defines jobs submitted and distributes jobs by initiating a PEC message to an LES agent on a selected node to run the job (LES node 1, 170, for example).   Inter-process communicat-.i nne =va<br><br>
preferably used by the point product GUI 110.<br>
The LES agent 170 initiates processing of the job as requested by the Job Scheduling API 130. The present invention may be implemented across multiple computing platforms and/or nodes, and an LES agent is installed on each node on which jobs run (LES agents 1..n).<br>
Each LES Agent updates a local job repository 180 that maintains job information on each job submitted to it"s respective node. The local job repositories are installed on each node where j obs run and may be implemented using SQL*Anywhere (a database product having a small footprint, for efficiency of resources). Other SQL products and various database/repository configurations may be substituted.<br>
A central job repository 190 maintains a super set of job data on all jobs submitted to each node in the system. The central job repository is maintained by a job data management API 140, and is implemented in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), Dex, or other data repository or management system.<br>
The job data management API 140 selects, inserts, updates, or deletes jobs and job histories. Both local and central j ob repositories are updated by j ob data management API. Also, the job data management API 140 is used internally by the job scheduler and the LES agent. The job scheduling API reformats data into PEC message format.<br>
A location of the central job repository 190 is determined by RDEX (Relational Data Exchange). If no 3EX (Data Exchange) information is available, the SDM (Software Delivery Manager) install prompts are itilized   for   table   location   informal inn<br><br>
environment, PEC 160, LES agents, etc. are maintained on a same node as the central job repository, each client machine, and on each node where jobs run.<br>
Each of the Central and local job repositories are<br>
5   automatically updated by LES.   The point products<br>
themselves only interact with the API" s and are not<br>
concerned  with  the  details  of  either  type  of<br>
repository.<br>
A point product API 12 0 is provided to allow access by each point product to determine job status, job logfile, perform setup and cancel functions (jobs), update the job logfile, and retrieve job parameters as the job runs. In the POEMS configuration, this API is utilised by the point product executable (point product 100, for example).<br>
An LES command line 155 provides command line access to job administration functions (by communicating with a job administration API 150) , including determine job status, and setup, cancel, or update a job logfile and retrieve job parameters.<br>
The job administration API 150 deletes, cancels, reruns, or copies existing jobs. This API is used internally by the LES command line 155 and a job folder 185 (containing a list of jobs, that may be viewed in various formats) .<br>
Each of the point product API 120, Job Scheduling API 130, Job Data Management API 140, and Job Administration API 150, communicate as needed with any of LES agents installed on nodes i..n via PEC messages.<br>
The PEC messages are provided in a format to communicate between LES enabled workstations and the various APIs.<br><br>
A calendaring API 165 is provided to manage calendar functions and is used internally by other API"s and the point product GUI.<br>
The POEMS enabled point products and LES agents installed on nodes of a computing network or system provide common job scheduling services, hereinafter referred to as the Lightweight Enterprise Scheduler (LES). The LES allows a user to schedule a new job, delete a job, cancel a running job, and re-run a job.<br>
A sample LES job flow is provided in the following steps:<br>
1.	Enter job parameters in the point product GUI.<br>
2.	Press the "Finish/OK" button.<br>
3.	Job parameters are passed to the LES Job Distributor.<br>
4.	Parent job entry is placed in the central repository.<br>
5.	Job parameters are passed to the LES agent using PEC.<br>
6.	Job parameters are stored in the local Job Table. (If this step fails, an event/alarm is sent indicating that the job is not scheduled on the node.)<br>
7.	Child job is created and stored in the central repository.<br>
8.	Repeat steps 5-7 for each of selected nodes.<br>
9.	At the appropriate time, the job is started<br>
(which   launches   the   point   product executable}.<br>
10.	Job parameters are obtained from the j ob table using a LES API.<br>
11.	A job progress message is sent out-<br><br>
12.	The job"s progress displays on the console using a progress monitor.<br>
13.	The job completes, and the LES agent places a record in the local Job History Table.<br>
14.	The LES agent places a record in the central Job History Table.<br>
15.	The LES Agent sends a "Job Complete" event.<br>
LES Agent<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating the main components and communications of an LES agent (LES agent 170, for example). The LES agent consists of three main parts:<br>
1.	Communication Module 210 - Sends and receives PEC messages from the Job Distribution API to the point product and from the point product to the Job Distribution API.<br>
2.	Job Management Module 220 - The LES kernel. This part of the agent sets up the internal environment and memory, launches the job, runs the job, and manages job processes.<br>
3.	Data Management Module 230 - Updates and deletes data from the Local and Central Repositories (180 and 190, respectively).<br>
A low-level function API 240 is available to all agent modules. This low-level API handles all internal functions, file management, and messages.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating how PEC messages are normally routed.  A send module 300 R^riri«<br><br>
which is received by an RT server which sends copies of the message 320a and 320b to each of Receive modules 340a and 340b, respectively (LES agents, for example).<br>
To prevent the RT server from delivering the same job message to more than one agent, the LES agent registers as PTLES__<nodeaddress> datagroup. This registration identifies each LES agent with a unique datagroup so that messages may be routed to nodes of a datagroup corresponding to the message.<br>
Each LES Agent subscribes to the current node address (hostname) messages, so each sender should also specify which node will receive the message. Proper message routing is illustrated in Figure 4, which illustrates the P.T server 310 passing the message 320 to Receivel module 345a, and Receive module 345b not receiving a copy. An RT Server runs on each machine where processes are managed, provides PEC routing to a correct destination.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow diagram illustrating the flow of messages incoming to an LES agent 5QQ. All incoming messages are received via a PEC communication API (PEC 160, for example, see Figure 1), from any of a client process 520, point product agent 530, or other module communicating with an LES agent. Each message is routed via an RT server (510a, 510b, for example) to the LES agent 500.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates reverse message traffic, from :he LES agent 500 to the point product agent 530. The JES agent 500 sends point product parameters to the point product process (agent) 53 0 using PEC messages /ia the RT server 510.<br>
Figure 7A is a flow chart illustrating the steps lor LES agent startup.  At step 705, LES configuration<br><br>
of repositories, information for LES to find out how to set-up and operate) are loaded. At step 710, LES local job repository tables are created (local job repository 1 180, see Fig. l, for example). Step 710 is bypassed if local job repositories are already present on the node which the LES agent is being started.<br>
At step 715, the local job repository is synchronized with the central job repository 190. For example. The synchronization process updates the central job repository to reflect each entry in the local job repository, this process assures that the central job repository maintains records for each job across the enterprise.<br>
At step 72 0, a history row is added for all expired jobs (both central and local). Information on expired jobs is maintained for historical purposes.<br>
At step 725, PEC call back functions are initialized. The PEC callback functions provide the appropriate API interface allowing communication with the PEC 160.<br>
At step 730, a synchronization timeout is computed and setup.  The synchronization timeout is utilized to control how long to wait to connect to the other repository.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 7B, once the LES agent is started, it begins performing receipt and startup of job processes selected to be run on the node on which the LES is installed. At step 750, the LES agent computes and perforins setup of a next job to run, and then enters a wait loop 760, where the LES agent waits for one of a PEC message, Synchronization timeout, and a timeout on a next job to run.<br>
When the wait loop times out on a next job to run.<br><br>
current job {next job that timedout), updating a start status of the job, and creating a run history row (updating and creating actions are performed in both local and central repositories).<br>
When the loop times out on a synchronisation, a Central/Local synchronization program is executed (synchronises Local with central, and central with local).<br>
When the loop receives a PEC message, the LES agent performs the action contained in the PEC message, step 780. PEC messages received by the LES agent include messages to run a job, cancel a job, update job status, request job parameters (Job parameters are information that a product would need, user name, db name, set by point product and stored in the LES API in an area of the LES db where point products can use for whatever they want).<br>
Upon  completion  of  either  the  job  timeout, synchronisation timeout, or PEC message action (steps 770,  790,  and 780,  respectively) ,  the LES agent computes and sets up a next job to run (repeating step 750), and re-enters the wait loop 760.<br>
When the POEMS Scheduling Service is utilized to add a job,, the point product GUI 110 calls the Job Scheduling API 130 to submit the job.<br>
The API performs the following steps:<br>
1.	Saves the job in the central repository.<br>
2.	Checks to see if the agent is present.<br>
3.	If the agent is running, sends a PEC message (including the job) to the agent.<br>
The Agent performs the following steps:<br><br>
2.	Saves the job in the local repository.<br>
3.	Checks when to run the job.<br>
4.	Launches the command line.<br>
The LES agent is maintained in an hierarchically organized directory structure, one example being illustrated in Figure 8. A top level directory $PLATHOME 800 contains all relevant directories containing files related to Platinum products (other products could alternatively be used). A POEMS root directory, $ptroot 810 maintains all directories and files related to enabling POEMS.<br>
A cfgref 830 directory maintains a configuration file configuration files 195, for example.<br>
A shlib* 84 0 directory maintains all *.lib, and *.5o files, which are shared libraries.<br>
A bin 850 directory separately maintains each of a ptles* files 852, *.dli 854, and *sql.dll 856 files. The ptles* files 852 include ptlesag, ptlestp, ptlestab, and other related files. The *.ail 854 maintains each of dynamic link libraries, and *sql,* 856 maintains LES queries for LES functions.<br>
A log 860 directory maintains a ptlesag.log 865 logfile (that includes a diagnostic log, info about runs, and errors).<br>
In one embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 9, the Platinum Security Model requires that many applications/point products be run as a specific user in order to succeed.<br>
An AutoLogin API provides a way to run jobs as a!6 specific operating system user without querying the user at run-time or hard-coding the UNIX user as part of the job.<br><br>
To take advantage of this feature, an application may utilize an PtLESSetJobCommand() function and pass a username and role to LES. If the username and role are set to NULL, LES runs the job as the default platinum user (or other default user). Otherwise LES tries to retrieve the userid and password by calling the AutoLogin API and passing the username and role as Requested User and Requested Role, the operating system as Resource Type, and the job instance name as Resource Instance.<br>
Entering Login Information in AutoLogin<br>
In the AutoLogin embodiment, an administrator signs in as "root" to set up the LES/OS resources.<br>
From the POEMS Director:<br>
1.	Select Tools^Security Admin^AutoLogin.<br>
2.	Log in as "root". If already logged in, "rtlogout.exe" may be utilized before running Administrator AutoLogin.<br>
3 .   The AutoLogin Administration window displays .<br>
4.	Right-click on the Agent"s Requesting User folder to invoke a pop-up menu display.<br>
5.	Select Add Entry.<br>
6.	The Add Entry window displays,<br>
7.	Enter login information in the fields, h) The Resource Type is set to OS.<br>
i) The Resource Instance is the same instance name that the point product passes to the job.<br><br>
If the Point Product . .<br>
•Uses AutoLogin and a valid user ID and a password are recorded in the Add Entry window, the LES agent passes the ID and password strings and access is granted.<br>
•Uses AutoLogin but no user information is recorded in the Add Entry window, the LES agent automatically checks for the UNIX user login. If the UNIX user is found, access is granted.<br>
•Uses AutoLogin  and an  invalid user  ID  and password are recorded in the Add Entry window, the LES agent defaults to PLATINUM {or other default) user.<br>
•Does not use AutoLogin, the LES agents defaults to the PLATINUM (or other default) user.<br>
Command Line Interface<br>
The  command  line  interface  included  in  LES performs administrative functions, including:<br>
-	Delete a job with all its runs.<br>
-	Cancel a jobvs run.<br>
-	List all jobs.<br>
-	List all jobs by product code, status, and/or node.<br>
-	Rerun a job immediately.<br>
The command line interface utilizes the following format:<br><br>
ptlescmd [-a action] [-jobid] [-c clea.mrp_pracess] [-r run_number] [-p product_code] [-s status] [-b buffersize] [-n node]<br>
Note: The -a option is for all actions; the -j option is far all actions except List; the others are optional.<br>
Ptlescmd is the LES command line interface used to delete a job, cancel a job run, list jobs fall jobs, by product code, by status, and/or node), and rerun a job immediately.<br>
Table 1 provides a listing of the ptlescmd command line supported options.<br><br><br><br>
aceion is one of the following: delete, cancel, rerun, and list.<br>
jobid is the identifier used for the job.<br>
letter is the letter for one of the options listed<br><br>
option_name is the name of one of the options listed in the Command Line Supported Options table.<br>
Table 2 provides a set of example command lines and a corresponding description.<br><br>
LES jobs stay in the central and local repositories until the user deletes them. The user can delete, rerun, or cancel a running job at any time by right-clicking on the Poems director/Job folder 185 and<br>
)U   selectina  the  annrnnrisl-Q  /-vnt-n^n     a  ^=lQpQ  „««--;~~<br><br>
The point product may provide a cleanup process executable that removes all the point product files related to the job. This executable, if available, is run by the agent before removing the job and job history.<br>
LES provides jcb modification options including Rerun Job and Update Job. The Rerun Job option allows a user to rerun the job with a different start time. A PtLESUpdateJob() function allows updates for all GUI fields.<br>
Context variables, such as %C(PLATHOME) or the environment variable %E(FUS_HOME) etc., which are resolved by the agent before running the job command.<br>
The UNIX username is set from the GUI point product as part of the j ob. The agent does not need the password because the agent is running as root (the agent has the set_root_lD bit).<br>
Context Variables<br>
Context variables are keyword identifiers that may be used on the command line. The LES agent converts these variables according to the context of the current job and job parameters passed. The LES agent inserts these context variables, forms the command line, and then executes the command line.<br>
•Keyword Context Variable - Substitution tak.es<br>
place from the current job.<br>
•Environment Variable - Substitution tak.es place from the environment where the agent is running.<br>
•Filename Variable - The agent uses this variable as the filename and replaces it with the contents<br><br>
How Context Variables Are Specified: Keyword Context Variable:<br>
Specified as %C(context identifier is replaced by-value)-e.g., my_prog %C(JOB_ID) %C(USERNAME) replaced with my_prog 1234 manager where the current Job jobid = 12 3 4 and username = manager.<br>
Environment Variable:<br>
Specified as %E(variable name)  - e.g., my_prog<br>
%E(HOME)^E(LANG), my_prog/home/platinum en-us.<br>
Filename Variable:<br>
Specified as %F (filename) - B.g., my__prog %F(/etc/platinum)%C(JOB_ID) %E(HOME)my_prog /home/dmc 1234 /home/platinum where the filename /etc/platinum contains the line /home/dmc.<br>
Acceptable %C(context variable name) syntax keywords: The syntax for the variables is %C(KEYWORD) . A user may insert a space on either side of the KEYWORD inside the parentheses.  Table 3 provides a listing of sample keyword identifiers.<br><br><br>
GUI API<br>
The GUI API is utilized by the point product 100<br>
and the point product GUI 110 for a number of functions,<br>
including:<br>
•Allocate a job with the Job Scheduling API and override any default values as desired.<br><br>
•Base a GUI on class CptDynPropertySheet (which is derived from CpropertySheet} , instead of using CpropertySheet directly. CptDynPropertySheet is exported by DnyPS.DLL In addition, the GUI API may be used to submit a job without ever displaying the GUI window.<br>
•Use the GUI API to construct a CptLESJobSchedulingPage (see Fig. 25, for example) object based on the job, and then add it (arid any other pages) to the CptDynPropertySheet or CpropertySheet-derived property sheet.<br>
•Use the GUI API to customize any job parameters that are displayed on the scheduling property page.<br>
•Use the Job Scheduling API to set any required job parameters that cannot be set by controls on the scheduling property page. Examples of these include point product-specific job parameters set by calling PtLESSetJobParm.<br>
•When a final OK indicates that the job should be su&amp;mitted, use the GUI API to validate the data and submit the job.<br>
Products that use the LES Job Scheduling page as a tab call its ValidateData() method before submitting the job. ValidateData!) can be safely called multiple times and can be called in such a way that no message box appears to the user.<br>
Table 4 provides sample code for invoking the GUI<br><br><br>
Job Distribution API<br>
The job distribution API dispatches information to appropriate machines (LES workstations) , typically-called by the job data management API 140.<br>
Job Scheduling API<br>
The job scheduling API 13 0 works with the point product GUI to define submitted jobs. Some of the functions available via the job scheduling API are required, some are optional, and some are internal functions that can be set by the user through the LES GUI. A value is set for baseline functions and any desired optional functions or functions that are defined by the GUI<br><br>
targets job scheduling requirements of the products.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a common graphical user interface (Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) , for example) to schedule and list all jobs and commcn APIs used by a GUI component and the agent.<br>

product) .<br>
The following tables list functions by type and provide a brief description of each function.   The<br>
baseline functions are utilized to provide basic information for the job scheduling processes, and are listed with a description in Table 5.<br><br>
The optional functions, listed and described in Table 6, are not required and are utilized (defined) as appropriate for a specific point product.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 8 provides example code for on how the GUI API 115 would be utilized by a point product. For example, allocating a job structure requires a point product to define a handle (jh), an array defining the days the job is to run (0=don* t run, 1 = run; ie, 0,0,0,0,0,1,0 means run on Friday), a userid and password, and a call to the PtLESJobAlloc () function.<br><br><br>
Calendaring API<br>
The calendaring API is utilized internally by other APIs and provides comprehensive calendaring functions. For example, main use of the Calendaring API is to allow users to input calendaring information for a specific job run.<br><br>
Job Administration API<br>
As discussed above, the job administration API 150 deletes, cancels, reruns, or copies existing jobs.  In<br>
addition, it allows other APIs to determine job status, and setup, cancel, or update a job logfile and retrieve job parameters. For example, one process within the Job Administration API is the PtLESCancelJob utilized to stop currently running jobs. The PtLESCancelJob first performs a check, on a specified node to see if the job is running, and issues a stop command to the corresponding LES agent if the job is executing.<br>
Job Data Management API<br>
Both the job and the job history are saved in the central repository and the local repository of the node where the job is to be run. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is used to select, insert, update, and/or delete each job or job history.<br>
Point Product API<br>
The Point Product API allows the point product to communicate with the LES Agent. When you use this API, the LES job folder shows more accurate information about your job, the logfile viewer shows the job logfile, and the LES agent manages your point product job, making LES easier to use from a development standpoint.<br>
The functions of this API encapsulate PEC messages to the LES agent to update the job status or logfile, or signal the end of a running job process. The PEC model is adhered to wherein the LES agent and the point product are Rtclients using broadcast communication. PEC Initialisation has been performed before calling any of the LES_API functions.   In addition, the Point<br><br>
In one embodiment, SIGUSR2 is used as a CANCEL notification signal on all UNIX platforms, and the LES agent ignores this signal by default. Because the child process inherits all signals, the CANCEL event is ignored unless the point product takes action. As a result, conflicts may arise if a user application is using SIGUSR2 for other purposes (but allows for utiliation of standard UNIX toolsets for operations).<br>
The following Environment variables are set before running any point product by the LES Agent:<br>
LES_JOEID^"The point product current job number<br>
LES_RUN_NUM-&gt;The Point product current run number<br>
LES_GROUPID-*The point product current strategy<br>
group number<br>
LES_RUNTIME^-The schedule time (If -1, the job was<br>
scheduled to run immediately.)<br>
LES_INSTANCE-*The job instance<br>
LES_USERNAME"»The job user name<br>
LES_USERROLE-»The job user role<br>
Error messages are displayed whenever the agent detects an error. Table 9 lists the errors, consisting of a number and a message. Some of the messages use variables, which appear as % signs in the message text as shown in the following example. These variables are replaced by actual values when the error message displays. For example, in this case the variable % is replaced with the actual constraint and file name when the error message is displayed.<br><br><br><br><br>

Scheduling via POEMS<br>
The present invention has been implemented utilizing a GUI interface that includes either a window (POEMS Scheduling Service Job Scheduling Window, Figure 10) or a property page (Job Scheduling tab property-page, Figure 11) . Other embodiments or arrangements of GUI windows or pages are also applicable, for example, using pull down selection menus instead of radio buttons, as just one example).<br>
The GUI interface allows user input for scheduling specifications for a job to be submitted, including:<br>
-	Immediate job run.<br>
-	Job run at a later time.<br>
-	Starting time and date of the job.<br>
-	Recurring run intervals for the job.<br>
-	Create or select a scheduling calendar.<br>
In addition, the GUI interface allows a user define or modify a notification script.<br>
To start a job, a user enters a job description in the Job Description box, selects a run time as either immediate, a later time, or start date and time, and then Clicks on OK or Finish.<br><br>
appropriate start date and time. For example, as shown in Figure 12 a pull down calendar is provided for date selection. The pull down calendar includes advance and decrease buttons as follows:<br>
•Select the &gt;&gt; button to advance the year by one.<br>
•Select the «  button to decrease the year by one.<br>
•Select the &gt; button to advance to the next month.<br>
•Select the 
month.<br>
Since the POEMS scheduling service schedules jobs at remote nodes, a selection box is provided to use the local time of the remote node as the starting time (instead of the submitting node).<br>
Recurring job runs may be set for a wide array of intervals, including:<br>
"None - Used to schedule no recurring runs for the<br>
job.<br>
•Minutes after each hour  - Used to schedule<br>
recurring runs for a job each hour at a specified<br>
number of minutes after the hour.<br>
■Hours - Used to schedule recurring runs for a job<br>
at specified hourly intervals.<br>
•Days - Used to schedule recurring runs for a job<br>
at intervals specified in days or every weekday.<br>
•weeks - Used to schedule recurring runs for a job<br>
at intervals specified in weeks on the selected<br>
day or days.<br>
■Months - Used to schedule recurring runs for a<br>
job at intervals specified in months on the<br>
selected day or days.<br>
•Years    -    Usf=d   tn   Rrhpdnfo   TOf-m-r-irtrr   Times    fn-r-   =    in&gt;&gt;<br><br>
Figure 13 provides an example of a job scheduled to run at selected minutes after each hour (schedule the hourly recurring run interval). Figure 14 provides an example of a job scheduled to run every hour<br>
(schedule the recurring run interval in hours). Figure 15 provides an example of a job scheduled to run every day (schedule the recurring run interval in days). Figure 16 provides an example of a job scheduled to run every week on Thursday with a specific start date<br>
(schedule the recurring run interval in weeks). Figure 17 provides an example of a job scheduled to run every 25th day of the month (schedule recurring run interval in months) . Figure 18 provides an example of a j ob scheduled to run once a year on June 2 5 th<br>
(schedule the recurring run interval in years).<br>
Notification Scripts<br>
As discussed above, the GUI interface provides the user an opportunity to define, modify, or select a notification script. Notification scripts are shell scripts containing actions used to automatically provide notification about jobs and job status information. Other functions may also be performed by the notification scripts, for example. The point product application executes the jobs notification scripts. The product application documentation should include detailed information on actions taken upon job completion or job failure.<br>
Notification scripts may be constructed for tables, tablespaces, and indexes. When constructing a notification script for notification of a completed or failed job, variables of previously assigned values may<br><br>
The values for these variables are the same ones defined for a particular job in the default notification script files. A user may define the values for the variables in these files, and then use the variables in the notification script as arguments.<br>
Using these variables in a notification script allows the same script to be utilized for various jobs, since different values may be assigned to the variables for each j ob. You can use variables in a j ob completion script or job failure script as determined by the product application.<br>
Table 11 provides a listing of established notification script variables, including a description<br><br><br><br>
A Notification Scripts button on the GUI interface accesses a Notification Scripts window (see Figure 19). The Notification Scripts window allows a user to:<br>
•Modify the text to use for confirmation messages<br>
indicating the completion or failure of a job.<br>
•Write a customized script using the variables<br>
specified in this window.<br>
■Specify the path for the notification email<br>
address used to inform you of the job"s completion<br>
or failure.<br>
In each of the Job completion script box and Job failure script box, a user may enter any of the predefined script variables to modify default script, or simply type in a full path location and filename for a notification script.<br>
A full path location for a user or notification e-mail box address is typed into the Notification email address box. This method may be utilized to assign notification routing addresses for a pager, email, or phone number to deliver the information about the scheduled jobs to any location.<br><br>
Scheduling a Calendar<br>
A Calendar Selection window, see Figure 20, accessible from the GUI interface, provides a list of the predefined calendars that may be used with the current job. Using the options in this window, a user can:<br>
•Create a new calendar.<br>
•Edit an existing calendar.<br>
•Select a previously defined calendar.<br>
•Delete a calendar<br>
To create a calendar, a user selects the Create button in the Calendar selection window, which invokes the display of a Create Calendar window (see Figure 21) . The user fills out the ID (a name for the calendar) and Description fields.<br>
The user may select the following buttons to select the month and year of a date on which the job is to run:<br>
•Select the &gt;&gt; button to advance the year by one.<br>
•Select the 
•Select the &gt; button to advance to the next month.<br>
•Select the 
month.<br>
By clicking a day of the month, a red border marks the date on the calendar and the complete date displays in the Selected dates field. Multiple days may be selected.<br>
Existing calendars may also be modified by selecting a calendar first by clicking on its ID or Description in the available Calendars list in the Calendar Selection window and then clicking on the Edit button (see Fiqure 22, for example) .  Once the calendar<br><br>
selecting a date on the calendar.  A user utilizes:<br>
•Select the &gt;&gt; button to advance the year by one; •Select the  button to advance to the next month; •Select the 
then the user clicks on the day of the month. A red border marks the date on the calendar and the complete date displays in the Selected dates field. The above process is repeated until all the dates for running the job are displayed in the Selected dates field.<br>
Dates may be deleted from the Selected dates list by clicking on calendar numbers marked with red borders to deselect. The border on the date disappears when deselected and the date no longer displays in the Selected dates field.<br>
The OK button saves the calendar and exits the window. The edited calendar is then available in the Calendar Selection window. Clicking the Cancel button exits the window without saving changes to the calendar.<br>
A calendar may be selected by clicking on the Select button of the GUI interface (Job Scheduling window/property page), which displays the Calendar Selection window (Figure 20, for example). A calendar is highlighted by clicking on the calendar ID or description in the Available Calendars list, and then clicking on the Select button (or double clicking on the ID or description). The calendar selection window then closes and the selected calendar ID displays in the Calendar ID field on the Job Scheduling window or<br><br>
by clicking the Delete button instead of the Select button from the Calendar Selection window.<br>
Strategy Scheduling<br>
A Strategy Scheduling window is provided to view, create, modify, or delete schedules for a strategy. The schedule strategy window is invoked from a point product, as shown in Figure 23.<br>
A Create button is provided for creating a new schedule for a current strategy, which invokes the Job Scheduling window/property page (see Figure 24) . The Job Scheduling window/property page is then filled out for the new schedule.<br>
An Edit button is provided to modify an existing schedule for "the current strategy, which invokes the Job Scheduling window/property page available for editing a selected schedule.<br>
A delete button is provided to delete a schedule for the current strategy. A user first highlights a schedule to be deleted and then clicks on delete. A Delete Schedule window prompting for a clean up script is then displayed (see Figure 25, for example).<br>
The user may either delete the schedule without running a cleanup script by deleting the text (if any) in the Name of a shell script or other process to run to clean up associated files field, or delete the schedule and run a cleanup script by typing a path and full name of the script. The user invokes the action by clicking OK or returning to the Strategy Scheduling window without deleting by clicking Cancel.<br>
Job Management Servi ces<br><br>
use and intuitive format. The present invention utilizes a Jobs resource object to allow a Director program to identify and track various job processes.<br>
After inserting a Jobs resource object into the Director, a user may perform the following job management tasks:<br>
•View information in the following formats:<br>
•Columns - Located on the right side of the Director window.<br>
•Property pages - Located on the right side of the Director window. •Logfile - Supplied Log File Viewer •Delete jobs •Rerun jobs •Cancel job runs •Monitor the progress of job runs<br>
A Jobs resource object provides a bookmark for<br>
finding information to display, and locating a job to<br>
be acted on when utilizing job management processes<br>
(deleting or monitoring a job, for example) . An Insert<br>
Object window (see Figure 26), invoked by the user,<br>
identifies objects to insert (POEMS provides a number<br>
of objects that may be inserted, a partial listing is<br>
provided in Figure 26) .  The user selects an object<br>
(POEMS  Scheduling Service,  in this  example),  and<br>
presses  OK.    In response,  a  properties page  is<br>
displayed  (see Figure 27) ,  which includes General<br>
(Figure 28), Representation (Figure 29), Subscription,<br>
Indicators,  Job Repository  (Figure 30),  and Event<br>
Correlation tabs.<br>
The  Properties  page  includes  a  label  and<br><br>
The Representation tab allows the user to select, in an Intellicon View, an icon for representing the job, and optionally, a background and background color. Alternatively, the user may select an icon in Explorer view.<br>
The Intellicon view is show in Figure 29, and includes a list of Intellicon icons (provided by POEMS files, or alternatively provided by the user), and a display window to view a selected icon (graphic) . An example of the Explorer view is illustrated in Figure 30, which is an Explorer view displaying Provision (point product, or application) Jobs (or LES jobs) as the label for a Jobs resource object.<br>
Selecting the Job repository tab displays a window for defining a timezone for display of times related to jobs. A down arrow pull down menu bar provides the user with selections of any timezone. This selection does not affect the time or timezone selected for running a job as specified in the Job Scheduling property page. In one embodiment, daylight savings time may be compensated for by providing an automatic compensation selector that invokes a program to adjust for daylight savings time; alternatively, the user may select a timezone just east of the desired timezone.<br>
Using Job Resource Objects<br>
The Job Resource objects defined by the above processes enables a user to locate and view both jobs and runs. The user can locate each job in the Explorer view. Each time a job executes, it creates a new run, which then displays in a run folder for the job.<br>
Each Jobs resource object contains a hierarchy of<br><br>
•All Jobs - Lists all jobs regardless of current<br>
status and also lists all runs by status.<br>
•Jobs By Group - Lists all jobs arranged by group<br>
Ids.<br>
•Jobs By Node - Lists all j obs arranged by the<br>
node on which the job runs.<br>
•Jobs By Product - Lists all jobs arranged by the<br>
product used for the job.<br>
•Jobs By Type - Lists all jobs arranged by type.<br>
•Jobs By User - Lists all jobs arranged by the<br>
user who scheduled the job.<br>
owever, a point product may not allow a user to assign j ob group or type.   The hierarchy of folders is llustrated in Figure 32.<br>
The All Jobs Folder (see Figure 33) numerically ists all of the jobs instead of categorizing them by roup, product or type. The All Jobs Folder lists jobs n folders, including:<br>
•All Jobs Any Status - Lists all jobs regardless of status along with associated job history (each run of the job).<br>
•All Runs By Status - Arranges all of the runs of jobs into the following folders according to their current status:<br>
•Completed Runs •Failed Runs •Not Started Runs •Preempted Runs •Running Runs •Stopped Runs •Held Jobs - Lists all of the jobs that are held<br><br>
•Scheduled Jobs - Lists all of the jobs that are scheduled to run.<br>
A user can display jobs according to the groups assigned to them when they were originally scheduled by using the Jobs Group Folder. The specific product application (used to run the job} assigns a group, but may not use this classification.<br>
Jobs may be displayed according to the node on which they ran by using the Jobs By Node Folder.<br>
Jobs may be displayed according to the specific product that ran each job by using the Jobs By Product Folder. This is helpful if using multiple Provision products to schedule and run jobs with the POEMS Scheduling Service (helpful because it allows grouping of jobs by function or application, for example).<br>
Jobs may be displayed by job type assigned to them when the jobs were originally scheduled by using the Jobs by Type Folder. The user"s specific product application (used to run the job) assigns the job type. However, products do not necessarily use this classification.<br>
Jobs may be displayed according to the user who scheduled the job by using the Jobs By User Folder. Each of the Jobs By User, Jobs By Type, Jobs By Product, Jobs By Node and Jobs By Group Folders contain the same folder hierarchy for each user as that for the All Jobs Folder described above.<br>
Specific jobs may be located by expanding folders using the ( + ) signs in the Jobs resource object hierarchy. The resulting display includes Job ID, Job Icon, and a Job description.<br><br>
The run history is stored in several folders. The All Runs folder contains every run regardless of its status. The remaining six folders contain only the runs that possess the status that applies to that folder {Completed, Failed, Not Started, Preempted, Running and Stopped Runs).<br>
Specific runs may be located in the All Runs folder and according to its status as illustrated in Figure 34. In Figure 34, Run til of Job 883 is stopped; therefore, it displays in the Stopped Runs folder as well as in the All Runs folder.<br>
Each run listing includes:<br>
■Run icon<br>
•Run number<br>
•Run start date and time<br>
Data can be viewed in column format for all jobs, runs, groups, nodes, products, types and users stored in a job, runs, groups, nodes, products, or types folder. The data displays in columns on the right side of the Director window when using the Explorer view. As shown in Figure 36, some of the data is shown that is available for the jobs in the All Jobs Any Status folder under a specific node in the Jobs By Node folder.<br>
A user can select any of the following folders to view data for their contents in column format (note that some folders, such as All Jobs, do not provide data), including:<br>
•Jobs By Group<br>
•Jobs By Node<br>
•Jobs By Product<br>

A running total of submitted, succeeded, pending, and failed deletions displays in the small Submitted, Succeeded, Pending, and Failed fields.<br>
Rerunning Jobs<br>
The Jobs Administrator window may be utilised to rerun completed jobs using the same parameters. Either multiple jobs or single jobs may be rerun. When a job is rerun, a new run number is assigned. In one embodiment, locked jobs are prevented from being rerun via these procedures.<br><br>
Rerunning Multiple Jobs<br>
To rerun multiple jobs, the Jobs Administrator window is accessed at the level of the folder containing the jobs to rerun in a Jobs resource object. The folder containing the jobs to rerun is located, and a right-click on the icon or text of the folder displays a popup menu (see Figure 54} . Selecting Rerun from the popup menu displays the Rerun Jobs window (see Figure 55) . This window displays the Job ID and node name of all of the jobs selected in the Submit Jobs/Runs field and provides options for rerunning them.<br>
Similar to the Delete Jobs procedures discussed above, all of the jobs in a folder are initially selected. If the user clicks on a job, it is deselected and will not be rerun. If the user deselects all of the jobs, the Submit button becomes inactive.<br>
A user may utilize one of the following options in the Start Date &amp; Time specification area by:<br>
•Clicking on the Run Immediately button to rerun<br>
the jobs immediately;<br>
Or •Clicking on the Schedule later button to cancel the previously scheduled next starting time for the j obs and hold the j obs in the Held Jobs folder.<br>
Note: Jobs may be rerun either immediately or at a specified time using the Job Administrator window (see Rerunning Multiple<br><br>
Or •Clicking on the Run at button and type the date in the Job Start Date field, or clicking on the down arrow to select the date from a calendar, then typing the nime in the Job Start Time field, or using the up/down arrows to scroll to the desired time.<br>
Note: In one embodiment the user must set the date and time in these fields using the time zone originally used to run the jobs. The job times in the Jobs resource object may not display in the Lime zone where the job originally ran.<br>
The selected jobs are then rerun at the specified<br>
date and time.  Clicking on the Submit button reruns<br>
the selected jobs, and the window expands to provide a<br>
dynamic display of the status and results of the action<br>
(see Figure 56).<br>
The selected jobs are then rerun at the specified date and time. Clicking on the Submit button reruns the selected jobs, and the window expands to provide a dynamic display of the status and results of the action {see Figure 56). If a job is submitted successfully, the job ID and node name for each job display in the Succeeded field. If a job fails to submit, the job ID, node name, and an error code for that job display in the Failed field.<br>
A running total of submitted, succeeded, pending, and failed reruns displays in the Submitted, Succeeded, Pending, and Failed fields.<br><br>
Rerunning Single Jobs<br>
To rerun single jobs, the Jobs Administrator window is accessed at the level of the job to rerun. After locating the job to rerun in the Jobs folder, the icon or text of the job is right-clicked to display a menu (see Figure 57) , and Rerun is selected, displaying the Rerun Jobs window (see Figure 58). This window displays the Job ID and node name of the selected job and provides options fcr rerunning it. Clicking the job deselects it and the Submit button becomes inactive. Similar start date &amp; time options, as discussed above, are also available. Clicking on the Submit button reruns the job.<br>
As with the other rerun options, the window expands to provide a dynamic display of the status and results of the submission.<br>
Canceling Runs<br>
The user can use the Jobs Administrator to cancel a running job. The user can cancel multiple runs or single runs of a jab. However, some products may temporarily disable this capability during a critical stage of a job, which does not allow recovery, makes recovery difficult, or requires that the product specific procedures be followed for recovery.<br>
Canceling Multiple Runs<br>
To cancel multiple runs, the Jobs Administrator is accessed at the level of the folder containing the runs to cancel in a Jobs resource object. After locating a Running Runs folder containing the runs to cancel, a right-click on the icon or text of the folder displays<br><br>
Runs window is displayed (see Figure 60). This window displays the Job ID, run number, and node name of all of the runs selected in the Submit Jobs/Runs field (see Fig.  57, for example) .<br>
Similar to the Delete Job procedures, all of the runs in a folder are selected initially. By clicking on a run, it is deselected and will not be canceled. If all of the runs are deselected, the Submit button becomes inactive, etc. The Submit button cancels the selected runs, and the window expands to provide a dynamic display of the status and results of the action.<br>
Monitoring the Progress of Jobs<br>
A Progress Monitor is provided to view information about a current phase and overall progress of any job run by products using the POEMS Scheduling Service.<br>
Individual products publish events regarding the different phases of their jobs. The Progress Monitor subscribes to these events and uses the resulting data to provide the user with information on the progress of the j ob.<br>
The specific progress identifiers and the job phases that may be monitored are dependent on the individual design of the product using the POEMS Scheduling Service.<br>
Accessing the Progress Monitor<br>
The Progress Monitor may be accessed at the individual run level in the Jobs Repository Resource Obj ect.<br>
To monitor the progress of a job, a user first<br><br>
Progress Monitor from the popup menu displays the Progress Monitor {see Figure 62) . The Progress Monitor is configured to display the following information:<br>
•Name of the current: phase of the job.<br>
•job ID and run number.<br>
•Name and/or number of the current phase of the<br>
job-<br>
•Current phase number and the time remaining in<br>
the current phase.<br>
•Graphical display of the progress of the current<br>
phase of the job and the percentage completed of<br>
the current phase.<br>
•Graphical display of the overall progress of the<br>
job (including all phases)  and the percentage<br>
completed for the entire job.<br>
In one embodiment, the contents of the main text field vary according to the design of the product that scheduled the job.<br>
The name of the current phase of the job can be viewed from the title bar of the Progress Monitor window. The progress of the job"s current phase is determined by viewing the main text field in the Progress Monitor window, or viewing the Current Phase Progress field in the Progress Monitor window. Black bars are used to graphically display the phase progress. This field also provides the percentage completed of the job"s current phase.<br>
The progress for the entire job is viewed using the Overall Progress field in the Progress Monitor window. Again, black bars are used to graphically display the overall job"s progress, and the percentage<br><br>
Troubleshooting Tips<br>
The  present  invention  includes  a  number  of<br>
troubleshooting techniques.  A number of possibilities<br>
may cause a failure to delete and rerun jobs, or cancel<br>
specific runs of a job.<br>
If a submission fails:<br>
•Communications  to  the  local  and  central<br>
repositories may not be working.  Verify that you<br>
can communicate with both of the repositories, and<br>
then submit the request again.<br>
•The user may have attempted to cancel a run<br>
during a critical phase of job execution.  The<br>
specific Provision product being used may prevent<br>
the user from using the cancel feature to avoid a<br>
potential conflict.<br>
•The POEMS Scheduling Service agent (ptlesag.exe)<br>
may not be running on the node/machine where the<br>
object is located.   Verify that a scheduling<br>
service agent is running on that machine, and then<br>
submit the request again.<br>
To verify that a Scheduling Services agent is running on a node, a user selects Tools ► Monitor ► Service Managers from the menu bar to display the Director Service Manager Monitor window (see Figure 63) . The user may click on the plus sign ( + ) or double-click on the text of Service Managers to display the list of service managers on different nodes. Clicking on the text of the service manager for a node brings up the right side of the Service Manager Monitor with information for the programs residing on that node (see Figure 64) .<br><br>
