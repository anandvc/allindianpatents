Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 7-a-aminoacyl-cephalosporin derivatives having the general formula (I). More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cefprozil of the formula (I), its esters, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or<br><br>
wherein R represents hydrogen, ester which form a prodrug or a counter ion, which forms a salt.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cefprozil is chemically known as (6R,7R)-7-[2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-[(Z)-propenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. It is an orally effective cephalosporin antibiotic having a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram-negative organisms and is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,520,022.<br>
US patent No. 4,694,079 discloses a process for the preparation of DMF solvate of cefprozil as shown in scheme 1 below:<br><br><br>
US patent No. 5,608,055 discloses a process for the production of 7-a-aminoacyl-cephalosporin by acylating 7-amino-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof in a halogen-free and water-immisble or sparingly soluble solvent in water selected from ketones, esters, aromatic hydrocarbon, alkanols.<br>
US patent Nos. 6,136,967 and 5,869,648 discloses a process for the preparation of cefprozil comprising :<br>
i) preparing a (Z)-isomer enriched 7-amino-3-(l-propen-l-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in free acid or salt form by depleting 7-amino-3-{(E)-l-propen-l-yl}-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in a mixture of 7-amino-3-{(Z)-l-propen-l-yl}-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid and 7-amino-3-{(E)-l-propen-l-yl}-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid by subjecting a solution of a mixture of (Z)- and (E)-isomers to adsorption chromatography, and, if desired, isolating a (Z)-isomer enriched 7-amino-3-(l-propen-l-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in free acid or salt form; and<br><br>
ii) acylating the (Z)-isomer enriched 7-amino-3-(l-propen-l-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in free acid or salt form obtained in step (i) at the amine group in position 7 of the ring system to obtain cefprozil.<br>
None of the prior art processes teaches the usage of ether solvents for the silylation of APCA and condensation steps. Hence we focused our research with these solvents and found a simple process for the preparation of cefprozil.<br>
