				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to novel, pharmaceutically active, heterocyclic<br>
compounds, more particularly imidazole compounds, and methods of using<br>
them to treat or prevent disorders and conditions mediated by the histamine H4<br>
receptor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Histamine was first identified as a hormone (Barger, G. and H.H. Dale,<br>
J. Physiol. (London) 1910, 41:19-59) and has since been demonstrated to play<br>
a major role in a variety of physiological processes, including the inflammatory<br>
"triple response" via H1 receptors (Ash, A.S.F. and H.O. Schild, Br. J. Pharmac.<br>
Chemother. 1966, 27:427-439), gastric acid secretion via H2 receptors (Black,<br>
J.W. et al., Nature 1972, 236:385-390), and neurotransmitter release in the<br>
central nervous system via H3 receptors (Arrang, J.-M. et al., Nature 1983,<br>
302:832-837) (for review see Hill, S.J. et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 1997,<br>
49(3):253-278). All three histamine receptor subtypes have been<br>
demonstrated to be members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors<br>
(Gantz. I. e tal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991, 88:429-433; Lovenberg,<br>
T.W. et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 1999, 55(6):1101-1107; Yamashita, M. et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991, 88:11515-11519). There are, however,<br>
additional functions of histamine that have been reported, for which no receptor<br>
has been identified. For example, in 1994, Raible et al. demonstrated that<br>
histamine and R-a- methylhistamine could activate calcium mobilization in<br>
human eosinophils (Raible, D.G. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994,<br>
149:1506-1511). These responses were blocked by the H3-receptor<br>
antagonist thioperamide. However, R-α-methylhistamine was significantly less<br><br>
potent than histamine, which was not consistent with the involvement of known<br>
H3 receptor subtypes. Therefore, Raible et al. hypothesized the existence of a<br>
novel histamine receptor on eosinophils that was non-H1, non-H2, and non-H3.<br>
Most recently several groups (Oda, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000,<br>
275(47):36781-36786; Liu, C. et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 2001, 59(3):420-426;<br>
Nguyen, T. et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 2001, 59(3):427-433; Zhu, Y. et al., Mol.<br>
Pharmacol. 2001, 59(3):434-441; Morse, K.L. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.<br>
2001, 296(3):1058-1066) have identified and characterized a fourth histamine<br>
receptor subtype, the H4 receptor. This receptor is a 390 amino acid, seven-<br>
transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor with approximately 40% homology<br>
to the histamine H3 receptor. In contrast to the H3 receptor, which is primarily<br>
located in the brain, the H4 receptor is expressed at greater levels in<br>
eosinophils and mast cells, among other cells, as reported by Liu et al. (infra)<br>
and Hofstra et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305(3): 1212-1221).<br>
Because of its preferential expression on immunocompetent cells, this H4<br>
receptor is closely related with the regulatory functions of histamine during the<br>
immune response.<br>
A biological activity of histamine in the context of immunology and<br>
autoimmune diseases is closely related with the allergic response and its<br>
deleterious effects, such as inflammation. Events that elicit the inflammatory<br>
response include physical stimulation (including trauma), chemical stimulation,<br>
infection, and invasion by a foreign body. The inflammatory response is<br>
characterized by pain, increased temperature, redness, swelling, reduced<br>
function, or a combination of these.<br>
Mast-cell de-granulation (exocytosis) releases histamine and leads to an<br>
inflammatory response that may be initially characterized by a histamine-<br>
modulated wheal and flare reaction. A wide variety of immunological stimuli<br>
(e.g., allergens or antibodies) and non-immunological (e.g., chemical) stimuli<br>
may cause the activation, recruitment, and de-granulation of mast cells. Mast-<br>
cell activation initiates allergic (H1) inflammatory responses, which in turn<br>
cause the recruitment of other effector cells that further contribute to the<br>
inflammatory response. The histamine H2 receptors modulate gastric acid<br><br>
secretion, and the histamine H3 receptors affect neurotransmitter release in the<br>
central nervous system.<br>
Modulation of H4 receptors controls the release of inflammatory<br>
mediators and inhibits leukocyte recruitment, thus providing the ability to<br>
prevent and/or treat H4-mediated diseases and conditions, including the<br>
deleterious effects of allergic responses such as inflammation. Compounds<br>
according to the present invention have H4 receptor modulating properties.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention have leukocyte recruitment<br>
inhibiting properties. Compounds according to the present invention have anti-<br>
inflammatory properties.<br>

and R. Snyderman, Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates, 3rd<br>
Edition, (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, 1999); V. Stvrtinova, V. et<br>
al., "Inflammation and Fever", Pathophysiology Principles of Diseases<br>

Of Medicine, 18th Edition (W.B. Saunders Company, 1988); and Steadmans<br>

Inflammation herein refers to the response that develops as a<br>
consequence of histamine release, which in turn is caused by at least one<br>
stimulus. Examples of such stimuli are immunological stimuli and non-<br>
immunological stimuli.<br>
Inflammation is due to any one of a plurality of conditions such as<br>
allergy, asthma, chronic obstructed pulmonary disease (COPD),<br>
atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel<br>
diseases (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, allergic<br>
rhinitis, scleroderma, autoimmune thyroid diseases, immune-mediated (also<br><br>
known as type 1) diabetes mellitus and lupus, which are characterized by<br>
excessive or prolonged inflammation at some stage of the disease. Other<br>
autoimmune diseases that lead to inflammation include Myasthenia gravis,<br>
autoimmune neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barre, autoimmune uveitis,<br>
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia, autoimmune<br>
thrombocytopenia, temporal arteritis, anti-phospholipid syndrome, vasculitides,<br>
such as Wegener's granulomatosis, Behcet's disease, dermatitis herpetiformis,<br>
pemphigus vulgaris, vitiligio, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis,<br>
autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, autoimmune disease of the adrenal gland,<br>
polymyositis, dermatomyositis, spondyloarthropathies, such as ankylosing<br>
spondylitis, and Sjogren's syndrome. Regarding the onset and evolution of<br>
inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammation-mediated diseases or<br>
conditions include, but are not limited to, acute inflammation, allergic<br>
inflammation, and chronic inflammation.<br>

Embodiments of compounds of formulae (I) and (II) are modulators of<br>
the H4 receptor. Embodiments of this invention comprise mixtures of<br>
compounds of formulae (I) and (II).<br>
Isomeric forms of the compounds of formulae (I) and (II), and of their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, amides and esters, are encompassed within<br>
the present invention, and reference herein to one of such isomeric forms is<br>
meant to refer to at least one of such isomeric forms. One of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will recognize that compounds according to this invention may exist, for<br><br>
example, in a single isomeric form whereas other compounds may exist in the<br>
form of a regioisomeric mixture.<br>
Whether stated explicitly or not in any part of the written description and<br>
claims, it is understood that each substituent and member assignment in the<br>
context of this invention is made independently of any other member and<br>
substituent assignment, unless stated otherwise. By way of a first example on<br>
substituent terminology, if substituent S1example is one of S1 and S2, and<br>
substituent S2example is one of S3 and S4, then these assignments refer to<br>
embodiments of this invention given according to the choices S1example is S1 and<br>
S2 example is S3, S1 example is S1 and S2 example is S4; S1 example is S2 and S2 example is S3;<br>
S1example is S2 and S2example is S4; and equivalents of each one of such choices.<br>
The shorter terminology "S1example is one of S1 and S2, and S2example is one of S3<br>
and S4" is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of<br>
limitation. The foregoing first example on substituent terminology, which is<br>
stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent R<br>
assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for<br>
substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as X, Y, Z, and W,<br>
and the index n.<br>
Furthermore, when more than one assignment is given for any member<br>
or substituent, embodiments of this invention comprise the various groupings<br>
that can be made from the listed assignments, taken independently, and<br>
equivalents thereof. By way of a second example on substituent terminology, if<br>
it is herein described that substituent Sexample is one of S1, S2, and S3, this<br>
listing refers to embodiments of this invention for which Sexample is S1; Sexample is<br>
S2; Sexample is S3; Sexample is one of S1 and S2; Sexample is one of S1 and S3;<br>
Sexample is one of S2 and S3; Sexample is one of S1, S2 and S3; and Sexample is any<br>
equivalent of each one of these choices. The shorter terminology "Sexample is<br>
one of S1, S2, and S3" is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not<br>
by way of limitation. The foregoing second example on substituent<br>
terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various<br>
substituent R assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given<br>
herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as X, Y, Z,<br>
and W, and the index n.<br><br>
The nomenclature "CH" with j &gt; i, when applied herein to a class of<br>
substituents, is meant to refer to embodiments of this invention for which each<br>
and every one of the number of carbon members, from i to j including i and j, is<br>
independently realized. By way of example, the term C1-3 refers independently<br>
to embodiments that have one carbon member (C1), embodiments that have<br>
two carbon members (C2), and embodiments that have three carbon members<br>
(C3).<br>
The term Cn-malkyl refers to an aliphatic chain, whether straight or<br>
branched, with a total number N of carbon members in the chain that satisfies<br>
n ≤ N ≤ m, with m &gt; n.<br>
When any variable referring to a substituent, compound member or<br>
index, occurs more than once, the full range of assignments is meant to apply<br>
to each occurrence, independently of the specific assignment(s) to any other<br>
occurrence of such variable. For each occurrence of a variable, it is<br>
understood that such an assignment is made independently from other<br>
member and substituent assignments.<br>
According to the foregoing interpretive considerations on assignments<br>
and nomenclature, it is understood that explicit reference herein to a set<br>
implies, where chemically meaningful and unless indicated otherwise,<br>
independent reference to embodiments of such set, and reference to each and<br>
every one of the possible embodiments of subsets of the set referred to<br>
explicitly.<br>
Any disubstituent referred to herein is meant to encompass the various<br>
attachment possibilities when more than one of such possibilities are allowed.<br>
For example, reference to disubstituent -A-B-, where A ≠ B, refers herein to<br>
such disubstituent with A attached to a first substituted member and B attached<br>
to a second substituted member, and it also refers to such disubstituent with A<br>
attached to the second substituted member and B attached to the first<br>
substituted member.<br>
The present invention also features methods for inhibiting H4 receptor<br>
activity with such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such<br>
compounds, and methods of using such compositions in the treatment or<br><br>
prevention of conditions that are mediated by the H4 receptor, such as<br>
inflammation. Compounds according to the present invention and derivatives<br>
thereof can also be used as reference compounds in assays to assess H4<br>
receptor modulating characteristics in light of one or more factors such as<br>
receptor inhibition, toxicity, bioavailability, and protein binding capability.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention include<br>
at least one of the compounds of the present invention. If more than one of<br>
such compounds is included in a composition, the therapeutically effective<br>
amount may be a jointly effective amount. As such inhibitors of H4 receptor<br>
activity, compounds and compositions according to the present invention are<br>
useful in the prevention, inhibition, or treatment of H4 receptor-mediated<br>
conditions, such as inflammation.<br>
The invention also features a pharmaceutical composition for treating or<br>
preventing an H4 receptor-mediated condition in a subject, comprising a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of at least one H4 receptor modulator selected<br>
from compounds of formulae (I) and (II), enantiomers, diastereomers,<br>
racemates, tautomers, hydrates, solvates thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>

cyano, nitro, -C(O)NRaRb, -C(O)phenyl, -C(O)C1-6alkyl, -S(O)C1-4alkyl, and<br>
-SO2C1-4alkyl.<br>
As in standard chemical nomenclature, the group phenyl is herein<br>
referred to as "phenyl" or as "Ph".<br>
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative<br>
expressions given herein are not qualified with the term "about". It is<br>
understood that whether the term "about" is used explicitly or not, every<br>
quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also<br>
meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably<br><br>
be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including equivalents and<br>
approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for<br>
such given value. Whenever a yield is given as a percentage, such yield refers<br>
to a mass of the entity for which the yield is given with respect to the maximum<br>
mass of the same entity that could be obtained under the particular<br>
stoichiometric conditions. Concentrations that are given as percentages refer<br>
to mass ratios, unless indicated differently.<br>
It is understood that substitutions and combinations of substitutions<br>
recited herein, whether stated explicitly or not, refer to substitutions that are<br>
consistent with the valency of the member being substituted. Terms such as<br>
"valence allowed site," "valence allowed member," and morphological<br>
variations thereof are used in this sense. For example, "valence allowed" when<br>
applied to a carbon member refers to the tetravalency of C; it refers to the<br>
trivalency of N when applied to a nitrogen member; and it refers to the bonding<br>
of a nitrogen member that is conventionally characterized with a positive<br>
electric charge or that is in a quaternary form. The present invention also<br>
encompasses compounds as described herein and equivalents thereof with at<br>
least one valence allowed nitrogen member, including but not limited to a<br>
quaternary nitrogen member and a nitrogen oxide, each of which may be<br>
prepared according to known methods (See, J. March, Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 4th ed., 1991, pp. 411-412, 1200-1201; R.C. Larock,<br>
Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 1989, pp. 397-400, 421-425; and<br>
references cited therein).<br>
Particular preferred compounds of the invention comprise an imidazole<br>
compound of formula (I) or (II), or an enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate,<br>
tautomer, hydrate, solvate thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
amide or ester thereof, wherein R1-12, X, Y, Z, W, and n have any of the<br>
meanings defined hereinabove and equivalents thereof, or at least one of the<br>
following assignments and equivalents thereof. Such assignments may be<br>
used where appropriate with any of the definitions, claims or embodiments<br>
defined herein:<br>

c)	trifluoromethyl;<br>
R6 and R7 are, independently, -H or methyl;<br>
R8 is-H, methyl, or ethyl;<br>
R8 is methyl; and<br>
R9 is -H, -F, -CI, or methyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) or (II) comprise compounds that satisfy any<br>
one of the combinations of definitions given herein and equivalents thereof.<br>
It is understood that some compounds referred to herein are chiral<br>
and/or have geometric isomeric centers, for example E- and Z- isomers. The<br>
present invention encompasses all such optical isomers, including<br>
diastereoisomers and racemic mixtures, and geometric isomers that possess<br>
the activity that characterizes the compounds of this invention. In addition,<br>
certain compounds referred to herein can exist in solvated as well as<br>
unsolvated forms. It is understood that this invention encompasses all such<br>
solvated and unsolvated forms that possess the activity that characterizes the<br>
compounds of this invention. Compounds according to the present invention<br>
that have been modified to be detectable by some analytic technique are also<br>
within the scope of this invention. An example of such compounds is an<br>
isotopically labeled compound, such as an 18F isotopically labeled compound<br><br>
that may be used as a probe in detection and/or imaging techniques, such as<br>
positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed<br>
tomography (SPECT). Another example of such compounds is an isotopically<br>
labeled compound, such as a deuterium and/or tritium labeled compound that<br>
may be used in reaction kinetic studies.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of the compounds that are readily convertible in vivo into the<br>
required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present<br>
invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the<br>
various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a<br>
compound that may not be specifically disclosed, but that converts to the<br>
specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional<br>
procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are<br>
described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier,<br>
1985.<br>
Reference to a compound herein stands for a reference to any one of:<br>
(a) the actually recited form of such compound, and (b) any of the forms of<br>
such compound in the medium in which the compound is being considered<br>
when named. For example, reference herein to a compound such as R-<br>
COOH, encompasses reference to any one of, for example, R-COOH(S), R-<br>
COOH(SOl), and R-COO-(SOl). In this example, R-COOH(S) refers to the solid<br>
compound, as it could be for example in a tablet or some other solid<br>
pharmaceutical composition or preparation; R-COOH(SOl) refers to the<br>
undissociated form of the compound in a solvent, such as water; and R-COO-<br>
(SOl) refers to the dissociated form of the compound in a solvent, such as the<br>
dissociated form of the compound in an aqueous environment, whether such<br>
dissociated form derives from R-COOH, from a salt thereof, or from any other<br>
entity that yields R-COO- upon dissociation in the medium being considered.<br>
In another example, an expression such as "exposing an entity to compound of<br>
formula R-COOH" refers to the exposure of such entity to the form, or forms, of<br>
the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such<br>
exposure takes place. In this regard, if such entity is for example in an<br><br>
aqueous environment, it is understood that the compound R-COOH is in such<br>
same medium, and therefore the entity is being exposed to species such as R-<br>
COOH(aq) and/or R-COO-(aq), where the subscript "(aq)" stands for "aqueous"<br>
according to its conventional meaning in chemistry and biochemistry. A<br>
carboxylic acid functional group has been chosen in these nomenclature<br>
examples; this choice is not intended, however, as a limitation but it is merely<br>
an illustration. It is understood that analogous examples can be provided in<br>
terms of other functional groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl, basic<br>
nitrogen members, such as those in amines, and any other group that interacts<br>
or transforms according to known manners in the medium that contains the<br>
compound. Such interactions and transformations include, but are not limited<br>
to, dissociation, association, tautomerism, solvolysis, including hydrolysis,<br>
solvation, including hydration, protonation, and deprotonation. No further<br>
examples in this regard are provided herein because these interactions and<br>
transformations in a given medium are known by any one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art.<br>

Compounds according to the present invention may be made according<br>
tc processes within the skill of the art and/or according to processes of this<br><br>
invention, such as those described in the schemes and examples that follow<br>
and by matrix or combinatorial methods. To obtain the various compounds<br>
herein, starting materials may be employed that carry the ultimately desired<br>
substituents though the reaction scheme with or without protection as<br>
appropriate. Starting materials may be obtained from commercial sources or<br>
synthesized by methods known to one skilled in the art. Alternatively, it may be<br>
necessary to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a<br>
suitable group, which may be carried through the reaction scheme and<br>
replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. Those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will be able to modify and adapt the guidance provided herein to make<br>
compounds according to the present invention.<br>
Embodiments of processes illustrated herein include, when chemically<br>
meaningful, one or more steps such as hydrolysis, halogenation, protection,<br>
and deprotection. These steps can be implemented in light of the teachings<br>
provided herein and the ordinary skill in the art.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. In addition, compounds of<br>
this invention may be modified by using protecting groups; such compounds,<br>
precursors, or prodrugs are also within the scope of the invention. This<br>
modification may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups,<br>
such as those described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", ed.<br>
J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts,<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage<br>
using methods known from the art.<br><br><br><br>
Referring to Schemes 1 and 2, there are disclosed the following notes<br>
and additions. The starting materials for the steps described below regarding<br><br>
Schemes 1 and 2 are commercially available or easily accessible to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) or (II) are prepared by condensing a suitably<br>
substituted 1,2-diketone (III) with a suitably substituted aldehyde (IV') or (IV") in<br>
the presence of a source of ammonia (NH3) to form a compound of formula (I)<br>
when the aldehyde (IV') has a para ether substitution with respect to the<br>
aldehyde group (Scheme 1), or a compound of formula (II) when the aldehyde<br>
(IV") has a meta ether substitution with respect to the aldehyde group (Scheme<br>
2). Suitable sources of ammonia include liquid and gaseous ammonia,<br>
aqueous ammonia, ammonia in methyl or ethyl alcohol, ammonia in 1,4-<br>
dioxane, NH4OAc, NH4CI, NH4HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, ammonium benzoate, and<br>
other chemically compatible sources of ammonia or ammonium salts, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
This condensation is preferably performed in a heated medium in a<br>
chemically compatible solvent. Reaction medium temperatures range<br>
preferably from about room temperature to about 110 °C, more preferably from<br>
about 50 °C to about 80 °C. Solvents that can be used for this reaction include<br>
ethanol, isopropanol, acetic acid, water, THF, dioxane, DMF, DMA, and<br>
DMSO, preferably methanol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl aldehydes (IV') and (IV") can be<br>
prepared according to procedures known in the art. In one preparation<br>
procedure, a suitably substituted hydroxy benzaldehyde is reacted with a<br>
suitably substituted moiety to form the ether link in compounds (IV') and (IV").<br>
Reaction with a suitably substituted 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde leads to the<br>
formation of compound (IV'), and reaction with a suitably substituted 3-hydroxy<br>
benzaldehyde leads to the formation of compound (IV").<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to<br>
the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as resolution, for example by<br>
formation of diastereomeric salts, kinetic resolution including variants thereof,<br>
such as dynamic resolution, preferential crystallization, biotransformation,<br>
enzymatic transformation, and preparative chromatography. The compounds<br>
may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared<br><br>
either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for<br>
example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard<br>
techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with<br>
an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-<br>
toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of<br>
the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of<br>
diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and<br>
removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be separated<br>
using a chiral HPLC column. Regioisomeric mixtures may also be separated<br>
into their constituent regioisomers by conventional techniques.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
those that are pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases<br>
that are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in<br>
the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All<br>
salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, and amides of compounds<br>
according to the present invention refer to those salts, amides and ester forms<br>
of the compounds of the present invention that would be apparent to the<br>
pharmaceutical chemist, i.e., those that are non-toxic and that would favorably<br>
affect the pharmacological properties of said compounds of the present<br>
invention. Those compounds having favorable pharmacological properties<br>
would be apparent to the pharmaceutical chemist, i.e., those that are non-toxic<br>
and that possess such pharmacological properties to provide sufficient<br>
palatability, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Other factors,<br>
more practical in nature, that are also important in the selection are cost of raw<br>
materials, ease of crystallization, yield, stability, hygroscopicity, and flowability<br>
of the resulting bulk drug.<br>

forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate<br>
base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts; the alkali and<br>
