				<td>PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITION CONTAINING HYDROPHOBICALLY<br>
MODIFIED POLYMERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a cosmetically acceptable composition containing a polyacrylamide composed of acrylamide, one or more cationic monomer and optionally one or more anionic monomers where the polyacrylamide is modified by incorporation of hydrophobic groups and a method of using the composition for treating hair, skin and nails.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Over the last twenty years, the personal care industry has expanded into the realm of hydrophobically modified polymers, mostly in the area of thickening. Such ingredients include modified hydroxethyl cellulose and acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate.<br>
The rationale for making new polymers containing various alkyl groups is to introduce properties that may not be achieved through unmodified acrylate or acrylamide polymers alone. Despite the continual introduction of new polymeric products, the monomeric quaternaries, fatty amines and fatty alcohols and emollients continue to play a very important role in personal care products. Many products contain at least a small amount of these materials. However, these conditioning agents may build up on substrates such as hair over time, thereby decreasing the hair's volume. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for new products having properties which cannot be achieved by conventional polymers and which do not have the disadvantages associated with currently used monomeric materials.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is a cosmetically acceptable composition comprising one or more hydrophobically modified polyacrylamides wherein the polyacrylamide is<br><br>
composed acrylamide and one or more cationic monomers and optionally one or more anionic monomers.<br>
The hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide enhances properties such as creaminess, slip, feel, viscosity and moisturization depending on the type of hydrophobia moiety incorporated into the polymer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
"Anionic monomer" means a monomer as defined herein which possesses a net negative charge above a certain pH value. Representative anionic monomers include base addition salts of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, sulfopropyl acrylate or methacrylate or other water-soluble forms of these or other polymerizable carboxylic or sulfonic acids, sulphomethylated acrylamide, allyl sulphonate, styrene sulfonic acid, sodium vinyl sulphonate, and the like. Preferred anionic monomers are acrylic acid and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-l -propanesulfonic acid.<br>
"Base addition salt" means the salt resulting from reaction of a carboxylic acid (-CO2H) group with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a metal cation or tetraalkylammonium cation, or with ammonia, or an organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine of sufficient basicity to form a salt with the carboxylic acid group. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, and the like. Preferred base addition salts include the sodium and ammonium salts.<br>
"Cationic monomer" means a vinylic monomer suitable for co-polymerization with acrylamide under free radical forming conditions and capable of maintaining a net positive charge after the transamidation reaction as described herein. Representative cationic monomers include, but are not limited to monomers having the following formulas.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1-R13 are independently selected from H, -CH3 and -CH2CH3 and n is 2 or 3.<br>
"IV" stands for intrinsic viscosity, which is RSV extrapolated to the limit of infinite dilution, infinite dilution being when the concentration of polymer is equal to zero.<br>
"Hydrophobia alkyl group" means an alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl group of about 4 to about 22 carbon atoms. Alkyl and alkenyl groups may be straight or branched and may be interrupted with one or more -OSKROCR.")- and -Si(R')(R")- groups wherein R' and R" are C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
"Hydrophobic amine" means a compound containing at least one hydrophobic alkyl group and at least one amino hydrogen atom capable of undergoing a transamidation reaction with an amido (-C(O)NH2) group of a polyacrylamide as defined herein to form a hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide. Hydrophobic<br>
amines containing -OSi(R')(R")- and -Si(R')(R"}- groups are also referred to as "amino-fimctionalized silanes". Representative hydrophobic amines include benzylamine, cyclohexylamine, hexylamine, methylhexylamine, phenethylamine, octylamine, oleylamine, decylamine, dodecylanrine, octadecylamine, and the like. Representative amino-functionalized silanes include amines of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein p is about 5 to about 500, available from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI aminoethylpropyl silicone compounds available from Noveon, Cleveland, OH under the tradename Ultrasil and from Siltech Corporation, Toronto, Ontario, Canada under the tradename Silamine; and amine functional silicones including Dow Corning® 8220, Dow Corning® 939, Dow Corning® 949, Dow Corning® 2-8194, all available from Dow Corning, Midland, MI, and Silicone SM 253 available from General Electric, Waterford, NY.<br>
"Hydrophobically modified polymer" and "hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide" mean a polyacrylamide as defined herein wherein a portion of the amido (-C(O)NH2) groups along the polymer backbone is modified by transamidation with a hydrophobic amine. Accordingly, in addition to repeating units derived from cationic monomers and any anionic monomers the hydrophobically modified polymer comprises repeating units having the following structures where NRaRb represents the hydrophobic group resulting from transamidation with a hydrophobic amine and M is H or a base addition salt.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
"Polyacrylamide" means a polymer formed by polymerization of acrylamide, one or more cationic monomers and any anionic monomers as defined herein under free radical forming conditions. Suitable polyacrylamides are commercially available in emulsion, dispersion, solution and powder form or can be prepared by standard methods used for free radical polymerization of vinyl monomers.<br>
"RSV" stands for Reduced Specific Viscosity. Within a series of polymer homologs which are substantially linear and well solvated, "reduced specific viscosity (RSV)" measurements for dilute polymer solutions are an indication of polymer chain length and average molecular weight according to Paul J. Flory, in "Principles of Polymer Chemistry", Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY., © 1953, Chapter VII, "Determination of Molecular Weights", pp. 266-316. The RSV is measured at a given polymer concentration and temperature and calculated as follows:<br>
(EquationRemoved)<br>
n = viscosity of polymer solution<br>
n0 = viscosity of solvent at the same temperature<br>
c — concentration of polymer in solution.<br>
The units of concentration "c" are (grams/100 ml or g/deciliter). Therefore, the units of RSV are dL/g. In this patent application, a 1.0 molar sodium chloride solution is used for measuring RSV, unless specified. The polymer concentration in this solvent is 0.100 g/dL. The RSV is measured at 30 °C. The viscosities n andn0 are measured<br>
using a Cannon Ubbelohde semimicro dilution viscometer, size 75. The viscometer is mounted in a perfectly vertical position in a constant temperature bath adjusted to 30 ± 0.02 °C. The error inherent in the calculation of RSV is about 2 dL/g. When two polymer homologs within a series have similar RSV's that is an indication that they have similar molecular weights.<br>
"Cosmetically acceptable excipient" means a non-toxic, non-irritating substance which when mixed with the hydrophobically modified polymer of this invention makes the polymer more suitable to be applied to hair or skin.<br>
In an embodiment, the hydrophobically modified polymer of this invention is prepared by transamidation of amido (-C(O)NH2) groups of a cationic polyacrylamide with about 0.1 about 10 mole percent of one or more hydrophobic amines by heating at elevated temperature and pressure.

Example 1<br>
Modification of acrylamide-diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymer with<br>
hexadecylamine.<br>
To a Parr reactor is added an aqueous solution of acrylamide-diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymer solution (69.5:30.5 mole percent, 20 percent polymer actives, 225 g), a mixture of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (50%, 2.3 g) and aqueous sodium metabisulfite solution (15%, 19.2 g) and deionized water (200 g). Finely ground hexadecylamine is then added and the mixture is thoroughly stirred. The reactor is then sealed, the stirring is set to the maximum setting and the reactor is pressurized with nitrogen and vented (repeat five times). The reactor is then sealed, heated to 140 °C and maintained at 140 °C for five hours. Heating is then stopped and the reactor is allowed to cool to ambient temperature to provide an aqueous solution of hydrophobically modified polymer. The properties of representative hydrophobically modified polymers is shown in Table 1. In Table 1, AcAm stands for acrylamide, DADMAC for diallyldimethylammonium chloride and MAPTAC for methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>

Example 2<br>
Preparation of a hydrophobically modified polymer solution.<br>
The aqueous polymer solution of Example 1 (445 g) is transferred to a flask and heated to 85 °C with stirring. A mixture of methyl paraben (0.6 g), propyl paraben (0.12 g) and deionized water (30 g) is heated to dissolve the parabens and then added to the hot polymer solution. The mixture is stirred at 85 °C for one hour and then cooled to ambient temperature to provide the hydrophobically modified polymer solution.<br>
In the following examples, "C8 Polymer" means a 69.5 mole percent acrylamide/30.5 mole percent diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymer modified with octylamine. "C12 Polymer" means a 69.5 mole percent acrylamide/30.5 mole percent diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymer modified with dodecylamine. "C16 Polymer" means a 69.5 mole percent acrylamide/30.5 mole percent diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymer modified with hexadecylamine.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a representative shampoo.<br>
The components shown in Table 2 are added in the order listed with complete mixing after each addition. The batch is heated to 55°C to 65 °C to melt cocamide MIPA and the batch pH is adjusted to 5.5 to 6.5 with lactic acid. The preservatives are added at a temperature less than about 40 °C. The polymer is diluted with water to result in a total batch of about 200 g and the mixture is stirred for about 15 minutes.

Example 4<br>
Evaluation of base shampoo containing different levels of hydrophobically modified<br>
polymer.<br>
Representative shampoo formulations prepared according to the method of Example 3 are tested for foam stability and viscosity. Viscosity measurements are obtained using a Brookfield DV-I+Viscometer (Middleboro, MA). The results are illustrated in the Table 3. It is clear that the representative polymer shows synergetic effect of viscosity with shampoo system. The viscosity plays a relatively important role in hair care product since thick in viscosity can be perceived by consumer as luxuries or richness. The shampoos with and without polymer are also tested for foaming property. Polymer, especially conditioning polymer, usually has an adverse effect on the foaming property to the shampoo. The addition of representative polymer in the shampoo increases the foaming time for almost 3 times.<br>

polymer.<br>
A natural shampoo formulation prepared as described in Example 5 is evaluated for viscosity, lather rinse off time and slip. The shampoo is slightly sticky due to glucose/ethoxyate. The results are shown in Table 5. The formulation is unproved by the addition of hydrophobically modified polymer that reduced the sticky feel from the control base. Overall, the hydrophobically modified polymer added to shampoo makes the foam feel slightly creamier than the control without polymer.<br>

Example 7<br>
Evaluation of a commercial shampoo containing a representative hydrophobically modified polymer.<br>
Representative polymers of this invention modified with C8 and C12 alkyl groups (0.25 weight percent) are placed into Suave® Shampoo to confirm that samples remain clear. Suave Natural Strawberry shampoo is also investigated to prove the principle that hydrophobically modified polymers may be post-added to existing formulations. Typically, conditioning polymer added to these systems produces haziness. The C8 and C12 polymers added to these systems maintain better clarity and added slip and creaminess to the formulation. After three months, the Suave® Mountain Strawberry shampoo base remain clear with the C8  and C12 polymer. Polyquaternium-7, an example of a typical conditioning polymer, post-added to this formulation remains cloudy. The introduction of the hydrophobically modified polymer serves to increase the potential surfactant compatibility with the ALS/ALES surfactant system of the Suave shampoo base.<br>
Example 8<br>
Evaluation of foaming Properties of shampoo containing a representative<br>
hydrophobically modified polymer.<br>
A representative shampoo composition prepared using a polymer modified with a C12 alkyl group having the ingredients shown in Table 6 is prepared and evaluated in the Hart de George Foam Test. The test results show that hydrophobically modified polymer creates more stable shampoo foams and therefore a longer drain time (23 seconds for a shampoo formulation prepared with a polymer modified with a C12 hydrophobic group compared to 8.3 seconds for a shampoo formulation prepared with unmodified polymer).<br>

Instrumental wet combing evaluation of hydrophobically modified polymer.<br>
Wet combing is a typical testing method used to illustrate the conditioning property of substances brought to hair care formulations. The hair tress is treated with 0.5% active solution and then rinsed. The treated hair tress is then tested in DiaStron Tensile Tester (MTT160, Hampshire, UK) for combing force. The lower amount of combing force needed in the test means the hair tress is well conditioned. The following Tables 7 and 8 indicate that the hair tresses treated with representative polymers have superior combing properties.<br>

The wet detangling wet combing and lubricity panel tests are conducted to assess conditioner formulations prepared as in Example 10 as follows.<br>
1.	Trained evaluators able to reliably differentiate between damaged and treated hair<br>
tresses perform the tests.<br>
2.	The tests are carried out with a total of three replicates per panel.<br>
3.	For each test, an untreated dark-bleached tress and a conditioner treated tress serve<br>
as references.<br>
4.	Each tress is treated with 1 ml of product and massaged into the tress for 60<br>
seconds, followed by rinsing under 38 °C tap water for 30 seconds.<br>
5.	Tresses are detangled and the panel is set up. Each tress is dipped three times in<br>
500 ml of deionized water to reintroduce tangles. The excess water is then<br>
removed using a gloved hand.<br>
6.	Panelists use the wide end of the black plastic Sally comb to detangle two times.<br>
7.	Next, panelists utilize the small tooth portion to wet comb the tresses twice.<br>
8.	The lubricity is evaluated by combing the tress by a down and up cycle four times<br>
to evaluate interfiber friction.<br>
9.	After each test, tresses are dipped three times in deionized water to reintroduce<br>
tangles and excess water removed with a gloved hand.<br>
Five panelists typically rate the tresses (1 = high friction to 5 = low friction). The results are shown in Table 10-12. Higher detangling wet combing and lubricity numbers are indicative of better performance.<br>

Evaluation of smoothness and film evaluation of moisturizing smoothie gel.<br>
Smoothness and film evaluation of a smoothie gel formulation according to Table 13 is conducted using a panel test as follows.<br>
Table 13 Moisturizing Smoothie Gel<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Panel test of smooth feel and film.<br>
1.	Prepare a one gram sample, six inches in length each of virgin hair (International<br>
Hair Importers, Bellerose, New York, USA).<br>
2.	Apply one gram of polymer onto tresses. Tresses are stroked 25 times to ensure<br>
coverage.<br>
3.	Comb each tress with the wide end of the Sally styling comb to detangle.<br>
4.	Allow samples to air dry.<br>
5.	Randomized panelists run their fingers from top to bottom of the hair tresses and<br>
rate tresses according to intensity (l=not smooth to 5= very smooth) and film<br>
stiffness (l=not stiff to 5=very stiff).<br>
Slippery feel can aid the aesthetics of a product and allow hair fibers to slide past one another. This is an important goal of any conditioning product. A panel evaluated the slippery and smooth feel of the formulations from the formulation above using the following protocol. The results are tabulated in Table 14.<br>

Evaluation of hydrophobically modified polymer in hair styling applications.<br>
Representative formulations containing hydrophobically modified polymers are tested for curl retention, an evaluation tool for styling applications.<br>
Six inch long, bleached, and pretabbed hair tresses are available from International Hair Importes and Products Inc.<br>
Six inch long, bleached, and hand made hair tresses are available from DeMeo Brothers Inc.<br>
The tresses are prepared for testing by cutting 1/8" width of hair from the pretabbed hah- tress (0.4 g for each tress). The hair tress is wetted with water and then 0.3 g of sodium laureth sulfate is massaged onto the hair tress from top to bottom for 1 minute. The hair tress is then rinsed under 40 ± 2°C tap water for 1 minute. The washed hair tresses are soaked in deionized water overnight.<br>
Clean hair tresses are immersed in a 0.5 weight percent aqueous polymer solution for 2 minutes. The excess solution is squeezed from the tress with gloved fingers. Each tress is combed to detangle with the wide end of Sally Styling Combs, then the hair is rolled onto a roller (11/16" indiameter). The hah1 rolls are placed in a<br>
50% relative humidity room overnight. The next day, the hair is unwound from each roller and the curled hair is placed in a 90% relative humidity chamber. The length of the curl (fall-out) is measured every 15 minutes for 2 hours and curl retention is calculated by the following equation:<br>
(EquationRemoved)<br>
Where	L = Length of hair tress fully extended<br>
Lo = Length of hair tress at beginning of experiment Lt = length of hair tress at time of measurement<br>

Evaluation of spreading ability of various surfactants and polymers on Parafilm for<br>
skin care.<br>
This study is performed as a quick screening method to approximate wetting behavior as described below.<br><br>
1.	50μI of a 0.2%, 1.0% solution or dispersion is pipetted onto flat sheets of 10cm x<br>
l0cmParafilmWax.<br>
2.	After five minutes, the largest diameter of the droplet is measured. Triplicate<br>
samples are measured. The experiment is performed under ambient conditions<br>
(room temperature is 23 °C).<br>
3.	A spreading factor is calculated as the ratio of the test solution diameter to the<br>
distilled water diameter (0.6 cm or test average of three droplets).<br>
The results are shown in Table 24.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Formulations containing hydrophobically modified polymers, even with low hydrophobic substitution, are found to be surface active. Results show that the surface activity increases with alkyl chain length. C16 polymer is more surface active than C12 and C12 polymer self-associates more than the C8 polymer due to its foamy, viscous nature.<br>
Examples 23-26<br>
Representative skin care formulations containing hydrophobically modified polymers.<br>
Polymers of this invention can also be utilized for treating the skin. Without being bound by theory, polymers of this invention may form a protective film on the skin or nails. Skin care lotion formulations are shown in Examples 23-26.<br>
In facial smoothing cream the addition of hydrophobically modified polymer creates very nice viscosity build that cannot be achieved with just salt alone. A representative formulation is shown in Table 25.<br>

The Facial Smoothing Cream base [1.27% xanthan/1.9% magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS)] viscosity is significantly enhanced by the addition of<br>
*<br>
0.25% C8 polymer. The initial viscosity of the base without polymer is 6600cps (5/20 30 sec at 23.5 °C). The viscosity upon addition of 0.25% C8 polymer is 16000cps (6/20).<br>
The hydrophobically modified polymers may be utilized as primary or secondary conditioning agents. They may be secondary for thickening, moisturizing, enhancing foam, forming films and perhaps stabilizing emulsion or dispersions.<br>
