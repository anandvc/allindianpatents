FIGs. 2 and 3 are perspective views of a vessel stopper according to one embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 4 is a sectional view showing a state that the vessel stopper is mounted at a vessel opening according to one embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 5 is a bottom view of the vessel stopper according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
jhe vessel stopper 2 according to the present invention comprises: a body 16 mounted at a vessel opening 12 through which the contents stored in a vessel 10 are discharged outwardly, and having a space therein; a<br><br>
mounting unit 22 formed at a low/er side of the body 16, for mounting the body 16 at the vessel opening 12; and a sealing member removing unit 18 formed in the body 16, for removing a sealing member 20 sealed at the vessel opening 12 when the stopper 2 is separated from the vessel opening 12.<br>
The vessel 10 stores a storage item of a fluid state therein, and the sealing member 20 for protecting the storage item contained in the vessel 10 by sealing the vessel opening 12 is attached to the vessel opening 12 through w/hich the storage item is discharged outwardly. The sealing member 20 is preferably formed of a material such as paper or an aluminum thin plate capable of being easily removed by a knife, etc.<br>
Since the sealing member 20 is removed by the sealing member removing unit 18, a skirt portion for removing the sealing member 20 by a hand is not necessary. That is, in the conventional art, a certain amount of skirt portion is wound on an outer circumferential surface of the vessel opening in order to remove the sealing member by a hand after removing the vessel stopper. However, in the present invention, since the sealing member 20 is removed by the sealing member removing unit 18, the sealing member 20 is mounted only at the vessel opening thereby to minimize a usage amount of the sealing member 20,<br>
The body 16 has a cylindrical shape of which upper and lower sides are respectively opened, and is composed of: a first body 24 where the sealing member removing unit 18 is formed; and a second body 26 having an inner diameter larger than that of the first body 24 and provided with the<br><br>
mounting unit 22 for mounting the body 16 at the vessel opening 12, A plurality of protrusions 28 for easily turning the vessel stopper 2 by a hand are formed at an outer circumferential surface of the body 16. A handgrip 36 to be held and pulled when the body 16 is detached from the vessel opening 12 is formed at a lower end of the body 16,<br>
A stopping protrusion 30 is formed at the open upper portion of the body 16 in a circumferential direction thereof- Also, a cover member 32 is mounted at the stopping protrusion 30 thus to close the open upper portion of the body 16 and thereby to protect the sealing member removing unit 18 mounted in the body 16,<br>
The cover member 32 is formed as a disc shape, and is preferably provided with a handgrip 34 for easily detaching the cover member 32 from the body 16 by a hand at one side thereof.<br>
A supporting rib 38 is protruded at an inner circumferential surface of a connection.portion between the first body 24 and the second body 26 in a circumferential direction thus to be adhered to an upper surface of the vessel opening 12 where the sealing member 20 is mounted. That is, the sealing member 20 is adhered to the upper surface of the vessel opening 12 by the supporting rib 38 thereby to maintain a sealing state.<br>
The mounting unit 22 is preferably constructed as a stopping protrusion formed at an inner circumferential surface of the second body 26 and stopped by a stopping rib 40 formed at an upper end of the vessel opening 12 for maintaining a state that the vessel stopper 2 is mounted at the vessel opening 12-<br><br>
The sealing member removing unit 18 includes: a connection portion 42 connected to an inner circumferential surface of the body 16; a pressing plate 44 connected to the connection portion 42 and pressed by a user; and a plurality of cutting units 46 formed at a lower surface of the pressing plate 44 in a circumferential direction with a certain interval, for punching the sealing member 20 by being moved downwardly when the pressing plate 44 is pressed and for cutting the sealing member 20 when the body 16 is rotated-<br>
The connection portion 42 is formed as a thin film of a dome shape connected between an inner circumferential surface of the first body 24 of the body 16 and an outer circumferential surface of the pressing plate 44. The connection portion 42 is elastically deformed when the pressing plate 44 is pressed by a force more than a certain intensity, thereby moving the pressing plate 44 downwardly.<br>
Since the connection portion 42 is connected between the inner circumferential surface of the body 16 and the outer circumferential surface of the pressing plate 44, the connection portion 42 seals the second body 26 and elastically supports the current position of the pressing plate 44, That is, when the pressing plate 44 is upwardly protruded without being pressed, the connection portion 42 maintains the current position of the pressing plate 44 while maintaining a convex dome shape. Also, when the pressing plate 44 is pressed by a force more than a certain intensity, the connection portion 42 is elastically deformed as a concave shape thus to support the state that the pressing plate is pressed.<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a sectional view taken along line VI-VI of FIG- 4 showing the pressing plate of the vessel stopper according to the present invention.<br>
The pressing plate 44 is provided with a pressing portion 50 protruded to be pressed by a user at the center of an upper surface thereof, and is provided with a reinforcing rib 52 for uniformly dispersing a force applied when the pressing portion 50 is pressed to the entire pressing plate 44 at the upper surface thereof. The reinforcing rib 52 is radially formed at the upper surface of the pressing plate 44, and the number of the reinforcing rib 52 is the same as the number of the cutting unit 46-<br>
As shown in FIG.7, the cutting unit 46 includes: a plurality of supporting portion 56 formed at a lower side of the pressing plate 44 in a circumferential direction with a certain interval; a punching portion 58 extended downwardly from the end portion of the supporting portion 56 and moved downwardly at the time of pressing the pressing plate 44, for punching the sealing member 20; a cutter 60 formed at both lateral surfaces of the supporting portion 56 and rotated together with the body 16 at the time of rotating the body 16, for cutting the sealing member 20 as a circular shape; and an accommodation portion 62 for accommodating the sealing member 20 that has been removed by the cutter 60 at the vessel opening 12.<br>
The supporting portion 56 is formed as a flat plate having a certain curvature radius and arranged at the edge of the lower surface of the pressing plate 44 with a certain interval, and is provided with the cutter 60 for cutting  the  sealing   member 20  at  both  lateral  surfaces  thereof.  The<br><br>
supporting portion 56 is provided with a cutter 64 for punching the sealing member 20 like the punching portion 58 at both lateral surfaces of the lower end thereof.<br>
The punching portion 58 is formed at the lower end of the supporting portion 56 with a width narrower than a width of the supporting portion 58, and has an end portion sharply formed to easily punch the sealing member 20.<br>
The accommodation portion 62 is extended from the end portion of the punching portion 58 to an inner side of the body 16 with a certain inclination angle, and mounts the outer circumferential surface of the sealing member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening 12.<br>
Operation of the vessel stopper according to the present invention will be explained as follows.<br>
FIGs. 8 and 9 are operational state views of the vessel stopper according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, in order to discharge the contents stored in the vessel 10 outwardly, the cover member 32 mounted at the upper side of the body 16 is uncovered. That is, as the user pulls the cover member with grasping the handgrip 34, the cover member 32 is detached from the upper surface of the body 16. Then, as shown in FIG, 8, when the pressing plate 44 is pressed with a force more than a certain intensity, the connection portion 42 is elastically deformed and at the same time the pressing plate 44 is downwardly moved. According to this, the punching portion 58 of the cutting unit 46 formed at the lower side of the pressing plate 44 punches the edge of<br><br>
the sealing member 20.<br>
Then, when the body 16 is rotated, the cutting unit 46 is rotated together with the body 16 and thereby the cutter 60 formed at both lateral surfaces of the supporting portion 56 cuts the sealing member 20 as a circular shape. At this time, the sealing member 20 that has been cut by the cutter 60 is fitted into the accommodation portion 62. Then, as shown in FIG. 9, when the body 16 is upwardly pulled with grasping the handgrip 36 formed at the body 16, the stopping protrusion 22 formed at the inner circumferential surface of the body 16 is detached from the stopping rib 40 formed at the upper surface of the vessel opening 12 thereby to detach the vessel stopper 2 from the vessel opening 12.<br>
According to this, the sealing member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening 12 is fitted into the accommodation portion 62 formed in the body 16 thereby to be stored in the vessel stopper 2.<br>
in the vessel stopper according to one embodiment of the present invention, the user presses the pressing plate 44 and then rotates the body 16 thereby to cut the sealing member 20 by the cutting unit 46. Then, when the vessel stopper 2 is detached from the vessel opening 12, the sealing member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening 12 is stored in the body 16 thereby to facilitate usage and to prevent an environment pollution due to a discard of the sealing member 20,<br>
FIG. 10 is a sectional view of a vessel stopper according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The vessel stopper according to the second embodiment is the same<br><br>
as the vessel stopper according to the first embodiment except a mounting unit mounted at the vessel opening.<br>
That is, in the vessel stopper aforementioned in the first embodiment, applied is one-touch method that the vessel stopper is detached from the vessel opening 12 when the user pulls the vessel stopper with grasping the handgrip. On the contrary, in the vessel stopper according to the second embodiment, applied is a spiral coupling method that the vessel stopper is detached from the vessel opening 12 when the user turns the vessel stopper.<br>

Also, a skirt portion 76 for maintaining a state that the vessel stopper is mounted at the vessel opening 12 is formed at the lower end of the body 16.<br>
Operation of the vessel stopper according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained as follows.<br>
When the pressing plate 44 is pressed with a force more than a certain intensity, the connection portion 42 is elastically deformed and at the same time the pressing plate 44 is downwardly moved. According to this, the punching portion 58 of the cutting unit 46 formed at the lower side of the pressing plate 44 punches the edge of the sealing member 20.<br>
Then, when the body 16 is rotated in an open direction, the female<br><br>
screw portion 70 is detached from the male screw portion 72 formed at the vessel opening 12. When the body 16 is rotated, the cutter 60 of the cutting unit 46 is rotated together with the body 16 and at the same time cuts the sealing member 20 in a circumferential direction. Also, the sealing member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening 12 is accommodated in the accommodation portion 62 formed at the inner circumferential surface of the body 16.<br>
The vessel stopper according to the second embodiment of the present invention can be applied to any vessel that a vessel stopper is spirally-coupled to a vessel opening thus to be detached from the vessel opening once the vessel stopper is rotated.<br>
FIG. 11 is a sectional view of a vessel stopper according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The vessel stopper according to the third embodiment of the present invention is the same as the vessel stopper 2 aforementioned in the first embodiment or the second embodiment except that a spoon 78 with which the contents stored in the vessel 10 are taken is mounted in the vessel stopper 2,<br>
That is, the vessel stopper 2 according to the third embodiment is provided with a holding portion 80 at an inner circumferential surface of an upper side of the body 16, and the spoon 78 is mounted at the holding portion 80.<br>
The vessel stopper 2 according to the third embodiment is used when contents taken by the spoon 78 are stored in the vessel 10. First, the cover<br><br>

The connection portion 42. the pressing plate 44, and the cutting unit are equal to those of the first embodiment, thereby omitting their explanations.<br>
The punch 88 is sharply protruded as a conic shape at the end of a rod portion 90 extended downwardly from the center of the lower side of the pressing plate 44 thus to punch the center of the sealing member 20 and thereby to form a hole 92. Through the hole 92, the contents 84 stored in the body 16 is introduced into the vessel 10.<br>
Since an outer diameter of the punch 88 is larger than that of the rod portion 90, a sufficient space for passing the contents 84 stored in the body 16 can be obtained even if the rod portion 90 passes through the hole 92 formed by the punch 88.<br>
Operation of the vessel stopper according to the fourth embodiment will be explained as follows.<br>
When the pressing plate 44 is pressed by a certain force after the cover member 32 is detached from the body 16, the cutting unit 46 is<br><br>
downwardly moved thus to punch the edge of the sealing member 20. At the same time, the punch 88 is downwardly moved thus to punch the center of the sealing member 20 thereby to form the hole 92. According to this, the contents 84 stored in the body 16 is introduced into the vessel 10 through the hole 92, and is mixed with the contents 86 stored in the vessel 10.<br>
When the contents 84 stored in the body 16 is completely introduced into the vessel 10, the user rotates the body 16 and thereby the cutter 60 of the cutting unit 18 cuts the sealing member 20 as a circular shape. If the vessel stopper is detached from the vessel opening 12, the seating member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening 12 is stored in the accommodation portion 62 inside the body 16.<br>
FIG. 14 is an upper surface view of a vessel stopper according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 15 is a sectional view taken along line VII-VII of FIG. 14; FIG. 16 is an enlargement view of 'B' of FIG.15; and FIG. 17 is an operational state view of the vessel stopper according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The vessel stopper according to the fifth embodiment is applied to a vessel having a relatively large vessel opening 16. In the vessel stopper, a plurality of sealing member removing units 63 are formed in a circumferential direction of the body 16.<br>
That is, in the vessel stopper 2 according to the fifth embodiment, a partition wall 94 of a disc shape is formed at the inner circumferential surface of the body 16, and at least two mounting holes 96 are formed in the circumferential direction  of the partition  wall  94.  The sealing  member<br><br>
removing unit 63 is formed in each mounting hole 96.<br>
The sealing member removing unit 63 includes: a connection portion 65 formed as a flexible form and connected to an inner circumferential surface of the mounting hole 96; a pressing plate 67 mounted at an inner circumferential surface of the connection portion 65 and pressed by a user; and a cutting unit 69 formed at a lower surface of the pressing plate 67 for cutting a sealing member 20,<br>
A width T1 of the connection portion 65 positioned at the edge of the partition wall 94 is wider than a width T2 positioned inside the partition wall 94, so that the pressing plate 67 is pressed with an inclined state.<br>
The pressing plate 67 is formed as a triangular flat-plate so as to be easily pressed with an inclined state.<br>
The cutting unit of the fifth embodiment of the present invention has the same shape as that of the aforementioned embodiment except that only one cutting unit 69 is formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 67,<br>
Operation of the vessel stopper according to the fifth embodiment will be explained. When the user downwardly presses each pressing plate 67 mounted in a circumferential direction of the partition wall 94, the connection portion 65 is elastically deformed and thereby the pressing plates 67 are downwardly moved. According to this, the cutting unit 60 formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 67 punches the sealing member 20,<br>
Under this state, when the vessel stopper is rotated, the cutting unit 69 cuts the sealing member 20 and the cut sealing member 20 is stored in the vessel stopper.<br><br>
According to the vessel stopper of the first to fourth embodiments, since one sealing member removing unit is used when the vessel opening 12 is large, the size of the pressing plate 67 becomes large and a great force for pressing the pressing plate 67 is required. Also, since the pressing plate 67 is not horizontally maintained easily at the time of pressing the pressing plate 67, cutting units that do not punch the sealing member exist among the plurality of cutting units formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 67.<br>
Therefore, in order to solve said problem, at least two sealing member removing units 63 are installed in a circumferential direction of the partition wall 94 with the same interval in the fifth embodiment. According to this, the user can press each pressing plate 67 with less force thereby to have a convenient usage, and all the cutting units 69 punch the sealing member 20,<br>
FIG. 18 is a sectional view of a vessel stopper according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 19 is an operational state view of the vessel stopper according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The vessel stopper according to the sixth embodiment includes: a body 5 mounted at the vessel opening 12; and a cutting unit 7 formed at an inner side surface of the body 5, for punching the sealing member 20 attached to the vessel opening 12 when the body 5 is rotated in a close direction of the vessel, and for cutting the sealing member 20 and thereby storing the sealing member 20 in the body 5 when the body 5 is rotated in an open direction of the vessel 10,<br>
The body 5 has a cylindrical shape of which upper side is closed. A<br><br>
female screw portion 70 spirally-coupled to a male screw portion 72 fonned at the outer circumferential surface of the vessel opening 12 is formed at the inner circumferential surface of the lower side of the body 5, Also. 3 skirt portion 9 for maintaining a state that the vessel stopper is fixed to the vessel opening 12 is formed at the lower end of the body 5.<br>
The skirt portion 9 has a certain interval H from the upper surface of the vessel 10, so that the body 5 can be rotated as much as the interval H in a dose direction of the vessel.<br>
The cutting unit 7 includes: a plurality of supporting portion 56 formed at an inner side surface of the body 5 in a circumferential direction with a certain interval; a punching portion 58 extended downwardly from the end portion of the supporting portion 56 and moved downwardly at the time of pressing the pressing plate 44, for punching the sealing member 20; a cutter 60 formed at both lateral surfaces of the supporting portion 56 and rotated together with the body 16 at the time of rotating the body 16, for cutting the sealing member 20 as a circular shape; and an accommodation portion 62 for accommodating the sealing member 20 that has been removed by the cutter 60 at the vessel opening 12.<br>
Operation of the vessel stopper according to the sixth embodiment will be explained as follows. First, if the body 5 is rotated in a close direction of the vessel 10, the body 5 is downwardly moved. At this time, the body 5 can be downwardly moved as much as the interval H since the skirt portion 9 mounted at the lower side of the body 5 has the interval H from the upper surface of the vessel 10.<br><br>
According to this, the cutting unit 7 formed at the lower surface of the body 5 punches the sealing member 20, Under this state, if the body 5 is rotated in an open direction of the vessel 10, the cutting unit 7 is rotated together with the body 5 and at the same time cuts the sealing member 20 as a circular shape. Also, the sealing member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening 12 is fitted into the accommodation portion 62 formed in the body 5 thus to be stored in the vessel stopper.<br>
FIG. 20 is a sectional view of a vessel stopper according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 21 is an operational state view of the vessel stopper according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A sealing member removing unit 150 according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention includes: a connection portion 152 elastically and deformably connected to an inner circumferential surface of the body 16; a pressing plate 154 connected to an outer circumferential surface of the connection portion 152 and pressed by a user; and a cutting unit 156 formed at a lower surface of the pressing plate 154 in a circumferential direction, for cutting an outer circumferential surface of the sealing member 20 by being downwardly moved when the pressing plate 154 is pressed and then storing in the body.<br>
The connection portion 152 is formed as a thin film of a dome shape connected between the inner circumferential surface of the body 16 and the outer circumferential surface of the pressing plate 154. When the pressing plate 154 is pressed by a force more *han a certain degree, the connection<br><br>
portion 152 is elastically deformed and the pressing plate 154 is downwardly moved.<br>
The pressing plate 154 is formed as a circular plate, and is provided with the cutting unit 156 at the lower surface thereof.<br>
The cutting unit 156 is composed of: a supporting portion formed at the lower side of the pressing ptate 154 as a cylindrical shape: a cutter 162 formed at the end of the supporting portion 160 as a cylindrical blade shape, for cutting the sealing member 20 as a circular shape at the time of pressing the pressing plate 154; and an accommodation portion 164 extended inwardly at an inner circumferential surface of the supporting portion 160 with a certain width, for accommodating the sealing member 20 that has been cut by the cutter 162.<br>
At least one stopping portion 170 serving as a stopper for punching the sealing member 20 when the pressing plate 154 is pressed and thereby accommodating the sealing member 20 to the inner circumferential surface of the body 16 is formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 154.<br>
The stopping portion 170 is composed of; a supporting bar 172 perpendicularly formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 154; and a stopping jaw 174 formed as a corn shape at the end of the supporting bar 172 and stopping the sealing member 20,<br>
Operation of the sealing member removing unit according to the seventh embodiment will be explained as follows.<br>
When the user presses the pressing plate 154 after removing the cover member 32 mounted at the upper end of the body 16, the connection<br><br>
portion 152 is elastically deformed and the pressing plate 154 is downwardly moved. According to this, the cutting unit 156 formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 154 is downwardly moved thereby to cut the edge of the sealing member 20 mounted at the vessel opening and then to accommodate the edge to the inner circumferential surface of the body 16,<br>
More specifically, when the pressing plate 154 is downwardly moved, the cylindrical cutter 162 is downwardly moved thereby to cut the sealing member as a circular shape. The sealing member 20 that has been removed at the vessel opening 12 is stopped by the stopping portion 170 thereby to be accommodated in the body 16,<br>
At this time, the stopping jaw 174 formed at the lower surface of the pressing plate 154 is also moved downwardly thus to punch the sealing member 20 and stop the sealing member 20, thereby more stably accommodating the sealing member 20 in the body 16.<br>
Then, when the user pulls the vessel opening upwardly with grasping the handghp 36, the vessel opening is separated from the vessel 10 and thereby the sealing member 20 that has been removed from the vessel opening is accommodated in the body,<br>
FIG. 22 is a sectional view of a vessel stopper having a sealing member removing unit according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The sealing member removing unit 180 according to the eighth embodiment has the same as the sealing member removing unit 150 of the seventh embodiment except the structure of a cutting unit 188.<br><br>
That is, the cutting unit 188 includes; a supporting portion 182 formed at the edge of a lower side of the pressing plate 154 as a cylindrical shape; a cutter 184 formed at the end of the supporting portion 182 as a saw edge shape, for cutting the sealing member 20 as a circular shape; and an accommodation portion 186 protruded at an inner side surface o the supporting portion 182, for accommodating the sealing member 20 that has been removed by the cutter 184.<br>
The cutter 184 constructed as a triangular saw edge is repeatedly formed is downwardly moved at the time of pressing the pressing plate 154, and cuts the sealing member 20 as a circular shape.<br>
In the vessel stopper according to the present invention, the sealing member removing unit is installed in the stopper and the pressing plate of the sealing member removing unit is pressed before opening the stopper. Then, if the user opens the stopper by rotating it, the sealing member is automatically removed from the vessel opening thereby to have a convenient usage.<br>
Also, since the sealing member that has been removed from the vessel opening is stored in the accommodation portion inside the stopper, an environment pollution resulting from that the sealing member is discarded outside can be prevented.<br>
Additionally, the contents different from the contents stored in the vessel is stored in the stopper thus to be introduced into the vessel when the stopper is detached from the vessel. According to this, the contents stored in the stopper can be mixed with the contents stored in the vessel.<br><br>
Also, the skirt portion for removing the sealing member is not required as the sealing member is removed by the sealing member removing unit, thereby reducing a usage amount of the sealing member and thus reducing a fabrication cost<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
