				<td>The present invention relates to substituted imidazopyridine compounds as melanocortin receptor agonists.<br>
A subject of the present application is novel imidazo-pyridine derivatives. These products have a good affinity for certain sub-types of melanocortm receptors, in particular MC4 receptors. They are particularly useful for treating the pathological states and diseases in which one or more melanocortin receptors are involved. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing said products and their use for the preparation of a medicament.<br>
The melanocortins represent a group of peptides which derive from the same precursor, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and which are structurally close: adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), ß-MSH and -MSH (Eipper B.A. and Mains R.E., Endocr. Rev. 1980, 1, 1-27). The melanocortins perform numerous physiological functions. They stimulate the synthesis of steroids by the adrenal cortex and the synthesis of eumelanin by the melanocytes. They regulate food intake, energy metabolism, sexual function, neuronal regeneration, blood pressure and heart rate, as well as the perception of pain, learning, attention and memory. The melanocortins also possess anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic properties and control the secretion of several endocrine or exocrine glands such as the sebaceous, lacrymal, mammary glands, the prostate and the pancreas (Wikberg J.E. et al. Pharmacol. Res. 2000, 42, 393-420; Abdel-Malek Z.A., Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2001, 58,434-441).<br>
The effects of the melanocortins are mediated by a family of membrane receptors specific to seven transmembrane domains and coupled to the G proteins. Five sub-types of receptors, named MC1 to MC5, have been cloned and characterized to date. These receptors differ in their tissue distribution and by the affinity of the different melanocortins, the MC2 receptors only recognizing ACTH. The stimulation of the melanocortin receptors activates adenylate cyclase with production of cyclic AMP. If the specific functional roles of each of the receptors are not totally explained, the treatment of pathological disorders or diseases can be associated with an affinity for certain sub-types of receptors. Thus the activation of the MCI receptors has been<br><br><br>
associated with the treatment of inflammations, since their blockage has been associated with the treatment of cutaneous cancers. The treatment of nutritional disorders has been associated with MC3 and MC4 receptors, the treatment of obesity with agonists and the treatment of cachexia and anorexia by antagonists. Other indications associated with the activation of MC3 and MC4 receptors are sexual activity disorders, neuropathic pain, anxiety, depression and drug addiction. The activation of MC5 receptors has been associated with the treatment of acne and dermatoses.<br>
Research efforts have therefore focussed on the discovery of non-peptide compounds with a low molecular weight, bio-available by oral route, powerful agonists or antagonists of the melanocortin receptors.<br>
The applicants have found that the novel compounds of general formula (I) described hereafter possess a good affinity for the melanocortin receptors. They act preferentially on MC4 receptors. Said compounds, agonists or antagonists of the melanocortin receptors, can be used for treating pathological states or metabolic diseases, of the nervous or dermatological system, in which one or more melanocortin receptors are involved such as the following examples: inflammatory states, disorders of energy homeostasis, food intake, weight disorders (obesity, cachexia, anorexia), sexual activity disorders (erective disorders), pain and more particularly neuropathic pain. There can also be mentioned mental disorders (anxiety, depression), drug addiction, skin diseases (acne, dermatoses, cutaneous cancers, melanomas). These compounds can also be used to stimulate nerve regeneration.<br>
A subject of the invention is therefore a compound of general formula (I)<br>

As described in diagram A, 2,6-dichloro-3-nitropyridine can be treated with a primary amine in the presence of an organic base such as a tertiary amine or an inorganic base such as potassium or caesium carbonate, in an apolar aprotic solvent such as toluene at a temperature of approximately 20°C for 3-18 hours in order to produce compound (1). The chlorinated derivative (1) can react with a primary or secondary amine, in the presence of an organic base such as a tertiary amine or an inorganic base such as potassium or caesium carbonate, in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or HMPA at a temperature of 20-70°C for 2-18 hours in order to produce compound (2). The nitro function of compound (2) is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of 10% palladium on carbon in an inert solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of 18-25°C, for 2 to 8 hours in order to produce the dianiline (3). Derivative (3) is then treated with an isothiocyanate in the presence of a coupling agent supported or not supported on a resin such as diisopropylcarbodiimide or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-cyclohexylcarbodiimide N-methyl polystyrene resin in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, or chloroform at a temperature of 20-70°C for 2 to 72 hours in order to produce derivative (4). Alternatively, derivative (3) can be treated with an isothiocyanate in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, chloroform or ethanol at a temperature of 20-80°C for 1-16 hours then the resultant thiourea can be treated with yellow mercury (II) oxide in the presence of a catalytic<br>
quantity of sulphur in a polar solvent such as methanol or ethanol for 2 to 24 hours at a temperature of 20-80°C in order to produce (4).<br>

Also included in the field of the present invention, when they can be used, are the salts formed from bases such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. For other examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, reference can be made to "Salt selection for basic drugs", Int. J. Pharm. (1986), 33, 201-217.<br>
A subject of the present Application is also the use of the compounds according to the present invention, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of weight disorders such as obesity, cachexia and more particularly cancer cachexia, AIDS cachexia, old age cachexia, cardiac cachexia, renal cachexia, rheumatoid arthritis cachexia, and anorexia, the treatment of pain and more particularly neuropathic pain, the treatment of mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, the treatment of sexual activity disorders such as erective disorders.<br>

Appropriate solid supports can be, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and wax.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of the invention can also be presented in liquid form, for example, solutions, emulsions, suspensions or syrups. Appropriate liquid supports can be, for example, water, organic solvents such as glycerol or the glycols, as well as their mixtures, in varying proportions, in water, added to oils or pharmaceutically acceptable fats. The sterile liquid compositions can be used for intramuscular, intraperitoneal or sub-cutaneous injections and the sterile compositions can also be administered by intravenous injection.<br>

Pharmacological study<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the present invention for the different sub-types of melanocortin receptors was measured according to procedures analogous to those described hereafter for the MC4 receptors.<br>
Studies of the affinity of the compounds for the MC4 receptors of melanocortins:<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for the MC4 receptors is determined by measuring the inhibition of the binding of [125I]-[Nle4, D-Phe7]-a-MSH to membrane preparations of transfected CHO-K1 cells.<br>
CHO-K1 cells expressing human MC4 receptors in a stable fashion are cultured in an RPMI1640 medium containing 10% of foetal calf serum, 2 mM of glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin and 0.5 mg/ml of G418. The cells are collected with 0.5 mM of EDTA and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The pellet is re-suspended in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) medium and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet is re-suspended in a Tris 50 mM buffer medium at pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The cells are lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 39,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet is re-suspended in Tris 50 mM buffer medium at pH7.4 and centrifuged at 50,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The membranes obtained in this last pellet are stored at -80°C.<br>
Measurement of the competitive inhibition of the binding of [125I]-[Nle4, D-Phe7]-α-MSH to the MC4 receptors is carried out in duplicate using polypropylene 96-well plates. The cell membranes (50 µg of proteins/well) are incubated with [125I]-[Nle4, D-Phe7]-α-MSH (0.5 nM) for 90 minutes at 37°C in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer medium,<br>
pH 7.4, comprising 0.2% of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mM of MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml of bacitracin.<br>
The bonded [125I]-[Nle4, D-Phe7]-α-MSH is separated from the free [125I]-[Nle4, D-Phe7]-a-MSH by filtration through GF/C glass fibre filter plates (Unifilter, Packard) pre-impregnated with 0.1% of polyethylenimine (P.E.I.), using a Filtermate 196 (Packard). The filters are washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 at 0-4°C and the radioactivity present is determined using a counter (Packard Top Count).<br>
The specific binding is obtained by subtracting the non-specific binding (determined in the presence of 0.1 µM of Nle4, D-Phe7-α-MSH) of the total binding. The data are analyzed by computer-assisted non-linear regression (MDL) and the values of the inhibition constants (Ki) are determined.<br>
The agonist or antagonist activity of the MC4 receptors of the compounds of the present invention were determined by measuring the production of cyclic AMP by the CHO-Kl cells transfected by the MC4 receptor.<br>
Measurement of the production of intracellular cyclic AMP via the MC4 receptors:<br>
CHO-Kl cells expressing the MC4 receptors of the melanocortins are cultured in 384-well plates in an RPMI 1640 medium with 10% of foetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml of G418. The cells are washed twice with 50 ul of RPMI medium comprising 0.2% BSA and 0.5 mM of 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX).<br>
In order to measure the agonist effect of a compound, the cells are incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C in the presence of 0.5 mM of IBMX, then stimulation of the production of cyclic AMP is obtained by adding the compound at concentrations comprised between 1 pM and 10 µM in duplicate for 20 minutes at 37°C. The antagonist effect of a compound is measured by the simultaneous addition of Nle4, D-Phe7-α-MSH at concentrations comprised between 1 pM and 10 µM, in the presence of the compound to be tested, at concentrations comprised between 0.1 nM and 10 uM in duplicate for 20 minutes at 37°C.<br>
The reaction medium is eliminated and 80 ul of lysis buffer is added. The intracellular cyclic AMP level is measured by a competition test with fluorescent cyclic AMP (CatchPoint, Molecular Devices).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
