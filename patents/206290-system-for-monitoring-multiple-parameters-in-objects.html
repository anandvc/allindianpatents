SYSTEM AND DEVICE FOR MONITORING MULTIPLE PARAMETERS IN<br>
OBJECTS<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Various types of monitoring devices have been proposed which monitor only a single parameter. There is no device, which is capable of monitoring multiple parameters. Existing devices are not modular in design. Existing devices while monitoring an object fail in achieving their ideal functional objectives since they do not - communicate with the object and/or view/record audio/video data from the object end, locate the object, which is vital for a monitoring device, besides being cumbersome and imposing additional constraints.<br>
Even those devices monitoring a single parameter predominantly monitor distance parameter only; monitor only either increasing or decreasing separation but do not monitor both. Also existing devices do not accurately measure distance between the objects at both close and long range. The speed of communication mediums is high and the amount of signals received by way of reflected signals from multiple objects at ground level are too many to make an accurate calculation of the distance at short ranges.<br>
Existing devices monitor an object within a fixed range and their monitoring is restricted to this fixed range with no provision for enhancing the pre-fixed range for continuous monitoring when object moves outside the purview of this fixed range.<br>
There is a need for a device and system, which overcomes the aforesaid limitations.<br><br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a simple and cost effective integrated multifunctional digital system that is capable of continuous communicating, monitoring, tracking and locating; single/plurality of objects; for variance in single/multiple parameters at close quarters as well as at long range and provisions for initiating a single or series of actions using plurality of communication tools when a pre-defined parameter is achieved or at the instance of user.<br>
The invention proposes following three kinds of continuous monitoring between transceivers depending on application - 01) between two transceivers 02) one transceiver monitoring multiple transceivers 03) multiple transceivers monitoring single transceiver.<br>
The invention uses mobile transceivers, which can be embedded or detached to be placed on object/entity to be monitored resulting in increased utility value. The two-way communication is achieved by the transceiver being designed and programmed to act both as a receiver and transmitter and whose role can be reversed. The transceivers are designed to communicate with each other using any of the pluralities of commxmication medium. The transceivers can be a separate piece or embedded in plurality of objects, entities. The embedment of the transceivers enables additional functions in existing devices and uses the available features to reduce the cost of the system. For example this device when embedded in a mobile phone enhances its utility from a mere communication device to a monitoring device.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a unique methodology for accurate measurement of distance between transceivers at close range in that device is designed and programmed to intelligently<br><br>
choose multiple cycles of signal transmission between transceivers for time determination to be used in distance calculation, depending on the distance between the transceivers.<br>
The modular design of the device facilitates the incorporation of respective additional modules for monitoring required parameters and interfacing with such parameter measuring devices. This invention uniquely proposes that in advance variant of this device, when an object moves away from the monitoring field of a short range it can be seamlessly monitored by an existing external network through addition of necessary module, resulting in continuous monitoring of the object across a wide spectrum.<br>
The transceivers can also be interfaced with any external network, device, and security/alarm systems to enhance monitoring capability. The transceivers are additionally inbuilt with a paging function, which can be alerted using commercial paging services through a telephone line. The messaging medium between the transceivers could be used for remote operations of any article/device and also can be used to send data/voice information between the transceivers.<br>
Each unit can sound an alarm in the other unit irrespective of the variance in the parameter. One variation of the invention would be alarm being generated in a third transceiver when there is variance in parameters between two transceivers resulting in high degree of flexibility for the user. For example the third transceiver could be embedded in mobile phone enhancing its utility. According to one aspect of the present invention the transceivers shall have Visual Display Units, which can constantly display the parameter values.<br><br>
A particularly advantageous and advance variant of this present invention will have miniaturized microphone, video camera in the target object with a feature to transmit audio/video signals and a provision to view/record these signals continuously beamed from object end and more so when alarm is triggered leading to vital clues such as audio/video profiles facilitating location of the object.<br>
Furthermore the transceiver is inexpensive consumes low power, powered by batteries with a built-in battery level indicator, with facilities to recharge and use solar energy as also to remotely switch the device to standby mode to achieve optimum usage of power resources.<br>
It is also proposed that apart from the standard security features making the invention tamper proof, it will incorporate preventive measure to generate alarm when there is intentional/imintentional removal/falling off of the device from the object being monitored; programmed to prevent jamming by jamming devices; prevent interference of signals from a similar electronic device besides working well in the aircraft environment causing no interference with aircraft control, communication, and navigation equipment.<br>
The present invention has inbuilt flexibility to serve plurality of application including but not limited to - alarm device; security device; measurement device, paging device, persons, objects, entities can be located, tracked and monitored for various parameters; memory aid; reminder mechanism; recording mechanism; data/voice transfer, remote operations of devices; Identification device; Mapping of various parameters; Toys; Robotics; Random access of information from the system for necessary action.<br><br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>
The following detailed description of the invention is supported by the schematically described<br>
embodiment examples, which function only for better understanding and are to be evaluated in<br>
no way as a restriction of the range of protection of the invention.<br>

Detailed Description Of A Preferred Embodiment<br>
The following detailed schematic description functions for the understanding of the invention concept, however, it cannot depict this exhaustively since uncounted construction variations both in the design and functional construction, are possible.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of the transceiver units illustrating the main elements. The invention consists of two separate transceivers, which are unconnected units TRl &amp; TR2 programmed to receive signals only between them. Certain parts of components shown in Figure 1 can be of software/firmware in nature. The process of commimication between transceivers and various components of the transceivers are described below.<br>
Once transceivers are triggered into active mode, TRl monitors various parameter values through the interface circuit (12) for parameter measurement. The encoder unit (02) assembles a message (packet) with sending unit's identity (addresses), receiving xmit's identity (address), data received from interface circuit and any response for command received. The transmitter modulates the message of digitally coded signal and sends the same to TR2. The receiver (03) of<br><br>
TR2 receives the signal demodulates and passes on the data to the decbdef (04), which identifies the sender by decoding the received signal. CPU (05) of TR2 reads the data, commands and signal response from TRl; takes necessary action; processes the data and sends processed information for transmission to TRl. In this manner the process of two-way commimication between transceivers takes place.<br>
The CPU (05) controls all operations of the device and other components; sets the periodic intervals in which encoder has to generate data for transmission; reads/writes from and into the memory unit (06); keeps track of multiple timers (07); whenever there is a signal loss between transceiver, it gives a warning signal; periodically measures and transmits the monitored parameter value; sets and resets the device at appropriate juncture; in case of malfunction in any sub-unit it alerts the user after a time delay; keeps the transceiver in standby mode after a predefined time and activates the unit into operational mode whenever it receives the appropriate signal; keeps track of multiple transceivers; reads/monitors the parameters and takes necessary predefined action; sends input commands to other transceivers.<br>
The power control (08) supplies necessary voltages to various sections, keeps track of the battery charge level, initiates an interrupt routine to the CPU (05) to send message to other transceiver regarding low power level for necessary action. In the standby mode only the receiver (03), decoder (04) and CPU (05) get power supply enabling reduction in the power consumption.<br>
The serial port (09) serves the purpose of interface and communicating with external device and network. The interface circuit (12) for multiple parameter measurement in the transceiver<br><br>
provides information from the parameter measurement device to CPU (05). The reference for parameter monitoring can be preset for different situations.<br>
The input/output unit (10), which also houses a display unit and keypad, displays the response from receiver and transmitter and the information received from the other transceiver. Through the keypad necessary command inputs for transceivers takes place. The output indication is by audio and/or visual and/or vibration. If necessary the user can switch off the indication by pressing a button in the input/output unit.<br>
Both the transceivers contain Audio/video circuits (11), which consists of miniature video or web camera, speaker, microphone and circuits to transmit and receive AudioA^ideo signals between the transceivers. When commercial paging signal is received the video/AF unit (11) and display unit are activated.<br>
Fig 2. Depicts one communication cycle between transceivers. D represents the distance between TRl and TR2.<br>
At close ranges, to eliminate inaccuracy in the measurement of distance between transceivers the device would be designed and programmed to cumulatively measure time taken for "A" cycle of transmission between TRl and TR2. "A" is an integer value varying with communication medium and application. The device would initially measure for "A" cycle and once "D" is approximately known, to improve the accuracy it will change over to measurement of multiples of "A" cycle - say K x A where "K" is the multiplier factor. Depending on the distance the<br><br>
device chooses the "K" value, For example wnen "D" is above 1000 meters,, K value could be 10; between 500 and 1000 meters "K" value could be 25; between 100 and 500 meters "K" value could be 50 and below hvmdred meters "K" value could be 100.<br>
